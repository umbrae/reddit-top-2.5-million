I've since reorganized my finances and purchasing, but there was one last thing that I flip flopped on so many times: Should I get rid of this ridiculous 42"" HD TV and ps3 that I rarely use? I’ve never had cable, but would use it exclusively for movies and Netflix. I would continuously justify having it, but I soon realized that there really was no actual benefit to it. I would spend a large portion of my time doing absolutely nothing, staring at the screen watching Netflix, wasting away my time. One day I had a moment of clarity: I am a mediocre artist, banjo player, guitar player, fisherman, outdoorsman…but damn, am I a professional movie watcher. So I did it, I sold the damn T.V. and the PS3. I emancipated myself from this device that held me down. I want to take that time and devote it to the things that will actually drive creativity and critical thinking. I will read all those books that have been sitting on the shelf for years. I know it will be a transition, but I am in it for the long haul. 

**Edit: Wow, this received a lot more attention than I expected. I was just kind of venting my relief from finally pulling the trigger. Thank you all for the positive feedback and I hope the best to all of you in the same boat.

It’s been 2 months since I decided to greatly reduce the amount of technological clutter in my life as both a way to attempt to improve my focus on non technological hobbies I enjoy, but also as a way to escape the mind numbing perpetual routine of work, couch, Netflix, sleep. So I sold my 42” HD 3D TV, my PS3, and packed my computer away to start the new way of living I had hoped would develop from the absence of these distractions. 

I feel that before I go on, I must fill you in on a bit of back story to the last year of my life. Near the end of 2012, I was heading into the third year of a relationship with a girl I was no longer in love with. My girlfriend and I’s relationship had slowly deteriorated over the previous year and we were finding that our own time was spent in a typical routine of Netflix and sex. Apparently, these were the last two things that gave either of us a real sense of “bonding.” So January rolls around and the eventual messy breakup finally comes to fruition, leaving me in an emotional state of turmoil and depression. So how does one cope with their time after spending every waking moment with the same person for three years? T,V,, beer, and shitty food. So commence the routine of work, couch, Netflix, and sleep. For a good three months this was my life. During the beginning of my relationship I had went from being a fit 23 year old to an overweight 26. I went from being an adventurous youth, to an adult stuck in a job he hated, in a town he hated, with no girlfriend or real reason to give a shit. I deleted every form of social media I was connected to as a way to distance myself from my ex, who would frequently continue to stalk them for any information that I might be attempting to move on with my life.

March, 2013. I decided one day in March to hop back on Reddit and peruse the various amounts of bullshit as a way to brighten my spirits as I was still in the same funk I had been for the past two months. After looking at the typical bullshit posted on the front page, I stumbled upon r/minimalism, which brought me to the other great subs of r/simpleliving, r/frugal, and r/anticonsumption. I was really taken away by the content and began consuming month’s worth of self posts and articles about the steps others had taken to break through the same depressive slump I had found myself in. Soon, I began to look at this T.V. that I owned as more of a hindrance than the prized possession I hoped would impress my friends and family when they came over. So I made the decision to sell it, and then I would rationalize against it, and go back and forth. “Man, I sure paid a lot for this, I should keep it.””No one will want to come over here and hang out if I don’t have a T.V. to entertain them.” This was how I legitimized not selling. Then came that realization that I described in the original post….I was mediocre at so many things except watching T.V. I could dedicate hours to watching T.V., but I would give maybe 10 minutes to playing banjo, or take a year to read a 500 page book. That was the final straw. 

So now here I am a little over two months later. The first thing I did after dumping the T.V. was use the money to fund a trip to the West Coast. In May I went on a two week road trip across the country hiking, fishing, and just enjoying the things I had missed during the last few years. I went to the Red Woods, Portland, the Boise National Forrest, and numerous craft breweries throughout the Midwest. I got home and a week later decided that I wanted to keep living, so I headed off to Bonnaroo for a week and got weird. Honestly, it wasn’t the T.V. as much the routine and failing relationship that prevented me from doing the things I’ve wanted to do with my life. I’ve lost 25 pounds since March as I returned to the gym and running. I quit eating pizza every week and drinking every weekend. I really haven’t progressed on my banjo as well as I wished to have, but that is a work in progress. I am still at the same job, but I’ve signed up to take the GRE and will hopefully be applying to grad schools next year.  

All in all I would say that electronic distractions as a whole, if we allow them, hold us back from achieving the goals that we always say we will reach, but never do. You find that the extra time you have is unlimited in possibilities. T.V. time to me has become no different than all the aggregate time I’ve wasted browsing Reddit or Facebook on my smart phone while hanging out with my friends, or watching a concert through a screen because I felt capturing the moment was more important than living in it. I didn’t take my phone to Bonnaroo, I turn it off now when I’m with my friends and I actively protest social gatherings morphing into YouTube parties. The return to social interaction and the physical and mental stimulation of returning to the trails, the fret board, and the weight room are what brought me out of the year long funk I had fallen into. Getting rid of the T.V. wasn’t a means to an end; it was just the spark that lit the fire under my ass to get back to living. I don’t want to rationalize things any longer because of the comfort, ease, or social standing they provide me, I want to take the hard way and I want own it.  

**Edit: After re-reading this, I hope I don't come off as being some pompous asshole. I still have stresses and problems in my life, but I wanted to give those who had requested a good update to all the positives I've hit since making the change. Thanks again for all the positive feedback.**

Meaning, I had 5% more to do each day than I could reasonably get done. That extra 5% was left unfinished, and each day, my work load got heavier and I got more and more stressed. Some jobs were done quickly and poorly, and some just sat and grew worse and worse with each passing day.

Then the dam burst, reality came crashing down on my head, and I let go of responsibilities and wants and ideas that I couldn't and wouldn't ever be able to accomplish. I rediscovered myself and my desires, I stopped living to the expectations of other people, expectations that I myself had created. I discovered that my dream wasn't what I thought it was, and that I didn't want it anyway. I let go of doing it all. 

I let go of the 1/4 acre garden, accepted the fact that the weeds had turned it into a jungle, and that I had taken on too much. I sent the ducks to my mother, who has more room for them anyway. My dear friend fell in love with my hyper active dog, for which I didn't have the room, time, or money to take care of properly. I moved to a smaller house, leaving behind many of the items and ideas that I had accumulated. I got a part time job working with kids, and I'm started on the path to becoming a teacher.

I'm trying to focus now on the few important things, to do a little, but do it very well. I want to limit myself to 90% of what I can do. I don't want to take on more than I can handle.

The original idea was just to create a site where people can talk about what they want and what they're willing to give up for it, anonymously. I guess it turned into something a bit more now, with all the business of life, we all too often take some things for granted, like a friend, a mother, a meal, and forget that those are the exact things people elsewhere in the world are wishing for.

We all have this facebook friend, right? People you genuinely love and admire. People you like hanging out with. People you invite to your birthday parties. You know. Actual friends. Until you’ve clicked links exactly like this again and again and again. For YEARS. And all of a sudden, you start to wonder if this is some elaborate hoax, if you’ve actually just been reading the same article over and over.

It’s not like I have anything against happiness, or success, or meditation, or yoga, or being nice, or smiling more, or eating healthy, or losing weight, or being your best you, or embracing the day with a positive attitude. Those all sound great. Honestly, they do. And there are some really smart, simple truths to be found in all of those articles. There truly are.

It’s just that I have a problem with being told to do all of those things by skinny blonde ladies laughing on a beach wearing yoga pants.""

I lol'd.. hard.. this more or less makes fun of 9/10ths of the shitty blogs being written on simple living today. I'd love to see one where the author discusses their personal experiences rather than trying to educate me on the obvious. 

Simple living doesn't require a 12 point checklist. Blogs needing content require a 12 point checklist, and it gets posted on /r/simpleliving to drive up site traffic. 

A few examples:

Are you kidding me? Blogspam..

No shit..... nothing new here..


Does anyone else feel like simple living, the idea, is being co-opted by a bunch of mush mouthed bloggers and self-help wannabe gurus? Maybe I'm reading all the wrong blogs, maybe I just hate reading blogs, once I tried doing my own blog but thankfully someone told me I'm a sorry assed blogger, which prompted me to go back to watching videos of cats on youtube.

We are too damn busy.,135,24,104,http://www.reddit.com/r/simpleliving/comments/18a8pb/permission_to_rant_for_a_moment_we_are_too_damn/,"I've had these thoughts for so long, but it hit me like a freight train today.  I am a college student, and not lazy in any sense of the word; despite struggling with some mental health issues, I've kept myself mostly on track.  I even know what I want to do, and have a passion for it.

The problem?  I'm just too busy.  And for what?  I spend sixty hour weeks working on school to either work far too hard at an entry level job or spent eighty/week in grad school.  And again, for what?  So I can buy a house, be traditional, fulfil societies expectations of me?

Correct me if I'm wrong, but life shouldn't be living to work.  Life should be chasing your dreams, prioritizing.  We only live here once; we only get one chance at this crazy thing.  And I enjoy time spent with my loved ones, hiking, long walks, meditation, games with friends, writing, reading, seeking knowledge, taking a month to digest a deep book, rather than banging it and a report out in a week.

I don't see this life as good for me, or anyone.  Maybe it hits me harder because of my health issues; and I'm glad.  I'm glad I can't maintain this rate of pace.  Don't me wrong; there is a time and a place to work hard, and I am no stranger to it.  But that's not an enjoyable life.

The question is, what else do you do?  Where can one go and pursue a skill they absolutely love to make enough cash to live (and I'm talking far less than one might expect; we spend way too much money), and a society that supports these ideas?  Yes, I think adults in their thirties should spend a lot more time with their friends and family, not cramming in more work.

That makes them not any less nice people of course. They just have different priorities.

Anyway I would like to know how you think about this. Are you living a simple life even though you make good money? Are many people glorifying simple living because they dont want to work much and therefore have no choice? Would you still live the same life even if you would have more money without having more work?

Background: My wife and me live a simple life because it just feels right for us. We run our own business and make about 15k / month but spend only 2k (big part of it on organic food besides rent). We dont own a car even though we live on the countryside and bike or walk everywhere (we enjoy this also in shitty weather), local farmers deliver our veggies. I guess thats simple living, even though we still push our business forward. 

A friend of mine is a simple living lawyer. All other partners in his law firm drive fancy cars he only owns a bike and bikes to work every day for 40 minutes. He is a strict vegan and Zen Buddhist too and has no idea how to spend his money so he donates about half of it.

To purchase freedom from employment and time to pursue my dreams.",115,7,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/simpleliving/comments/j2rqm/im_thinking_about_moving_to_a_lowcost/,"I hold a totally decent, secure job right now. I make around $35,000 per year. I have a car, an apartment to myself, and enough extra money to do whatever I want, within reason. I don't have a lot of debt; just some student loans.

And supposedly, I'm living the American Dream. I wake up every morning, drive to work, sit in my cushy chair at my comfortable desk job, and then drive home. And this has been my daily existence for the three years since I graduated college.

Now, I'm sure many people would love to have what I have. But I don't.

I'm squandering my time and my youth. I don't like that I spend most of the day toiling on someone else's goals while my own dreams wither from neglect. My job, even as comfortable as it is, drains my energy and leaves me precious little time to work on the hobbies I care about, like building houses for Habitat for Humanity. And making games (I recently published one on the app store, but I don't have much time/energy to make others with everything else I have going on). And writing/researching about things I care about, and reading and learning, and a dozen other things.

But I give forty hours a week to my job. When I include the commute and mandatory lunch hour, my employee-life consumes 40-50% of my waking life on a weekly basis, and more than it's fair share of energy. So, like everyone else, I have to carefully discriminate where my personal time goes, and I'm neglecting far more hobbies and interests than I'd like.

So. I don't think I want a job any more. I don't want to be an employee. 

I am, therefore, thinking about reducing what I spend to such an extreme that I don't need a full time job. I can work rarely and independently to collect my low annual budget, and otherwise spend all that time just living. I could spend the rest of my youth reading, learning, playing, and working on my own projects that I care about ... instead of sitting in someone else's office. 

So, a few nights ago I wrote a program that analyzes my bank statements for the last year and breaks down what I've been spending. (I pay for everything using my check card, so it's easy to see what I've been paying for.) And over the last couple nights I've calculated exactly what I could cut in order to bring down my annual budget to $12,000. It would involve selling my car, moving to a new area, getting roommates, cooking lots of my own food, and living simply. By my poverty and simplicity, I purchase time. Time to pursue my own dreams and goals and life.

So, with that entire thought in mind, I'm curious for r/simpleliving's advice and commentary, including:

1. What might be a solid resource for searching for bike-friendly, low-cost cities? Any personal recommendations?
2. What about finding roommates? Any resources for finding like-minded individuals?
3. Play the devil's advocate. Why *shouldn't* I do this?",,False,,t5_2r0za,True,,,True,t3_j2rqm,http://www.reddit.com/r/simpleliving/comments/j2rqm/im_thinking_about_moving_to_a_lowcost/,

I chose Thoreau because his writing first introduced me to the entire concept of Simple Living. He's also a bit of an inspiration to me because once upon a time when I was being a weird little shit of a 14 year old, my grandmother told me, ""You don't live in a time or place where your sort of eccentricities will ever be appreciated. Maybe when Thoreau was alive, but not now."" 

I never really understood what she meant by that until I read Walden. I've hit my late 30s and now I realize that in some ways I am somewhat eccentric, which turned out fine for me. My few friends accept me as that strange friend of theirs that they've known all their lives and just accept that I'm different. 

They buy big houses, I'm living in a hovel in China. They have two cars, I ride a bike (if it hasn't been stolen, I'll check later). They have wives, kids, and a full time job; I'm single and looking forward to doing what Thoreau loved to do. That is talk a long walk and enjoy being able to do so just for the sake of doing so, I specifically plan to try to walk down the Oregon coast from Portland to the California border. Once that's finish I'll be moving on to visit Ecuador via bus and train and donkey cart all through Mexico and beyond. 

So Thoreau struck a note with me, what grabbed your attention in terms of writing, art, or architecture?

Right now they have goats and chickens, a large garden, solar power and hydro power... The original one room cabin is now an extra structure and it's where my fiance and I will be staying. 


I've visited many times, but I've never stayed longer than a week or two, so I'm looking for any general advice about adjusting to a simpler way of life all at once. Mostly though, I'm wondering if you guys have any advice about a potential power problem. My fiance relies on his desktop computer for work so we will be bringing it. We don't want to totally tax their power system so I'm wondering what are our options exactly to increase the power available? Is it reasonable to use a generator? Install extra solar panels? I am very unfamiliar with all of this. I anticipate more conversation with my family soon, but thought I'd also post here for any help that may come my way. Thanks!

Is there a way to either work while traveling or live so cheap/free you don't need to work?

One idea is to get the my walking life sponsored by some organization with a goal like 'donate to neurology research' or to start a blog/vlog and get money from ads. ...And/or play music in streets to earn money. I produce electronic music and wish to learn to play a hardware synthesizer, so it's probably something I'd do if I choose this kind of life anyways.

**EDIT:** Don't know if this matters but, alternative methods of travelling works too kinda. If I don't feel like walking it'd be nice to afford the luxury of taking the bus. I also bike on average every day when it's summer, so that's an option too. But I don't like the idea of that too much because of hills and because of the fact that I can't put my bike aside and choose to walk. I have to carry my bike with me.

They eventually end up polluting our waterways. Simple vinegar and hydrogen peroxide (oxygen bleach) will do for most cleaning jobs.

This is what Natural Home magazine (Jan 2002) had to say about this low cost, non-toxic cleaning method:

“By itself, vinegar is not a disinfectant, but when used with hydrogen peroxide, it kills bacteria more effectively than any commercial cleaner. 

Susan Sumner, a food scientist at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (VPI) in Blacksburg, Virginia, published the following formula in Science News. 

Purchase a bottle of 3 percent hydrogen peroxide and a bottle of plain white or apple cider vinegar. Pour each liquid into its own spray bottle. Spritz the item to be disinfected with both the vinegar and the hydrogen peroxide, then rinse with water.

 Using one mist right after the other is ten times more effective than each spray by itself and more effective than mixing the vinegar and hydrogen peroxide in one spray bottle. 

Tests at VPI found the two sprays used together killed virtually all Salmonella, Shigella, or E. coli bacteria on heavily contaminated food and surfaces; this spray combination is more effective than chlorine bleach. 

It doesn’t matter if you spray with the vinegar first, then the hydrogen peroxide, or vice versa. There is no lingering taste of vinegar or hydrogen peroxide, and neither is toxic if any reside remains. 

This combination works exceptionally well for sanitizing counters and other food preparation surfaces, including wood cutting boards.” ",,False,,t5_2r0za,False,,,True,t3_uhshx,http://www.reddit.com/r/simpleliving/comments/uhshx/vinegar_when_combined_with_hydrogen_peroxide_is/,

Instead, I spend money on education an supporting other causes in which I believe.

I think that the most important thing in life are the relationships that you have with your parents, children, brothers, sisters, the rest of your family and friend. That you should value, and that is what really brings happines and meaning to life.

I once read a book that said; ""Picture yourself being welthy and having lots of lots of money. Do you see yourself by yourself or with family and friends?"".

I love just about everything within my house. You can say/think what you want, but this is my *living space*, so please respect it. I also know the pictures make my house look **extremely** cluttered, but IRL it looks okay. 

On to the post. I guess I talk about my place a lot and a few people have asked me for some pics. Here you go. 

My house is a rectangle. You walk into the kitchen and that opens up into the living space. The bathroom is on the other side of the kitchen wall. This place is 250ft^2. I will answer any questions, so feel free to ask.

**Kitchen**

Small as fuck. Small stove, small sink, small frige. Six upper cabinets. Four drawers and one cabinet under the sink. I had to take off the door to one of the cabinets to fit a microwave there. I dry my dishes on top of the fridge or on the dog food container. There is a lot of storage space above the upper cabinets.

*Cost*

Shoe rack was found. Shelving was bought at Ikea for $1.50. Knife rack was Ikea. Microwave was Goodwill.

*Future Upgrades*

Cans and jars that match! A glass soap dispenser since I make all my soap at home with castile.

**Main Room**

My desk. SO's desk. Futon. Bench. Dog stuff. TV.

[coats and dog area](http://i.imgur.com/GvJ8n.jpg). I know that's a lot of dog toys but Brown Dog's old owner never let her have toys or treats or love so I'm overcompensating. I'm a sucker for her giant brown eyes.

*Cost*

Futon was $20 at a local thrift store!!! It's so soft and comfy. SO's desk was $20 from the same thrift store. Rug was found. (all 'found' things come from my building's recycling room. People just put their old stuff in there I usually get first dibs because I live across the hall from the recycling room. Muahaha) Milk crates were found. This type of shelving was something that I always wanted. I love the look. My desk is from Craigslist - $20 delivered. Bench and SO's chair are from Goodwill. My chair was found on the side of the road &gt;_&gt; TV cabinet was a dumpster dive find (my fist and only. I'm so proud) 

**Bathroom**

It's so big and spacious. I don't get it. I store all of our 'seasonal' (aka hats, gloves, scarves, etc) in a milk crate beside the dresser.

*Cost* 

Uhm, dresser was found in the recycling room. 

I also have a storage unit that is roughly 3'x7' on site. It houses two plastic totes full of blankets, stuffed animals and school books. My bike. The TV's box. My old desk chair and a space heater.

**EDIT** We pay $575/month and my place is within 15 blocks of downtown.

The only downside is that my SO is a night owl and I like to sleep when it's dark outside. We sometimes butt heads but we came to a compromise: I'll let him have his desk light on if he wears headphones or has the volume on the tv low/turns subtitles on.

I don't think I will be buying another car, just relying on my bicycle and public transportation (I live in Phoenix, AZ which is a pretty spread out city).

Plus all manner of books, cameras, terrariums, maps, and other things related to more minor hobbies.

Worth it?,77,23,63,http://www.reddit.com/r/simpleliving/comments/180jn8/quit_desk_job_to_simplify_life_now_30k_in_debt_to/,"From the outside, my life was on the right track. Fresh out of university I landed a promising full-time position in the financial district. After a couple years I had already paid off my student debt and even started a decent savings account. Major promotion opportunities where in my near future and I was well on my way to becoming one of those corporate wonder-women with a swanky downtown condo filled with nice things. 

But once I saw it all there in front of me, waiting to be consumed, I lost interest. 

I started feeling trapped by my office window. Growing old in a suit and killer heels was no longer glamorous. Like the rose from Beauty and the Beast, I could see my life slowly wilting away. I started living for the weekends, and not in a healthy way. Eventually I would become seriously depressed. 

It didn't take long before I needed a major change, a chance to get out of the rut I had created around myself and re-evaluate my life goals. So, to protest my mundane lifestyle I quit my job and went back to school to study fine arts. Most of my friends and family thought I was crazy, one called me brave, but I knew it was the right decision.

Until now. I do not regret this decision. I am following my passion and that is a wonderful thing. 

Throwing my consumption-based lifestyle to the curb is something I am still proud of, but faced with over $30k in student debt I have broken the golden rule, [don't buy shit you can't afford](http://vimeo.com/36988309). 

It was easy enough to justify my growing debt while in school, the experience, knowledge and contacts gained would be priceless... right? Now I just feel crushed by it all and this time I don't have that cushy office payroll to fall back on. I might be free from the chains of the corporate desk but I just replaced it with student debt. What is it that I'm feeling? Buyers regret??

**TL;DR** Quit high paying job to appease spirit and strive for the simple life. Ended up with looming student debt and a future of financial insecurity. 

**Edit:** Clarity. **This is a rant** and by no means a perfect argument.

We make cheese and sell it to shareholders through a local co-op as well as at a farmer's market. We also have a large garden that supplies most of our fresh vegetables. There's an opportunity to volunteer at the co-op too on your days off, which can be a lot of fun.   

Some of your duties would be learning how to herd the goats out into the surrounding forested canyons and BLM land, making all kinds of yummy cheeses, and tending to the garden.  

We are all really into food here, so expect to eat awesome meals.  If you love to cook, you'll do very well here!  

There is one full-time person here, as well as two wwoofers that are here for the season (I am one of them).  We are 27 and 30 years old, and the full-time person is a super awesome 61 year old lady who works harder than all of us put together.  Someone just recently left, and we need one more person to balance out the work load.    

The requirements are 20-25 hours a week, and there is a small stipend offered.  Most of the chores are completed in the morning, and we have a huge chunk of the day to ourselves to read, write, hike, relax.  

There is wireless internet that is run off of solar panels, so you won't be completely out of touch!  You could stay in the yurt, or sleep in a tent; it's up to you!  You could even sleep outside in just your sleeping bag.   

Thanks for reading!

**EDIT**

Thanks everyone for your interest!  I am really amazed by the amount of replies and people who want to come out here!  It feels good to know that there are so many people interested in this sort of lifestyle.

Fortunately, (or maybe not so fortunately for some of you) I think that we've found someone.  If it ends up not working out, you can count on me trying to contact those of you who said you could volunteer this summer!  I wish we could invite all of you out here, but that might get a little crazy.

What do I think simple living is? There is a quote from Ramit Sethi on frugality I think applies extremely well for simple living.
&gt;“Frugality isn’t about cutting your spending on everything. That approach wouldn't last two days. Frugality, quite simply, is about choosing the things you love enough to spend extravagantly on—and then cutting costs mercilessly on the things you don't love.”

So, what do I love? I love spending time with friends, climbing, making things with my hands, and a good beer. Drinking good homebrew beer with friends on top of a mountain we just climbed? Nirvana. 

I think the difference between cheap simplicity and frugal simplicity is discretion about where you make your cuts. Instead of asking ""can I do without this?"", ask ""Will my life be simpler living without it?"".

I see many posts here about minimal square-footed living spaces, removing unneeded gadgets from people's lives, getting rid of a car for transportation and whatnot. My response to many of these are ""Didn't you just make your life harder in the name of living more simply?""

Would ditching a car make my life simpler? It introduces extra stress to coordinate ones live around public transportation which is spotty at best where I live. I bike to work when the weather is nice, but I don't stress out and rather drive when it isn't. Without a car, I would need to bum rides to the nearest climbing locations and further trips would be completely out of the question.

I just started renting a 1325 sq. ft. house with my girlfriend. Its small enough to manage, the yard-work and snow shoveling is taken care of by the HOA, I have a garage, and an unfinished basement. Could it be smaller? Yes. However, I brew beer and host my friends on a regular basis so it fits all my criteria. If my girlfriend and I get married and have a kid, it has a spare bedroom we are currently using for an office.
I have a pretty strict ""If I haven't used an item in the past year, get rid of it"" policy which applies to just about everything (even books, which I give to my sister). I try to make everything as simple as possible, but not simpler. 

**TL;DR - Do what you love, remove things that you don't love, and don't introduce stress trying to live simply.**

Walking for only a few minutes could get me anywhere I needed to go, and on top of that they had the trolley. 

Unfortunately I don't think I could live in a place that gets that humid during the summer or risk living that close to sea level.

Does anyone here know of some good cities I could look into that are very accommodating to someone that doesn't have a car? I've been trying to eliminate as much from my life as I can, I find the hassle of owning a car not worth the benefit. I currently have one but when I graduate I plan to sell it and perhaps get a nice motorcycle for simplicity. So somewhere it doesn't snow that much would be great.  

Any advice would be most welcomed.

That is 47 days of carefully recording how much money I spend everyday, how much fruit I eat, my urges to drink cola, and my urges to eat sweets. I started doing this to develop the cornerstone habits of frugality, good diet, and losing weight. What brought this on was 47 days ago I got sick and tired of feeling tired all the time and being out of shape. 

47 days ago I vowed to go 30 days with no cola, no sweets, and spending no more than 250 dollars a month on personal expenses. Day 30 came and went and I decided to go right for day 60. I'm celebrating today because one of my coworkers tried to hand feed me chocolate. Apparently being the office white fat guy in a building full of Chinese women means getting chocolate forcibly shoved into your mouth. I thanked her nicely but politely refused, which surprised her and it led to a long conversation about my goals. 

I showed her my record sheets and she, Laura.. her English name, not sure what her Chinese name is, decided to give my scheme a try as well. I cautioned her to keep her goals simple. You can't effect change by making it too complicated to work through. From day 30 to 40 I really struggled with this and I finally just said to hell with it and cut out a few of the goals I added to my plan at day 30. It was a quest to get back to the simplicity of eating properly and not spending my money like a drunken sailor that carried me from day one to day thirty. 

My camera is missing, probably hiding under the sofa or something, which means I won't be posting pictures of my records sheets tonight. I will when I hit day sixty. Some might question the validity of asserting that living simple and holding goals for yourself and recording the results goes hand in hand. However, I think if you keep it simple, you have a means of organizing your habits to reduce the stress they give you.

Being overweight and nearly diabetic is giving me stress. Having high blood pressure and always being broke was giving me stress. I've lost weight, my blood pressure has dropped, and my bank account is starting to look decent after the last 47 days. Having a few goals that are achievable gives you the road map to living a simple existence and while you might not immediately be there, anything worth having is also worth working for.

Choose goals that are not out of your reach, you'll piss yourself off later when you fail. Don't choose goals that are too easy for you as well. Do keep in mind though, it might be easy on day 1 to 10, but come day 11 things start feeling like you piano on your back. So while it might seem easy at the beginning, it can be a real ballache later on. Keep it in mind when you write you goals out. I recorded all the results because it is deeply satisfying to me to see the days add up and up on my weekly planners. 

It gives me something tangible to look at and feel good about when I'm having one of those craptastic days. By writing down all the urges to eat poorly and drink cola I have gotten a better handle on the emotions that surround my poor choices. It also gave me an insight into my impulsive nature in terms of my lack of frugality. A frugality that I've much improved since I've begun this by starting to write shopping lists and asking careful questions of myself when I'm about to purchase something. 

I highly encourage writing goals and recording the results, it really is worth your time.

I take the terminology passive and productive from context of  English as a Second Language Teaching theory. Passive being listening and reading and productive being speaking and writing. Ideally you need a balance of all four to become successful in being a well rounded student. Why has our entertainment sources become so lopsided towards passive entertainment?

I'm curious about this because I did an inventory of sorts as to how my time is being spent on what sort of entertainment. I found myself watching so much tv that I was a bit surprised. Not that I think watching TV is bad, but it certainly doesn't require an expenditure of brain power. 

Is there some sort of deliberate design by marketing executives to turn us into passive lump who live to gobble up a whatever is beamed into our TVs and computers?

I don't think it is a deliberate plot or movement as much as it is a tendency to go where the money can be found. Hollywood makes its money off its movies and TV shows. It doesn't make a profit encouraging people to entertain themselves with gardening or baking their own bread.

Just sort of typing this out as it comes to my mind.

So essentially it's broken down into three sheets:

Budget
Inventory
Consumables
Fairly self explanatory I guess. Most of the 'Budget' sheet is formulas (I multiply my totals by 1.3 for good measure, 30% usually covers fluctuations or the unexpected). You can put in your budgeted monthly costs in the expenditures as well as the numbers it pulls from the other sheets.

The 'Inventory' and the 'Consumables' are a little more fancy. Though they're essentially a glorified list. There are columns for weight, cost, four sets of dates, lifecycle and monthly cost. Each time you buy/renew a new item, put the date down and repeat in each subsequent column until those dates are full. Now (though I do this part manually) fingers crossed the spreadsheet should do the next part for you - which is calculating the three time differences and averaging them so you have a vague lifecycle. The last column divides this number so you can see how much that is per month.

From there - use it regularly - add things as and when you buy them. I have a red sticker on my bank card to remind me to update the document after I make new purchases. It's a pain at first but you do it less and less as the document gets more complete. Obviously it doesn't take long to work out groceries &amp; consumables and some of the life cycles you can work out yourself (like how often you should buy a new toothbrush etc). Eventually it's really useful for things like clothes or electronics. Not to mention it can also be used as a record for insurance purposes or a clear list to help you de-clutter.",,False,,t5_2r0za,1360510995.0,,,True,t3_188so3,http://www.reddit.com/r/simpleliving/comments/188so3/so_i_threw_together_a_blank_version_of_the/,

At one time, we might have been able to a savor a bowl of macaroni and cheese, accompanied by a glass of milk., but after living in luxury for a few months we might find the macaroni no longers appeals to our discriminating palate; we might start rejecting it in favor of fettucine Alfredo, accompanied by a particular brand of bottled water. And not long after that, we might, if we can afford to do so, reject even this meal in favor of, say, risotto with Maine sweet shrimp and just-picked squash blossoms, accompanied by a bottle of that Riesling the critics have been raving about, and preceded, of course, by a nice salad of baby frisée, topped with braised artichokes, fava beans, Valencay cheese, baby asparagus, and confit cherry tomatoes.

When, as the result of being exposed to luxurious living, people become hard to please, a curious thing happens. Rather than mourning the loss of their ability to enjoy simple things, they take pride in their newly gained ïnability to enjoy anything but ""the best."" The Stoics, however, would pity these individuals. They would point out that by undermining their ability to enjoy simple, easily obtainable things---bowls of macaroni and cheese, for example---these individuals have seriously impaired their ability to enjoy life.

I know there are super healthy vegans out there and I also know there are super healthy people out there who eat the paleo diet. I have briefly experimented with both. But throughout my research I came to the conclusion there is no right diet, the person simply adapts to how ever they eat if they stick to it for long enough. Now I know if I went on a junk food binge, I would probably be thrown way outa whack because my body isnt used to it unlike the high majority of society which has adapted to that way of eating, but it also kills them slowly

* Only organic vegetables and fruits, either raw or steamed
* No spices, no onion, no garlic or other ""tasty"" vegetables

I did fasting in the past but this is different. It is very interesting to experience different food in a natural way. You start to think how we like to overstimulate our taste buds with all those flavors. I guess my usual craving for salt will be also less after this week.

This is just an idea and of course you can come up with your own rules. I enjoy this little challenge, even though it gets tough sometimes (still having this tasty homemade pesto in the fridge doesnt help either but yeah...)

My story:  
In my early 20's I was a very anxious and depressed person. Since I was 19 I have always had a good job, making good money and because of that- a lot of possessions that were really just crap I ended up storing. Getting rid of things caused some anxiety. It was so bad that I would go through a two day depression after just rearranging my room. I had an attachment to “stuff” and this arrangement of my stuff just was not familiar, and stress-inducing. This was a sign, but I didn't quite realize the significance of it back then. I also hated cleaning and realized that I was cleaning a lot, dusting and other stuff. Don't get me wrong- I like clean and organized. I just didn't want to put a lot of time into it. I found that the more crap I had, the more I was doing it. The more things I had, the more places things needed to be put and the more things needed to be dusted.

In addition, I was (and still am) not rooted in any one particular place. I haven't lived anywhere longer than three years for the last 12. But I hated moving all my stuff.  

I think I started to realize that the less stuff I had, the less anxious I felt. I moved myself to a college town to finish a degree at 25. I didn't have a lot while I was there, and it was a very liberating feeling. I felt so good. I graduated at 28 and sold my entire apartment. That felt great.

I wouldn't say it was a switch that flipped in me, but over time I started finding out the less stuff I had, the more relief I felt. From that point forward, it was a process of detaching from that stuff. I collected movies, books, computer equipment. All of which would be touched once, then never again. I have since sold all movies, books, and rid of all the computer crap I had.  

I can now fit almost everything I own into a large backpack. Though I still have more work to do and am excited to do it. Some things on the list are sell my motorcycle (I still have a car and mountain bike that I will keep), and organize/minimize my digital life (or just make it more efficient- moving more stuff to cloud-based storage).  

tl;dr: It wasn't a switch, but a realization that I had an unhealthy attachment to stuff which was contributing to my anxiety, and a process of letting go of it.",,False,,t5_2r0za,False,,,True,t3_pq6f0,http://www.reddit.com/r/simpleliving/comments/pq6f0/what_made_you_choose_to_simplifydownsize/,

When I come back from Holland, I'm going to live with a friend for a while (this is already confirmed) until I can afford a van, then I'll get a mattress and sleep in the back of the van at my work, (also already confirmed), where I have a shower and a fridge and microwave. I will live there for as long as I like, and save up money until I have enough for a small apartment and some (minimal) furniture and a few appliances.

Property is astronomically expensive where I live, so buying land and living off grid isn't an option.


What are your thoughts on this? I also fully acknowledge I come from priviledge in the sense that I am vandwelling by choice, and I understand many people are forced to vandwell due to finincial circumstances. I'm not intending any judgements, just trying to live a little lighter. Thanks!

So now what? I'm used to focusing on an ongoing list of tasks and errands, whether it be completing them or avoiding them. But my fridge is full, my apartment is tidy, my paperwork is in order. 

Sure, there are things I COULD be doing, like exploring my city or socializing, but those aren't things one can do all the time. I can't be on the go every waking hour. I could be cleaning, but I only need to reach a certain level of obsession there before there's nothing left to clean. There are errands I could run, but those aren't things I NEED to buy, and I know they're only a consideration because I don't have anything else to fill the gap with. I have no creative spark that would fuel me to write or draw or do anything of that sort, and I can't seem to gather the attention span to slip into a good book. 

I feel like I'm searching for things to add to my to-do list, but there's nothing left to do. It feels like I've put in this work to simplify my life.... and now that it's simpler, the only way to prevent bordeom is to fill that simplicity with another commitment. I'm so used to working from a list that everything I do feels like I'm doing it for the purpose of finishing it rather than enjoying it.

I am full of energy, able to wake up earlier in the morning, enjoying food even more, and best of all my skin finally cleared up after a solid year of breakouts. I have been watching how much fruit I eat to a certain extent, but I haven't even really had the desire to pig out on it. Only fresh fruit too, no dried fruits or dates. I had an apple with lemon juice today and it seriously tasted like bubble gum. 

I should mention- we re-introduced meat (organic/grass fed) into our diet this past week, have been drinking raw milk from our new goats every day, and taking a few supplements (fish oil, Spirulina, daily multivitamin, B complex). So those are definitely a big part of these changes as well. 

I have ""cheated"" once so far, but if you fainted from heat exhaustion I dont think you would turn down a  bite of a cookie either, haha. It actually didn't make me feel any better, though. I also decided not to throw away my jar of vegenaise or mustard. We'll just use them til they are done and then not buy more.


Anyway, I am not going to be spamming you all with weekly updates for 6 months or anything, but so far this change in my diet is definitely helping me focus on the moment and enjoy the ""simple things"" even more so I think it fits in with this sub quite nicely :)

So I have to move off campus by noon tomorrow (Friday 12/21). So I had an apartment lined up for tomorrow but turns out he ""forgot"" that will be returning until ""middle of January"". So I am going to be homeless (aka living in the med school lectures halls/library with a bug-out bag). I have my entire worldly possessions with me. What do I get rid of?

**12/25 UPDATE:**

so first I should elaborate more on the above, I was a tad bit inebriated when I wrote this post originally. I withdrew from university in the beginning of the semester, and received an email on a Wednesday night informing me that I MUST vacate the premises by the next day at 5pm. I went to speak with the manager in the quad office, who was my former boss before I was diagnosed with CRPS/RSD. She said that there was nothing she could do and if I wasn't out of there by 5pm they would arrest me for trespassing. I never thought in a million years these words would come out of my mouth:

*""Then they can arrest me. I'd rather be arrested than ruin an $80,000 surgery."" I have a chronic nerve pain disease (CRPS/RSD) that took up residence in both of my knees. For the past ~2 years I had to use a medical scooter to get around, and wasn't able to walk more than a few steps or stand for more than a minute or so. On November 14th, I had a [spinal cord stimulator] (http://imgur.com/a/FB5vC#0) implanted that changed my life. I've been able to walk 100% of the time, retiring my scooter (hopefully for good). There are of course times that I need to limit bending down, walking for long periods of time but I'm mostly back.*

So the night that I posted, one of my best friends came over to comfort me and try and calm me down. She found two craigslist ads for places and made me call both of them. Admittedly, I was best friends with my Jager bottle, so I don't really remember what happened in the conversations. The first one was just fucking creepy calling me ""sweetie"" and saying ""nighty night"". The second one we agreed to stop by in the afternoon on Friday to come see it. Friday morning I went to the quad office and my old boss wasn't there but her boss who knew me was there. I explained what happened and she paused, then said ""that's fine, do what you have to do"". love that woman. didn't always see eye to eye but she knows what I've been through in my life so I think she sensed that I was really at the end of my rope. 

So we go to see the place later, it's a decent house (5br/2ba) with a bunch of college guys living in it. Room is pretty decent as is everything else, just needs cleaning. For $520 it was in my budget, and not too bad for NY standards. He says he just needs to confirm with the guys but assures me it will probably be fine. Friend and I head off to Wal-Mart to pick up an airbed and a few other things. I'm getting nervous since it's been 5 hours at this poin so I call him. Said one of the guys wanted to speak to me, and apologized that he hadn't called yet and he would speak to him right now. Get a call from other roommate. Asked if I had any questions, etc. I had forgotten to ask about utilities, and if they were included. Says no, it's $100 EXTRA PER PERSON PER MONTH. I asked if I could call him in a few because I had bad reception. I'm standing in the middle of Wal-Mart trying so hard not to have a public meltdown. 

So friend and I go back to campus apartment and I just start throwing shit out. I then receive this text message.

**A: Hi, how are you? B had told me that we forgot to tell you utilities were separate. If you could give me a call tomorrow we might be able to see if we can work something out. Thank u and have a great night**

**Me: Hey yeah I'd definitely like to work something out if possible. I could do $550 total with utilities.**

**Me: I watch tv on my computer, and don't need a phone, I just use my gmail account or google voice**

**A: Do u think you'd be willing to do the dishes and some cleaning? I talked to the guys if u can we'll pay the rest of 
everything**

**Me: Yes that's definitely fair**

**A: Great, we can smooth out all of the details tomorrow. If you'd like to move things in I'll be back from work at 5**

**Me: Okay sounds good.**

The cleaning thing really didn't bother me, honestly I would've cleaned anyway. So apologies for the LONG update, but I am so grateful for everyone's responses!! &lt;3

**TL;DR: found another place, lost place, renegotiated with cleaning, moved in Saturday/Sunday. wee!**

AKA how to prep raw red cabbage so it's not so dang crunchy.,40,3,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/simpleliving/comments/wcc8s/spreading_the_gospel_of_raw_cabbage_aka_how_to/,"Cabbage is [amazingly healthy](http://www.whfoods.com/genpage.php?tname=foodspice&amp;dbid=19).  It's also cheap, delicious, and versatile.  Cooking it is great, but you lose some of the health benefits.  And, at least for me, raw red cabbage is so crunchy that my jaw starts getting tired after eating just a few bites.  So what to do?  Use salt to draw out the water!  It makes the cabbage soft, having the same texture as if it had been cooked, but it's still raw!  You can keep it in your fridge and then just put it in everything--make all your meals healthier.

Procedure:
Take your head of raw red cabbage.  Wash it and get rid of any cut or broken leaves on the outside.  Cut it in half, vertically (so you cut the stem/heart in half).  Cut out the heart from each half.  Cut the cabbage into cole slaw-sized bits.  Put the cabbage bits into a large colander, with a plate underneath.  Depending on the size of the cabbage, sprinkle 1-2 Tbsp of salt onto the cabbage.  Mix it all up with your hands, to make sure the salt is evenly distributed.  Cover it if you're afraid of bugs getting to it, and let the whole thing sit for at least two hours.

When you come back, you should see purple water pooled under the colander.  The salt pulls the water out of the cabbage, making it soft and pliable rather than stiff and crunchy.  Pour out the water, and rinse the cabbage well (unless you want it to be really salty).  Voila!

Keep it in the fridge.  I love this method of cabbage prep because I can use it to make quick, healthy meals for the next week or so.  I'll cook up a big pot of quinoa or brown rice and keep it in the fridge, too.  When I'm hungry I'll put some of the cabbage and rice in a bowl, add some black beans and spices (hot sauce/garlic powder/cumin is a favorite combination of mine), and have a really hearty, healthy meal ready in less than two minutes.  So cheap!  So healthy!  So delicious!

Would be very honored to help others do the same.,48,11,51,http://www.reddit.com/r/simpleliving/comments/pyk9q/i_have_successfully_paired_down_my_crap_to_only/,"This change was motivated by a couple months of very frequent moving (while holding down a job/life, so everything needed to come),  including a month in a hostel. I don't believe I could have done it without the Buddhist teachings of nonattachment that I try to follow. Please feel free to ask me more specific questions, or to tell me your story, and I will do my best to work with you!

EDIT: Since a few asked about how Buddhist teachings help me get rid of physical shit, I'll answer up here. First, meditative practice has helped my mindfulness on a daily, mundane basis - giving me the ability to remember to reevaluate every item I have whenever I touch it. I have a very ""there is no later"" mentality. This helps when I pick up a thing and go ""Do I *really* need and use this? No? Well I'll get rid of it *right now*"". I've noticed that without that *right now*, it doesn't happen. I keep a box in my room for give aways at all times. When it gets full I make a trip to a charity.

The second major way in which Buddhist teaching help me get rid of crap is with nonattachment. The ramifications of this teaching are vast, but I will do my best to summarize how they have affected me. When I want to get rid of a thing, I can now say ""ah, the time in which this thing and my life intersect has ended. So it goes!"" It no longer feels like something I need to grieve about. Also, I'm a lot better at not having my shit be a stub definition for my self. (What my self is is another question altogether...but that's beyond the scope of this post.) That is to say, I don't need to chase questions like ""should I keep this shirt because I'll look like a really cool punk in it?"" or whatever. I don't have fantasies about what lives my shit can create for me anymore. Instead I'm better able to look at what it ACTUALLY does. 

I hope that is understandable...let me know if not! I've never tried to put it into words before so maybe I've left something out or been unclear.",,False,,t5_2r0za,True,,,True,t3_pyk9q,http://www.reddit.com/r/simpleliving/comments/pyk9q/i_have_successfully_paired_down_my_crap_to_only/,

It didn't take me long to realize that these cravings were the direct result of the commercials I was being exposed to, and that they only seemed out of place because I had gone so long without watching TV.

This has lead me to believe that consumer culture (TV commercials in particular) is at the root of our country's ""obesity epidemic.""  For every hour of TV, people are exposed to several minutes of advertising messages prompting them to be hungry, to eat, to crave food whether they physiologically need it or not.

Brace yourselves.,44,4,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/simpleliving/comments/u8gch/requesting_advice_how_would_an_overwhelmed/,"I understand that this subreddit attempts to address a person's ""stuff, work, speed, and stress"" in order to help one live simply.  Guess I should break out my current scorecard in those areas.

**Work/Stress**

I'm an EMT.  My work life is mostly comprised of alarms, stressful calls, and working long and inconsistent hours.  For instance, I just finished a 24-hour shift yesterday, am currently pulling an overnight, and have a couple day shifts next week.  I see death weekly.  I frequently leave work mentally and physically drained.

My mother is ill and my family is depressed.

I'm studying for the MCATs in a month in order to get into medical school this year.

I sleep incredibly poorly on [this freaking lumpy thing](http://www.raymourflanigan.com/reno-full-klik-klak-with-storage-264277003.aspx) in my bedroom normally.  I sleep on floors and in ambulance seats, both very seldom, at work.

**Speed**

As above, my pace is typically frenetic while working.  When I'm not, it's the opposite.  I slow to a snail's pace.  I feel unproductive, because I've convinced myself I love just doing anything (read: nothing) with ""no alarms and no surprises.""  This reduces down to melting in front of a computer.  So I need to find a happy medium where I can still be productive.

**Stuff**

I lived in single-bedroom apartments for 5 years before finally landing a multiple-roommate situaiton for this past year.  Before I moved out of my last place, I threw away my couch, donated my dining set and all my chairs, sold my bed and coffee table, and got rid of a bookshelf.  I reduced my belongings enough to fit them all, albeit in a cramped fashion, into a single bedroom and rather large closet.  I'm proud of this, but I want to trim it down even more.

I have loads of papers from college that I want to keep, but not in their physical form.  I have a flatbed scanner, but it would take weeks scanning them with it, so I've been looking at document scanners.  At ~$300-400, I can't figure out if getting another expensive thing is worth it to get rid of a few boxes' worth of papers.  I have a tall bookshelf that's completely crammed with books that I keep because ""I might read them someday,"" but in reality, I've maybe pulled about a dozen off of it in the past year.

I try to give away clothes yearly, but it feels like the volume just doesn't go down.  My whole wardrobe of things I wear now can probably fit in about two standard laundry loads.  Add another two of things I don't, and things that are for other seasons.

I worked in IT for many years before EMS so I have two plastic, half-height cabinet units packed with various computer parts, cables, peripherals, and equipment I've garnered over time.  Again, I rarely grab stuff from them, but when I do, it's something very obscure and a pain to get online, which makes me nervous about chucking anything.

**Thoughts**

I've tried to postulate why I am where I am.  I'm sure people reading this might think depression, and you could be right, but I'm not sure if I'm living this way because I'm depressed, or if I'm depressed because I'm living this way.  I think it's the latter, so I'd like to fix it.  I'm usually a happy guy.

I see pictures on reddit of soldiers capturing all their belongings in a single photo and get jealous, but also a bit motivated.  I did quite a bit to get to a single bedroom of a 3-person apartment.  Now I'd like to go a little further.  Thanks for reading.

Would you load up a suitcase full of pictures and clothes? Would you stuff as many books as you could possibly manage into a box and lug it on your shoulders? Would you bring the bare essentials of a few toiletries, a change of clothes, and a hard drive with all of your pictures?

We seem to collect so much stuff in our lives, but what do we really need? When I go on vacation I try to bring as little as possible. When I’m there, I realize that I don’t miss anything that I left at home and could probably do without half of the things I brought along.

We don’t really need all of the things sitting in our closets, cabinets, boxes, and cars. You could lose everything you owned tomorrow and it wouldn’t matter. You would get over it. Sure you’d be sad about a few sentimental items. You’d miss your favorite shirt and pictures of your kids, but you’d go on.

If we don’t need any of this stuff, then why do we spend our whole lives collecting it? Why do we spend thousands of dollars a year on homes with extra closets, basements, and attics to store things that we don’t even look at?

Why do people get angry when they lose things? What does it matter?

The only thing that matters in your life is your experiences. What you do today is all that matters. If you enjoy yourself and are happy then you are on the right track. Why would you keep doing it if you hated what you were doing? Why do we sit in cubicles in stuffy offices so that we can make enough money to buy things?

Then we buy things and have nowhere to put them, so we need to buy a house to store our stuff. But the house you can afford is way out in the suburbs because you need that third bedroom and the two car garage to store your stuff. So now you need to buy a car to drive yourself from your suburban home to your job.

Well that car costs money, the house costs money, and all that stuff costs money. It costs so much, in fact, that you need to work harder to find a better job so that you can afford it more easily.

So now you are already working a job in a cubicle that you don’t like, but are sucking up to a boss that annoys you so that you can get a promotion to pay for all of the stuff that you couldn’t really afford in the first place.

All the while, you still have to make your mortgage payments and your car payments. Not to mention those student loan payments because you had to get that good education so that you could get that “good” job in the first place.

All of these things keep weighing on us as time goes on. The debt never quite seems to go away. Yet, the house keeps getting smaller as you keep filling it up with more stuff.

Somewhere along the way you maybe get married and have kids. With the extra people and all of that stuff, you’re completely out of space and have to buy a bigger house. You still haven’t paid off the first one, but manage to sell it at a small profit. You put that profit into the new house, but it still has a pretty big mortgage payment. The problem is that you had to move farther out into the suburbs to find a bigger house that you could afford, so you might as well buy a new car that gets better gas mileage. Oh and don’t forget the second car or minivan to take care of those kids.

Now you’ve just spent thousands more dollars moving all of your stuff into the new house and on down payments and of course new furniture because you need something nice for the new place. Well now you’re really strapped for money, but luckily all of that hard work paid off and you’ve become a manager with a higher paycheck. Unfortunately, now you’re even more busy and don’t get to see your kids as much because you’re working till eight every night, but at least you can afford to buy them new toys and send them to that expensive after school program.

But it doesn’t end there. Those toys take up space. They’re just more stuff. You keep acquiring more of that stuff. It’ll eventually lead to another house, maybe another promotion, and don’t forget saving for college.

Everything keeps piling up. Eventually you’re making three times more than what you were when you were making when you started out. If you’re lucky that is. But for some reason, you aren’t saving any of it. You always seem to be running paycheck to paycheck.

Your kids eventually graduate and leave for college or a job. Then you finally decide that it’s time to downsize your lifestyle. You move into a smaller house and get the smaller car. You sell some of your stuff, but it still clutters up your home. You want to travel more, but now you’re always busy with meetings because of your high paying job.

All of this keeps going on. It’s an endless cycle of making more money so you can spend more and more. Eventually you retire and things are okay. Maybe you even pay off your mortgage and own your home. All that hard work finally paid off now you want to travel, but now your health is going. All of that stress from the job has given you heart issues. Maybe your wife or husband is suffering from cancer.

You finally have all the time in the world to travel, but you’re both sick and don’t want to leave the house any more. You get better, your wife beats cancer, but now you’re in your 70s and are too tired to go anywhere. All the while your kids visit less and less. Your friends are starting to die off. Maybe you even lose your spouse.

Your house is still full of all of the stuff you’ve collected over the years. You have a basement and attic full of boxes of things you don’t even remember. Your kids grumble about who will have to clean it up when you die. You sit in your house all day waiting for one of your kids or grandkids to visit. You make sure your stuff is organized and clean so that anybody who visits will be impressed with your tidy home.

Then you really get sick. This time it’s for real. You lay there in the hospital with a nurse whose name you can’t remember. Your stuff is so far away from you. You don’t even remember 1/10th of it all. Maybe you do remember that you never saw the Great Wall of China or rode the Tube in London.

Maybe you even have some consciousness in the end and realize that you worked so hard your entire life to buy all of that stuff, but in the end it’s all just sitting in your house while you drift away in some hospital bed while your kids cry in the next room. You realize that you didn’t spend half of the time doing what you wanted to do because of all that stuff.

Then you die. The funeral is nice with lots of flowers. Most of the young kids don’t even know what’s going on. A few weeks later your kids take a few things from your house for sentimental reasons. They need to add to their stockpile of stuff.

Then they sell the rest of it or donate it to good will. They’ll probably just throw half of your stuff away. All of the stuff that you worked so hard to accumulate will be gone. You don’t get to take it with you. And the worst part is that it takes the most precious thing away from you.

Time.

**Short Form** : I have a lot of things I don't use (toys, video game consoles, video games, computers, monitors, clothes, instruments, boxes, assignments, trophies etc.etc.etc ). I have elaborate sentimental attachments to most of it and always get floored trying to think of where to start. Any suggestions.  
*****
**Long Form** : I have kept things and been a packrat because that is what I observe from family. They all have crates and chests of things we never touch. Grandmothers' old quilts and sweaters. Sentimental concepts from years gone by. Largely it was with introversion, I began to find more comfort in things than people. As I was bullied regularly through school with no real recourse short of shutting myself in my room with toys and old trophies to convince myself I had value.  
.  
Yeah, sob sob, anyways. So that's all a thing, ended in grade 8 (age 14 or so) I'm 23 now. I'm graduating college in 4 months, living common law with my girlfriend of 2 years, we've been living together for 18 months and things are, really going well. With counselling and help and new environments from moving for college, I've really changed a lot of who I am. But I still seem to attempt to define myself from old possessions.  
.  
I get hung up about old things, because now when people talk about 'oh when i was younger' I still just think, 'well I didn't have friends, I just had my toys.'. It's an immediate sense of worthlessness and so I feel any veritable worth is still only maintained in my possessions.  
.  
Worse being, I observe this, I see myself thinking it and just, try and read all these minimalist blogs or declutter articles and get so inspired, then I fall flat the second I open a box.  
I remember why I have the toys, why I kept the report cards, why I keep the doodles and notes to myself and I can't get rid of any of it.  

But like I said, I'm graduating college, all this crap is in my parents home and they're not in great health. I want to clear this out for them so if they need to move to a smaller place it's easier for them, it's just that extra bit they don't have to do. Also, it's for my own independence, I feel like it's using space as storage, I come home and I have no sense of productivity, I feel like I'm back to being a high school graduate with nothing to do and I hate it. I just sit surrounded by old comforts that are now old ghosts and can't even conceive getting rid of it.  
.  
I am constantly afraid that tossing any of it, if I ever want to go back, I won't be able to remember. I fear that all the positive memories I've tied to this junk is my safety net for when life might, possibly, but no guarantee, turn to crap.  
.  
I am moving into a 1 bedroom with my girlfriend in the coming months and the sense that I am moving on in life, I feel I shouldn't have all these things still. But they are being kept for when a 'shoe drops' and 'all hell breaks loose'. i.e. breakup, parents/family death, unemployment leading to homelessness (this shouldn't happen, I've never been late for rent in my life and managed it myself for 4 years, but the fear still sits there, as though I might become the most spontaneously incapable person for paying rent.)  
*****
.  
So, that was lengthy and reasonably above the community's pay grade :P. Thanks though, for any replies or comments, criticisms, suggestions, resources... all of that is great.  
.  
I am getting counselling to help with a lot of things that happened in the last year (Grandmother died, dad was given 2 years to live, sister was told she'll probably be bedridden for life, mom has fibro and arthritis and will just keep losing mobility, other sister had a good many pregnancy scares, though did eventually carry to term after having had 3 1st term 'miscarriages' [I think there's an actual term, not sure of it at this time.]).  
.  
But while counselling's been great for helping me clear my mind about it, it's also resulting in me seeing the problem of my clutter and I want to take the steps to clear it, correct it and be the first in my family to finally take action on reducing my possessions.  
As I write this, I'm staring at a box of transformers I haven't touched in ages, a slush puppie tall cup I've never used and a marionette I once played with when I was 14.  
Sorry for the length of the post, but I greatly appreciate any help, tips or direction. Thank you.  

**edit 1**: reading [this article (CNN)](http://articles.cnn.com/2009-01-20/living/rs.top.causes.of.clutter_1_clothes-obstacle-attic?_s=PM:LIVING) is helping with a few ideas. I'm still searching around and just trying to figure out how to get past what feels like this last barrier of having all this garbage.  
  
**edit 2**: WOW, So I go to bed and felt maybe there'd be a reply or an extra comment. But I come back to great suggestions. Incredibly valuable insight and tips on where and how to start. Any time I begin to expect some sort of mediocrity from reaching out for help on Reddit I'm blown away. Thank you to each individual person. Coming back here will definitely help keep me in line and I'll take some before and after photos in the meanwhile as I go through. Probably just for my own motivation at first. But I'll be able to show and feel that change is happening and want to be able to come back here and show what your suggestions helped motivate me towards.  
  
Thank you again, very much. Seeing encouragement is really helpful. I had a bit of discussion with my girlfriend about the topic/showed her this post and she's offered to be of any help she can. I've done my best to reply where able, upvotes to all you glorious embracers of simpler living. Also r/minimalism and r/simpleliving have been added to my main accounts subscriptions.

I am just looking for others thoughts or experiences with any of this.

I have always been a good swimmer and after some experience snorkeling in the reefs, I believe I could be a good free diver. I would like to find a cheap place to live in a tropical area and free dive for food. This would mean that I would use fish as my main source of food and purchase everything else from somewhere else.

I think I would still need to find a job that involves no more than 20 hours a week and I would plan on riding my bike everywhere, so an island is preferable.

How feasible is this and what are some tips any of you might have for this simple lifestyle?

My family came from the Soviet Union, and naturally were hoarders. (it used to be pretty hard to buy something simple like soap there.)

I used to really like toys and things in general when I was little. As I grew older, things started to appeal less and less to me.

Nowadays on my birthday people have a pretty hard time coming up with something for me, because I usually don't want any 'thing'. Sure, we can simply go to a restaurant to celebrate, but it's not really different from going to a restaurant on a normal day.

With regards to going out, at my work, people buy food from expensive places every day. Cooking 'takes too much time'.

I also have a hard time getting people gifts. Making something for someone is considered cheap. And someone being minimal wouldn't want to keep around that thing anyway.

Thinking further in the future, these days it's hard to find a nonmaterialist spouse. It is assumed by current culture norms that the wedding and ring will be this grand very expensive venture. I might get a lot of haters for this one but: To a small extent the girl would decide whether or not to marry based on the price of the ring. Do you really want to represent a whole marrage relationship with a ring?

My parents don't wear their rings - they love eachother and don't need a reminder of it. In their days, weddings were not so expensive, there were no honey moons. Giving an expensive wedding gift was thought off as show off wealth, so people didn't do it much.

But now everything seems to be different. It's horrible, but it's the world we live in. Going around it would be considered social suicide.

I love our technological process. Every year some new amazing things keep appearing. 3d printing, nanotechnology, wikipedia.. You name it.

But it seems, socially things are getting worse every time.

She's somewhat resistant to attempts to reduce the workload.  However, she just started working and I'm guessing that 40 hours per week of work will make it impossible for her to maintain the workload and it seems like an ideal time for reducing our workload.

I'd favor getting rid of or simplifying a lot of our things, but it's tough to get her on board with the abstract benefits of less.

Also, I've been doing my best to pick up around half the housework, but it feels like I'm just making the situation worse.  I've got much better things to do than spend 25 hours per week working on chores.  I tend to think of things from an efficiency standpoint - designing solutions to reduce the workload, make it quicker or possibly even eliminating the need to do it in the first place.

An example: I'm now responsible for picking up the bedroom.  This supposedly takes 15 minutes per day.  There's a ton of makeup/jewelry/misc clutter across our dresser which isn't visually appealing and is difficult to put away since none of it has a designated spot.  Her solution would be to leave it and try to make it look neat each day.  Mine would be to get rid of unused items, find an out of the way place for seldom used items and find an extremely handy yet not unsightly place for the items that get daily use.  A perfect example of the problem would be the decorative pillows and a couple random stuffed animals we have stuck on our bed.  Keep in mind that these have no sentimental value (the backstory behind both is really something she doesn't need or want to know).  So every single night we move these things off our bed and then put them back on.  I've been trying to get rid of them for ages now.  In my ideal world, I'd get rid of 90% of the stuff and spend less than 2 minutes picking up.  A world where her stuff was almost always neatly out of the way would be acceptable.

I'm just not sure how to get there - start tossing stuff?  My general descriptions and ideas of how to reduce the workload of the chores haven't been met with any enthusiasm or buy in.  Something tells me that I'm going about it the wrong way.  I'd just like to mention that despite our disagreement on the general idea of ""stuff"" it's all good-natured discussions and banter here, it's not to the point where it's bringing up some sort of resentment. 

Edit: I just want to point out that I'm aware that what we are doing is a huge time waster.  I'm full of ideas of ways to cut this all down to manageable, so more ideas aren't really helping.  The problem is that my wife refuses to acknowledge that there may be some sort of problem and resists giving up any of these responsibilities that clearly she'd be better without.  I need suggestions on how to social engineer this situation into something where we both spend a lot less time on this crap.

Edit2:  Just wanted to make clear that all time estimates are written as provided by my wife.  It wasn't really an exercise in logging time on chores (we aren't getting that scientific), it was just me making sure I was pulling my weight around the house as she starts her new job.",,False,,t5_2r0za,1363900003.0,,,True,t3_1aqsqw,http://www.reddit.com/r/simpleliving/comments/1aqsqw/we_spend_47_hours_a_week_on_chores/,

Most Americans say that they want simpler lifestyles more in line with their core values. Simplification is a leading trend of our times.

Sometimes it takes ""wake up calls"" (such as surviving a near-death experience, or losing a job) to re-evaluate our lives. These calls are a reminder...

that life is precious 

that we no longer have time for pettiness

that we have much to give and 

NOW is the time for doing what is important.

Surround yourself with beauty as you begin your quest to simplify your life. Begin paying more attention to aspects of everyday life that inspire you.

On your search for simple beauty, intuition simplifies your decision-making. Intuition is your sense of what is true or what is best to do. It will enable you to make better decisions that will enrich your life.

Support yourself as you start to make changes in your life. For example, try writing a journal to report your progress. Or exchange support with like-minded friends. - [source](http://www.cof.orst.edu/cof/extended/sustain/tchguide)

Urban living is not only cheaper and more convenient for the individual, but it also provides benefits for a society, such as less energy usage.

I see myself living in urban environments throughout my life, and while I admire the cabin type living, alone in the woods, functionally, not all of us can live this way.  Society as we know it would be extinguished.

Am I saying cookie cutter suburban houses and projects are the answer?  Absolutely not.  But with modern advancements, it is more than possible for one to grow an immense amount of food on such a small tract of land.  One could envision a city of such type places, small houses, well-cultivated gardens all around.

This is my dream.  What is more simple than being surrounded by fellow human beings?  I grant that alone time is needed, but as an extrovert, being cut off from social contact wears on me heavily.

Inside the small boat were several large yellowfin tuna. The businessman complimented the Mexican on the quality of his fish and asked how long it took to catch them. The Mexican replied only a little while.

The businessman then asked why he didn't stay out longer and catch more fish? The Mexican said he had enough to support his family's immediate needs. The businessman then asked, but what do you do with the rest of your time? The Mexican fisherman said, ""I sleep late, fish a little, play with my children, take a siesta with my wife, Maria, stroll into the village each evening where I sip wine and play guitar with my amigos; I have a full and busy life, señor.""


The businessman scoffed, ""I am a Harvard MBA and I could help you. You should spend more time fishing and with the proceeds buy a bigger boat. With the proceeds from the bigger boat you could buy several boats; eventually you would have a fleet of fishing boats. Instead of selling your catch to a middleman, you would sell directly to the processor and eventually open your own cannery. You would control the product, processing and distribution. You would need to leave this small coastal fishing village and move to Mexico City, then LA and eventually New York City where you would run your expanding enterprise.""


The Mexican fisherman asked, ""But señor, how long will this all take?"" To which the businessman replied, ""15-20 years."" ""But what then, señor?"" The businessman laughed and said, ""That's the best part! When the time is right you would announce an IPO and sell your company stock to the public and become very rich. You would make millions."" ""Millions, señor? Then what?"" The businessman said, ""Then you would retire. Move to a small coastal fishing village where you would sleep late, fish a little, play with your kids, take a siesta with your wife, stroll to the village in the evenings where you could sip wine and play your guitar with your amigos.""

My main concern is RSS. I managed to cut down most of my feeds and keep only those related to my field of study, but I still end up reading a bunch of articles I'm only marginally interested in.

The exact amount isn't set in stone, but could be anything from £10,000 - £30,000. Given the choice, I'd give up the money in a heartbeat if it meant that things were different, but I've come to see this as an opportunity and I suppose something of a silver lining.


My question is, what are my options for using this money to provide me with somewhere secure, legal and pretty rural to live? As a fledgling artist I'd love to find somewhere simple and relatively isolated to live and work, even if it's only for the summer months. The ultimate dream is to buy my own plot of land and build a small home on it to achieve some degree of self-sufficiency, but I'm happy to rough it while I'm young. Having said that, while freedom is the key thing, running water and electricity would also be lovely.


I know the bureaucracy around how people choose to live in the UK is fairly complicated and restrictive but I've few boxes to tick and am open to pretty much anything.  The most important thing would probably be not getting into a situation where I'd feel the money had been squandered, and I'd worry that if I rented somewhere that's what would happen. That is always a possibility though, depending on my options.


I should mention that at the moment I have no regular income (I'm just about to graduate from university, but am a couple of years older than most graduates) and am living with family when not at uni. This will definitely not be an ideal situation come the summer. If setting myself up with this money isn't a realistic option right now, it'll just have to be backpacking and working my way 'round the world, which I guess wouldn't be the worst thing to happen to somebody... I would also consider investing in somewhere or something abroad.


Anywho, as I'm considering applying for an arts grant (my university's career centre is generally only equipped to advise those seeking business and financial careers), and I'm totally bewildered as to my options, it would be really helpful to be able to formulate some kind of idea of what's possible. Any advice would be very much appreciated!

1313358084.0,28,self.simpleliving,jiqvy,"My new Composting setup (includes human""waste"") [X-post from Frugal]",39,11,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/simpleliving/comments/jiqvy/my_new_composting_setup_includes_humanwaste_xpost/,"My outdoor [toilet](http://i.imgur.com/71Ncf.jpg) consists of a hand made table fitted with a toilet seat with a 20(ish) gallon muck bucket underneath.   

Poo/kitchen scraps go into the bucket and then get covered with a handful or two of sawdust or pine shavings.   (Before you ask, it smells fine, all you smell is the pine shavings/dust(mostly pine dust)). [Here's what it normally looks like](http://i.imgur.com/AqBBI.jpg)

Today I built a new proper compost bin out of 4 used pallets and some vinyl twine and I thought I'd share the process with you guys.

([complete album for those without RES](http://imgur.com/a/rFC0p#vAZ6n))
Stage 1: Put it together.

http://i.imgur.com/Tcv7y.jpg

http://i.imgur.com/hiprn.jpg    
  
Stage 2: Prepare the initial Ingredients  
[Bucket of poo / used Mouse cage bedding](http://i.imgur.com/xFeJK.jpg)  
[Poured in the mouse bedding](http://i.imgur.com/1IJXa.jpg)  
[Someone gave me an old rotten bale of hay](http://i.imgur.com/pwR7o.jpg)   
[Couple pitch fork loads into the bin](http://i.imgur.com/FXT4i.jpg)   
[In goes the poo bucket](http://i.imgur.com/dPwKF.jpg)  
The initial ""whiff"" of air here was a bit pungent.   I looked and could not identify any actual poop.   Mostly I just see wet shavings and some paper products I tossed in there recently.      
[Spent 20 minutes weeding my garden/yard and threw that in as a cover material](http://i.imgur.com/YBswa.jpg)     

I'll be adding a couple tubs worth of mice bedding later today and probably some more weeds.  
 
This bin will be on a 3 year cycle.  3 years must pass after adding the last bucket containing human waste.  I'll continue to add yard waste until it's full and as it shrinks.   According to my book the final product will be ~20% of the original mass/volume.   Should take me about a year or two to fill it up.   That bucket contained about 2 months worth of poo and bin is only filled up about 10-15%.  (figure 2-3% once it's composted)  It looks about half full but those weeds/straw will shrink and compact very quickly.   

My timeline/recipes are based off of the [Humanure Handbook](http://www.google.com/#hl=en&amp;cp=9&amp;gs_id=12&amp;xhr=t&amp;q=humanure+handbook&amp;qe=aHVtYW51cmUg&amp;qesig=tRyxY7xElmdFbepqAGhWJw&amp;pkc=AFgZ2tnMrSvStpPSAuOO3iTZYuKWNCRLcXP-W_7Dar0PsLTTrWspXg1Qa0uMvcLkPIrX0AsKamYYBfX6XAd8R8GK37R7BpxoTg&amp;pf=p&amp;sclient=psy&amp;safe=off&amp;site=&amp;source=hp&amp;pbx=1&amp;oq=humanure+&amp;aq=0&amp;aqi=g5&amp;aql=&amp;gs_sm=&amp;gs_upl=&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.&amp;fp=1a2cc6000ca7d280&amp;biw=1024&amp;bih=649) and other online resources.  

Some background on this.   I choose to do this initially out of necessity (I do not have a functional bathroom, at the moment).    Now that I understand how this works I choose not to have a normal toilet again.   

This is entirely too simple, too easy and makes too much sense.   My poo is no longer ""waste"" or trash.  It's a valuable commodity that I can recycle and eventually use to grow food with.   

I will no longer pay money to throw away something that that is valuable and useful to me.

I am soon to be moving into my car for a multitude of reasons and I would love to hear any sort of advice. In short I would like to know if anyone else on here has lived in a car before (or a very small living space for that matter) and could share with me some tips on how to make it work. I could easily throw a bunch of my possessions in the back and try to manage, however I simply want to keep things minimal, and organized for peace of mind. Could you help me with any organizational systems that you have found to be useful or help me determine what I will need and no more, no less? 

I plan to purchase a rechargeable inverter/battery unit, a solar panel, rooftop carrier, collapsible sink, 1 lamp, several candle lanterns, and plan to build a shelf in the back on one side. I will also have small plastic organizers. For what its worth it is a jeep grand cherokee!

I googled, but the results all left me with unanswered questions, so I thought I'd check what others have/thinks.

Here is my ~~current~~ **updated** list:

* Dishwash soap (dishes, floor, regular cleaning)

* Machine wash soap (clothing)

* ~~Brown soap~~ (not sure what the English equivalent is, but its for cleaning inside oven. Apply soap, turn on oven. Later remove soap) - Replaced with vinegar

* ~~Woolwash soap~~ (for hand washing things that can't handle machine wash) - Replaced with shampoo

* ~~Chlorine~~ (remove mold from bathroom) - Replaced with vinegar

* ~~Limelite~~ (remove chalk from bathroom) - Replaced with vinegar

* ~~Toilet soap~~ - Replaced with vinegar

* ~~Acetic acid~~ (for cleaning coffee machine internally) - Was vinegar all the time

* ~~Denatured alcohol~~ (for removing glue residue and the likes) - Replaced with vinegar

* (and vacuum cleaner)

Added:

* Vinegar

* Baking soda



Are there some multi purpose products I'm not aware of or other advice? Some links I didn't find? Me, I'd like products to smell good or not smell at all, but all info will be appreciated, since I hope people with different needs than me can get something out of this talk too.

There's a lot of reasons for simplicity, and a number of flavors of it.  Some of these reasons contradict each other, so we have to make a tradeoff.

For example, I wanted a cooler to bring on a long drive, so I could bring a few meals with me rather than having to eat junk food.  Fine.  But I didn't own a cooler.  I had two choices: a $15 Coleman camping cooler or a $5 throwaway styrofoam cooler.  

- if I buy the Coleman I'm buying something reusable and ostensibly better for the environment, although it costs more.  In reality I'm not sure how much it'd really be better for the environment, since I very, very rarely ever need a cooler.  Plus, it becomes one more thing I have to keep and store in my house forever.

- if I buy the styrofoam, I have something I can use and then get rid of.  This may be worse for the environment, but it lets me keep one less piece of clutter in the house.  Plus I'm saving $10, and as this is the only cooler I've ever bought in my lifetime, the odds of me spending &gt;$10 on future styrofoam coolers really is pretty low.

I went with the styrofoam, because to me being clutter-free is more important than being eco-friendly.  I'm pretty eco-responsible in general, but am willing to be less so than some others for the sake of a clutter-free lifestyle.


Which tradeoff would you make, and why?

The insight, the discussion; it may be slow moving, but I will take quality over quantity any day.

So I will try to keep this fairly short.  As a former engineering student, I was enhanced with science, and in many ways, still am.  The why of how our entire universe works amazes me; and even moreso that we can describe and in many cases, replicate these processes.

However, I'll lay out a couple of questions.

* Do you believe many of the great scientists led what we believe to be a ""simple life"", and more importantly, were they happy?

* It is commonly said that before any kind of real technology, hunter-gatherer stage, that the average human lifespan was above fifty (and if you remove child deaths, this goes up to around seventy).  Would you see that as a desirable life?

* The one main ethical area of science, medicine, is concentrated solely on one thing; delaying death, and indeed, it has done a good job of doing so over the past one hundred years.  Was man meant to delay death to the point we have, and ever so further?

We homeschool our kids, make italian smallgoods, pickle saurekraut, ride a cargo bike etc.  We're quite thrifty, environmentally
minded, successful but I suspect we have some anxiety from having to battle our way into the position we are today. 

Our major problem is that our garage is full of chairs, sofas, an extra fridge, tools a newish but crap plasma TV and other ""useful stuff"" from our storage locker we gave up to save money. We park our cars on the street instead. We don't throw anything away because of stupid reasons like ""we should have a garage sale"" or ""we should hire a truck and take this to the markets"".  This doesn't happen because we are too time poor to organise this. Also because our neighbourhood is fairly nice and we suspect no-one would buy our ""junk"" except maybe students/artists or thrifty people from low socioeconomic backgrounds hence we would need to advertise heaps.

Our in house storage under the stairs is full of carefully packed kids clothes, fabric etc. kept ""in case we have another kid"". I have a home brew kit stashed to ""make ginger beer"" sometime. Old pots and pans (still perfectly serviceable) are carefully packed in a box etc. 

We have heaps of kids books toys and games around too.   Many of the kids favourite toys have been rescued from markets and cleaned up. Lego is still the most favourite. 

Now it's come to a head as we are redecorating and have splurged on some furniture and have to get rid of some trashed chairs and a bookcase. i have to either do a ""bulk collection"" pickup by the council or hire a dumpster. It's tempting to just throw heaps of in our mind at least ""serviceable useful stuff"" out that we would have just loved for our first student flat etc.

The house is a three bedroom, and two of the bedrooms are upstairs. It is only the two bedrooms and an accompanying bathroom upstairs, so I would just ignore the temperature in those rooms and take steps to reduce airflow to those rooms were they not in use. I decided to get roommates, so those rooms will be in use. Here are the problems:

- One of my roommates likes his bedroom to be cool when he sleeps. Keeping the second floor even remotely cool requires that I set the thermostat on the first floor to 68
- Both the A/C unit and furnace are about 20 years old, as far as I can tell. I have a feeling replacing the A/C will pay for itself in a few years.
-There is a massive A/C leak in the basement. It looks like the previous owner cut a hole in the duct and just attached an air vent to the foamboard ceiling under it, but didn't seal the space around the vent where it intersects with the duct. I'm thinking of just sealing this off, because the basement is generally fairly cool anyways.
- I can tell that the ground floor is insulated, but I don't know if the second floor is. I need to find out, because the second floor is where the heat is really building up.

My question is: what ways would you recommend to reduce energy consumption? Here are my ideas:

- Seal off the leaking section of the A/C to reduce waste. Also check the rest of the A/C system for leaks.
- Replace the old A/C unit with a newer high-efficiency unit
- Ask the roommate if he would be willing to switch to the downstairs bedroom where I'm sleeping. The square footage in his room is actually higher, so I'm not sure how willing he will be, especially since I'm renting the room for a flat rate that includes utilities. He might be interested since 68 is the lowest I'm willing to go, and his room is still warmer than he would like. If he was downstairs, he could have the perfect temperature.
- Have an ""energy auditor"" do a pressure test to find the sources of air leaks in the house so that I can seal them
- Get a particular brand of blackout shades (not curtains) which creates a seal along the entire window, preventing air from flowing, which will greatly increase insulation. These are rather expensive (~$150-200 per window) but supposedly do an excellent job providing insulation
- Find out if the second floor is actually insulated and insulate it if not
- Purchase a Nest thermostat to track energy usage and program it to use as little energy as possible. Right now I have a pathetic non-programmable thermostat which only allows for a minimum and maximum temperature setting.

Vacuuming is actually enjoyable. The cord is very short and I'm going to replace it with the Euraka's cord (eh, not that bad). Bags and extra cords costs about $10 (cheap).

What's great about bagged vacuums is that the dust and dirt get compacted into a small brick unlike the cotton-candy-dust-ball you get with bagless.

(x-post from /r/sustainable_homes),30,13,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/simpleliving/comments/1ie73v/simple_living_as_a_business_startup_xpost_from/,"I'm a 23 year old engineering student in the process of designing and building my first micro-homestead on a 0.7 acre property in East Texas, and then helping friends and relatives pursuing the same goal. I'm extremely interested in the simplicity of the self-sufficient lifestyle and my #1 goal is to help myself and others let go of our dependence on centralized food and utilities so that we can focus on our own well-being. I've decided on the Monolithic dome for the basic structure of the homestead due to its overwhelming resilience and energy efficiency.

Specifications for my first homestead are:

* The house should be large enough (a 30' diameter dome, roughly 700 sq. ft.) to comfortably house one or two occupants either as a main residence, or just be a place for them to get away and relax. I want to design a compact but open living space where nothing feels cramped or short on storage space.

* It should be able to function entirely off-grid through solar panels, and possibly wind turbines, but still connect to grid power for high-energy appliances like the washing machine.

* Be able to collect, filter, and heat all the water needed for drinking, cleaning, aquaculture, and gardening by xeriscaping the property to divert rainwater through an earth-and-gravel filter into a cistern large enough to sustain the occasional East Texas drought. Drinking water can be pumped inside and purified, and another cistern for solar heating the water will be near the bathroom.

* Finally, it should be able to grow enough food to meet the occupants' nutritional needs or at least supplement their diet. The property is located within a homeowner's association where farm animals like goats and chickens are disallowed, so we'll have an aquaponic system to cultivate fish, fruit, and vegetables.
In order to save money and acquaint myself with the nuts-and-bolts of sustainable design and construction, I'll be doing most of the work myself and bringing in contractors for the stuff that absolutely has to be done right the first time.

However, I'm still struggling with questions and considerations such as whether the project is too ""niche"" to be sellable, who I should be expecting to buy a self-sustainable home in the area I'm building in (and therefore what design style to tend towards), and how much I could expect to sell for. I'd appreciate any tips and suggestions you have to give on the matter, I really need some outside constructive criticism from people who have some idea what they're talking about.",,False,,t5_2r0za,False,,,True,t3_1ie73v,http://www.reddit.com/r/simpleliving/comments/1ie73v/simple_living_as_a_business_startup_xpost_from/,

It was fun for me, to own a real *library* of DVDs for myself and guests to peruse. But recently my life changed. First the video store I worked for for years closed, and I suddenly my collection nearly doubled, many of the new movies missing their cases. Movie lover that I am I couldn't watch all these old friends get tossed in the dumpster! Something had to be done! The second big change came when I moved in with my girlfriend.

We are just running out of space and our once happy home is slowing being taken over by crap. My once proud collection is now an out of control mess. It already took up an entire bookcase, and now that case is overflowing. I bought a very large 320 DVD binder, but my stupid nerdbrain loves having cases on a shelf, a library to peruse, artwork to see. Of course the artwork won't fit in the binder, and now I'm at a standstill trying to decide what stays on the shelf and what gets hidden in the binder. Furthermore I keep coming up with other stupid reasons like ""obviously all the tv shows (a whole shelf) need to stay in the boxes because the boxes have all the episode lists and descriptions."" my girlfriend keeps saying to put everything that's not a collectors eddition in the binder and be done with it, and I know she's right, but it is so hard to give up the cases, and I don't know why, and I know this mentality is killing my declutter mission before its even begun.

Is that we have taller buildings, but shorter tempers
Wider freeways, but narrower viewpoints
We spend more, but we have less.

We have bigger houses, but smaller families
More conveniences, but less time.
We have more degrees, but less sense
More knowledge, but less judgement
More experts, but more problems
More medicines, but less wellness.

We have multiplied our possessions, but reduced our values.
We talk too much, love too seldom, and hate too often
We have learnt how to make a living, but not a life.
We have added years to life, but not life to years.
We've been all the way to the moon and back
But have trouble crossing the street to meet the new neighbour.

We have conquered outer space, but not inner space.
We've cleaned up the air, but polluted our soul.
We've split the atom, but not our prejudice.
We've higher incomes, but lower morals.
We've become long on quantity but short on quality.

These are the times of tall men, and short character;
Steep profits, and shallow relationships.
These are the times of world peace, but domestic warfare,
More leisure, but less fun; more kinds of food, but less nutrition.

These are the days of two incomes, but more divorces;
Of fancier houses, but broken homes.
It is a time when there is much in the show window, and nothing in the stockroom.

A time when technology can bring this letter to you,
And a time when you can choose,
Either to make a difference .... or just hit, delete.

Her claim is that it's impossible to live simply and minimally with kids.  I beg to differ.  We have a three-year old.  He has enough clothes to go 3 days.  We buy used clothing or get hand-me-downs.  Every few months I go through his toys and clothes and donate those that aren't used to the local orphanage.

I don't buy plastic or ""specific"" toys.  His toys are all wood or cloth and are ""open-ended"" so he can play with them for years.  Prime example, his wooden train set and wooden airplanes.

Just wondering if you have any other ideas I can pass on to my friend (and prove my point lol).

Edit:  Just to be clear. I'm not saying my way is best. It works for my family, but might not for others. I'm cool with that.

And yes, I realize that as my child gets older I will have to shift the way I do things and be flexible. I helped raise a sibling 12 years my junior, I totally get that things change as they get older. Honestly, my main point here is that you CAN live simply with a child. Not that it's the right way or the only way, simply that it can be done. And my friend has put a couple of suggestions (toy rotation, limiting the number of shoes) of mine into effect. Just as I've taken several of hers about living greener (cloth coffee filters FTW).

I made the joke at some point in the trip that we couldn't crash because everything I cared about in life was in that car.  

This week I came home from vacation and decided that I am selling my house and getting rid of all the crap.  I have never been attached to 'things', but somehow when you have a decent sized home items make there way in and tend not to leave again.  

I may be making a deal with the homeowner this weekend that I could be living in that same beach house in exchange for painting the exterior and basically house sitting over the winter off season. So, my question is, what do I really need?  I know I tend to over simplify and think I can live with a few scraps of clothing and a computer, but there is that nagging feeling that I am just being insane.  
My (not desert) island list so far:
Clothes,
Computer,
Toiletries, 
Tools,
Bikes,
Kid,
His (favorite) toys

I've seen suggestions for each individually but not a site that advocates all three together. Is there a reason for this?

As a shampoo:
Rub in, 
Leave in for a while, 
Rinse out with warm water and apple cider vinegar

As a facial wash:
Rub in, 
Leave in for a while, 
Use a cloth dipped in warm water until it cools a few times, 
Use ACV with warm water as a facial toners

As a body wash:
Rub in, 
Leave in for a while, 
Use a cloth dipped in warm water and ACV to rinse off

What are people's thoughts on this? Has anyone tried it? Using a few simple ingredients appeals to me and I feel it would save time as well as help my dry skin a great deal. I just feel like I'm missing something as the idea is maybe too simple perhaps?

Update: So as a test I tried Plain Ol' Olive Oil (Colovita 100% Organic Cold Production) and Apple Cider Vinegar (Not Bragg's but it looked liked it had a bit of mother of vinegar) Also coconut oil based body spray.

Method: Rubbed Olive Oil in from Hair to Toe. Wash Cloth dipped in roughly 1/2 cup ACV to 3 cups warm water (used it twice, once for hair and one for face and body). Started with the face, worked the body and then hair last.

For the face: Success! My skin feels lovely and refreshed.

For the body: OK. Same refreshing feeling, if I did feel a tad bit dry. Jumped in the shower quickly as well for a quick rinse which may have contributed to me adding some coconut oil based moisturising body spray. But maybe I put too much ACV (1:5?). I should have just left it. No deodorant in today to see what happens though!

For the hair: Applied Olive Oil to start. Then left in while I did the whole body and face. I just poured it on top and rinsed it out. I don't think I got it all out though and it feels slightly oily to touch. I should probably have taken care and rubbed the hair properly, but I imagined it would have kinda ""melted"" the oil off!

Conclusions: Not a bad first trial. If the Castor Oil makes it thicker I think that's a good thing so I'm massaging rather than smearing. I might try less ACV (just to be more frugal) as I feel maybe the warm water takes care of removing the oil (must make sure not to clog the drains though!). A lot more time consuming than first imagined, I couldn't do it daily. But I guess unless I get into a sweaty mess, I wouldn't need to. 

Next steps - Castor Oil + Olive Oil / Witchazel + ACV
Maybe even real coconut oil with essential oils post-shower, for the times I just want to have a quick rinse...",,False,,t5_2r0za,1347931747.0,,,True,t3_z0oa6,http://www.reddit.com/r/simpleliving/comments/z0oa6/castor_oil_olive_oil_as_an_complete_hair_face/,
1341704869.0,15,self.simpleliving,w76n4,Simplifying in three stages. Helpful if you don't know where to start!,16,1,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/simpleliving/comments/w76n4/simplifying_in_three_stages_helpful_if_you_dont/,"I’ve spent the past two years radically simplifying my life. This simplification has come in three stages. We’ll call these stages **eradication, organization, and beautification.**

I first started simplifying by necessity. I had to move three times in four months. Every time I moved, I got rid of more stuff. If you really want to assess your possessions, try moving them. 

For me, simple living living is not a competition. I don’t aspire to have the least amount of things. I do aspire to live a somewhat sane, organized life in a crazy world. I want to live with gratitude and generosity, and I want to leave a lighter footprint.  I’ve learned a lot along the way, and I’m still working on it.

**Eradication**
The first step for me was eradication. I was at a weird place in my life, and one day I just said “fuckitall.” I gave away almost all of my clothes, I gave away expensive shit that was sitting around collecting dust (cameras, old computers, jewelry). It’s okay to sell stuff, but don’t waste time bargaining with greedy bastards. It’s not healthy. It won’t teach you any good lessons. I tried selling an old imac on Craigslist, but the potential buyer was an asshole. I gave it away to a family without a computer instead.

It can feel scary to give away expensive stuff. It’s also totally exhilarating. You’ll fee lighter once it’s gone.

**Organization**
After getting rid of excess stuff, I realized that my space was still a mess. I had papers everywhere, books and movies scattered around the house, and clothes thrown all over my floor. Thus began the organization phase.

For me, it was a matter of getting a few baskets, drawers, filing folders, and shelves. You still need a place to put your important papers and clothes.

**Beautification**
After eradicating and organization, your space might feel really sparse. Simple is good, but it doesn’t have to be tomblike. I solved this by hanging up artwork (everything was handmade or acquired freely/cheaply), getting a few houseplants, putting fresh (wild)flowers around the house, and acquiring a few small rugs. My space no longer looks depressing. It looks alive and “lived in.”

**Patience**
For me, simple living is largely about patience and diligence. I wait patiently for the things I want (unless it’s an emergency). 

Right now, I feel like I have everything I need. This is a fun place to be. It means that I can slowly, patiently start upgrading.

I walked around my house today and took some photos of little things that have worked for me. If anyone is interested, I can post an album. Otherwise, I’ll stop here! Best of luck!

1332119690.0,13,self.simpleliving,r2rph,Ideas for living without a conventional bed or futon? I am seeking sleep surface alternatives for super-minimal living.,17,4,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/simpleliving/comments/r2rph/ideas_for_living_without_a_conventional_bed_or/,"It seems like beds are something we never even question, at least here in the US, so let's discuss living without a bed.

The rationale for me: As I prepare to move across town to a rented room in May, I realize the only thing I own that actually requires a truck to move is my bed. Otherwise, I could get a couple rides in a friend's car or take two trunkfuls via taxi. As you can see, I am already pretty minimal -- but am thinking of going even leaner because I plan to move to a farflung place (possibly Alaska) next year, and obviously I wouldn't be taking much of anything. So I thought maybe I'd rid myself of it sooner rather than later and replace it with...*something.*

Currently: I sleep on a basic full-sized foam mattress, maybe 5"" thick. I have an inexpensive Ikea frame that lifts me about 10"" off the ground, but that seems kind of unnecessary since I don't use the space underneath. Also, I find that I never use more than half of the bed's width. A twin is all I need.

Options/Ideas/Questions:

* Is there some kind of adult sleeping mat?

* I don't know much about camping gear, but is there some kind of awesome sleeping bag that would make sense in the home?

* Could I put a sleeping bag on top of a big yoga mat or some kind of foam pad?

* Could I, like, stuff a duvet full of hay or something?  (Not that I know where I'd get hay in Chicago proper...but just trying to be creative)

* I thought about air mattresses, but those don't seem sustainable, and I don't really like how they feel anyway...like I'm on one of those pool rafts.

* Hammocks seem...dangerous, at least for a klutz like me. 

* Do Japanese people sleep on those tatami mats, or are those just for sitting? For some reason, I am convinced that there's a good idea out there from China, Japan, Korea, India...or some other non-Western country.

* Other thoughts? Has anyone done this for an extended period?

I will be gone for a few hours and will check in later. Talk amongst yourselves!  :)",,False,,t5_2r0za,False,,,True,t3_r2rph,http://www.reddit.com/r/simpleliving/comments/r2rph/ideas_for_living_without_a_conventional_bed_or/,

The idea is this. Australia is a country with out of control real-estate prices. Buying a house and land package in the greater metropolitan regions usually requires two professional incomes to support a 25-year mortgage. Australia is also obsessed with large spaces; rather than build up, we continue to unaffordibly build outwards. Apartments are also rare and unaffordable, with lofts and single-bedroom apartments having their value forced up by a trendy elite.

My idea is this: A co-op owned house in a nice suburb, with 8-10 mortgagees (perhaps 4-5 couples) contributing to the creation of a large house designed to inhabit a number of singles, couples, and families who democratically set house procedure and use shared space. Architecturally I invision a large industrial kitchen producing low-cost eco-friendly food on a lower floor, a large shared space with areas for reading, entertainment, and eating on the second floor, and individual spaces on a third floor.

From a minimalism perspective, such an idea supports economies of scale and in effect the house functions as a local economy. Such a house requires only one TV, one (large) dining table, one large kitchen, and one internet plan. With the right individuals, the idea also supports small-scale agriculture like vegetable gardens and shared use of vehicles.

At least here in Australia 8-10 professionals on modest professional incomes (say, $60,000) could easily afford a half acre in a good suburb. I like the idea, but finding sufficiently stable and financially secure individuals to buy in to the project would be difficult.",,False,,t5_2r0za,False,,,True,t3_g7izm,http://www.reddit.com/r/simpleliving/comments/g7izm/young_professional_housing_cooperatives_shared/,

I'm looking for two things:

1.) A reliable dial-up provider on the east coast of the United States (philadelphia), or, alternatively, an extremely cheap DSL option.

why: slower internet = less time on the internet (because it is less enjoyable). By that logic, less exposure to advertising, television, news, youtube, music downloading, movie downloading, and porn. Also, obviously, it's cheaper.

2.) Find a good text-only browser (or at least some level of forced-simplicity)

why: to complete the simplicity of the set up. Text-only would motivate me to do little more than read online. Reading and email, not too bad.

I have shed most of my non-essential possessions, and I'm pretty happy with how it's going. I have a long term plan to buy a house and some land out in the mountains of Eastern Europe and enjoy a very early retirement. 

Part of the reasoning which permits quitting the confucian rat-race early is the extremely low cost of living in that area, versus the relatively high income where I am. To help further, my wife and I are looking into ways to offset our bills and living expenses: effectively homesteading supported with occasional professional contract work and invesments.

An example of the quandary I feel on the horizon is thus: I enjoy playing guitar, therefore I have a nice guitar and amplifier and some effects for it. Would it not make sense to simplify this into a quality acoustic instrument instead? That would ensure I'm not reliant on lots of power, not much in terms of maintenance or parts and would physically occupy less.

What about books? I have sold or given away most of my books and kept a few I couldn't find an easy replacement for. I mostly read on my kindle-  but owning a kindle demands internet access, a computer, replacement kindles in the future and so on.

What about music? I've got a real passion for listening to Jazz, but collecting boxes of physical media and hardware goes against my inclination to simplify - and the alternative for internet streaming or computer based ties me down.

I don't feel like I will be without the internet in my new home, but I don't like the idea of being tied to it and I can't see an alternative.

In fact there were so many talks that we wanted to attend we had to be really picky about what we wanted to see.

A lot of the speakers I saw could have easily been extended out for an extra hour and that way the information wouldn't have been so rushed.

I don't feel the facility was up to the task of supporting that many people in attendance. The rooms were simply too small, the environmental controls were lacking, traffic patterns caused too much congestion, and the lack of on-site or nearby lodging for people attending both days.

I'm hoping this subreddit may offer a nudge in a direction that may fit my idea of free lifestyle.

I've always claimed to have a desire to live a minimal lifestyle but my actions haven't backed up that claim as I own a lot of stuff for a 29 year old. I've been fascinated by the Tumbleweed Tiny Houses for a couple years now but have been scared to make a jump because of my own lack of knowledge (and lack of carpentry ability). Regardless, I'm at a turning point in my life with an upcoming divorce, an apartment that has tons of unused space and unused junk, a job that makes me money but I don't love and a current location that lacks good friends or family.

The trouble is that I am hesitant to take any step forward because I just can't grasp what options I may have. Here is what I desire:

* I want to live with less items in my life
* I want to live with mobility (easy to go where I want)
* I don't want to live off-the-grid (I want to be within a community of people ideally)
* I want a place where my two cats could live with me
* I want to live frugally (or, at least, reasonably)

I'd say those are the extent of the things I'm looking for. Tiny Houses seem so wonderful but they seem to lack mobility (as well as my lack of building expertise). Basically, I'm putting this out there to try to learn more about simple living and what my options may be as a newly single guy with options wide open.

TL;DR - Options wide open; want to live with less but be mobile and around people while being frugal as well",,False,,t5_2r0za,False,,,True,t3_1cd1lr,http://www.reddit.com/r/simpleliving/comments/1cd1lr/looking_to_learn_about_my_options_for_a_simple/,

To start off, I am a freshman at WWU in Bellingham, WA. This city is very eco-friendly and a great place to live. Next year I want to live off campus, but am not too keen on living in an apartment or house with lots of people. So, I thought about how much it would cost to buy/rent a plot of land, buy a shipping container, furnish the inside, and wire it up so that it was sustainable by itself. Now, I have no past experience to start this dream and that's why I thought reddit might be able to help!

Some things that I need to know:

* Price of renting/buying a plot of land
* Price of buying a shipping container and getting it delivered to said plot of land
* How to properly insulate the container so that it can be warm in the winter
* Cost/installation of electricity
* Cost/installation of solar panels(?) or some sort of self sustaining energy source
* and finally, overall cost that I could present to either my parents or a bank for a loan to get me started.

If reddit can help me out on this task, I would be incredibly grateful. I will post pictures of the progress made (if any), and update this thread as much as I can. Thanks in advance for any help you may be able to contribute.
