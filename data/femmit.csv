He’s thinking about the pride that comes from a hard day’s work. That’s why he signed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act to help women get equal pay for equal work. That’s why he cut taxes for working families and small businesses and fought to get the auto industry back on its feet. That’s how he brought our economy from the brink of collapse to creating jobs again – jobs you can raise a family on, good jobs right here in the United States of America.

When it comes to the health of our families, Barack refused to listen to all those folks who told him to leave health reform for another day, another president. He didn’t care whether it was the easy thing to do politically – that’s not how he was raised – he cared that it was the right thing to do. He did it because he believes that here in America, our grandparents should be able to afford their medicine…our kids should be able to see a doctor when they’re sick…and no one in this country should ever go broke because of an accident or illness. And he believes that women are more than capable of making our own choices about our bodies and our health care…that’s what my husband stands for.""

I think some boys kind of grow out of it or discover they don't like being teased themselves, but if bullying is such a big deal in the media right now, why do people still say things like ""boys will be boys"" so casually?

In my experience, when people hear that high-pitched shriek of annoyance from the girl being teased, they immediately tell the girl to calm down and ignore the boy. Some may tell the boy to ""quit bugging your [insert relation/peer]."" What's interesting to me is that no one usually intervenes before that point. A lot of times the girl says, ""Stop it!"" or even ""Leave me alone!"" early in the interaction and I guess the adults nearby are just hoping the kids will ""work it out themselves."" In my opinion, if the boy continues after the girl asks him to stop, the adult needs to intervene and say, ""[Boy's name], [girl's name] has asked you to stop. Please respect her request or you will go to timeout."" Don't wait for the girl to tattle/get help to make him stop or cry (which is often what the boy wants--kind of disturbing). Respect is highly emphasized with little kids in preschool and early elementary so I don't think  it would be difficult to implement. I think it is very important for adults to send the message to children that it is not okay to taunt others.

When I was in third grade, the boys decided that ""Shut-up means 'meet me in bed in 10 minutes',"" so whenever a boy would tease one of us girls in class, and we would say, ""Stop it! Just shut-up!"" then all the boys would be like, ""Oh, did you hear that? She wants to meet me in bed in 10 minutes!"" Whether they knew exactly what that meant or not, I'm not sure. I don't even remember if I truly understood. I just knew something about it was bad and embarrassing, and soon, when the boys would tease, the girls would either remain silent or try saying things like, ""please stop talking"" or ""be quiet."" Of course, then all the boys started coming up with what those phrases ""meant."" No one wanted to tell the teacher but I was tired of it so I told on the boy who was doing it most often. The boy's dad had to come in after school and I verified to the teacher exactly what was said. Whenever I tell that story now, everyone cringes and says how embarrassing it was for the boy because he probably didn't 'really' mean anything by it so why didn't I just ignore it? This always confuses me. If he was embarrassed, well, then he was embarrassed. We girls had been embarrassed by all the inappropriate teasing, and it needed to stop. Somebody needed to tell that kid it wasn't okay. If he genuinely didn't know what it meant, then I'm glad I brought it up so someone could explain it to him. The dad was probably embarrassed, too, but maybe that opened a door for discussion with his son. As a woman, I am tired of feeling uncomfortable so that the people making me uncomfortable are comfortable.  

To me, it is parallel to the way people talk about sexual harrassment. If girls are taught to just ""ignore"" the things boys do and say and no one tells the boy it is not okay to disrespect his peers, how does this pan out when a boy is copping a feel in the lunch line later on? What's the appropriate response for the girl? In her head, it's probably going to be along the lines of ""just ignore him, and he'll stop."" It may have worked in elementary school when the boy was ""being funny"" or wanting ""attention,"" but it is no longer so ""harmless""--it is a violation. In some ways, my third-grade example reminds me of the ""no means no"" concept. Girls are saying ""no"" or ""shut-up"" and the boys are saying, ""no means yes"" or ""shut-up means meet me in the bed in 10 minutes.""

I believe people need to start talking to boys (and men) about how act appropriately instead of sending the message to girls that they need to learn how to 'react' appropriately. I don't want my son teasing anybody. If a kid is teasing someone, he is not thinking about the other kid's feelings, and that is not the kind of kid I want to raise.

TLDR: I don't think girls being told to ignore boys' teasing is sending a good message to either party.",,False,,t5_2t857,False,,,True,t3_120mtk,http://www.reddit.com/r/femmit/comments/120mtk/the_experience_of_boys_teasing_girls/,

In it, she questions Rihanna's choice of clothing and states she deserves all the slapping around she can get. Several people (include some other family members) commented with Lols and variations thereof.

Not sure how to navigate this while seething at the breakfast table, I posted a reply stating my concern that people thought anyone could be deserving of violence. I acknowledged that she may have been joking but that the matter really isn't funny.

Stepmom replied. She said her previous experience in an abusive relationship gave her reason to respectfully disagree with my concern. She also said she'd leave it at that and wouldn't respond further. This also implies she wasn't joking.

Obviously, Facebook is not an appropriate forum for discussing this sickening sentiment with my stepmother, so I am not offended by her refusal to respond further (even though she chose Facebook as an appropriate forum for spouting such statements). I don't know how to respond, if at all.

Bit o' background: I don't live in the same state as my family, so I don't see my stepmother more than twice a year. We've never been close due to general tension between stepparents and stepchildren, and we generally keep our opinions to ourselves, because they are often conflicting.

""One of the things people always say to you if you get upset is, don't take it personally, but listen hard to what's going on and, please, I beg you, take it personally. Understand: every attack on Hillary Clinton for not knowing her place is an attack on you. Underneath almost all those attacks are the words: get back, get back to where you once belonged. When Elizabeth Dole pretends that she isn't serious about her career, that is an attack on you. The acquittal of O.J. Simpson is an attack on you. Any move to limit abortion rights is an attack on you -- whether or not you believe in abortion. The fact that Clarence Thomas is sitting on the Supreme Court today is an attack on you.""— Nora Efron '96 Wellesley commencement address

Not a huge fan of her movies, but the ideas expressed here rang true for me.

I've subscribed enthusiastically to this subreddit, but I've already balked a few times at posting, largely because I'm a man.  

Essentially, I'm conscious that Reddit is quite male-dominated, and that the more political of the female-oriented subreddits are often heavily populated by men giving male perspectives on gender issues. It's not that I think those perspectives are necessarily any less valid or interesting, but quite often, by sheer force of numbers, they drown out women's perspectives which I'd be interested in reading. They may also discourage some less confrontational women from giving their opinions at all. Obviously it's not up to me whether guys end up overrunning this place, but I don't want to be too big a part of that, so I'm trying to figure out a way to contribute sensitively without sanitising my opinions to the point where it's no longer worthwhile. If it isn't possible, I think it's probably better just to establish that and stick to lurking.  

So: how do you view men's role in this kind of forum? To what extent do you value our contributions? What raises your hackles or makes you wary?  

To be clear, I'm not asking any of you to provide a consensus – I know you can't do that - but I would appreciate your individual perspectives if you're inclined to share them.  
  
**EDIT:** Just want to say thanks for all the comments. In the spirit of the thread, I'm reading more than replying, but they are appreciated. Also a quick apology for writing a post about not wanting to dominate a women's subreddit, that subsequently ends up at the top of said subreddit  - I'm aware of the irony...",,False,,t5_2t857,True,,,True,t3_ngdsl,http://www.reddit.com/r/femmit/comments/ngdsl/how_do_you_feel_about_men_on_femmit/,

However, a while back, I decided to take some random summer classes at my college and I got ""indoctrinated"" by one of the best professors I've ever had the privilege to accidently learn under. 

The indoctrination mostly consisted of being forced to read various theory, finding relevant real-world examples on our own, and lots of discussion. It didn't tell me how to think, but provided a new way of thinking. It was one of the most engaging and thought-provoking periods of my life and gave me a push to stop being vaguely sad/meh about life and to start getting angry (which is way more productive it turns out). There's always something more to learn and someone else who wants me to speak for the entire movement but I'm really glad that I have a group of people in a similar boat. 

There are legitimate criticisms out there too of course. Especially when it comes to other avenues of discrimination like race and sexuality. Feminism can sweep some women under the rug for other women's benefit and that's incredibly important to talk about, but without the initial exposure to feminism, I may have not paid due attention to those issues either (which scares me). I think it's similar to how a lot of male atheists on reddit began tip-toeing into social justice.

Not quite.

So ladies, how do we win? When we fight fire with fire, we're hysterical, PMSing, crazy and over-reacting. When we try to smile sweetly and turn the other cheek, we're still told we're rude and wanting too much for ourselves... or we're swept under the carpet. What's the solution?

I've been jonesin' for a slightly different version of 2XC for a long time, and it sounds like some other members of the community have been, too. So my questions are as follows:

* What should the terms of the new subreddit be? My suggestion is a strict limit to acceptable self-posts (no haircuts, no breakup stories, no baked goods, no ""ow my cramps are so bad"" posts). Suggestions so far: a stipulation about aggregating copycat posts into one thread instead of clogging the queue (thanks aktuarie)


* Does anyone want to moderate? I've been a redditor for about 5 years but I've never actually modded a subreddit and don't have any CSS experience (though I'd be willing to learn)

* Does the subreddit name appeal to y'all?

* For sidebar links, I'm thinking we should link to the massive B.C. list from 2X, rape crisis resources, a link to /r/2xlookbook, a link to /r/TwoXChromosomes itself and....? (suggestions so far: /r/FancyFollicles, /r/RedditLaqueristas)

**EDIT:** Ok, I started entering stuff into the sidebar. Please take a look and see if there's anything missing/ worded poorly! I entered some stuff that came into my mind (like no rage comics) but everything is 100% open to discussion.

1325297157.0,34,self.femmit,nx051,For female YouTubers: How to get comments that aren't about your appearance. ,37,3,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/femmit/comments/nx051/for_female_youtubers_how_to_get_comments_that/,"I have run a mildly successful YouTube channel for five years now, and I have finally all but ceased receiving comments about my appearance or gender. How? Well, I started setting comments to approval on all of the videos I appeared in, and I let all of the comments through except the ones that referenced my gender. As time went on and I continued to do this, I flat out stopped getting these comments (for the most part).

I think this is because people are more likely to do something if they see other people doing it without consequence. On a video where most of the comments are ""Too bad my girlfriend isn't more like you"" or ""You're pretty!"", more people are likely to continue to leave these comments because everybody else is doing it. If they look down and see a discussion entirely about the content of the video and not the person in it however, then they're more likely to continue that discussion and not post whatever insightful thing they thought they'd share about your butt or your boobs.

I don't want to censor people, so I still let people who genuinely have gripes with my videos through. If they feel the need to call me a slut or a cunt while they do it though, that's where I draw the line.",,False,,t5_2t857,False,,,True,t3_nx051,http://www.reddit.com/r/femmit/comments/nx051/for_female_youtubers_how_to_get_comments_that/,

As for the rest, I need a soap box minute, I sincerely hope you will actually read all of it. As it is women's history month, I think it's time to educate our younger ladies about the women who got us where we are today, and make sure that the politicians who are trying to cause a backslide can't. Maybe I'm crazy, but there are MORE women in the US than men, certainly we can't all be of voting age, we're not all of the same party, belief system etc etc, but I'm sure there are enough who agree that our bodies, our rights, our lives are our own to run and control. I hope I'm not alone in being inspired by our history month. Funny ladies, politcal ladies, musical ladies, artistic ladies, athletic ladies, cooking ladies, all ladies, we've got work to do, and there are men in congresses, both state and national trying to invade our privacy and our reproductive rights. There are girls saying they'd let Chris Brown beat them, media allowing that kind of womanizing attitude to be acceptable. TV shows propping up the age old ""guys who sleep around rock, girls who do are sluts"". What is this, the 50s? Did we miss the sexual revolution? Did nothing change? I'm not saying ""march on Washington"" I'm saying, post ideas, let's group in communities, the only way anything changes is if we make it happen. WE don't like being ganged up on, I get the feeling boys won't either. Am I feeling a little evil? Maybe. Could I get down-voted into oblivion? Maybe. Do I care about up-votes or down-votes? NO. I'm for real. There will be no Tits or GTFO, there will be step the fuck off my opinion or I'm going to make you cry, because a vagina can bear an almost 9 pound child, you crumble up and cry if I kick you in the nuts. No this is not a war on men. It is not war in my mind, it is the idea that at some point, something has to give, and shit gets old. Women beating, rape, abortion, birth control, these are not jokes, nor are they things to toy with or buoy support with because religious groups get up in arms. I think it's time that the gender roles of society were not so much turned on their heads as shown for what they really are, psychological prisons, created to keep people in their societal confines. We are all equal, and we all deserve certain equal and unalienable rights, life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Incidentally, I think it's about time that someone reminded the religious right that most of the founding fathers were Deists, which is NOT Christian. I'm done. *steps off soapbox*

*TL;DR* Ladies, it's time we gave Amurica a swift kick up the gonads, because as we all know, unlike a VAGINA, balls are usually very tender when kicked which can lead to crying like a baby, general curling into a ball and realizing, over all, how weak one really is.

&gt; Avoid self-posts that look like journal entries, but feel free to pose interesting, thought-provoking questions to the community.

I think this logic should also be extended to comments. Please try to keep comments content based and relevant to the topic at hand, rather than nattering personal conversations.

Now, I understand that our personal experiences inform our lives &amp; thoughts, and they are important. Sometimes we need to share them to make a point. And I'm **not** saying we shouldn't share them, or should be shamed into thinking/feeling they don't matter. But when I see a long thread of comments in an otherwise topical discussion saying, ""Oh me, too,"" ""No, my husband blah blah,"" in what I can only describe as a circlejerk, I feel irritated &amp; think to myself, ""Wait, this place was supposed to be better..""

I suggest that if a conversation reminds you of an important topic, that you want to share it with *everyone*, but it isn't quite relevant to the discussion at hand, start your own separate post. And if what you have to say isn't important/interesting enough to warrant its own separate post, then please refrain from saying anything.

Therefore, to avoid circlejerks &amp; thread hijacks, the guiding principle should be, ""If you don't have anything kind *or relevant* to say, **don't say anything at all**.""

And for thoroughness, of course while I am suggesting separating posts *topically*, this in no way is meant to contradict other guidelines, particularly;

&gt; Copycat posts should be submitted as comments IN THE ORIGINAL POST so as not to clog up the queue

So, please ladies (&amp; gents &amp; gender fuckers &amp; mods et alia), I implore you: Make this place better.

I was reading the post by rebcart about some of the reasons why women don't speak up on the internet, and how gendered pronouns are an important battleground for her. [This](http://www.reddit.com/r/femmit/comments/nncu1/shit_like_this_is_why_women_dont_speak_up/c3ahm2t) comment in particular struck my interest (tl;dr: women are meek because society has conditioned them to be that way), because I *do* feel like I am a rather meek person. 

I am non-competitive, I like it when everyone gets along, and I tend to be the peacemaker of a given group, when necessary. I pride myself on my conflict resolution skills, and I get upset when I think someone else is mad at me. That being said, I'm in my final year as an engineering student and my upbringing has never given me any reason to doubt that I can do anything a man can do. 

What I want to hear opinions on is, how do you know what society has conditioned you to be, and what you genuinely are yourself, on your own? Is there really such a big difference? Growing up in modern society, it took me a long time to admit that I'm *not* competitive or super ambitious, and frankly, it makes me feel a little like I'm wasting some advantages that women before me have fought for. Still, this is how I am, and I shouldn't be made to feel bad about it any more than women who want to be CEOs should be made to feel bad.

I've seen more than one wonderful, loving relationship go up in flames because one partner (usually a gal) felt like she wasn't ""being swept off her feet."" That's not to say that she was ignored-- in the case I'm thinking of in particular, her partner was attentive, generous, and kind-- but she felt like she didn't feel as madly, passionately in love with as she had felt at first (this is 5-7 years into the relationship). It broke my heart to see such a seemingly wonderful relationship end for what appeared to me to be a pipe dream.

To what extent do you think the message that love that isn't ""mad, passionate, and extraordinary"" is a ""waste of time"" hurts women and men?

I was treated very poorly by their leader from the start and now that I'm no longer part of that group, I decided that I should do something positive for all the issues I, and probably you care about. 

I know there are many feminist blogs, pages and forums but Femen and other groups I had found before them, tapped into my desire to find a modern feminism (which still respects and pays tribute to the generations who paved the way) for all types of women, from teenagers who listen to Taylor Swift to older women of different ethnic backgrounds. Whether we are abolitionists or for the legalization of prostitution, whether we are housewives or bmx-riders, whether we read Vogue or Philosophy journals, I know there are some things we can all unite over, enjoy discussing and find thought-provoking. While still acknowledging that many of us are not only different women but also different people. And I am really hoping that I can make this page as international as possible as many pages I follow are either centered on North American feminist issues or French/European ones.
 
So, I want to make this a mix of everything from serious issues to pop culture references! On top of general feminist issues I care very deeply about the representation of women (or lack of) in the media, Hollywood etc. which I plan on posting about a bit!

What kind of birth control do you use, and have you faced any barriers to access? How does birth control affect your life?

I'm asking because I strongly believe that the personal is political. I'm curious about one's insurance policy affects birth control pricing, and I'm curious about the intersections between privilege and birth control access. 

I'll start! I currently pay ~$5/mo for a progesterone only pill which was prescribed to me at my university's student health center. I used to pay $10/mo for yaz, which was prescribed by a private doctor. I have not faced any barriers to birth control access since I started taking the pill for medical reasons at age 16. My mom was worried that being on hormonal birth control would encourage me to have unprotected sex (this didn't happen, I was not having intercourse when I started taking the pill). 

I have always had very painful periods but for a long time no one would believe me. My mom thought I was trying to make up a reason to start the pill and my doctor was not interested in investigating underlying causes. I was told that my pain was normal. *It was not normal*. I had disabling cramps, heavy bleeding, and menstrual migraines. I had very painful cramps and migraines even while taking yaz, but I put up with it because I didn't think there were any alternatives. I finally found a doctor who was willing to listen to me this year and she thinks that I have endometriosis. I don't have a period with my new pill and it is such a relief. I am so angry about being belittled, mistrusted, and discounted all these years though. 

I'm upperish class, white, cis, and pass as straight. My health insurance is through a parent's job with the federal government. I know that I a very privileged but I still had to deal with a lot of bullshit. As a teenager I felt judged for taking birth control. Everyone assumed that I only wanted the pill so I could have sex (why is that even bad?) and that attitude had very real, very painful health costs.

But I don't really know any other women who feel that way (or at least are very concealed about it - I have no qualms admitting my attractions to the same sex). I'm also curious about homosexual people who have dabbled in opposite-gender relations.

So, some questions for those of you who are or have been bi-curious:

1. What is your gender?
2. What do you rank on the [Kinsey scale](http://www.iub.edu/~kinsey/research/ak-hhscale.html)?
3. Have you ever messed around/had sex with a person of the same gender (or opposite, if predominantly homosexual)?
4. What conclusions did you draw from that/those experience(s)? (e.g. it was great, it was disappointing, decided to change your sexual orientation or not)
5. How would you feel if you had strictly homosexual/heterosexual relations for the rest of your life? Have you made plans to accomodate bisexual tendencies even if you find a life partner?

How do you do it?,26,8,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/femmit/comments/ohg6z/how_can_a_queerqueer_feminist_even_exist_on_the/,"Hey all. I'm having a problem with using the internet these days. I identify as a genderqueer person, and I'm also a geek. I love designing electronics, video games, computer engineering, and so on. This usually means I find myself on places like Reddit, or other ""nerdy"" websites.

Nowadays, it doesn't matter where I go, but I am assaulted with misogyny wrapped up in the ""Mens Rights"" banner. If I get into ANY intellectual discussion about sexual orientation or gender identity, sexual assault, or other issues that concern me as a feminist, I am shot down, insulted, belittled, or compared to ""male-bashers."" Literally every place I go or discussion I get into is hijacked and rammed into a wall at mach speed by the MRA supporters. 

It doesn't matter that I actually agree with some of their complaints and try to talk to them about it. For instance, I see the ""child custody"" problem (where a female is more likely to be awarded custody than a male) as a perpetuation of the ""male = breadwinner"" and ""female = caregiver"" stereotypes. I agree with them that it is sexism against men, as it is also sexism against women, and that sexism hurts both men and women and should be abolished. But it doesn't matter - their unabashed misogyny leaks through and eventually they're bringing up absolutely anything not-anti-oppressive a random feminist-identified person says on the internet as if I, personally, am responsible for their words. I feel like there are no safe spaces left - virtually any feminist or LGBT topic, thread or sub-reddit - including this one - have been viciously attacked by [/r/mensrights](/r/mensrights) on numerous occasions, and it's as if I can't discuss any feminist or queer topics without getting triggered and/or threatened. 

The entire internet itself seems to be barreling down a conservative road and I don't feel welcome anymore. Things were bad in the past, but now it's as if we're being violently and relentlessly waged war upon. Be it a blog, a news article, reddit, or hell, in the latest incident involving me, a forum about the TV show My Little Pony. It's endless. I can't ignore it, but if I pay it any attention... ugh.

So... how do you do it? How do you survive in this perpetually toxic environment? I almost want to write the entire thing off and become a luddite at this rate... that doesn't even sound half bad.",,False,,t5_2t857,False,,,True,t3_ohg6z,http://www.reddit.com/r/femmit/comments/ohg6z/how_can_a_queerqueer_feminist_even_exist_on_the/,

If you are an English-speaking teen or woman of color, age 13-45 you may be eligible to take part in a brief online survey. Specifically, we are seeking participants who identify as American Indian or Alaskan Native, Asian, Black or African American, Hispanic/Latina, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, or bi- or multi-racial. 

This survey is not for marketing or advertising purposes. Ibis Reproductive Health is a nonprofit organization and the goal of the survey is to collect information from women on their experiences with specific types of birth control so we can better understand their perspectives and improve women’s access to information and resources related to contraception.
As an additional benefit aside from aiding reproductive health knowledge, participants who complete the survey will be entered to win $100 gift cards as a bonus.

* a feminist was really mean to me once
* they’re sexist against men

As to some other comments arguing that modern feminism is no longer racist/homophobic/disablist, etc. While this may be true, I'm looking at the larger picture and I think those are some valid critiques of the feminist movement.

Do any of you other femmiters in a relationship where you consider yourself to have implied consent?",26,8,35,http://www.reddit.com/r/femmit/comments/pw5vf/can_implied_consent_ever_exist_do_any_of_you/,"This is a topic that I find interesting, especially as I'm about to get married to someone who has shown me nothing but love and support for over five years. I know that rape and sexual assault can exist within previously ""perfect"" marriages (as rape is possible in any relationship without seemingly any warning). I'm also aware that many, many people (including many of you in this forum) believe that sex while drunk and that sex without verbal consent is sex without consent period. Black and white, there's the line.

I'm wondering if there are any other self-described feminists here on femmit who feel that they fully understand the seriousness of the issue of consent but still ""throw caution to the wind"" in their personal lives by having sex while under the influence or by having sex without specifically saying ""Yes"" or without asking their partner if they will consent to sex.

I personally have had a conversation about implied consent with my fiance years ago in which I've stated ""If I say yes while drunk, it's a yes"" and we've also given each other reign over any kind of touching, etc. and are fine with saying ""I'm not in the mood, etc."" if it's unwanted. It's been brought up a few more times since by each of us while discussing feminist issues, political issues and sometimes as an aside from listening to a podcast on the issue. I personally feel like I've covered my bases by having this conversation multiple times while recognizing that such a conversation is not necessarily right for everyone.

So is there anyone else here who is in the same boat? Do you feel comfortable about your choice within the context of your relationship but not necessarily within the context of feminist identity? Or are you 100% comfortable with your decision? (I personally would say I'm 100% comfortable with my choice in the context of my relationship but sometimes I feel like it does conflict with how I feel about myself as a feminist).

What is do you think about this situation? Since this is an alt history novel the author could have easily made the women's movement start early and be in a more equal society at the get go but even I think I can see that making a female heroine during this time is more powerful than making a female heroine where that wouldn't mean as much.

[r/Pics post of Cayla and her Husband Seth, happy even in the face of deportation](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/ulzxj/these_pictures_are_of_an_amazing_couple_that/)

Immigration Laws need to be fixed to protect everyone. By deporting people like Cayla, victims of human trafficking, we are protecting no one. Absolutely no one is of benefit, and the cost of sending her back I think far outweighs any cost of letting her stay. 

Cayla is a charitable honors student about to graduate from Western Michigan University with degrees in psychology and interpersonal communications. Cayla is also a victim of Sex Smuggling and is risking deportation now that she is no longer a child. 

Living in China at the age of 12, her parents birthed a young boy. They were violating China’s one child policy. She had always been a disappointment in the eyes of her parents, but now she was worse. 

&gt;""The potato (is) worth more than you; they can feed people, what can you do?"" she recalled her father saying.
 
Two years later her mother died. The father then decided it was time to rid his life of his daughter. He decided to sell her into sex slavery. At the age of 14. He even expected her to send money back home to her family. 

&gt;""I have took care of you for 14 years now, and it's your time to give back,"" she recalled. 

She was sold to the Sex Smugglers known as [Snakeheads.]( http://news.sky.com/home/uk-news/article/15799328)
They brought her to California, where she was thankfully rescued by the San Diego PD.
She was found a foster home, and got a 3.97 GPA throughout school.  She volunteered for Hurricane Katrina relief, an adult clinic, homeless shelter, and to fix houses for those in need. She even became a mentor for Autistic children. 
&gt;""She perservered obviously through tough times getting here,"" said her English as Second Language (ESL) teacher Ben Lawrence. ""But once she was here, she wanted to learn English, get top grades, take the hardest classes we could offer here at Grand Haven, and she did it. She just had an incredible drive."" 

Now she is attending Western Michigan University, about to graduate. She met Seth Roberts in high school and they got married when he returned from the Air Force. 

Up until now, this story serves as an example of a strong-willed individual, finding success despite being faced with extreme hardships. Finding a new family to love her after her own threw her away, finding true love, bettering herself and helping those in need. She has been a personification of Mental Strength. 

But this isn’t the end of the story. Now ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) wants to deport her. She has been denied every attempt at staying. They denied her to stay for her marriage, they denied her asylum for religious persecution, and earlier they denied her to stay under  “Juvenile” status because of confusion over her date of birth. 

Cayla did not come here of her own free will. She was tossed away, and taken here. Without papers, without money, alone and lost.  After her rescue, she flourished in a loving environment. Now we all risk throwing her away again.  The Snakeheads have threatened her for years, if she is deported, she risks their retaliation. If she were lucky enough to avoid that, there is that issue of her father. 

&gt;""There's no home for you here anymore, and there's two options if you ever come home,"" she quoted him as saying. ""One option is, either I will kill you, cuz there's no home for you here anymore, or I will just give you a bottle of medicine and you can take care of it yourself, just kill yourself."" 

If she eludes her father and the Snakeheads, she would still be forced to live in a country that views her as a traitor. She would have to ask permission from China to become a citizen of the US, and this would take years. In these years, she would be living in fear for her life. 

But this doesn’t have to happen. The Obama administration has created something for ICE called “[Prosecutorial Discretion]( http://www.ice.gov/doclib/secure-communities/pdf/prosecutorial-discretion-memo.pdf)” for cases such as this. It is supposed to be exercised to block deportation of people who are at risk, such as victims of sex smuggling or human trafficking. The problem is, out of 219,000 cases reported to ICE for Prosecutorial Discretion, only 7.5% of them have been approved. Given her track-history with ICE, the outlook is grim. 

This is where you can come in. Do you wish to help Cayla, her husband, and her new family? There is a way you can. [Here is her Change.org petition.](http://www.change.org/petitions/cayla-roberts) Sign it. We hope that gathering thousands of signatures to show support for Cayla might help ICE reach a positive decision. 
If you can think of any other ways to help, by all means do it. I’m just an ordinary man, but I’m trying to promote her story in any way I can. THANK YOU for taking the time to read this. 

**tl;dr: Cayla is a victim of Human Trafficking, is a successful member of American Society and is risking Deportation.

I'm not 100% sure if this is the right place for this question, and I'd like to start with a disclaimer about how I'm sure that I'm using problematic language when talking about this. I'm totally open to getting school on how I should frame/phrase this BUT

I saw an incredible ad awhile back from the point of view of a female sex worker (she was also a woman of color). She was undressing and explaining how she was forced into sex work. The video featured an ever changing ""John"" (mostly white, middle aged males) sitting on a hotel bed. The point of the ad was that men can prevent girls from being forced into this by not paying to have intercourse with minors. 

I wanted to share it with my roommate but I can't find it ANYWHERE on the internet. Has anyone seen it? Do you know who sponsored it? I'm incredibly curious and I'd appreciate some help!

Thanks!

Over the past year, I've embraced my identity as a feminist. Throughout that process, I've learned a lot about myself. I've realized that many of what I previously perceived as ""wrong"" with me is a result of societal pre-conceived notions and expectations about women, and that has been very liberating. 

I have always been very passionate about class issues. I come from a working class family, but grew up in a very affluent environment, which has allowed for some interesting perspectives. I went to college and found a lot of information about socio-economic class, which has furthered my beliefs. 

I love being a feminist, but I've found that much of the dialogue comes from a very specific, upper-middle class, white perspective. For example, the idea of corporate advancement as a sign of success. The discussion focuses mostly on salaries and CEO positions. While I definitely understand that this is important, I find when the feminist narrative revolves around these issues, it is very exclusionary to women outside the educated, white-collar, middle-class spectrum. If we continue to measure these signifiers as an indication of the success of women, we are ignoring so many other women. 

I was wondering if anyone could point me in the direction of feminist work that includes an emphasis on class? Much appreciated.  ",,False,,t5_2t857,False,,,True,t3_rptne,http://www.reddit.com/r/femmit/comments/rptne/feminism_and_class_dialogues_that_include_both/,

Also, is anyone as upset as I am to see the reaction it is getting across reddit? The ""Oh, it's too inflammatory to do any good"" argument strikes me as an excuse to not acknowledge the very real problems presented in the article. Yes, her tone is defensive and yes, it is at times exaggerated, but can you really blame her? These bills are popping up left and right and the sole purpose is to undermine women's rights. Even if you're personally unaffected by these types of bills, your sisters, mothers, cousins, neighbors, friends and girlfriends are under attack by these conservative zealots.

Why or why not?),12,3,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/femmit/comments/nwwnz/talking_to_your_partner_about_birth_control_when/,"Something happened recently that made me wonder about other women's birth control discussion/sharing/planning habits. 

Many months ago, I decided to look into the Fertility Awareness Method (or FAM, made popular mostly, I believe, by [Toni Weschler and her book](http://www.tcoyf.com/) ). I did some online research, bought the book, and devoured it. It was fascinating to find out so much about how our bodies and menstrual cycles work, and how (with discipline and the right tools) you can chart your fertility to use as birth control. I told my boyfriend all about it and he was eager to learn with me and help me out in any way (background info: we'd been dating for about a year, are condom users interested in condomless sex as long as it's safe)

I was talking about the book/method a few months later with a close friend of mine. She seemed very interested to learn about it, since she's not keen on hormonal birth control, so I lent her the book. Recently I went over to her place (right before her boyfriend arrived) and she gave it back to me. I was going to leave it sitting there til I left, but she said ""oh, put it in your bag so [her boyfriend] doesn't see it."" I told her I don't mind if he sees it, and she said ""no, I mean, it would be weird if he saw that I had that.""

I know it doesn't sound like much, but it made me disappointed and a bit frustrated. They've been dating for about 4 months now, and my friend is always talking about how comfortable she feels with him, how much in love they are, how it feels like they've been together forever. Of course every relationship is different, but I wish she felt like it was normal to talk to him about birth control beyond whatever they already use (I assume condoms). They said ""I love you"" to each other very early in their relationship, but sex still came first. I wish it were easier for women to be open about knowing about their bodies and cycles. 

What are your opinions about birth control and talking about it in a relationship? Have you had to discuss it with your partner further than ""don't worry, I'm on the pill""? Do you think you'd be comfortable talking to them about how your cycle works and getting them ""involved"" in it?",,False,,t5_2t857,True,,,True,t3_nwwnz,http://www.reddit.com/r/femmit/comments/nwwnz/talking_to_your_partner_about_birth_control_when/,

I think some people thought... well, I don't know what some people thought. 


[Link to the video on Vimeo](http://vimeo.com/31886254). Also, sorry about the quality, it's much better on the DVD I burned but I think Vimeo makes it a little jaggedy/jumpy.


This is a link to an interview that my classmates and I made, where we interviewed three local (and untraditional) women artists in my state of Oklahoma. We asked them questions such as how did being a woman affect them and their success, how did they suggest other artists of all genders break into the art scene (since we're college age and just starting) and what being an artist in general in Oklahoma was like! I know most people don't think ""ART!"" when they hear ""Oklahoma"" so it was very encouraging to talk to these women. 

One thing that also interested me about them was their backgrounds. One is a young woman, just starting, who has a boyfriend. One is a married woman who has been in the business most of her adult life, and works alongside her husband. And one is a woman who grew up in the art 'scene', who is married *but* they also share a girlfriend. I couldn't believe how awesome it was that my friends and I each chose an artist who was so different. It was a really great and enlightening day (we did all the interviews over a course of 12 hours, but don't worry, the video is only 13 minutes long if you choose to watch), and I'll never forget it.


I guess some of the discussion questions I'd like to ask Femmit are:

*How do you perceive the differences in art by women or art by men?

*Do you think there are any? 

*Do you think it has more to do with age and/or ambition?

*If you are into art or art history, do any female artists come to mind when you think of art history? (I certainly learned a lot more in this specific Art by Women course than I ever did in a Survey of Art History course.)

*Did you know there are a lot of famous artists that cross-dressed? Some even in the early 1900s!

1. Have you had a horrible experience at a hairdressers?  

2. What tips/tricks do you have to get the best out of your hairdresser?  

I'll start. I should preface this by saying I have generalized anxiety and social anxiety. I hate getting my hair cut. I think this stems from being embarrassed by a hairdresser when I was little and had headlice once.  

TL;DR down the bottom  

My worst hairdressing experience happened earlier this year. I was new to the area and didn't know where to go. I'd let my hair grow out far too long for my liking (as usual) so I was desperate for a cut.  

I chose a place that was nice looking without being over-the-top fancypants. The hairdresser was male and very outspoken. I told him exactly what I wanted: much shorter so I didn't have to tie it up for work, more layering etc etc. He didn't agree. His exact words were ""I know what looks best on women"". Yeah right asshole, you know what **you** like on women. He told me what he would do - he used fancy terminology but basically we was going to trim the ends and do a tiny bit of shaping around the face. I tried to argue with him but he was adamant.  

It was at that point that I should have walked out, but I couldn't make myself. I was so angry - at both him and myself. I hated myself for not being able to stand up to this douche.  

So I sit there while he gives me a 30 minute shampoo/head massage, ten minute haircut (trim) and 40 minute styling that I will never be able to recreate. I'm fuming the whole time and just want to get out of there. Cost me 130 bloody dollars. Sure my hair looked nicely styled but it was *not what I wanted. At all.*  

TL;DR: Sexist dickhead hairdresser wouldn't listen to what I wanted, was too scared to walk out, paid $130 for something I didn't want.  

As for the tips, I don't really know any, that's why I'm asking you! I always freeze up at hairdressers and don't know what to ask for/tell them.",,False,,t5_2t857,True,,,True,t3_nfww3,http://www.reddit.com/r/femmit/comments/nfww3/srs_questions_about_haircuts_no_pictures_i_promise/,

* Just a hint: Many of the comments in the other post stated that they wanted something understated and simple, not a 2X-style purple explosion, so you might want to keep that in mind.

So who would be interested in having user flair? Any ideas as to what we could use as flair? Symbols/icons/text? 

AbbyMoriah suggested using the different gender symbols such as [these](http://i206.photobucket.com/albums/bb171/green734/gendglyphssmall.jpg). There are also [LGBTQ symbols](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_symbols) that would work.

I'm a university TA for a class on individual sustainability. I've designed a thought-provoking assignment for my students to get them to start reflecting on the cultural construction of gender. 

Phase 1 and 2 have them conducting a series of self reflections, interviews and even some ""people watching"" to observe gender. Ideally, the third and final step would have them go out either taking on a new gender (drag) or taking on an alternate sexual orientation (i.e holding hands, kissing in public, etc...) This would ultimately allow them to truly experience what its like to be in the others' shoes. However, since this is not a 'Gender &amp; Sexuality' class, I feel uncomfortable commissioning a drag assignment.
