Hey guys, I'm a (not that well) known Let's Player that's probably about t' go full time into it. I told myself I wouldn't do it until profits from YouTube were able t' pay for the PC needed.

...Well, I think they have.

I'm sorry if this is a very noob post, but one of my main problems is picking/choosing even where t' start stuff. And the choices in a PC? Well...I'm completely stumped. So please forgive this feeble brain and help a guy out, will ya?

 * What will you be doing with this PC? Gaming? Photoshop? Web browsing? etc. If you need a Workstation, be specific on the programs you'll be using.

- This will be Gaming, Game recording and Rendering.  I mainly use FRAPS and Audacity for recording, usually play Minecraft for LP's and heavily modded versions of it that can get resource intensive.  Outside of that I would like to do newer games of course, and I will be doing a lot of web based ones.  I currently render usin' Sony Vegas Movie Studio 11.

 * What is your maximum preferred budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?

- I've got about $2,000
 
 * When do you plan on building/buying the PC? (note: if you're planning on buying more than 2 weeks from now, it's very much recommended you wait and come back then, to ensure you get the most recent and accurate price data)

- ASAP

 * What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? ""Everything"" is not specific enough. Just the tower? Operating System? Keyboard, mouse, monitor, speakers/headset, WiFi adapter, etc?

- Tower and all inside it, coolant system, main monitor, keyboard, mouse, decent mic.  Also need an OS.

 * Which country will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in the US, are you near a Microcenter store?

- US, upstate New York (close to Rochester)

 * If reusing any parts, what parts will you be reusing? Please be especially specific about the power supply. List make and model. If you have a monitor, list the size/resolution.

- very little.  Old computer will remain family used.  Will have 2 extra monitors (can't get access to info atm, but probably 24"" &amp; 27"" flat screens), but plan on new one for main.  Also have one external 2TB HD for raw vid storage.

 * Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line?

- I don't intend to overclock right away, but down the line if it's needed, I guess it's an option.

 * If there's any specific features you want/need from the rig, please list them. Examples might include rear and/or front-panel USB 3.0, a RAID setup, etc.

- Wifi access, front USB sounds good...um...yeah, I have no idea what else I'd need.

 * Do you already have a legit and reusable/transferable OS key/license? If yes, what OS? Is it 32bit or 64bit?

- I probably do, no idea where it is and don't want it...it's for XP (which, if ya look at it, looks like a guy squinting while raspberryin' ya).

 * Extra info or specifics:  

- When buying a rabbit, be sure to check it's paws for the mark of the beats.

1347203438.0,68,self.buildapcforme,zlqre,[$300 Max] Can you help me build the cheapest possible computer for my best friends (girl) birthday that can play some of the following?,84,16,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcforme/comments/zlqre/300_max_can_you_help_me_build_the_cheapest/,"I have only ever built a computer one time with help from a friend, however, seeing as Im trying to build the cheapest possible computer I dont think I am that skilled so help would be appreciated.

I am willing to help as much as possible, I don't want to leave this entirely up to you because that would be a douche move, so ask me questions as needed and ill do my best to help. I will probably also learn a bunch from this.


**Some back-story**

As the title states its going to be a birthday gift, something shes always wanted but never had the money for and I would like to surprise her with this.

Basically my friend (girl) loves to play video games, the problem is that she only has a generic laptop for her college classes and usually ends up using my computer to play the games she wants to play. I am perfectly fine with this, however, sometimes we would like to play a game together but are unable to because her laptop cant handle anything. 

As we are both college students, i do not have that much money so im trying to buy the cheapest possible computer for her, just for gaming (not intense gaming) 

____
**Example Games** ---- **Graphic quality** (around 35 frames on med. would be nice, but not a requirement)

Guild Wars 2 ------------- Low - Med

Counter Strike: GO ------- Low - Med

Portal 2 ----------------- Low - Med

Left 4 Dead ------------- Low - Med

*These are just approximates, Im just trying to give you an idea on the quality of games it will probably be playing. Guild Wars 2 would be the top played game on it.*


**Needed Parts** (The stuff I dont have)

* Case (probably looking at a mid/small tower? I could be wrong?)
* PSU
* Motherboard
* Processor
* Graphics Card 
* Ram
* HDD (at least 100gb ""I can upgrade it later"")

*I don't care about brand so long as they work together, cheap as possible is the goal*

**Un-needed parts** (parts I have and dont want included in the build)

* Monitor
* Mouse
* Keyboard
* Speakers
* Optical-Drive

___

I think thats it, so thank you so much to anyone who can help me with this. I am hoping to learn a bunch from this so that I wont need much help int he future. It would mean a lot to myself, and my friend in a couple weeks.

**Edit:** Not sure why this is already downvoted, so if I did something wrong in the title/body please tell me so I can fix it. Or if its something else, please tell me what?

1366855766.0,63,self.buildapcforme,1d1zll,[Mod Post] We need to talk about high end build-request contributions.,70,7,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcforme/comments/1d1zll/mod_post_we_need_to_talk_about_high_end/,"Seems like any time a user comes in requesting anything over ~$2000, people kind of lose their minds a bit. 

I know it's fun to put together 'dream builds' at ridiculous budgets, and you all want to show them off, but these are real people requesting these builds, and it's not a place to just lose your mind going completely over the top.

**I'll reiterate again**: *if you're not experienced with a given part level, don't post a build.*

For instance, yesterday we had a build request for a $5000 rig for an Australian builder. Of course the caveat here is that he was planning on building in November, but just wanted some help planning. Totally doable, but more in a discussion manner, not a just a build list manner.

One user, our newest Approved Contributor, Australian /u/Sweepingmonsoon did a fantastic job here.

The problem of course is with the other 4 users who decided to post up builds. Not *one* of them was in Australian Dollars. Every single one was from the US PCPartPicker. 

The OP in that post requested 2560x1440 gaming. That's all well and good, but only a single user followed that. One posted a build with 2x 1920x1200 monitors. Another with no monitor, and another with 3x 2560x1440 monitors.

3/4 builds were using overpriced and slow Caviar Blacks (pretty much a giveaway for those who are following hearsay, instead of looking at modern benchmarks and reviews). 

##TL;DR

Large-budget build requests are not your fantasy playground. Don't overestimate your knowledge, and remember that all of the subreddit rules still apply to those posts just as much as the $500 budget machine posts.",,False,self,t5_2tjcr,False,,,True,t3_1d1zll,http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcforme/comments/1d1zll/mod_post_we_need_to_talk_about_high_end/,moderator

There is my comparisson of their ""high end"" and low end Alienware builds and the very very clear proof that they are in no way a good idea to purchase and in fact are just ripping you off. Custom PC building is easy and while it may require a little bit of your time will save you headaches and money in the long run. Not to mention if your truly terrified of building it yourself NCIX has a $50 building fee as do many other pc shops and even including that fee the custom route is still a far better one to go.

Gaming? Photoshop? Web browsing? 

Graphic intensive games (e.i BF3, Tomb Raider, and Bioshock Infinite) but I am heavy into Roosterteeth for videos, facebook (no games, just browsing)

&gt;What is your maximum preferred budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?

$900 would be optimal but I am willing to do a little extra for rebates.

&gt;When do you plan on building/buying the PC?

ASAP, the laptop I'm typing this one is going into cardiac arrest as we speak.

&gt;What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? 

If worst comes to worst, I can use my HD TV for a monitor but I don't have anything other than a logitech wireless mouse and turtle beaches.

&gt;Which country will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in the US, are you near a Microcenter store?

I am in Minnesota but located in the sticks 7 hours from the twin cities.

&gt;If reusing any parts, what parts will you be reusing?

All I have for a monitor is a Vizio HDTV 47"". Prefer a new monitor.

&gt;Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?

I don't know what that is but I would probably find a way to do it if it's going to make it better.

&gt;If there's any specific features you want/need from the rig, please list them. Examples might include rear and/or front-panel USB 3.0, a RAID setup, etc.

A couple USB 3.0s wouldn't hurt anyone.

&gt;Do you have any specific case/tower preferences such as a window or LEDs, or do you have a preference for low-noise components?

I'm like it not to be seen or heard but to be the invisible powerhouse that guides me through the night. That dark figure that propels me into different worlds and wows me in ways my ex's (Xbox/PS4) could not.

&gt;Do you already have a legit and reusable/transferable OS key/license? If yes, what OS?

I would like to try Windows 8 but I'm up for any suggestions.

&gt;Extra info or specifics:

I will be upgrading as much as possible over the years so the cost is just to get the computer up and running.

1369500083.0,33,self.buildapcforme,1f1abq,[Mod Post] Welcome to all of our new subscribers!,34,1,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcforme/comments/1f1abq/mod_post_welcome_to_all_of_our_new_subscribers/,"Well, it seems just yesterday we were celebrating 5k subscribers... and now we're nearly at 7,500! This is awesome!

But with subreddit growth comes subreddit growing pains. Increasingly we're seeing many build requests failing to follow the request guidelines, any many contributors posting builds that ignore those rules as well. 

Due to the increased load, we mods have decided to add /u/SweepingMonsoon and /u/mc_nibbles to the mod team in the new Quality Officer position. Their job is to monitor posts and comments for rule compliance and general quality. Those who have been ignoring the sidebar will find themselves warned, and eventually banned if they continue.

These measures have always been an attempt to keep the quality of this subreddit as high as can be. The first real rule we had was for contributors to *not make assumptions*, and that still stands today as one of the primary rules. To aid in that we added any easy to follow set of questions for build requesters to fill out in order to provide as much of the required information as possible. When both rulesets are being followed, we get high quality all around. When one or the other (or both) are ignored, quality drops back to where it was a year ago.

Even with all of the questions though, some specifics sometimes get missed. Because of that, before posting a build you will almost always need to post a comment asking for clarification on a few things first. Even with that, when you do post a build, don't just post the markup and leave. Add in some explanations or justifications for what you've put in the build. This ends up being both informative to the OP, as well as anyone coming along looking to critique it. [As an example of what I mean by explaining stuff](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcforme/comments/1cp1uq/1100_high_ram_gaming_casual_pc/c9ix3e8).

To combat this we are again going to re-design the sidebar in order to put the rules front and center, with some additional clarifications that have slowly shown themselves to be needed.

Sorry for a bit of a wall of text, but thanks to anyone who read the whole thing!

And thank you to all of the contributors taking the time our of their days to post high quality builds!

Of course back then, I never imagined that /r/buildapcforme would be so successful. I even said in the sidebar that this community was created as a joke.

Little did I know that a year later this subreddit would have grown to an awesome community where we are genuinely helping people. This of course wouldn’t have been possible without a team of very dedicated mods who truly care about what they do.

You may also notice that recently we have implemented a new theme and this is thanks to the hard work of karmapopsicle.

Also to note is the ever improving cookie cutter build which we hope makes it easier for new builders.

**So a tremendous thank you to superrandomguy, karmapopsicle &amp; to all the contributors.**

*****************
As some of you long-time subscribers may have noticed, this subreddit has grown immensely in the past year. Hard to believe that we've gone from 243 unique visitors and 1,205 page views in the entire month of April 2012, to 32,681 unique and 201,314 page views in January 2013!

With higher numbers though, comes more contributors. Some quite experienced and some not so experienced but eager to learn. Of course with the numbers of new contributors coming in every day, we've got many popping in from a link over on /r/buildapc, and going right into posting builds. The problem here is that many new contributors are failing to first read through the sidebar, and as such, are posting builds left right and centre that don't meet either the posters or the subreddit's requirements, and simply clutter up request pages.

As such, we've decided to remove user editable flair and in its place implement an ""Approved Contributor"" tag system that contributors may apply for.

The application process will be relatively simple.

Send us a message indicating that you would like Approved Contributor status. In this post, you must write out a 'pledge' in the first person summarizing the Guidelines for Contributors in the sidebar, as well as the rules. It should look something like this:

*Hello, I would like to apply for Approved Contributor status.*


*I, ____________, pledge to follow the rules and guidelines for this subreddit. I will slowly and carefully read through builds, and will request more info from the OP when insufficient info has been provided. I will not make assumptions about needed parts. I will not assume a builder is looking for an overclocking rig. [etc, etc]*


*Signed, ____________.*

After receiving this, we will reply back to you with a synthetic build request. This build request may be anything from a basic office machine, to a gaming machine, to a media machine. Once we receive your reply(s), we will decide whether to grant you Approved Contributor status, and may offer up some constructive criticism.
**************************
Alright, now that the serious stuff has been dealt with, let's get on to some fun shall we?

Up for grabs is a Steam game $15 or less of your choice, courtesy of your mods. Winner will be chosen by the mods. Bonus points for originality, cool features, interesting (and well justified) part choices, etc.

The challenge is as follows:

* Purpose of the build: Pure gaming machine.

* The country the parts will be purchased in: US - not near a Microcenter.

* Budget: $2000 maximum before rebates.

* What you need included in your budget: Everything. Tower, monitor(s), keyboard, mouse.

* Whether you would prefer a stock build or an overclocking build: Overclocking build.

* Extra info: Please offer up a short explanation for your part choices.

This contest will run for 24 hours from the time of this post.

Have fun and a massive thank you to all of you!

From all the mods @ /r/buildapcforme

1348518845.0,29,self.buildapcforme,10esat,Not impressed with Cookie Cutter builds.  Can we discuss this subs purpose?,36,7,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcforme/comments/10esat/not_impressed_with_cookie_cutter_builds_can_we/,"r/buildapcforme is consistently getting referred to in r/buildapc.  I for one think that adding a step for people that are not informed, is a bad idea.....but maybe we can make that step as easy as possible and refer them directly to a build in this sub....instead of this sub in general.  

I purpose a generic copy and paste system for 11 builds.  Two vanilla builds for surfing, facebook, etc (Generic PS usage).  Two Vanilla builds for HTPC. Three vanilla builds for Productivity.  Four vanilla builds for Gaming.  Obviously the information posted here is a starting point, and tweaks need to be made to the actual build sections.

We should Iron out the details, and then seeing as how we are all nerds at heart that check Anandtech, Tomshardware, Bit-tech, Guru3d and other sites on a daily basis......we then update when anything significant happens.

The builds in the side bar are cookie cutter builds.  I think its great that people are wanting to help out.  But throwing up a price point with generic parts that have very little if any upgrade path is not what this sub should be about.  

   **The Problem**

We want people to not just Build a PC once, but learn how easy it is and do it from now on.  Recommending crappy cases, or PSUs with no upgrade path is a bad idea.  Single module Ram on a Dual channel motherboard?  **You have PSUs listed here at 350 watts and 1 6pin connector with a 6850 that requires 2 6pin connectors and recommends 500 watts.** I appreciate the attempt at having something for people to start with, but this is just bad.

.

--------------------------

.


**2 Generic Builds** (Best for parents, grandparents, or people not tech savy to surf the net and skype.  Both builds do not include Windows (add $99).
$300 and $500

**2 HTPC Builds** (Best for space saving layout with low noise parts.  We might want to include recommended Software (XBMC) or recommended Tuner cards) $400-$500

**3 Productivity Builds**  (Best for Photoshop, AutoCAD, After Effects, or other heavy uses.  These should all include a recommendation on a monitor.)
$600-$900-$1200

**4 Gaming Builds** (Obviously for gaming.  Best way to break this down is desired gaming potential. ) 

$400  (Medium settings at 720p for modern games.......maybe.  Indie game build).

$600 (Portal, TF2, CSGO, Modern games on Medium/High settings at 1680x1050).

$800 (Modern Games on High settings at 1920x1080).

$1100 (Max Modern games with minimum frame rates of 30FPS and Average frame rates in 50-60).


--------------------


Given that we can assume that everyone coming here will have no real knowledge of building a PC I think 3 things should be kept in mind for EVERY build.  


* Every build should include a high quality or easy to use case.  

* Every build EXCEPT the most expensive should avoid overclocking.  

* Every build should consider upgrade potential.

Obviously the case is the best investment.  It can be used for years, and should not wear out through normal usage.  It isn't worth saving $20 on a case (usually), as most first time builders get easily frustrated by lack of room, sharp edges, and general shoddiness of the end result.

Overclocking should only be on the most expensive builds such as the 900 and 1200 Productivity build and the 1100 Gaming build.  Assuming that most users posting in here are completely new to building a pc, it can be a nerve racking experience no matter how easy it has become.  On top of that, in gaming you won't hit a CPU bottle neck with an i5 processor before you hit a bottle neck on the GPU.

Gaming? Photoshop? Web browsing? etc. If you need a Workstation, be specific on the programs you'll be using. Try to list as many games/applications that you'll be using as you can, as well as your performance goals for those programs.

Primarily gaming. I'd like to be able to run Steam games on medium-to-high graphics, such as: Planetside 2, Blacklight: Retribution, Borderlands 2, Battlefield 3 (maybe 4 on this if possible), and Sleeping Dogs. I also play League of Legends and Minecraft, but I'm not too worried about FPS intensity for those.

I've also been curious about working with the Cockos Reaper DAW, but I don't know how much that would affect the price/performance. I would imagine it still working well enough to run it fine on a gaming pc.

&gt;What is your maximum preferred budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?

I'd like it to stay in the $600-700(max) range since that's what this Alienware costs for comparison.

&gt;When do you plan on building/buying the PC? (note: if you're planning on buying more than 2 weeks from now, it's very much recommended you wait and come back then, to ensure you get the most recent and accurate price data)

Within the next couple of days. It's really whenever I can get one put together, which I would like as soon as I can.

&gt;What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? ""Everything"" is not specific enough. Tower, Operating System, peripherals like the keyboard, mouse, and monitor(s), wifi adapter, speakers/headphones, etc. are all relevant.

The only thing I'll need out of those listed in that example are a new OS (pref Win7) since I'm pretty sure this license is not reusable.

&gt;Which country will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in the US, are you near a Microcenter store?

US, no Microcenter nearby.

&gt;If reusing any parts, what parts will you be reusing? Please be especially specific about the power supply. List make and model. If you have a monitor, list the size/resolution.

Reusing two monitors, both are 19"" 1280x1024. I really have no idea what my power supply is or how to check it.

&gt;Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?

I honestly am not sure what overclocking is or how to do it. :/ I've heard it's useful though for high intensity graphics.

&gt;If there's any specific features you want/need from the rig, please list them. Examples might include rear and/or front-panel USB 3.0, a RAID setup, etc.

Front and rear USB at the least for me is needed. I can't think of much else at the moment though that could be useful on the case.

&gt;Do you have any specific case/tower preferences such as a window or LEDs, or do you have a preference for low-noise components?

No specifics. A low-noise could be nice, but I can always work around it if it isn't.

&gt;Do you already have a legit and reusable/transferable OS key/license? If yes, what OS?

Ordering parts within 2 weeks.

&gt;What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? 

SSD to boot from, install programs, bare SSD to act as a scratch disk, large capacity HDD's, Blu-ray burner for archiving, RAM, lots of RAM (64GB or more), IEEE 1394 for tethering Medium Format cameras, USB 3.0 for high speed data transfer to external drives, Windows 7 with the ability to run Mac OS X for people who refuse to learn how to use Windows.

&gt;Which country will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in the US, are you near a Microcenter store?

The US; Utah to be specific.

&gt;If reusing any parts, what parts will you be reusing? Please be especially specific about the power supply. 

The only things I have purchased are mouse and keyboard.

&gt;Will you be overclocking? 

Only if I need to.

&gt;If there's any specific features you want/need from the rig, please list them. Examples might include rear and/or front-panel USB 3.0, a RAID setup, etc.

Front panel USB 3.0 is a must, front IEEE 1394 would be nice also, the case can be no wider than 12.5""

&gt;Do you have any specific case/tower preferences such as a window or LEDs, or do you have a preference for low-noise components?

I would prefer a low-key black case without a side window, aluminum is again, mandatory, and NO WIDER THAN 12.5""

I've made the decision to just invest in building a gaming PC. I've LONG been a console gamer.
I work in the IT field, but don't know enough about the constantly upgraded video cards that seem to be released every week to build a machine.

Considering the price tag of an Xbox One I'd just rather invest into something like this, could some of you help me build a great gaming PC? I'm not sure how much to put towards a budget.


I'd like to build a machine where I can play a lot of the popular games now on excellent settings as well as setting myself up for equal success with the games releasing with the new generation of games about to come out as well.
Any help and suggestions would be appreciated.
So far, I imagine an i7 would be highly suggested. The only place I really know about shopping online is Newegg, I also know they do combo part deals like MOBO's and processords, etc.

I'd like to have it ordered and built my the end of July.

Familiar with what overclocking is, I highly doubt I'll be doing it.

This post is specifically for build suggestions, [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcforme/comments/1442qb/mod_post_changes_to_the_cookie_cutter_builds_and/) one is specifically for category/layout suggestions.

Hey guys,

We've been discussing the cookie cutter builds a lot recently, and as stated in [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcforme/comments/1442qb/mod_post_changes_to_the_cookie_cutter_builds_and/) thread, we are going to make a post every two weeks for you guys' input on how we should update the builds. This is the first one. We will be using the categories submitted by /u/karmapopsicle in [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcforme/comments/142f16/can_we_discuss_the_cookie_cutters_for_a_minute/c79ajjz) comment. If you feel that we should have different categories, or maybe more of them, just post in the first thread that I linked on what you think they should be. So, here are the categories:

Basic builds:

* $250
* $350
* $450

Non-overclocking gaming builds:

* $400
* $500
* $600
* $700
* $800
* $900
* $1000
* $1100
* $1200

Overclocking gaming builds:

* $600
* $700
* $800
* $900
* $1000
* $1100
* $1200

Media/creative + gaming builds:

* $500
* $600
* $700
* $800
* $900
* $1000
* $1100
* $1200

If your budget is above this price point, then we suggest making a post as most people at that price range are going to want a lot of different things. In these categories, please do not suggest multi-GPU builds, as those are not needed at these price ranges, and if you have a lot of monitors and want a gaming build made for gaming across all those monitors, then you should be making a post anyway, as those are pretty special builds, most people are not going to be doing that.

So, it would be great if everyone would suggest something for the specific categories and price points, and whatever seems to be agreed upon the most for each will be chosen and put into the sidebar.

When do you plan on building/buying the PC?
ASAP
What, exactly, do you need included in the budget?
Tower, internal parts, keyboard, mouse (No sound system), Dual Monitor. Case cooler etc... I guess everything except external speakers.

US. I'm in Los Angeles, so I'm not sure if there is a Microcenter here.
If reusing any parts, what parts will you be reusing?
Not reusuing
Will you be overclocking?
Not sure yet, possibly if it's worth it.

I just wanted to say that because I am not a common visitor of this sub-reddit. Today I have skimmed through probably around 10 build requests and the vast majority of the CPU's chosen in these requests happened to be either the i5 3570k or the haswell i5 4670k. And when it wasn't them too it was their locked counterpart. There were a few AMD CPU's mentioned like the Athlon II or the fx-6300 but they were for the budget end builds. Sadly I think people completely rule out the FX-8350. I'm not saying the Intel CPU's above are bad but I think the 8350 deserves some more recognition in the 700-1000$ price range. Also Tek Syndicate made a video [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eu8Sekdb-IE) showing how if streaming is in your interest then the AMD CPU outshines the 4-core processors by Intel. Also the FX-8350 is at a lower price point so that is something to keep in mind as well. I admit the Intel CPU's tend to do better as far as gaming is concerned and the Intel CPU's are still great for streaming but I just wished that people would consider the AMD card more often!

I'm hoping to keep my initial build price around $500 Canadian/American(I'm close enough to the border) and I'm planning to build around upgrade ability. I have about a dozen games I simply cannot play(arkham Asylum, Crysis 3, Max Payne 3, Far Cry 3 and Steam summer sale). I would like to start with a machine good enough to play these and build towards med-high settings for future games over the next 3 years and replace around 5. I would like 1080 but can easily step down. I have a monitor, tv and other accessories.


My plan at the moment is to build the PC into the bottom drawer of an old wooden desk I have. It's a fairly classic piece handmade in the 20's so I want to preserve it as much as possible and aim to have as clear a desktop as possible. One drawer needs the bottom panel remade so I will be working from that to build standoffs and run cable management as I see fit.


Questions -
Will this be ESD safe with the drawer being opened and closed?


Is it worth building low end haswell now and upgrading later? From my reading this seems no.


I have the chance to get an i7 2700k for about 200$ from a friend, is that acceptable for the next 3 or so years? Are there any further upgrades for that socket?
A board with Thunderbolt would be a huge plus(I will still have tons of apple stuff) but is nowhere near necessary.

I have no particular allegiance to Intel over AMD but do not know AMD's lineup at all. 


That needs a TL;DR

$500CAD

No case or display needed

Mainly shooter games and media.

Can sacrifice 1080

Needs to be upgradeable

Is i7 2700k worth 200$ CAD?

Thunderbolt optional.

ok, ok..SimCity I know..LOL.
The current PC running these 3 ladies is nearing 2 years old..and its time to get crazy with a new build. The original builder is in Canada and has left the networking company we employ. This setup is in Geneva, and I am an American who cant speakie any French. Worse, I have never built a PC before. I do feel that I have done a good job maintaining this current monster,.but I am ready to learn more, and with your help, build something amazing.

&gt;If there's any specific features you want/need from the rig, please list them. I need at least 10 USB ports 2.0/3.0/4.0 whatever,.I have steering systems, pedals, motion actuators, shifters,.so as many as we can pack into this the better.

&gt;Will you be overclocking?
yes,.down the line.

&gt;Which country will you be purchasing the parts in? it matters not,.. If its available to purchase on the planet earth, we will buy it.

&gt;What is your maximum preferred budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?
So, the screens cost about $21k,.so the budget for the PC,.shoot the bloody moon!

&gt;What will you be doing with this PC? Gaming-
I need to run..
rFactor 1/2
Battlefield 3/4
SimCity(lol)
iracing
Project Cars
Assetto Corsa
NetKarPro
F1 2012/2013
I could go on,.but rFactor 1 on the low and Battlefield4 on the high. 5760x1080 as beautiful as we can make it, with high framerates.

I am going to pull the door off this old monster to get the motherboard specs..but here's what I know.
i7-2600k
x2 6990's
8gigs corsair Vengance(no idea on cas or channels)
2 pump/reservior
looks like 2 radiators
Corsair 800-D case(I think)
Even with all the driver issues with ATI and the 6990's its been pretty smooth until just recently with F1 2012. 

Maybe the case can be reused,.perhaps even the motherboard(if I can ever figure out how to find its model #).

At the end of the day I want something amazing.

If you had these screens what would you build to drive them?

Thanks in advance for any ideas.

A gaming computer for my girlfriend. I'd like it to be able to play most games (Skyrim, Don't starve, and Binding of Isaac to name a few) on high/ultra with out much issue for a fair amount of time. 

&gt;What is your maximum preferred budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?

About $1000 U.S. Can go a little bit over if it's well worth it.

&gt;When do you plan on building/buying the PC? (note: if you're planning on buying more than 2 weeks from now, it's very much recommended you wait and come back then, to ensure you get the most recent and accurate price data)

A.S.A.P

&gt;What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? ""Everything"" is not specific enough. Tower, Operating System, peripherals like the keyboard, mouse, and monitor(s), wifi adapter, speakers/headphones, etc. are all relevant.

Already have a monitor, keyboard, mouse, and storage HDD (500 gigs). Would like to have a SSD (around 250 gigs preferably but open to suggestions). We need a Mobo, good graphics card, CPU, power supply, case, ram (8 gigs I'm thinking), maybe a cpu cooler if you guys thing a stock one won't cut the mustard, and case fans given the case doesn't come with any. Also Win 7.

&gt;Which country will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in the US, are you near a Microcenter store?

The U.S. and not near Microcenter unfortunately :(

&gt;If reusing any parts, what parts will you be reusing? Please be especially specific about the power supply. List make and model. If you have a monitor, list the size/resolution.

It's a Samsung monitor, 26"", 1680x1050 resolution. (sounds like an odd number to me but that's what she has it set at. I'm sure you guys know better than I do though). And a 500gb (sorry not sure of the model but I'm 99% sure its not SATA) HDD for storage.

&gt;Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?

No overclocking on the CPU or GPU.

&gt;If there's any specific features you want/need from the rig, please list them. Examples might include rear and/or front-panel USB 3.0, a RAID setup, etc.

An SSD with decent storage space (I've had good experiences with the latest Samsung pro series but you guys let me know what you think please). USB 3 (front or back) would be nice but not mandatory. Won't be raid or anything. A case with good cable management features would be handy but I can manage otherwise if it's too over budget for one.

&gt;Do you have any specific case/tower preferences such as a window or LEDs, or do you have a preference for low-noise components?

She wants a ""nice"" case. What ever that means. I assume something clean looking with a clear window looking into it. I'll add LEDs at some point should she decide that's ""nice"" but not needed for the initial build. Low noise is not a huge concern but would prefer something that doesn't sound like a jet engine in our office.

&gt;Do you already have a legit and reusable/transferable OS key/license? If yes, what OS?

We'd need a new OS. Win 7 preferred. I'm thinking basic home edition but not sure of the benefits of other editions.

&gt;Extra info or specifics:

Nothing really to much. Just to recap we already have a monitor, mouse, keyboard, storage HDD, and headset. Would like a good SSD.

1362521167.0,17,self.buildapcforme,19qfdq,[Mod Post] Welcome to all of our new users! And some notes and tips.,31,14,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcforme/comments/19qfdq/mod_post_welcome_to_all_of_our_new_users_and_some/,"Hi everyone. As some of you may remember, it was just 22 days ago we celebrated 5k subscribers... and we're already at nearly 5,600!

It's great to see this subreddit thriving, but there are a couple things that need to be noted.

1) Read the rules and guidelines!
--
Fast growth means a large influx of new contributors coming in every day. Many of them popping in after seeing a link on /r/buildapc. This is both a blessing and a curse. Some come, read the sidebar, and quickly become valuable contributors. Others though simply assume this place is mostly anything goes as in /r/buildapc. This is not the case though. The rules and guidelines in the sidebar were placed there for a reason: to ensure consistency and makes things as smooth as possible. If you're new here, and you haven't read them, please take some time to thoroughly read through the whole thing. There will be some incoming CSS changes soon that will help direct people, but for now, it's up to you guys.

2) Quality over quantity!
--
In the past few months there have simply been too many cases of users showing up out of the blue, and posting dozens of builds a day, often with some major problems or issues. Every day I delete dozens of builds from non-Approved Contributors that break the guidelines, choose out of stock or just poor parts, and generally just carelessly thrown together, sloppy builds. Take your time. There's no point posting a dozen bad builds that just clutters up and confuses build requesters. Focus on making each build you put together as good as you possibly can make it. 

3) Don't post builds for uses/budgets you're unfamiliar with.
--
Every time someone requests a $2500+ build you'll find maybe one or two builds from people who know what they're doing, and a dozen other builds from people who really don't have any idea. Workstation posts with people recommending slightly modified gaming builds. Etc, etc, etc. Stick to helping people with what you know. If you don't know, lurk the thread and/or spend an hour researching what you need to know. May sound like a lot, but that research doesn't just go away when you're done with that build. Then next time you come across a similar request, you've already got a head-start.

------------------------------------------------------------

New process for becoming an Approved Contributor.
--
The Approved Contributor process is being streamlined in order to make it easier on everyone.

To apply for Approved Contributor flair, message the mods with the following:

* A pledge to follow the rules and guidelines, preferably with a short summary of them.

* A short bit about what kind of builds you've got knowledge and experience with, and what kind of requests you'll be helping to fulfill.

* A build of your choice that you think best showcases the knowledge you've got. Anything from a cheap HTPC to a multi-thousand-dollar multi-media workstation and anything in between. Include the relevant build request info that would warrant a rig like this, as well as a blurb on each component and why you chose it. 

-----------------------------------------------------------

Thanks for ready anyone and everyone, and happy building!

Gaming? Photoshop? Web browsing? etc. If you need a Workstation, be specific on the programs you'll be using. Try to list as many games/applications that you'll be using as you can, as well as your performance goals for those programs.

Primarily for playing games (Skyrim, Fallout, and D&amp;D Neverwinter would be ideal), as well as some word processing and perhaps dabble in some programming.

&gt;What is your maximum preferred budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?

Ideally, it would stay within the £600-800 range.

&gt;When do you plan on building/buying the PC? 

I probably won't be building until the summer, however I would like to make use of the Steam Summer Sales.

&gt;What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? ""Everything"" is not specific enough. Tower, Operating System, peripherals like the keyboard, mouse, and monitor(s), wifi adapter, speakers/headphones, etc. are all relevant.

I need an OS, a case, a Wi-Fi adapter, and a monitor. 

&gt;Which country will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in the US, are you near a Microcenter store?

I'm from the UK, so no Microcenters nearby.

&gt;If reusing any parts, what parts will you be reusing? Please be especially specific about the power supply. List make and model. If you have a monitor, list the size/resolution.

N/A

&gt;Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?

I will probably be overclocking down the line, probably just the CPU.

&gt;If there's any specific features you want/need from the rig, please list them. Examples might include rear and/or front-panel USB 3.0, a RAID setup, etc.

Nothing specific, no.
&gt;Do you have any specific case/tower preferences such as a window or LEDs, or do you have a preference for low-noise components?

Ideally it would be low-noise, however if this impacts greatly on price, never worry about it.

PLEASE READ MORE.",20,4,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcforme/comments/1apxay/challenge_buildplease_do_not_put_this_at_the_top/,"I am most certainly not saying this about the whole community of /r/buildapcforme. This community is amazing and if it weren't for you guys, I wouldn't have this amazing PC that I own now that I couldn't possibly be more proud of. But it seems to me that some members are slacking off. I have seen some members on here that hand out builds with huge bottlenecks. For example, just last week I saw a build on here with a AMD Phenom II and a Radion 7970 put together. I feel as though some people in this community just see the words, ""Gaming PC,"" and then make a completely random (and possibly defective build) with over priced GPUs. 

Okay so maybe I have over exaggerated that last part. But the part with the Phenom and 7970 was true. So for fun, I want to test some people's knowledge on computers. I want to see who can put together good quality builds on Pcpartpicker for the cheapest price. Rules and requirements below, please read on. One last thing before I say the rules/requirements of the build.

MODS: If you for whatever reason find this post acceptable, I do welcome you to delete this post. As I said earlier this post is just for fun. I will not actually be using the builds posted in the comments for an actual computer (unless the build is so amazing I can't help to say no to it). So, if this post doesn't go along with the rules of this subreddit, or is just unnecessary in your eyes, take it down. I'm sorry I bothered you, MODS.

Finally; Rules/Requirements.

* Good quality parts. Not some $20 MOBO that has nothing but 1 egg reviews on newegg. I have got one of those in a build request I have posted here, I knew it was a trap the second I saw it. The parts have to be good quality and the majority of the parts should at least have a 3.5 egg/star average rating. Good parts.
* As long as the parts are good make the build as cheap as possible, this will be a gaming rig.
* This build should be able to at least play games at 30 FPS on medium settings on all games at 1080p. Even Crysis 3 on its lowest settings. This will be an all around gaming computer. Don't forget about those CPU intensive games as well! (Even play some games on High or Max hopefully!)
* 8 gigs of ram with a CAS latency of at least 11 or lower. (Preferred CAS of 9 or lower though.)
* Ram will be DDR3 Memory clocked with a MINIMUM of at least 1600mhz. No DDR3 1333 RAM sticks.
* 500 Gigs of storage
* No peripherals, just tower.
* Lastly. EXPLAIN why you chose what you did. This is your chance to show off your knowledge and show why you're smarter than everyone. You're welcomed to challenge other posters on here as well! This is a learning experience! If you see something in a build you'd choose differently, then tell them. Maybe your way is better. Then that user will have a better understanding of why it is what you did. 

I think if this catches on, then this will be a fun, learning experience. 

Hell, maybe if I decide to I'll post my own build!

Anyways, Have fun guys!

It'll be used for Mainly gaming, steaming the internet (Facebook, Youtube, browsing Reddit, etc.), schoolwork, and minor programming. I plan on attempting to learn how to program in the near future by myself. I'm hoping to go to college to get a Masters Degree in Comp. Science.

I/It need(s):

*At least four cores in the CPU (I run multiple things at once, more cores would be nice.)

*All the Peripherals - Keyboard, Mice, Maybe even speakers and a monitor. I'm not sure about the speakers and the monitor though because If you buy a graphics card with an HDMI port couldn't you connect it to a tv and It'll have sound just fine? Or will you still need speakers? I've never connected a computer to a TV via HDMI. **If you can hook a computer to a TV via HDMI and have audio I do not need neither speakers nor a monitor.** But if you can't then I need both.

*To run games at at-least medium settings, at nice FPS, at but being able to play games higher than that would be very nice.

*At least 8 gigs of memory.

*A CD drive that's able to write songs to a CD to put in a car.

*A OS. Unless I can find myself a good way to get one for free. *Hint hint, nudge nudge.*

I understand I have a very tight and hard budget for everything I'd like to have. So everything following this is optional.

I'd like to have (I'm listing these in order of things I'd appreciate most to things I'd like to have least):

*A Graphics card that can support 2 monitors (but I'd be extremely grateful if it can support 3 monitors [I do know this is unrealistic for my budget, but it doesn't hurt to ask :)])

*A well sized HDD that'll hold plenty of games until I can upgrade. The reason why this is in wants is because somewhere in my house I have a computer that I might be able to salvage the HDD from.

*A windowed case!! I always was attracted to windowed cases. Not sexually of course. But air ventilation is still a wire priority

*THE MORE EXPANSION SLOTS THE BETTER

*The more future proof the better.

*A case that has nice wire management.

*A modular PSU.

*Be able to record gameplay and audio from a Mic I might be using in the future. 

*A SSD used mainly (and probably only) used for the OS and drivers I have.

*Onboard WIFI

*Onboard Blu-tooth (is there even such thing?)

*The PC case to be as small as possible while keeping good air ventilation.

*The more drive bays to go with that small PC the better.

*DDR3-1600 memory or above

*I'm an AMD fanboy, but when it comes down to it, who cares what the difference, between Intel and AMD is? A computer is a computer and if it does what you want to do, then you should appreciate it.

*A aftermarket CPU fan for OC. this is at the bottom of my list because I don't care much for it, I'm not really even interested in OC. But it'd be nice to have if I ever feel like I'd try it out one day.

I do understand some of that stuff is unreasonable for my price range. I understand I wont get some of that stuff either. Some of that was silly of me to ask, I know, it's not on my priority list. The reason for this build is to spend time with my brother, building a PC that can Play games, program, and surf the web. The other stuff is just luxury.

So I'm in charge of deciding what parts to buy for a custom server whose primary purpose is to host a SVN server, but which I would also like to be able to run virtual real-world simulation software (ray tracing stuff--this is going to be used for physics / engineering purposes).

I have nearly unlimited funds (into 10's of thousands), but have no desire to be wasteful in my spending. I've built several workstation / desktop PC's before (chose/purchased parts) but I'm really interested in making this be top-of-the-line and working first try.

Hoping to purchase the parts off of newegg (as I said, price really isn't an issue, so don't worry about pointing me to different sites that *might* offer better deals), so if you can give me a list of items that can be found on there, all the better! I'm absolutely opposed to not ordering online.


Here's what I'm looking for (beyond standard reliability):

* At least 2 physical CPU's; each of them, at least quad core. I've always thought more cores == better, but if someone can inform me otherwise, I'll listen. I've talked to some friends, the overall consensus seems to be Xeon.
* I'm thoroughly convinced more RAM = better. Cas latency minimized.
* Motherboard that can handle as many RAM sticks as possible (right?)
* There shouldn't be much of an issue with dedicated power (if you can justify multiple PSU's, then do so). Server doesn't need 100% uptime either. It'd definitely be a plus, but not absolutely necessary.
* Disk drive (DVD reader writer, I'm cool with whatever). *I see no reason to buy a blueray thing, so this is where the whole* **not wasteful** *thing comes in.*
* For the hard drive, I'm looking into getting some SSD's that mount directly onto the mobo via PCI-E cards. (Another consideration when picking the motherboard.) See [here](http://www.oczenterprise.com/interfaces/pci-express.html), for example.
* Extra hard drives, for more space. As I said before it's mainly going to serve as an SVN file server, so more space == better.

No worries about anything other than the tower.

&gt;What will you be doing with this PC? Gaming? Photoshop? Web browsing? etc.

My work often requires me to have Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, and Powerpoint (and Chrome, Skype, Synergy, etc) all open at the same time with some pretty heavy files. I'd like something that can handle this workload without breaking a sweat. I do some video and sound editing too.

I don't game on PC now, but I will be when the Oculus Rift comes out. Should I plan ahead and/or upgrade when it's released?

&gt;What is your maximum preferred budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?

3K. That's flexible too. I want power.

&gt;When do you plan on building/buying the PC? 

Soon (unless somebody has any reason why I should wait. I don't NEED it now, but I'm ready to buy.)

&gt;What, exactly, do you need included in the budget?

A tower, all the guts, 2-3 monitors (with a stand). I have a Wacom Cintiq I'll be adding too.

&gt;Which country will you be purchasing the parts in?

US and I do have a Microcenter near me

&gt;If reusing any parts, what parts will you be reusing? 

Nothing but the Cintiq, mouse, and keyboard

&gt;Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?

Doubt it. I don't know how.

&gt;Do you have any specific case/tower preferences such as a window or LEDs, or do you have a preference for low-noise components?

**What will you be doing with this PC?** Gaming. I've got a lot of games (Civ. 5, Deus Ex, Fallout: NV, Skyrim) that I want to play at or near their max. I've got a list of other games (Crysis 3, GTA V (fingers crossed), Any new iteration of Battlefield, Bioshock Infinite) that I'd like to play at high settings.

**What is your maximum preferred budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?** $1500.00 Canadian - however, if throwing a couple hundred more dollars at it will make the machine last longer or be more adaptable to additions in the future, that's fine so - absolute max - about $1750.00

**When do you plan on building/buying the PC?** I'd like to have everything ordered within the next two weeks.

**What, exactly, do you need included in the budget?** Tower, graphics card(s), motherboard, processor, operating system (win 7 or 8), keyboard, mouse, monitor, wifi adapter (would be nice), speakers, power supply, cooler, memory, storage, usb drive. I know the answer 'everything' is frowned upon here but, quite literally, everything.

**Which country will you be purchasing the parts in?** Canada. I'm in a fairly remote area of the prairies so my options to pay and pickup from bigger centres is pretty limited.

**If reusing any parts, what parts will you be reusing?** I don't plan on reusing any parts.

**Will you be overclocking?** I know very, very little about overclocking - but it is something that I would like to learn more about for the future. So, short answer: yes for both GPU/CPU.

**If there's any specific features you want/need from the rig, please list them.** It would be nice to have a SSD for quick access to things and a regular HD for storage.

**Do you have any specific case/tower preferences such as a window or LEDs, or do you have a preference for low-noise components?** No. Function over form.

What will you be doing with this PC? Gaming? Photoshop? Web browsing? 

Although I will use this PC for web browsing and word processor, I am building with gaming in mind.

What is your maximum preferred budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?

I don't want to go above $1,000 US, and would like to stay as close to $800 as possible.

When do you plan on building/buying the PC? 

I plan on doing this in the next week and a half or so.

What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? 

Everything but the mouse and keyboard.  I realize I'm not supposed to say ""everything"" but I'm new to this and not super technical.  But I need everything necessary to run these games, browse the web and use basic software like iTunes and micrsoft word/office, except for the mouse and keyboard.  So the tower and everything in it, but I'd like to go fairly cheap on the monitor.

&gt;Which country will you be purchasing the parts in?

I'm in the US.  Not sure if I'm near Microcenter; I'm in the North Chicago suburbs, if that helps.

If reusing any parts, what parts will you be reusing?

Only using my mouse and keyboard.

Will you be overclocking?

No, I don't plan on it.  I don't know enough about PCs to do it safely.  I don't want to ""rock the boat"" so to speak.

If there's any specific features you want/need from the rig, please list them. 

Nothing fancy.  I'd like to make it wireless internet accessible, however.  I do have a home gateway/router already, so I have a wireless setup.

Everything within the tower. The OS. I don't need a keyboard, mouse, monitor or anything else. Just the basic computer components.

I'm here to get your opinions on a gaming/streaming build. First I thought a little background was in order.  I'm 29 years old and just a year ago my life was in shambles.  I tried committing suicide and spent a month in a mental hospital.  After which I found myself homeless and with no direction in life.  ""What the fuck does any of this have to do with a gaming pc"" you are probably asking yourself right now.

  Well it's simple really this pc is a kind of a manifestation of how I've turned my life around for the better and how I've bounced back from adversity and beaten depression.  It may seem silly that a pc could mean that to anyone but that's what it means to me.

Now on to the tech stuff.

What I want: A kick ass gaming/streaming pc.  Something I can play a game at near 60fps on high to ultra quality and export a beautiful quality stream to twitch.  Also the ability to record gaming footage without significant performance hit to the game im playing for later editing. Render times never really bothered me all that much.  I usually use one 23"" monitor with a junk monitor on the side to watch stream chat or a movie or see what song is comming up next on my playlist.

What I already have: I'll be reusing my current keyboard, mouse, monitors, optical drive, and headset.

Budget: About 3k while I don't mind spending that much and I do like that ""holy shit"" factor I still understand that some shit is just too much money for very little to no return in performance.  Also I live in the u.s on the eastern seaboard in driving distance to a micro center and I've used newegg before.

I'd like to thank you all in advance for the help and hope you all have a awesome day

Now I have the money to make my own system, but my 7 year old knowledge of computer parts leaves me at a disadvantage.

I basically took a bunch of cookie cutters and builders, and came up with a basic idea of what I wanted. I changed the GPU to the ATI 7950 2GB, rather than ATI 7970 3GB, because it was $100 cheaper. Would the extra performance really be worth that much? I also don't think I would need more than a single HDD, as I have an external already for storing media. Should I spring for a SSD in that case or just a 7200RPM HDD? I also understand that the i5 is pretty much the CPU I need for gaming, but are there different models? I hear I need an IvyBridge i5, is that different than the 3350 in my build?

The cookie cutter setup had a Micro ATX motherboard, and a Mid ATX tower. If I were to shop around for a case, should I be looking at Micro ATX sizes, or Mid sizes? I rather prefer unnecessary lights. I put the Thermaltake case onto this build but it is sort of pricey. Would that one be loud? I was told a BitFenix Shinobi was the quiet option, but it didn't appear to have any kind of fans or openings or anything like that.

I need a monitor, and have no idea how to go about shopping for one. I only recently upgraded myself to an HDTV and it took plenty of research to find the perfect model for my desires, so if someone had a recommendation that would make things easier on me. Single monitor, nothing too big. I would say a 23""? Is that about normal? I don't know the size of the laptop I'm using right now. I also need a mouse and keyboard but I'm not picky about that unless someone has an outstanding recommendation

If I don't know about overclocking, basically don't buy under-powered parts and I don't have to worry about extra cooling? Or would it be worth worrying about? Surely the setup I have could be upgraded fairly easily if it needed to be?

&gt;**When do you plan on building/buying the PC?**

As soon as possible! My 5-year-old iMac isn't cutting it anymore.

That leaves me in awe because I've been trying to build a PC of my own (first build). Though, I find it very exhausting knowing how many options there are. Don't even get me started on the pros/cons I'd have to take into consideration for every piece. So, I decided to come here and get people to guide me through this whole process. That being said, thanks in advance to anyone that decides to help! 

I'm not looking for a high end computer or anything like that, I'm settling for a decent gaming computer that can play the games I want it to (which isn't many at this point because my current computer can't even handle something like Minecraft on Far but I play games like LoL, PoE or WoW) with a budget of about $1k - 1.2k USD. I hope to have it up and running as soon as possible, as I mentioned earlier I've been researching parts and have only complied a few parts. I'm building from scratch and need the whole enchilada. (Monitor/Mouse/Keyboard/OS/HDD/PSU/GPU/CPU/Mobo/Case/RAM/Optical Drive) 

Note:As far as mouse/keyboard go, I can cheap out on those if it helps in buying a better graphics card or anything that would help improve performance. 

These are the parts I picked out (which are completely open to any better suggestions): 

*CPU- Intel's i5-3570k

*MOBO- igabyte GA-Z77X-UD3H ATX LGA1155 Motherboard

I live in the US and know of a Frye's relatively close. I think I want to overclock in the future, I know it adds a performance boost but don't know at what cost. (e.g. more power needed?) I don't know much about the ""RAID"" setups but anything that would help improve the gaming experience helps.

Not that all of these things will be running at once normally, but that's what I am going to be asking out of this computer.

How often do the prices and hardware get updated? I've taken a look at them, and most of them actually come out slightly more expensive than the links say. There aren't any huge differences, but I did notice a bit. Also, how often do they get updated to root out obsolete or inferior parts?

Also, I'm mainly looking into non-overlocked builds, and I'm noticing that none of them have CPU coolers included. I know that CPUs do get extra hot when overclocked, but do they seriously not need dedicated coolers when they're not? Naturally I'll believe it if that's the case, but I feel like they'd still get pretty hot even when not overclocked. I guess it wouldn't surprise me if CPUs are designed to stay cool unless you overclock them, but I'm paranoid.

Hi All

I've looked through the (extensive) material here and it seems I might have a bit of an unusual and fun request.

I'm looking to build a research/gaming computer. I've been getting by with research on a MacBook Pro (Apple products are used more frequently in my field) and gaming on consoles, but I'd like to join the dark side. I'd like to build a PC with both OS X and Windows partitions for research and gaming.

What do I need for research? I run replicated simulations (e.g., do process A x 10,000) in Matlab and R and having multiple cores (or whatever) to spread these tasks would be very helpful. I also work with large datasets (e.g., 100,000's or 1,000,000's of data points) and need the ability to process this data efficiently. I don't need a massive hard drive, but I'm sitting at 400gb of data currently and could see the benefit of giving myself some breathing room. Other ""demanding"" programs I use frequently:  Photoshop, Illustrator, Final Cut Pro, and IE (I kid, I kid).

Other interests:  I'd love to transition from a beefy laptop to something a little more sleek because I travel frequently. Thus, I'd love to have the ability to remotely access my PC for basic tasks (e.g., file transfers, backups, setting up simulation runs or doing large calculations).

What do I need for gaming? I really would love to appreciate the aesthetics of my games because I've paid my dues (e.g., I had WoW and SC2 on 1-3 year old laptops in the past), but I don't need to max things out entirely. However, based on my research needs, I may not need a whole lot more to build a decent gaming rig.

Let me know if you have any questions and I'll get back to you as soon as possible!


&gt;What will you be doing with this PC? Gaming? Photoshop? Web browsing? etc. If you need a Workstation, be specific on the programs you'll be using. Try to list as many games/applications that you'll be using as you can, as well as your performance goals for those programs.

Please see above

&gt;What is your maximum preferred budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?

I'd like to keep the budget under $4,000, but I'm extremely flexible. Can you build a PC that fits the bill for $2,000? Great, thanks! Do you have a compelling argument for why I should build a $4,000 PC? Are you just wishing I had said the budget was $6,000 because I'd be missing out on something critical? I'll hear you out. 

&gt;When do you plan on building/buying the PC? (note: if you're planning on buying more than 2 weeks from now, it's very much recommended you wait and come back then, to ensure you get the most recent and accurate price data)

I'm ready to start buying components whenever. I'll start building in mid-August (or later if you can make a compelling argument for waiting for new components) and figured I'd give some lead time so that I could keep an eye out for good prices.

&gt;What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? ""Everything"" is not specific enough. Tower, Operating System, peripherals like the keyboard, mouse, and monitor(s), wifi adapter, speakers/headphones, etc. are all relevant.

The only components I already have are the monitor (24in Samsung), keyboard, and mouse. I'd be interested in hearing about your favorite ergonomic, mechanical keyboard though.

The build will be running Blender (with cycles which uses CUDA), 3ds Max, Rhino, SketchUp, and Adobe CS6 (including AE and Premiere). Occasionally I use V-ray with these programs.

I plan on rendering large images with this build ~ 6,000 x 4,000 px with high poly meshes and complex lighting/textures. Most of my animation work I will farm out to render street.

**What is your maximum preferred budget?**: $3,000 or less

**When do you plan on building/buying the PC?**: Next week!

**What, exactly, do you need included in the budget?**: I already have a monitor (for now, I'd like to get a Dell 30"" in the next year), and a mouse. I need everything else.

**Which country will you be purchasing the parts in?:** USA

**Do you have any specific case/tower preferences?**: I prefer the fractal R4 black case without the side window. I like the understated, silent style.

**Do you already have a legit OS key?**: Nope

Gaming? Photoshop? Web browsing? etc. If you need a Workstation, be specific on the programs you'll be using. Try to list as many games/applications that you'll be using as you can, as well as your performance goals for those programs.

My main use for this computer would be for recording and producing music. I would use programs like Cubase, Superior Drummer 2.0, as well as Sibelius 7. Primarily I want a computer that can easily handle many powerful plugins and have low latency audio. Also maybe some graphic designing.

&gt;What is your maximum preferred budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?

$1,000 is my absolute maximum.

&gt;When do you plan on building/buying the PC? (note: if you're planning on buying more than 2 weeks from now, it's very much recommended you wait and come back then, to ensure you get the most recent and accurate price data)

Within the next two weeks actually, but I could start getting parts immediately.

&gt;What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? ""Everything"" is not specific enough. Tower, Operating System, peripherals like the keyboard, mouse, and monitor(s), wifi adapter, speakers/headphones, etc. are all relevant.

I have the peripherals, it's really just the tower I need to work on. I would like to put Windows 7 on it (I don't like 8). Also a wi-fi adapter because my room is a bit of a distance from the router. And a CD drive (not sure if it comes with the case--does it?)

&gt;Which country will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in the US, are you near a Microcenter store?

The United States, near Los Angeles.

&gt;If reusing any parts, what parts will you be reusing? Please be especially specific about the power supply. List make and model. If you have a monitor, list the size/resolution.

I have a monitor, not sure what the resolution is, however I also have a moderately-sized HDTV that is 720p (Polaroid).

&gt;Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?

I don't think so. Also I don't game so graphics aren't *too* important for me.

&gt;If there's any specific features you want/need from the rig, please list them. Examples might include rear and/or front-panel USB 3.0, a RAID setup, etc.

A big HDD, I don't really think I need an SSD but if it fits in the budget I suppose why not. A bit of an odd request but one of my audio interfaces can only be connected by FireWire. 

&gt;Do you have any specific case/tower preferences such as a window or LEDs, or do you have a preference for low-noise components?

Nothing too fancy, but noise reduction would be a huge plus.

&gt;Do you already have a legit and reusable/transferable OS key/license? If yes, what OS?

No.

&gt; About 80% Gaming (mostly GPU demanding games such as Battlefield 3 ).

I'll also be playing a lot of games, take a look at my [Steam Library](http://steamcommunity.com/id/beast2363/games?tab=all) if that'll help.

&gt; Tower, OS (unless I can use a pre-installed version of Windows 8 in the new build, then I would go for Windows 7), Func MS-3 Mouse, (I would enjoy recommendations for keyboards, since I have been used to regular ""workstation"" ones), Wifi Adapter, An [ASUS VX238H 23-Inch Screen LED-lit Monitor](http://www.amazon.com/VX238H-23-Inch-Screen-LED-lit-Monitor/dp/B00ANKMNXO/ref=sr_sp-atf_title_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1371149838&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=VX238H).

&gt; USA, not that I know of. Will check around to be sure.

&gt; Probably my current Western Digital 1 TB HDD. Can't be too sure if it'll be compatible. 

* Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?

&gt; Hopefully sometime down the road; both GPU and CPU.

* If there's any specific features you want/need from the rig, please list them. Examples might include rear and/or front-panel USB 3.0, a RAID setup, etc.

&gt; Both rear and front USB 3.0 panels and a RAID setup would be dandy. 

* Do you have any specific case/tower preferences such as a window or LEDs, or do you have a preference for low-noise components?

&gt; The BitFenix Prodigy Case looks nice, but anything with a side panel and a sleek, modern look to it will do. 

* Do you already have a legit and reusable/transferable OS key/license? If yes, what OS?

&gt; I have a copy of Windows 8, but it was pre-installed onto my current HDD which I plan on using. 

* Extra info or specifics:

&gt; I'd also like to *maybe* install watercooling in the future, and also have a decent GPU which could possibly run in SLI or Crossfire mode.

Currently, I game on my late-2009 iMac running Windows through bootcamp and, while I can run a heck of a lot of games at pretty decent settings, I want more out of my PC - I don't need a rocket ship or anything, just a steady framerate on modern games like Dark Souls, Battlefield and the like. My current knowledge in parts ranges from ""wut"" to ""huh"" so I really have no idea what I'm doing. When I look at model numbers, it's almost as if I'm reading another language and I have no idea how it relates to performance. Since my friend and I are both looking to get into this together and our lack of knowledge concerning PC hardware is more-or-less equal, we were considering using this [iBuildPower thingy](http://www.walmart.com/ip/iBuyPower-Build-Your-Own-Gaming-Desktop-Bundle-Select-Case-Processor-Memory-Hard-Drive-and-more-with-Windows-8-Pro-Upgrade-Option/15374646) provided by Walmart. However, I've been reading guides and realized I could probably save a lot of money by building it myself. 

To cover all of the bases, I'll follow the request guidelines: 

* I plan to use this PC for 100% gaming and I very much want to get into streaming. Hopefully, I would stream games like Dark Souls/2, Dota 2, BF3/4 *butthatsprobablytooambitious* and pretty much anything else I'd end up playing. In addition to the livestreaming, I would like to edit these/create new videos and upload them to Youtube.

* Considering how much money the selected parts would come to using iBuyPower ($745), $700-800 would be my - hopefully - maximum budget. 

* Valve's Steambox is most definitely on my radar so I probably wait for more details regarding that before making a decision. Really, all I want is a basic guideline for building my own custom PC if the opportunity should arise. The earliest purchase date would most likely be after e3, assuming Valve details the Steambox by then. 

* I would be building from scratch and would need any and everything, internally-speaking. I already have some really great speakers, a 1920x1080 monitor and several headsets. However, I would need a keyboard and mouse set - nothing too crazy, just something that works. Wired or wireless doesn't matter, whichever you think is best. Out of personal preference, particularly raised keys would be best avoided (due to years of using an Apple-made keyboard) and a minimum of two side-buttons on the mouse would be appreciated. I also have a 500GB Seagate external HDD, if that means anything. 

* I'm from the US and live within an hour from the nearest Microcenter store. Would rather not have to travel and would prefer online shopping. I have Amazon Prime where applicable. 

* Not reusing any parts. I have an Acer 19"" 1920x108 LED display with one HDMI port and no internal speakers. 

* I have only a basic understanding of overclocking and have no desire to try at this time.

* As far as the case goes, I would like to lay it on its side and place my monitor on top (my current set up as far as my Xbox goes). As I said before, I would rather the keys have more in common with an Apple keyboard as far as depth goes and would prefer a decent, low-priced two-button mouse.

* I already have Windows 7 Home Premium, 32-bit. I have little understanding as far as what makes the 64-bit better but, as far as I'm aware, the 32-bit should be okay?

Last week the graphics card in my 6 year old gaming PC died. It had a good innings but I guess it was overdue. I'd come to terms with doing without for a while but as luck would have it I got a tax refund for £1000 a few days later. So here we are! Any help would be appreciated.  
  
&gt;What will you be doing with this PC? Gaming? Photoshop? Web browsing? etc. If you need a Workstation, be specific on the programs you'll be using. Try to list as many games/applications that you'll be using as you can, as well as your performance goals for those programs.  
  
Gaming (pretty much everything), Cubase, Audacity, Sibelius and similar programs, Unity3D and Visual Studio. Things like that.  
  
&gt;What is your maximum preferred budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?  
  
Max I can spend is £1000. If it comes out less than that it would be great but £1000 is fine.  
  
&gt;When do you plan on building/buying the PC? (note: if you're planning on buying more than 2 weeks from now, it's very much recommended you wait and come back then, to ensure you get the most recent and accurate price data)  
  
I'll be ordering ASAP.  
  
&gt;What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? ""Everything"" is not specific enough. Tower, Operating System, peripherals like the keyboard, mouse, and monitor(s), wifi adapter, speakers/headphones, etc. are all relevant.  
  
I already have the monitor, keyboard, mouse, speakers etc. I really just need the actual tower components and an OS. If I could get a second monitor and still be under £1000 without compromising the quality of the PC then that would be good. But isn't mandatory.  
  
&gt;Which country will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in the US, are you near a Microcenter store?  
  
I'm in the UK. 
  
&gt;If reusing any parts, what parts will you be reusing? Please be especially specific about the power supply. List make and model. If you have a monitor, list the size/resolution.  
  
Everything i've already got is 6 years old so I dont really want to reuse anything from inside the PC. The monitor is 22inches.  
  
&gt;Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?  
  
I'm open to suggestions on this.  
  
&gt;If there's any specific features you want/need from the rig, please list them. Examples might include rear and/or front-panel USB 3.0, a RAID setup, etc.  
  
Couple of USB ports at the front would be useful.  
  
&gt;Do you have any specific case/tower preferences such as a window or LEDs, or do you have a preference for low-noise components?  
  
As little light output as possible would be great. I'd like the case to look nice and all, but I don't need any flashy lights and windows. Low noise would be nice but not mandatory.

I play league of legends, and just a few other low end games. I watch a lot of netflix, and internet browsing. My needs aren't too high.

&gt;What is your maximum preferred budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?

Before? I'm not too experienced with the amount I should be expecting the rebates/shipping/taxes to be. I just know I want it hopefully under 300$, but I can go over 20ish$ if need be.

&gt;When do you plan on building/buying the PC? (note: if you're planning on buying more than 2 weeks from now, it's very much recommended you wait and come back then, to ensure you get the most recent and accurate price data)

ASAP.

&gt;What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? ""Everything"" is not specific enough. Tower, Operating System, peripherals like the keyboard, mouse, and monitor(s), wifi adapter, speakers/headphones, etc. are all relevant.

**Everything.** 

Kidding. I have all the peripherals, so just the computer is needed. 

&gt;If reusing any parts, what parts will you be reusing? Please be especially specific about the power supply. List make and model. If you have a monitor, list the size/resolution.

Not that I can think of for the tower, but I have a 21.5in monitor. 1920x1080.

&gt;Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?

Nope. Don't know how, willing to learn if need be.


Also, no specifics needed really, just want to play league and browse.


&gt;Do you already have a legit and reusable/transferable OS key/license? If yes, what OS?

Well, I have XP somewhere in the attic, but I really /should/ upgrade. 



Thanks for helping! Really, thanks. Let me know if there is anything else you need me to add.




Here is a setup my friend suggested. He's learning, so constructive criticism would be greaaat.

The PC itself of course, with a wifi adapter (i'll probably get my local store's homebrand one, costs just 15 euros)

The Netherlands

The one I was looking at in a shop was around 377£. But it had only 1TB storage and I did not like a couple of other parts, so there should not be any harm to look around.
I tried r/buildapc but got directed here. 
What say you? Can you help me out?

EDIT 1.
Hey. Sorry for disappearing, had to work. (13h Saturday shift) I guess Ill start with the sidebar as it was a quick post before work.
It will be a workstation. The only programs that will be used are PC DJ (a simple audio soft for playback and mixing) and a showcad artist (http://www.showcad.com/products.aspx)
My budget is 500 or under.
I want to buy it as soon as possible.
For the money I would like to get the tower and the OS.
Parts will be purchased in UK.
I am sorry I was not clear enough. Basically what we have right now is a tower that runs PC DJ trough a mixer (maybe someone knows if a soundcard would improve the quality). We have monitor as well. I think it is a 19`, and quite old, the resolution cant be above 720p. I have mouse and a keyboard. If this works out I will be buying extra monitor for the lighting as well. Right now the lights are controlled via lighting table, and we would like to move to digital. No we dont have DMX controller but again, if i can get a decent tower for reasonable price we will be getting one.

Gaming? Photoshop? Web browsing? etc. If you need a Workstation, be specific on the programs you'll be using.

Primarily a gaming PC. 

* What is your maximum preferred budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?

$2000-$2500.

* When do you plan on building/buying the PC?

May-June 2013. Will start looking at components now but aiming to build early May. No crazy hurry to get it done, as long as it gets done right!

* What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? ""Everything"" is not specific enough. Just the tower? Operating System? Keyboard, mouse, monitor, speakers/headset, WiFi adapter, etc?

Motherboard, graphics card, processor, memory, 1-2 TB hard drive (with a supplementary SSD HD), PSU, cooling if needed, sound card, headset. Am I missing anything? The only parts I don't require are a mouse/keyboard and monitor.

* Which country will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in the US, are you near a Microcenter store?

New Zealand.

* If reusing any parts, what parts will you be reusing? Please be especially specific about the power supply. List make and model. If you have a monitor, list the size/resolution.

Not reusing anything except monitor, keyboard/mouse and LAN cable.

* Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line?

If it is recommended, then yes I guess so. Down the line.

* If there's any specific features you want/need from the rig, please list them. Examples might include rear and/or front-panel USB 3.0, a RAID setup, etc.

SSD harddrive. 

* Do you already have a legit and reusable/transferable OS key/license? If yes, what OS? Is it 32bit or 64bit?

Yes, Windows 7 64 bit.

**Just to add to this, I am looking for a futureproof gaming rig. Obviously nothing is *really* futureproof but I want something which can play new and upcoming games maxed out with no problems for the next few years. I like nVidia video cards, Intel i7 (was looking at the 3930k but seems this could be a waste of money for gaming purposes? Or at least worse value for money than 3770k for example) and the rest isn't specified.

1365730161.0,12,self.buildapcforme,1c6e0n,[Mod Post 2: The Revengeancing] Results from the survey!,17,5,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcforme/comments/1c6e0n/mod_post_2_the_revengeancing_results_from_the/,"Alright, so lets first go over a summary of the survey results!

[Full imgur album of the results](http://imgur.com/a/JU5rJ).

Conclusion we can draw:

* The majority of users are occasional contributors who arrived within the past 3 months. This makes sense when compared to the subreddit statistics.

* It appears that most users haven't felt the need to apply for Flair, and instead just post as-is, even with the risk of deletion.

* Build request posts are generally still about the same quality they were before, with a few more users trending towards the slightly better/much better side.

* The rules for Build Requests appear to have pretty widespread approval, but only when properly utilized. This subreddit still has too many build requests being posted missing a large amount of information. Some users have suggested a few other criteria or sidebar modifications.

* Generally the moderation levels is about right, but with a sizeable number of users believing it could in fact be a bit stricter.

* The vast majority of users believe the rules for contributors are A-OK, with pretty much even numbers on either side.

* On the moderation style, it seems users want builds with incompatible or poor choices to be removed, and an about even number on either side of removing rule breaking builds sometimes without notice vs leaving them up but pointing out the rule violation. 

* A small segment of users would prefer the subreddit move into a *laissez-faire* style hands-off approach, rather than the more /r/askscience approach of simply cleaning out posts that break the rules.

* Many users want some kind of cookie cutter/build guide to be available again.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

So what kind of changes will we see from this?

* A few changes to the sidebar style and text. Boxes will be more delineated in colour, and there will be a new box right at the top clarifying that reading the sidebar rules is mandatory.

* I'm looking into some potential CSS changes in the stylesheet to hopefully enable use to have the build request questions default to a template in the submit post page. (Side note, any subscriber with CSS/reddit stylesheet experience... message me!)

* We're going to start relying more on *you* the subscribers and contributors on the ground level to help enforce the rules! When you see someone posting a build over budget, making large assumptions, picking poor parts, etc, *report* it, and *reply* pointing out those things.

* Builds with dangerous, incompatible, or just *really poor* choices will be removed, usually with a reply at least stating the reason(s).

* Builds that either break rules, or otherwise have some poor choices, but that have had a little more effort than just throwing something together and posting it without any questions, comments, or justification will be left up, and the violations will be pointed out.

* Repeat rule breakers will be given a few warnings, and then a temp ban, as has been happening for a while now. 

* We will look into starting the wiki, hopefully combining both a parts guide, and a logical-increments style part suggestion guide, all in one. We may reach out to some users to help manage this at some point, given we can now give partial moderator access to a bunch of things.

* We may reach out to a couple users in different timezones specifically for post moderation and rule enforcement.

* We may look into some way of making becoming an Approved Contributor more appealing, perhaps somehow bolstering that it means the user in question has been vetted by the mods.

I'm attending university right now and I need to buy a new computer. After a little bit of thought, I've decided what I want. Here are the bullet points...

* Professional and academia driven. Low to no gaming, if anything Minesweeper/Solitaire or zSNES. Graphics card should be for photo/video editing, not Crysis Frames-per-second.
* Will run... MATLAB, Spices, Circuit Sim/CAD programs, coding in C, Python, Java, Verilog/VDHL, some Assembly Language, Photoshop/Illustrator/GIMP, lots of web browsing and reading, possibly some sound recording/audio processing, TONS of word proccessing/office apps of course.
* FAST and MINIMALISTIC. Haven't decided on a distro yet, but the DE will probably be LXDE. I sort of like Uberstudent, but only sort of...
* No need to include a keyboard, I'll probably get a DAS Ultimate. The monitor doesn't need to be huge, but it does need to be sleek, fast and colorful. The mouse needs to be comfortable, ergonomic, sturdy and reasonably accurate, but I'd like to avoid a 10,000 button $150 gaming mouse.
* Sleek and motivating is the theme. No nonsense, down to business look and feel. Nothing frilly, no unnecessary indulgences.
* Yes, there will probably be a Windows partition.
* Under $1000 would be great, but I'm realistic. If there's a fantastic machine out there for $1500, I'd probably buy it.
* Country: USA, To be bought: Within 4 months, no starting parts, no overclocking.

I'm just trying to get an idea as to where to start. Thanks so, so, so, so much.

No promo prices included so pricing should stay accurate for a while.  SSD and Case are the only things that may be purchased with a better discount.

**CPU** - G630 is the cheapest ""good"" processor currently out.  A cheaper Celeron will only save you $10 and sacrifice quite a bit of performance.

**Motherboard**  This B75 mobo can support an i3/i5/i7 for future upgrades, as well as a dedicated graphics card if you need it in the future.  It also has USB 3.0 and SATA 6.0 (1).

**RAM**  2 Sticks of DDR3-1333 for Dual channel support.  4GB total.  No upgrade options due to 2 slot limitation, but considering 4GB is still holding as more than adequate, I think its a safe bet instead of 1 4GB stick.

**SSD** Why SSD instead of a HD.  Well you can get a 320GB 7200RPM drive for a bit cheaper, but honestly I think the benefits of this drive outweigh its lack of storage space.  After the Windows 7 install you should have roughly 70GB of space left.  My parents have tons of photos, but there are 2 reasons why I chose the SSD.  In the event of a fire, you can easily grab an external USB 3.0 HD and save your families memories.  Also with an SSD applying window's constant updates isn't a hassle.  The computer will install and reboot in 2 minutes, which means that keeping your computer up to date and safe is no longer a hassle (10 minute process). 70GB is plenty of room for most people's music collections and a few videos.

**Case** NZXT Source 210 Elite.  Has USB 3.0 port on front and thumb screws for easy installation.  It is also roomy enough and well built enough to keep around for a few more builds down the road.  Also has 2 fans, so for most builds you wont need to purchase an additional fan for cooling.

**PSU**  The Weakest choice here.  There are constantly 80 plus and 80 bronze certified 500 watt PSUs on sale for under $50.  Finding one without a discount is hard.  I would prefer something with 2 6pin cables instead of 1.  However this is a great unit and can support up to a 7770 later on.

**CPU** - I3 Ivy Bridge supports 1600 ram.

**Motherboard**  This H77 mobo can support an i3/i5/i7 for future upgrades, as well as a dedicated graphics card if you need it in the future.  It also has USB 3.0 and SATA 6.0 (2).

**RAM**  2 Sticks of DDR3-1333 for Dual channel support.  4GB total.  No upgrade options due to 2 slot limitation, but considering 4GB is still holding as more than adequate, I think its a safe bet instead of 1 4GB stick.

**SSD** Now we have an SSD main drive and a HD Secondary.  For most users you can partion this to allow a backup of the SSD and extra storage space....or just enjoy having room for movies, pictures and music.

**Case** NZXT Source 210 Elite.  Has USB 3.0 port on front and thumb screws for easy installation.  It is also roomy enough and well built enough to keep around for a few more builds down the road.  Also has 2 fans, so for most builds you wont need to purchase an additional fan for cooling.

**PSU**  A 500Watt 80 plus PSU that can support up to a 7850 and an i5 if you chose to upgrade.

Mostly this is just an all around slightly better computer. Some parts are the same, but it should run a bit faster and have a bit more future proofing.

Light gaming and web browsing. Most recently we're planning on playing Dota 2 and Dead Space 3 together, as well as Battlefield 3 online, and she would also like to play Skyrim (lightly modded).

&gt;What is your maximum preferred budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?

Our budget right now is around $700 but it's slightly flexible. We can always upgrade later.

&gt;When do you plan on building/buying the PC?

Within the next few days, I'd like to order the parts by Friday at the very latest.

&gt;What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? 

I have my old GTX 560 ti laying around and was planning on using that at the moment, as it still runs fine and is powerful enough for the games she wants to run. Otherwise we need pretty much everything. She has absolutely nothing, not even an OS, monitor, mouse and keyboard. A decent headset too would be nice, 'cause right now she only has those ipod headphones with the horrible mic that picks up everything in the house, making it impossible to hear her.

For the monitor I'd prefer at least a 23 inch 1080p though I know they might not fit in the budget, and the mouse and keyboard would preferably be something at least somewhat suitable for gaming and not just some cheap piece of plastic. The OS can be windows 7 or 8 it doesn't really matter, though windows 7 would probably be easier for her to use, as she's used to it.

She's also only 5 feet tall and not very strong, so nothing too big and heavy would be nice. Our current situation does not allow for me to go over to see her very much right now so something she can move around on her own would be nice.

&gt;Which country will you be purchasing the parts in?

We will be purchasing them in Canada. I don't think I've ever even seen a Microcenter here or if they're even in Canada so I'd like to keep that out of the build.

&gt;If reusing any parts, what parts will you be reusing?

I will be reusing my old EVGA gtx 560 ti.

&gt;Will you be overclocking?

I'd rather not. I've never done it myself before and she would definitely not be able to do it. I'd feel more comfortable not overclocking, especially since, as stated earlier, I'm not able to visit very much currently and wouldn't be able to fix or adjust anything.

&gt;Do you have any specific case/tower preferences such as a window or LEDs, or do you have a preference for low-noise components?

There is nothing I can think of that I haven't already mentioned.

&gt;Do you already have a legit and reusable/transferable OS key/license? If yes, what OS?

Nope. Preferably would like the build to include Windows 7 or 8, but 7 would probably be easier for her to use since she's used to it.",,False,self,t5_2tjcr,False,,,True,t3_1kemwh,http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcforme/comments/1kemwh/need_a_light_gaming_pc_for_my_girlfriend_her/,

I will be gaming (I want to be able to max settings on games such as Battlefield 4 etc), I will be doing a lot of internet browsing (many tabs open at once) and I also plan on using it as a multimedia unit (such as a blu-ray player) and a multimedia storage (a lot of films etc).

I have all the peripherals such as mouse, keyboard, monitor etc. I want included in the budget the computer case and it's internal components - ie the computer itself.

**&gt;Which country will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in the US, are you near a Microcenter store?**

Sweden, I will probably buy alot from www.inet.se

**&gt;If reusing any parts, what parts will you be reusing? Please be especially specific about the power supply. List make and model. If you have a monitor, list the size/resolution.**

I will only be reusing the outer peripherals, such as mouse, keyboard, monitor etc. My monitor is a BenQ 22'' 1920 x 1080p

**&gt;Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?**

I have never done it before, but thats because I know to little about it. I might be interested in doing it in a distant future.

**&gt;If there's any specific features you want/need from the rig, please list them. Examples might include rear and/or front-panel USB 3.0, a RAID setup, etc.**

Some special things I want is a **blu-ray reader**, **watercooling system** for all the necessary components to make the computer as quiet as possible, a **soundcard with 7.1 capability** and a **motherboard with wi-fi and dual-monitor capabilities .**  

**&gt;Do you have any specific case/tower preferences such as a window or LEDs, or do you have a preference for low-noise components?**

I do have a preference for low-noise components - I want to make the computer as quiet as possible - and therefore I would prefer to have a nice looking sound-proof case without unnessecary LEDs or windows. I must also be able to put a watercooling system in the case.


**&gt;Do you already have a legit and reusable/transferable OS key/license? If yes, what OS?**

Yes, Windows 8

&gt;Do you have any specific case/tower preferences such as a window or LEDs, or do you have a preference for low-noise components?

No real preferences for features of case (although the quieter the better I guess), but, with it cheaper than you can usually find it, and with good reviews, I was looking at this one: http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0091C7S4Y/ref=olp_product_details?ie=UTF8&amp;me=&amp;seller=

No, I am ultimately willing to shell out for one, but am also interested in what you guys have to say about the pros/cons of pirating an OS, and how you get it onto the computer which doesn't at first have an operating system while you're trying to do this.

&gt;Extra info or specifics:

As the title hints, I am more interested in the cost than the performance, provided it can atleast play skyrim etc. even if on low settings. This is because I will mostly just use it for League of Legends anyway (not too demanding). However, considering I have a fairly good graphics card already, and I would also like this to last as long as possible, I am open to the idea of shedding out a bit more than I HAVE to considering what I want to use it for, so that I don't bottleneck the graphics card and so that I get decent parts which may last a bit longer.

My PC would be used for general use such as web browsing as well as for school work. However, I would also like to run games at really good settings such as Borderlands 2 and Skyrim.

&gt;What is your maximum preferred budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?

I would like to stay within the price range of $550-$600, but at the very maximum I could potentially go for $650-$700 if there would be significant differences.

&gt;When do you plan on building/buying the PC? (note: if you're planning on buying more than 2 weeks from now, it's very much recommended you wait and come back then, to ensure you get the most recent and accurate price data)

Hopefully in the next few weeks, if not I will probably repost this at a later date to get accurate prices.

&gt;What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? ""Everything"" is not specific enough. Tower, Operating System, peripherals like the keyboard, mouse, and monitor(s), wifi adapter, speakers/headphones, etc. are all relevant.

Case, Motherboard, CPU, Video Card, RAM, Storage, WiFi Adapter, PSU, and Optical Drive.

&gt;Which country will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in the US, are you near a Microcenter store?

U.S., I have a Microcenter store about a half hour away.

&gt;If reusing any parts, what parts will you be reusing? Please be especially specific about the power supply. List make and model. If you have a monitor, list the size/resolution.

I already have a 24"" 1920x1080 monitor and USB keyboard and mouse.

&gt;Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?

I have no plans of overclocking.

&gt;If there's any specific features you want/need from the rig, please list them. Examples might include rear and/or front-panel USB 3.0, a RAID setup, etc.

No specific features.

&gt;Do you have any specific case/tower preferences such as a window or LEDs, or do you have a preference for low-noise components?

Any kind of case will do, yet having a window would be nice. No other preferences though.

Yes, Windows 7 Home Premium

Thanks in advance :),15,5,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcforme/comments/1iwr99/computer_for_a_reasonably_high_end_university/,"&gt;What will you be doing with this PC? Gaming? Photoshop? Web browsing? etc. If you need a Workstation, be specific on the programs you'll be using. Try to list as many games/applications that you'll be using as you can, as well as your performance goals for those programs.

This PC will be used purely as a radio playout system,sending audio from the pc to a mixing desk. Therefore the only real software will likely be the playout software Rivendell which runs on Linux. 

I also aim for another one or two PC's for the purpose of streaming the complete audio (that coming out of the output of the mixing desk) and also logging this audio (recording the audio for splitting into podcasts and for archiving purposes -metadata of tracks etc). In terms of requirements I believe these computers don't need to be very high end and can't really offer any specific requirements. 

&gt;What is your maximum preferred budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?

I have a total of £2500 (about $3800) so for everything so I guess before shipping it would be about £2400 ish right?

&gt;When do you plan on building/buying the PC?

 Within the next two weeks.

&gt;What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? ""Everything"" is not specific enough. Tower, Operating System, peripherals like the keyboard, mouse, and monitor(s), wifi adapter, speakers/headphones, etc. are all relevant.

The money I've been allocated needs to cover everything computer related so a monitor will be needed (preferably a 19in ELO touch screen monitor) for ease of use (and compatibility with rivendell) for the students using the playout system although the touchscreen element  is not completely necessary. I would ideally need a motherboard that could support dual monitors (as a side note, would it work if one of the monitors was touch screen and the other was not?) and very upgradeable/future proof. Would be useful to have one screen for the playout system and the other for displaying the internet so shows could access their twitter/facebook when they're on the air. A powerful sound card will also be required for the playout system computer, I believe the M-Audio Delta 1010 to be amicable in this case although I am clearly inexperienced so any pointers would be really appreciated. 

Tower needs to be included, main HD doesn't need to be particularly big as will only largely be used for the purpose of the playout software. Additional HD required for storing show audio, this needs to be between 4-5TB I imagine. Needs to be future proof and upgradeable so I'd need some suitable RAM, I'm thinking 6-8GB? Reasonable processor too, i5 or i7? 
Graphics don't need to be very good I don't think for this set-up.


&gt;Which country will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in the US, are you near a Microcenter store?

The UK

&gt;If reusing any parts, what parts will you be reusing? Please be especially specific about the power supply. List make and model. If you have a monitor, list the size/resolution.

No parts reused.

&gt;Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?

I'm unsure of this, potentially, although I can't see it being that necessary?

&gt;If there's any specific features you want/need from the rig, please list them. Examples might include rear and/or front-panel USB 3.0, a RAID setup, etc.

The rig needs to be fairly futureproof for its purpose, i.e last at least 3 years without problems. It ideally needs to be as stable as possible as obviously if the system goes, the radio goes down with it. If anyone could advise me on a suitable backup system for the playout computer I would most appreciate it. 

&gt;Do you have any specific case/tower preferences such as a window or LEDs, or do you have a preference for low-noise components?

Low noise preferably.

&gt;Do you already have a legit and reusable/transferable OS key/license? If yes, what OS? 

Would be running on Linux.

Gaming? Photoshop? Web browsing? etc. If you need a Workstation, be specific on the programs you'll be using. Try to list as many games/applications that you'll be using as you can, as well as your performance goals for those programs.

I plan to use this PC as a workstation for university, for web browsing, and gaming.  I primarily play slightly older games like TES: Oblivion and Portal although I also would like to play new games like Starcraft 2 and Civilization V.  I guess I just don't want to be severely limited on gaming performance as I am now on my laptop.  I don't think I’ll use too much additional software other than Microsoft Office and some sort of media player like VLC for music and the occasional movie.

I would like to play these newer games on med-high settings although I realize this may be difficult on a small budget (considering that I’m building this PC from scratch).

&gt;What is your maximum preferred budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?

My absolute maximum is $800, however I would be more comfortable around $700.  I’m only willing to pay the extra $100 if it gets me something significantly worth it.

&gt;When do you plan on building/buying the PC? (note: if you're planning on buying more than 2 weeks from now, it's very much recommended you wait and come back then, to ensure you get the most recent and accurate price data)

I will be building this computer as soon as I reach a consensus on what parts I should buy.  Hopefully in one week from now.

&gt;What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? ""Everything"" is not specific enough. Tower, Operating System, peripherals like the keyboard, mouse, and monitor(s), wifi adapter, speakers/headphones, etc. are all relevant.

For peripherals, I need a keyboard, and a monitor (preferably with built-in speakers).  I need the tower and all necessary components inside.  I need a power supply and WiFi adaptor as well.  All I have is a mouse and some really cheap speakers.

&gt;Which country will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in the US, are you near a Microcenter store?

Canada (Alberta)

&gt;If reusing any parts, what parts will you be reusing? Please be especially specific about the power supply. List make and model. If you have a monitor, list the size/resolution.

The only thing I don’t need is a mouse.  I have an old 160GB HDD that I could use for storage if that's of any use but other than that I am not reusing any other parts.

&gt;Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?

I don’t think I will ever be overclocking.

&gt;If there's any specific features you want/need from the rig, please list them. Examples might include rear and/or front-panel USB 3.0, a RAID setup, etc.

I would like a couple of front panel USB ports for ease of access under my desk.

&gt;Do you have any specific case/tower preferences such as a window or LEDs, or do you have a preference for low-noise components?

No preferences here.  If anything, I generally like simplicity in design but that's a very low priority.

&gt;Do you already have a legit and reusable/transferable OS key/license? If yes, what OS?

No, I need an OS as well.  I’ll leave it to your discretion whether Windows 7 or 8 is more appropriate for me.  I enjoy playing very old games like Civilization II though so the more compatible, the better.

I plan on using it for regular gaming, emulators (PS2/Gamecube especially), watching blu-rays, and basic everyday stuff like email, reddit, etc. 

&gt;What is your maximum preferred budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?

~$1000, but under a $1000 would be awesome.  I'm basically looking for something that would be able to run most new games at pretty high settings and not be completely outclassed in a year or two, if that's possible to get for a lot less than $1000 let me know!

&gt;What, exactly, do you need included in the budget?

This is my first gaming pc so I'll need a tower, HDD (solid state is preferred), OS, CPU, GPU, motherboard, ram, monitor, PSU, Wifi adapter, blu ray drive

 &gt;Which country will you be purchasing the parts in? 

US, I am not near a Microcenter store

&gt;If reusing any parts, what parts will you be reusing?
Keyboard, speakers, mouse (would maybe be interested in picking up a more gaming oriented mouse, but haven't decided)

&gt;Will you be overclocking?

Unsure about overclocking.  Would be willing to overclock CPU/GPU if performance was significantly improved

&gt;Do you have any specific case/tower preferences such as a window or LEDs, or do you have a preference for low-noise components?

Nope, low-noise would be nice, but it's not a deal breaker

Basically, I bought a custom computer a few years back. The Mobo went bad and the company went out of business. So I took parts out of it as I needed them. Now my interim ""just for now"" Compaq is going under and I want to use the case from my custom built to start on a new build.

Here are the parts I already have: 

Case: **Thermaltake matrix VD2000BNS Black/ Silver SECC Japanese steel ATX Mid Tower Computer Case:** http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811133007

2 DVD Drives still attached to the mobo.

Monitor: **ViewSonic Optiquest Series Q19wb Black 19"" 5ms Widescreen LCD Monitor** http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16824116014 (I don't want to change this monitor, I like it. I run at 1440x900.)

Keyboard, mouse and speakers that I'm quite happy with.

***

I would like:

* A SSD for the OS.
* A 1TB Drive for back-up
* 8 gb of ram, unless more is needed to record, play and render at the same time.
* CPU, Power supply and GPU no particular preference, just as long as they are powerful enough to do what I need.
* An OS (would prefer windows 7)

Price range? **$500 - $800** 

Thanks in advance!!

Edited to clarify: I do not have a microcenter near me so I prefer Amazon/Newegg and I do not plan to mess with OC'ing.

Hopefully I can get a clear answer (preferably via PCPartPicker).

&gt;What will you be doing with this PC? 
Gaming, period.  I have a MacBook for everything else.  I'm looking to run things like Starcraft, Diablo, Skyrim, Call of Duty, Borderlands, and upcoming games like Assassins creed 4, Thief, Watchdogs, &amp; TitanFall.

&gt;What is your maximum preferred budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?
I'm looking to max out at $500.  Since I'm buying piece by piece, I could go as high as $700 and just not buy it all at once, but the cheaper the better.

&gt;When do you plan on building/buying the PC? 
As said before, the cheaper it is, the sooner I'll buy.  Basically, $400 and less would be at once, almost instantly; $400-500 would be in pieces, over a couple to a few weeks; $500+ will be over a couple paychecks.
 
&gt;What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? 
I do not need a monitor, speakers, mouse, or keyboard since I have three of the four and plan on using my TV for the monitor.  After that, I need everything, haha!  I only say everything because I don't know what goes on the inside.  Any tower works (smaller would be preferred) Wifi is essential unless it costs too much, then I could make due with ethernet, obviously some USB's, OS too (the super cheap Windows 8 works), and I trust professional judgement on the need of a CD drive since almost everything is digital these days and I do have a laptop for other uses. Then again, how is Windows installed with no CD drive? Not sure if I'm forgetting anything.

&gt;Which country will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in the US, are you near a Microcenter store?
I will be purchasing in the US and I am NOT near a microcenter store.

&gt;If reusing any parts, what parts will you be reusing? Please be especially specific about the power supply. List make and model. If you have a monitor, list the size/resolution.
I'm hoping to use my 44' Sharp Aquos TV with an HDMI input hopefully at 1080p.  If there are any serious complications with this, I would need a monitor and I'm not sure what I would buy.

&gt;Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?
No, I only have even the vaguest clue about what over clocking is anyway.

&gt;If there's any specific features you want/need from the rig, please list them. Examples might include rear and/or front-panel USB 3.0, a RAID setup, etc.
I'd love to offer some insight, but I honestly have no clue.  A few USB's are needed because ideally I'd like to have a keyboard, mouse, and 360 controller plugged in at all times with a USB or two free for whatever.

&gt;Do you have any specific case/tower preferences such as a window or LEDs, or do you have a preference for low-noise components?
Zero preference, cost and performance are my only concerns.  I'm not sure if size of the case/tower determine future upgradability, but I'd like something somewhat compact.

&gt;Do you already have a legit and reusable/transferable OS key/license? If yes, what OS?
No, need Windows 8.

&gt;Extra info or specifics:
I'm not looking to run my games at max settings, but default or slightly above would be nice.

Mom primarily uses the PC for internet banking, Excel, word processing, and a lot of web browsing.

What will you be doing with this PC? Gaming? Photoshop? Web browsing? etc. If you need a Workstation, be specific on the programs you'll be using.

&gt;My gaming is mostly limited to Sid Meier's Civilization Series (I have the latest, which barely runs on my MacBook), Starcraft II, and DOTA. I do use Photoshop, and I heavily rely on web browsing. It's not uncommon for me to have several memory hog programs open.

2.) What is your maximum preferred budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?
&gt;I'd say maximum budget would be around $1400.

3.) When do you plan on building/buying the PC? (note: if you're planning on buying more than 2 weeks from now, it's very much recommended you wait and come back then, to ensure you get the most recent and accurate price data)
&gt;I'm ready to go.

4.) What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? ""Everything"" is not specific enough. Just the tower? Operating System? Keyboard, mouse, monitor, speakers/headset, WiFi adapter, etc?
&gt;Tower and OS needed. I'd also like a second 1080p 22 inch or above second monitor.

5.) Which country will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in the US, are you near a Microcenter store?
&gt;I'm in New Jersey, in the US. I don't believe there's a Microsoft store near me.

6.) If reusing any parts, what parts will you be reusing? Please be especially specific about the power supply. List make and model. If you have a monitor, list the size/resolution.
&gt;[Here](http://www.amazon.com/Samsung-S22A350H-22-Inch-Class-Monitor/dp/B004O6ADGW/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top) is a link to the monitor I'd like to use. Samsung 22 inch LED 1080p S22A350H.

7.) Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line?
&gt;I don't think this is necessary for my needs.

8.) If there's any specific features you want/need from the rig, please list them. Examples might include rear and/or front-panel USB 3.0, a RAID setup, etc.
&gt;-USB 3.0

&gt;-Dual Monitors

&gt;-High RAM

&gt;-High Memory on board (1-2 TB)

9.) Do you already have a legit and reusable/transferable OS key/license? If yes, what OS? Is it 32bit or 64bit?
&gt;Not legit, but I have several pirated licenses that should work okay.

10.) Extra info or specifics:

I am looking to build a multi-monitor Gaming / Film / Development PC with a flexible budget of around £1300 (could go to perhaps £1700 or above if really needed, but I'd rather not spend too much). The parts will be bought in the UK and I am willing to consider Overclocking (though not much, I want the PC to be as stable as possible and I have no previous experience). Having the ability to easily upgrade / switch out parts would also be a plus.


Some of the requirements for the build:

* I host a small to medium sized [24/7 Bukkit (Minecraft) server](http://silverserver.weebly.com/index.html).

* I would like to play games (sometimes on 3 screens) reasonably well (no need to record the screens). The more intensive games will be ARMA 2, GTAIV, and BF3. I'd like to be able to play GTAV, ARMA 3 and maybe BF4 when (or if) they're released also.
* I'll be watching (and storing) a lot of films.
* I'll be programming using Netbeans and perhaps other IDEs.
* Windows 7, perhaps I can get this through my University (1st year Computer Science student).
* Perhaps a dual boot with Linux (I've not tried dual booting before, but could come in useful for Uni work).
* 3TB storage (+ SDD perhaps?), with room for another drive down the line.
* I would prefer a case that's simple (I especially dislike the LEDs some have, is there any way to turn those off?).
* 2 USB ports would be nice but not essential.
* No need for any optical drives.

Not that all of these things will be running at once normally, but that's what I am going to be asking out of this computer.

My speakers are fine. The keyboard and mouse are OK but can be replaced if there's any money left. The only things I really need are the box, the screens, and Windows. This will be my first PC build so I am coming to you guys for suggestions before I move to /r/buildapc.

I'm also looking for recommendations on a desk and computer chair. These could be included or outside the budget.

Thank you! I'll be buying the parts once I've got everything sorted. Feel free to ask any questions you may have.

Hey guys, as you might have read by the title **I HAVE NO CLUE WHAT I'M DOING**. This is my **FIRST EVER PC BUILD**. Which I'm sure you guys get handed a lot but in this case I've no clue as to what goes where and what does what. **HOWEVER**, I've got someone IRL to help me with all of that so do not fret. I've got about $1200-$1500 to order parts from. I've heard that you guys know(more often than not) what you can put into a desktop whilst getting more bang for your buck.

* My friend (the one who is helping me build this thing) tells me to inform you of the games that I play so you guys can get an idea of what kind of duress my PC will be put under.

* The games I generally play are: League of Legends, World of Warcraft, Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, Minecraft, and a handful of Indie games here and there. Apparently it's also important to tell you **I HAVE MANY MODS FOR SKYRIM**, apparently that takes up a lot of memory? (No clue why) Anyways, those are the games.

TL;DR I'm an ignorant goose, $1200-$1500 to spend on this desktop, show me what you got and I'll hug you :)

Overall if you guys can put together odds and ends to make me a potent gaming PC for around $1200-$1500 I will spread your name around like peanut butter on toast so people now that guys for r/buildapcforme are the some of the best guys on the interwebs!

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: I also would prefer that this computer can make it to at least Medium High-High graphics for these games. Not sure if that goes without saying but I thought it's safe to inform you on that front.

**EDIT**:Thank you all for the incredibly fast responses! I will be sending over the selected build for critiquing over at r/buildapc. I truly appreciate what you guys have done for me and in such haste as well! 

**EDIT2**: Wow, I feel like a complete idiot for not following appropriate procedure and taking time away from you guys. I'm so very sorry karmapopsicle, I'm not an avid redditor as this is my friend's account.

I've built my last two PCs but was very conservative (spent less than $700) and so would like help getting best bang for the buck to play Flight Simulator X. As mentioned in the title. 


She's already bought 3 24.1"" displays @ 1920x1200 resolution so I would really like to get the most out of them with a powerful crossfire setup. The dispays do have a display port in addition to DVI and HDMI so doing 3 screen eyefinity shouldn't be a problem. Here's what I have so far, about $175 under the $2000 budget. All suggestions greatly appreciated!

I looked at using Gigabyte 7970s instead of the XFX 7950s and it puts me $100 over budget. Is the performance increase worth the extra $$ or perhaps changing another component to cover it? I was thinking the memory might be overkill and I could get him a cheaper keyboard.

Gaming? Photoshop? Web browsing? etc. If you need a Workstation, be specific on the programs you'll be using. Try to list as many games/applications that you'll be using as you can, as well as your performance goals for those programs.

Mainly gaming. I want to be able to play Skyrim (with mods), SC2, KPS, Eve Online, and whatever else I throw money at on Steam with the best possible performance. 

&gt;What is your maximum preferred budget before rebates/shipping/taxes? I'd prefer it to be around $1000, but I can do $1100 if needed.

&gt;When do you plan on building/buying the PC? (note: if you're planning on buying more than 2 weeks from now, it's very much recommended you wait and come back then, to ensure you get the most recent and accurate price data)

Within the next week, hopefully Monday, but no later than Wednesday.

&gt;What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? ""Everything"" is not specific enough. Tower, Operating System, peripherals like the keyboard, mouse, and monitor(s), wifi adapter, speakers/headphones, etc. are all relevant.

Tower with everything inside, a wifi adapter, and maybe a monitor. I have a TV I could use, but I would like to upgrade to a nicer monitor. I already have a gaming mouse and keyboard.

&gt;Which country will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in the US, are you near a Microcenter store?

In US, not near a Microcenter :(

&gt;If reusing any parts, what parts will you be reusing? Please be especially specific about the power supply. List make and model. If you have a monitor, list the size/resolution.

Maybe my TV as explained above though I'd like to upgrade. It's a 19"" LCD, 720p, 1366 x 768 resolution.

&gt;Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?

I'm not interested in it with this PC.

&gt;If there's any specific features you want/need from the rig, please list them. Examples might include rear and/or front-panel USB 3.0, a RAID setup, etc.

Just a decent amount of USB ports, my keyboard, mouse, and gaming headset are all USB powered and I often use these while using USB drives to transport files.

&gt;Do you have any specific case/tower preferences such as a window or LEDs, or do you have a preference for low-noise components?

A window would be nice, but isn't necessary.

&gt;Do you already have a legit and reusable/transferable OS key/license? If yes, what OS?

I will need Windows 7.

&gt;Extra info or specifics: I really like Intel and Nvidia parts. I've also had my eye on the GTX 760 for awhile, but I will listen to reason, so if you can pose a reasonable argument for a build without these I will definitely take it into consideration.

In about 2 weeks I would like to order.

Wifi adapter, Monitor.


&gt;Which country will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in the US, are you near a Microcenter store?

All websites will have to be Australian, try and stay at Mwave, because that's my most preferred website.


&gt;If reusing any parts, what parts will you be reusing? Please be especially specific about the power supply. List make and model. If you have a monitor, list the size/resolution.

Ok so I have at home an DVD reader, I will most likely need a monitor because the one I have now is just not gonna cut it for the gameplay I want to do, so ill go up to AUD $1150 if that will get me a decent monitor.


&gt;Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?

Maybe in the future I would like that extra performance


&gt;If there's any specific features you want/need from the rig, please list them. Examples might include rear and/or front-panel USB 3.0, a RAID setup, etc.

USB 3.0

Gaming (Playing new games on ~100 fps, would like to be able to run games like League of Legends at 120~200 fps on low/medium/high settings, either is fine). I would also be using this for school work and web browsing.

&gt;What is your maximum preferred budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?

I would like to pay around $1500 for it, but up as far as $2000 if my requirements can't be met for 1.5k.

&gt;When do you plan on building/buying the PC? (note: if you're planning on buying more than 2 weeks from now, it's very much recommended you wait and come back then, to ensure you get the most recent and accurate price data)

I plan on buying the PC as soon as I figure out which parts I should buy, and I will be setting it up as soon as I get the parts. School starts in 2-3 weeks for me and i would like to get it set up before then.

&gt;What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? ""Everything"" is not specific enough. Tower, Operating System, peripherals like the keyboard, mouse, and monitor(s), wifi adapter, speakers/headphones, etc. are all relevant.

I need an operating system and a case, all external elements such as headphones, a mouse, a keyboard, and a monitor are already in my possession. As long as I get the computer up and running I will have everything that I need.

&gt;Which country will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in the US, are you near a Microcenter store?

I will be purchasing them in the United States, and I'm around an hour away from a Microcenter store.

&gt;If reusing any parts, what parts will you be reusing? Please be especially specific about the power supply. List make and model. If you have a monitor, list the size/resolution.

I don't have any computer parts right now. I do have a 23' monitor with 1920x1080 resolution. I will be buying every computer part new.

&gt;Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?

I don't plan on overclocking any of my computer parts. I suppose it would be nice to have the option open to me so if I wanted to at some point down the line I could, but it's not necessary.

&gt;If there's any specific features you want/need from the rig, please list them. Examples might include rear and/or front-panel USB 3.0, a RAID setup, etc.

It would be great if I could have a headphone jack and a usb port or two in the front, but I would also like some usb ports and an hdmi port in the back for the my keyboard/monitor plugins that I wouldn't like to be visible.

&gt;Do you have any specific case/tower preferences such as a window or LEDs, or do you have a preference for low-noise components?

I would really like for the computer to have a great cooling system that doesn't make a lot of noise. It would also be really nice to have some LEDs if the price allows it. Again, they're not necessary.

&gt;Do you already have a legit and reusable/transferable OS key/license? If yes, what OS?

No, I don't currently have an OS key. I would need to buy a new OS.

Keep in mind that this would be used for school and gaming. It needs to be equally capable of performing in each situation. It would be nice for the case to look sleek and take up as little space as possible. I would also like to be able to stream video games on it if possible.

&gt;What, exactly, do you need included in the budget?
I already a keyboard, mouse and speakers. All I need is the actual tower and the parts inside it of course.

&gt;Which country will you be purchasing the parts in?
U.S. and unfortunately I don't live near a Microcenter.

&gt;If reusing any parts, what parts will you be reusing?
Nope.

&gt;Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line?
If the CPU is simple to overclock, then yes, I will.


&gt;If there's any specific features you want/need from the rig, please list them. 

Nope. Not anything in particular.

&gt;Do you have any specific case/tower preferences such as a window or LEDs, or do you have a preference for low-noise components?
No.

&gt;Do you already have a legit and reusable/transferable OS key/license? If yes, what OS?
Yes, Windows 7 Home.",,False,self,t5_2tjcr,False,,,True,t3_1ifmjy,http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcforme/comments/1ifmjy/500600_gaming_pc_budget/,

What is your maximum preferred budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?
&gt;Well, I couldn't go much over $2,300. If there is a huge difference in performance for a hundred bucks, or so, I'd do it without thinking.

When do you plan on building/buying the PC? (note: if you're planning on buying more than 2 weeks from now, it's very much recommended you wait and come back then, to ensure you get the most recent and accurate price data)

&gt;Okay, so I will need a tower, everything to make her run, fans (if needed), keyboard, mouse and a decent OS.

Which country will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in the US, are you near a Microcenter store?
&gt;I live a while away from the closest Microcenter. If it saves me hundred of dollars, more than gas costs, I'll go for it.

If reusing any parts, what parts will you be reusing? Please be especially specific about the power supply. List make and model. If you have a monitor, list the size/resolution.
&gt;Nope, nothing to re-use.

Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line?
&gt;Yup! It wouldn't be the same day of assembly, but I really do plan on overclocking. Again, performance of this build is key or me.

If there's any specific features you want/need from the rig, please list them. Examples might include rear and/or front-panel USB 3.0, a RAID setup, etc.
&gt;I'd like a cheap optical drive. That and really anything you can put into the budget.

Do you already have a legit and reusable/transferable OS key/license? If yes, what OS? Is it 32bit or 64bit?
&gt;Nope.

All the main components in the Tower minus HDD (I have a spare one), would like to have a 120GB SSD to boot from and put main applications. Need OS (Windows 64 bit). No keyboard/mouse required. Two monitors needed (one is suffice for now if it means better performance in another component.) Also need a wireless adapter.

First time builder (but will be heavily assisted in actual assembly), rising-collegiate PC gamer. Tired of getting reamed when buying pre-built rigs. Looking for something to last me through college. Lets do it!

*IMPORTANT* I am a minimalist, especially when it comes to space. I want this rig on the smaller side, even if it means paying extra. SMALL BUT MIGHTY IS MY AIM FOR THIS RIG.

This PC will be primarily for gaming, redditing, HEAVY music listening, and casual web-browsing. I wish for this build to be able to run most current titles and titles in this next two to four years at high to max graphics. Games I play include League of Legends, Wildstar, CoD, Bioshock Infinite, Age of Empires. Programs that will be ran will include Microsoft Office, Skype, Dolby Axon, Steam, and Ventrilo.

$2000-$2800

&gt;When do you plan on building/buying the PC? (note: if you're planning on buying more than 2 weeks from now, it's very much recommended you wait and come back then, to ensure you get the most recent and accurate price data)

ASAP on both purchase and assembly

&gt;What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? ""Everything"" is not specific enough. Tower, Operating System, peripherals like the keyboard, mouse, and monitor(s), wifi adapter, speakers/headphones, etc. are all relevant.

HD Monitor (This is the one part of the build that does not need to be small. Aiming for 20-24 inch screen), Case, hard drive, RAM, graphics card (HDMI), fans, power supply, CPU, heat sink, internal wifi adapter, motherboard, SSD, disk drive...all essential parts to a PC. I draw a blank on other parts, but essentially all key parts of a tower. Additionally, I need Windows 7 as the OS, no clue on which one to purchase. You tell me.

&gt;Which country will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in the US, are you near a Microcenter store?

I am in the US, but I don't live near any Microcenters. Most likely ordering all parts online.

&gt;If reusing any parts, what parts will you be reusing? Please be especially specific about the power supply. List make and model. If you have a monitor, list the size/resolution.

The only parts I plan to continue to use are are 1. Logitech G930 Wireless headset 2. Razer Naga mouse 3. Cooler Master Storm QuickFire Rapid Keyboard CherryMX Blue

&gt;Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?

I haven't any clue the benefits of overclocking, nor do I know how to overclock. So unless you see it as something that would greatly improve performance of the machine, I will not.

&gt;If there's any specific features you want/need from the rig, please list them. Examples might include rear and/or front-panel USB 3.0, a RAID setup, etc.

No preference on location of it, as it will mostly be used for wireless devices, but I do favor USB 3.0. I don't know if this is the right area, but I want the power supply on the bottom. I don't know the official terminology.

&gt;Do you have any specific case/tower preferences such as a window or LEDs, or do you have a preference for low-noise components?

This isn't a must, but if somehow achievable with the rest of the specs, Reddit Gold will be rewarded: Black case (believe the term would be ""hardware"", with a window to the inside, with purple lighting and fans, with the lights being controllable (e.i. different pulsing patterns, or something of the like.)

As far as noise, I want it to be very quiet. Not dead silent, I can handle a slight hum. But definitely not something you notice when walking into a room.

&gt;Do you already have a legit and reusable/transferable OS key/license? If yes, what OS?

No I do not. But I aim to buy Windows 7, don't know which one though. You'll have to tell me.

Mostly high-end gaming. If possible to run on highest settings at this budget that would be great. I will be playing games such as Skyrim, BF4 once it's out, Bioshock Infinite, mostly  next-gen. I mainly plan on using this for The Elder Scrolls Online once it is released. Also want to be ready for Steam Summer Sale so gaming, gaming, gaming. GAMING, OK?!

What is your maximum preferred budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?

800 before. At most. See --&gt; maximum.

What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? ""Everything"" is not specific enough. Tower, Operating System, peripherals like the keyboard, mouse, and monitor(s), wifi adapter, speakers/headphones, etc. are all relevant.

What I have: Monitor, Mouse, Keyboard, Speakers, Headphones

What I need: Tower, CPU, Mobo, Wifi Adapter, Video Card, all other components you deem necessary as I am quite the novice in building my own computer...and by quite the novice I mean I have no idea what I'm doing.

Which country will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in the US, are you near a Microcenter store?

Purchasing in the US. I am a few hours from a Microcenter store but would rather be able to pick up parts from a local electronic store such as best buy or something similar

If reusing any parts, what parts will you be reusing? Please be especially specific about the power supply. List make and model. If you have a monitor, list the size/resolution.

Have a monitor already at 1920x1080 so that's good. otherwise not reusing anything. 

Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?

Honestly, have been trying to figure out what this is, which most likely means I will NOT be doing it until I know what I'm doing :)

If there's any specific features you want/need from the rig, please list them. Examples might include rear and/or front-panel USB 3.0, a RAID setup, etc.

Need USB port (3.0 preferably), HDMI port, firewire if possible (but not necessary), headphone jack for sure.

Do you have any specific case/tower preferences such as a window or LEDs, or do you have a preference for low-noise components?

No. Low-noise would be preferable but is not necessary. As long as I'm not waking up neighbors...that'd be great.

Do you already have a legit and reusable/transferable OS key/license? If yes, what OS?

Yes, Windows 8 from student center at my college.

I want to get into PC Gaming. Also the usual (word processing/web browsing).

&gt;What is your maximum preferred budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?

$1000 but I plan on buying all components from a local microcenter.

&gt;When do you plan on building/buying the PC?

ASAP -- today even if there are certain deals that require it!

&gt;What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? 

Tower and OS. I have the rest right now and will upgrade those later!

&gt;Which country will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in the US, are you near a Microcenter store?

Boston's Microcenter

&gt;If reusing any parts, what parts will you be reusing? 

I have a Asus 24"" monitor. Pretty standard keyboard/mouse/speakers.

&gt;Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?

I'm interested in overclocking if it will significantly raise the value of the computer for a couple of years?

&gt;If there's any specific features you want/need from the rig, please list them. Examples might include rear and/or front-panel USB 3.0, a RAID setup, etc.

SSD if possible. Also, I don't really enjoy Windows 8 on my laptop but if I'm missing something I'm open to Windows 8.

&gt;Do you have any specific case/tower preferences such as a window or LEDs, or do you have a preference for low-noise components?

Hmm..no preference really, this is my first build.

&gt;Do you already have a legit and reusable/transferable OS key/license? If yes, what OS?

None!

I will be using this purely as a gaming computer, and i will mostly be playing skyrim and battlefield 4 when it comes out.
   

 &gt;What is your maximum preferred budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?

$1900 New Zealand dollars.



    &gt;When do you plan on building/buying the PC? (note: if you're planning on buying more than 2 weeks from now, it's very much recommended you wait and come back then, to ensure you get the most recent and accurate price data)

I will be building the computer on June the 23rd

&gt;What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? ""Everything"" is not specific enough. Tower, Operating System, peripherals like the keyboard, mouse, and monitor(s), wifi adapter, speakers/headphones, etc. are all relevant.

This budget covers just the tower as i have already got a screen and mouse, and ill buy a keyboard when im at the store depending on what they have.
    
&gt;Which country will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in the US, are you near a Microcenter store?

All parts will be bought in New Zealand.
   

 &gt;If reusing any parts, what parts will you be reusing? Please be especially specific about the power supply. List make and model. If you have a monitor, list the size/resolution.
    
No parts will be re used, i will be buying everything new.

&gt;Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?
    
Yes, down the track I will most certainly be overclocking. But if needed you can leave out the aftermarket cooler to increase the amount of money available for other parts. 

&gt;If there's any specific features you want/need from the rig, please list them. Examples might include rear and/or front-panel USB 3.0, a RAID setup, etc.

I was wondering about getting the next gen of intel CPU's, but was wondering if they actually offered any improvement over the old ones. And ive been looking at radeon 7970's but once again, i dont know enough about computers to know which card would be best.
   

 &gt;Do you have any specific case/tower preferences such as a window or LEDs, or do you have a preference for low-noise components?
   
No i dont mind if its slightly noisy, ill be wearing headphones 90% of the time, so noise wont be a nuisance. A windowed case would be nice too, and having LED fans would make it look great too. 
&gt;Do you already have a legit and reusable/transferable OS key/license? If yes, what OS? 

No i dont, but there is no need to include an OS in the budget. I'm going to try bargain for a free OS at my local store, they have done it multiple times for other people i know.

I'll mostly be using it for gaming and programming. Games such as Skyrim with a few mods should run at high.

Around $900 is my maximum.

* When do you plan on building/buying the PC? (note: if you're planning on buying more than 2 weeks from now, it's very much recommended you wait and come back then, to ensure you get the most recent and accurate price data)

Buying within the next week and a half.

* What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? ""Everything"" is not specific enough. Tower, Operating System, peripherals like the keyboard, mouse, and monitor(s), wifi adapter, speakers/headphones, etc. are all relevant.

I have a keyboard and mouse. Will have to buy everything else, including a 21 inch + monitor and decent speakers.

* Which country will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in the US, are you near a Microcenter store?

I live in the US, and am not near a Microcenter store.

Not reusing any parts.

I will not be overclocking.

* If there's any specific features you want/need from the rig, please list them. Examples might include rear and/or front-panel USB 3.0, a RAID setup, etc.

Front panel USB3 ports would be super useful. A small SSD is good, and I won't need an optical drive.

* Do you have any specific case/tower preferences such as a window or LEDs, or do you have a preference for low-noise components?

No preference.

* Do you already have a legit and reusable/transferable OS key/license? If yes, what OS?

My school provides free *upgrades* for Windows, so if I get the cheapest edition of Windows I should be able to upgrade it for free.

* Extra info or specifics:

Just to reiterate, this is a complete build, including monitors, speakers, etc. I don't need a keyboard or mouse. A small (perhaps 64GB) SSD would be super useful to speed up boot times and such. No optical drives.

I have knowledge of everything, so no need to explain it to me like I'm five, but I would be happy if you guys could help me out a little bit. 

**How much is too much?**
&gt;See, I want the absolute *best* performance possible on a single screen (1080p most likely.) Now I know the 780 just dropped, and Haswell is up and coming, and I would like to include those in my build. What I'm pretty much asking is where do I stop? My budget started at $800.00 and quickly elevated to $3,000.00. That's sort of overkill, and I know that. I'm sort of relying on some price opinions. Is the extra two grand worth it for one screen? Whatever the price ends up being, I'd gladly pay it. I'll also post results, I guess.

Given that little bit of information, here are the FAQ's:

&gt;What will you be doing with this PC? Gaming? Photoshop? Web browsing? etc. If you need a Workstation, be specific on the programs you'll be using.

I'm only here for the games, currently. I could see a streaming career in my future, but who knows?

&gt;What is your maximum preferred budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?

Well, I couldn't go much over $3,000. If there is a huge difference in performance for a few hundred bucks, I'd do it.

&gt;When do you plan on building/buying the PC? (note: if you're planning on buying more than 2 weeks from now, it's very much recommended you wait and come back then, to ensure you get the most recent and accurate price data)

Well, I may as well buy really soon. Like, within the week. However, I'd like to hear your educated opinions on Haswell. 

&gt;What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? ""Everything"" is not specific enough. Just the tower? Operating System? Keyboard, mouse, monitor, speakers/headset, WiFi adapter, etc?

Okay, so I will need a tower, everything to make her run, fans (if needed), keyboard, mouse and a decent OS.

&gt;Which country will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in the US, are you near a Microcenter store?

I live about 350 miles from the closest Microcenter. If it saves me hundred of dollars, more than gas costs, I'll go for it.

&gt;If reusing any parts, what parts will you be reusing? Please be especially specific about the power supply. List make and model. If you have a monitor, list the size/resolution.

Nope, nothing to re-use.

&gt;Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line?

Yup! It wouldn't be the same day of assembly, but I really do plan on overclocking. Again, performance of this build is key or me.

&gt;If there's any specific features you want/need from the rig, please list them. Examples might include rear and/or front-panel USB 3.0, a RAID setup, etc.

I'd like a cheap optical drive. That and really anything you an put into the budget.

&gt;Do you already have a legit and reusable/transferable OS key/license? If yes, what OS? Is it 32bit or 64bit?

Nope.

How does this build look the only part I need to add is a PSU which I need help choosing and maybe a CPU cooler?

I'm looking to play League of Legends most of the time. Also will it be able to run BF3 smoothly I don't mind playing on low video settings.

the parts you see in the custom(other) section I have already bought, at the prices indicated. The rest is what I need (no OS), except I still need a keyboard and mouse.

I want to be able to game and pretty good levels, and definitely want two monitors. I am not set on that motherboard either, but I do have the 3570k so I'd want to ability to OC if I want, as well as at least a few SATA3 ports.

I would say I have a pretty good understanding of how everything works/how to go about actually building a PC, but comparing all the different products to figure out what would work best for me seems like such a daunting task.  I've looked at some of the cookie cutter builds but would appreciate someone's opinion on what I actually need to buy.

____

**Purpose:** Looking to build a gaming PC that can run Diablo 3, Minecraft, Skyrim, Portal, maybe Battlefield 3, and Assassin's Creed on.  I'm not too worried about running these games on max settings, but decent graphics settings would be a plus.  I'm still new this building my own PC so I would like to start our fairly simple and upgrade as I learn more/have the money to buy new parts.



**Country:** I live in the US.  There is a Microcenter less than 30 minutes away and I'm more than willing to drive there.  There is an Amazon warehouse close to me also that I can get parts at.  Online retailers like NewEgg are fine, but picking up the parts at either Microcenter or the Amazon Warehouse is preferred.

**Budget:** I'm looking to spend about $350-$450.  Anywhere in this price range is acceptable.  The closer the build is to $450 (even a little over is fine) just adds a little wait time until I can save up the money, but that's not a huge deal to me.  I would prefer to save up a little bit longer if that can get more significantly better parts.

**What I Need:**

* Keyboard

* Case - plan to spend no more than $55 on one

* PSU

* Motherboard

* Processor

* Graphics Card

* RAM

* HDD - I already have a 250 gig hard drive and a 1 terabyte external I can use, but if the build supports a new hard drive that's fine.  I don't think I'll need more than 500 gigs for now.


**What I Don't Need:**

* Monitor

* Mouse

* OS - I'm going to get this through university

* Speakers

**Stock or Overclocking:** Right now a stock build is fine.  Being able to overclock in the future without much hassle would be best, but not crucial.

I am willing to spend between 2.5-4 grand would like that price to include shipping and taxes as well. I was originaly looking into alienware auroras, then I realised I could probably build something equal to if not better than for the same amount of cash.

I would like to go with a mid range 6core i7 processor, 16-32 gb ram, graphics cards are still up in the air and finally liquid cooling. Of course i will need a sexy ass tower to put everything into, I really liked the aurora towers but I really dont want to have to feed dell.

So if you guys could perhaps help me come up with a build scheme for my Ultimate gaming rig, it would be much appreciated. Oh and a little back ground on my current rig, it is a rebuild E-machine that i have had for quite some time and I have put off getting a good computer for so many years, it is time.

Here are the wonderful details that the sidebar tells me I need to post:

This will primarily be used for gaming. I would like to play most of the top games that are out, at ultra or high settings. That is the easy part. This computer will probably sit in one location, but may move around the house for various reasons.

I will use this for work, probably greater than once a week. Work stuff includes coding/compiling, possible audio processing, but also running multiple system configurations, both boot and VMs. I prefer to stick to the VMs, as I can manage them all at the same time... The only reason I bring this up is because of the i5 -&gt; i7 proc and socket 1155 -&gt; 2011 discussions. I can see utilizing at least 16 GB of memory in VMs in a quick-like fashion, so possibly more ram?? Thoughts?

I prefer Intel procs and NVidia GPUs, but purely out of tradition. If there were reasons to switch, I would love to hear. 
I would like to try to OC the proc and play with that, just a note for cooling.
I could see myself going SLI in the future, again just a note, so tips/modding/advice for this are appreciated.

I do not need OS, monitor, keyboard or mouse. If you have a favorite, I will tag it for a future purchase though.

Like I said, I have been looking around for a bit, and haven't really seen what I was looking for. If I missed it, please post a link so I can find my way.
With this in mind, I would greatly appreciate any input for this build.

In addition, tips for cable management would be appreciated, as I have been watching there as well.

TLDR: I need a nice rig, 2k to spend.  Should run games at ultra, and be able to support multi-VMs for work.

I wanted to get some other opinions, though). However, now I actually **need** a new PC, as my current laptop is no longer functional. I figure that now is as good a time as any to make the commitment and build.

It will definitely be used for gaming. From what I've read, I believe I could get a PC that runs most modern games at very high settings with this budget. However, I also need all peripherals (monitor(s), keyboard, mouse, and OS), so I know that will skew my final cost quite a bit. Ideally I'd like a large monitor (my current laptop had a 17"" screen, so larger than that would be good), and a decent mouse and keyboard. From what I've seen, Windows 7 seems to still be the way to go.

It will also be used for some media. I used to use my laptop to watch movies/TV shows in HD using the HDMI port, so I would love to be able to continue to do that, as my desk is quite close to my TV. This would also allow me to use Big Picture on Steam, which is something I find interesting. It may also be used for some video editing and things of that nature down the line, but this isn't a necessity if it would cost a lot more.

One more thing, I already have an external 1 TB drive, so hard drive space is not something I direly need. I've seen a lot of builds with 3 TB hard drives, and I definitely don't need anything like that. 750GB-1 TB should suffice for me. From what I've seen, I probably would want a solid state drive as well. Hopefully someone can give me some more insight on that.

This is what im looking to do:




So im wondering if I could possibly build a gaming PC that can play games on High (like Dark Souls) for a budget of $400.

**What I already have:**

* Monitor

* Mouse and Keyboard

* HDD

* PSU

* DVD Drive

* Windows







Im not sure if the PSU I have would need to be replaced to suit the needs So here is some info.

+12V1@18A, +12V2@18A, +12V3@15A

All at 450W

The brand is Coolmax.







**What I need:**

* CPU:

* GPU:

* RAM:

* CASE:

* MOBO:

* PSU (if mine isnt good enough).

$400 would be my spending limit for the missing components. I might be able to go up just a few bucks.

* $300-$400 budget, but it can go slightly above that if the quality difference makes it worth it. For example, if the build is $450 but it'll last him for the next few years that is worth it to me. 

* The only game he plays is WoW. He doesn't play anything else, so it literally just needs to be able to handle the latest requirements for this series and the next couple of expansions (if that is possible?). Besides playing WoW he just browses the internet and watches videos. So nothing else extensive.

*  I already own a legitimate copy of Windows 7 so that does not need to be a factor. I also have a mouse and keyboard. 

* I need the cheapest monitor possible but do not factor that into the budget. That will be a separate budget that his other sister will pitch in for. 

* I live in the US. 

So, with my budget is this a possibility? And would something like this be able to last him through the remaining 3 years of college? 

Thank you very much for your help!

I'll probably install a free OS like Ubuntu or Fedora and overclock it to get the most out of performance while avoiding overheating as well.

I've decided that my XPS from 2006 is no longer sufficient for my gaming needs.  I can't run anything with high graphics, it takes 7 minutes to turn on, and it raises the temperature in my room by 4 degrees (very noticable in the summer).  My friend recommended Reddit, so I made a profile and here I am.  Holy crap, TLDR already.  Sorry.

I'd say my budget is 1,200 bucks.  I'm most comfortable with Windows.  I primarily use the computer for gaming, most notably Guild Wars 2, which was the trigger towards getting a new computer.  I also watch tv shows on hulu and the occasional movie, but nothing else intense.

I can salvage my wireless mouse, USB keyboard, headset, and portable hard drive from my current computer.  I also have no problem scavanging the monitor which is a 19 inch Ultrasharp 1905FP Digital Flat Panel.  If you want to put your hand on my shoulder, shake your head, and say ""Oh, bakaninja, you poor, stupid fool"" and suggest a superior/neccessary monitor upgrade, I'm open to that too.  

I'm not entirely sure what overlocking is, so I'll say that I don't plan on doing that.  I also rarely poke around the inside of the computer once it's done, so I don't anticipate the need for free ports or space for additional future tech.

Oh yes, and my friends begged me to get a solid-state hard drive, so throw that in there!

EDIT: I have a copy of Windows 7 waiting, so no need to buy an OS.

This will be for Gaming. Will also do everyday things like web browsing and watching videos online (Netflix YouTube etc). I run games through Steam (Borderlands 2, Skyrim, Sleeping Dogs). I plan to play future titles like BF4. I'd like to be able to play new games at above medium settings at 1080p.

A HDMI output would be nice. I plug my laptop to my TV a lot and stream anime or play steam games with my controller. I'd like a SSD, but just large enough to boot windows. I won't need anything else on it. I want to be able to add another video card in the future to keep up with the times. Because of this I'd like to have a powerful single GPU with the intent to SLI or Crossfire later.
I'd like to have a Haswell processor, seems like it'd give me processor upgrade options later.
 
&gt;Do you have any specific case/tower preferences such as a window or LEDs, or do you have a preference for low-noise components?

I really like the aesthetic design of the white Bitfenix cases. My problem is that I don't know who makes quality cases or what size I'd need. I assume you can't SLI in a mini ITX build so that case is out of the question unless I am wrong ( I am new to this). Also it doesn't have to be a BitFenix if there are better quality cases you recommend. I'm not a fan of windows and crazy LEDs (the Colossus being the exception ).

I have been running this program without any issues on an inspiron 1525 laptop with these specks:

CPU: intel 2 duo T5850 @ 2.16GHz
Ram:  2 Gb speed?
OS: Windows 7 Professional 32 bit

And therefore convinced their requirements are overkill but understand why they encourage them. Also whatever we build will be faster and stronger than the server but that needs to wait till next quarter where this laptop is on its last leg. 

Side note this is not my office I am the new chiropractor that is taking over and trying to balance upgrades while still making money to live and pay off student loans. 

•	&gt;What is your maximum preferred budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?

I know this is not ideal but I cannot go over $500 comfortably at this point to stay in the green for the business always a little wiggle room for business because I do not want to build a lemon. 

•	&gt;When do you plan on building/buying the PC? (note: if you're planning on buying more than 2 weeks from now, it's very much recommended you wait and come back then, to ensure you get the most recent and accurate price data)

I need to have this figured out by the end of this month. So I might have to get an update in two weeks but plan to deal search with whatever seems to be the best fit you guys build for the office. 

•	&gt;What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? ""Everything"" is not specific enough. Tower, Operating System, peripherals like the keyboard, mouse, and monitor(s), wifi adapter, speakers/headphones, etc. are all relevant.

I have access to a Monitor, mouse, keyboard, possible psu (was for another build) and video card but was leaning towards APU to bypass that dedicated GPU. I also have an old tower I can use I believe it is a dell workstation that is just an htpc at home that is not being used after the move. 

•	&gt;Which country will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in the US, are you near a Microcenter store?

United States and not near a microcenter but will be traveling for business in two weeks about an hour outside of Philly so a possible option but a long shot. 

•	&gt;If reusing any parts, what parts will you be reusing? Please be especially specific about the power supply. List make and model. If you have a monitor, list the size/resolution.

I have access to a 15 in monitor but not sure of make or model or a 22 in dell also unsure of model. The PSU is a corsair and another PSU to decide between. Sorry for the lack of information but at work filling this out between patients. 

•	&gt;Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?

Not at all, I need it to be stable and strong not a gaming rig.

•	&gt;If there's any specific features you want/need from the rig, please list them. Examples might include rear and/or front-panel USB 3.0, a RAID setup, etc.

None

•	&gt;Do you have any specific case/tower preferences such as a window or LEDs, or do you have a preference for low-noise components?

None, in fact it would be better to have no lights, not windows, just vents. 

•	&gt;Do you already have a legit and reusable/transferable OS key/license? If yes, what OS?

I believe I need to find an OS and it must be windows professional either 7 or 8. Could someone send me a few reviews of 8 if they know of some good ones to read/watch. I feel unsure about 8 since I am running 7 on the server pc up front.

I will be using this PC mostly for gaming, but I do use some other programs as well.  I use a bit of Photoshop and Sony Vegas but other then that I'm gaming or just surfing the web.

&gt;What is your maximum preferred budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?

Maximum is probably 500$, maybe 600$.  I want to get the most performance for that amount.

&gt;When do you plan on building/buying the PC? (note: if you're planning on buying more than 2 weeks from now, it's very much recommended you wait and come back then, to ensure you get the most recent and accurate price data)

I know the note says that I should wait as I want to build this at the latest by the end of the year, but I just want to get an idea of my build.  At the earliest I see myself purchasing and building this at the ends of the summer, at the latest, during the holidays so around December.  

&gt;What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? ""Everything"" is not specific enough. Tower, Operating System, peripherals like the keyboard, mouse, and monitor(s), wifi adapter, speakers/headphones, etc. are all relevant.

CPU (Quad Core), Motherboard, Case, Power Supply, RAM (8 GB), SSD, HDD

&gt;Which country will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in the US, are you near a Microcenter store?

USA, not near a Microcenter store.

&gt;If reusing any parts, what parts will you be reusing? Please be especially specific about the power supply. List make and model. If you have a monitor, list the size/resolution.

Monitor ((I have two of 'em): One is a 21 inch Acer Monitor at 1080p, while the other is a 15 inch Compaq monitor at 1024x768), Keyboard, Mouse, Speakers, Headset, Disk Drive, 

&gt;Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?

Maybe, depends if the hardware makes it easy.  If not, then most likely I won't worry about it for a while.  Maybe both CPU and GPU if they work with it.

&gt;If there's any specific features you want/need from the rig, please list them. Examples might include rear and/or front-panel USB 3.0, a RAID setup, etc.

Definitely want 8 GB of RAM, also want a Quad Core Intel or the equivalent power in an AMD CPU.  

&gt;Do you have any specific case/tower preferences such as a window or LEDs, or do you have a preference for low-noise components?

None at all, I just care that it fits everything and doesn't look atrocious.  Also can't be more than $50. 

&gt;Do you already have a legit and reusable/transferable OS key/license? If yes, what OS?

Yes, Windows 7 Professional.

&gt;Which country will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in the US, are you near a Microcenter store?

United States.  I am not near a microcenter, however there is one back home and I will be visiting there in a month or so.  If it would save me a significant amount of money ($100+) I would wait until then to build.

&gt;If reusing any parts, what parts will you be reusing?

Not reusing any parts.

&gt;Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?

I would be interested but probably not right away.  I would rather have a CPU and GPU capable of running what I want off the bat (Rome 2 and Solidworks) and overclock later if necessary to keep it relevant.

&gt;If there's any specific features you want/need from the rig, please list them. Examples might include rear and/or front-panel USB 3.0, a RAID setup, etc.

Nothing I have in mind but I am very new to PC's (have been a long time mac user) and would welcome suggestions on what is important.

Just cheap and powerful.  Quiet wouldn't hurt but isnt huge on my priority list.

&gt;Do you already have a legit and reusable/transferable OS key/license? If yes, what OS?

- Nope

&gt;If there's any specific features you want/need from the rig, please list them. Examples might include rear and/or front-panel USB 3.0, a RAID setup, etc.

- I'd like USB ports in the front of the computer case along with a headphone jack if possible. I also need a video card that will run a triple monitor set up that all have DVI so I presume a video with 2 dvi outputs and hdmi output would be necessary.

&gt;Do you have any specific case/tower preferences such as a window or LEDs, or do you have a preference for low-noise components?

- Just a nice mid tower case with maybe some blue LEDs for show and it has to be all black. I'm also a sucker for fans all over the place.

Try to list as many games/applications that you'll be using as you can, as well as your performance goals for those programs.

Customized (and mostly personally written) mathematical physics codes. All are processor intensive (need dual Xeons), some are very RAM intensive (~64 GB of RAM). Will need a large (&gt; 4-6 TB) secure (raid 1) array to save backup data to. I do some (non-intense) CUDA programming (so need an nvidia card) -- but I have access to very high end cards if a large project comes up. Will use 2 large monitors, but screen real-estate is more important than monitor quality (not dealing with any images).

Otherwise, I just do web surfing, downloading files, maybe playing nba tv in the background - things that should be entirely trivial for any pc of this size.

Also need a large case -- current PC started with 4 HDs, now has 9 in it (due to some expansions) - need a case/power supply that can handle that sort of expansion (e.g. possibly the addition of a Tesla card if a relevant project comes up)

&gt;What is your maximum preferred budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?

About $5500 USD, though $5000 USD would be preferable. By a weird quirk, the total cost MUST be at least $5k.

&gt;When do you plan on building/buying the PC? (note: if you're planning on buying more than 2 weeks from now, it's very much recommended you wait and come back then, to ensure you get the most recent and accurate price data)

I will wait until the new Xeon cards come out (since they will be a huge upgrade)- and will probably buy the most expensive card that fits in the budget for this thing. That being said, I need to submit pricing ideas soon, so I want to get most of the rest of the build together.

&gt;What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? ""Everything"" is not specific enough. Tower, Operating System, peripherals like the keyboard, mouse, and monitor(s), wifi adapter, speakers/headphones, etc. are all relevant.

This is a clean build. If necessary I could keep my current tower case -- but because I own that and the university will own this, that's not preferable. I don't need an OS (will use Linux). I do need a keyboard and mouse - but if you don't bother to include them here, it's no big deal.

&gt;Which country will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in the US, are you near a Microcenter store?

US, could be near a microcenter store if that helps with prices, otherwise probably newegg or amazon.

&gt;If reusing any parts, what parts will you be reusing? Please be especially specific about the power supply. List make and model. If you have a monitor, list the size/resolution.

Not reusing any parts.

&gt;Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?

Xeons don't really overclock well, so probably not. 

&gt;If there's any specific features you want/need from the rig, please list them. Examples might include rear and/or front-panel USB 3.0, a RAID setup, etc.

If the parts are OS X compatible - I might try a Hackintosh at some point - since some key programs are pre-configured for OS X. But this is not a deal killer, and with the new Xeon chips, I don't think anybody knows how it will work out.

&gt;Do you have any specific case/tower preferences such as a window or LEDs, or do you have a preference for low-noise components?

Yes - low noise components (will be in a shared office) - cool enough that I can leave for two weeks with the processors cranking 24/7 and not worry about it. Would rather have the case be somewhat non-descript, since office theft is always a risk -- so no LEDs, or case windows.

&gt;Do you already have a legit and reusable/transferable OS key/license? If yes, what OS?

Linux, might do a hackintosh if it works out.

&gt;Extra info or specifics:

If you throw in a current line of Xeon chips, I can reconfigure later for the new line of Xeons (whatever ends up at the same price point).

I have ~30 SATA hard drives that need wiping.  Ideally I'd like the most basid rig that can complete the job in as little time as possible, meaning as many drives at once as possible.

The limiting factor isn't the processor or the memory, but rather the power supply, case, and sata bus.

Ive been lurking in this sub for a while now and have seen some decent builds for people with similar wants and budgets as me but figured i should ask for a build anyway.  

&gt;What will you be doing with this PC? Gaming? Photoshop? Web browsing? 

Mainly gaming.  I want to get back into strategy games and will probably play BF4 and big RPGs.  I want to play games on ultra for as long as possible and will be down to upgrade/add/OC parts when the time comes.  I will also use this rig as my main media center for my TV, netflix, music, etc.  I might occasionally bring work home with me and have to deal with some CAD files etc.  Focus on the gaming though!


&gt;What is your maximum preferred budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?

About 1800, I am a little flexible if its worth it.  

&gt;When do you plan on building/buying the PC?

Next week, I can wait a few more weeks if anything big is about to be released. 

&gt;What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? 

Tower, OS (not sure about windows 7 or 8), wireless keyboard/mouse.  I plan on playing on my 42 inch plasma on my couch.  Any comments for or against this are welcome, but as of now I am not planning on getting a monitor.  I've got a work laptop, tablets etc for reddit and text heavy things like that.  Also does anyone have any recommendations on lap setups on the couch? lol  I will probably hard-wire the ethernet.

&gt;Which country will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in the US, are you near a Microcenter store?

USA, microcenter is 30 mins away, but if its not that big of a saving, i will be content with newegg/amazon etc.  

&gt;If reusing any parts, what parts will you be reusing? Please be especially specific about the power supply. List make and model. If you have a monitor, list the size/resolution.

Nothing but my 42 (i think that's the size) HD TV.  

&gt;Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?

I don't have experience with this but it is something I might be interested in down the line if a quick google search can teach me how.

Haswell please, and everything as futureproof as possible (I bet you hear that a lot).  Lots of cheap and reliable SSD space and probably should get a TB HDD or so.

I was thinking Rosewill THOR V2 Gaming ATX Full http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811147053

     I would be playing games on the PC.  I am a teacher, so I might bring work home.  I mainly want it to be as close to max settings to the current videogames out there, and room for improvement in the future.

&gt;What is your maximum preferred budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?

     I don't mind rebates, but I would like for the total cost to be around $1000 US.

&gt;What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? ""Everything"" is not specific enough. Tower, Operating System, peripherals like the keyboard, mouse, and monitor(s), wifi adapter, speakers/headphones, etc. are all relevant.

     The only things that I have at home are the monitor, headphones and a mouse.  I need everything else.  I would like to have wifi and Windows 8 64 bit.  I don't know the difference of regular and professional, but if it will help gaming or teaching I would pay for it.  I would like for alot of room for ram, maybe up to 32 GB, but I think 8 GB should be fine for now.  I also want 1 TB, but if it is not that more expensive I would like to get to 2 TB.  Pretty much if it can help make my computer run smooth, I will pay.

&gt;Which country will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in the US, are you near a Microcenter store?

     I will be purchasing parts in the US.  Not near a Microcenter, in Southwest Wisconsin.  

&gt;If reusing any parts, what parts will you be reusing? Please be especially specific about the power supply. List make and model. If you have a monitor, list the size/resolution.

     I will not be reusing parts.

     I don't have experience with overclocking, so no.

&gt;If there's any specific features you want/need from the rig, please list them. Examples might include rear and/or front-panel USB 3.0, a RAID setup, etc.
     I would like for a USB ports in front and back of the machine.  I would like for one port for a SD card.  Audio ports for a microphone headset in front.  Audio port in back just in case if I want to add speakers.  Ethernet port in back.  Any suggestions that will improve gaming will be fine.

&gt;Do you have any specific case/tower preferences such as a window or LEDs, or do you have a preference for low-noise components?

     I would like for the tower to help with air flow, so it won't overheat.  Second, I would like for my computer to be quiet.  I really don't care if it looks good or not.  I would not mind window on the side, but if it adds alot more to the budget, I'll pass.  I would like to add stickers to the tower as well.

&gt;Do you already have a legit and reusable/transferable OS key/license? If yes, what OS?

     Nope.

* Almost entirely gaming. My current primary game is Battlefield 3 but I play a variety of games. I'm switching from XB360 but I've wanted to for awhile... Its not just the buzz around XBone. I'd like ultra settings on BF4 and maybe Planetside 2 if they are achievable.

&gt;Do you have any specific case/tower preferences such as a window or LEDs, or do you have a preference for low-noise components?


* Low noise is preferable, white noise is ok but it shouldn't be as loud as an old AC unit or anything. The less LEDs the better. Functionality is 99% to 1% Aesthetics .


&gt;Do you already have a legit and reusable/transferable OS key/license? If yes, what OS?


* I've used a Windows XP MC Edition Dvd on my laptop for about 8 years... I just port over my files to a drive and fresh install about every other year... Windows 8 is fine but there is no preference really.

* I'm willing to wait on things like the keyboard, mouse, monitor, etc. until a deal pops up. I have old ones laying around that I can use for a few weeks in the meantime. I want one big monitor, good for gaming and I'll be getting the Oculus Rift when it finally releases.

&gt; The US, Colorado to be exact. Decently close to a Microcenter

Are you reusing any parts?
&gt; No

Overclocking?
&gt; Yes, most likely. Once I do research.

Any features specifically?
&gt; Not particularly no, other than the sound card mentioned earlier. Just a top notch, 100% beast of a gaming PC.

Case, any specifications?
&gt;Something that looks sleek, nothing else really. I'd like it to be a piece of eye candy.

Operating System? 
&gt; No key.

web browsing, but most importantly gaming and lots of it. I want to run crysis, skyrim, fallout, hitman, saints row, dishonored, GTA4, BF3, ARMA/DAYZ, minecraft, bioshock, garrys mod, portal, mw3, forza motorsport 4, splinter cell... lots of games!

$1000 give or take

end of the week after my paycheck

Im in the US, florida.

i have a 1080p TV, but would a monitor be better? if so suggest away!

I may be? I dont want to break anything, maybe if there is a ""safe"" overclock i would do it.

usbs, hdmi, 3.0 usb would be nice. 


&gt;Do you have any specific case/tower preferences such as a window or LEDs, or do you have a preference for low-noise components? 

LEDs are cool but not necessary, a case that wont break the bank, since whats in it is more important.

yes,  windows 7

&gt;What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? ""Everything"" is not specific enough. Tower, Operating System, peripherals like the keyboard, mouse, and monitor(s), wifi adapter, speakers/headphones, etc. are all relevant.

&gt;I will be using the PC for gaming, browsing the web, and as a media center/TV replacement. I will be moving soon and might not have a TV for a while, so I will be using the PC to watch and stream a lot. List of programs: Netflix and Xfinity for streaming; and GTA IV, eventually GTA V, Max Payne 3, Empire: Total War, Shogun 2: Total War, Bioshock Infinite, Civilization V, Watch Dogs, and others. For the games, I would hope to play some of the latest games on the highest settings to start with the knowledge that I will have to lower settings over time. 

* What is your maximum preferred budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?

&gt;My preferred budget is **$1300**.

* When do you plan on building/buying the PC? 

&gt;I hope to go to Microcenter and place my orders online any day now.

* What, exactly, do you need included in the budget?

&gt;I need tower and all components, wireless dongle, monitor, mouse, keyboard, and speakers.

* Which country will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in the US, are you near a Microcenter store?

&gt;I live in the U.S. and I live near a Microcenter. Also, I would prefer as many online purchases as possible to go through Amazon because I have prime and store credit from them.

* Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?

&gt;I may overclock eventually when I notice the performance slipping. But I have a high tolerance for that, so it is by no means imminent.

* Do you have any specific case/tower preferences such as a window or LEDs, or do you have a preference for low-noise components?

&gt;If there is another color besides black prominent in the case, I would prefer it to be blue.

* Do you already have a legit and reusable/transferable OS key/license? If yes, what OS?

&gt;I might have a Windows 7 disc, but I am not sure whether it's 32 or 64 bit. If it is the former, I will buy Windows 8 with a student discount and that price is not included in my desired maximum.

* Extra info or specifics:

&gt;What other items will I need for the build itself? Any special screw drivers, ties for wires, or anything? 

I am coming from a crummy six year old laptop that cannot fully satisfy my desires for gaming or stress-free browsing. I would say this gives a decent tolerance for mediocre performance. I hope to keep this build as long as I can or until it gives out and can't play the games I want anymore. I would hope that this build would also serve as a good platform to potentially upgrade CPU (or overlock) or GPU eventually. Nonetheless, I am very excited to build my own computer and reap the benefits of a better machine.

Down the line...

USB 3.0 on the front or some kind of media reader that I could plug in to the computer and leave the box on my desk for easy access. If that can manage sound and headphone jacks would be cool too.

Anything from gaming to video editing. Games such as Planetside 2, Battlefield 3, and Guild Wars 2 just to name a few.

$2000 total budget, not afraid to go over by a hundred or so.

I'm pretty sure you can buy all these parts now and I don't think i can wait for Haswell or Gtx 770.
&gt;What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? ""Everything"" is not specific enough. Tower, Operating System, peripherals like the keyboard, mouse, and monitor(s), wifi adapter, speakers/headphones, etc. are all relevant. 

I am starting from scratch so I need the case, cpu, gpu, ram (maybe not since I can download some more), storage drives, psu,monitor, I would also like speakers, a mouse, and keyboard. I want an ssd boot drive and a high capacity hard drive and probably an ssd for caching. Also I need a wifi adapter and maybe a good headset and sound card. Also as many bells and whistles you can because I guess it is beter to have and not use than to need and not have.

&gt;Which country will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in the US, are you near a Microcenter store?

I am relatively close to one.

&gt;If there's any specific features you want/need from the rig, please list them. Examples might include rear and/or front-panel USB 3.0, a RAID setup, etc.

Usb 3.0 please and I am also wonder if I need a raid card I get another ssd and put it in raid 0.
&gt;Do you have any specific case/tower preferences such as a window or LEDs, or do you have a preference for low-noise components?

I really like the sleek design of the NZXT Phantom 820. LEDs and different colored ram might look cool. I like Low noise at night, but don't mind noise to get maximum performance.
 
&gt;Do you already have a legit and reusable/transferable OS key/license? If yes, what OS?

I wish.

I also have a build that I looked into, and would like to get an opinion on it and if it is any good?

I'm reposting with the hope that you can help me out -- with a ***reward!***  The top post gets a cup of coffee!  I'll send a $10 Starbucks gift card to the highest rated post so they can relax with a cup of joe, knowing they've unleashed a wondrous machine upon the world.   Thanks!

Rig details below:

-----

After lurking forever, this nerd needs a new gaming PC.  Details below.

**Used for? :**  Heavy gaming - full frame rate wherever possible.  Plan on playing FP games like Arkham City, Bioshock Infinite, and Crysis.  They've been sitting on my Steam shelf because my current machine stutters when they load.

Also planning mild video editing -- putting family videos together, not making block busters.

Also plan on spawning Virtual machines for programming.

These won't be running concurrently though


**Maximum prefered budget:**  $2000 is fine but willing to go into debt for higher.

**When?:**  Next couple weeks.....who am I kidding, tomorrow!!

**What do you need:**  Outsides:  24"" monitor, keyboard and mouse, no speakers, WiFi dongle

Insides:  CPU, graphics cards -- would like to run 3 monitors someday but not now so if I just need 1 card but slots for 2 (or 3), I'll take that.  16GB memory, Bluray drive, Fan (would like to stay away from liquid), SSD drive for OS, uber-TB drive for games, downloads, stuff. 

**Country:**  US;  I'm 2 hours from a MicroCenter so if it saves &gt;$200, I'd consider.

**Reuse:**  Nothing 

**Overclocking:**  Interested but not doing it for a long long time, with another machine in tow as backup.

**Features:**  Front USB would be nice;  no RAID;  

**OS License:**  No, but would need 64 Bit Windows (7 or 8);  and need professional because I need to backup to a network drive

**Extra info:**  Back when everyone just pointed you to Incremental Build, I was eyeing the Outstanding build, which 
seemed like it would run all current games at highest-max-values and framerate possible, but not be the 
Biggest Rig on the Block.

Looking at the site now, it states that Outstanding runs BF3 at 4 1/2 stars and Crysis at 4 (out of 5 ) stars.
I would like to run these games at 5 but not have a huge mongo-machine.  I don't need bragging rights -- I just
don't want to see video stutter or pixelated backgrounds for a year or two.

All help greatly apprec!

**Edit the First:**  Thanks all -- very good builds so far.   I will look at the up/down votes on Monday and use the [Wilson Score](http://www.evanmiller.org/how-not-to-sort-by-average-rating.html) to rank them.  Ties will be decided by a man-eating randomizer.

**Update the second:**  OP delivering late - I've tallied the scores and want to congratulate Evan5567 as winner.

I fibbed -- I am not just giving a gift card to Evan5567 but am also giving 1 month  reddit gold to those who contributed top level comments.    

Sadly, this didn't go as I'd hoped -- see my comments to eagleslanding below.  But from the main post, I want to give my thanks to everyone who contributed!  Thank you!!!

2. Budget: $450

3. I plan to build in about 3 weeks: however, the reason that I only need a few parts is because I have been picking up other parts at good prices. If you tell me what you think would be good for my build, then I'll keep an eye out for those parts then pick them up accordingly.

4. I live close enough to a Microcenter! I also have Shoprunner for Newegg.

5. I already have a HDD, optical disc drive, operating system, and [these 2x4GB RAM sticks I bought when they were $42](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0098WZV1Y/ref=oh_details_o01_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)

6. **As the title states, I will only need: CPU/Mother board/GPU/Case/PSU**

7. . I have some Amazon credit left over, and I wouldn't mind making use of it. But if nothing on Amazon is at a decent price, I'll just spend it on other things!

8. I'm scared of overclocking but if somebody holds my hand through it, sure why not!

Some specific questions: 

What makes for a good computer case?

Is HD7790 looking like it's pretty good?

If it could pick up wifi, that would also be appreciated.  We live in rural, northern Japan, it all parts will have to be ordered online and shipped to an APO address.

This PC will be used mainly for gaming and some possible 3D modeling in the future as well as basic Office programs for work. I’m hoping to run most modern games, such as Skyrim, Far Cry 3, Crysis 3, etc. on high to ultra settings. Also want to be able to run future games such as Archeage and Star Citizen in similar ranges.

**What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? ""Everything"" is not specific enough. Just the tower? Operating System? Keyboard, mouse, monitor, speakers/headset, WiFi adapter, etc?**

CPU, CPU cooler, Motherboard, Memory, SSD/HDD, Video Card, Case, Power Supply, OS, Monitors (dual, around 23” range), and any other necessary cooling solutions or miscellaneous parts.

**Which country will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in the US, are you near a Microcenter store?**

United States. I do have access to a Microcenter store.

**If reusing any parts, what parts will you be reusing? Please be especially specific about the power supply. List make and model. If you have a monitor, list the size/resolution.**

I will be using a Razer Blackwidow Ultimate 2013 keyboard, a Razer Naga 2012 mouse, and a Gamecom 780 headset. I do have a 23"" 1900x1080 Acer monitor that is about two years old, but I'm not sure it is up to graphic fidelity I would like.

**Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line?**

Yes, I will be doing moderate overclocking as soon as possible.

**If there's any specific features you want/need from the rig, please list them. Examples might include rear and/or front-panel USB 3.0, a RAID setup, etc.**

A SSD is required, preferably large enough for the OS and a number of games, and a decent sized HDD (500GB-1TB). Some USB 3.0 capability would be nice, whether it is front-panel, rear, or both would be nice, but a minimum of 5 USB slots between front and back is necessary. As I believe my Gamecom 780 has 7.1 digital audio, I would prefer to have 7.1 sound options, but 5.1 would be acceptable if necessary.

**Do you already have a legit and reusable/transferable OS key/license? If yes, what OS? Is it 32bit or 64bit?**

I do not have a reusable/transferable OS license. I currently use a 64bit Windows 7 OS, but I am also willing to try Windows 8.

I’m pretty biased toward going Intel/Nvidia, so if you use AMD, I’d appreciate an explanation as to why besides, “It’s cheaper.” I really like the look and considerations in the Corsair 200R and 300R, but I’ve heard conflicting things about their build quality.

* Obviously, portable.  I'm partial to the cubes, but totally flexible on style.  Function over form, and all that. 
* As top-end as I can get in said case.  I know that I will sacrifice some power for portability, but I'd like to hit the max gaming specs that will fit the case and budget.
* Some home-theater options.  I don't watch much traditional TV, and would like to be able to hook up a good home entertainment system through my PC... 7.1 surround and an HDMI connection for video are preferable (though I am looking at big-screen monitors instead of big-screen TVs so HDMI may not be necessary).  Ooh, and a blu-ray drive.
*  Oh right, guidelines.  Purchasing in the US, not sure if I have access to a microcenter as I just arrived in the area.  Also, probably won't be overclocking in a SFF, so disregard that -- unless you guys suggest otherwise.  You're the pros here.

I have decided I'm tired of failing, buggy, PC's and I can't stand my almost brand new iMac. So I'm selling it all and taking control of my computer woes. I feel like screaming FREEEDOMMMM!!! I'm so excited about it.

So here's what I want. I want an awesome and powerful computer. I don't want to be held back because something is too expensive. I'd rather just wait a week or two until I get paid and then buy it, than to order something just because I can have it now. What I don't want is to spend stupid money. As in, I don't want to spend twice the money to get 2 percent better performance just because it's ""top of the line"". There has to be a logical and functional reason why I've decided to spend the big bucks. For example... but this part has racing stripes and limited edition glow in the dark paint for only twice as much! Not interested.

My ultimate goal is something that can play any game that I throw at it, I want it to be quiet, I want it to be awesome, and I want it to be capable of doing those three screen set ups that I always see on here that make me drool.

Here's what I have so far. Please tell me if I've done anything wrong and should return them.

Thanks!

Update: Went with the Intel Core i7-3820 3.6GHz Quad-Core Processor, hope I made the right choice... 

Update: OK I decided on the extreme6 MOBO and backordered it on Amazon. Maybe they're in high demand? Prefer to wait to get it from Amazon then order from others just because of the customer service factor. Thanks again everyone for your help. 

Update: So I've got most of the guts figured out now. Does anyone have any recommendations on what I should be looking for in a monitor? Like I said I'm going to end up with three, but I'm going to start with one and then add the other two in a few months. I don't think I care about 3d? Should I? Appreciate any advice thanks.

I use my computer for work all day, and would like a touchscreen monitor (i am aware of the advantages/disadvantages of this) and PC setup. What i mainly want to use it for is work, which is heavy web browsing and video watching (think 8 youtube tabs loading at the same time, that's often what my job entails). i'd like to game a little bit on it, but i'm not a graphics whore, so just being able to play games like counter strike, lol, or dota 2 at a reasonable setting would be good. 

A few points i would like to make: is it possible to get surround sound output from a computer? I would like a coax digital sound output but seeing as how rare those are (reason i would like a coax output ideally is because that's all that's 'open' on my surround sound receiver) idk if that's even possible, but most pcs i've seen don't even offer optical sound output, so i'll take what i can get. it has to work well with touchscreen/windows 8 because this is what i want to make work easier. 

A nice wireless kb/mouse recommendation would help too. Also i would prefer it to look nice, so more than one recommendation on a suitable case would be cool. i'll spend a little more if it'll look nicer for sure. One question i had was, fans. my laptop now sounds like a jet engine taking off and it's very annoying. Is a decent PC going to be loud all the time too, or can i minimize that fan whirring somehow? i plan on keeping the PC in the living room which is where all the other entertainment usually is. Because of that, i also need wireless compatability; I have 30 mbps internet and a n600 router, so i'd like to put that speed to use without wires, is there a way to incorporate that into the build? Or do i need to carry around a wireless adapter anytime i move the computer?

Ideally i would like to spend about $500 on the computer, and up to $300 on the touchscreen monitor, i'm flexible though and will spend more if it will fit my needs better.

Since I'm coming from a laptop, I'll need all the peripherals except an OS.

This is strictly for non-gaming, web browsing, music, normal everyday file work.  My main point of confusion which mobo/CPU combo would give me the best on board graphics, or if it even matters.  Every now and then I'll fire up AutoCAD/sketchup, but I'm not talking workstation requirements here.  I can muddle through AutoCAD ok on what I have now, so obviously I'm not talking real intense stuff.

Although I'm not real clear on where the AMD stuff falls...


Other things I want:

- SSD (how important is a running this on a mobo w/ 6gb/s vs. 3 gb/s?)  Storage size isn't too critical, as I'm just now filling up my 80GB.  I figure 128GB would probably suffice.  I could add a 7200rpm down the road.

- Highest resolution monitor possible.  I imagine this will be a good chunk of my budget.  I like a lot of real estate on my screen.  I guess around 21.5"" is 'normal'?

- Wireless keyboard/mouse that doesn't feel flimsy/cheap.

- USB 3.0 (thats the future right?)

- Should probably get a sub $20 cheapo DVD drive

Am I correct in that some of these cheaper CPUs(sandy bridge?) only support up to 1066 RAM?  Is that a big difference compared to 1333 or 1600?  I could still stick 1333 in there and it will run at 1066, right?  Also, is the amount of L3 cache that important for my application?

The requirements are this: We would like the price point as low or close to console (newer console pricings are fine; the PS3 was expensive at launch so our builds can be there as well) as possible while maintaining solid FPS and graphics qualities. I would say a good benchmark would be Skyrim at a solid framerate running high (not Ultra) settings. If this is impossible, I deign to your wisdom and suggestions. A form factor as close as possible to a console is a bonus. A tower wouldn't look great next to my media center and TV. :P

(Note: this post is also on /r/buidapc, but it seems like this is a better place to post this kind of thing)

Here's a list of the parts I've just selected from buildapc for my gaming desktop. As you can see from the title, I have absolutely no experience whatsoever when it comes to building computers, so all the parts listed above are just me hittin' the Google search for ""good gaming desktop insert computer part here. So, what do you see that could be improved? This is a $1.5K list here, so I want to make sure of the following things:
-everything will work together (i know it says at the top whether or not everything is compatible, but I want to hear it from a human rather than an automated block of code :))
-if this build will be able to run games. And I mean GAME games. And more than one at a time. I have two friends that I mainly play online with. One likes TF2, Gary's Mod, those kind of games. The other likes more serious games like AC3. I also like Skyrim, Dishonored, Prototype 2, things like that. I don't want to have to play on low quality graphic either, I want to play with everything set to max.
-this will last a long time (duh). nobody wants to spend more than a thousand dollars on something that won't last a while.
This part here is kind of off- topic, and I will probably end up getting flamed for the mere mentioning of Mac OS on a gaming desktop, but... I would like to dual-boot windows 7 home premium and some mac OS too (I've never had a Mac before so I don't know what the software is called). I know, I know, Mac has little to know games/ software available, but hear me out. Though my main purpose is gaming, I also run a (unsuccessful, so far) YouTube channel that I enjoy making and editing videos for. My friend, who owns a Mac, has several Mac exclusive video editing software that I want to have for myself. So that's really all I will be using Mac for.
So, that's my post. I haven't read that many posts on here, so I don't really know how long they generally are, so I'll just say, thanks for reading my (seemingly) long post, and I hope you can bear with my most likely noob-ish questions! ~Papalonian",,False,self,t5_2tjcr,False,,,True,t3_14kj73,http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcforme/comments/14kj73/help_with_building_my_first_gaming_pc/,

Anyway, I have a basic undersand of what I want my computer to do, but I'm not entirely sure about prices and stuff.

Money isn't really an issue, but I'm a bit frugal (read: cheap) and so I want to get the best deal I can for the lowest price.  I want to build a gaming rig, it doesn't have to be the best in the world but I want it to be able to run pretty much anything on medium or higher.  Skyrim doesn't have to be at its best, but if the price is right I want to get the best graphics card possible.  I would also be interested in hooking it up to my HDTV for steam big box.

Price wise, that is up to you.  My question I guess is when the diminishing results start to occur. I've seen plenty of gaming rigs that claim to do skyrim on high for like 500-600 dollars, and I want to know what makes a 900 or even a 2000 dollar computer so much better?

Other than that, it needs to be able to run modeling software decently well, and I would be interested in at least discussing a wireless option.

As of now, I've been doing some pretty heavy audio and video editing on my 2009 macbook pro, but the ability to upgrade it is essentially zero (I quadrupled the ram with not much change). Alas, I've decided it's time to build a dedicated machine for audio and video editing (that's right, little/no internet or gaming or any of that nonsense!)    

I've read through a few of the tutorials and looked through the PC Part Picker website, but am still incredibly lost and everything looks french. I'm about to watch the two hour video that's posted in the thread in the sidebar, but am fearful that newer technology may have changed much of the information. If anyone can point me to a recent build like this or directly help me out, that would be amazing! My price point is probably going to be $900 and maybe... MAYBE up to $1000. I already have one monitor that I've been using as secondary for my Macbook, so I won't immediately need a monitor included in the build.    

Audio editing - I'll be using DAWS and doing some live recording with them. Something that runs quietly would be awesome. I have some external soundcards that I'll be using, but I'm not sure if that's fine to do, or if I should purchase a super cheap one that's always mounted in the computer.    

Video editing - I'll be doing HD videos, long hours of editing, and in the past full day renders (which I'm trying to avoid now...) I may end up working with 4 or 5k raw eventually. As well, I'd love to be able to work with 3d footage if this is an important thing to keep in mind (again, the monitor can be ignored, as I'll most likely purchase a matching one to what I have, and then a 3d monitor for the center). Also... Blueray Burner?    

The Redditor who referred me here, also suggested the Core i7 2600k/3770k with a Noctua NH-L12 cooler.  Thoughts?

I am happy to pay for premium parts as long as they have advanced performance. In saying this, I don't want to pay for an expensive part when a cheaper part could perform just as efficiently (I'm a noob builder so don't have an idea on general costs of specific parts).
So I'd say around $2000 to over-estimate.

But again, Performance &gt; Appearance!

&gt;What will you be doing with this PC? Gaming? Photoshop? Web browsing? etc.

I am looking for a high-end gaming PC that can run popular, modern games on ultra settings with ease. I can settle for high settings if the budget demands it, but i extremely prefer ultra so i don't have to upgrade for the next several years.

Games are, but not limited to:

* TESV: Skyrim
* Crysis 3
* GTA: V (not released)
* Battelfield: 4 (not released)


&gt;What is your maximum preferred budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?

$900-$1000 (maybe i can get together another $100, but $1100 is my definite max.)

&gt;When do you plan on building/buying the PC?

Within the next several weeks, so i can prepare and understand how/what im suppose to do (i've only replaced my gpu and power supply before).

&gt;What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? 

* Operating System &lt;
* Tower
* Monitor &lt;
* Gaming Keyboard (something nice like razer, but doesn't have a huge unnecessary price like razer) &lt;
* Gaming Mouse (something nice like razer, but doesn't have a huge unnecessary price like razer)

Note: If any of the ones marked with a ""&lt;"" unnecessarily affect my budget affecting my performance, i can use my older ones.

&gt;Which country will you be purchasing the parts in? 

The United States of America! Unfortunately no microcenter stores are located within 2 hours of me, so that purchasing online is a very preferred option! 

&gt;If reusing any parts, what parts will you be reusing? 

I would very much like to start from scratch but, again, performance is the priority in my budget.

If needed:

* Old monitors resolution is 1366x768
* I have 1tb of memory, but do not know how/what to do to move it to a different pc.
* I have a Windows 7 OS, but do not know how/what to do to move it to a different pc.

&gt;Will you be overclocking?

Unless it can affect my budget and performance for the better and this specific gpu/cpu is easy to overclock (tutorials, less chance of breaking, equipped for ocing, etc.), then no.

&gt;If there's any specific features you want/need from the rig, please list them. Examples might include rear and/or front-panel USB 3.0, a RAID setup, etc.

I don't know what USB 3.0 is, or if its any different from just a regular usb port, nor do i know what a RAID setup is, but i'm going to list what i assume they correlate to and what my current pc has.

* 2 Front panel USB ports
* 2 Back panel USB ports. Maybe 3. I have a wired mouse, keyboard, and wireless router that i hook to my computer 
* CD Drive
* 2 Audio jacks, one for inputting sound, and another for outputting

Im looking for the same kind of setup as [this](http://i.dell.com/das/xa.ashx/global-site-design%20WEB/90dc81c7-50d2-75b6-d4d5-ba22c2db40e5/1/OriginalPng?id=Dell/Product_Images/Dell_Client_Products/Desktops/Inspiron_Desktops/Inspiron_660/Overview/desktop-inspiron-660-designtab-ports-details-v3.jpg). Im talking amount wise and part wise, not position.

&gt;Do you have any specific case/tower preferences such as a window or LEDs, or do you have a preference for low-noise components?

I think windows and LED's are sick, but if they really affect my budget i can settle for a bleak plain tower. 

Low noise is less of a preference, but again, the performances and sticking to my budget is a priority. 

I'd rather have the LED's and windows, but if my system without low noise would be give jet engine noise a run for its money, then low noise is a definite. 

If i could have all 3, that would be amazing, but i want this to be a gaming computer, not eyecandy (we'll leave the eyecandy for the games haha).

&gt;Do you already have a legit and reusable/transferable OS key/license? If yes, what OS?

Im not sure, i have a computer already with the windows 7 operating system, and i would like it very much if i could transfer that and along with all my memory (1 terabyte) to my new system. I would like it even more if i was able to reuse the memory and the OS without it affecting my pc's performance.

&gt;Extra info or specifics:

I've only ever replaced, never built.

Since I already have a laptop and a desktop for all my non-gaming needs, this PC should have just one function... to produce the best possible gaming graphics for the **Oculus Rift**. Meaning...

* The case can be ugly as sin. 
* I don't need a wireless card. 
* I don't need an optical drive. 
* I don't need an SSD. 

* If you told me a quad core produced the same graphic quality as a dual core, I'd take the dual and spend the money on a bigger video card. 

* If you said an i5 had the same frame rate as an i7, I'd take the i5 and buy a better cooling system.

* If the producers of BioShock Infinite and GTA V announced tomorrow they were releasing versions for the Oculus Rift, not only would I want my machine to handle these games, I'd want it to handle them at 60fps. 

While the Rift's resolution is low (720p), the close proximity of eye to screen makes the frame rate **SIGNIFICANTLY** more important, and the **TOP PRIORITY** for this build.

Basically, I want a gaming PC with the highest possible frames rate I can afford. 

Thanks in advance!!

**UPDATE:** So I went ahead with [THIS](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcforme/comments/1jgdmd/1400_for_an_oculus_rift_pc_fps_top_priority/cbem8y4) configuration (Thanks again, teaearlgraycold). Over the weekend, I received the CPU, motherboard, memory, case, power supply, and assembled everything yesterday (except for the Hard Drive and dual graphics cards which should arrive today). 

Did I mention this is my first time building, much less owning a PC? (I've disassembled and reassembled my Macs before. But nothing like this). By following the directions in each manual, and using [THIS YOUTUBE VIDEO](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_56kyib-Ls&amp;list=FLFFpEj_vOLwkOP7xO8xO45g) as a guide, it went fairly smoothly. Here are some of my impression...


* Installing the CPU into the Motherboard was the funnest part. Felt like James Bond (dis)arming a nuclear warhead. 

* Deciphering the parts, wires, and components of the case was a challenge. The manual is just a xerox and takes some concentration. On top of that, the manual got a lot of it wrong (see more about that below).  

* The only hard part of installing the RAM memory was figuring out which slots to use (Dual Channel Memory Technology). This was the only part of the motherboard manual that used ""tech speak"" instead of plain English. HOPEFULLY, I GOT IT RIGHT.

* The power supply should have been the easiest part. But the manual (which is not very impressive) left out one very important step. Do I place the power supply fan side up or fan side down? Whoever wrote their manual must think this so obvious that they don't even address it. Not even with a picture showing the unit properly seated inside a case. I had to watch several youtube videos before I learned that it can go either way, depending on whether or not there's a fan grate on the bottom of the case. Mine has one, so I went with FAN SIDE DOWN. HOPE THAT WAS RIGHT.

* The hardest part of the entire build is connecting each and every wire and cable from each and every component to the right pins on the motherboard. The components with the worst manuals (the case) were the hardest. 

* Apparently, connecting the case's power button, reset button, and LED wires from the front panel to the motherboard is notoriously confusing in every build. Even when the manual doesn't get it wrong. 

HERE ARE SOME EXAMPLES OF PROBLEMS I ENCOUNTERED WITH THE CASE: 

* Each front panel cable in the case is made up of two wires (colored and black) and ends in two pin ports. Some of the ports are marked ""+"" and ""-"". Some aren't. Meanwhile, the pins on the motherboard are labeled as positive, negative, or GROUND. The case manual states that ""all BLACK pin connectors correspond to GROUND."" But some of the black wired ports are marked as negative ""-"" opposed to the other port marked positive ""+"". So which is it? Or do ""-"" and GROUND mean the same thing? This gets even more confusing when looking for the corresponding pins on the motherboard, where pins are marked as ""+"", ""-"" or GROUND. Confused? I sure as hell was. HOPE I GOT IT RIGHT!

* The manual warns to ""always attach the WHITE wire to ground."" But there is no WHITE wire. What the hell are they talking about?

* There are TWO separate pin ports on the motherboard designated for the ""P+LED and P-LED"" front panel wires. So which port is the right one? Even more confusing, the motherboard ports have THREE pins (+, -, and ground), while the LED wires only have two ports (+, -). If GROUND and ""-"" are the same thing, which do I choose? If ground and ""-"" aren't the same thing, did I do the other connections wrong? HOPE I GOT IT RIGHT! 

* The case manual identifies each of its wires by color and the written word along its plug. (Example: The manual states ""The Power Button wire is purple and black, and marked ""PWR"". Connect it to the pins your motherboard manual has designated for the Power Button"". But the wire marked ""PWR"" is green not purple. The manual doesn't even list a green wire. I went with marking over color. HOPE I WAS RIGHT! 


Here's a list of DO NOT DO's I was unaware of until now:

* DO NOT lay your motherboard on the anti-static bag that it came in, as the outside of the bag can actually cause static! Throw it away the moment you remove the board.

* Do not screw your motherboard directly onto the case. Included with your case should be a bag of little brass screws called STAND-OFFS. Take a piece of paper and mark where each of the screw holes are on your motherboard. Lay the paper in your case where the motherboard will go, and find the screw holes that line up with each mark. Screw a brass stand-off into each marked hole in the case. DO NOT USE MORE STAND-OFF SCREWS THAN THE MOTHERBOARD CALLS FOR. A STRAY STAND-OFF SCREW TOUCHING THE BACK OF THE MOTHERBOARD COULD SHORT THE ENTIRE BOARD!

* The motherboard manual will be your main manual. You will need the other manuals, but they all end up referring you to the motherboard manual. (EXAMPLE: Identify the power button wire in the front of your case by color and markings, and plug it into the pins designated by your motherboard manual). 

If anyone has a suggestion, feel free. Otherwise, I'll continue the build and keep you updated!

**UPDATE 2:** I installed the Hard Drive. Very easy. Then I installed both GeForce GTX 770 cards. Unfortunately the SLI Bridge card that came with my motherboard does not fit over the cards. (The bridge is a hard piece of board, and it won't fit around the card's bulky heat sink. I'll have to buy a bridge with a flexible band instead). Can I still boot with two unconnected video cards? Let's find out.

A mixture of video editing (Premiere and After Effects), Photoshopping, and medium-high end gaming (graphics setting). 

&gt;What is your maximum preferred budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?

I'm flexible, but would prefer not spending a copious amount of money. The cheaper the better! 

&gt;When do you plan on building/buying the PC? (note: if you're planning on buying more than 2 weeks from now, it's very much recommended you wait and come back then, to ensure you get the most recent and accurate price data)

Within the next two weeks.

&gt;What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? ""Everything"" is not specific enough. Tower, Operating System, peripherals like the keyboard, mouse, and monitor(s), wifi adapter, speakers/headphones, etc. are all relevant.

Tower, motherboard, RAM, CPU, video card, PSU, and monitor. I have an OS, keyboard, and mouse. 

&gt;Which country will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in the US, are you near a Microcenter store?

I'm located in Virginia and no Microcenter that I'm aware of.

&gt;If reusing any parts, what parts will you be reusing? Please be especially specific about the power supply. List make and model. If you have a monitor, list the size/resolution.

No reused parts except peripherals. 

&gt;Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?

No, thank you.

&gt;If there's any specific features you want/need from the rig, please list them. Examples might include rear and/or front-panel USB 3.0, a RAID setup, etc.

At least a 1080p resolution and that the hardware components aren't completely cramped in the tower. Perhaps a modular PSU?

&gt;Do you have any specific case/tower preferences such as a window or LEDs, or do you have a preference for low-noise components?

It doesn't have to be fancy or flashy. Just functional. I don't use many USB ports so a front-faced USB port is optional. The lower the noise and heat the better. 

&gt;Do you already have a legit and reusable/transferable OS key/license? If yes, what OS?

Microsoft Windows 7 Home Premium

No specific features.

&gt;Do you have any specific case/tower preferences such as a window or LEDs, or do you have a preference for low-noise components?

LED's are cool but not necessary, don't care what the tower looks like otherwise and sound isn't really a concern either.

Need OS, Windows 7 or 8 whichever is recommended.

First, I would like to start off by saying thank you for taking the time out of your day to help a fellow redditor with his first ever PC build! I have been researching building a PC for a few months now in order to familiarize myself with all the parts and I must say that this subreddit and BaPC are full of some of the most amazing and helpful people I know. By only reading your all's comments I feel I have learned a lot and I have full faith that you guys will be able to help me out!

As for the build, it will be relatively simple as I have decided on most of the specs I would like but am counting on one of you geniuses to put it all together.

* What will you be doing with this PC? Gaming? Photoshop? Web browsing? etc. If you need a Workstation, be specific on the programs you'll be using. Try to list as many games/applications that you'll be using as you can, as well as your performance goals for those programs.

To be honest, the only thing I want this computer to be able to do is play Battlefield 4 at Ultra settings on a 27"" 1440p monitor (I plan on purchasing the QNIX 2710 LED that is overclockable). If this build can do that I will be satisfied with everything else. I do plan on using ProE and CAD programs as well.

* What is your maximum preferred budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?

$2500 +/- $250 (not including the monitor - I have a separate budget for that)

* When do you plan on building/buying the PC? (note: if you're planning on buying more than 2 weeks from now, it's very much recommended you wait and come back then, to ensure you get the most recent and accurate price data)

ASAP

* What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? ""Everything"" is not specific enough. Tower, Operating System, peripherals like the keyboard, mouse, and monitor(s), wifi adapter, speakers/headphones, etc. are all relevant.

Tower and all the insides, keyboard, mouse 

* Which country will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in the US, are you near a Microcenter store?

Central US - not near a Microcenter

* If reusing any parts, what parts will you be reusing? Please be especially specific about the power supply. List make and model. If you have a monitor, list the size/resolution.

Reusing NO parts

* Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?

Yes, I want to overclock.

* If there's any specific features you want/need from the rig, please list them. Examples might include rear and/or front-panel USB 3.0, a RAID setup, etc.

Front USB would be nice. I also want this rig to be very quiet. I have some other things but I will list them in the specifics section. 

* Do you have any specific case/tower preferences such as a window or LEDs, or do you have a preference for low-noise components?

I am interested in the Fractal R4 w/ Window; I've heard nothing but good things and I hear it's quiet. If there is a similar design with a temperature readout on the front panel I would be interested in looking at that as well. 

* Do you already have a legit and reusable/transferable OS key/license? If yes, what OS?

No I do not but Windows 8 would be fine.

* Extra info or specifics:

Here is what my research has told me I want:

i7-4770k 3.5

Quiet CPU cooler - don't care fan or liquid

MSI Gaming Mobo w/ OC Genie

2x8 RAM - 1600

Samsung 840 Pro - 256GB SSD

1-2TB HD - don't care really

GTX 780 (will SLI in near future; if you can fit it now then by 
all means put it in here)

WiFi adapter

Fractal R4 w/ Window

At least 750 W PSU (Gold Cert would be nice)

Yes BluRay player

Windows 8

Keyboard (mechanical please; sidewinder looked nice but not mechanical so one like that but is mechanical would be awesome; also heard good things about the Ninja keyboards)

Logitech G500 Wired Laser Mouse would be fine


Alrighty, I know it seems like I might have an idea of what I want but this is where I need your all's expert opinion on how to make it work. Again, I thank you for your input and I can't wait to join the Master Race!

At the Moment I just want a computer that can at least handle most new games. I play anything from Minecraft to Planetside 2 to Civilization 5 to Battlefield 3 (and hopefully 4). I am willing and likely to upgrade some of the components in the next few years as I am going to Air Force BMT in September and will be in for 6 years minimum. I do not currently have a job and my Mom is currently funding this as a present for joining the Air Force so the Budget is kind of strict at the moment.

A quick pre-amble: The budget is largely to be determined based on what I need to spend to achieve my goals below. Probably the biggest thing I want is something VERY upgradable to scale with demands of games over the next few years. I was thinking of getting an SLI/CF compatible board, but just one card to start, and maybe dropping in another card (or two) in a year or so to really ramp things up. I'd really like to 'future-proof' this thing. A nice SSD drive is a must. For the video card, I've been looking at the GeForce 780, but I really don't have a sense anymore of if that's way overkill or in keeping with what I'm looking for. Anyway, here's the standard stuff:

&gt;What will you be doing with this PC? Gaming? Photoshop? Web browsing? etc. If you need a Workstation, be specific on the programs you'll be using. Try to list as many games/applications that you'll be using as you can, as well as your performance goals for those programs.

Gaming. I'm looking at games like Skyrim, Total War: Rome II, and, when it comes out, The Witcher 3. The Witcher is probably the main target: I want a system that will really rock it. I saw one developer interview that stated they were currently running it on Titans pre-optimazations which is why I was looking at the 780 as a (somewhat) cheaper alternative. Ideally I'd like to max settings for this game, assuming the cost of the comp isn't astronomical. Oh, and I'd like to max Crysis 3.

&gt;What is your maximum preferred budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?

Largely TBD based on feedback I get from this, but I could go as high as $2500-$3000 IFF I'm convinced that it's required to do what I'm aiming for, and that I'm not just throwing money away (Ex. as best as I can tell, Titans over the 780 is ~$400 more for only a slight increase).

&gt;When do you plan on building/buying the PC? (note: if you're planning on buying more than 2 weeks from now, it's very much recommended you wait and come back then, to ensure you get the most recent and accurate price data)

Sometime in the next 3 months. I may end up waiting to get better prices, but I'm still hoping to get an idea of what I'll be looking at.

&gt;What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? ""Everything"" is not specific enough. Tower, Operating System, peripherals like the keyboard, mouse, and monitor(s), wifi adapter, speakers/headphones, etc. are all relevant.

Full Tower, OS, wifi adapter. Please note that the video card must have display port as I'll be running the Apple Cinema Display with Thunderbolt connector.

&gt;Which country will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in the US, are you near a Microcenter store?

Canada. I've never heard of Microcenter, so no.

&gt;If reusing any parts, what parts will you be reusing? Please be especially specific about the power supply. List make and model. If you have a monitor, list the size/resolution.

Monitor: Apple Cinema Display with Thunderbolt, 27 in, 2560-by-1440
I also have headphones, keyboard and mouse.

&gt;Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?

Highly unlikely, so let's just say no.

&gt;If there's any specific features you want/need from the rig, please list them. Examples might include rear and/or front-panel USB 3.0, a RAID setup, etc.

SSD drive, SLI/CF capable, Displayport capable, upgradable.

&gt;Do you have any specific case/tower preferences such as a window or LEDs, or do you have a preference for low-noise components?

Low noise would be nice, but I'm guessing not really an option if I'm aiming for high power.

&gt;Do you already have a legit and reusable/transferable OS key/license? If yes, what OS?

No.

Perhaps some old school emulation, but not much demanding. It will be hooked up to my TV, but not via HDMI, so either VGA or dvi output is necessary (too much input lag on my TV through HDMI).

~$130 or below

Relatively soon, but I'm in no hurry.

Please assume what I have is compatible. I can check compatibility of my existing stuff. I have an old power supply, Ram and SATA hard drive.

No.

Price is the high priority on the case. Smaller would be better, but a really low price is much more important.

Yes. Windows 7.

My biggest question is whether there are better, but similarly (or lower) priced options out there.

I was intrigued by the AMD A4-4000, but I don't know how it compares to the intel cpu I have listed. Are there cheaper AMD options out there?  Something that will do the web-browsing job at the absolute cheapest price is what I'm after.

We're going to split the costs up by paychecks, so we'll buy a couple of parts every two weeks.

* **What will you be doing with this PC? Gaming? Photoshop? Web browsing? etc. If you need a Workstation, be specific on the programs you'll be using.**

Mostly running BF3/4, World of Tanks, War Thunder, Minecraft (far/exteme render distance, high res texture packs), etc. I'd like to record whilst playing at 40-60 FPS on High-Ultra (I'm not picky) for BF3. I'll be recording with FRAPS. I will also be rendering videos in Vegas and possibly derping around in a 3-D program such as Cinema 3D or something.


* **What is your maximum preferred budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?**

$800-$1000, although I'd really like to keep it on the lower end of that if possible...


* **When do you plan on building/buying the PC? (note: if you're planning on buying more than 2 weeks from now, it's very much recommended you wait and come back then, to ensure you get the most recent and accurate price data)**

We're going to be buying two to three separate parts every two weeks, until I have it all, so this might take a month or so to do. I'll be buying the core parts first probably (CPU, GPU, Case, Mobo within two weeks).


* **What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? ""Everything"" is not specific enough. Just the tower? Operating System? Keyboard, mouse, monitor, speakers/headset, WiFi adapter, etc?**

Tower and the innards, OS, and I have the rest.

USA, no.

* **If reusing any parts, what parts will you be reusing? Please be especially specific about the power supply. List make and model. If you have a monitor, list the size/resolution.**

Keyboard, Mouse. I'll probably be stuck with this monitor for a while longer, it's a HPvs19e flat screen (1280x1024). It's old, and I'd like to get a new one soon (preferably something around 1920x1080, I have no clue what that is in inches,) but that's for a later date, I don't have the cash atm to buy it all in one sweep.


* **Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line?**

Yeah, as games and stuff get better, probably down the line. Can I take off the old stock fan after months of use and install water cooling? Or will the thermal paste be stuck there?


* **If there's any specific features you want/need from the rig, please list them. Examples might include rear and/or front-panel USB 3.0, a RAID setup, etc.**

I'll need some USB's on the front for flash drives/headset charging/other stuff. More USB's on the back for keyboard/monitor/mouse/mic. (I like USB's. :))


* **Do you already have a legit and reusable/transferable OS key/license? If yes, what OS? Is it 32bit or 64bit?**

Nope.

*I really want to get the haswell line of Intel CPUs and the GTX 770, hopefully that will fit in my build.* If it won't fit, I'll stick with the Haswell, stick with a 660/70, and upgrade the GPU later down the road with whatever comes after the GTX 700 series. I also want to stay away from AMD, unless someone can really persuade me to go AMD instead on Intel/Nvidia for CPU/GPU. I've had bad experiences with AMD.

Gaming mostly. Looking to play Crysis, Skyrim, Last of Us, etc. and next gen games at full settings. Will most likely be multi-tasking with music/video streaming and watching. 

* Price?

$1200~1500

I'd be willing to go to 1500 for the right rig, but the closer (or lower) to $1200 the better.

* Building/Buying?

Asap

* What's needed?

Tower (mid), keyboard, monitors (2 of decent size would be good), wifi adapter (if not included), computer innards, aftermarket cooling system for a bit of overclocking, speakers/sub (though totally optional).

* Buying in?

The US. I'm not near a Microcenter, but Best Buy will likely price match. I got them to do so for an i7 processor, even though the nearest Microcenter is 700 miles away. =)


* Parts reusing / Already owned?

Only my Death Adder Mouse and Vaas headphones.

I also have already purchased an i7-3770k processor for $230, a 3TB Seagate Barracuda 7200 drive for $125, OEM Windows 7 for $90, and a SAPPHIRE Radeon HD 7970 GPU for $300. 

* Overclocking?

Yes, though I don't know much about doing it, so probably down the line. 

* Features included?

The ability to easily upgrade it in the future. I want this rig to last a while, and be simple and inexpensive to upgrade in a few years. I'd also like 16 gigs of ram and a good graphics card (as needed). 

* Case?

Preferably Mid sized case with some nice LEDs. A glass panel on the side could be nice if the internal lighting is good enough. I like blue and green lights. Black case preferred.

* OS? 

See above.

Gaming, primarily next-gen pc ports so it would be ideal if whatever I buy could handle xbone and PS4 games over the next few years. They don't need to be at ultra settings, they can be at medium. I just want to get into PC gaming. Aside from that, I'll be using it for schoolwork in college. Things like Microsoft Word or Powerpoint, etc. 
&gt;What is your maximum preferred budget before rebates/shipping/taxes? 
My maximum budget at the moment is $1150 including the monitor, keyboard, and mouse, as well as the case and all of the parts. I know that's not an awful lot. :( 
&gt;When do you plan on building/buying the PC? (note: if you're planning on buying more than 2 weeks from now, it's very much recommended you wait and come back then, to ensure you get the most recent and accurate price data)

As soon as I get a good parts list hammered together, I should begin snatching them up and putting it together. 

&gt;What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? ""Everything"" is not specific enough. Tower, Operating System, peripherals like the keyboard, mouse, and monitor(s), wifi adapter, speakers/headphones, etc. are all relevant.

I need a keyboard, mouse, a monitor, a case, and an OS as well as all the parts required to allow the thing to run. The peripherals and the monitor can be relatively inexpensive though I would prefer the monitor be 1080p. 
&gt;Which country will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in the US, are you near a Microcenter store?

I'm in Michigan and I live near a Microcenter so that shouldn't be an issue.
&gt;If reusing any parts, what parts will you be reusing? Please be especially specific about the power supply. List make and model. If you have a monitor, list the size/resolution.

This is actually my first build so I have nothing, unfortunately. :(
&gt;Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?

I suppose I'll be overclocking both the CPU and the GPU so I can really make them sing. I shan't be doing it too heavily though as I want to preserve their lives.

&gt;If there's any specific features you want/need from the rig, please list them. Examples might include rear and/or front-panel USB 3.0, a RAID setup, etc.

A USB port would be nice, as would an optical drive, but they're not requirements. 


&gt;Do you have any specific case/tower preferences such as a window or LEDs, or do you have a preference for low-noise components?
I'd prefer less noise, but I have no real preferences.

&gt;Do you already have a legit and reusable/transferable OS key/license? If yes, what OS?

I believe I have one for Windows 7, but I'd prefer to give 8 a try.

My housemate needs to stream games for her job. This post on the frontpage really interested me:

http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/1fogkv/build_complete_the_little_box_that_could_my_first/

It's a small-form factor device that gets a lot for a little. This is the sort of thing that would be perfect: Good results, not too expensive, and small enough to hide away when not in use. However, the primary function of our PC is that it needs to be able to stream: it needs to be able to output 1080p footage at a consistent rate. 

Would that guy's build need any modification? Is this possible? I'm not sure what sort of resources streaming uses, but I imagine it hurts the CPU to generate that video output? What's the cheapest, smallest method we can use to stream games in moderate-to-high quality?

tl:dr:

* Need to be as cheap as possible

* Needs to be able to stream games at 1080p

* Needs to be as small as possible

Congrats to eagleslanding and sierpinski13.  I wound up deviating quite a bit, but really liked the 840 pro both of them suggested, the 7950 from eagleslanding, and the power supply discussion on sierpinski13 was very informative.  Same can be said for Xeon debate.  I probably should have gone Xeon and saved $100 but i7-3770k was just too tempting.

&gt;What will you be doing with this PC? Gaming? Photoshop? Web browsing? etc. If you need a Workstation, be specific on the programs you'll be using.

The main use for this PC is web development.  I run linux and right now my main programs I use are Gedit (text editor), VirtualBox + 3 virtuals for XP, 7, and 8 testing and photoshop, chrome, firefox, and many console windows.

I also plan on purchasing a 30"" 2560x1600 monitor.  I've been leaning towards this one offered by [monoprice](http://www.monoprice.com/products/product.asp?c_id=113&amp;cp_id=11307&amp;cs_id=1130703&amp;p_id=10234&amp;seq=1&amp;format=2), but I'm open to suggestions on that as well.

&gt;What is your maximum preferred budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?

With monitor and keyboard, I'm hoping for $1700 - 2k.  That's budgeting $800 for monitor, $100 for a good keyboard and the rest for the main desktop.  Right now I'm running a q6600 from 4 or 5 years ago so I'm not much of an enthusiast and plan on keeping the rig for hopefully a similar time frame.

Monitor, Case, SSD, Memory, graphics card, CPU, power supply, keyboard (cherry MX, thinking brown but can be persuaded elsewhere too)

&gt;Which country will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in the US, are you near a Microcenter store?
In US, but not near a microcenter.

&gt;If reusing any parts, what parts will you be reusing? Please be especially specific about the power supply. List make and model. If you have a monitor, list the size/resolution.
I want to use a 30"" IPS monitor listed above.  All other items need purchased.  I could probably re-use my power supply since it's fairly new, but I don't want to mess with it.

&gt;Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line?
If it can be done ""easily"" sure, but it's not a priority.  I've tried overclocking a few things myself and it has always ended with CMOS resets so I don't want an epic hassle.

&gt;If there's any specific features you want/need from the rig, please list them. Examples might include rear and/or front-panel USB 3.0, a RAID setup, etc.
I want to have USB 3.0 ports accessible from the front of the machine.  Also, I store most of my data on another local server, so really just need the SSD with a decent amount of space (128gb minimum I think)

&gt;Do you already have a legit and reusable/transferable OS key/license? If yes, what OS? Is it 32bit or 64bit?
Ubuntu, I run 32bit right now, but might give 64bit a go with a new rig.

&gt;Extra info or specifics:
I don't ""plan"" on gaming on this machine...but I'm a bit concerned that an awesome rig and display may make this a tempting proposition.

Here's some ramblings on my thoughts on this overall:

I've been looking at things a bit and the i5-3570k looks like a pretty nice processor.  Seems like i7 is overkill for most folks.  i5 might even be overkill for what I want to do, but I feel like i3 might be limiting down the road if I do get board and want to dual boot into Windows so I can give PC gaming a shot.

I really want to be able to have as many things open as I want -- I have probably 50+ tabs open at any one time across a few instances of chrome (I know it's ridiculous) and I've kind of gotten irritated by how slow the virtuals run (I think they're memory bound as I only have 8gb right now so each is limited to 1 to 2gb right now), so splurging on the 32gb of ram seems like something that might make sense for me.  

There are a couple variants of the monitor I'm looking at, one only has dual link dvi (and is $100 less) the other offers display port and hdmi as well.  I'm not sure how important that is overall.  I'm also a little worried about linux compatibility with that monster pixel count.  It sounds like ATI might be the way to go, but not really sure.

I'm also open to suggestions on the monitor as well.  Monoprice is usually my first choice for anything they sell, but if you have a better value (not necessarily price) I'm all ears.  Amazon has a dell for $1,000 with a 3 year warranty that I'm considering as well.

I also am sort of justifying this purchase (specifically SSD) as I want to be able to suspend this thing and turn it off when it's not in use.  My power bills are obnoxious between my desktop and old oven/server AMD Phenom X4 so I want to be able to suspend and turn back on immediately.

On the keyboard I've been looking at the Cherry mx brown ones.  Again, primary concern on this thing is web development, but I'd love to hear what folks say about the various colors.  I think Brown or Blue is what you want to do if you type a lot (like I do) from what I've read.

One other point.  This server will live in a closet about 10 feet from me.  I plan on wiring the dvi/displayport/hdmi through the crawlspace, but I'm not sure what to do to get sound and possibly keyboard (seems like a lot of the nice keyboards aren't wireless).

Basically it's just coming up on 5 years of no upgrades and this is my bread and butter so I want to be more productive and save some energy (via quicker bootup / suspend).  

I spend my whole day on a computer and have built my last few, but I feel like as I get older, there's a ""too old for this"" factor that has crept in so I'm willing to pay for some expertise.

The author of the build I choose will receive a $20 amazon card.

2 other points when considering total cost:
I have a shoprunner membership, so Newegg shipping is free.
I have a prime membership so Amazon (or fulfilled) shipping is free.
I live by a best buy, but they haven't been price competive in years, so I can't see that being a factor.

-No overclocking (Might do so down the road? Unsure, post some suggestions but siding with reliability)

-8GB Ram should be fine; 1 TB Storage

-No Microcenter close enough

-One monitor

-Able to play modern games on high settings

-Able to run mods/texture packs with ease

-Able to handle upgrades down the road to keep up with newer games

I need something that will last for moderate server needs, it'll be on 24/7.

I'm thinking of a mini ITX build, because I've already got a hunking desktop by the desk. I love the orange BitFenix Prodigy tower and it'd look amazing sitting on my desk on the side.

As far as the monitor and other peripherals go, I'm gonna use some old parts I got lying around, so don't worry about that. I'm looking at a ~$750 budget, if you can keep it to ~$500 though that'd be awesome. But I'd still like quality &gt; price, so when there's an advantage to go fancier I'll be cool closer to the $750.

I've pretty much decided on the orange BitFenix Prodigy (unless you guys are against it, in which case I'll take your advice) but pretty much nothing else. Go nuts.

**EDIT:** Thanks for everyone's response! I don't have to host a Minecraft server with this, I really just wanted a dedicated and multipurpose server machine to do whatever I want now and in the future. Minecraft would've been ideal, but since I only get like ~1 Mbit/s upload I can use it for a home fileserver or an HTPC or a download machine too. I've done some digging and seems like that probably all I could do without getting a 3-digit bill per month for a business internet plan. I'm a programmer too so a build server would probably also be nice. Having said that, it's great you gave me so many suggestions!

It's main use will be programming, emulating and gaming. I use Virtual Machines daily, in conjunction with Visual Studio, Eclipse, DB tools and other programming stuff. I may even start developing for 3D stuff in my spare time, which I didn't have the chance yet. I also want the building to be capable of supporting several monitors. I would like 3+ for a nice panorama view in games like Skyrim or Minecraft but only if it doesn't over-blow the budget. If not I'd just get 2 and buy Oculus Rift with the money or something. About my played games I don't do the latest ones, I'd rather play a couple years old game or emulate or maybe an indie with lots of filters, high res texturepacks and resolution downsampling to make it look gorgeous, so muscle is required but in a different way.

My idea is to get a Intel CPU, Nvidia GPU (one or several), one fast SSD, one storage HD, fast RAM, enough PSU to support future enhancements and a case, coolers and mobo that fits the beast. 21""-24"" gaming monitors in whatever number. In the whole build noise is not an issue because I'm with earphones all the time, but temperature maybe is. Budget tops at 2000€ including the monitors.

Also, despite not including it on the budget I would like recommendations on a mouse, mechanical keyboard, a 3D headphone with microphone and some cheap speakers to use when people come watch a movie.

I'm looking to get a windows desktop that can run the Sims 3 and all the expansion packs smoothly. I'd also want to play Minecraft and games like Portal (and Skyrim if it could handle it). I also like online games like Maplestory (don't judge me lol).

However I do have a small budget, was hoping to get set up for £250 or less. Would that be completely impossible? I am very open to getting a refurbished desktop if a build would be too expensive/too difficult for me (serious newbie here). 

I am a complete newbie at understanding computer specs and parts. What are the main important things to look for, for good game performance - processor, RAM and graphics card? Would really appreciate any help in picking out either a good refurbished model, or a build, or just any suggestion in what to look out for.

I'm in the US.

I'd like to have a ton of monitors (3-6?) as I do project management freelance and having numerous windows open and in front of me is helpful, and 'eyefinity' seems like it will do the trick within budget, and I'm not really in need of super high res.  I use a 1080, 32"" TV as my main monitor and I'm fine with it.

I'm thinking I can keep my case, but does everything else need to go?  Can I just upgrade my video card, or what are your thoughts?  

Let's put the budget at $500 and see what people think.

MoBo: Gigabyte EP45-UD3R 
Proc: 2.40 gigahertz Intel Core2 Quad
Video: ATI Radeon HD 4600
RAM: 4 Slots of 2GB each (8GB)

I've also play some Portal 2, Diablo 3, and occasionally multi-box some old MMOs (Everquest and Lord of the Rings Online) with friends.  Skyrim was essentially unplayable for me so I would like to enjoy that on high settings, and my brother wants me to try Planetside 2 with him.

I think the i3 would be sufficient for my use, however I live near enough to a Microcenter, and picking up the i5-3570k ($10 less than the 3470)+ motherboard with $40 off seems like quite a good deal.  If I go this route, which motherboard from their selection would be best?

 - An awesome processor, I'm running a dual 2.2 Ghz now and it's frustratingly slow 
- reduced noise level, I don't want to be playing on a PC that's louder than the game I'm playing 
- decent to high level graphics, I have an AMD Radeon HD 6570 that I got I few months back until I had enough saved up for an actual build and I'm not too sure if I have to entirely replace this video card.

I'd want enough space on an SSD to boot windows, my editing programs, and maybe my current project or two. I will not need any peripherals or DVD drives as I can salvage them from my old desktop.

UPDATE: I want to get i7 instead of AMD processor. I'm flexible between 2x2TB or 1x3TB hard drive. I also need at the very least, 16gb of ram as well. I will not be overclocking.

I was looking at this setup, but I'm not sure if this will work best with my needs. 

Is 3gb graphics card too overkill for my needs?

I would be planning on this system to be my primary workstation for the next 3-4 years.

I have been on the fence about going ahead with this, but given the time of year and the possibility of getting a few of the parts at a discount, I figure now is the time to go ahead with it.

I'm looking at a budget of $2000, as I've been saving up for quite awhile for this.

I'll require all the peripherals except for a mouse (I have a Naga).  Right now, I use my MacBook Pro for all of my computer needs, and once I've bought this new rig I plan on basically just using the laptop for my classes and general internet shenanigans.

I should also add that I'm a pretty huge noob when it comes to computer hardware, and I'd like to have a general idea of what all this stuff does/why it's important.  If you could give a brief description of this stuff or point me in the direction of something that can, I'd appreciate it.

So that's it.  Sorry this post is pretty wordy, I wanted to make sure I gave you guys all the info you'll need.

A good friend of mine needs to get her autistic son a new computer. He's pretty high functioning.  He sent me a list of what he uses his computer for. He's a gamer for certain. I would put him in the 7-8 out if 10 range based on the games he listed.  From MineCraft to the very high end, Steam, he seems to have a handle on it all. 

Though he struggles with performance and space as he's currently doing all this on an older laptop. I can't imagine how happy he will be to see a game in hi-res with all features on at 28-30 inches.  His attention to detail tells me these changes won't go unnoticed. 

But he also plays with CAD apps, digitizers, and other graphics stuff. I'm not in a position right now to custom build him a PC, after hearing a bit more, I'm not sure it's the best idea. I would forever be bound to keeping the computer working. He doesn't seem to currently have any interest in the internals of a computer. 

This may change as he gets older, but at 13-14 years old, it's just not his deal. I can't see him tuning ram and CPU speeds and fiddling with drivers and the like. I'll be moving soon too. 

His Mom promised him a new computer and its been a while so he is anxious to get one. 

I don't know what to recommend. Just send her to Alienware and configure up an Aurora or I did a google search for 2012 reviews of gaming pc's which shows rather impressive specs on their first pick.

Full disclosure: I'm a Mac user but build out a lot of servers. This would actually be my first ""Desktop"" build of this nature. Though I've built plenty of Desktop servers all the way up to 16U RAID monsters. 

If put in a position where you couldn't build your own kit, but just had to buy a computer that you wanted to game with. With 1500.00 or so being the budget, and adding a few hundred more for a display ( I would probably go with a Dell display ) what would you do?

I managed to keep her away from Best Buy, but now we need to make an order. Support is important if something is bad or DOA. I don't want to look bad recommending a choice and support totally screwing them. 

Any suggestions are greatly appreciated. I will update this post with what decision is made.

Notes: 

Good, fast, long-range wireless peripherals are important.

I might use a second monitor (which I already have) on a nearby endtable to do housekeeping on the computer, rather than do that from the couch. To that end, making sure the graphics card(s) can handle that is important.

I might make the TV decision separately, but feel free to make suggestions if there's one that would work better than another.

I'll be using it primarily for gaming and web browsing.  I'd like to run Skyrim on as high of settings as my budget allows for.  Beyond that, I play a lot of Civilization V, Kerbal Space Program, Total War, and Sims games.

&gt;What is your maximum preferred budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?

I'm looking to spend around $450.  The closer to that number, the better, though I would consider spending 25-50 dollars extra if it makes a big enough difference.

&gt;When do you plan on building/buying the PC?

This will be within the next week.

I'll need the standard selection of parts for it, including CPU, motherboard, graphics, RAM, a hard drive, power supply, and case.  I have peripherals already.

Gaming. He's given up on the hussle of consoles and thanks to some outside persuasion (eheheh...), is willing to make the switch! He also does some voice recording and video editing for school.
&gt;What is your maximum preferred budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?

He's willing to max out at around $2,600. Money isn't too much of an issue, so a little bit above that is fine. He wants to outdo and shame my old budget build as much as possible and settled on this number because [Wynaut](http://www.deviantart.com/art/Wynaut-351688122). He's an ass, I know.

He's starting from scratch save the desk. Entails shall include the tower, mouse and keyboard, mouse mat, speakers, headphones, microphone, and three monitors.

(EDIT: If allocating money elsewhere would be smarter, he's willing to break it down to two monitors) If we could get some green cathodes/LED's, that'd be crazy awesome.

Noise is not a problem. Though, he has stated numerous times that a side window to view the goodies will be in order. It'll make the whole LED/cathode option actually viable anyways.

First off, thanks a lot for taking the time to read this! It can be a confusing thing getting a new PC and I really appreciate the assistance. 

I'll be using this computer primarily for Games and some Media work. Games-wise, I play things like Tribes Ascend, Skyrim, Fallout, Kerbil Space Program, and tons of indie games. 

Media-wise, I usually use Gimp for photo editing, concept art, map making, etc. I'm not sure if it's possible to get something capable of running Unity, but that would be awesome too.

&gt;What is your maximum preferred budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?

After taxes, $1000 firm. So I guess around $800 before taxes.

&gt;When do you plan on building/buying the PC? (note: if you're planning on buying more than 2 weeks from now, it's very much recommended you wait and come back then, to ensure you get the most recent and accurate price data)

As soon as possible!

I need the whole she-bang, (whole tower, mouse, keyboard, sound system) aside from a monitor, which I'll be using from my old PC that kicked the bucket.

&gt;Which country will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in the US, are you near a Microcenter store?

I am in Canada! I live just a few blocks from an NCIX.

&gt;If reusing any parts, what parts will you be reusing? Please be especially specific about the power supply. List make and model. If you have a monitor, list the size/resolution.

The monitor is a Samsung 23"" 550. 1920x1080 resolution, HDMI and VGA in.

No thanks!

Nothing in particular, though the two monitors I have ready for it are only VGA and HDMI in... but I can just pick up a DVI to VGA converter if need be.

Gaming with Steam/LoL and *possibly* some streaming later on. Would like to run on close to highest settings. Coming from a mid-2009 MBP which I want to use solely for school/work. I might put some higher level, windows exclusive programs on this PC, which may include Matlab, Aspen, and whatever else I can get my hands on.

I'd like to spend no more than $600 on this guy, but if I **need** to spend a little bit more I will.

&gt;What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? ""Everything"" is not specific enough. Tower, Operating System, peripherals like the keyboard, mouse, and monitor(s), wifi adapter, speakers/headphones, etc. are all relevant.

I have a mouse, speakers, a TV which I will use as a monitor (no other use).

USA. Near Orange County Microstore.

College student. I will most likely still use my laptop for when I'm at home or go to a cyber cafe, so portability is not a problem. Like I stated earlier, I am leaving in 2 weeks, so whether I should build here and ship or ship the parts to my apartment is undecided as of now

&gt;Do you already have a legit and reusable/transferable OS key/license? If yes, what OS?

No, but I believe my school has free OS for current students.  If not that is something I can get easily, would like Windows 7.

Primarily will be used for gaming, but will also be used for recording, pixel art stuff, coding, and light editing. Examples of Software I will be using include: **Sony Vegas Pro 10/11 | Adobe After Effects | Cinema 4d | Fraps | Guitar Pro 5 | Audacity | GIMP/Photoshop etc.** 

Examples of Games I would like to play at a Medium range comfortably include: **Dragon Age: Ultimate | Saints Row 2 | Fallout NV |CS:GO | Left4Dead2 | CoD: WaW | Hitman Blood Money** I would also like to run some newer games decently. Also, It would be a dream come true if I could run the Dolphin Emulator and games nicely but not required..

* What is my maximum preferred budget?

At the moment I can only afford to dish out 500$, however, I hope to add upgrades in the future.

* When do you plan on buying/building the PC

It's not a very good answer, but as soon as possible. The laptop that I'm using is starting to fail on me. Once I have a parts list to go off of, I can start to get everything together.

* What exactly do you need included in the budget?

I need the tower, an OS, a moderately priced wired keyboard and wired mouse, a WiFi adapter, and anything else that is essential. Unfortunately I'm new at this and don't know what all I will need.

* Which country will you be purchasing the parts in?

I am in Utah, US. So I am not near a microcenter.

I have a 39"" Magnavox HDTV, I do not know it's specs, but it is capable of 1920 x 1080 I think. 

* Will you be overclocking? Are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?

I'm interested in overclocking if it boosts performance. However I will have to research into it to make sure I know what I'm doing. As for CPU and GPU, I'm at a loss. :(

* Are there any specific features you want/need from the rig?

4 Slots total of USB would be really appreciated, 2/3 front and 1 back. or whatever can be managed. I'm not too picky. Aestethics wise I'd really like a Black and Purple vibe going. Just the most bang for my buck really.

**&gt;Do you have any specific case/tower preferences such as a window or LEDs, or do you have a preference for low-noise components?**

Not really. Pretty basic budget build. Price is the biggest factor.

No preference.

No. 

I will need windows 7 or 8. I'm open to advice.

95% gaming, mixed with web-browsing, comic-reading, and occasionally acquiring long-run television series via BitTorrent. 

I want to play TW: Rome 2 on ""holy SHIT"" settings, if possible at this budget. Skyrim + Fallout: New Vegas on high/ultra with graphical mods would be awesome. If the PC port of GTA V comes out good, I'd love to play that on high settings with mods. I'd like to revisit Far Cry 3 and Tomb Raider (2013) on the highest settings possible (edit: at this budget)--ditto Bioshock Infinite.

**What is your maximum preferred budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?**

$1,100 US 

**When do you plan on building/buying the PC?**

Within 2 weeks

**What, exactly, do you need included in the budget?**

I have a monitor, keyboard, mouse, and speakers/headphones. 

I *might* have a 240GB SSD with a Windows 8 license (more on that below)

I need the tower and everything inside it. Tower will live about 5 feet from my FiOS modem, so I'm thinking a hard-wired internet connection will suffice (but maybe maintain the option to add a WiFi adaptor down the line, in case my living situation changes). 

**Which country will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in the US, are you near a Microcenter store?**

US, and I can get to a Microcenter pretty easily.

**If reusing any parts, what parts will you be reusing? Please be especially specific about the power supply. List make and model. If you have a monitor, list the size/resolution.**

A) [this 24"" 1920x1080 monitor](http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/searchtools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=5220691&amp;SRCCODE=WEBLET101SATSFY&amp;cm_mmc=Email-_-WebletMain-_-WEBLET101SATSFY-_-Satisfy). I have an HDMI-to-DVI cable (in other words, the lack of HDMI-in on this monitor isn't a problem. I don't need native DVI-output or anything. Just HDMI.)

B) [this 240GB SSD] (http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820171568&amp;Tpk=SanDisk%20Extreme%20SDSSDX-240G-G25&amp;IsVirtualParent=1). This is currently the only drive in my laptop (I have Win8 installed on it). Do you think I, a relative n00b, could take this drive out of my laptop, install it in this new build, and then return the original HDD to that laptop without f*%#ing up everything? If so, then I can reuse the SSD in this new build.

**Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?**

No.
 
**If there's any specific features you want/need from the rig, please list them. Examples might include rear and/or front-panel USB 3.0, a RAID setup, etc.**

Must have HDMI-out. Plan to output games to a 32"" 720p LCD HDTV.

**Edit:** just thought of optical drives--I don't need one! I have an external CD/RW drive I can hook up in a pinch. 

**Do you have any specific case/tower preferences such as a window or LEDs, or do you have a preference for low-noise components?**

I would prefer a case with easy access for cleaning--I have a cat, and the tower will be close to the floor, so I expect a lot of fur to get sucked into the intakes. Other than that, small and quiet would be nice, but I could make sacrifices in those areas for beefier performance.

I don't want any glowing LEDs or ornamental windows--a minimal case would be best. Basically, think of an Alienware tower, then picture the total opposite. (If case windows serve a functional/practical purpose other than pure aesthetics, let me know--I could totally be missing something obvious there.)

**Do you already have a legit and reusable/transferable OS key/license? If yes, what OS?**

Honestly, I'm not quite sure! I bought and used an official Windows 8 upgrade license from Microsoft, but have no idea how transferable that is to a new build. [Is this helpful in any way](http://i.imgur.com/Ox1cFrP.png)? 

Also, if I reuse the SSD, would the copy of Win8 installed on that drive work in the new build, or would I need to wipe the SSD before installing in a new build? In other words, would an SSD with Win8 that was installed on a different system/MoBo still work if plopped into a new build?

    Tower - Enamored with the Fractal Design series, but if a roadblock to better performance, toss it.
    Ignore speakers/headphones.
    Have Windows 7 already.
    Power Supply.
    CPU - Not interested in minimal performance gains, so go with a lower model if this is the case.
    GPU - 1080p gaming at highest frame rates possible on max settings. Single card only at this stage with potential for dual cards if available; otherwise, not necessary.
    Motherboard - Expandable, cool and reliable. I was recommended Gigabit but not necessary.
    Memory - standard DDR3.
    Additional fans - Only if required.
    Hard drives - Preferably an SSD for OS/games, and a regular for storage.

First, I will like to see other Redditors comment on the build so ill probably make a ""Build Ready"" post on r/buildapc. Once I get enough opinion's on it I will buy all the parts. Shouldn't take longer than a week.

&gt;What, exactly, do you need included in the budget?
Tower/Case, CPU, GPU, wiring, power supply, 3 high quality monitors, SSD, Hardrives, maybe a water cooling system? It sounds cool but idk if its necessary, etc... I dont need speakers tho.

I live in the US. I live about an hour away from a Microcenter store, so if necessary for a better deal, I will drive there.

I wont be reusing anything. I want a fresh new start to a kick-ass PC.

I probably will but not now. I don't want to harm the CPU too much but I would like to extend the power of the CPU as it becomes obsolete over the years. I will overclock to improve the FPS of a certain game, or the speed in which a program runs.

&gt;If there's any specific features you want/need from the rig, please list them. 
I need it to support 3 monitors in an Eyefinity form. Thats pretty much it, I just don't want it to lack anything necessary for my major Computer Science.

&gt;Do you have any specific case/tower preferences such as a window or LEDs, or do you have a preference for low-noise components?
I really want the case/tower to be special and unique. I want it to be a solid build that really stands out. I would also like to be able to see the inside at least a little bit like through a window on the case, but its not necessary. Blue LED's for sure. Noise should be just about medium. 

&gt;Do you already have a legit and reusable/transferable OS key/license? If yes, what OS?
I have every OS.

&gt;Extra info or specifics:
I would like a cool keyboard that changes color. Also make sure the monitors are mountable and of good quality. I've heard IPS monitors are great.
I would like to run both an SSD and a hard drive(2-3TB) because I've heard its a good combo. Also I'll probably be running plenty of mods so make sure there is enough RAM. I really want this computer to be perfect, fast, and ""Future Proof"".

Within the next two weeks

&gt;What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? ""Everything"" is not specific enough. Tower, Operating System, peripherals like the keyboard, mouse, and monitor(s), wifi adapter, speakers/headphones, etc. are all relevant.

Case, Keyboard, Mouse, Monitor, Speakers.

&gt;Which country will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in the US, are you near a Microcenter store?

USA, not near a Microcenter

&gt;If reusing any parts, what parts will you be reusing? Please be especially specific about the power supply. List make and model. If you have a monitor, list the size/resolution.

Building from nothing

&gt;Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?

Possible in the future, I'm considering overclocking the CPU but unsure of how to go about the process.

&gt;If there's any specific features you want/need from the rig, please list them. Examples might include rear and/or front-panel USB 3.0, a RAID setup, etc.

No preference

I prefer AMD CPUs, but he has no preference.

&gt;**What will you be doing with this PC? Gaming? Photoshop? Web browsing? etc. If you need a Workstation, be specific on the programs you'll be using. Try to list as many games/applications that you'll be using as you can, as well as your performance goals for those programs.**

Gaming mostly. Games like League of Legends, Starcraft Broodwar, Starcraft 2 HoTs, Company of Heroes, maybe Battlefield 4 when it comes out. He wants to be able to play games on high with a decent framerate. He also draws a lot so Photoshop is a big one. Then the regular, Netflix, Youtube, Reddit.

&gt;**What is your maximum preferred budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?**

$800-1,000. He said he has a lot more that he could spend on it, but he would much rather just keep that in the bank. He just wants the modernize. His computer is going on 7 years old.

&gt;**When do you plan on building/buying the PC? (note: if you're planning on buying more than 2 weeks from now, it's very much recommended you wait and come back then, to ensure you get the most recent and accurate price data)**

I'm pretty sure he wants to start buying parts in the next couple days.

&gt;**What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? ""Everything"" is not specific enough. Tower, Operating System, peripherals like the keyboard, mouse, and monitor(s), wifi adapter, speakers/headphones, etc. are all relevant.**

Tower, Keyboard (mechanical Brown) and Mouse, headphones, and 1-2 monitors he said he would be fine with 1 but if there is a good deal for 2 he'd be down.

&gt;**Which country will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in the US, are you near a Microcenter store?**

US. Washington to be specific, so no Microcenter.

&gt;**If reusing any parts, what parts will you be reusing? Please be especially specific about the power supply. List make and model. If you have a monitor, list the size/resolution.**

He might be reusing one of his monitors if we can't find a good deal on 2 new monitors. I don't know the resolution of it, but it's not widescreen. It's also a pretty old monitor.

&gt;**Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?**

I don't think he has any desire to overclock, but I wanted to include a [Cooler Master Hyper 212 Evo](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16835103099) to replace whatever stock fan comes with the CPU he orders.

&gt;**If there's any specific features you want/need from the rig, please list them. Examples might include rear and/or front-panel USB 3.0, a RAID setup, etc.**

USB 3.0 is always nice, but he wont be doing any RAID or really anything special with it.

&gt;**Do you have any specific case/tower preferences such as a window or LEDs, or do you have a preference for low-noise components?**

The [Corsair Carbide Series 200R Black Steel](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811139018&amp;Tpk=corsair%20200r&amp;IsVirtualParent=1) is actually the exact case he wants, because it's a cheaper nice case.

&gt;**Do you already have a legit and reusable/transferable OS key/license? If yes, what OS?**

He has a legit reusable copy of Windows 7.

&gt;**Extra info or specifics:**

Nothing other than to say thanks for the help in advance. In thinking about it, if there was a big difference in performance in not including the Keyboard and Mouse in the total price I'm sure he would be fine with buying them at a later date. He already has a set, they are just pretty old.

* My preference for a case would be solid black exterior with painted black interior; no side window. My current case is a Cooler Master CM 690 II I like everything about it, other than the front, it's too flashy. If I could chose it would be nothing but a black rectangle. I've been taken by Cooler Master cases in the past. When it comes down to it, performance and airflow take priority, even if it's as loud as a jet.

Germany

&gt;If reusing any parts, what parts will you be reusing? Please be especially specific about the power supply. List make and model. If you have a monitor, list the size/resolution.

I'm using an i3-330 on a ECS H55H-I in a Lian Li at the moment. Other than the two 2TB drives, I'd like to keep this old horse and use it as a fallback machine. 

Two 23° monitors (1920xwhatever) and a 32° fullHD TV.

No! Rather undervolting than ocing.

&gt;If there's any specific features you want/need from the rig, please list them. Examples might include rear and/or front-panel USB 3.0, a RAID setup, etc.

Three monitors at the same time, one via HDMI, two via DVI or vga. That's a must. Fast SSD would be nice, but not completely necessary. Gigabit ethernet should be standard in 2013, no? WLan is not necessary, but nice if it's there. Everything else is optional.

&gt;Do you have any specific case/tower preferences such as a window or LEDs, or do you have a preference for low-noise components?

Silence would be nice. Watercooling would be overshooting it, but as quiet as possible is a goal. Ties in with another thing that would be nice, which is a small electricity bill. Low power consumption and passive cooling is definitely more important than five additional fps in a game I'm not playing anyway... 

No LEDs or something like that necessary. I'd rather prefer it if there were no lights at all. 

&gt;Do you already have a legit and reusable/transferable OS key/license? If yes, what OS?

... Linux. Probably Fedora, but perhaps I'll give Mint a spin.


Main thing I'm worrying about is the three monitors under linux. I'd definitely prefer an Haswell setup without dedicated GPU, but I haven't found anything about multi-monitor setups. My old i3-330 has two DVI and a hdmi jack, but I can't use all three monitors at the same time, at least not using their natives resolutions. 

I've heard many good things about the Haswell, given my goals, but I'm not sure whether a new AMD wouldn't be a cheaper alternative.

I'd like to have it built by the end of the summer before college starts, but am willing to buy parts at different times (by august)

I need a case, CPU, GPU, RAM, HDD(or SSD, or SSD/HDD combo), MB, CPU Cooler(maybe?), PSU, OS, and possibly a wireless card.

I would like to overclock if it means I can get better performance for a lower price point, but only if it can be done 'safely'

I am planning to play world of Warcraft, diabolo3, star craft 2 on max settings. Also It would be nice to do some autoCAD drawings for work but not really a must.

$500 dollars

&gt;When do you plan on building/buying the PC?

ASAP. If its after 2 weeks I can add $100 dollars to the budget but if the machine runs wow on max settings I won't do that.

&gt;What, exactly, do you need included in the budget?

All the components inside the tower. I have an old tower (350W power supply), a monitor, mouse keyboard, and a legit windows 7 cd

&gt;Which country will you be purchasing the parts in? 

Canada. More specific Toronto

&gt;If reusing any parts, what parts will you be reusing? 

My friend gave me a cool master tower with a 350W supply. i have a feeling it's too weak. I also have a monitor ( 21 inches 1920x1080)

&gt;Will you be overclocking?

I wouldn't mind overclocking further down the road. When the pc starts feeling slow. I would prefer to keep it with stock coolers and then add some nice coolers in a few years ( should be fun). So yes overclockable parts are a plus. Both CPU and GPU. 

&gt;If there's any specific features you want/need?

N/a

&gt;Do you have any specific case/tower preferences such as a window or LEDs, or do you have a preference for low-noise components?

No. I'm going to be using headphones and I don't care about power usage. I'm renting so if a CPU is really inefficient and loud but powerful or cheaper go for that.

&gt;Do you already have a legit and reusable/transferable OS key/license? If yes, what OS?

Windows 7 64 bit.

Also unless there's a really great deal online ( more than $40 difference) then I will just go to Canada computers and pick everything up at once. I already checked all of my local retailers. Prices are very similar. Guys recommend me parts for better performance in the aproximate $500 budget. One stop shopping is amazing.

Microcenter store? I do not thing so I live on The Big Island (Hawaii USA).

6) If reusing any parts, what parts will you be reusing? Please be especially specific about the power supply. List make and model. If you have a monitor, list the size/resolution.

I have a standard USB mouse and keyboard, and the monitor is a Dell AS500 (older but I like it and do not want to have to pay to get a new one out here to Hawaii.)

7) Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?

Nope

8) If there's any specific features you want/need from the rig, please list them. Examples might include rear and/or front-panel USB 3.0, a RAID setup, etc.

Just lots of ram for Minecraft and the option to upgrade graphics in 2-4 months from now. Oh and a standard DVD-rw.

9) Do you have any specific case/tower preferences such as a window or LEDs, or do you have a preference for low-noise components?

The less lights I see the better and not to loud but does not need to be super quite.

10) Do you already have a legit and reusable/transferable OS key/license? If yes, what OS? 

Nope and unless there is some reason not to I really would like to use windows 7 not 8.

11) Extra info or specifics:

I will be using this for full development of video games for PC, consoles, and mobile devices. That includes programming,  developing, testing, rendering, art design and sound. This would include all (free) software involved in those fields. I will also be using it as a basic home computer and as a casual gamer.

800-1200$

The sooner you help me the sooner i will see about buying the parts. Probably within the week.

I will quite literally need everything required for game development. I will be building this from the ground up, so i will require a tower, operating system, etc., and all the peripherals you can think of. Anything and everything for programming, development, testing, rendering, art design, and sound development.

I am reusing nothing.

&gt;Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?

Odds are no. But i would like to keep that a possibility.

&gt;If there's any specific features you want/need from the rig, please list them. Examples might include rear and/or front-panel USB 3.0, a RAID setup, etc.

No specifics other than compatibility with a drawing tablet and the ability to record sound. Also, the ability to develop games (if not obvious) and for use as a home computer.

This will replace both my existing PC and my Xbox as a gaming/media device. The plan is to have two hdmi outputs one to the TV where I can big picture steam/watch movies and the other to my monitor for playing games I prefer the keyboard/mouse config for or browsing the internet. I would like to be able to play Skyrim and Far Cry 3 at high settings and would hope to play the next iteration of the Total War games in a similar range. Outside of gaming all I want to do is watch movies, browse the internet and play music.

My mom's laptop is on the way out, and I offered to build my parents a new machine on the cheap. This is a super basic PC, all they're going to be using it for is the typical old people stuff. Internet, MS office, printing and scanning. No gaming, no photoshop, no video editing, nothing fancy whatsoever.

I told them it would be around $300, so I'd like to stick in that range if possible.

I'm planning on purchasing components this weekend, building the weekend after. We're located in the US, no Microcenter local. Or more accurately, I'm too lazy to haul my ass over to the closest one.

First off, they're going to need an OS. I'd prefer **Windows 7** simply because they're old, and Windows 7 is familiar to what they've been using for the past few years. I'm worried that Windows 8 would be too big of a change for them. I've got an old mouse, monitor, and keyboard as well, so those aren't needed. They will need a **wifi adapter**, since this will be going in their basement and the cable modem and router are upstairs. I've got to check and see if I have some old speakers lying around, if not, they'll probably need some cheap speakers as well.

No parts to reuse- They both own a laptop and a netbook and both of them are old, shitty Dells that are on their way out. The aim here is to build them a cheap PC that will last them a decade or more.

Sorry if I'm getting stupid specific but I don't know exactly how much is supposed to be included but CPU, MB, RAM, GPU (I was thinking something like a 6950, or 7850 but there is no need to be Radeon GTX would work also), , HDD a TB would be good, but 500 wouldn't be bad either (no need for SSD), Case (Micro ITX), Power supply, Optical drive (just the basic read/write drive $20), Monitor (20""-23"", 1080p), Wifi adapter (nothing to expensive), Mouse and mouse pad and keyboard (these 3 don't have to be extremely nice or anything just good quality cheaper stuff).  No need for OS already have windows 7. also stock CPU cooler will do fine. The main thing is micro ITX.

&gt;Which country will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in the US, are you near a Microcenter store?

Northwest Indiana, US.  No microcenter close by :(.

&gt;If reusing any parts, what parts will you be reusing? Please be especially specific about the power supply. List make and model. If you have a monitor, list the size/resolution.

Just windows 7. 

&gt;Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?

Nope

&gt;If there's any specific features you want/need from the rig, please list them. Examples might include rear and/or front-panel USB 3.0, a RAID setup, etc.

Front USB 3.0 would be great. Also a Micro ITX case other than that normal stuff. 
&gt;Do you have any specific case/tower preferences such as a window or LEDs, or do you have a preference for low-noise components?

Like I said before Micro ITX, something that won't be as hot as the sun would be nice. 

&gt;Do you already have a legit and reusable/transferable OS key/license? If yes, what OS?

Yes windows 7 64bit

Strictly gaming. I'm just looking to play games like Team Fortress 2, Counter Strike (1.6, Source and GO), and the dozen or so games in my steam library that won't even play on my Toshiba Satellite (Like Amnesia, Serious Sam HD, and S.T.A.L.K.E.R). After playing on everything low for so long I'd really like to do better. High settings, 60fps, the works. I'm not looking to do anything extreme like Skyrim or Crysis just yet.

&gt;What is your maximum preferred budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?

I'm looking to spend $500-600. But am willing to go at the very highest $700 if really needed.
&gt;When do you plan on building/buying the PC? (note: if you're planning on buying more than 2 weeks from now, it's very much recommended you wait and come back then, to ensure you get the most recent and accurate price data)

I will be buying all my parts this month. (June)
&gt;What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? ""Everything"" is not specific enough. Tower, Operating System, peripherals like the keyboard, mouse, and monitor(s), wifi adapter, speakers/headphones, etc. are all relevant.

I need a case and honestly don't care what it looks like. I do need an Operating System, Keyboard and Mouse.
I'm looking to hook this up to my Insignia LED HDTV so that should take care of monitor and speakers, plus I already have a couple spare HDMI cables laying around. I will also need a wi-fi adapter. I'll probably buy some headphones down the line and would like to know what you guys recommend, but they will be separate from the budget.
&gt;Which country will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in the US, are you near a Microcenter store?

Colorado, USA. There is a Micro Center store not even ten minutes away from me. :)
&gt;If reusing any parts, what parts will you be reusing? Please be especially specific about the power supply. List make and model. If you have a monitor, list the size/resolution.

I plan on using a 46"" 1080p LED HDTV for my monitor.
&gt;Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?

I have no plans to Overclock at all. But I'd like to know if you guys recommend it for my needs now or down the line.
&gt;If there's any specific features you want/need from the rig, please list them. Examples might include rear and/or front-panel USB 3.0, a RAID setup, etc.

An HDMI port to connect to my TV. Nothing else I can think of.
&gt;Do you have any specific case/tower preferences such as a window or LEDs, or do you have a preference for low-noise components?

Again I don't care what it looks like. Make it ugly as hell if you want. If there is room in this budget for LED's then sure, why not?
I would like something that won't turn my room into an oven, and the quieter the better.

Nope.

I got redircted here from this [/r/buildapc post](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/1fx39y/build_help_low_cost_htpc_300) :)  
  
I'd like to build a low cost HTPC for (if possible) less than $300.  
  
This is what I'd like the HTPC to do:  
* Play a variety of different movie formats stored on external HDDs.  
* Be powerful enough to rip DVDs/Blurays (with an external optical drive)  
* Connect through HDMI and be powerful enough to play Full HD content  
* I have an Elgato EyeTV which I'd like to connect to it so I can record shows; therefor an internal HDD would be nice  
* It should be as small as possible - I guess mini-ITX would be great  
* It should be quiet :)  
* As for the OS I was thinking about Windows (7 or 8) as well as XMBC for movies and such... but I already have a copy of these OS' so no need to include in price :)
  
  
I do not want an internal optical drive - since I already have an external drive. It might make the case smaller as well :) 
  

From what I understand is that I only need a mainboard &amp; processor, some RAM, power supply, internal HDD and a case. Does this sound correct?

I have a monitor a Asus Pa238q IPS monitor 1920 x 1080 6ms, which I use for my design work. I also have an old ATI Radeon™ HD 5850 i found in my closet if i can use that as a second graphics card that would be awesome. 

&gt;Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?

Yes and both if possible, anything i can do too boost the performance of the rig since im asking for so much. 

&gt;If there's any specific features you want/need from the rig, please list them. Examples might include rear and/or front-panel USB 3.0, a RAID setup, etc.

Front panel access to USB 3.0 would be nice but if not i can manage

&gt;Do you have any specific case/tower preferences such as a window or LEDs, or do you have a preference for low-noise components?

The quiter the better but other than that no.

I don't but I may be able to get a copy of windows 7 or 8.

&gt;What is your maximum preferred budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?

I would like to stay around the $1000 range. +/- 100 if it means getting a little bit more out of it.

&gt;When do you plan on building/buying the PC? 

I plan or ordering parts over the next week or two.

The main build and the operating system. I have monitors/mouse/headsets/keyboards.

Intense gaming and probably streaming. I want to be playing Star Citizen when it comes out to the highest possible settings without any sorts of lag whatsoever!

&gt;What is your maximum preferred budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?

2300 would be very close to my absolute maximum. If your build goes over that price, you can still post it!

&gt;When do you plan on building/buying the PC? (note: if you're planning on buying more than 2 weeks from now, it's very much recommended you wait and come back then, to ensure you get the most recent and accurate price data)

In very few days/weeks. Depending on several elements, the sooner the better.

&gt;What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? ""Everything"" is not specific enough. Just the tower? Operating System? Keyboard, mouse, monitor, speakers/headset, WiFi adapter, etc?

Only the tower and internal components. I already have the screens, mouse, keyboard, sound system and OS.

Canada.

&gt;If reusing any parts, what parts will you be reusing? Please be especially specific about the power supply. List make and model. If you have a monitor, list the size/resolution.

2x BENQ GL2450 24"" screens 1080p, might want to add a 40"" TV 1080p with that later on.

&gt;Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line?

Maybe, probably would be looking forward to water cooled CPU to get that extra kick!

&gt;If there's any specific features you want/need from the rig, please list them. Examples might include rear and/or front-panel USB 3.0, a RAID setup, etc.

Would like a good motherboard with USB3 and thunderbolt if possible, I might be streaming and looking forward to get the best connections for it. Also looking for a RAID0 SSD build.

&gt;Do you already have a legit and reusable/transferable OS key/license? If yes, what OS? Is it 32bit or 64bit?

I do have Windows 7 Pro 64Bit

&gt;Extra info or specifics:

I want to pick up a 3T HDD at least for storage other than the 2x SSD in RAID0. I don't really care the interior of the machine all that much, so the flashing colors and neons everywhere is completely useless for me. Getting a nice motherboard with a good integrated sound card is a must or getting an external sound card might be needed. 

The computer has to be easily transportable (a case with a handle if possible) for LAN and events that I attend.

If you have any kind of suggestion I would love to hear them and why you propose them, thanks a lot in advance!

I wish for a gaming PC capable of playing: Dota 2, Heroes of Newerth, Left for Dead 2, Civ 5, MineCraft, DayZ and other RPGs (Fallout and Skyrim) smoothly on high settings. The other extent to which I will use my PC will be browsing on the internet ie. watching high quality streams and videos, redditing via several tabs, downloading videos and doing university work.  Large memory/hard drive is not needed, 1 TB will be sufficient. Fast

**What is your maximum preferred budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?** 
I guess less than 1300$ due to the fact that I've splashed more than this on a laptop. I may be willing to go up just for that bit extra if necessary in your opinion

**When do you plan on building/buying the PC?** In the next few weeks.

**What, exactly, do you need included in the budget?** I am looking for the tower and all of its components. Information regarding the case and cooling components is greatly appreciated (ie. do I need the case + extra fans, etc.) I intend to have my PC hooked up via a wireless connection too. I wish to purchase mouse, keyboard and monitor on my own but any recommendations are appreciated.   
 
**Which country will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in the US, are you near a Microcenter store?**
I currently live in Switzerland, however I may purchase the parts in Sweden.

**If there's any specific features you want/need from the rig, please list them.**
 I don't know what RAIDing is and if this is the case I've read that i don't need it. I know presentation is usually at the bottom of the list when regarding a rig but I would quite like to have a sexy designed Tower much like the [NZXT Phantom Series](http://www.nzxt.com/product/detail/95-phantom-410-mid-tower-case.html) or a simple elegant design like the [H Series](http://www.nzxt.com/product/detail/103-h2-case). An HDMI port will be wanted and 3 or more USB ports will suffice (as I imagine 1 for Mouse, 1 for Keyboard and 1 for a USB key)

**Do you already have a legit and reusable/transferable OS key/license?** 
I am not to sure if I can transfer my Windows 7 64 bit license or not so include it in the price in case. I will not go for Windows 8 as I heard it was poor (is this true?).

**Extra info or specifics:**
I am a newbie at computer building and have only brought overpriced laptops in the past to hope that they would perform as a PC Desktop by playing many games, having many tabs/videos open. I am not a heavy, heavy PC gamer in terms of quantity of games played, I normally just play games like DOTA 2 a lot with friends for several hours. However I do want quality when I play thus hopefully my budget will allow for the best of the best.

I know enough to know that I don't know a lot. So I am still debating whether or not building a computer myself is right for me, or if I should order a pre-built one, or even simply purchase one at the store. I would rather just buy one at the store that suits my gaming needs but I'm not sure you really get your moneys worth that way or if that is even a viable option anymore. 

Anyway, a few years back I became the sole-care provider of my parents and money has since been tight. My last gaming computer died about 2 years ago (it was bought in 2004 and owed me absolutely nothing, that machine deserves to have a memorial erected in its honor). I didn't have enough money to buy a new gaming rig so I bought a low budget laptop (not to play games) to keep me sane and it accomplishes what it was bought to do wonderfully. But not gaming for 2 years has made me batty. I have managed to save a little money and I think it is about time to finally buy a new gaming computer.

**What will you be doing with this PC? Gaming? Photoshop? Web browsing? etc. If you need a Workstation, be specific on the programs you'll be using.**
movies, music, emulators, games (World of Warcraft: Mists of Pandaria, Diablo III, guild wars 2, looking into Neverwinter too, etc.)

**What is your maximum preferred budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?**
I would like to keep it around $400 - 500 but I would be willing to bump it up to $600 if that meant a decent increase in quality and longevity.

**When do you plan on building/buying the PC? (note: if you're planning on buying more than 2 weeks from now, it's very much recommended you wait and come back then, to ensure you get the most recent and accurate price data)**
asap (within the next two weeks)

**What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? ""Everything"" is not specific enough. Just the tower? Operating System? Keyboard, mouse, monitor, speakers/headset, WiFi adapter, etc?**
Just the tower. I have a keyboard, mouse, headset, speakers, and my old monitor. I do not have an OS but I can manage that at the store or something

**Which country will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in the US, are you near a Microcenter store?**
US. Upstate Ny, closest Micro Center to my knowledge is near NYC so about a 6 hour drive away, so no on that.

**If reusing any parts, what parts will you be reusing? Please be especially specific about the power supply. List make and model. If you have a monitor, list the size/resolution.**
I have my old Logitech wireless mouse and a keyboard. I have some speakers too. I have an old dell monitor (I think it's 3 or 4 years old) I have no idea what resolution the monitor is but I think it is around 20in. I'm ok with using these still but if I had to upgrade them for whatver reason I think I could manage that.

**Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line?**
Nope. Wouldn't know how even if I wanted. 

**If there's any specific features you want/need from the rig, please list them. Examples might include rear and/or front-panel USB 3.0, a RAID setup, etc.**
I would just like to be able to play games on it. On my old rig I had to play games on the lowest possible setting and I would still lag and get bad fps. So I would like to be able to play games at a decent setting while not feeling like I'm looking at a slide show. One other feature I would really like is a Dual Monitor setup if at all possible.
 
**Do you already have a legit and reusable/transferable OS key/license? If yes, what OS? Is it 32bit or 64bit.**
I do not. But again, I think I can manage purchasing a copy at the store or something on my own.

I think that's it. I really really appreciate anyone who took the time to read and respond. So thanks in advance for any help.

•&gt;What is your maximum preferred budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?
I have a budget of £800 ($1200)

•&gt;When do you plan on building/buying the PC? (note: if you're planning on buying more than 2 weeks from now, it's very much recommended you wait and come back then, to ensure you get the most recent and accurate price data)
I may not be building this until later this year but I would like to know the kind of machine I could be getting for the money. I do not need the most accurate price data, just a rough guideline.

•&gt;What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? ""Everything"" is not specific enough. Just the tower? Operating System? Keyboard, mouse, monitor, speakers/headset, WiFi adapter, etc?
I need a tower, os, keyboard and mouse (I like the look of the Sharkoon fireglider black and the Sharkoon Skiller) and a 1080p monitor.

•&gt;Which country will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in the US, are you near a Microcenter store?
I will be purchasing parts in the UK.

•&gt;If reusing any parts, what parts will you be reusing? Please be especially specific about the power supply. List make and model. If you have a monitor, list the size/resolution.
I am not reusing parts.

•&gt;Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line?
It is unlikely that I will overclock as I do not wish to risk damaging components.

•&gt;If there's any specific features you want/need from the rig, please list them. Examples might include rear and/or front-panel USB 3.0, a RAID setup, etc.
I would like to have front panel USB 3.0. It is unlikely that I will use RAID. I may want the option for SLI/Crossfire in the future.

•&gt;Do you already have a legit and reusable/transferable OS key/license? If yes, what OS? Is it 32bit or 64bit?
No.

•&gt;Extra info or specifics:
I would like this build to last me as long as possible.

Thanks.

Gaming? Photoshop? Web browsing? etc. If you need a Workstation, be specific on the programs you'll be using.

Gaming. Games like Dota 2, Warframe, BF3/4, Tera. Internet. Not really much else; I have a laptop for working.  

&gt;What is your maximum preferred budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?

$400~$500

&gt;When do you plan on building/buying the PC? (note: if you're planning on buying more than 2 weeks from now, it's very much recommended you wait and come back then, to ensure you get the most recent and accurate price data)

Probably beginning of summer. I just want to see what I could get right now if i reuse my old PC.

&gt;What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? ""Everything"" is not specific enough. Just the tower? Operating System? Keyboard, mouse, monitor, speakers/headset, WiFi adapter, etc?

Just the Tower. I have a 120 GB Kingston SSD, so SATA 3 is a must, but I also want a 500GB~1TB HDD drive as well. Wifi adapter too since an Ethernet connection is waaaaay too far from my room.

&gt;Which country will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in the US, are you near a Microcenter store?

SoCal, US. Yes! Microcenter. 

&gt;If reusing any parts, what parts will you be reusing? Please be especially specific about the power supply. List make and model. If you have a monitor, list the size/resolution.

I have an ENTIRE computer to use. Well, basically. The HP Pavilion a6700y was my 1st desktop that my parents bought for me in 2009. 

http://reviews.cnet.com/desktops/hp-pavilion-a6700y/4507-3118_7-33527333.html

I have no clue if I can reuse any parts... I'm thinking no, but maybe the case/ wifi adapter?

&gt;Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line?

Yes! Really interested in pushing everything to its limits without burning out. :) Been overclocking my android since I've gotten it.

&gt;If there's any specific features you want/need from the rig, please list them. Examples might include rear and/or front-panel USB 3.0, a RAID setup, etc.

Wifi Adapter chip (or can I reuse the one in the a6700y?) Not really anything else... 

&gt;Do you already have a legit and reusable/transferable OS key/license? If yes, what OS? Is it 32bit or 64bit?

I have a license on the SSD (windows home premium x64), but currently its in an m15x i got from my friend (since she upgraded to a macbook.. weird story.) 

&gt;Extra info or specifics:

If I were to sell the m15x, how much do you think I would get? I know; totally weird, and maybe inappropriate  question. (I'd have to sell without a hard drive though)

But if i sell the M15X I'd probably be able to increase my budget. 

http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16834200048

Also, if possible, I'd like a MoBo that can be upgraded in the future (in terms of CPU/ or GPU so if I were to build a computer later, it wouldn't have to start from scratch.)

I've heard about Haswell, but I'm not sure if its only for laptops. I'd probably wait if they're for desktops as well. ",,False,self,t5_2tjcr,False,,,True,t3_1e5aa5,http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcforme/comments/1e5aa5/500_gaming_pc_microcenter_and_reusing_old_hp/,

I'm starting my own video/photo business and I need something that can edit video for the next two to five years, which means 4k RAW, which means I'm gonna need something better than my old Mac Pro that can barely play H.264 video.  I saw [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcforme/comments/1d8bt8/gamingvideo_editing_pc_up_to_3500/) from a few days ago but I'm not sure if this build is exactly what I need as well.  I could spend more or less depending on...what I need.  So:

**What will you be doing with this PC? Gaming? Photoshop? Web browsing? etc. If you need a Workstation, be specific on the programs you'll be using.**

Mostly I'll be using Adobe creative suite software for video and photo editing.  I really need the ability to handle uncompressed 4k RAW video or better.  I intend to run a dual monitor setup, but the second screen is mostly gonna be used for menus; I need my main monitor to work for color correction, so video quality is important on that one.

**What is your maximum preferred budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?**

$4,000.  The more I can save here, however, the more I can spend on something equally important to my video business; good lenses are expensive.

**When do you plan on building/buying the PC? (note: if you're planning on buying more than 2 weeks from now, it's very much recommended you wait and come back then, to ensure you get the most recent and accurate price data)**

As soon as possible.  I need to start working!

**What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? ""Everything"" is not specific enough. Just the tower? Operating System? Keyboard, mouse, monitor, speakers/headset, WiFi adapter, etc?**

I need a tower; one good monitor; Windows 7; wireless mouse/keyboard; and a WiFi card.

**Which country will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in the US, are you near a Microcenter store?**

I'm in the US, but no Microcenters are nearby.

**If reusing any parts, what parts will you be reusing? Please be especially specific about the power supply. List make and model. If you have a monitor, list the size/resolution.**

My old monitor is just an Acer that runs 1440x1080, DVI.

**Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line?**

Probably not.  Unless I should...

**If there's any specific features you want/need from the rig, please list them. Examples might include rear and/or front-panel USB 3.0, a RAID setup, etc.**

Fast and easy data transfer for video is always a plus.  Many camera systems use SSD drives that can be accessed via Thunderbolt, but I'll also be pulling video off CF and SD cards from DSLRs.  The more formats I can work with the better.  I also hear that RAID is a good idea for working with big video files.

**Do you already have a legit and reusable/transferable OS key/license? If yes, what OS? Is it 32bit or 64bit?**

Nope.  I think I'll need 64 bit Windows 7, due to the Adobe suite's [requirements](http://www.adobe.com/products/creativesuite/production/tech-specs.html).

**Extra info or specifics:**

Having my boot drive be an SSD would be preferred. Like I said, RAID is probably needed, as is plenty of space.  Lots of ways of getting media in is good.  I'll be using external storage to supplement this box's hard drives, as well.

* What is your maximum preferred budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?

I hope for around 2000 USD, but can go up to 2500 USD


* When do you plan on building/buying the PC?  

Buying piece meal, I know how to find good prices on various sites, as well as find good rebates.


* What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? 

Tower, Storage, CPU, CPU cooler, Mother board, Memory, video card, sound card (if necessary), case, power supply, monitor(s), I guess an optical drive as well.  If you want to include peripherals you like, feel free, though they don't count towards the total cost of the tower.  I do need a wireless adapter that is compatible with a Linksys WRT54G.


* Which country will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in the US, are you near a Microcenter store?

USA, Sugar land Texas precisely.  Nearest microcenter appears to be about an hour away.


* If reusing any parts, what parts will you be reusing? 

No reused parts as I only have a laptop

* Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line?

I don't know how to overclock, so currently no.


* If there's any specific features you want/need from the rig, please list them.

I don't know too much about this section, I know I need a usb 3.0 front and back.  SSD preferable.  I'm possibly interested in liquid cooled, but I'd need some extra links on how to set that all up.  Probably not good for a first time builder.

Thunderbolt is preferable. HDMI out (as said earlier) would be cool. Lots of storage space and an SSD. I dig minimal styling when it comes to the case. So far I've seen some fractal-design cases I like. Anything else like that (or one of theirs) would be good.

I plan on starting a build in the next couple of weeks.
*Note - I am willing to wait if things generally get cheaper over the next couple of months. Not opposed to buying some parts now, some parts later.

&gt;What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? ""Everything"" is not specific enough. Just the tower? Operating System? Keyboard, mouse, monitor, speakers/headset, WiFi adapter, etc?

I have an operating system, mouse, keyboard and monitor. 

&gt;Which country will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in the US, are you near a Microcenter store?

US - Microcenter &lt;20mns away. 

&gt;If reusing any parts, what parts will you be reusing? Please be especially specific about the power supply. List make and model. If you have a monitor, list the size/resolution.

1920x1080 Hanspree monitor. 

&gt;Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line?
Would do if I can get more bang for my buck that way.

&gt;If there's any specific features you want/need from the rig, please list them. Examples might include rear and/or front-panel USB 3.0, a RAID setup, etc.

Would like to be able to output video to two sources, bluetooth, I like usb ports..front, back, side..

&gt;Do you already have a legit and reusable/transferable OS key/license? If yes, what OS? Is it 32bit or 64bit?

Yes, 64bit

(budget of £900)",8,2,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcforme/comments/1cvm80/sent_here_from_rbuildapc_looking_to_buy_another/,"Hello BuildAPC! around 8 months ago we used this website http://www.pcspecialist.co.uk/pcs/[1] to build our own gaming PC. Neither of us have any computer building experience and didn't trust ourselves to try! Anyway I posted a list of specs I'd put together on there to BuildAPC to make sure everything would work correctly and got the green light, so we bought it.


(I know its frowned upon to get it built elsewhere as you end up paying more, but after researching all the parts separately we found we were only paying around £50 extra anyway, and would guarantee success whereas I'd probably blow the house up doing it myself!) We received the PC in less than 2 weeks and have very much enjoyed maxed out gaming.


Now, I'd like to look for another gaming PC for my boyfriend who is jumping over to PC from console as I have done, we have a budget of around £900 (inc. VAT) I'd go for the same specs as the one we already have but with 8 months of new technology I thought I'd ask for your help to compile a new list of hardware.


I hope its not too much to ask for you to list the hardware thats available on the website to make a reliable gaming PC that will max out most games, with a budget of £900!


Just in case you'd like an idea of what my current PC is:
Intel® Core™i5 Quad Core Processor i5-3570K (3.4GHz) 6MB Cache


ASUS® P8Z77-V LX: USB 3.0, SATA 6GBs, ATI®CrossFireX


8GB KINGSTON HYPER-X GENESIS DUAL-DDR3 1600MHz, X.M.P (2 x 4GB KIT)


2GB AMD RADEON™ HD7870 - DVI,HDMI,2 mDP - DX® 11, Eyefinity 4 Capable


1TB WD CAVIAR BLACK WD1002FAEX, SATA 6 Gb/s, 64MB CACHE (7200rpm)


CORSAIR 650W ENTHUSIAST SERIES™ TX650 V2-80 PLUS® BRONZE


SPIRE GEMINI REV.3-THERMAX HDT TWIN FAN CPU COOLER


&gt;What will you be doing with this PC? Mainly gaming, with a little video editing.


&gt;What is your maximum preferred budget before rebates/shipping/taxes? £800 (£1000 inc. VAT)


&gt;When do you plan on building/buying the PC? ASAP!


&gt;What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? Everything - PC case, harddrive, GPU, CPU, RAM, power supply, CPU Cooler, Sound card, MoBo, wifi, OS, keyboard and mouse (monitor not needed!)


&gt;Which country will you be purchasing the parts in? UK

Primarily HD video editing in Adobe Premiere and After Effects.

*What is your maximum preferred budget?*
$2000, but if I could spend less without losing significant performance, great. I'm all for value.

Tower only.

*If reusing any parts, what parts will you be reusing?*
I already own two Shimian Achieva (27"" 2560x1440) displays and a Corsair 800 tower.

Stability is as important to me as speed, so probably not, but I don't know anything.

Front-panel USB 3.0, At least 2TB of HD space and an SSD for OS and programs.

I would like to be able to run Mac OSX, but if that creates major limitations/complications, I am fine with running a Windows OS. And I believe I have a student copy of the Windows OS somewhere.

&gt; What is your maximum preferred budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?

Really no budget, though I suppose &lt; $3000. I don't want to skimp on this.

Anytime in the next year or so but again, no specific deadline or time limit.

Operating System? Keyboard, mouse, monitor, speakers/headset, WiFi adapter, etc?

I already have a Razer DeathAdder mouse and my OS &amp; all the software I need. All I need help on is the hardware aspect. I have absolutely no hardware at the moment and I don't know where to start. I guess everything in the tower itself, a screen, headset, and speakers.

No reusing of parts (other than mouse). All I have is a laptop right now.

No, no overclocking

&gt; If there's any specific features you want/need from the rig, please list them. Examples might include rear and/or front-panel USB 3.0, a RAID setup, etc.

Just the basics: 4 USB (2.0 or 3.0, doesn't matter) + SD card slot + CD/DVD drive : all on the front &amp; 2 more USB on the rear of the console

Now from the sidebar:

What will you be doing with this PC?

* Mostly gaming. I'm a huge PC gamer with tons of PC games of Steam, but am unable to play most of them due to my current laptop.
* I also use a lot of video editing/modeling programs such as Sony Vegas, Blender, Cinema 4D, Photoshop.
* Web browsing. Alot of it, mostly reddit.


What is your maximum preferred budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?

* Within the next couple months.

What, exactly, do you need included in the budget?

* Literally everything. PC, Monitor, Keyboard, Mouse, Speakers.

Will you be overclocking?

* Probably not.

Do you already have a legit and reusable/transferable OS key/license?

* No, but I should be able to get one fairly cheap. Most likely Windows 7 x64-bit

I've been primarily a mac user my whole life frankly I'm a bit daunted by the number of choices and options out there, but I'd like to have a pc dedicated to gaming as it'd be nice to be able to run games like Skyrim and Guildwars 2 on high/ultra.
  
I do all my graphics/web surfing/computery stuff on my mac, so I'd pretty much just use this pc for gaming.  Ideally I'd like something that would be able to hold its own for a bit down the road.  I'd rather spend a bit extra now for something that will hold up well for a few years rather than skimp out.

Looking at a lot of the builds on here, many seem to go for overclocking. As a brand new PC builder guy who doesn't have the first clue about overclocking, is that something worth trying to figure out?  If I'm looking to make this computer as reasonably future-proof as I can afford, would it be worth going that route, or should I just keep it simple and not worry about it? 

I would be buying everything online, I've got a monitor and mouse already but would need everything else. Keyboard, OS, and tower of course. I greatly appreciate any help or bits of advice you might be able to offer.

looking to overclock, would like an SSD and roughly a 1TB mechanical drive

aiming to spend £1200 could stretch to £1300 if justified.

needs to also include a keyboard (ideally mechanical but probably unrealistic based on the budget as i would probably benefit putting the money elsewhere in the build) &amp; mouse

need a monitor, not sure whether to go for a 120hz/144hz TN panel or use an IPS panel?

already have windows 7 so will probably use that and upgrade to windows 8 at a later date

planning to build as soon as possible however am willing to wait if it is highly recommended for some reason.

I am ideally looking for a PC to game on as I have my laptop for day to day... Ideally able to run most current games at decent settings, as I am a student, when I am working next year I plan to catch up with bioshock infinite and borderlands etc.

Ideally £800 is the max, however, if needed an operating system can be removed from this budget... Although i am asking for a reasonable monitor to be included in the price. Therefore I need the tower and monitor out of the price. I was thinking around £150 for monitor and £650 for tower roughly however it is flexible!

This is my first build so I am not planning to overclock anytime soon, but I would like it to be able to last a few years and parts be re-usable later if possible...

AMD or Intel i don't mind,whatever you think is right for the budget! Thanks

Gaming indefinitely, hopefully at relatively high settings. I'm looking to play most games that you guys could think of, because I'm switching over from console. BF3, Minecraft, Skyrim, TF2 are some examples.

I got into League of Legends a couple years ago and Guild Wars 2 recently, and I've been playing these two games on my laptop that I got 3 years ago for school, but I think my laptop is starting to give out on me or something since I keep freezing and lagging. I've been saving up money for about 6 months now, and I think I can finally start buying parts for a new PC, but I have no idea how to start on a build. So, I was wondering if you guys could help me build a pc.

I want to build a PC specifically for these two games so I can play them at the highest setting in the most efficient way possible. I haven't dealt with PC hardware in a long while, and I'm unsure of how to cater my build specifically to these two games.

On top of all this, I'm limited in my budget so I might have to buy some of these parts over a couple weeks. I have an Amazon credit card so anything that's cheapest on Amazon would be a plus for me. I want this to be a hassle-free build that I can keep with low maintenance for a long while but easy to upgrade should the need rises maybe a year or two down the road, so I guess I'm not looking to overclock or anything, but I'm open to it if that's the best way to go about it.

I do have speakers and a mouse, but no monitor so I'm hoping that $800 will be enough to buy the PC itself, monitor, and a decent keyboard. I think I can get an OS through my University. Oh and lastly I don't live near a microcenter.

* Gaming PC specifically for League of Legends and Guild Wars 2.

* Budget of around ~$800 for PC, monitor, and keyboard.

* Preferably no overclocking but open to it.

* Prefers Amazon as shipper.

* May have to buy parts over a couple weeks.

- It's pretty easy to stream music on anything these days, so I'm looking more for music storage and decent sound quality

I'm looking to build just the computer at this point (no peripherals), but would love to learn about *why* each part is being recommended (i.e. what they do, how they work together). I understand some aspects concerning how the guts of a computer work, but want to really understand it deeply if any educational sources or advice can be offered.

The goal of the build:
I'd like to be able to play some games such as Fallout New Vegas (with a boat load of mods if it can be handled), Left 4 Dead, the S.T.A.L.K.E.R series, Metro 2033, Civ 5, and perhaps FarCry 3. I'll likely be running a PS2 emulator as well, and am working on learning how a stronger pc will allow better anti-aliasing and resolution from my PS2 library. Being able to ramp up the graphics on games is nice, but I'm really looking to be able to play games without slowdown and stagger when multiple enemies, explosions, etc. are on screen; so recommendations on where I should put the graphic settings on something like Fallout 3 or New Vegas would be kind.

A few things beyond the games I'm looking to play:
I have the potential to get an Intel processor for a substantial discount, most likely a third gen i7. I'm non-prejudiced between Intel and AMD, and really just want to get what works best. Is the newest always the best in these things? Also, is there anything in particular I should keep in mind for being able to augment the pc down the line with newer or different parts? Should I look for a mobo that exceeds my intial needs or some such, and how can I know what the needs of the parts are?

I appreciate any help and input, and hope I can help contribute here eventually.

Edit: I forgot to say that I'll be needing an OS as part of the build. I have no qualms with Windows 8, so long as it won't interfere with the gameplay. A case can be kept out of the budget, but recommendations are welcome. Any thoughts on using a 720p 40 inch flatscreen TV as the monitor would also be appreciated.

Budget is as low as possible ($600 would be lovely) but &lt; $900.

I don't want to overclock.


I'm a software developer and frequently do multicore'd/high end data crunching. The machine I want to build will be for home use, but I'll still be programming on it. I don't write to disk too often; most of my storage usage is over the network. An SSD is overkill, unless it's cost effective to get in there.


I need a core i5 for the virtualization options and the 4 cores. I can't justify the cost of the i7 for hyperthreading, no matter how badly I want it.


The graphics card should be able to play something like Dishonored at above average options (or better), if possible -- and if it can't (e.g. only normal/below average), have the option to upgrade the graphics card later. I'm not sure what that entails for the PSU.

I also wanted to play around with GPU programming and utilize the pipelines for number crunching. Not sure if any card makes that easier or harder.

**Also for the love of all that is holy the graphics card *CANNOT* have nVidia Optimus.** I dual boot linux, and Optimus is a clusterfuck with it. I'm aware of [Bumblebee](http://bumblebee-project.org/) but it works poorly with virtualization and wine, plus it's a bit cumbersome. 

This is my current laptop:

I've been looking to get a new desktop. The current one I use is a Dell Studio Slim shared between me and my dad. So I'd like to get my own PC. Saving up all my money, with a bit of help from my dad, gives me a maximum $800 budget. 

The current Dell is still going to be used by my dad, so nothing can be recycled from it. Therefore I will need things like a monitor. (I own a gaming mouse so I won't need a new one, and I can find a cheap keyboard by myself but a cheap recommendation is welcome.)

I have a laptop for most of my school needs (kind of required for college nowadays), but both the laptop (Dell Inspiron from 2009) and desktop are pretty lame for gaming. I want to be able to play Diablo III (currently I have it on absolute lowest settings), Tropico 4, Minecraft, The Sims 3, and other games without too much bother. Max settings aren't necessary, but I'd like for it to not look like poop.

An OS is also necessary. I'd prefer Vista or 7, not 8. I think I still have my Microsoft Office disks so that's not necessary.

I have a 1TB external, so the hard drive doesn't have to be a beast. Just enough to save my music and some Steam games. I think 500GB would be plenty.

I don't know anything about RAM (my current has like 6 or 8GB I think?) so I'm trusting those of you more knowledgeable to help me get a good set-up.

**So, quick breakdown:**

$800 US max.

General gaming.

OS (MS Vista or 7.)

Decent monitor. (Cheap rec. for keyboard/speakers etc. would be appreciated. Mouse already owned.)

~500GB hard drive.



I'm not very good with computers so if there's anything else I need but haven't specified please tell me.

I hope to have a friend help me learn to put it together (I learn much better from in person than videos on YouTube) but if he isn't available I might have to use an online build service. One of the mods was helpful and recommended NCIX. I will probably have a separate stash of cash for the fee if it comes to using a service, so hopefully the $800 can be reserved fully for the PC and I'll find another ~$50 for the service if required.

As I explained to the mod, I know it probably sounds wasteful to spend money on a building service, but I do not trust myself at all with electronics and would need my friend to guide me through the process and if he's not free I won't be able to do it. And I just want to get the best that is for my money.

Thank you very much in advance and if you need more information please ask.

Edit: I also don't know what overclocking is so don't plan on me doing it. Haha.

**Pointless Exposition**

I've been looking to build a pc for a little while now and I've been doing a good amount of research, but I'm still not at the point at which I'm comfortable picking out everything alone, so I was hoping to see what kind of suggestions you guys could come up with. As the title says, I have been saving up for a while now and would be happy to spend 2000 dollars, perhaps even a little more. I assume it goes fast, especially since I have absolutely nothing currently other than a dinky monitor and keyboard and mouse I am eager to replace. Also, I live in the US.

**PC Uses**

Anyway, I plan on this PC being used for a pretty diverse range of things, possibly by multiple people with a wide range of interests. So I'll start with possible uses:

**1)** A component in a sort of home theater system. So, storing high-quality movies and then hooking it up to an HDTV and surround sound system. I assume this will mostly require a lot of storage and just an HDMI out? Are sound or video cards important for this?

**2)** An audio recording and editing station. I don't know much about how this would work beyond purchasing an audio interface and studio monitors. Does the kind of stuff that is done by the PC for this require a good CPU, or possibly even a good GPU?

**3)** An image storing and editing tool for an aspiring photographer/designer. I imagine, besides storage, that this requires a pretty decent GPU?

**4)** A tool for video editing. A good GPU, I imagine, plus storage?

**5)** A sort of playground for a learning computer and programming enthusiast. I assume I am eventually going to want to run VMs and do other weird stuff I don't know about yet.

**6)** As good a gaming computer as possible while still satisfying the other conditions and falling into the budget. It doesn't need to be amazing as this isn't a top priority. Being able to run stuff like Morrowind and Oddworld would be desirable and I assume relatively simple(?), running something like Fallout New Vegas or Team Fortress 2 or even console emulators would be great. I don't know how this will work exactly because the whole GPU/CPU thing is still relatively new to me, and I've been reading about how some games rely more on the CPU than others.

**Neuroses Which May Affect Components**

As you can tell I'm not 100% sure what the heck I'm doing. Here is a tidbit about me which may help: I am a bit of a weenie. I like to play it safe whenever possible. So I probably won't be overclocking (which I assume means I won't need an Intel cpu ending in 'k'?). I'm sort of neurotic about things. In fact, I'd like the coolest, safest, quietest pc I could possibly get. If underclocking is a thing that people actually do (I know it at least exists because I've seen the word) then I would probably be happy to do it most of the time. Though I'm not absolutely familiar with how it works or the terminology I would also like to run two HDDs in a RAID 1 set-up. So unfortunately this is the kind of person you'll be helping out here, sorry. 

**My Limited Knowledge of Parts / What I've Been Recommended**

As far as specific parts, for the **CPU** people have heavily recommended I get an Intel Core i7, which sounds like a decent idea from what I've read, but again, I'm not entirely sure what I'm doing, and there are a lot of them. Benchmarks are helpful but mostly I see them discussing games, which isn't my main concern. Someone has suggested the 3820 because it uses a newer socket (the LGA-2011 I think?) which apparently is better but I do not know exactly why, and though I have heard it would make for easy upgrades to 39xx cpus (or something of the sort) I have also heard the word Haswell being tossed around by naysayers saying not to bother. 

I know nothing about the **motherboard**. Most people tell me to just shush and pick everything else out first and then the motherboard will practically choose itself given that it relies on the cpu socket and how many SATA and PCI-e connections I want. I do not know how true this is.

Regarding the **memory** situation, people have pretty much simply recommended I get 16gb of DDR3-1600 memory. I realize DDR3 is just the newest type of RAM? And 1600 is the speed? I've heard arguments that the speed doesn't matter but I don't know if this is the case. I also don't know anything about the brands. Additionally, someone once recommended I get 32gb. Is this insane? Would I not need 4 sticks of 8gb each, or do they come in more than that? And if not, would I need a specific cpu and motherboard to do this?


For **storage**, as I mentioned before, I would like to run a RAID 1 set-up with two HDDs. I've heard people say to stay away from each and every brand, so I don't know what I should believe. 3TB and with a nice long warranty would be ideal. I've also been told that I wouldn't regret, with the money I am willing to spend, purchasing an SSD for my OSes (I was thinking of dual-booting with Windows and Linux) and my most heavily used applications. Don't know much about that. 

The **video card** I haven't done much research on although I realize it's pretty important. 

The same thing goes for the **case**. Mostly I want it to be well-ventilated above all else. I don't care that much how it looks, although of course a nice sleek-looking case would be preferred. I watched that newegg video about how to build a pc that seems to be posted every so often on boards related to this one, and the case he had there in the first part seemed very convenient and easy to work with and everything (I think it was the Corsair Obsidian 650d or something). I don't know if people would normally laugh at my saying that but again my knowledge is limited.

The **power supply** I know absolutely nothing about. I assume it just comes down to how much power I would need, which is determined by the other parts?

As far as **other stuff**, I do not have an **operating system**; I'd like to have a version of Windows. I don't know how much all of this is going to run. I may have exceeded my budget. If not it would be very cool to tuck away some of that money to put towards a nice **monitor** (I have one but it's sort of small and lame) and eventually I do want to get a **mechanical keyboard**.

**TL;DR**

I want to make a pc that can be used for lots of stuff: watching movies in a home theater, audio recording and editing, video editing, image and photo editing, programming and generally geekily screwing around, and medium gaming if at all possible. I'd very much like to have two HDDs set-up in RAID 1 as well as an SSD. I like to prioritize stability and safety and reliability, if that at all affects the build (so I probably won't overclock with this). I have around 2000 dollars to spend, though going slightly over isn't impossible. I need an operating system as well (and would like Windows) and it would be nice to also be able to get a monitor.

I would like a build that can play some games that necessarily aren't graphically intense (League of Legends) and play the newest releases at a medium (maybe high, but max isn't necessary) settings. I typically play older games (Still need to play Bioshock and DA:O because it's a shame to not be able to enjoy those games).

However, I am also looking for a build that can video capture gameplay and be able to video edit them. Nothing like after-effects, but as long as I can seemlessly cut and edit clips together without heavy load/lag times. I want to be able to make ESPN-style analysis on gameplay (with the arrows, circles, and John Madden commentary) type videos using programs like Kinovea.

Other details:

- No need for a mouse/monitor/keyboard/OS

- As for the HD, you can recommend a standard HD if it fits within the budget, but I'll probably look into SSD once I have a better starting point. Most likely I will be storing video clips on larger externals and using what I need in the internal. Thus the HD is the lowest priority for parts.

- I don't need overclocking although hopefully the budget will allow for a build that won't go obsolete in a few years. If it will, let me know.

- I do live reasonably near a microcenter. Don't know if this is important or not, but just going to throw that out there if there are some good parts to be bought there. 

I am completely new when it comes to building pcs and I hope I did not break any rules within this subreddit. Thank you again for helping me find a starting point.

May have gotten caught in a filter somewhere.  I've messaged the mods over there but in the meantime I was hoping I might find some help here.

I've thrown together these two potential builds for my parents, one with an APU and the other with an i3 and discrete card.  My parents have a horrible old Dell laptop that isn't doing anything for them anymore and have come to me for something new.

In all reality they will just be using it for light stuff.  Internet, music, YouTube, office.  Probably not much more.  While I know future proofing is hard, I would like the system to be somewhat upgradeable.  I don't want to tell them a few years down the line that they need a whole new system.  I'd rather be able to upgrade specific parts to cut costs.

What do you think?  Would one be better for them than the other?  Are one or both of them overkill for the intended use?  If I could save some downgrading, what would you downgrade?

I'm definitely open to any suggestions.

**NOTE:** Please don't tell me which is a better build.  I'm not asking which is better in general.  I'm looking for what is best specific to the needs stated above.

Thanks!

I write fortran 77 code which does an absurd amount of arithmetic including basic algebra, matrix arithmetic, matrix inversion, matrix diagonalization, numerical integration, montecarlo techniques, minimization of frighteningly complicated functions.  Could someone help me out? I'll not spend more than $1000 on it. The sidebar says give you my country, not sure why that's important (other than pricing) but I'm from the US.

I don't know much about hardware but I presume its a fancy processor I'm after? I currently don't know how to set up my code for running in parallel so I need real power in each processor too, not just a bajillion processors. Eventually I'll get my shit together and learn to take advantage of the parallel. Until then I'll just split my code up and run multiple instances at once. It would be nice to be able to upgrade the processor down the road. I'll not be dicking around with overclocking or anything fancy.

I think I'd like to do 8 gigs memory with the ability to upgrade to more if my needs change. 

As far as the HD I'd like to spend under $200 for as much space as I can get. I rarely need to write big files, but when I do I can easily be pushing 10 gigs an hour so I need space for stupidly large files. Also I never delete anything so I need to be able to keep all of the files I do write.

For the OS it'll be linux, probably ubuntu since that seems to be the most popular now. As far as graphics goes I'll only need to run the OS and plot fairly simple 2d and 3d figures so I shouldn't need a graphics card beyond what will be on the motherboard right?

The computer will almost always be on, and connected to ethernet for ssh-ing and sftp-ing from a laptop. I probably won't even put a monitor/keyboard/mouse on it. 

The enclosure can be ugly as hell. I want dirt cheap here, it'll probably be hidden in some corner. Though large might be nice for future upgrades and for simplicity of putting it together in the first place.

If you could explain (in laymen's terms) the reason for picking each piece of hardware I'd really appreciate it.

I am currently looking to build a custom PC that can handle the load of high quality gaming, video rendering, and remain COOL. I am looking to spend under $1500 but honestly the price is not as important as the stability and quality of the build.
 
The last time I built a PC was about 7 years ago and the technology, terms, and resources have all changed so much. I started doing research and my head is spinning! I am confused whether or not overclocking is important to me. I imagine it has become much more stable over the years. I have never been a fan of ATI or AMD but I realize many years have passed and their products may have become more reliable. If this is not the case I am willing to pay more for Intel/nVidia to avoid issues. Is SLI worth the investment or just for bleeding edge builds?

I am currently torn on upgrading the current pc or building a new one. I don't have too much to spend maybe 3-400 but need help deciding. The computer is used for work and as a media center pc. Sometimes I work from home testing web pages so i like to have all browsers open and some virtual box images open as well. When i'm not using the computer for work I mostly watch movies from my media library or play music. I don't play any games other than an occasional flash game or maybe an old sim city. Would like to make more music or edit video on it in the next couple years.  

My main problem now is last time I built this system it was mostly on hand me down parts a couple years back. SSDs were just coming out and grabbed a small 60gb for my boot drive now it's nearly full. Currently fluctuating from 11-6gb free and I think this is contributing to the general slowness of the computer as it improves when i uninstall some things. So obviously i need to upgrade this small ssd. My memory is also kinda low by today's standards. currently running only 4gb. I plan on building it myself I have build a few pc's but as the years progress i find more and more acronyms and specs polluting my impressions on what is best case scenarios. I currently live in the san diego, CA area and am planning some black friday runs to frys or some cyber monday deals to buy what is needed to get out of the slump and slowness currently being experienced. 

currently on the following:

* Windows 7 Ultimate (x64) Service Pack 1 (build 7601)
* 2.66 gigahertz Intel Core2 Duo
* Zalman ZF9225ATH Aero Flower Silent CPU Cooler LGA775 
* MB: ASUSTeK Computer INC. P5K SE Rev 1
* 4096 Megabytes Usable Installed Memory comprised of 
* 2x kingston ktc1g-udimm 1024MB ddr2 pc2-6400 
&amp; 2x ocz ocz2p800r21g 1024MB ddr2 pc2-6400   
* CSSD-V60GB2 [Hard drive] (60.02 GB)
* ST2000DL003-9VT166 [Hard drive] (2000.40 GB) data - documents music and videos
* NVIDIA GeForce 8800 GTS [Display adapter]
* VIZ VO47LFHDTV10A [Monitor] (47.1"")
* Atheros L1 Gigabit Ethernet 10/100/1000Base-T Controller
 connected to a Motorola SBG6580 DOCSIS 3.0 router and cox premier @ 31 Mbps / 3 Mbps
* ASUS DRW-24B1LT ATA Device [Optical drive]
* Power Supply: pS cooler master RS-600-PCARE3
* Antec Nine Hundred Black Steel ATX Mid Tower Computer Case


I'm hoping to use as many pieces from my current setup to offset the cost of rebuilding an entirely new system. I see some systems in the $300-$400 range on here just torn between a complete rebuild or replacing boot SSD with a larger one and and upgrading the memory to 8gb max the current set up has.


Big thanks in advance for any help here!

He can't seem to get decent frame rates even on the lowest settings in those games. Not entirely sure but he currently has AMD Athlon 7750 black edition, and asus M3N78-EM, 4gb of RAM and an Nvidia GTX460 (so glad he keeps boxes). Not sure if that's enough info to gauge his pc's level of performance.

I'd really like to surprise him with a whole bunch of parts on or around Christmas. What would be good for him, as far as, decent frame rates and possible streaming of his games? He also does freelance video editing so the machine would need to be fast enough for that as well. He's sulked a bit on the length of time it takes him to edit anything in vegas.

I'm generally looking for something that will run Skype and the game World of Warcraft(WoW) simultaneously, better than my current PC does right now. [Here's a screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/I9KXh.png) of what I believe shows what makes up my current computer. With both ""WoW"" and Skype running, WoW can average about 10fps on the lowest settings, but sometimes it drops to just a few frames during intense moments in the game.

Here are my requirements to what I'll need the PC I'm looking for to do, along with additional things I'd like but I suppose aren't really necessary.

Minimum: Run WoW(lowest settings) and Skype simultaneously while maintaining about 20fps in game and dropping to no less than about 10fps during intense in game moments.

Additional Things I'd Like: All my minimum requirements except with the WoW settings at medium(or ""Good"" settings, as it is put in game)

ADDITIONAL Things I'd Like: To play games such as ""League of Legends"" and ""Team Fortress 2"" on (at least)lowest settings while maintaining whatever a decent FPS for those games is (10fps at least?) during intense moments.

I have a keyboard and mouse(sucks but i can manage), both are ps2 I believe they're called, and an old monitor already. I don't believe I have an OS or case. I already have a graphics card lying around that I was never able to install in my current PC(might be I was just doing it wrong). The box says it's a 1GB DDR2 PCI Nvidia Geforce EVGA 9400 GT graphics card.  It's possible the card might just not work though so yea...

I know my $100-$225 budget isn't much, but with as old as my current PC is I'm guessing I can still manage to get an upgrade.
As for pre assembled computers, I've browsed cheap refurbished ones on Walmart's website and found a couple. [This one](http://www.walmart.com/ip/Dell-Refurbished-GX520-Desktop-PC-with-Intel-Pentium-4-Processor-2GB-Memory-250GB-Hard-Drive-and-Windows-7-Home-Premium-Monitor-Not-Included/21150617) and [this one](http://www.walmart.com/ip/eMachines-Refurbished-EL1360G-UW11P-Desktop-PC-with-AMD-Dual-Core-E-300-Processor-4GB-Memory-500GB-Hard-Drive-and-Windows-7-Home-Premium-Monitor-No/21097554).

I also do some video editing, so I'd like 16GB of RAM (sidenote, when did RAM start getting called Memory?). Hoping for 1TB HDD space or more with maybe a small SSD drive for applications and the OS. 

I'm in the United States.

I'm not too worried about case aesthetics, but I'd like as many 3.0 USB ports as is feasible. 

I have a soft cap of $2000. I could be talked into going a little higher if it seems worthwhile.

If there's any necessary additional info I'd be happy to provide it. 

Thanks!

&gt;What is your maximum preferred budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?

$750
&gt;When do you plan on building/buying the PC? (note: if you're planning on buying more than 2 weeks from now, it's very much recommended you wait and come back then, to ensure you get the most recent and accurate price data)

ASAP
&gt;What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? ""Everything"" is not specific enough. Tower, Operating System, peripherals like the keyboard, mouse, and monitor(s), wifi adapter, speakers/headphones, etc. are all relevant.

CPU, Motherboard, RAM, Hard drive, Video Card, Tower, Power Supply, probably an optical drive, very optional 
&gt;Which country will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in the US, are you near a Microcenter store?

Missouri, and no Microcenters around here
&gt;If reusing any parts, what parts will you be reusing? Please be especially specific about the power supply. List make and model. If you have a monitor, list the size/resolution.

I'll be using a TV as a monitor, frankly I'm not sure what the max resolution is.
&gt;Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?

I have no plans to, but it might be cool to be able to down the line. 
&gt;If there's any specific features you want/need from the rig, please list them. Examples might include rear and/or front-panel USB 3.0, a RAID setup, etc.

I'd prefer an Intel processor and Nvidia graphics card, but if there is an AMD processor that's equally good, but costs less go with it, same for Nvidia.
&gt;Do you have any specific case/tower preferences such as a window or LEDs, or do you have a preference for low-noise components?

Low-noise is preferred, but basically i just don't want it to sound like I'm flying a plane

From now till I decide what parts I want, I will probably revisit in a month but I can buy it any time.

&gt;What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? ""Everything"" is not specific enough. Tower, Operating System, peripherals like the keyboard, mouse, and monitor(s), wifi adapter, speakers/headphones, etc. are all relevant.

Everything inside the tower, OS, Monitor, wifi adapter
 
&gt;Which country will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in the US, are you near a Microcenter store?

Australia, I can buy anywhere to be honest and im happy to order online but id like to buy near my area, I live in brisbane. U-Mart is nice.

&gt;If reusing any parts, what parts will you be reusing? Please be especially specific about the power supply. List make and model. If you have a monitor, list the size/resolution.

Fresh start.

&gt;Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?

I dont think its necessary but im happy to overclock down the line. Im looking to expand in the future so you can keep it in mind but yea.

&gt;If there's any specific features you want/need from the rig, please list them. Examples might include rear and/or front-panel USB 3.0, a RAID setup, etc.

To be honest im flexible with anything, Id like to have a few 3.0's.

Web Browsing is a given, 3D Modeling and computational software for work (Solidworks, Catia, Inventor, Matlab), &amp; Gaming. Gaming is decidedly the number one focus here. I play a bit of everything, MOBAs, Strategy, RPG, and the occasional shooter, so figure League of Legends, Civ 5, Skyrim and Battlefield 3/Payday2/Bioshock Infinite/Saints Row 4 as examples. The goal is to run on max settings, and I'd love it if this could handle upcoming games like Watch Dogs and Titanfall on higher/highest settings.

&gt;What is your maximum preferred budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?

A bit over $1400 is the most I'm willing to pay, but my wallet would be grateful if I could keep things closer to $1200. Also, I'm totally new to this, so if the price range is outside of what I'm asking for, please let me know.

&gt;When do you plan on building/buying the PC? (note: if you're planning on buying more than 2 weeks from now, it's very much recommended you wait and come back then, to ensure you get the most recent and accurate price data)

Within the next week

CPU, Motherboard, RAM, HDD &amp; SSD, graphics card, case, power supply, monitor, keyboard

&gt;Which country will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in the US, are you near a Microcenter store?

US, I'm about 20 minutes away from the Rockville MD Microcenter store

&gt;Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?

I'd like to, but down the line.

&gt;If there's any specific features you want/need from the rig, please list them. Examples might include rear and/or front-panel USB 3.0, a RAID setup, etc.

Nothing too expensive in the way of an SSD (I probably don't need much more than 150 at most), USB 3.0

&gt;Do you have any specific case/tower preferences such as a window or LEDs, or do you have a preference for low-noise components?

A case window, tasteful LEDs, and low-noise components would be great, but aren't 100% necessary.

&gt;Do you already have a legit and reusable/transferable OS key/license? If yes, what OS?

yes, Windows 8 Professional

Gaming, web browsing, and streaming. As far a games go, a lot of open world, and MMO games. I'd very much like to use the highest settings.

&gt;What is your maximum preferred budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?

Maximum budget of $1200, I've got some leeway to go for a little more if I need too.

&gt;When do you plan on building/buying the PC? (note: if you're planning on buying more than 2 weeks from now, it's very much recommended you wait and come back then, to ensure you get the most recent and accurate price data)

Within the next few days, no longer than two weeks.

&gt;What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? ""Everything"" is not specific enough. Tower, Operating System, peripherals like the keyboard, mouse, and monitor(s), wifi adapter, speakers/headphones, etc. are all relevant.

Tower, OS, SSD &amp; HDD, Mechanical Keyboard, Gaming Mouse, Monitor (one to start with, but I will be switching to a dual setup), WiFi I'd like to be built into the motherboard (but getting an adapter wouldn't break my heart). I really do need everything but speakers and headphones, I'm upgrading from a 7 year old refurbished laptop. Edit: I forget to include a dvd drive/burner (possibly Bluray?)

&gt;Which country will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in the US, are you near a Microcenter store?

US, and I don't even live near a state with a Microcenter.

&gt;If reusing any parts, what parts will you be reusing? Please be especially specific about the power supply. List make and model. If you have a monitor, list the size/resolution.

Nothing reused.

&gt;Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?

My preference is no.

&gt;If there's any specific features you want/need from the rig, please list them. Examples might include rear and/or front-panel USB 3.0, a RAID setup, etc.

I support having USB 3.0/2.0 all over the place. My current laptop only has one USB port and it's been the bane of my existence.

&gt;Do you have any specific case/tower preferences such as a window or LEDs, or do you have a preference for low-noise components?

I could definitely go for a window on a blue tower. No LED's. And just as long as they aren't super loud components.

&gt;Do you already have a legit and reusable/transferable OS key/license? If yes, what OS?

I'll need brand new Windows 7/8.

&gt;Extra info or specifics:

If the peripherals are going to glow I'd prefer they do so in blue.


Any and all suggestions would be welcome,
Thanks from this first time builder.

Here's what i'm looking for specifically:

&gt;What will you be doing with this PC?

Mostly running 2d/3d modeling and animation softwares like Maya, 3DS Max, Blender, etc... Some adobe programs like photoshop, illusrator, flash, after effects... also, i frequently use Ableton Live 9 and other audio editing software, so good audio is a must. On the side, I hope to be able to run some newer games like Payday 2, Battlefield 4, Arma 3, as well as less intense games like League of Legends, Smite, etc... Focus more on the professional/school stuff though, and fit the games in if possible.

&gt;What is your maximum preferred budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?

~$2000, but going over some is fine, so long as it makes the computer run better.

&gt;When do you plan on building/buying the PC?

start ordering parts this weekend if possible (August 16-18, 2013)

&gt;What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? ""Everything"" is not specific enough. Tower, Operating System, peripherals like the keyboard, mouse, and monitor(s), wifi adapter, speakers/headphones, etc. are all relevant.

As said below, I'm only bringing over peripherals like monitor, mouse, etc. I'll need the tower case, mobo, cpu, gpu, storage drives (preferably NOT SSD unless you can explain why this might be beneficial to my uses, they're pretty expensive), power supply, RAM, cooling stuff, any necessary cables, yeah basically everything housed inside the case (sorry for saying everything, i just don't want to leave anything out for y'all) Oh, i'll also need a keyboard, but i'll probably just pick up a cheap usb one somewhere.

&gt;Which country will you be purchasing the parts in?

US, North Carolina area if that matters

&gt;If reusing any parts, what parts will you be reusing?

I have a usb mouse, vga monitor (1360x768 @ 60hz, 32""), and usb powered microphone/headphones with 3.5mm microphone and audio plugs, and a Wacom Cintiq 21UX pen display, which runs through vga and usb plugs. As you can see, those are all externals, so i will not be bringing over any internal parts.

&gt;If there's any specific features you want/need from the rig, please list them. Examples might include rear and/or front-panel USB 3.0, a RAID setup, etc.

As mentioned in carry-over section, I'd like a vga output port, an optional hdmi output port, one 3.5mm microphone output jack, one 3.5mm audio output jack, at least 2 usb ports (up to 4 preferable), and an ethernet wired internet port (if wireless internet capabilities would be possible for a little more, i'd be okay with the added versatility). In terms of internals, I'm gonna need a kickass gpu (and kickass video cards(s)  ) for fast/powerful rendering, a strong cpu, and a decent amount of storage space (~1tb?). My first and foremost use for the rig will be rendering animations and doing lots of visual work, so plan for whatever will help me process rendering like a beast. Also, if at least 1 usb port could be near the 3.5mm headphone ports that would be optimal. Some expansion ports on the mobo might be nice, in case i want to upgrade/add more video cards in the future (i think having more card power makes rendering faster, not 100% on that, sorry if i'm misinformed on this front)

&gt;Do you have any specific case/tower preferences such as a window or LEDs, or do you have a preference for low-noise components?

Focus on the performance aspects first, worry about the aesthetics second. I need quality over looks. The quieter it runs, the better, but don't sacrifice performance for volume. Also, i imagine it will need a pretty good cooling system since it will be used quite a lot for long, intense renderings.

&gt;Do you already have a legit and reusable/transferable OS key/license? If yes, what OS?

No. I like the layout of windows 7, but i've heard you can get 8 to look similar so i'd probably go with 8

&gt;extra info:

I'm really a newbie at building pc's, i'll have my friend to help me with the actual build but ordering parts is up to me.
