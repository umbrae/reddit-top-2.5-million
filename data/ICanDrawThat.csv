When I first started this subreddit lots of people told me that I shouldn't allow free graphic design work here.  That was a while ago, and this subreddit has grown exponentially since then.  I'd like to hear your thoughts on the matter so we can come up with some guidelines for this type of stuff.

Please upvote this for visibility, blah blah self post no karma.

Thanks,

tptbrg95

Edit:

The reason the rule was first implemented was that, as ghostcat states, ""it was always supposed to be an outlet for people to be creative off of random ideas"".  I didn't originally intend for this to be a place for graphic design to be done, free or paid.  There seems to be a lot of desire for GD work here, and I also don't want GD artists to feel like they have to do work for free.  That's why I'd like to know what the community wants.

Basically, do you want this subreddit to be more about random creativity, or more about fulfilling graphic design requests?

I see two choices:

1. Keep the rule requiring art to be free, and disallow graphic design here  

2. Get rid of the free work rule and allow GD. 

If you want the first option we can always create another subreddit for commissions.

I like to think of it as some sort of embodiment of my self-conscious. Think what you will about its legitimacy, but it struck me. It was a sort of anchor for me during the trip, and my mind goes back to it frequently, in points of stress (even when sober).

I'm hoping to make it a little more concrete, and if you guys could even do a rough sketch of the stuff I've described, I'd greatly appreciate it. I guess what I'm asking is, can you guys turn the vision in my head into a tangible image?

Here are the traits I can remember:

    Stands upright like a human. No tail or anything extra in the body section.

    Feminine form, but very powerful looking. The way the statue of david looks though, not like a bodybuilder. It was in all aspects female, but for some reason I knew it to be genderless.

    Dark grey-blue skin. 

    Flesh reminded me of the creatures in the tool video for schism

Now the crazy part. The head/face.

    Had a very feline face. Nose/eyes were definitely feline, but the mouth was more human (not the sort of cleft :3 look that cats typically have) with thin lips.

    Head came to a dull point above the forehead. Not sharp at all, more like the way your elbow comes to a point when your arm is bent, but slightly more acute.

    No ears

    Horns protruding horizontally out of the head with the point curling down, and ever so slightly inwards, but not enough to make a full spiral.

    Skin seemed to be battle-damaged, but long healed over. Like an old scar.

If you guys can help, it would mean the world to me. In my vision, it was in an empty blackness, and it was just this thing talking to me.

Cheers, have a great week.

Some of my artwork, so you can see my art style. http://imgur.com/a/qevMV

Everything I draw will be a pencil drawing and uploaded via scanner. I would color but I don't have photoshop at the moment.

[Edit:] I just want everyone to know, if I don't reply to your comment, it's not because I'm ignoring your request. I'm just waiting until 9pm EST to see how many requests add up, then I'll start the drawings. 

[Edit 2:] This is getting pretty big, a lot great requests. I'd just like to ask everyone that sees this to not post any requests after 9:30pm EST, just so I don't get confused and have to do math to figure out if you made it under the twelve hour mark. Thank you. 

[Edit 3:] Alright, it's been 12 hours. I'd be awesome if no one else posted anymore requests. I've gotten a lot of requests, and are drawing them on a first come first serve basis. This might take me a while to finish, maybe a couple weeks. But, I assure you, I'll finish every drawing.

[Edit 4:] I'm in the process of moving at the moment, it might be a while until I can upload again. I will be drawing the requests though, it will just be a while until I can upload them. 

[EDIT 5:] God, I hope this is the last edit I have to write. So, as I previously said, I just went through a big move to a new town. I haven't been on recently, but I do have five of the requests drawn, I just have to buy a new scanner. It should be tomorrow when I can upload them, maybe Tuesday. Then, I can get back on track to drawing all of them. 

[EDIT 6:] ((May 18, 2013. 7:18 EST)) 26 requests down, 68 to go. I just wanted to put this little update to let people know I haven't forgotten about this. I've been busy with school, but I have just graduated, so I'll have a lot of free time before I move to college to focus on these requests.

It's about six feet tall, humanoid and hunched over with abnormally long arms and hooked claws coming off of it's fingers. It's head is somewhere between a human and a cheetah, but with decidedly human ears. It is always grinning. It carries a large crooked knife, and it is skinned. It just has no skin on it.

~~*4. Keep it SFW.  I post these on my official [fb site] (http://facebook.com/emeldi.art) (""Like"" it today!) and then link them back here.  If you want something you wouldn't show to your mom, email me for a commission (michael (at) emeldi-art.com).~~

I'm not an artist, so could you guys could somehow create a drawing of a mixture between the two? I'd be eternally grateful if anyone even did just one of them at all; however, IF you were to do them in color, I'd like the following hair color (and possibly an extra detail) for each drawing. Here are the combos:  

Loki = Ariel: Loki's color hair, but Ariel's style. Also, if you could somehow replace Loki's scepter with a trident, that'd be great.  

Thor = Rapunzel: Obviously blond hair, but longer than Thor's. Also replace his hammer with a frying pan, please. 
 
Captain America = Cinderella: Blond, but with Captain America's hairstyle.  

Iron Man = Snow White: Iron Man's color hair.  

Black Widow = Merida: Even though they both have more ginger hair, the person to which we assigned them has a lighter reddish blond color.  

Hulk = ambiguous: We never had the chance to assign this Avenger a princess, so you can choose! No additional details needed.  

Finally, this is only choir member who has something other than a Disney Princess:  

Hawkeye = [Jack Frost](http://i.imgur.com/jLFk7.jpg) from Rise of the Guardians. No additional details needed.

I'm best at animals, people, fantasy creatures, etc. Fanart is always fun - I especially like mashups between series :) Ill start in about an hour and do as many as I can -wooooo.

Sorry, but no NSFW stuff.

Edit: By the way, if anyone wants any of these originals pm me, I'll send pretty much any of them to you for $5 (pretty much just to cover the time and cost of sending it) as long as you're in the US. If you're in Canada $6 is probably enough. The colors look a bit better irl since I was using a crappy cam. I have way too much art sitting around my place as it is, and it'd be a shame to toss them all. They're all on 8.5 x 11 sheets of regular paper.

I'm not sure what the boy and girl would be talking about. Probably reminiscing about a childhood together, or talking about things important to them. They are obviously not happy about the asteroid, but content that they get to spend time together before the end. They are not dating or married. They just enjoy each other's company.

I've had the same dream regularly since I was about 12 years old -19 now- where I'm driving in a car with my family and our car collides into this figure on a busy street. 

A man staggers out of the wreck and shoots us what is a some sort of scowl, grimace and terrifying cheesy grin. I can see that his face is horrifically scarred, but not from the accident. The scars are a mixture of old and new, from numerous time periods. I get a disgusting sense that they are the results of various attempts to tear at his own face. He dashes away from the crash, crawling and scurrying over the wreckage. 

The dream cuts to me in the garage inspecting the car. It's completely totaled. The bonnet is crushed like tin foil and all of the glass is shattered. There is no way that anything could have survived being hit like that. 

As I look on I hear this demonic chuckle. Somewhere between a witches cackle and a deep beastly roar. As I look to the source I see the figure in a painting on my wall. I am horror struck and cannot move. He begins to crawl towards me, out of the painting, clawing at the frame as he goes. At this stage I black out and awake in cold sweats. 

There are variations to the dream, sometimes I'm trapped in paintings with him, famous landscape works that I swear I've never seen before and then months later come across them for the first time in the waking world to my terror. 

The dreams have been getting worse lately, more frequent, more vivid. I would just love a physical manifestation to be able to see in the waking world.

Description: Short to average height with a very gaunt figure which hints and wiry strength. Poor, hunched forward posture. Horrifically scarred and thinning face with stringy, bonewhite with hints of yellow green hair. Full and foul mouthed intimidating grin. He's always appearing in a victorian era suit, with coat tails, top hat and a black, steel tipped cane. Because of the cane and his gaunt figure, I at some point began to call him ""The Pin Man"".

I went to a jeweler with a basic concept and they can do it and gave me a price and all that already.

This is the inspiration for the ring: view the Little Mermaid ring on the right...
http://imgur.com/IyW7PJo

I am pretty much making this type of ring but in the theme of The Lion King instead. My girlfriend loves this movie and is going to love this ring more than anything.

In place or Ariel, will be young simba. Instead of flounder (the fish), I would like to incorporate Zazu (the bird) but I'm not 100 percent sure it's possible yet..but would like to try and get him in there for the concept..

The diamond isn't going to have any fancy supports like that ring shown, it will just be a standard holster.

In place of the sea shells and whatever else is on that ring, I need some design elements..rocks or whatever is relavant.

**I am willing to give someone an hours pay to do this.
I will also show you the ring when it is done.**

Ring constraints must be kept in mind, but they don't have to be thought about too much because once I send the drawing along, they will tell me if they need to change anything for it to work. But the Little Mermaid ring is a solid example of what can be done and what I want done..minus the special diamond holder.

Once it is no longer a toy for him it would be a keepsake for my wife and I.  I sent a request in to Happy Softies (http://www.happysofties.com/), however they need the pic to be of cartoony nature.  Simple is probably better for them, but I would hope that the cartoon version is clearly recognizable as my son.  His key facial featurers are his big eyes, and the lack of smile.  He NEVER smiles in pictures, even if you catch him having fun playing the smile drops when he notices the camera, its very cute and I love it!  Anyways this would be a huge step towards getting this present done and I would be very much apreciative.  My only expertise is in asphalt paving, so unless you need advice/consulting on a parkinglot, I don't have much else to offer in return other than a paypal donation, which I  feel would be absolutely justified!

The rules:

*1. Keep it brief--if you can, explain the drawing in a single sentence.

*2. Link references of real people, places or pets. I can't draw your son stealing cookies if I don't have a picture.

*3. No licensed characters, please.

*4. Keep it SFW. I post these on my official fb site (""[Like](http://facebook.com/emeldi.art)"" it today!) and then link them back here. If you want something you wouldn't show to your parole officer, email me for a commission (michael (at) emeldi-art.com).

*5. If I drew for you last week, please leave room for people who have not yet had a drawing. If you really, really want another picture drawn, my commission rates are nice and cheap.  Send your request to michael (at) emeldi-art.com.

~~Other than that, go nuts! If you're stumped for ideas, see some of the past submissions [here](http://facebook.com/emeldi.art) (along with my other stuff). I'll draw requests in the order I receive them, and I'll keep going until my hand gets tired.~~

I know, there currently are a ton of offering threads open and I hope I won't steal a request from anyone, but this is the best point of time for me to start it.

While I still have a huge amount of things to learn, I will try at drawing whatever ideas you'll give me. If you want your drawing to be made in a specific style, it would be awesome if you'd tell me and/or provide me with an example image.

There is a little downside, though, and please be aware of it: **Your request will take time.**

I'm not in the USA or Canada, but rather in central Europe, so there'll be quite a bit of time difference (it's about midnight here now, for reference). As I'm a rather slow drawer, I might take half an hour to an hour for your request, so it will be accumulating. I'm sorry in advance!  
But, perhaps, if you are patient, give me a chance and I'll do my best. :D

EDIT: And that's it! Thank all of you who requested a picture from me. It was a nice experience, I had a blast (*and* was able to practise!) I wish all of you a happy, successful and fluffy new year or, as we'd say in my home country: Guten Rutsch ins neue Jahr!

A horse in full polo gear, on the saddle of a mighty stallion

A horse-drawn carriage, piloted by a horse

1) This process works best if you upload a high quality scan or photo of your drawing.

2) The results will be in [this](http://i.imgur.com/u98qo.png) style, so portraits and non-cartoony images might not turn out quite well.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION:
So I make short films for a hobby (as well as act) and I'm getting into preproduction on a new project right now. It's a science fiction film about these manned gun satellites that ring the Earth to protect the planet from alien objects that keep colliding with the earth whilst avoiding conventional defenses.
  
The story is about one character and the loneliness he endures as he staves off these inhuman and emotionless assaults. There's a lot more that goes into the story but I won't get into too much else.
  
ART CONCEPT  
So for the poster I wanted to show the earth in the background and the satellite (artists interpretation) in the foreground. All that I really need to be shown is some sort of firing device. I want to show how lonely it is for this guy to be working alone so far from Earth, while showing what he is working for.

GRATITUDE  
This poster would be used to drum up excitement for the project and would be posted across all of our social media platforms (reddit/facebook/twitter/official website) you would also be listed in the credits of the film as well as the IMDB (if you wish). I can't promise the project will blow up but I'm confident that it's going to be seen by a decent amount of people and probably wouldn't hurt if you are trying to get exposure.

TLDR- Short film about manned-weaponized satellite. Need poster (artists interpretation) depicting the Earth and the satellite at the same time. Good exposure, grateful crew.

1352612350.0,14,self.ICanDrawThat,12zyv8,[Request] I would like someone to help me visualize a hallucination of a demon I had during a recent episode of Sleep Paralysis,18,4,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/ICanDrawThat/comments/12zyv8/request_i_would_like_someone_to_help_me_visualize/,"Hey all,

I hope this is the appropriate place to post this. The demon may be fairly easy to draw for some of you, but I don't have the ability to make it myself. 

I've done a bit of research on Sleep Paralysis as I have roughly 5-6 episodes every time I try to sleep. It seems that there is a correlation between these demons and Sleep Paralysis and it would be great if someone could parse through the vague details below and help me recreate it as a reference. 

* I was sleeping on my back when this happened. I could see the demon was crouching above me at about waist level (kind of like [this](http://images2.fanpop.com/image/photos/9400000/neytiri-crouching-james-camerons-avatar-9473058-634-286.jpg)) and looking directly at me. 

* It's entire body was pitch black. I remember it being darker than anything I could imagine, it even stood out so vividly against my already dark room. This made it a little difficult to differentiate where it's body, arms, and legs crossed. 

* The body of this thing was thin. There was a slight inward curve like it was malnourished. The curves here were the only non-linear features of the entire creature. The arms and legs met at a point (I remember the knees being so sharp that I thought I would cut myself if I were to touch it). 

* There were these plates that came out of it's elbows and knees (I Googled elbow blades and [this](http://fc05.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2010/327/a/2/raphael_elbow_blade_by_young9tradition-d33gxyl.jpg) is the closest example I could find). These plates were straighter and thinner (as thin as the arms) than what is shown in the link and they were about as long as it's torso.

* It's fingers were about 6x longer than a normal human finger. The tips also came to a really sharp point. I remember at one point, the demon pressed his fingers on my torso and they pierced through my skin with little effort. 

* The face was very pointy as well. The chin came to a sharp point, and the eyes were piercing, red, and came to three points I believe. 

* The top of the arms and the head had smoke constantly floating upwards (the smoke was the same color as the body, so I couldn't determine the shape of the top of the head or the arms). The eyes had the same smoke effect, but they were emitting red instead of black. 

* I don't recall this thing having a mouth at all. If I remember that it did, or if I see it again, that is something I can have someone add later.

I hope this is enough detail to give you a rough idea of what I saw. If you need any more information, please let me know. I would really appreciate seeing this thing.

There are certain things I can and can't draw, and some things I'd like to work on more. So if your character is a bit too boring, I may choose not to draw it. On the flip side, if it is too complicated, it's likely I will pass over it as well.

I also need a reference picture since it is not impossible but slightly difficult to get your character right just from a description. I don't want to screw it up, y'know?

But if you need to add a little extra information to help me out, feel free to add a blurb about their personality/age/career/anything else you think would help me accurately draw them.

I don't want to show up at a shop with nothing to to go off of.
First off I'd like it to be a full lower sleeve done with black and grey line.
The idea behind it is from Disneys The Beauty and the Beast. More precisely that Beast wasn't able to get belles love before the last rose petal fell. And subsequently had to live with the notion that he was doomed to be the beast forever, living out his days as a creature he thinks that no one will ever love...
I'd like to see what someone would draw with that pretense in mind... In my head I see it as a graphic almost batman style comic book take on the beast. (Kind of similar to zombie princess' but without the gore and solid color) Maybe perched on a castle spire but of course I'm completely open to interpretation.
I can't do this myself and the only thing stopping me is a clear idea of what I would like to present to the artist.

I've just invited u/shittypaintings to be a moderator so if he accepts hopefully he can help things run more smoothly. I also might put up a meta post looking for an additional mod but I'm not sure yet.

Anyways, the winner of our last contest was u/the_disreputable_dog, who compiled art found on this subreddit from racheal1991, el_frou, teasprout, thediscobison, thomasatnip, moosehairunderwear, BaconPancakes1, Benkislap, Desc3000, xxcloolessxx, covertwalrus, ZombifiedRacoon and herself into [this great header!](http://i.imgur.com/Hfl5gUg.png)

**Contest #11:**

Rules:

* Picture must have dimensions **1024x105**

* Picture should include the subreddit name

* Nothing NSFW

Aside from that, you have artistic freedom. The most highly upvoted comment will be selected.

If you submitted your design in a previous contest you can resubmit it for a current one as long as you weren't the winner.

**Regarding contest length:**

I'm thinking it would be good to have each header run for 2 weeks.  1 week seems kinda short and a month seems too long.  We'll actually be on top of changing the headers from now on.

Was wondering if someone could draw my two furry little friends curled up together, taking a nap under the shade of a tree, maybe with a peaceful little stream on the other side of the tree.


Long story.... medium, my puppy, Taco, was a toy rat terrior, and was 11 years old when we met our cat, Odie. Odie was pretty old too (we later found out he was 12), and when he first came up to us, he was starved and beaten up. We nursed him back to full health, and the two old guys became friends. About 4 months later, Taco passed away, having given us more happiness than we deserved. Odie stuck around (he was an outdoor cat), and was a great, loving little friend. Two days ago, a neighbor had let his aggressive dog out to roam the streets (illegal where I love), and it killed my little Odie cat. It still hurts my heart a lot, but I try to imagine that Taco was there waiting for Odie cat when he passed over, the two friends reunited, healthy and young.


So, if anyone feels up to, could someone could draw my two furry little friends under the shade of a tree, maybe with a peaceful little stream on the other side of the tree, curled up together and taking a nap while they wait to be reunited with their buddy drewsephvladmir? 



It would truly mean the world to me.

His name is the same as mine (ObliviusMaximus) and he's a Goliath Warlock (Hexblade). The back story that i wrote for him may help with the design. Late one night many years ago, a child, ObliviusMaximus (or Max for short) was awaken from a deep slumber. He awoke to a man in robes at the foot of his bed. This man explained to Max that he had been chosen to become the living embodiment of the dark lord Asmodeous. The man explained that he was part of a cult that worshipped the dark lord and that he could teach Max the ways of the dark arcane magic. Max agreed to leave with him and train. Over the years, Max had become quite adept with the dark magic and the Blade of Annihilation but with each passing day, he began to resent the cult and everything they stood for. Late one night, Max slaughtered the members of the cult leaving only one to survive. A female human warlock name Ophilia (my companion character) who vowed to follow Max and help him in any way she could.

Executus Charborn stands at 6'2"" and 130 lbs. At 16, he was transformed from a human into a humanoid fire elemental by a mysterious magical artifact. His skin is mostly a light tone, but dried and charred by his elemental transformation. He is now 27 years old and served as a mercenary for several houses in the Last War. Roaring flames replace his formerly human hair, and small flames flicker from the corners of his deep black eyes. His face has an alien, elemental look to it, changed by the transformation. Executus wears a long, plain, flowing robe with hems charred from the blistering heat of his fiery form. In one had he wields a thick charred oak staff while the other hand conjures a small fireball as if charging an infernal spell.

While listening to this song, she described to me in vivid detail these visions that this song was giving to her that really sound quite beautiful, and I'd like to see if someone could make this into a work of art. My expectations are low, but it sounded intriguing to me, so I thought others might find it evocative as well. I describe the vision below in the same stream of consciousness that it was told to me:

* Time-travelling pirates.
* Flying through space on a pirate ship, but its a space ship that looks like a pirate ship.
* Space whales (if you do choose to draw this, maybe choose a whale other than Orca whales. My wife has some sort of strange fear of them based on Free Willy. I don't get it either.) flying, following these pirates.
* Pirates are not hunting the whales, but just travelling with them.
* Whales are colorful, a muted version of Lisa Frank, perhaps (her words, not mine).

Maybe there is a way to turn this into something beautiful. If someone is really passionate about this (not my expectation, but if), and the image is good, I may frame it for her as a gift for her birthday or Christmas. Otherwise, I just think it would be a beautiful surprise, since I doubt she will even remember this whole incident after today.

Name: Lord Vladimir Chang of Scotland

Race: Half Elf

Class: Fighter

Alliance: Chaotic Neutral

Back Story: Raised as royalty in Scotland by a Russian mother and a Chinese Father, Vlad was forced into the family trade of bag-piping. Being embarrassed, Vlad fled from home and got addicted to drugs. Found on the streets of Scotland, starving and poor, a passing war lord took him in. Little did Vlad know, his new owner planned on training and fighting Vlad in underground hand to hand fighting to the death. Devoting himself to his new trade, Vlad mastered hand to hand combat, gaining respect and fame to those who know the deadly sport. Vlad had enough of being his owners play toy, he managed to break free from his cell, kill his owner and run away from his own personal hell. Vlad now wanders the roads of the world in search of meaning in his life.

The current blends are listed here:

https://www.adagio.com/signature_blend/group.html?group=1289

If you are interested in drawing the art for any of these blends, please comment with which creatures you would like to draw (or send me an ask on tumblr, http://taelithium.tumblr.com/ask). Please choose at least 3 creatures you would be interested in drawing just in case your top choice gets chosen by someone else before I get a chance to see your message.

The art must be 700x437 pixels, preferably in PNG format. It should have the creature’s name large and visible as well as your name (you deserve credit for this!!). Whether or not you include the teas in the blend on the actual label is completely up to you. (Don't worry about whether your art is traditional or drawn on the computer! If you draw it on paper, feel free to scan it and send it to me!)

And once all the teas are done, I may just feel nice enough to send you a bag of the blend with your art on it so you can show it off!!!! :D
Make sure you add me as a friend and let me know which tea you drew so I know who to give gifts to!

CREATURES THAT ARE BEING DRAWN:

Siren

Mermaid

Faun

Send all finished art to necromanticize@gmx.com
OR- if you prefer, upload it to an image sharing site (like tinypic) and direct message me the link.

I came up with the idea that he should make a sweet smoking jacket and another redditor came up with the drawing idea from the title.

The reason we love this idea for an image (to go on his sweet smoking jacket) is because those four men, who were the first four presidents and prophets for the Mormon church all happened to smoke. (back in the day it wasn't against the rules to do so.) The Church tries to hush up anyone talking about any of their old prophets doing things like drinking or smoking that would come across as questionable or against the standards which they practice today. So the smoking jacket would be a good gift from the Exmo community for this poor fellow (because we like to try and help each other out a lot on Exmo), it brings up great questions from stereotypical mormons about it, and in general it would kind of be a bad ass shirt or jacket!

TL;DR A guy in provo is being shunned because he smokes. Design is for a smoking jacket for him and to make shirts for stereotypical ex-mormons to wear (because it would be kick ass!).

This is an idea I've had for a while. I've seen some of the amazing things you all can create and I hope that I'll get lucky with this! I'd love a very simplistic version of this, just the legs (you can make them look sketched if that's possible!) and the tree branches curving out of her waist. Feel free to get creative with the branches, but I'd really love something like [this](http://images.fineartamerica.com/images-medium-large/abstract-art-tree-fire-blossoms-by-madart-megan-duncanson.jpg).

If you use a program like Photoshop, export highest quality and upload to dropbox or i.minus.com to maintain the quality.

Thank you very, very much! I can't wait!

It's been haunting me.,8,0,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/ICanDrawThat/comments/18y07c/request_can_someone_recreate_this_beautiful_beach/,"I was on a beach that was utterly vast, stretching to the horizon in three directions. On the more inland part of the beach, there was a huge stretch of tidepools on a slope. They seemed to be made of lava or something, but each consisted of a ridge about five feet across holding shallow water, and they were just stacked on each other all the way up the slope. There was a large black cloud hanging over the tide pools, casting enough of a shadow that you could see the phosphorescent plankton in them glowing.
However, the cloud ended right at the end of the tidepools and the ocean and the strip of white sand between the ocean and the pools was soaked in bright yellow light from a clear afternoon sky. The water was bright blue and the waves were massive, but somehow benevolent. I knew it would be possible at any time for one of them to engulf the entire beach where I was sitting and wash me out to sea.",,False,,t5_2sqsz,False,,,True,t3_18y07c,http://www.reddit.com/r/ICanDrawThat/comments/18y07c/request_can_someone_recreate_this_beautiful_beach/,

Hi I need this logo drawn by someone better than me. The 3 things are ofcourse out of scale but i'm looking for the logo to look good that way.
The book should read: Selfsuficiency with, #1 below. The shovel is an italian shovel - you can google that to see how it looks. The logo is for my webshop that i'm building. The name of my shop is: SelvforsyningsCentralen (danish). So if you could include that someway or separately it would be great. I'm willing to donate small fee if we can agree on something and i like your idea. 

Thank you. 

PS. And i'm still looking for it to do well as a logo on website. Could be something like this... http://imgur.com/l4zFdXP I'm open to suggestion/advice.
