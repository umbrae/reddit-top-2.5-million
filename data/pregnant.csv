1346076758.0,33,self.pregnant,ywjo2,"My Birth Story: or, How I Fired My OBGYN at 39 Weeks Pregnant, And Lived To Tell The Tale. ",52,19,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/ywjo2/my_birth_story_or_how_i_fired_my_obgyn_at_39/,"This birth story actually started with a different birth three years ago, when I had my first child. 

I was, as most first-time moms are, quite naive back then. I was much too trusting of the authority of doctors - *any* doctor. I followed every instruction to a T, blindly, without looking anything up or consulting other experts. I signed up with the OBGYN that my primary care physician recommended, and never asked any questions about anything, simply assuming that everyone naturally had MY best interests at heart in addition to the baby's. 

They didn't, really. 

The doctors turned out to be shitty ones. Looking back it seems to me they did everything in their power to make sure I had a very medicated, intervention-heavy birth. And they forced me to have a MILLION internal exams. (I know this isn't a big deal *objectively*, but to me, this is huge. Internal exams really freak me out, I start shaking at even the mention of one. I was sobbing hysterically through all the medically unnecessary internal exams they did on me. I had no idea I could say no to the exams!) By almost every metric it was a perfectly fine birth with only a few small complications (pitocin-induced labor, vacuum assisted birth, the 4th degree tear requiring 18 stitches that thankfully healed quickly, some hemhorraging was fixed with a blood transfusion later that night), but the whole event left me feeling like utter shit: pressured, patronized, dissed from all the negative talk directed at me, and more than a little violated. 

The funny thing is I didn't even realize how much I had hated the experience. At the time, and for a long while after, I just felt incredibly lucky - I believed everything the doctors had told me, and thought that they were just an awesome bunch of people to have dealt with a ""challenging patient"" like me so well. So when I got pregnant this time, *I signed up with the same OBGYNs again*. 

Their pressure tactics started again, from day 1: the ""strong recommendation"" to just schedule a c-section and be done with it, the dire warnings about how big my baby was getting and how they would need to induce at week 38 (which is very wtf because I am at a healthy weight, and I gained only 14lbs my first pregnancy, lost it all, and gained 9lbs this time, so I wasn't by any means very big!), etc etc etc. I felt depressed, pressured, like an ""ordeal"" was starting yet again, but somehow never thought of switching doctors.

Anyway, by the time week 35 had rolled around I was starting to make a birth plan. This time, I had read up quite a lot from independent sources on the whole birth process. I knew that I'd been lied to the last time (they said they HAD to perform all those millions of internal exams), and I knew I would have to be very firm and very assertive this time around if I was going to have the birth experience that I wanted - as natural as possible. 

So I sat down with my husband and together we made the plan. I feel like I should scan those pages and post them here just so you can look at them: it reads like we were preparing for war. According to the plan, my husband was to be the ""guardian lion"" of the birthing room. It was his job to turn away doctors and nurses at the door while I was laboring, to tell them not to offer me drugs, to stop them from doing medically unnecessary tests and exams, to enforce the ""no internal exams"" rule, and so on and so forth. Practically every bullet point could be categorized under ""HOW TO STOP THE DOCTORS AND NURSES FROM DOING MEDICALLY UNNECESSARY SHIT TO ME"". 

This should have been a big fucking clue I had chosen the wrong doctors, but noooooooooo. I was convinced that what happened last time was MY fault, that if I was assertive enough then they would hear me and let me be. 

Then came the fateful 39th week appointment. The RN I was meeting that day walked in, and her opening words were ""So we need to talk about inducing you right about now."" 

""I don't want to be induced unless it is medically necessary,"" I told her firmly. 

""Well, you tore really badly the last time around, that's why we are concerned. It's better if you give birth when the baby's a little smaller,"" she said.

I wasn't having any of it. ""Well, I did heal fine last time. I don't want to be induced until I'm 42 weeks. I really hated laboring on pitocin, you know, it was ridiculously painful.""

""Well, haha, that's labor for you!"" she said.

I was relieved that she hadn't continued pressuring me. But then she started again. 

""So we need to do an internal exam this week,"" she told me, pulling on gloves already.

My heartbeat went into overdrive. ""I'm sorry, I don't want internal exams. It's my one big fear, just thinking of it makes me shake. It's not medically necessary, right?""

""Well, what if you're 5 cm dilated and walking around, without even knowing it?"" she said.

I was genuinely confused. ""Well, what if I am?"" 

""Well, you could drive home and then 20 minutes later give birth!""

I blinked. ""But ... that would be *awesome*. That's my DREAM birth scenario!""

She looked at me in that kind-but-patronizing way that doctors sometimes do when they think your IQ is hovering at about 50 today. ""But aren't you worried there might be complications? What if something goes wrong, fifthredditincarnati? Your baby might die.""

I laughed. There was nothing else I could do. I couldn't believe she was threatening me with DEAD BABY for refusing a tiny little internal exam! ""Um, I don't think that's very likely, so I'm not worried.""

Her tone became very stern. ""So that's a risk you're willing to take, then.""

""Sure. Just like I could die on my way home now in a car crash, right?"" 

""You're willing to risk your baby dying,"" she repeated in that same stern tone.

""My baby *isn't* going to *die*, and I take bigger risks every day,"" I told her, and this time I let my irritation show in my voice. 

""That's a real shame,"" she said and left the room without waiting for my response. 



All along the drive home I was seething... and by the time I came home I was just stoking my anger to keep from crying. Crying from what? I don't even know. I was angry, but also just flabbergasted and frustrated and ... *disappointed*. I had honestly thought that if I was assertive about communicating my birth preferences, my doctors would listen to me. But instead, here I had had to put up such a ginormous fight just to refuse an internal exam! I was so pissed off with myself for choosing these doctors again. 

The minute I got home, I had a plan. I called my insurance - they said I could switch OBGYNs anytime I wanted with only a small one-time extra copay. HALLELUJAH. 

Now for the harder part: research. I live in a medium-sized town, not a big city. My options for hospitals were limited to 4 or 5, one of which was already ruled out because I didn't want to go back to the same hospital as last time either: the on-duty nurses and doctors make a huge difference to how the birth occurs and I knew the culture at my old hospital was very intervention-oriented. 

So I looked online to see if there were any stats on the rate of interventions in the area hospitals. I found a report dated just two months ago in my local newspaper. HALLELUJAH yet again!

I picked the hospital with the lowest intervention rate and searched for articles and/or reviews of it online. There weren't any reviews, but again I lucked out - the local newspaper mentioned in another recent article that this hospital was known to be the most supportive one in the area of natural childbirth - *half* of all their nurses were midwives! 

Then the clincher - my first child's truly awesome pediatrician was attached to the same hospital. If I picked this hospital I wouldn't have to see all new doctors, since there was a Certified Nurse-Midwife OBGYN at that same pediatrician's office, one whom I had met before. 

I took it as a sign. I called the new doctors and booked an appointment ASAP. I called my old doctors, had them fax my records over, and fired them over the phone, saying what a shame it was that they had been so unprofessional. I called my old hospital and cancelled my pre-registration. I had my husband fax over my records to the new doctors and the new hospital. I was a *whirlwind* of problem-solving efficiency!

Two days later at my appointment, I was very anxious. An attack of last-minute nerves, you know? I was terrified that these new doctors would also turn out to be horrible. 

Then my OBGYN walked in, and said: ""Do you want an internal exam today?""

""NO!"" I was practically yelling at her. 

""Good,"" she said. ""I prefer not to do that, but sometimes people are curious about how effaced or dilated they are. Internal exams are really quite unnecessary.""

I could have *cried* in relief.  :-)

iPhone/iPod Touch/Droids have free seismometer apps meant for tracking earthquakes. One day when comparing my belly's wiggles to an earthquake it hit me.... I could use an earthquake app to track all those wriggles and kicks!

It works best later in the pregnancy when the kicks and wriggles make your belly jiggle and jump.... Just turn on the app, lay it on your belly over the spot you are getting the most action from, and watch as the stronger kicks make the graph spike. 

It's pretty cool to see the spikes get bigger as baby gets stronger.

A few very disgusting condescending bigoted jerkwad males chased away a pregnant woman looking for help and support in a time of desperate need. It was all in flagrant violation of the sidebar standards, specifically the part that says:

&gt; No judging people for being pregnant. Any post that insinuates anybody is too young, too poor, too single, too manly, too gay, too *whatever* to be pregnant will be deleted.

First: my apologies. I should have been around more to mod this subreddit more frequently than once every few days. I am planning to correct this problem by getting more moderators on board. Any volunteers? Please say yea in the comments. Moderation is only open to people who are pregnant, have been pregnant, or want to be pregnant (physically themselves, not a partner), and are fully willing to enforce standards set forth in the sidebar.

Second: there were good people in that thread who saw the jerkwads for jerkwads and called them out and yelled at them. This is good! But the mod team would also appreciate a quick heads-up that a jerkwad is currently jerkwadding in a thread. **You can help us out by clicking on the ""report"" button you see under every comment. Don't worry about overreporting. The mods look at every reported comment, approve the good/harmless and only remove the actively bigoted ones. WHEN IN DOUBT, HIT REPORT.** 

Third: My heartfelt apologies to the OP of that thread, and to every other person on this subreddit who has read that, or something like that, and been made to feel the brunt of common social prejudices here on this subreddit. This subreddit strives to be a better place. Hopefully with more moderators watching out and more users reporting shitty comments, we can get better soon.

I hate the term ""we're pregnant"", as if he's pregnant too, but now I see what people say that.  Sounds more like you're doing it together, which we are, I guess.  At least he's going to watch me be pregnant and says he's going to ""take care"" of me.  I'm not even sure what that means yet.  I don't have any children.  I'm 30 years old and have been dying to be a mother for over 5 years.  When I met Cody I knew he was the one right away.

I called my mother to tell her the good news and she wasn't UNsupportive, but she wasn't exactly supportive either.  She just said ""Well, I think you should get married now.  I think you should've gotten married first.""  Well, I agree.  We should've gotten married first.  That's what I wanted but this is how it happened and that wasn't exactly what I wanted to hear.  The really funny thing is that she got married before having kids and it didn't do her much good, but I digress, I do wish we were married before this but whatever.

So now we're planning a bit of a shotgun wedding.  Cody is really happy and so am I.  The awkward thing is that we just recently separated for the first time.  About 6 months ago I asked him to move out and started seeing other people.  I thought it had been 5 years and we weren't headed towards marriage and may be I needed to move on but we just ended up seeing each other anyways.  Now he's moving back in asap and I'm planning a wedding at the same time I'm planning for the baby.

And I have no clue what to expect.  The funny thing is that I'm actually a medical assistant by trade and work at an OB-GYN clinic.  Why do I feel like I know nothing all of a sudden though?  And I'm not going to lie quitting alcohol will be a minor challenge (I'm not a heavy drinker but it's nice to have a glass of wine when I get home from work) but quitting smoking pot is going to be a challenge.  It's my one crutch.  And while I don't intend on SMOKING pot I thoroughly intend on eating any special treats that come my way and I am not going to feel guilty about that.  Okay okay, I wouldn't've even said that if I didn't feel at least a little guilty about it, may be I wont.  I don't know.

I have to clean the house obsessively and go drink a ton of water and look at myself making fake pregnant belly in the mirror now.

Thanks for being an outlet.

Edit: Cody has now decided to freak out, insist I get an abortion even if that means I'll never see or speak to him again and is in general acting like a raging asshole.  My mother, on the other hand, has come around and is being supportive and is even coming up to visit.  She says he's just freaking out and he'll come around but he's said some really hurtful things.  He's saying that I did this on purpose!

A little bit of back story?  He found a lump on his balls a few weeks ago and suddenly he started talking about trying to have a baby, half jokingly.  I had never heard him talk that way.  To be honest, after 5 years of unprotected sex and only using the rhythm method and no close calls?  I think we both thought he was impotent.  So we both gave it a shot.  He asked me when I was ovulating and everything.  I mean, we PLANNED sex!  I told him I was ovulating and he was THERE!  Now he's saying that never happened and that I manipulated him?  WTF?!  I TOLD him I was ovulating and he came in me!  How is that manipulation?!  It's not like I lied and told him I wasn't ovulating and it was safe!

So, I'm very hurt right now but I think we are patching things up.  He's on his way over and we are going to try to make up and have a ""normal"" night and not talk about baby stuff or marriage stuff and just have a nice mellow night together like we used to a week ago...

I just found out how far along I am, which came as a huge shock to my boyfriend and I, both still being in college and living about an hour and a half away from each other. With this recent discovery we've decided to find a family to adopt the baby, but at the same time I have to withdraw from my classes this quarter and move back home near my boyfriend until I have the baby. 

Up until now we thought we were going to abort the baby, not realizing that I was so far into the pregnancy. I never had any morning sickness or other typical symptoms and the occasional spotting matched up with my menstrual cycle, which is why we made this discovery so late. Unfortunately because of not knowing, I have not been taking care of my body the way I should have been. As a college student I do frequent the party scene, drinking a few times this school year, in addition to many occasions over the summer. I also have not been watching what I eat and I fear that this will result in either defects with  the baby or complications in the birthing process in general, which brings me to the final part...

I'm terrified of giving birth. As someone still in their teen years, the thought of having a baby never crossed my mind. All I can associate with the whole process is pain, which I have a low tolerance for, coupled with the fact that after this whole process the baby will be going home to a different family. While it will be difficult to give up the baby, I am thinking that since I have not felt this ""bond"" with the baby, it might not affect me as much as I may think. 

I do have a few questions to ask though:

What can I do to keep the baby healthy for the last few weeks of this pregnancy?

For anyone who has given up a baby for adoption, how did you cope and did it take long for you to get over it?

Because of my unhealthy lifestyle for the majority of the pregnancy, am I or the baby at risk for complications during the pregnancy?

Any other advice from similar experiences would also be greatly appreciated, it's an understatement to say that I'm afraid for what will happen.

*Edit: I would like to add that as of right now, my only support for this is coming from my boyfriend. I have not told my roommates or any of my other friends and I'm not sure who to tell at this point because I'm afraid of any judgement, so I am trying to keep this pregnancy unknown to others.",,False,,t5_2qwzb,1353403461.0,,,True,t3_13i34v,http://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/13i34v/34_weeks_and_freaking_out/,

When I finally got off of the bus from work, and saw my car, the cold wet wind hit me. I ran to the car at full speed. I tripped up, and face/belly planted, hard, on the asphalt of the car park. I picked my self up got in the car and turned on the heat. My lower abdomen hurt, so I called the OB's office to see if I should come in. They said it wouldn't hurt to go to the ER, just in case. If I didn't have any bleeding or cramping everything was probably okay, and it would be more for my piece of mind, but totes okay with them. However! Since I am not yet 20 weeks, I will most likely be seen in the ER and not L&amp;D.

That was fine, I drove to the ER told triage why I was there, I asked the guys at triage where the toilet was, and then they asked me to pee in a cup instead. Before he could even ask or tell me, I asked if they wanted a normal one or sterile. This is a sure sign that I pee in cups too often. 

I got comfortable. I waited for a long time in the waiting room. But when I finally got a room in the ER the nurse was super sweet, and got the doppler right way. She told me she doesn't get the chance to do these often, and that she is an ER nurse, so if she couldn't find the baby's heart beat right away, not to freak out. She actually found it pretty quickly which was a relief. I think the baby might have been a sleep. Durring the last doppler at the OB I got to hear the heart beat for like 2 seconds before the baby moved out of the way!

I then got to put on the gown... get under some blankets and wait. I took a long (3-4 hour) nap. It was Friday night, after bar close in the ER. I can't be mad at them, I wasn't in any pain, and I wasn't bleeding. The Dr had the portable ultra sound with him! He wanted to give it ago to save me from having to wait to go down to imaging! So I got all full of jelly, and he started. Then I saw little legs... kicking at the damn ultrasound wand, and started laughing.

I got to see the heart actually beating... this is the first time I've gotten the chance to see what is going on in there, and it was amazing!",,False,,t5_2qwzb,False,,,True,t3_10c2b9,http://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/10c2b9/i_had_a_bit_of_a_fall/,

1363624837.0,10,self.pregnant,1aj5nh,Birth story time!,13,3,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1aj5nh/birth_story_time/,"This is going to be kind of long.

Our little dude was due on February 19th, that day came and went with nothing going on. I was 2cm dilated, no effacment and he was still -2 station. So I decided to give him another week, and scheduled an induction for he 27th of February. For most of the pregnancy he had been frank breech, and flipped over the day before I went in for a scheduled manual version. I figured if I scheduled the induction he might just decide to come out on his own. I was so wrong.

We went to a diner to get breakfast, once I got to the hospital I knew I wasn't going to be allowed any food, and we got to the hospital a little before 7AM. By 7:30 I was hooked up to the IVs and monitors and the nurse had done her exhaustive check in questions. I stressed to her how important it was to me that I remain as mobile as possible during the labour. It seriously helps me deal with pain to be able to move through it. She seemed okay with this... but it was before 10AM before I was able to get on the mobile monitors and walk around L&amp;D. The nurse wasn't so happy about this because my walking made the baby hard to trace on the monitors. I was confused by this because my OB had told me that I'd only need to be monitored 20 minutes out of every hour, even with being induced.

Sometime around noon the on call OB came in to check my progress, 3.5cm and 70% effaced! She tried to break my water, and it didn't immediately take. I continued to do pelvic tilts and swaying my hips to try to get baby to come down more. Before the first nurse left my pitocin was up to a 16, and my contractions had no real pattern to them. It was actually like one huge contraction that sucked a little less for some of the time. 

When the new nurse came in at 2PM I asked if it was okay for me to take a nice hot bath, since my water hadn't actually broken yet and the pain was starting to get more intense... she said no and made a joke about how if I was in labor naturally at this point and came in they'd still send me home. 

This new nurse wasn't keen on me walking around L&amp;D either, so I paced around my bed and used it to lean on when the contractions got bad. I got really good at repositioning the monitors to find baby again when I moved around. It was like she wanted me to stay in bed or in the rocking chair during the most painful part of the contractions to make her job easier. While rocking my water finally breaks.

The next shift change came (maybe around 7PM?), and I had just sat down after a contraction. In bounds this little woman with black hair, she immediately asks me what I have been doing to help progress my labour. My mom and I look at each other and start listing off all the things we've tried. The nurse, Jackie, smiles and tells me her own labour stories and helps me try a few new positions. She checks how I am progressing, 4cm 80% effaced and -1 station! She turned my pitocin down to an 8 (from a 16) to try and get my contractions into some sort of pattern.  We talk a little bit about pain management and tells me that she is totally okay with whatever I feel that I need, but she won't suggest anything, and prefer that if I feel like I need it I should ask her. I told her that was awesome and that was in my birth plan... which I left at home. We talked and she thought the baby was maybe sunny side up, and that's why he wasn't progressing. She also explained some things, like sitting ""bolt up right"" wouldn't help him come down if he was. So we tried some new side laying positions to try to use my own weight to get him to turn.

Jackie stayed with me for her entire shift, adjusting the monitors every time I moved so I could be comfortable and she could get a good trace of babies heart. She was freaking amazing! She did a cervical check before she left at around midnight. It was the most painful one I had had, and afterwards I did ask for pain meds so I could try and sleep. 

The new over night nurses came in, and we chatted for a bit. I woke up every 2 hours or so to pee and talked to the awesome nurse while she helped me out of bed and everything. I would get into bed and get into the side lay position with my leg up again, get a little more pain med and fall back a sleep. At 6AM I told her I wanted to try and sleep for another hour  or two and then get out of bed and get moving again. After I got up and peed, she gave me a cervical check, 5cm 100% effaced and 0 station, awesome nurse told me that it was time for her to go and wished me luck. I fell back a sleep.

When I got up at 7... the morning nurse from the morning before was in the room, upping my Pitocin and telling me I needed to get out of bed so I could pee... and that I needed to sit in the rocking chair, or in bed for an hour to monitor the baby. I tried to tell her that I had just peed less than an hour ago, and it was really fine. I told her that I wanted to avoid sitting bolt up right because of what the night nurses had said. She told me no that sitting up right was a fine way to labour. I asked her when I was due for more pain medication, and she told me that they normally only let people have pain meds twice, so I was already over what I could have. But... I could have more at 8:30. Also she didn't see why I didn't just take the epidural already. This didn't make any sense to me and I started crying and went and sat on the toilet. It took me 5 minutes to relax enough to pee.  When I came out of the toilet I asked her to just please leave the room so I could labour in peace because she wasn't helping the situation at all. 

This is where things really start to get more blurry. After a few more hours my pitocin was back up to a 16, and the contractions where no longer a nice pattern like they had been over night. I caved and finally asked for the epidural. I couldn't feel the contractions any more, but I could still move my legs (I flipped my self over when it was time to every hour) most of this day was spent sleeping and ignoring the nurse that I didn't like. I was trying to get my legs into the side lay position that Jackie had shown me, since I had to be in bed anyways, but it was hard to do when the nurse wasn't interested in helping really. 

At some point awesome nurse Jackie came back and told me I was still at 5cm. Damnit. She asked if I wanted to try and do pelvic tilts and stuff while I was in bed to see if it got anything going. My OB came in and checked to see how I was feeling/progressing and checked on baby. His heart tones where getting a bit weird. We talked about c section and I asked for some more time to try to get baby to move down on his own. 
I tried pelvic tilts, and hip swaying and everything I could do. I tried for a final two hours and still had zero progress.

I said screw it and told my OB I was fine with the section at this point. The OR team swooped in, and I asked my OB if my Mom and my partner could be in the OR with me. He told me to ask the anaesthetist. When I asked her one of the OR nurses snapped at me that only one person could be in there with me... but the anaesthetist was like ""no it's cool they can both come with you"" 

They got me ready pretty quickly and changed the meds in my epidural. I could still move my toes, and my legs. My OB got me ready and did a ""pinch test"" to make sure the spinal took. I felt this, really sharply - to the point that I actually screamed ""FUCK!"" at my OB. They tried  it again, but still it didn't take. They put me under. I woke up a few hours later being wheeled from labour and delivery to the postpartum department. I remember being shown the baby in the hall way, and hitting the ""new baby button"" which plays a nursery rhyme through out the hospital every time a baby is born.

My partner and I never talked about how we would announce a name if I had to be put under, and we had a few different choices picked out. Sooo no one knew what the baby was called until I was awake enough to talk to my partner.

I hate hate hate to complain. However, being that the past six days have been so encompassed with misery that I needed a pen and paper to organize my list of agonies I thought I better document this in case my husband ever tries to impregnate me again.  Normally I would just go about my day and try not to think about all the things ailing me, but what the hell. Why not get it all out. Just a warning I have no filter at this point so if you have a weak stomach you probably shouldn't read this. First of all, I suffer from hyperemesis Gravidarum (which basically means you puke your brains out for the length of your pregnancy, and even when your  not puking you feel like you have to) I am also suffering from Gastroesophageal reflux disease which my doc swears I have had all my life, which blows my mind cuz I think I would remember constantly throwing up in my mouth. But anyways. These are problems that I had much more severe with my 1st pregnancy and now 27 weeks with my second, I have it down to an art how not to throw up. I have even gained 14 pounds. (I was at neg 20 pounds at this point with my first). Now I have a cold/flu from hell that is causing me to have trouble breathing and now I'm not just throwing up food and liquid into my mouth but mixing it with a delicious blend of mucous. I have had this cold for six days now and have had insane headaches body aches and congestion. Luckily no fever. These cold/flu symptoms normally wouldn't phase me much, but add it on top of constant nausea, a hemeroid that my husband swears is an alien protruding from my asshole, a yeast infection that literally is making me want to chop my vagina off and put it in a blender cuz it itches so bad, and constant heartburn followed by burning throw up in my mouth and its enough to make anyone lose it. So I have decided instead of crying which will do no good at all but congest me further.  I will laugh at the insane agony that I am in. It sucks but at the end of the day it is more than worth it.

1347286356.0,7,self.pregnant,zniup,Excited to see this sub! I'm a first time mom to a 7 week old. Here's my pregnancy and birth story (and pics).,17,10,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/zniup/excited_to_see_this_sub_im_a_first_time_mom_to_a/,"I'll try to make this brief and then I can expand in the comments if anyone has questions :)

I found out I was pregnant last December at around 6 weeks. We had been trying for 6 months. I was terrified and it wasn't until my ultrasound at 21 weeks that I truly believed there was a baby growing in me!

First trimester I was super tired and horny. Second trimester I was much more energetic. Third trimester I was back to being sleepy, I was awake for work and then for maybe 2 hours on top of that.

Throughout the pregnancy I suffered from SPD and SI joint pain. I craved fruit and had aversions to practically everything but mainly rosemary, sushi and lettuce.

I didn't go into labour naturally. Two days before I was due to finish work my water broke early in the morning. It gushed for 12 hours and I was induced with ocytocin. I was in labour for 19 hours.

I took forever to progress, I was at 2 cm for ages. I took morphine for the pain which helped but made me nauseated. Once I finally reached 3 cm they gave me the epidural. The first time I still had feeling in one side, so they had to redo it. Once it was working I progressed really quickly and soon it was time to push!

I pushed for an hour with my mom and husband supporting me before my little Colin was born :) he was 7lbs 5oz.

I had a 2nd degree tear. I'm only just starting to feel back to normal now, and I might try sex this week yay!

Colin had jaundice, so we had to stay in the hospital for a week so he could get light therapy. He also had a minor shoulder injury from delivery that healed on its own after a couple weeks. He also had a skin tag on his ear so they checked his hearing but he has no troubles there.

Since bringing him home it has been very challenging. I don't get much sleep. Breastfeeding is not working out for me. I've had challenges from the beginning and I'm about ready to give up. I love giving him the bottle too, he looks up at me and it's so sweet, an that way daddy can feed him too.

Oh, also I cloth diaper. I think I hit all the major points there!

Just recently found out that I am pregnant with my first last week. I am a little past 5 weeks. Exciting? Hells yeah! I'm 29 &amp;amp;amp; have been with the same man for the past 8 or so years with a few breaks in between. He is 41, has a child but no contact with him or his ex. 

So, to get on with my question. 
My SO is a drinker and somedays it can get out of control. I have asked him when he was sober to keep his mouth shut about me being pregnant because it is tooooo early to start telling acquaintances. Right now, only close family members know. 
Tonight, a few if his friends came over and I looked him in the face and said 'do not tell so and so because they have a BIG mouth. you need to promise me. I know you are happy, I am very happy but please, wait until at least September to tell anyone' 

He nodded and agreed with me. 

Then, he's loaded, and says to his friends. 'well, I think you guys should say congrats to me' my face turned and I let him have it right there. I knew it was going to come out of his mouth. I know it's a 'slip up' but geez!! (we live in a small town. 2500 people small) and his friend has the hugest mouth. 

I am quite aggravated with him. To the point that I wrote him a quick note saying not to tell anyone else. 

Did I overreact? I feel like I did. But then again, it's my first pregnancy and anything can happen. I hope it won't but I can't stop that. 

Thank you for reading! I have horrible grammar :/ Sorry. 
Take Care!

**b** Edit; I appreciate everyone taking time to comment :-) He read the note I left him, was a little upset but he understood. 
He was a little put off because I didn't talk to him face to face today. I really didn't give two sh**s if he was. He needed to know.

On Monday I went to urgent care to see about the numbness I have been having in my hands, and wrist pain. The medical assistant took my blood pressure in my forearm (what is this?). When I finally saw a doctor she put the fear of god into me about pre-E. Because my blood pressure came back super high. She tells me her nurse will re take it, and they are going to check my pee for protein but, if it is still high that she will be sending me to the ER. Then she did all the carpal tunnel confirmation testing, and by the second one I was in so much pain I was bawling. The stress of her talking about pre-e didn't help matters I am sure. 

A little later her nurse comes in to take my blood pressure, the normal way, and everything was bloody perfect. I got sent home with two huge wrist/forearm braces.

I went to the hospital because I was having hot flashes and thought, 'gee, I should finally take care of this. It's probably a hormone imbalance or something.' 
So when the doctor takes out the ultrasound machine, no biggie, there's probably a cyst on my uterus. Well I nearly fainted when he showed me the far and well developed fetus. I had had no symptoms! I had gained a little weight, even made a post in the fitness subreddit a few months ago (I'm 5'10"", and a week ago when I found out was 160 lbs) but pregnancy had never crossed my mind. 

I had a visit to my doctor a few days ago, but just to make sure it was alive and send me to get an ultrasound that can actually tell me things (I know I'm 28 weeks because that's the only possibility). The ultrasound isn't for another few days. I have done a total 180 on my diet. Lots of fruits, veggies protein and calcium. I'm staying with my mom until I have a chance to tell the rest of the family (cute story, I called my sister from the hospital and she said to come visit her for the weekend, when I get there, turns out she is pregnant too! All our family will be in town next weekend so we are telling everyone about it then.) 

My mom had 6 children and is making it her job to keep me healthy. She just took my blood sugar and is quite worried. It came back as 3.9 and she says that is too low. I eat every two hours without fail, just a decent snack, like apples and cheese or popcorn and a protein shake or veggies and dip or a sandwich. Does anyone know whether this is normal?

I'm currently 37 weeks and I've been trying to figure this out myself for the last 17 weeks, but it's very confusing to me.  Any advice on the matter would be great!

I got pregnant back in February from a fling I had with a friend of mine. When I told him about the pregnancy, he made it very clear that he didn't want to be the father due to some family issues and I, being a first-time mother, was very forgiving of that. I'm not going to attack him for child support because that's way more of a hassle than I need right now (plus a lot of other reasons that I'd rather not discuss) unless he wanted to participate in her life as the acting father. Another thing to note is that there's a little bit of doubt as to if it really is his because I was living with a really awful and abusive person who tried to kill me and may have raped me. However, we can't be sure because I have lacunar amnesia about the matter and don't really remember anything much.

Currently, I'm in a relationship with another man and I love him to pieces. I've been pregnant the entire time we've been together (though we didn't find out until two months into our relationship) and we both very much consider him the father. At first, we were thinking that he would adopt her so he would have all legal rights to her, which seemed like a very good move. However, after thinking about it some more, I was wondering if he could just sign the birth certificate. We were thinking I would leave it blank at first, and then he would adopt her afterward, but is it possible to skip the process?

Essentially tl;dr: Is it possible to have my current SO sign the birth certificate in place of the biological father (who won't be around), or would it be better to leave the father blank and then go through the adoption process? I live in Colorado if that makes a difference.

My insurance 'assigns' me my OB and I'm just stuck with him.  Anyhow... that out of the way...

I've been suffering scarily low blood pressure - where I'm just shy of passing out and his advice was to exercise in a 'safe' place (such as in front of my couch or in the bedroom next to my bed so if I suddenly feel a 'swoon' I can just sit immediately and not fall) when I start to feel dizzy to help up my blood pressure and to eat more salt.  But to watch it closely so I don't swing suddenly in the other direction which is more common.  

Because of my weight they've been continually worried about possible diabetes and pre-eclampsia, but so far I've been the complete opposite of both.  Low blood sugar and low blood pressure.  You'd think this was a good thing except that I kind of want to remain conscious and not fall and hit something vital.  

I've added a lot of spinach to my diet and make sure to take a high iron pre-natal (even though I'm not anemic) just to support blood cell growth.  I don't want to gain 100lbs while pregnant so I've avoided simply adding potato chips but I'm close to giving up on that if it means I won't have to suffer through this weird nausea, difficulty breathing and shaky legs that I get when my blood pressure drops unexpectedly.  

Anyhow, anyone have any suggestions for making my blood pressure rise - in a healthy way?  The internet was useless as all the sites are about lowering blood pressure.  My love says I'm just too relaxed all the time and I need more stress in my life.  I should start calling all those cousins and relatives I don't like.  

Edit:  I accidentally a word.

Edit 2:  **UPDATE** - I informed my pregnancy yoga instructor because I never knew exactly when I was going to have an episode and just wanted her to know it might happen during class.  She asked me if I felt short of breath prior to the syncope.  I said yes.  Without telling me why, she said if I ever felt that way to throw my arms straight up and do some concentrated breathing.  Preferably while standing and leaning against a wall or with a slight arch to my back.  If I started to get light headed of course I should sit or lie down and put my feet up.  I tried this the next three times it happened and I never went beyond shortness of breath.  Yesterday I e-mailed her to tell her it had worked.  She said she suffered the same thing while she was pregnant and it had everything to do with low O2 sats and nothing at all to do with salt so it was worth a try on me, but she wasn't a doctor so she couldn't just diagnose me with low oxygen.  My baby sits very high and while it should have taken a few more weeks, it already pushes on my diaphragm.  Throwing my arms up allows my lungs to expand and then I get enough oxygen.  Low oxygen can sometimes lead to syncope.  ",,False,,t5_2qwzb,1349708787.0,,,True,t3_10tls7,http://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/10tls7/syncope_and_low_blood_pressure_ob_is_being_less/,

I am currently 12 weeks along.  I have been on Zoloft 100mg for the past 2 years for depression and severe Anxiety and Panic attacks.  When I got pregnant, I tapered down slowly to 50mg with the intention of going completely off at 20 weeks.  By the time I had tapered down to 25mg though, I was a complete basket case.  The anxiety got so bad again that I could not function at work or eat properly and I began having unhealthy thoughts.  I went back up to 50mg, which does not completely get rid of the anxiety but does take the edge off and keeps the depression at bay.  I have spoken to a Parinatologist, PCP, OB and genetic counciler about Zoloft usage and all agree that if the benefits outweigh the risks, I should stay on it.  I have also done hours, and hours, and hours, of research on studies done around the world on Zoloft usage during pregnancy.  I am aware of the 3-6% higher rate of PPHN cases and Neonatal withdrawl syndrome that has been linked to SSRI usage.

I really know nothing about pregnancy or having children (though I have been reading up!).  My OB was recommended to me by a nurse at my university.  I really preferred a female doctor, but the nurse said he was great, so I set up an appointment with him.  I was working for the university as a GTA, but without funding for those positions anymore, I not only don't have that job; I lost the health insurance it came with.  So I need a doctor who accepts Medicaid (which he does).  He went to a great medical school and an even better residency program.  He seemed really cool at first; he had my SO and me in his office after my first exam for counseling.  Since it's our first baby, he was willing to listen to our questions, though we didn't have many at that point.  He asked us about our schooling, financial situation, parents, etc.  He seemed really interested and even said that as our OB, he wants to know about our lives.  He said that when we came in the next time, which would be for an ultra sound, he wanted us to have lots and lots of questions ready for him.

Well, the ultra sound happened, but we didn't even get to see the doctor.  We actually had a ton of questions prepared.  No meeting with him.  Not even a ""hello.""  We were excited enough about the ultra sound video we got to take home that we didn't think to say anything until later.  And, like I said, this is our first time, so we have no idea how this is supposed to work.

So I had my third visit earlier this week.  He did a test he said he forgot to do the first time.  I'm used to female gynos, so I kept accidentally closing my legs on him because it's so uncomfortable to have a man that's not my SO down there, but he was very kind about it.  He actually apologized to me (I told him there was no need for that).  While still in the exam room (and while I was still half-naked), he filled out some paperwork while he asked if we had any questions.  I had been expecting the same sort of office sit down we had the first time, so I was taken a bit off guard.  I've lost about 11 lbs since I got pregnant, and I told him I was worried that I'm still not gaining weight.  He just said, ""You will,"" and didn't explain further.  Well yes, I assumed that being pregnant I will *eventually* gain weight, thank you.  I had also wanted to ask him if the 25-35 lbs I'm supposed to gain changes to 35-45 with my weight loss, or if it's 25-35 from my new lower weight, but his response kind of threw me off.  It was almost as if he didn't want to have to deal with us.  From the moment he walked in, he seemed like he was in a bad mood or something. He asked how I was feeling, and I said, ""Just tired all the time.""  He said, ""Bless your heart,"" very nonchalantly, which I guess was sweet.  I actually did think it was nice, but my SO thought the tone indicated he didn't give one poo.  Because he didn't seem like he really wanted to discuss anything with us, and because my vagina was still out, I didn't ask anymore questions.  He said he'd see us in a month and that was it.  I know it's partly our fault for not taking advantage of him being there, I just didn't feel comfortable and neither did my SO.  

I have so many questions about mid-wife nurses, appetite (even with my vomiting pretty much going away, I have little to no appetite and don't eat much), Lamaze classes, what my vagina's going to look like, etc etc etc.  The doctor seemed really cool at first, but now he seems disinterested or something.  Is this normal?  Since I'm only beginning my second trimester, does it make sense that the doctor doesn't see much need for talking to me other than to say everything looks good?  Should I request an office meeting (while fully clothed!)?  

Hoping for a little advice from those of you who have been here before.  My SO and I just want to make sure our baby is healthy and we want to be prepared for what's to come.  Sorry this is so long!

I need reassurance or... something...,16,9,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/z3x9a/whats_your_experience_with_bleeding_after_a/,"I found out I'm pregnant last Saturday morning.  I scheduled an appointment on Friday to see a doctor to confirm the positive result and have make sure everything is ok since this was kind of a surprise.

Sunday evening I experienced mild spotting; just brown spots on the tissue when I went to the bathroom which I know is pretty normal. It wasn't even enough to require a pad or anything.

 This lasted until yesterday around 4 pm when the brown changed to bright red while I was at work. Then the bleeding got a little heavier, although I wasn't experiencing cramps or pain.  I clocked out of work early and went to the emergency section of the womens hospital in my town, where I waited 2 hours because they forgot to put me in the roster to see a doctor.

When I finally got to see a nurse, she had me pee in a cup and I was bleeding a lot more.  Not as much as I would on my period, but still more than what I think is normal for a pregnant woman.

After that my blood was drawn and I had an ultrasound, but because I'm roughly 6 weeks along they couldn't see much of anything.

They said I tested positive for being pregnant, but they can't figure out what the problem is.  I was told that it's good that I'm not experiencing any pain (except for post-examination discomfort from all the prodding and pap smears) but it's too early to tell if I'm miscarrying, experiencing ectopic pregnancy or if I'm just having slightly heavier than average 1st trimester bleeding.

I'm supposed to go back in 48 hours to see where my hormone levels sit.  If they're double what they were yesterday my body is keeping the pregnancy.  If not, I'm either miscarrying or having an ectopic pregnancy, but both of those are very unlikely if you're not experiencing abdominal pain of some kind.

Did any of you (or your significant others) experience bleeding like this and go on to have a healthy, happy baby?  

I'm really scared and called out of work today even though the doctor told me that it wouldn't make a difference at this point; whatever my body has decided to do is going to happen at this point and I can't do anything to change it.

At my 36 week check up I had an ultrasound to double check the baby's position. At 20 weeks the baby was feet down and at 24, butt down. I haven't felt any huge movements, so I was pretty sure the ultrasound was going to show the same, and it did. 

He looked ""perfectly average"" (in the 49th percentile), and I could actually see his hair on the ultrasound! I met with my OB and we talked about odds of him turning, they where low. Since he had been breech for so long, and my fluid levels where on the low side. We talked about scheduling a c section, and told him we could talk more about it at the 37 week appointment, since I wanted to talk to my partner and the rest of my support people first.  I was really shaken up by the talk of a c section. 

Later that night I emailed my OB and asked him if we could try an external cephalic version. He was willing to try it. He out lined the risks mainly that there is a small chance that the baby could become tangled in it's cord if that happened they would take me for a c section right then. Because of this they do the version in labor and delivery. They also do a NST before and after. 


The next morning I called the care coordinator at my OB's office and set up the appointment for the ECV, it would be exactly a week after getting the U/S that showed that the baby was still breech. In the mean time I got on spinning babies and was doing everything I could to get him to turn. Ice on the top of my belly, upping my water in take [breech tilt](http://www.spinningbabies.com/techniques/activities-for-fetal-positioning/breech-tilt) (this is my least favorite...) The Forward Leaning Inversion, all of it. 

The big day rolled around and my partner, mother and I went to L&amp;D and I got ready in my belly band and hospital gown. The base line non stress test was pretty amazing, my partner hadn't heard the babies heart beat in person before. The baby got closer to the monitor as well so it got really loud. They gave me a shot to relax my uterus, and the babe got super, super active, trying to get the contraction monitor off of me. We'd been in L&amp;D for about 45 minutes before my OB came in with the ultra sound to double check that the baby was still breech before he started. 

Looking for the baby's head up where it was before and nope its not there. It has to be in there some where though... he is head down! We were all absolutely shocked! I am absolutely thrilled that I get the chance to have the birth that I want now. 

I wish I knew what did it, but I have no idea I am just happy it happened!

I am so glad that I discovered this subreddit! So, first a little about me-- I'm 24, engaged to a great guy and daddy that ive known for 10 years, we have two boys (2 and 4), and just found out were pregnant with our third (This one was actually planned). My problem is this-- although we are so excited to finally have planned one, and have lots of support from his family and our friends, I am terrified to tell my parents. I am just finishing up my degree (will graduate in June, and due in July--which is how we planned this out), and right now we have only one income-- we are making it by just fine at the moment but just not much wiggle room-- but obviously the plan is for me to jump into the workforce post delivery. 

Anyway, my parents are likely the most emotionally unsupportive people on the planet, especially my dad. They both have a lot of money, my mom came from it and my dad earns it-- I am an only child, although my dad had two kids right out of highschool, so I have 2 half sisters but they are well into their 40's and live across the country. My parents think that you need to make three figures if you are going to be able to appropriately support ONE child, and up until the past year still were trying to convince us to give up our second child because there was no way we could ""afford it"". I know they will be unsupportive of our choice and it kills me, because at this point in my life I should be able to share this news with my family and have them be happy for me, but I know there will never be a point in my life that I will be able to do that with them. 

My dad thinks we are idiots for having more than one child and complains about how we won't be able to do all of the things for our kids that he did for me (has bought me 2 cars, a house, paid for my college out of pocket, etc.). In reality, this is untrue since both of my boys have trust funds set up through my grandfather to pay for their college, cars, homes, etc) Although I see his point about not being to afford it all by ourselves.

Anyway, I guess I'm just looking for any advice from anyone about what we can do, because obviously we are going to have to come clean eventually about it-- I wish they could be happy for us, but it is just not something they believe in.

Tl;dr -- Excited about expanding our family but parents are unsupportive of our choice to have a third child-- how to break the news??

I'm 24+4 and had been getting really strong, consistent movement over the last 3 weeks so this was very unusual and as soon as I realised it I got quite worried. I rang the midwife line that my health insurance provider operates, and they ran through the list of check-up questions with me, but stopped it once I'd said that rather than simply reduced fetal movement, I wasn't feeling any movement at all, and told me to go straight in to the hospital.

As you can imagine, this was pretty stressful and worrying, though I stayed pretty calm because freaking out would help nobody, and my poor partner, though trying not to let it show, was in dire need of some reassurance before we left. Once we got in, all of the hospital staff were lovely - it was really quiet in there which surprised me, in a nice way!

We were sent up to the assessment room on the delivery suite because I'm over 24 weeks, where they immediately took me down to one of the birthing rooms to try and find her heartbeat on an fMRI machine. They couldn't find it, but I still wasn't totally freaking out because they'd said quite a lot before checking that they weren't sure if they'd be able to find it with this equipment straight away at her size, 24 weeks is so little. So the midwife who was checking went off and got a doctor and an ultrasound machine. They scanned me and straight away found her heartbeat - very reassuring!

The reason they couldn't find it initially and that I couldn't feel her was that for some reason she was lying very, very low down in my pelvis; well below where she was expected to be by anyone! Once they got the trace heartbeat eventually sorted on her really annoying position on the fMRI, they gave me a load of icewater to drink and left us to it for about 20 minutes, and of course the second they'd found her on the monitor she started kicking away where I could feel it.


So all worked out fine in the end, and all the women in the hospital were so lovely. The birthing rooms aren't *amazing* - I'd prefer upright seating options as well as the adjustable bed, but they have birthing balls and nice new big shower suites and a lot of privacy. The midwife, as we were getting ready to leave, as well, was really lovely - told us to come back in any time we were worried about anything, and not to be feeling like we couldn't because everything was fine this time. Said they were always here for us for checking up on anything.

1355419486.0,3,self.pregnant,14skok,Pregnant girlfriend broke up,10,7,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/14skok/pregnant_girlfriend_broke_up/,"Well, it's sort of a long read, but I really need to get it out.

I'm 20, and she's 19.

Our relationship has been up and down like most relationships, and we've worked through it all.

She did break up with me around five months ago, due to a lot of stress and depression surrounding other parts of her life. A few weeks or so after the break up, we decided to meet up after she initiated contact with me, and she told me she missed me, and that she wanted to give us another chance. Great!

Things were awesome again. We spent a lot of time together, we had a lot of sex, and at one point, she had been lazy with her birth control pills. We both knew, and figured we'd be okay. She got pregnant.

We both agreed to get an abortion, and that it was the right choice given our current stance in life. We're both getting educated, both living at home and so forth. Simply put, we're not ready to have any children yet.

I didn't handle the situation very good leading up to all this, thinking back on it - which I've done a lot lately. I've acted very nonchalant and laid back on the outside, appearing as if I don't even care about what she's going through, and I haven't been very considerate as to what she's going through - both in body and in mind.

In my defense, I have never been through all this before, and even though we both suspected it before the test came back positive it came as a shock. I have no idea how to handle all this.

She has no idea how much I've thought about it, and how much it has affected me on the inside.

Up until about two weeks ago we spent a lot of time together. She stayed at my house for a month, and things seemed great - besides her being more tired than usual.

However, I didn't handle everything as good as I should have when we were spending our time together, regarding the whole pregnancy-thing. I wasn't very understanding about her being tired, not wanting to have sex, not wanting me to touch her, and so on. I questioned it a lot, and I got a little hurt and offended, not even considering that it was all part of the pregnancy. At this point, she's around 8 weeks pregnant.

She left on Saturday two weeks ago to spend some time with her family and to visit her grandmother, and I was in a bit of a bad mood for a couple of reasons. She didn't tell me she was going home that Saturday, and I had planned for us to do something together. Another reason being that she didn't seem to want any prolonged physical contact with me, and I was a bit hurt by that fact.

She kissed me good bye, and she got picked up shortly after.

Usually, when we spent time apart, she would call me - or at least text me - a lot. When she got up in the morning, before going off to work, she would call me. She would usually text me when at work, whenever she had the chance. We would always talk to each other when she went to bed. I have always been used to us talking a lot when weren't with each other.

The last two weeks she has been gradually withdrawing from me. She hasn't initiated much contact, and whenever she did, it was very short. I tried calling her, and more often than not she wouldn't answer me, and I ended up texting her instead.

It was never anything important, and it was usually just to tell her I love her and for her to have a good night and so on. She didn't tell me she loved me back, though, which I felt was unusual for her.

Our interactions felt more... Casual. I could tell she obviously wanted her space, but I'm not going to cut off contact with her, so I was persistent. Sending her short texts telling her I love her and that I'm thinking about her.

Sometimes, when I called her, she wouldn't answer and I would get a text in return instead, where she told me she was busy or whatever. Again, unusual for her.

I also tried to meet up with her to talk face to face, because I was feeling her withdrawing, and she always came up with excuses, that she was busy, or too tired, or whatever. Fair enough. I didn't push too much, and asked if another day was better.

My reasoning was that she was withdrawing because she didn't really want to have an abortion, and that she felt that I wouldn't support her if she decided to keep it, and I wanted to tell her that I support her, no matter what she ended up doing. She didn't want to meet up, it seemed, and I didn't want to do it over the phone.

I wanted to meet up, and tell her face to face, that I didn't give a shit about all that's been going down.

At one point, I may have pushed a bit too much, for us to meet up, and she told me she wanted to spend time alone and just sort her head out, and think about stuff. She wasn't very specific as to what, of course, but I suspected - like i mentioned - that she was doubting her initial decision to have an abortion. I told her I was worried about her needing to think and sort her head out, fearing that she was doubting our relationship and her decision to have an abortion.

On Monday this week she had an appointment with her doctor, I believe. I don't really know anymore. I don't even know if she went or not.

Anyways, I wished her luck and so on.

Later that day, I got a text from her, saying she doesn't have any feelings for me anymore, and that she probably wouldn't ever again, and that we shouldn't talk for a while. She also said she cared a lot for me, and that she still wanted me in her life, but just as friends.

This is exactly what she told me last time she was under a lot of stress and ended up breaking it off with me, with her grandfather dying and her guilt for not visiting him and so forth. She was pretty determined too, but she backtracked on that decision later on, when things settled down.

I didn't respond, and I got a text later asking me if I got her message, to which I replied ""Yeah"", and she texted me back saying she's sorry for hurting my feelings.

Later that night, I sent her a pretty long email - due to not being able to talk to her face to face - telling her that no matter her decision, that I support her and that if she wants to keep it, I want to be there for her and the baby. Better late than never, right?

She was probably asleep when I sent it, and I didn't get any response until the morning after.

First she responded telling me it was already done - the abortion that is. I told her I didn't know what to feel about that, that I didn't know if I should feel sad or relieved, and she seemed to get pretty angry at that.

""That was what you wanted. I can't just abandon my life and you can't just start thinking like that now that it's over. Good timing."" Bad attempt at translating from Norwegian. lol

Then she texted me and told me she hadn't terminated it yet, but that she had made an appointment with the clinic or whatever. When I asked her when, she said ""Soon..""

Later that day, I told her that if she was a hundred percent sure about her decision I wanted to be there for her, during and after, to which she responded ""I'm going to get rid of it, and I'm doing it alone.""

After a little back and forth of me trying to tell her that I felt like shit about all that was going down, and how bad I handled it, she told me that our breakup had nothing with the pregnancy to do, and that I told her what I felt about it all wouldn't change a damn thing, and that we wouldn't get back together because of it.

I don't know what to make of all this. I'm so confused. I was supposed to be there for her, and support her through it. We were supposed to go through it all as a couple, and then she goes and breaks up with me. Anyone been through anything similar?

This is all a mess, I know, and I've probably left some things out.

It's far too early to take a pregnancy test, and probably too early to even worry, but I've never had these problems with PMS or any previous late periods, so I thought it'd be worth it to ask. 

My boyfriend and I don't use condoms (that's not the issue here and your opinion on the matter is your own). We use the pull-out method, and he does not pull out when I am on my period, or the day or two leading up to it. We have sex regularly through the month. 

UPDATE:
excuse my dirty bathroom counter. Faint, but it's there. No baby.

I have a few questions for those who have traveled this road before, this is my first baby, and my OB appointment is still a few weeks away...

1) I heard that you shouldn't elevate your body temperature unnecessarily ( i.e. taking hot showers)  does this count for space heaters as well? My office is freezing, and I have a tiny fan heater under my desk, it's just enough to keep the goosebumps away.

2) is it ok to fast while you're pregnant and healthy? Nothing dramatic, 24 hours is how long I usually fast.


I'm sure I'll have more questions as things really get cooking, but these are the pressing ones I can think of at the moment ;) THANKS!

So relieving to hear something that takes a positive approach to birth. The woman who runs it is a midwife here who had previously worked as a doula, has been running the classes since 2007 and follows up with the women/couples she sees as much as possible, so collates data on their experiences. Up to this point, she's collected info on 700 individual births, and of those:

* 15% have involved an epidural, compared to 70-80% national average

* 6% have needed a c-section, compared to around 26% national average

The survey asks about perceived experiences of birth as well, asking those who give birth to categorise their experiences under either 'comfortable' 'uncomfortable' 'painful' or 'terribly painful'.

* Most described the phase of active labour (so 5-10cm dilated) as either 'comfortable' or 'uncomfortable'. 
* Only 7% described it as 'terribly painful'. This is such a vast contrast to the normal narrative of birth as seen in the media. 
* Most described too the baby's head emerging as 'uncomfortable'.


Having done mindfulness mediation before and knowing that it really works for me to cope with stress and life in general I was really open to the hypnobirthing idea anyway, but hearing this, and experiencing the day today, really reinforced it for me. It was great for my partner too. We watched a few birth videos of women giving birth who'd used hypnobirthing methods and they were all SO calm. The one in the Irish setting in particular that we got to see was really, really reassuring.


I know I'm very lucky in being able to afford the course - it was quite expensive, and even with health insurance that I pay for on a reduced basis through work, we can't claim it all back, but I really feel it was worth it. Part of the course is being given the tracks the woman who runs the course has recorded, but the main parts of them are very similar to a freely available one I had been listening to as well from [here](http://archive.org/details/HypnoBirthing), if anyone else wants to give it a go. 



So glad we're doing this.

Long story short: I'm a guy who slept with a girl who then got pregnant. 

Since I've found out about the pregnancy, I've been there 100% as I think people should make sure they address their responsibilities. This was a one night thing and we are not together.

So far she is 15 weeks gone and has a due date of the 24th of December. This has been confirmed by a 12 week scan.

We slept together on the 15th of March and I'm trying to work out whether there is a possibility this child is mine, i have looked online and most of the information I have found shows the earliest conception date to be 28th March.

Is this right? Or is there a chance that I am the father?

I do know she slept with someone on the 25th March so as you can tell I'm very concerned about becoming emotionally and financially attached to a child that may not be mine.

I wanted to ask people who have been down a similar road for advice.

TLDR: My old girlfriend is pregnant and says if I don't marry her, she will ""have her baby and ruin the rest of my life"" (her words not mine). I am fine with paying child support, but won't this hurt her more than it will hurt me? How can I help her not throw away everything (college, future husband) in her desire for revenge?

My girlfriend and I were dating for about 7 months now. However, things kind of petered off for me. I know I'm not the perfect person either, but I knew she wasn't right for me and that it was time to move on. I decided I want to talk to her about it face to face and did. I told her honestly that we weren't compatible and how I felt, and what I wanted to do about it. She was hurt, and I didn't feel good breaking up, but better then being in a bad relationship and breaking up years down the road.

I thought that was the end of it, but then she gave me a call to watch a movie. I thought okay hopefully she's fine with being friends again. We watched the movie and she convinced me she was a sane person, and I did feel more attracted to her than I did before. I guess I regret it now, but I was willing to believe she saw I wasn't going to put up with some of her bad things  and was trying to change. 

We decided to try to make it work again, and we had sex. The relationship was pretty pleasant now. Then about a month later, she takes a plane back home to China. She calls me and says guess what, you're fucked. I've been dumping the semen from the condom into me after we've been having sex, and I am 1 month pregnant.

She is now in Shanghai (she's Chinese), and she says either marry her (she wants US citizenship) or she'll have the baby. I'm kind of taken aback by this and surprised someone would do this, but sure enough, here I am.

I talked with her, but she is an emotional trainwreck. There was nothing I could logically say to get through to her. What's worse is when I talked to her mother, her mom is encouraging her to carry out this plan of ""marriage or baby"". Her other option she gave me was paying $30,000 to abort the baby.

I have no idea how to handle this. I tried reminding her she's a beautiful, charming girl who once caught my eye and is better off terminating the baby and looking for mutual love and a husband to share children with. I have talked with her closest friends in China over the phone, and they don't know how to help her. They also want her to terminate the baby and forget about me.

I offered to pay the child support and do what I'm legally obligated to do, but I just don't like the idea of her hurting herself and the baby to get back at me. I also offered to pay 50% to 100% of the hospital fees and whatnot for the abortion. I told her 50% isn't fair because I'm the guy and don't have a baby in my stomach. Even though it takes two to tango, I will pay for all of it.

What do you guys think she should do? Am I wrong in thinking that an abortion is the best move here? I've been called nothing but an asshole, tool, douchbag, and the like from her and her mother. I have never said anything hurtful back to them. I know it's horrible to kill an innocent baby, but it's even worse for her to go through with it. A baby is truly a wonderful thing, but at this time, it will really reduce what she can do with her life. 

On another note, does anyone know of an emotional clip about life with a loving husband and children I can send her? She needs something to bring her back to reality. I want her to see what she is throwing away. She really needs some support, and I don't know how to give that to her. I've toyed with the idea of pretending I want to marry her on condition she aborts the child (still 1 month at the moment), but that just feels wrong.

I have been worried since the beginning of this pregnancy it seems. At 12 weeks I had a subchorionic hemmorage. I thought I had lost the little guy. The amount of blood I lost was scary. So they put him on monthly ultrasounds to monitor the blood clot and his growth.  I was a 10lb+ baby and I am over 6ft tall so I thought, growth restriction? Not a big deal!
At my 20 week anatomy scan we found out he has a two vessel cord.  I was sent to a high risk DR who said everything looked good and should be fine, but they were going to put me on monthly growth ultrasounds. I thought, not a big deal, already on those. At this point he was measuring huge, in the 96th percentile and I was fighting for my due date (which I was sure of because I was doing the basal body temperature thing when I got pregnant.)
At my last ultrasound he had dropped down to the 88th percentile, which was at the time a relief. I was thinking, 8lb baby vs 10lb baby wouldn't be so bad.
Last Wednesday I had to go to the ER for 5 minute apart contractions, and was diagnosed with an irritable uterus.
Today I go in for a Non-stress test, they wern't thrilled with his movements until I put some music on to wake him up, which worked but I had to stay on the NST for extra time to get him to move.

Then my fundal height came in at 31.5 weeks, I'm 32. That doesn't seem like a big deal, but until now I had been measuring about 3 weeks ahead(remember I expected him to be huge.) . I have a growth ultrasound on Monday so my midwife said we would just check it out then.

I hate not knowing whats going on. And I hate being told not to worry until next Monday.  I am pretty strong in my Christian faith so I am trying super hard to pray and not be anxious. Does anyone have any advice/stories/knowledge to share?  I think talking about it and staying informed is the best way for me to stay chill.  I know if he stops growing they will induce/c-section me. I've really been hoping for a natural birth at a birth center. I'm also worried about my contractions... could my body be trying to tell me he needs out?
I'm also afriad of the idea of having a 32/33 weeks preemie if he has stopped growing.

On a brighter note, I have my first ultrasound coming up today.  I can't wait to see my baby for the first time!

EDIT: First ultrasound!  So cool! He/She had a nice strong heartbeat and measured within 2 days of where he/she should be based on my LMP.  She did give us the ""Is that a twin?"" scare. She did a transvaginal first and said it might just be the way the probe was angled, so then she did a transabdominal and didn't see a second kiddo. She said she's pretty sure there's just one, but we'll check again in a month to make sure.

I asked about the nausea, and she said I could take OTC ginger pills, Vitamin B6, and she gave me a prescription for topical Phenergan.  Hopefully, something in that list can help knock it out.

I was diagnosed at.... 8 after a 15 minute grand mal. My seizures are under control (thanks to my Lamictal and Zonigran) and I haven't had one in years. My boyfriend was just recently diagnosed after a grand mal. He's on Trilipital or something but he doesn't wanna take it. Thank God his mother has stayed on him about it. 

Epilepsy runs in my family. VERY badly. On my mother's side: my mom and her twin sister had it, and their mom, and gramma and great gramma and great grampa all had epilepsy (it was traced that far). My mom died from a seizure at 24 (same year I had my first seizure). It runs in his family too. His mother has narcolepsy and his father has epilepsy. His sister has it and she has had up to 7 seizures a day. His step sister has recessive genes for it. I don't know about the rest of the family.

We want kids one day. We talk about it all the time. Rebecca and Harold Jr, private school, buy them each a pony.... maybe not ponies :) Just recently, though, I started thinking about this. I love children and I want a house full of them. But I don't want them to have to suffer through crazy birth defects...... I was born with a VERY high chance of spina bifida and cleft pallet. Thanks to the grace of God, I was born with nothing physically or mentallywrong. We'd both love it no matter what happens. It would be our baby and it'd be perfect to us.

My neurologist said I'd have to get off my medications for at least 3 months (to clear it out of my blood stream) before TRYING to conceive. And as anyone could guess, that's a HORRIBLE idea. But if I take them during pregnancy, that can..... terminate it, cause side effects, they might even not work..... If I DON'T take it, I'll have seizures that can kill me (SUESD) and the baby or just kill the baby. I'd grieve to death knowing that my body killed our baby.......... 

I'm against abortion, Except in certain circumstances...... but that's not the point here..... He doesn't worry about this stuff. He's only thinking positively about it. We're not trying to get pregnant. We don't want a baby in the near future. In a few years but not now.... We really want a child. I don't want to adopt. I'm open to it and I'm more than willing to but I'd rather give birth  to my own. I know it sounds selfish but it's just not the same relationship...... No 9 months of blood swapping, no..... 4+ months of skin-to-skin bonding and you'd eventually have to tell them they're adopted. I know that's really selfish......

I don't know how to feel besides depressed and sad and scared and helpless..... I don't want to bring life into this world only to watch it suffer or even die.....

So I decided, ""might as well get a pregnancy test and check.""

So I picked on up as SafeWay, didn't bother reading the instructions, stuck a stick under my pee and the result came up positive... Very teary morning but then I accepted it.

Well I took another test a couple hours later, this time AFTER reading the instructions (only hold it under the pee for 5secs, keep it upright wth the blue tip down) whereas before I had not... And this test was negative.

I have taken 6 pregnancy tests, and so far the last 5 (over the course of a week, on diff days, trying for in the morning mostly before pee gets diluted) have all been negative...

So how did I get a positive test originally and all negative since? I just want to know for sure what the odds are of each.

I just removed it for my off week on Sunday and just started my period yesterday (Tuesday). 

I insert and remove my rings on a schedule of in for three weeks, out for one, always on a Sunday. I always remove it in the morning but last cycle I forgot to insert it until 11-12 at night. 

I got the symptoms of ovulation, I *think*- I don't recall having those before, but I'm not entirely sure. 

Yesterday I noticed lots of clots in my period blood- fairly normal for my pre-BC periods but ever since I've been on nuvaring, I've had light, blood-only periods. Until yesterday. 

I had awful, awful cramping in my ovaries and uterus yesterday, I haven't gotten them today but I just woke up. I don't usually cramp bad during my period and especially since I've been on BC. I've had awful problems with fatigue, I just want to sit down and fall asleep everywhere I go. I've been nauseous for the last ~3 weeks, on the edge of puking fairly often. I did puke once about a week ago when giving oral, his penis hit my throat and it immediately caused me to vomit on him. I've been bloated but I'm not sure if that's because I've been eating junk food lately. I have not had tender breasts or darker areolas. I had a sudden attack of diarrhea on Monday, I never get that unless I'm sick. I've had headaches constantly this last few weeks. That may just be from dehydration though, as sometimes I just don't drink as much water as I should. No backaches, spotting, and I haven't kept track of my basal body temperature. I've been having *serious* vaginal discharge- I usually do from the ring as it thickens cervical mucus, but it's been horrendous how much discharge I've had. I have to wear a pantiliners because it just randomly leaks. I'm not sure if I've had mood swings, I have a pretty swingy mood to begin with. I realize I'm in a bad mood and I just decide to get over it. So I'm not sure if I've had abnormal swings. I've been having to pee frequently, last night I peed three times in ~1 1/2hrs. I've always had a strong sense of smell and I haven't noticed change in that. I've been feeling grossed out by foods I normally enjoy, the thought of eating a chocolate truffle thing made me almost sick last night, and I love chocolate. Haven't really noticed any particular cravings. I've been very thirsty constantly lately but I'm usual very thirsty to begin with. My libido is usually very high, but yesterday and the day previous, it dropped to very low. Just something I noticed. 

All that being said... I am on BC, and I'm currently on my period. I took an EPT the day I took my nuvaring out this cycle, this past Sunday, and it came up negative. I'm taking another this Sunday and another the next. 

What I really want to know is the following: is it possible to have a period while pregnant? Is it possible that my lateness in inserting the ring caused my entire cycle to be nullified? Do you think the symptoms point to pregnancy? Thank you all for your help, I'm a little worried. 

I used the list of symptoms from justmommies.com. 

If I do turn up pregnant, that little babe will grow up very loved. My boyfriend is the man I intend to marry, whose children I want to bear, and who I want to grow old with. Ideally, though, we were going to wait until after college to start a family. Either way, I know we'll grow into a good family, and I know for a fact his family will be supportive of us- I'm having concerns about mine, though- they've always had a judgement thing about having children out of wedlock. I'll most likely be written out of my grandparents' will. I believe that my mom and dad will be supportive though, I'm praying for it.

This is my first pregnancy; I had my week 39 appointment today and the doctor informed me I was not dilated and my cervix was still in the process of thinning (same as last week, no real progression). Last night when I went to the bathroom it looked like I passed my mucus plug, and there was more around 2am when I went to the bathroom again.

I woke up with intense lower back pain, and constant lower abdominal cramping, kind of like really strong period cramps. It hurts to sit up straight, as my back is really achy. The cramps seem to subside for a bit, but since I'm only really feeling them lower in my abdomen I'm not sure if this is actually labor. I haven't started timing anything yet, but I do feel like the cramps are starting to come in waves. I had cramps earlier this week for about 2hrs in the middle of the night, so I don't know if this is actual labor or false.. My doctor said my stomach would get really hard and the pain would start at the top of the uterus.. which I've not yet experienced.

I've been up for about an hour now, so I'm going to start timing them. I just wasn't sure if I could progress from nothing to actually going into labor that quickly. Not to mention it's more intense in my back, it seems!

Earlier this week I had no back pain, so this is definitely different. (Currently reclining on the couch seems to help, but the waves of cramping haven't stopped yet).

Baby is head down, in birthing position and has been for almost 2 months now. Any experienced mamas have suggestions or advice? Alleviating pain? Is this actual labor? Can you have a change that quickly? (We're talking less than 24hrs after the appointment!)

He says I feel warmer, everything about me seems softer and ""more womanly"", and that he feels even more physically attracted to me than normal. He also says my scent has changed somehow, not good or bad, just different. It mainly just amazes me that he would pick up on such tiny details like that.

If conception occurred, it would have been in the past month. My period is late, but I'm just getting back on my birth control pills after a month off due to shipping issues with Medco, so I assume that is probably the cause of all of the above.

I had my anatomy scan at 20 weeks, exactly. The baby is extremely squirmy. My appointment was over an hour long with the ultrasound woman, and we couldn't get the baby to roll over so we could get a profile picture! I peed twice, laid on both sides, got up and walked around and no dice. I didn't want to find out the sex with out my S/O because he is in the UK, and I am in the states. It didn't seem fair to know before he did. The sonographer turned off the monitor when she got to the goods. But she printed a picture, and put it in a sealed envelope for me. When I got back I waited for my so to get on skype and we opened it together. It's a boy!

Even though I always said I wasn't hoping for either sex, I found my self kind of disappointed that it wasn't a girl. 

Anyway. Cut to a week ago, and things finally came to a head with a co worker of mine. He has constantly interrupted me. Both in front of our employees and customers. I tried talk to him on numerous times about this to no avail. He did this again, and I turned and walked away from him. Into our lil back hallway. He followed me, and things came to a head when he again interrupted me. I yelled at him that he did not get to talk to me like this, and I went to leave the back room, and stood between the door and I. I told him politely get the fuck out of my way. The next day, I quit. 

I talked to my old boss to see if the project was still going on, and it is. But now It seems like everything is on hold. So here I am 22 weeks along, technically I have a job. I just don't know when I can start getting hours again, and I am feeling a bit absurd to be honest.

I just found this subreddit and thought it would be the most appropriate to post here. 

My gf and I had sex September 6 and she was still on her period, but was very light and ending. We had unprotected sex a few times that weekend but I never came inside of her. I remember Saturday her period was completely finished and after sex she still bled a little and we stopped. A week later she was at my apartment and said a little blood came out (she spotted?) but that was that, we didn't think too much of it at the time. Her period was due two days ago but she says its common for her to start a little late. 

Shes been sick a couple times since then. Getting some dizziness, headaches, and stomach cramps (the last 3-4 days) that come and go. We haven't noticed her breast swell but I think her nipples have become more sensitive. 

Can she be pregnant? I told her to take a pregnancy test but she says if she is she wouldn't be able to handle the stress of that and her exams this week. Also, what are some affordable abortion options? We're both college students so we don't have that much money...

Thank you so much if you have read this and decided to answer. I know having unprotected sex was a bad idea and I have since made it clear no sex without condom on. I have taken responsibility and promised I will be there for her but I just don't know how I would handle getting an abortion...let alone help her pay for it.

____
In early May my wife left for a summer long internship out of state, and as recent newlyweds we made use of the last days with a little more marital fun to make up for the time we were to lose.

We were worried at first that something may have happened but she got her period around May 16, which she described as being normal. Not abnormal in any way, regular flow and color.

She has told me that her period is really late, and recently has felt some lower back pain and tiredness and some nausea. 

I'm not at all worried about infidelity at all, my main question is could she be pregnant or is it a really late period due to a change in time zones (+3 hours) and dietary habits?

Pregnant?,1,2,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/13a09o/im_not_sure_what_to_think_of_this_pregnant/,"On November 6th, me and my 16 year old girlfriend had sex. I used a condom, but it seemed to roll up a little and I kept having to pull it down, it never rolled up to the head. When I was going to.. *cough* finish I pulled out and took it off, and some semen got on her lower stomach and pubic area. I wiped what I saw of it off within 15 seconds, but I don't know if any dripped on her vagina. She started bleeding later thinking it was from me, and the next day she said she was starting to cramp and it was her period. It lasted a few days and ended about 5-6 days after we had sex. Now, on novermber 15th, she is saying she is feeling hot and sore all over, and her breasts look bigger and feel heavier. She said that has happened before when she's gotten sick, mainly due to the temperature change (it has gotten ridiculously cold now). She also has headaches. She has not had any nausea.

Here's what I'm concerned about:
Some of the semen could have dripped on her vagina and traveled up and fertilized an egg.
Next day: her period starts
implantation takes 6-10 days, so the fertilized egg could have implanted after her period ended. 
She has normal cycles, because her last cycle ended in late september/early october

What do you think the chances are that she is pregnant? Or is it just illness, like possibly the flu?

Thanks a lot!

Edit:
Today she says her breasts are feeling normal, though looking bigger still. She has a headache and body aches, and she seems to think it could be a virus, such as the flu. She says she does get the white discharge most women get from ovulation, but she says she doesn't remember when it happened. It would have had to happen at the earliest on Nov 3rd for any semen that *may* have dripped on her vagina to fertalize an egg on the 6th, before she had her period on the 7th.
