I've taken shrooms 3x before, never dropped acid, but I loved shrooms so I decided to take two tabs with my friends yesterday. We went to the ocean where they kayaked and I stand up paddle boarded. 

I've surfed for a while, but wasnt really planning on trying it on acid. The ocean was so beautiful and the waves were so big and perfect I knew I had to at least try. 

This was about 4 hours after I dropped the acid, so I was still very much in my trip. Paddled into a wave, caught it perfectly, an amazing 35 second ride across the face of a beautiful wave. I turned to look at the wave I was riding,the setting sun had turned it the most beautiful combination of ocean blue and sunset orange. I dipped my fingers in the wave as I contiuned to surf along, and it exploded with color and beauty where I had put my hands. Great experience. I feel blessed I was able to surf on LSD, It's a unique experience, but not one I would recommend attempting unless you're very comfortable in the water in the first place.

Maybe this is a lame story because LSD is so personal, but I thought I would share it anyway, I thought It was interesting.",,False,,t5_2qhvj,False,,,True,t3_115i9o,http://www.reddit.com/r/LSD/comments/115i9o/first_trip_surfing_on_lsd/,

Going into this trip I had a two week tolerance break, so I am fairly confident I was completely at baseline. I ended up placing 6 drops into a shot glass of distilled water, and after transferring the drops into another vial and washing it out, I tossed back both of them with a vehement cheers.

My friend and I began our come-up by watching Planet Earth and listening to The Lion King soundtrack. Within 20 minutes, I was already feeling the initial effects, and out of nowhere we began laughing hysterically at the context of the situation. Here my friend and I were being propelled into a completely different universe as we watched these hilarious penguins waddle about in a blizzard all the while listening to The Circle of Life. Everything aligned absolutely perfectly, and it felt like we were actually there with the penguins. Within 40 minutes, we were nearing our peak and decided to throw on Clint Mansell’s The Fountain soundtrack which ended up being a profound auditory and visual journey.

By the one hour mark, I was peaking and I was peaking beautifully. I decided to lay on my bed to allow myself to completely be enveloped by everything. As I stared up at the ceiling listening to the crisp music build up in intensity, I sat there, asking myself “Who are you? Where are you? How did you get here?” The thought of ‘me’ did not exist, nor did the thought of my friend exist. We began talking about everything and anything, but our voices seemed cosmically connected and echoed throughout the room. Since I was peering upwards and could not view his physical self, it felt as though our thoughts were being tossed around the room at a million miles an hour. At this point the visuals were absolutely fascinating and almost indescribable. The popcorn on my ceiling began to create gorgeous patterns that shifted in a quicksand fashion, and the longer I peered into one spot the more detailed the patterns became. At one point a saw the entire alphabet littered across my ceiling in orange, red, green, purple, and at another faces that greeted me with absolute happiness offered me with fleeting smiles.

Perhaps the most amazing visual spectacle came at about an 1:30 into our journey. As I laid there on my bed echoing universal thoughts to my friend, the discussion of “What are we?” arose. Discussing back and forth, we came to the realization that we are simply energy and that reality is merely a facade created by the complex vibrations within this aura of energy. As I came to this realization, I asked myself “How significant are you?” and BOOM! I saw the universe unfold before my eyes in a cascading fashion. First I saw myself, then my house, then my city, then my country, then the earth, then our solar system, then our galaxy, and then our universe, and so on and so forth. It kept continually zooming out right before my eyes in an exponential and never ending manner, and right then it hit me: I am so very small in the cosmic scheme of things, yet at the same time, I matter. I matter because I influence the world around me on a day to day basis. The vibrations I send collide with all the other vibrations that surround me and there must be a balance of positive and negative energy within our world. I never truly understood the the concept of the Buddhist idea of Yin and Yang, but it finally clicked for me. For every amount of darkness, there must be an equal amount of light; for all the negative energy in our world, there must be an equal amount of positive. This thought resonated the rest of the trip for both my friend and I.

Around the 2 hour mark, The Fountain finished playing and we decided to throw on Lemon Jelly and go into another room in my house. As we entered the room, it felt like we were in a weird and quirky music video. The change of pace from a dramatic movie soundtrack to a light hearted and positive soundscape was immediately noticeable, and we started laughing our asses off for no reason whatsoever and ended up lying down on the floor. Amongst our laughter, I started to observe my cat very closely. She seemed to realize that we were on an elevated plane, and I noticed that she was listening to the music with us. I watched her ears shift in attention to all the vibrations of my bass as it echoed throughout the house. At one point at the end of a song, there was a strenuous hissing noise and she acted accordingly my running around the room in a frantic manner, but as soon as the music calmed down, she followed suit. I remember witnessing this on another trip before, but it was very neat to see her play along with us. My friend commented that “maybe she’s perma-fried and on a never ending acid trip”, and I couldn’t help but hysterically agree.

While laying in this room, my friend and I recollected on our past. It had been a while since I had seen him, yet I have known him since I was just a small child. We were amused at the fact that here we are, nearly two decades later, tripping together and having an absolutely incredible time. It felt like we were young children again, enjoying everything that life had to offer. We discussed that maybe this is why we do drugs, to reclaim the joy and wonder of childhood. We discussed how unfathomable it is for our government to persecute individuals for willingly altering their state of consciousness. We discussed how much propaganda and false notions surround psychedelics. We discussed everything from religion to politics to science to music for the next hour.

About 3 hours in, things started to pick up in intensity for me. As I was laying there, I started to notice that thoughts were passing through my head at what seemed to be a billion miles per hour. At one point I would be discussing something and then not 5 seconds later, I would completely forget what the topic at hand even was. Visuals started to pick up, and I felt like I was floating so I decided to dive into the realm of closed eye visuals and lose touch with my body completely. Under closed eyes, I remember looking at an obscure planet from a space eye view as it was being color shaded with these beautiful pastel colors. Surrounding the planet were stars that glowed very bright colors and were surrounded by wavy patterns, akin to an atom molecule. These stars weren't stars, however, but instead seemed to be small faces that greeted me with joyous smiles, and there were thousands of them accented in all types of colors. Just as soon as this planet was created, things began to ""erase"" and once it was gone there was a pyramid in its stead. Atop this pyramid I was looking at a being that resembled myself. For the remainder of my blastoff, I sat there talking to this projection of myself about everything. I cannot recall what we discussed for the most part, but the primary thing that stuck with me was the same thought that echoed earlier: ""Your mind is the most powerful force in the universe, so cherish that fact and accept you are one with everything. Reality is a facade created by the collective consciousness built by the energy of the billions of minds that have lived through the years.""

As I awoke from my closed eye journey, I was greeted by even more intense open eyed visuals. My walls began to melt before my eyes all the while my ceiling breathed in manner of a flag waving. As my ceiling waved, it displayed all the colors of the rainbow in one of the greatest visual spectacles I’ve ever seen. My bare ceiling turned into a canvas for me to paint anything I could dream of. I enjoyed this spectacle for a good while, and then retreated back to my room with my friend. The remainder of this trip was filled to the brim with phenomenal music, great discussions, beautiful visuals, delectable fruits and smoothies, and a short walk around the neighborhood as a refresher. About the 10 hour mark, we decided to open up a few Pyramid Hefeweizens and enjoy the last couple hours of our trip. On that note, never before has a beer tasted as delicious as I noticed flavors and aromas that I have never even realized were a part of my favorite beer. After catching a small buzz, my friend and I decided it was time to slumber.

&gt;""Tell me one last thing,"" said Harry. ""Is this real? Or has this been happening inside my head?"" Dumbledore beamed at him, and his voice sounded loud and strong in Harry's ears even though the bright mist was descending again, obscuring his figure.

The jar was now empty, so we decided to fill it with vodka on saturday night (for the burning of the man) and see what happened.  We decided to start with 4 ml, so I took it, made myself a plate for dinner, and ten minutes later started to feel it and couldn't even eat.

Another ten minutes pass and I was fully enveloped in psychadelic space.  For a moment I was terrified that I overdid it (to be honest, I probably did), sounds and smells and sights all just melted into colors around me, and I could barely see in front of me.  But I realized there was nothing to do now and so I'd better hold on.  At that point most of my friends dosed with half of what I did (or less), and all reported a really quick and intense come up similar to mine.

We walked over towards the man for the fire and the sky was pulsing, there were lines of light connecting everything, and it felt like I was observing the fabric of the universe vibrating and pulsing towards the center of the desert, towards the man.  When the man burned I laughed and cried and hugged all my friends who were in the same place as me, and what followed was the most spiritual and emotional and euphoric 24 hours of my life.  I didn't sleep, I just explored, danced, met people and talked.  I also went to the temple and meditated and prayed and discovered parts of myself I didn't know existed.  For the first acid trip in my life, didn't smoke a single cigarette.

I saw a new painting by Alex Grey, (I had watched him and his wife painting it earlier in the week), walked around with my friends dressed as wizards, and we felt for the night that magic truly existed everywhere around us.

When the sun came up it was like I was starting a new life.  I went back to camp and met up with some more friends, and we hopped on a mutant vehicle and explored the art deep out in the desert.  When I finally came down the following evening, I felt like a new man, and I still do.

I don't know how much acid I took, but since the people who took half or less tripped just as hard and for nearly as long, I'm guessing it could have been ten hits or more.  Anywhere else in the world I don't think I would have made it, but at Burning Man I held on to my sanity and explored myself and others in a beautiful way.

There were probably a grand total of 300-500 people MAX at the festival as it was a small one and 80 hits were sold (at cost, no profit)  mostly on Saturday. 

It was the most amazing feeling finding a giant portion of this festival enjoying and talking about what I supplied. It was a great feeling and I was honored to have made it happen. It wasn't because it was me supplying it ( that would be egotistical) 

It was because I sincerely MADE a bunch of people's day with a quality product, at a cheap price, for fun!

""is tHis lsD?"" ""why does acid make my mouth numb"" ""does acid always make you tripz for 36 hours :0""
And honestly, it's annoying. People seem to forget they can google things. I think this subreddit would be a lot better if we focused on general ideas and discussions about LSD, rather than answering noob questions everyday. 

So here, i'll compile a list of facts that people can refer to so they don't have to post a new thread. 

**LSD**
 - The trip should start within 45 minutes, depending on dose and last no more than 12 hours. Mind you - i'm reffering to the trip, I've been known to have mild visuals 24 hours later if i hav'nt slept yet. By definition, LSD is a scentless/tasteless chemical, meaning - if your blotters taste bitter, spicey, spunky or anything other than like paper:

A. It's not LSD

B. There's something else in conjunction with the LSD on the blotter causing the bitter taste such as weird ink (not as common as you hope).

Some chemical compounds that are commonly sold as LSD are as follows: 

**2c-x**; these compounds are phenethylamines - related to mescaline 2c-x's are usually in a white crystalline powder. The dose of these substances range from 10 to 50 mg. Not usually in blotter form as the doses are so big, these compounds are usually in a capsule or microdot. 

**25-x-NBOMe**: These are derivatives of the 2c-x class, but are psychoactive in much lower doses. NBOMes will commonly leave a bitter taste in ones mouth if present on a blotter, and will also numb the tongue/cheeck areas. Not much is known about this class of chemicals as they are fairly new to the scene. They have caused some deaths in the USA, and don't seem as safe as it's older relatives to the 2c-xs. The dose range of NBOMe's are anywhere from 500 micrograms to 2 mg on one piece of blotter. 

**DOx**: DOx compounds such as DOI, DOM, and DOB have been around for a while - in the 60's and 70's there was a drug going around called ""STP"" which was in fact DOM. These chemicals are also phenethylamines, and are considered psychedelic amphetamines. These are many times sold on blotters, and effects can last up to 36 hours depending on dose. These tabs will also leave a bitter taste in one's mouth.

Bottom line here, if you get tabs that are bitter - they are a spitter. 
NBOMe's come up within 30 minutes, and can last up to 8 hours. 
DOx's come up usually within 1:30 to 3:00 hours, and can last anywhere from 12 to 36 hours depending on dose. 
2c-x's usually hit within 45 minutes to 1.5 hours, and last anywhere from 4 to 8 hours. 

There seems to be a lot of RC hate on here; which is unfortunate, but due the the spread of bunk acid. Each of these classes of chemicals are quite amazing on their own terms, but do not offer the same safty margin as real LSD. If you find your self with unknown blotters, proceed with caution. There are more chemicals that can fit on blotters that are not on this list, such as some psychedelic tryptamines. But the only reason that someone would sell a chemical on a blotter as LSD is for money, so don't expect so see super rare chems on blotter, because half the time those would cost more to make than what they're being sold as.

I know the LSD game is a hard one, but once you find legit acid - I promise you it will be worth it. It has magic to it. 

All of this is assuming you do not have access to a test kit - if you do, then please use it; as it is pretty fool proof. 
And if you don't have a solid connect, use the silk road.

I saw this on some guy's profile and I thought it would be useful to answer some common questions/concerns people might have:

&gt;
LSD TIPS for Noobs

&gt;-Store LSD in a cool, dark and dry place.

&gt;-Don't mix with antidepressants or antipsychotics(if you're on these, LSD should not be on your bucket list IMHO). You must stop most antidepressants a week or more before your trip. They can either severely blunt or radically intensify your trip, depending on the type of medication you are on.

&gt;-Some people like to fast beforehand to prevent any excessive digestive issues. Some people get a sore stomach, though usually that's because they spent half the night laughing their asses off. I eat, but just a light snack beforehand.

&gt;-Do not consume any beverage containing chlorine a short time before, and for a short time after dropping. LSD is a fragile organic chemical that will break down quickly and easily in the presence of chlorine, leading to a weak or nonexistent trip.
-If you are new to LSD only try one tab of any batch the first time you do it. You can occasionally be surprised at the strength, and until you're experienced enough to randomly dose, I would highly suggest caution.

&gt;-If you trip alone or with others, make certain you will be in a comfortable environment. Don't go hang out at a bar where you're likely going to run into Danny, who really wants to kick your ass for stealing his gurl.

&gt;-LSD trips are often journeys into your own consciousness, what you have fed your mind will come to the surface in interesting and fun ways. Embrace it!

&gt;-Sometimes a trip is just really fun, and more trippy than introspective. Try not to fear that the hallucinations will not go away. Always remind yourself that it's just the drug, and all will be well in a few hours.

&gt;-If you can trip with someone experienced your first time, do it. I personally don't like tripping with non-tripping people though. I find I get this weird complex, like you're on some other plane then they are, that they could never fathom. You also read into what people are saying a little too much sometimes and paranoia can set in. Last, but not least, some straight folks think it's funny to do stupid shit like wave their arms in your face and mutter shit to make you think you're going balls-deep.

&gt;-If you find you are going into a paranoia attack, just leave the room. A change of scenery is often enough to prompt you to calm down and interact with a new environment. I sometimes like to lie down in a dark room. Open eyed, or close eyed, whichever is less crazy, and turn off the music.

&gt;-Some of the worst trips start on the comeup, where you really feel it taking off, and your heart is racing, and if it's a big enough dose you fear you're dying. Don't worry, you won't die, practice breathing slowly... count to ten while breathing in slowly, then breath out slowly and count to 10. This part is not too long usually, and then you can move around and really enjoy what's around you.

&gt;-If you're going to do any other drugs, prep them beforehand... rolling a joint or filling a cap or bongwater is a different experience when tripping balls.

&gt;-For a full list of cautions, check here: https://www.erowid.org/chemicals/lsd/lsd_faq.shtml#cautions

&gt;-HAVE FUN!

1349998853.0,68,self.LSD,11c5ur,I did acid every week for a year and a half.... Here's my story : (xpost r/acid),74,6,60,http://www.reddit.com/r/LSD/comments/11c5ur/i_did_acid_every_week_for_a_year_and_a_half_heres/,"Let me start off by saying I've done acid ALOT... There was about a year to a year and a half run that I did acid every week, and then to add countless drug use (of acid and other substances) years before and during this time as well. It all kind of bleeds together... So here's my acid story, with details from various trips, and from my close friends who were there with me, excerpts from the many nights I traveled down the rabbit hole. 

I've always been able to handle myself well, on heavy doses of any psychedelic. ""Hit me again tube sock!"" I'd say sticking my tongue out, to feel that tingle of another few drops or blots. 
The walls are turning in on themselves, the painted box is melting into the carpet and climbing up to the ceiling, the colors swirling into new ones.  I look over at my friend, their eyes drifting apart, their smile curling on the ends. I feel the carpet beneath me and stroke my fingers across it, feeling so soft, vibrating under me, i feel almost as if I'm on ecstasy.
Clicking through stumble upon, I come across a white page, with rainbows of machines and patterns all working together to create something I can't quiet make out... I refuse to believe its a blank page.  I'm peaking.. Hard. 
I get lost in the luminescent rainbows hanging like a beautiful chandelier from each laser beam dancing on the wall. I grab Kirby and we crawl under the fort/tent we set up ahead of time and start running our hands and feet along the fabric above us.  Laying on our backs we've set sail letting the suspended sheet engulf us fully, swimming in it. Devin and Alex stand above, watching the sheet wave and ripple, confused about what could of caused it. 
Suddenly, it all comes crashing around us. We laugh uncontrollably as we see Psilocybin, our beast of a kitten, fully fluffed, staring at us, scared after trying to attack the sheet and causing the catastrophe. 

I've always felt that when tripping, cat's knew it, and acted differently. 
Psily would pull him self along the carpet with his claws, flipping and acting a fool... Hiding, then running up looking like purple mountain lion ready to eat your face off. Adorable. 

After a while tho, staying home gets boring. And at a rave you just want to isolate yourself so you can get lost in your trip. We'd go for walks or drives. Going round and round the  cul de sac, widows down, dubstep up, the warm sun and cool spring wind on our skin, driving where ever the music takes us. It's getting late, and we're not quiet ready to let our trip go yet... We take the short drive to my friends, and before we know it, I'm watching Lanclose as he takes it straight to the dome. He's on the ground, kneeling, holding his eye open as devin stands above him, smiling as he squeezes the dropper. ""The second the acid was splashing onto my eye, I looked through the drop, and he turned into the devil."" we finished that night of at the bayou... 

Flash forward. We're at the beach, walking along the sand, the waters lapping at our feet, the seaweed scaring the shit out of us as it wraps around our ankles. The stars shimmering. Alex and I wonder off. What else to do on the beach but build a sandcastle. We lived out a whole life there. Named Starbucks. We had teskimo (Texas Eskimos) to work the gates and property, of our resort style castle. I've never had such an emotional connection to a pile of sand in my life. 

But for all the good and fun, there was the bad. Doing acid that much, ou start to feel empty. Soulless.  One week we tripped shrooms... And they were bunk. So the druggy inside of me wasn't satisfied. I typically wait at least 7 days between psychedelics... To let my brain rest... But I wanted to trip. So I figured, why not? And three days later, I did about 3 blots. Everything was fine. A more mild trip than usual, but I felt okay... Until after my peak. I always want more. So, whats a few more hits? Worst idea ever. I quit tripping. Nothing moved nothing was swirling. All the sudden I'm in a prison cell, my brains being smashed to pieces and blended. I sat there, for 3 hours clutching mmy head, crying for the pain to stop.  Counting down the hours till I'm sober again, swearing I'd never do it again. 

And then I sobered up. Waited a couple weeks and got ready to drop again. The life of a druggy... Just cause we got into a little rough patch... I love that crazy girl. 


Ill add that Now I haven't done acid in about 8 months.... And I'm seriously itching to do more.... Sadly all I can find is random drugs being sold as acid. :/

What I wanted to know was how many people working in the various fields of science have had any experience with LSD and other psychedelics. I've heard stories about scientific discoveries inspired by acid trips and its certainly something I can see being true. Some specific questions:

* Have you ever taken a psychedelic? If so, was it in your adolescence or adulthood? Just once, or multiple times?

* Was your interest in science perhaps sparked or fueled by your psychedelic experience? Have psychedelics given you a different perspective on your field of science?

* Was it a positive experience in your life, or do you regret it? (Not to be confused with: ""do you recommend this to others?"" I want to know if tripping was something you are glad you did in *your* life?)

**Just to be clear, I'm not looking for advice on whether to trip, I've already done that plenty, and I'm not trying to encourage anyone else to trip.

1373654498.0,63,self.LSD,1i64tk,LSD has removed my cynical attitude toward children.,76,13,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/LSD/comments/1i64tk/lsd_has_removed_my_cynical_attitude_toward/,"I grew up in a christian home, where the concept of marriage was held very high.  Most of my family is incredibly monogamous (very committed and don't date casually i.e. searching for a life partner).  I was taught that one day I would get married and have kids and raise them like my parents raised me.  Most of my adolescence was spent thinking about and trying to find my significant other so that I could settle down and have kids one day. 

As I grew older, my parent's marriage worsened.  As far as bad relationships go, they were about an 8/10.  It was to the point where it was absolute hell to live at home and be around my parents together for any amount of time at all.  FINALLY, after a drawn out marriage and a lot of counseling, my parents got divorced and now live completely separate lives, which has made things much better.  I also went through the process of losing my faith in christianity and becoming an athiest (which I now am).  

Losing my faith and my parents marriage gave me a very cynical attitude toward marriage and the idea of monogamy, as well as the idea of even raising kids.  I also used to work at a summer camp as a counselor where I would deal with other people's kids all day.  This gave me a newfound cynicism for children themselves, and I often would think that I wanted to be a bachelor for life, and never have to ""deal with"" raising kids.  

This all continued on until I took some LSD with a few friends at my house.  The trip came on, and we all had a good time, good visuals, good conversation, etc.....  On the comedown (my favorite part) I was sitting with my friend talking about life (he was not tripping).  He was talking about college and his major in economics and how he didn't want kids right away and maybe never because of the financial strain that it would put on him.  He said that he would have a much better time without kids and more money to spend on himself.  

After he said this, I was suddenly flooded with a realization that I had never had fully before.  I looked back on my life, and I imagined a younger version my father saying the exact same thing my friend just said.  I imagined myself never existing, and I saw my father living his whole entire life without kids, buying things for himself, living for himself.  Then I thought about the fact that my father DIDN'T do that, and because of this, I was sitting on the couch experiencing the universe at that EXACT moment.  This realization hit me so hard, that I was simply a result of my fathers decision to have children, and I thought about my own perceptions of children and marriage.  I saw myself old and dying, without any kids, looking back on my life and realizing that I had never created anything.  I saw myself getting a job, making money, and being in perpetual misery.  I thought about the opportunity to pass life on, and how the universe has GIVEN us this opportunity.  What kind of person is given the opportunity to reproduce, and chooses to say, ""fuck it, I'd rather have more green paper and stuff.""  It made all the hard work, the financial strain, the lack of freedom, and the stress of parenting all seem worth it.

This led me into a long conversation with my friend about kids, and ended up with us saying, ""of course I'm going to fucking have kids, what greater thing is there in life?""

I now have a deeper appreciation for the idea of parenting and raising kids than I have never had before.  Just thought this was a cool story of one of the many psychological ""gems"" that you can receive from LSD.  


EDIT:  I am in no way arguing that everyone should have kids; i agree, that kids aren't for everyone.  I am more trying to outline how my cynical attitude changed toward kids and raising kids in general.  You can never want to have kids but still respect and not be cynical of children themselves.

At their best, they seem to offer the keys to the universe but after 40 years involvement, I've yet to meet someone who reached enlightenment on them in any sort of lasting way.  Still, I'm endlessly thankful for how they opened my mind.  I'm very heartened by much of what I read in this sub.  

Also, though, I read too many accounts in this sub of young people taking such large doses that it appears they're trying to obliterate their sense of self and reality.  This is a dangerous path that in the long run never leads to a good place, in my long experience with psychedelics and psychedelics users.  

Freedom from self isn't getting away from the person in your head that you don't really like, the sober person with all your hang-ups and issues.  Freedom from self is a gradually-learned freedom from the compulsive, automatic belief that the complex of thoughts and feelings you call 'me' is real and continuous.  Getting so high that this complex falls apart for a few hours is like cleaning house with a fire hose.  It rarely leads to the product you're seeking; a strong, light, spontaneous, uninhibited and capable person who's up for anything.  And yet, psychedelics can introduce you to the core of your being that fits that description perfectly--maybe for the first time, surprising you entirely. 

In more practical terms, I guess I'd say this: if you're finding yourself in thought-loops, or often confused and slipping from scene to scene in a dreamlike way, cut back your dose.  It might not seem like such a roller-coaster ride, but you stand a better chance of bringing about a lasting transformation of your perspective, and a lasting sense of empowerment.

Peace

I had heard that they go together suitably, but there was no way to predict just how well. This was one of those lifetime peaks you look back on as a reminder of what's possible. 

If you've smoked DMT before, you know that it can be an intense and sometimes scary experience. Tripping on acid, however, put me in the perfect state of confident peace. Smoking the DMT felt absolutely right. 

Sure enough, with the sounds of the playa whistling around my tent, I lit the bowl. Within seconds I was brought to the gates of the crystal palace. Color is suddenly revealed for the first time. What I experience as color in my normal day to day is actually merely a blueprint for the real deal, something streaming to me now as an entirely enclosed snow globe of realer than real peace. Beings lay down lessons upon me. Yes, it is entirely possible to be utterly free of burdens. I let out a sound I've never made before, a crude token of my appreciation. This is caviar for the mind, a cherry on top of the great pyramid. It's over as soon as it began.

My close friend has done it a handful of times and was always telling me that it was probably the best experience of his life. I don't know why I felt that it was something I should stay away from. It was probably because of the name ""acid"" that makes people turn away. 
Anyway, my first time was 5 days ago. It was me, my close friend that I mentioned earlier, and 3 other people that I knew and liked. I was nervous the whole car ride while getting it, even though they kept commenting,""In less than one hour we are going to be having the time of our lives.."" All of them have tripped before. I had already done Molly and was a pretty frequent toker, but I never thought of trying Lucy. 
The whole day was planned out really well. I told my mom I was going to Six Flags so that I had an excuse to have my phone off. I took all the precautions with me before leaving. 
When we got the LSD we went to a forest. I had 2.5 tabs and everyone else had 3. We smoked a couple bowls and waited for the journey to begin. Almost 30 minutes had gone by and I felt a connection towards nature. I've always loved nature, but this time I felt much closer to it, a sort of connection you feel towards people. I respected it. All of a sudden, the visuals started to come. I started to look at a tree and notice different ways of looking at it. We started walking and everything felt like an adventure. We all would stop to pick up a rock or stare at a log. 
We peaked right when we got to this hill that had a pond. It was amazing. We listened to trance music and just enjoyed the Earth and everything it had to offer. I would lay in the grass as it hugged my whole body, like a big hug. 
That's just parts of what happened, but all in all my conclusion is that taking LSD was probably one of the best decisions ever. I don't know why people don't take it. I couldn't think of a negative thought the whole time. If people weren't so judgmental, they would learn to enjoy things.

We've tripped together on shrooms, LSD, weed, meditation, and extacy, respectively.
 I feel that the indescribable connections one always makes with one's friends during a trip are magnified by the fact that we are in love and sleeping together. We're perfectly in sync, put each other first, express affection freely- basically we've advanced our level of intimacy to a point I feel would normally take years to achieve, but we've only been together a few months. We're aware of each other all the time, even when we're apart, but we're not overly clingy or co-dependent. For example, today I saw him from a distance walking across campus and I silently called to him with a smile, and he instantly turned and waved. We both knew and understood in that moment that we missed each other but we both had shit to do, but we'd be thinking of each other until we're together again.

1371529019.0,58,self.LSD,1gkd5x,"I wrote a beginner's guide to enjoying a trip (good or bad) for /r/drugs about a year ago, but I think it's appropriate for here too. [Edited and updated]",64,6,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/LSD/comments/1gkd5x/i_wrote_a_beginners_guide_to_enjoying_a_trip_good/,"To be clear, I'm not going to give advice on dosages, because not only does it vary from person to person, but I'm no expert and am in no position to give advice in that regard. This guide will be a sort of how to on how to deal  with the experience on a personal and psychological level. 

**When and where to take acid**

I personally wont trip with people  who aren't also tripping. I might low dose at a party - just enough to get  giggly and see some colour shifts and breathing walls, but if I plan on having an adventure I'll either do it alone or with fellow trippers.There's nothing more counter-productive to a good trip than a group of drunken friends making fun of you for enjoying the experience. It makes you restrain yourself and inhibits our imagination. Be in an open and accepting environment where you're free to trip balls, talk philosophical shit and enjoy the experience. 

A trip sitter can be handy (thanks AnagramsOnly), a sober person to guide you can be a Godsend on your first time. It's easy in  the thick of a trip to forget all you've learned about your ability to control it and it could be great to have an experienced tripper you respect and who respects you to remind you that it's your journey and you choose where you go.

It doesn't hurt to have a couple of valium in your pocket, either. Just knowing that you can exit the trip at any time will give you the confidence to move through any discomfort. Chances are, you'll never use them.

**When it starts to kick**

So you've taken some acid and whenever you blink you're seeing shapes and colours. Now is the time to feel excited. You're about to take a journey. Some journeys are bright, euphoric and elated while others are dark and scary. All journeys are mind blowing and an opportunity to learn about yourself.

The key is not to get scared. Everything around you is a TV show to be observed and enjoyed. Nothing can hurt you. If things take a dark turn, take a step back and watch it like a scary movie. Get excited about what is coming and await that next scare with unbridled anticipation. You've paid good money for this show and you'd be disappointed if it were predictable.

If the experience is enjoyable (99% of them will be) then soak it in. Remember that it is your mind creating these images and you have ultimate control over what you see should you choose to embrace it. Stare into the night sky. Watch the colours dance. Focus your energy on increasing the intensity. Make a conscious decision to like what you see and power it up. Focus is key. Dancing lights in the sky can become intricate and beautiful fireworks with a little will power.

If it is not enjoyable, remember it's your tv.You hold the remote. never listen to anyone that says if you have a bad trip you're stuck in it until it ends, because you're not. You have the power within you to choose what you see. Make fun of the bad things until they become funny and before you know it you will only see funny things. Remember nothing can hurt you and everything strengthens you. If things get out of control then hug someone or take a walk. 

Never be in a situation where you feel like it's not ok to talk about what you're seeing, good or bad. If you're amongst fellow trippers who are good friends then talking to them will soothe and enlighten you. Share your experience.. After all, you're all just exploring different parts of the same world. 

**Shit's getting intense**

No matter where you turn or what you do, there are visuals everywhere. You can't even tell if your hands are clean or dirty at this point because too much is going on in front of them.

Immerse yourself. You are on a spectral plane. You are a shaman visiting a different realm. 99% of people will never be on the plane of experience you are on, soak it up and enjoy it. Fighting it doesn't work and will only make you tense and anxious. Accept everything you see with a smile. Appreciate it all as artworks specifically created for you in an exhibition nobody else will ever see. A safe environment is key. Be in good company in a good location. You are a baby opening his eyes for the first time. Everything you see is new, amazing and totally inexplicable.. But that doesn't matter. Give in to astonishment and enjoy the ride while it lasts, because it will unfortunately come to an end.

**I'm coming down**

After a long time of tripping balls your mind and body are exhausted. you want to rest and need to sleep, but whenever you close your eyes fractals and pictures assault your senses. It feels like it should be over and it isn't. You're starting to feel like it will never end and you're trapped here forever. Remember that it is impossible to get stuck in a trip. Physically impossible. Find a nice quiet place to lie down and put on some music or tv. Nature documentaries are perfect. The serene voice of the narrator calms you and the interesting information he presents gives your tripping mind something to focus on. For the first few hours it may be hard to see the picture clearly because you're still on the astral plane, but as time passes the visions will dim. You'll notice patterns on curtains and carpets stop dancing and instead they take deep breaths. The trip is wearing off and you're entering the afterglow.

**The afterglow**

You're fully lucid again. Walls may still be breathing, but your mind is back to normal. This time is precious. You can still remember in vivid detail everything you saw. Unfortunately our brains aren't designed to hold all this information and these memories will become foggy with time. Use this time to reflect and marvel at what you've been lucky enough to see. Sit and remember the fantastic, crisp visions and intense hallucinations. Learn from yourself. Be proud of your boundless and unbridled imagination. Be proud of your unharnessed creativity.

**The coming days and weeks**

If you tripped hard enough you probably feel no desire to do it again for a while. You feel you've gained all you can from the trip and may assume you never need to do it again. As the days and weeks pass, the memories become foggier and you yearn to experience the magical world of your subconscious once again.

Go back to step one. Find a safe place in good company and enjoy the ride.

**Non-visual effects, and how to deal with them** (thanks /u/10ne)

Everything written so far is applicable to non-visual sensations, but I'll go over some of them specifically. Certain strange thought processes and effects can occur while tripping, and it's good to know that they're normal and manageable. 

* Looping - Often you'll find yourself repeating the same thought over and over again. It could be a sentence, a song lyric, a concept, an emotion or a hallucination. This can be frustrating and sometimes scary - other times it can be quite enjoyable. Like everything else, it is within your control. To fix looping, try doing something else. If you're walking around in nature, try going inside and putting on some music. If you're sitting inside listening to music, try going for a walk outside. Change your physical behavior and your mental state should follow. Sometimes it just means you've been alone with your thoughts for too long without any new stimulation. Try talking to someone or watching some TV.

* Disorientation - Again, this is normal and it's worse for some people than others. I get really disoriented. I find myself lost in places I've been a hundred times or if I've taken far too much, I may find it difficult to find my way out of a small room with only one door. This can cause panic and frustration, but it's cool. You can deal with it. If you find yourself disoriented, stop, take a deep breath and take a slow look around. Collect yourself for a moment instead of panicking. It's super unlikely that you're actually trapped or lost, you just need a second to get yourself together. It's best to trip somewhere safe, familiar and friendly.

* Lack of focus - While tripping, it can be hard to follow conversations or TV shows for extended periods of time. This is just because you're a lot more introspective than usual, and it's fine. If you're tripping with friends, just tell them that you're having trouble focusing. They'll be cool with it. Remember, they're high too and they're probably feeling the same effect to some degree. They'll get it. Never be afraid to tell anyone around you what's going on in your head. On that note, don't trip with anyone you wouldn't feel comfortable expressing yourself to.

* Freaking out - This is rare, but it happens. Like I said earlier, you can't get stuck in a trip but it's easy to forget that when your perception of time is messed up and it feels like you've been high for an eternity. Check the clock, most of the time you'll see that it hasn't been that long. Try and get yourself excited about how much more time you have with this amazing experience.

* Needing to be alone - I get like this sometimes. For a lot of people, the experience is so intense that they just need a moment to deal with it on their own, without the added pressure of social interaction. That's cool. Just tell your friends your going inside to watch some TV for a bit. If you're going to be alone, turn on the TV. It gives you a nice, low intensity focus point while you gather yourself together.",,False,,t5_2qhvj,1371556240.0,,,True,t3_1gkd5x,http://www.reddit.com/r/LSD/comments/1gkd5x/i_wrote_a_beginners_guide_to_enjoying_a_trip_good/,

for me, i had always been critical of myself since grade 8, when i realized i had a big nose. it sounds dumb, but it became my obsession, constantly wishing my nose was normal, doing research related to nose surgery etc. it developed into an extremely irrational thing for me, and before long that way of thinking leaked into other parts of my body and my confidence was gone. i hated myself for the way i looked, and that reflected in my actions. i didn't try acid until about 4-5 years later, with a group of my closest friends. i was listening to pink floyd (cliche i know) and i started realizing that i didn't look as ugly as i thought i did, and that i was being unrealistic in thinking i should change who i am or how i look to impress others. 

since then ( over the course of 11 months ) my life has improved drastically. my confidence has grown immensely. i can talk to people and joke around, not caring how i look or what i say. i feel more like my old self, i can feel my creative juices flowing more and i reflect that into my art and my music. i don't get angry as often. i haven't had one fight with my parents. i feel calm and relaxed in social settings/ sometimes uncomfortable situations. i love who i am, and am proud of myself. goodbye depression and anxiety, you will be forgotten and may you never resurface.

Probably once a week or a little less now, and its good I guess, but it just got a bit ""samey"" and mechanical and I guess the magic of it all was starting to fade a bit. It was more ""having sex for the sake of having sex"". We still obviously love each other heaps. But its been a bit of an elephant in the room, that its not happening that often anymore (and I just couldnt figure out why. It was more my problem than hers).

So we went to a private hippie festival this weekend and obviously got straight on the acid and MDMA. While we were sitting in our camper van sucking nitrous bulbs, my gf looked at me and had somewhat of an epiphany.

She was like, we are open with each other and we are totally fucked up. She said she has figured out a way to ""fix"" our problem. Lets just get on the stuff and fuck like animals basically. And fuck we did. No holds barred. Anything goes. Any hole's a goal etc. 

I dont know, but having sex with someone you love while you are both tripping balls is just out of this world. You experience a connection that is usually very hard to experience when you are both sober. We both rekindled our love for each other and it feels like new love all over again. 

We have pretty much gone from having sex once every 2 weeks to fucking every day. And it has been great. 

I just thought I should mention this. If things are getting a bit stale. Take acid /mdma with your partner and fuck her like an animal. It is truly amazing. 

I never thought LSD would be used for sexual issues, but even now, long after the effects have worn off, we cant keep our hands off each other. 

If you are having problems like I did. Try this out. I honestly think it allows you to connect on a level that would otherwise be really difficult to achieve.

Thought you guys might enjoy hearing about it.",55,6,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/LSD/comments/12szlz/i_had_a_pretty_fantastic_time_dropping_acid_for/,"So my best friend (A), his stepbrother (B), and my girlfriend (K) and I are getting together to hang out, nothing new. B knows where to buy acid, yay! A and I both have twenty bucks a piece, which is enough to get one hit each (I know that sounds expensive, but shit like that is really hard to come by where we live and we didn't want to miss our chance of getting some). K didn't buy any because she felt it wasn't a great time for her/she didn't have much interest in it. Plus she had to go to work in the morning. 

B had some yesterday and he assured us it was good stuff, telling us about his inter-county bicycle adventure. We go downtown, buy some, and head to a party that B was talking about earlier. We all take our hits as we drive to the party. We had a ways to go, so by the time we arrived, the acid began to do its thing. Just the little stuff though. 

Things became more apparent and ""real"" if you will. I kinda had that invincible feeling with an intense focus on everything. Its like my brain was beginning to fully function for once. I have pretty bad add but acid pretty much threw that out the window for the time being.
 
A, B, and I were in an ocean of drunk people. We were just on a totally different plain of consciousness than them. The contrast in state-of-minds was pretty astounding. It was pretty funny to us. I didn't know anybody there, but I had a lot of fun just going around and fearlessly socializing. I felt fucking great. Not quite tripping out yet, but just feeling super duper.

And then things got a little more ""trippy"", just slightly. I saw a clock hanging on the wall. I was just amazed by that fucking clock. I was amazed by what clocks were, the mechanics, what we use it for, the concept of time, etc. Then this dude stumbles over and asks if I'm on shrooms and I said ""No man, acid!"" And he was just like ""Fuck yeah man!!"" and high fives me and walks away.

More stuff happens, blah blah, and soon K wants to leave because she's bored and moody because of her birth control shots she was taking at the time. So I walk her to her car to say bye, and sit in the passenger seat because she is trying to talk to me. She explains that she has work the next morning and she has to get up really early, but wants me to leave and sleep over at her house. I'm trying to tell her that I am starting to trip, that wouldn't be a good idea because I would be trapped in her room at her house and sleeping on acid just doesn't happen. Plus we would have to get up extra early so she could drop me off at home that morning. Not very cool. But she doesn't care. Her hormones are all out of whack and reasoning with her is just impossible. She even starts crying a little bit. What the hell, are you really going to do this to me right now??? As she's going on and on, I start to REALLY feel it. Things outside are getting wiggly and ""breathing"". Whenever I tried to repond to her, my choice of words are pretty strange and doesn't really seem to be on the same page as me.

 Then her dashboard caught my attention. Beautiful, shiny, smooth stained wood finish (it's actually black plastic) just captivated me. I was caressing it and feeling it with my amazing hands that FELT things. Just thinking about feeling all these great things in the world just excited me so much that I began to giggle. K is pretty puzzled by this, but after I explain myself, she thinks it's pretty funny and I finally convince her that it would be a bad idea to take me home. '

She finally leaves and stops trying to argue with me. Now I am REALLY there. It took like forty minutes to get her to just leave me and the party is pretty much over. The host, A, B, another dude and some chick are all standing around the fire out back. I had my acoustic bass there but I couldn't find it so I go in to find it with A. Turns out the host's dad had it somewhere because he saw it and didn't want some drunk jack ass to mess it up and tells us that he too is a musician. A and I have been playing together and in various bands since early high school and we just talking to him about guitars and music and such. He eventually invites us to see his guitar room and check out his collection. Little did we know about what we were about to get ourselves into.

All over the walls there were guitars and basses, all of which were $900 plus. Gibsons, Fenders, PRSs were the primary choice of this collector. Not to mention the Pearl drum set in the corner and all the amps there too. He gives us the ok to play and we have at it. 

A is my best friend and we fit remarkably well for each other when it comes to jamming. We have been playing and writing music with each other for a very long time. He shreds on guitar and I hold it down on the bass. I have to say, the LSD we took really brought us to a new level of musical understanding and on top of that, the quality of the instruments made our playing so effortless and we could literally play anything that came to us. Music is our number one passion and being able to fully embrace it on LSD was one of the greatest feelings and eye opening experiences in my life.

So we are sitting there just jamming out and the host and his dad are pretty blown away by what we are playing. It was all complete improv, but the only way I could possible describe it was progressive rock jazz fusion. I'm not trying to toot my own horn here, but you had to hear it to understand. It was pretty fucking awesome.

 Host's dad was very impressed and he offered to smoke us out with some FRESH WEED FROM HIS GROW ROOM. We smoked and things just got insane. The trip at this point was definitely at its peak and host's dad got behind those drums and we pretty much rocked out until 4 am. Afterwards he gave us a couple of beers (I don't know if he knew we were tripping our balls off the whole entire time) and we eventually left to come down from it all at A's house. We don't even know where B went but he returned the next day hahaha. 

We couldn't really sleep due to heavy closed eye visuals, but we eventually dozed off. 

It was fucking awesome. Doing all of that on acid was just a dream come true for me. It was such a beautiful experience.",,False,,t5_2qhvj,False,,,True,t3_12szlz,http://www.reddit.com/r/LSD/comments/12szlz/i_had_a_pretty_fantastic_time_dropping_acid_for/,

The place was astoundingly beautiful and we had absolutely no neighbors!! Not a single person in sight and this whole massive amazing ocean in front of us. We dropped approximately 300ug of LSD tabs at 9PM (2 x 120ug Hoffmans from Jerseycow and a 50ug Gandalf). 

We sat on the patio overlooking the ocean, waiting for the come up, and laughed as we became increasingly more euphoric and English started seeming foreign. Everyone tried to speak but couldn't mouth the words. We were all feeling the same thing and trying to express to each other that words weren't necessary...we were in that invisible dimension, the dimension that Lucy gives you front row seats to, you know the one, you're smiling right now thinking of it. :)

We had prepped a beach bag before we dropped the acid but in our excitement and with a surge of energy we found ourselves running toward the ocean with nothing but the clothes on our backs and a tiny amount of water. The apartment is situated on a hill and there are a billion slippery steps to get to the beach. It was really hilarious trying to climb down the steps...I held onto the railings for dear life and walked a step at time feeling like I was climbing a mountain. I don't know how we managed it, but we ended up on the moonlit beach and stood there taking it in...my thoughts were abstract but it was melding into the ocean perfectly...I walked further and further into it and felt so oddly warmed by the cold water. There's so much energy coming from the ocean, so much life existing within it...it's like a universe on its own...we played on the beach with no regard for how wet we would be or how sandy we would become, twirling and falling in the sand, awakened and truly alive. Our souls were melting into the brilliant sea. 

We decided to go back to the apartment and had a few moments of panic as we realized the turnstiles were not responding to our key card...we were locked in, we had no food, more importantly we had no water. It was horrifying and funny at the same time. All the water in the world, and not a drop to drink! We got into survival mode instantly. Count our resources, divide the rations, devise a survival plan. haha. I felt like I was ship-wrecked and loved how my brain kicked into action mode so quickly. We wouldn't see a single soul for another 12 hours! That's when the life guard would get in. 12 hours on LSD feels like an eternity! I observed how incredibly at peace I was at the thought of being stuck on the beach. I felt open to the adventure and willing to see the bright side! If I wasn't on LSD, I'd probably be focused on how uncomfortably wet, cold, sandy and thirsty I felt.

We found a way to escape the beach and almost got lost but found our way back to our apartment and got clean and comfy again...spent time talking, listening to music, playing with laser lights and enjoying the view of the ocean and city lights from the patio. I felt this eye staring at me off in the distance, it was teasingly looking in at me, a familiar eye, I think of it as the all-seeing eye or my own consciousness staring back at me...and I wanted to melt into it, just get lost in it forever, but my friends wouldn't let me sink in...they kept engaging me in conversation or doing fun stuff that distracted me from it...which I thoroughly enjoyed too...I really really wanted to go to that place though, be inside that shiny eye...it's a place where I lose my ego and strip myself from all my pain...it's a place where no one can hurt me...it doesn't bother me that I'm imperfect or that I haven't achieved everything I wanted to achieve...it doesn't bother me that there's violence on our planet and suffering...it's a place where I can just let it be and completely understand that it has to be that way. I usually strip myself apart when I go there and then put myself back together when I come back to earth, and then it feels so great to be alive! As I indulge my friends in activities, dancing, conversing and playing with colorful things, I notice shadows, movement, this thing...it chases me...teases me...begs me to come inside...it gives me an adrenaline rush...I feel nervous because it's unfamiliar and familiar all at once...I don't know if anyone else experiences this...it's like an unknown dimension that I seem to get a peek into. It's beautiful there. When I sink into it, I have the most gorgeous visions of evolution, life, and possibilities of other intelligent beings and dimensions or alternate realities...I melt into egos of other people, people from history, people here now, and people from the future, people that don't look like human poeple, people I've never met but I feel like I know them, because I am them. I feel appreciation for every living thing that ever was because I know they all contributed to my existence today. I can see communities and infrastructures being developed, people dying and suffering but in their death, giving us a chance to live longer as technology and science learnt from them. People falling in love, hurting, laughing, living, feeling...I can be in a billion peoples minds all at once. Of course I'm not sure that any of it is real...but it gives me such a big appreciation for life that I don't care if it's all in my head. 

The sun races us! 

Day was breaking and we were trying to get dressed for the beach and get to it on time to watch the sun rise...we felt like we were racing the sun trying to see who gets to the beach first! We actually managed to make it. We were happy to find that some strangers had molded a beach bed in the sand, with back rests. We lay a bed sheet on our beach bed and lay back waiting for the sun to come up...it was amazing!! The sun was glowing in kaleidoscopic colors making the ocean glisten in rainbows...it looked so inviting...we had to get closer. 

We stood in the water thinking that the ocean is a ""she"", as she kicked our butts and dropped us to the floor and washed away our pain, cleaned us up and told us of abundance, joy, pain, love, life, feeesh, so much feeeesh, evolution, beauty, wonder, mystery. She will sustain life, she will take it away too. She will be temperamental, she will comfort us too. We were enveloped in joy and energized by the 4 elements, the sand (earth) at our feet, burying us deep and keeping us rooted, the water from the ocean tossing us around and playfully telling us she loves us, the wind at our backs cooling us down and dancing on our skin, the sun warming us up, filling our world with color and light...I couldn't have felt more alive than in that moment, watching the sun rise on this beautiful beach. 

When people started arriving at the beach, I couldn't help but notice how purely beautiful they all were. Every person looked stunningly, amazingly, beautiful and I felt love, peace and serenity with everything in our universe...

Here's some pics of our adventure land: http://imgur.com/a/T2w0s#0 *edit* - added a few more pics since people seem to really dig the place...thought I'd show you more of the apartment and a few more beach pics.

Hopefully all of this will help me figure out.. everything.  Also, first-timers might be interested to read too, since these are my first two times.

First I want to talk about my first time tripping.  A few weekends ago I decided to try it with two close friends.. we took two hits each.  Turns out they were mic'd at 200-250 μg each... so that was 400-500μg my first time.  One of the more scary / strange psychological experiences I've ever had.  At first it was pretty cool... I was nervously excited about the whole thing.  I was really liking the music, enjoying the slightly altered state of mind, how everything felt, how textures on the most plain objects and things popped out, it was like I was seeing the world in an entirely different mode of thought (which I was).

And then my friend put on some of the darkest dubstep I'd ever heard.  The acid kicked in too, and I was gone.  I felt myself dissolve: I forgot how to really communicate, how to draw (the main reason I wanted to try acid), how to move my legs, how to text; I simply lost feeling.  It was insane.  I then dissolved out of the room and started hallucinating: I saw what I perceived to be the end of the universe (which turned out to be a pile of my drunk friend's vomit; this did not help at all)... I kept on popping in and out, attempting to use ""mind traps"" to control my ""mind loops"" and ""time-travel"" so I didn't have to experience the end of the universe again.  I wanted to tell my girlfriend so bad yet I didn't know what to say and I was depressed to think I might never see her again.

Everything was kaleidoscoping... I saw the universe as a collection of all possible decisions I could ever make, a rotating mess of different realities and choices, and they were all converging on this one point.  I thought I would always be tripping; that acid was everything, creativity, that I could run away across the country and it wouldn't matter since the universe was coming to an end in a trash can. Some parts were AMAZING amongst this mess.. I heard some music like I never had before, I felt it course throughout me and run through my senses like a stampede of wild animals.  The stimuli of a bunch of drunk people bothering me, trying to comfort me and my hallucinations, however, did not help at all: I kept on losing myself in and out of the trip until I accepted the end of the universe, accepted my place in it, accepted the depressing circumstances I was in as perpetual and inevitable, and accepted myself as being locked in this place forever.  It was the most unsettling experience in my whole life.  Needless to say 10 hours in my mind was tired and I just wanted everything to stop.  I took the two hits at 7:30 and 8:30pm.. by 4am the carpet was still glowing and the hallways I was in were twisted. Bleh.


**After** weeks of pondering this first trip, I came to the conclusion that acid is insanity.  I couldn't see it any other way based on what I had experienced.

But then I suggested when my girlfriend of 2 years came to visit me this weekend (we hadn't seen each other in 2 months; 3000 miles apart) that we candy flip because maybe with her things would be different.  And I wanted to try candy flipping.  She had never done anything besides drink and smoke weed (neither had I until many weekends before).  She was down though, so we decided to go through with it.

We took 250 μg at 9:30pm, and 2 points of MDMA at 10:30pm.  So it was my second time this past weekend taking acid, first time MDMA.  We were excited as hell, and intimate as fuck because we hadn't seen each other in so long.

I'll say right now that this past weekend has changed our relationship, in the best way possible.  **I can't even begin to explain how amazing this experience was, and how profound of an effect it has had on us.**  It started off again with a nervous excitement, except this time we were listening to mellower music instead of dubstep (m83, Cut Copy, Passion Pit, Temper Trap, Phoenix... even Lady Gaga). We were lying on my bed naked together, hooking up, being intimate, and we started feeling strange; that strange sense that your mind is slowly expanding, an entirely new feeling you really can't explain until you've tripped.

And **just like that,** we were together.  We were on the exact same wavelength; our vibes intertwined and formed into one; and we were understanding each other on a whole new level.  I was asking her how she was feeling, and she was seeing an ocean in the plywood planks that kept the bunk above from falling.  I watched her eyes twitch back and forth as she started to experience something she had never felt before.  **And then we fell into each other.**  Literally.. we couldn't tell whose body was whose; we forgot who one another was and we were simply one.  We were no longer separate entities, but something else entirely.  We had tripped and fell into each other.  This persisted for two hours... we were each other, and I don't really remember anything besides the feeling of being enveloped inside of the love of my life.  Though I was confused as hell, it was the most comforting, serene feeling I've ever felt.  And she experienced the exact same thing.  Unexplainable.  Perfect.  The music was intense and immense during this period; [Kim and Jessie by m83](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9yvItZAjfY) played and I felt completely encased in the music; the lyrics were perfect and I felt like everything was perfect and always would be.

We came out of this trance around 1:00am (maybe.. time wasn't making sense) and we were confused and unsettled; not used to being separate physical entities again, not used to the massive flux of information running through our brains and the stimuli that were still affecting us greatly. Yet it felt so right.  We kept messing up the pronouns You, I, and Us (and did the rest of the day)... they were practically interchangeable.  We were talking (most likely blabber to most people, as we were both confused about what we were experiencing), trying to figure out us, the drug, what we were doing.. and we understood each other like we never have before.  I was finishing her acid thoughts, and she mine.  It was surreal.  We talked until we sort of stopped feeling major effects at about 9:00am.",,False,,t5_2qhvj,True,,,True,t3_g5o0i,http://www.reddit.com/r/LSD/comments/g5o0i/i_didnt_know_one_weekend_could_change_everything/,

1) buy a case of your favorite soda, preferably a colorful one (drink from a classy decorative glass which would twinkle when held up to the light)
2) disco ball/laser lights/christmas lights or any other nifty lighting effects
3) prepare a playlist with positive &amp; uplifting music
4) have a movie on standby just in case if reality gets too real for you to handle. (i suggest the holy mountain or the fountain)
5) pot, at least a gram for yourself (or enough for the evening and the day after to help ease your mind)
6) drawing paper &amp; utensils
7) hit up your local library for some art books (i highly suggest monet while tripping, alex grey is cool too)
8) your favorite incense, or a mix of fragrances you like (shine laser lights through smoke to blow your mind)
9) have a packet of food coloring, drip some into a glass of water &amp; enjoy the show
10) double up on socks, your feet will get cold. wear your favorite pj's
11) turn your phone off, you'll be okay. if you are opposed to this &amp; want any 'help', keep a very close friend on retainer as a 'sitter' to ensure the emotional stability of your trip.
12) go out for a walk, appreciate nature
13) ""HD vision sunglasses""
14) don't order pizza during the come up, it might arrive in the next dimension
15) take a shower while tripping, observe every individual drop of water recollect around your feet
16) write journal entries &amp; keep a time log
17) don't fear the mirror, it is you who observes
18) look through an old photo album
19) watch this video
20) as a sign of good faith, i would like to personally tell all of you that ""you, alone &amp; together, exist within the universe of beauty""

But i was excited for my first time trying acid, with my best friend, in her house, and her parents were cool with it. I expected something along the lines of my shroom trip visually; Stuff like breathing walls, morphing faces, etc. But it turns out I was way off! There were hardly any visuals, which I partly contribute to the fact that I take Zoloft, but it was still an incredibly mind-bending experience. We dropped at 11am, and by noon I was definitely feeling something. The only thing was that I didn't even understand how much further I could go! I thought that was it, I thought that since an hour had passed this would be it. But I just kept going deeper and deeper into the rabbit hole and I didn't even know it until I looked back. Every minute stretched into an hour. And between extreme fits of laughter and orgasmic music and tangerines I was just about having the best damn time of my life. I thought I would encounter at least a little anxiety, maybe it would be too intense, but nothing. Just pure, childhood bliss. The only thing I regret is that its winter. I wish I could have had more daylight as the trip extended into the darkness (around 5pm) and had a definite impact on the overall mood. It wasn't scary per say, just....gloomy? No no that's not right either. Just....dark. That's the only way to describe it. So, my conclusion is simple, wait until the summer, wake up early, and do that shit again! Fucking mind blowing!

EDIT: just felt like adding something. There was a part of the trip where my best friend and I were drawing with markers, and she accidentally got some on her hand. we then proceeded to draw on each other. I would draw on her arm, and use my arm to spread the color around onto both of us. It should be noted we have been friends for a very long time, but that particular experience was amazing because we literally felt like we were connecting very deeply. Throughout the rest of the trip, if we felt we were losing touch with one another, we simply took a marker and re-connected. It was pretty darn cool!

I am what I would consider ultra experienced, tripped hundreds of times (largely, not always, on the road with the Dead) no LSD (only organics, shrooms, peyote) since the early 80's.   Is it still just as strong?  I remember taking some Owsley shit that took me 3 days, didn't peak 'til well into the second day.  In the ""old days"" there was no dosage control to speak of, you just dropped and went for the ride.  Is it still like that?

In my time on reddit i have seen lots of out there stuff, but there's one thing in particular that gives me great concern...and that is the use of reddit while under the influence of trip-able goods, especially when it comes to setting preferences.  As a seasoned traveler browsing this sub, I have an observations/questions.

I cannot fathom why anyone would want to trip or spend the significant portion of their trip in front of the computer.  I can appreciate being able to find vast amounts of new music or information, but it pains me to see people doing this. I myself have left my phone off or with someone I trust many times after seeing what a distraction and weird concept it could be.

I have a sneaking suspicion that anxiously awaiting to see if you've gained karma or to see if someone replies to one of your comments is detrimental to the trip and i view it as a waste of the human experience.  go out and experience some of the cool things you saw on reddit in real life.  get spun in a rainstorm, draw your hands, collect the coolest leaf or pebbles you can find, make some new four-legged or winged friends.

don't get me wrong, I spend alot of my time in front of glowing rectangles, perhaps too much...but when exploring the depths of our minds, and the subsequent beauty that can be discovered or found once again, I feel it best to be in a place with little to no technological distractions, or have such a place nearby(festival and concert trippers, this is a valuable lesson). 

does anyone else feel this way?

About a month ago, some friends and I purchased a 10 strip, each of us took 2 hits. We were at a friends house and let me tell you, this was the best possible place to trip. My friends parents who owned the house are extremely conservative (they have pictures of the george bush family all over their refrigerator) yet they have a large collection of artifacts and art from around the world. My friend who lives there is a very successful naval officer who works on Oil tankers in the Indian Ocean. He didn't take any because he's in the navy, he just enjoys drinking and watching us trip. He told us to feel free to look around the house and touch and examine what ever you want. I wonder down to the basement as i begin to feel the effects kick in. Downstairs one of my friends and i discover this huge wall covered with all sorts of old books. We're talking about National Geographic books dating back to 1918 up to 1975. I am speechless! We read these for a good while and then discover a really old Encyclopedia Britannica (we couldn't find a date in it, but we could tell it was old because there were some characters we were not familiar with.) Now I'm a huge music fanatic and I like to research why humans find music so interesting and how music makes us feel emotion ect, so I flip to the page that discusses music. (It spelled if Musick in this book btw) I can not begin to tell you how much information it provided. On one of the pages, it described music as geometry. By this time the acid had kick in to its full effects. My friend and I were amazed by the way it explained it as geometry and were baffled by the diagrams it provided, but we didn't understand it. My friend told me the best way to understand was to go grab a bunch of printer paper and markers and spread out all over the ping pong table. After a while of writing things out, drawing and discussing, we had made a pretty big mess but were still a pretty confused. The rest of my friends came down stairs and were amazed at the mess and information we had printed. They asked us why and at the same time my partner in research exclaimed, ""because It's fucking interesting!"" Music is such a powerful thing, it could be another language if you think about. You guys understand right? This was just so fucking interesting. We finally figured that these diagrams explained how song structure should be arranged to create a good chord progression. They were lines that showed ratios of certain chords. It was so fascinating, plus it felt really good to figure it out. One of the best trips I've had. I also bonded even more with my ""lab partner"". I haven't been able to find any other information about these diagrams on the web. I wish I had kept the drawings we made so I could share. 

TL;DR Friend and I figured out how music can be explained through geometric patterns on a ping pong table and astonished our friends. If you ever want to solve a problem, drop some acid.

I've posted it to r/psilocybin as well, but that sub is very small/inactive at this point.

In response to a recent question regarding the heat-sensitivity of LSD and other psychedelic alkaloids, I was reminded of my favorite way to imbibe psychedelic mushrooms.  The heat involved in this method--100C and lower--appears to have no deleterious effect on the active ingredients.  As well, the constituents of P. cubensis &amp; related species which can cause nausea are fat-soluble, and are therefore largely bypassed from consumption with this method.  Between my own experiences and others’, I know of scores of times that this was used quite successfully.

At least 1 hour, preferably 2 or more, since your last meal (an empty stomach generally increases sensitivity to the alkaloids):

1) Bring 12oz/360ml (per dose) of water to boil in a pot. Turn off heat, add desired fungus and some mint leaves.  I don't recommend caffeine-bearing tea, since the come-one by this method is so intense that complicating it with other alkaloids is undesirable.

2) Allow the brew to cool to room temperature.  Once it is, strain and drink the full 12oz all at once.  

3) Re-fill pot with the same amount of water, bring to boil, shut off, allow to steep and cool for 20 minutes.

4) Drink the second batch all at once as well.   The first batch should be just kicking in now.  

The next half hour will be very powerful, far more so than you'd get from eating the same dose.  Just as this first wave levels out, the second glassful kicks in, bringing you up to a higher level.  Altogether, it will quite likely be a stronger, somewhat briefer experience than you're accustomed to from mushrooms.  Choose your dose accordingly, if you typically prefer 1/8 oz, go with 2g instead, if you typically prefer 2g, try a little more than 1.  One time I made a pot for 5 folks, using a quarter ounce.  Turns out no-one else wanted more than a small cup so I wound up drinking half the pot.  Oh, my.  Turns out they were a rather weak strain, so it didn’t last very long, but during the peak I did experience the strongest visuals and heaviest body load of my fungal career, so to speak.

I consider myself to be an intelligent person, and I believe I was aided in that respect by lacking emotions for a long time.  Throughout my life, I've never had any strong emotions.  I never completely lacked them I suppose, but most feelings were weak and others learned behaviors that I found other people considered normal and thus added to my own portrayal of myself.

When I dropped 3 tabs of high grade acid, I had a bad trip.  I experienced all of the negative emotions I could, stronger than I thought possible for me.  My visual field rippled as a whole along with individual things changing, spaghetti seemed to pulsate and slither around on it's own on my plate.  I'll keep the trip report short, since you most likely have heard many similar stories.  I felt my mind being torn apart.  I asked my boyfriend (i'm gay) at the time if it would be okay to let go, if I would return to normal.  I detected hesitancy when he answered ""Yes."", but as the trip progressed, I really didn't have a choice in the matter.  I tripped for a total of 12 hours or at least, I went to sleep towards the end of it.

Afterwards, when I woke up, my consciousness was still scrambled.  I had to reprogram myself from the inside out, how memories were stored, how sounds were processed.  I didn't have a continuous memory until a month later, and I progressed through what I call ""abstraction layers"" until I reached the top where I was before and kept going.  

The best way I can describe it is the difference between doing all the sub processes without having to actively think about it and doing all of them manually.  It's like doing something new like long division.  At first, you have to think about how each number interacts.  Once you get the hang of it, there's no need to write out all of the work, and the answer is as easy as reading the question.  Once I don't have to think of sub processes, then I consider myself to have gone up an abstraction layer.  Throughout all of that time, and it took me a little while to really realize it in that state, I had emotions.  My theory is that I had to reconstruct my mind because a new variable of my psyche was introduced.  Now, I can choose to feel or not to, at least to the extent I did before.

I'm interested to see if anyone else had a similar experience where LSD changed the way they think.  How would you describe it?  Does my story sound similar to others you may have read?

I thought LSD had changed my life for so much of the better.


I had  been hiding my voice changing the way it sounds for 5 years. I am a woman, and my voice used to be very deep so I would get called a man. I moved to Florida from Georgia and the accent didn't help so I conceived this voice for myself that sounded nothing like me. And it pretty much was this bitch whistle from hell that hid my accent but was also slightly nasally. The way I would speak I would hold my tongue on a certain place on my mouth and I held it there for 5 years.


Over the past few years the voice I was using became very habitual, and it stuck. And I forgot I even had a voice of my own. I took a lot lsd yesterday, and although I didn't see much I had a very big mental high. I have a terrible memory, and remembered everything that night. 


I also remembered, I had a voice. I have been struggling with identity crisis, so when lsd changed my voice back to how it used to be sure It sounded husky and all. But I could hit every high note, I sounded so natural, the voice sounded like me. The voice stuck with me for 24 hours. And I was so happy to have my voice back after these 5 years of hiding it and thinking the bitch whistle I was using was my real voice.


Fast forward to now and that voice went away. And I'm not sure why. My voice was beautiful, it felt like me, I could sing. I could hit every octave. 


I want my voice back, and I don't know how. I know that was how my voice used to be. This bitch whistle I used before isn't me, and it reverted back to it. Now I am holding my tongue in the right positions unlike I have been doing for 5 years, it is sitting normally. But my voice still went back to mid range. And a vocal range of a pygmy squirrel, when before on lsd it was of a sperm whale and I was genuinely happy because for the first time I felt like me.


Can someone help? I think I may have acid reflux these past few years if that helps solve anything but I'm not sure why that would change on LSD or cause it to revert itself.

I thought that my fingers were bleeding at some points as we had played so long, and this offbeatyness of it put our heads in a strange place afterwards, we couldnt really speak and we felt somewhat aimless afterwards and could just follow the bassist round, the drummer even forgot how to process english at some points, his first language is french but still has perfect english. ohh it was strange.

1335669543.0,35,self.LSD,sxp7z,"The Amusement park on LSD, my experience.",40,5,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/LSD/comments/sxp7z/the_amusement_park_on_lsd_my_experience/,"So, I was recently reminiscing about the time when me and two friends decided to go to Six Flags Great America (amusement park) on acid, and I'd thought I'd share the story.  


We drove two hours to get to the park, and each took two drops from a vial of liquid my buddy had.  I'm not sure what it was mic'd at, but it was definitely some quality L.  


We parked our car in the MASSIVE parking lot and began to prepare ourselves for entrance into the park.  We knew that we were going to have to stand in lines for awhile waiting for roller coasters, so we armed ourselves with iPods, backpacks full of gum/candy, a yo-yo, and a few other goodies.  


We enter the park about an hour after dosing, and get in line for the Batman roller coaster.  We all have our headphones on, starting to feel pretty good.  We are in line for about 45 minutes before we get to the front of the line, and Shpongle is sounding REALLY good on my iPod.  Visuals are starting to really pop.  We get to the front of the line, and adrenaline starts flowing.  Then, the employee running the coaster says something along the lines of: ""Oh, i'm sorry, you can't get on the coaster with your backpacks, you'll need to go rent a locker and get back in line.""  We all froze.  I think it took about 10 seconds before I said anything, but it felt like an eternity.  I ushered my friends out of line, and we decided to head back to the car to unload.  


After an hour inside the park, we rode nothing.  We each smoked a cigarette on the way back to the car, and laughed about how confused we were when the employee told us we couldn't get on the roller coaster.  We get to the car, drop off our backpacks, and decide to hang out at the car for a bit.  I opened all the doors in my car, and start blasting some music by String Cheese Incident.  We all started dancing in the parking lot.  After awhile, we realized that we had been at the car for another hour, so we mustered up the courage to go inside the park.  This time, we were going to try the water park section.  We had our swim suits on, and went inside.


We decide to go to the kiddie play area, because it looks the most fun, very colorful, water jets shooting out of the ground, etc.  After about 5 minutes of laughing and splashing around, I realize that the mixture of chlorine and body sweat really isn't too pleasing, at all.  We all agree to go back to the car.  


Back at the car again, we smoke a little weed, have a few cigarettes, and my buddy surprises us with a Tupperware full of watermelon chunks.  This REALLY hit the spot, as fruit always does.  We ate fruit, drank some gatorade, danced to more jam bands outside of my car, and decided that we NEEDED to get on a roller coaster.  We each ate a dip of some MDMA powder I had in my car, then we changed into dry clothes, and headed back inside, determined to get on a roller coaster.


We get inside and giggled as we walked past giant costumed employees dressed like Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck.  We headed straight for the 'Raging Bull' roller coaster, the biggest and baddest of the coasters at the park at the time.  The sign out front says ""Average wait time: 2 hours"".  We exchanged looks and reluctantly got into line.  Standing in line with screaming children behind us and the hairy back of a sweaty fat man in front of us was NOT ideal conditions while tripping balls, but we managed to get through it.  I entertained myself by staring intently at bubblegum stains on the concrete, which were very abundant.  I pulled leaves off of the bushes that bordered the lines, and marveled at mother nature.  


About 90 minutes after getting in line, everything is going fine, and we can see the front of the line.  All of a sudden, a gust of wind sends the aroma of fresh vomit in our direction.  We all exchange very concerned glances.  I felt like I was going to throw up, and so did they.  Luckily, my buddy had a tin of Vick's Vapo-Rub in his pocket, and we all scrambled to rub some of that under our noses.  This definitely saved the day.  


At long last, we made it to the front of the line, and all loaded up into the very front of the coaster.  Buckled in, the ride begins, and we start climbing up the steep incline to the top of the Raging Bull.  The ride went CLICK CLICK CLICK as we slowly climbed higher and higher.  The view was magnificent, we could see for miles, the people on the ground looked like ants, looking down on the trees from above was amazing.  It felt like we had been ascending for about an hour before we reached the top.  Then, it was go-time.  It was INSANE!  We dropped hundreds of feet at what felt like a near vertical drop.  There were trees whizzing past our heads.  I pulled my sweaty, clammy hands off the handrail and throw them above my head.  We went through loop-DE-loops, corkscrews, and lots of drops.  The ride probably lasted only about 3 minutes, but it felt like forever.  I don't think any of us blinked the entire ride.  We also giggled like schoolgirls the entire time.  A slight feeling of disappointment rushed over me when we started to slow down and pull into the station.  The ride was over, but we were still giggling like schoolgirls.  We finally got off the coaster and walked out to the main street, and we each just said ""Wow.""  The experience was unbelievable, and aside from the horrifying experience waiting in line, it was the most incredible thing I have experienced on LSD.  An almost orgasmic experience.


We decided, again, that we should make a stop at the car for a smoke break.  We spent ANOTHER hour at the car, doing our usual routine of smoking, dancing, and eating fruit.  It's starting to get dark, and we knew we had to get inside for maybe a few more rides.  


The lines were still excruciatingly long, so we only rode one more roller coaster, the Superman coaster.  This, too, was a phenomenal experience.  At one point during a loop, my sunglasses flew off my face and time stopped.  I grabbed for them and amazingly caught them in mid-air.  I held onto them for dear life until the end of the ride.  


After this, we walked around for quite a bit.  By now, the sun had set, and vendors began selling brightly colored glow sticks/batons/necklaces, flashing rave-style LED toys, and this made me very happy.  Strobe lights going off everywhere, I couldn't stop smiling.  Then, I see it.  The ""Tea Cup"" ride.  There was NO line to wait in.  We rushed into a teacup, and the ride started.  We spun ourselves INCREDIBLY fast, got sooooo dizzy, and laughed nonstop.  I think we rode the teacups at least 10 times before the night was through.  


Dizzy and physically exhausted, we walked back to the car.  We were coming down from the trip, but I didn't want to drive just yet, so we spent another hour laughing, dancing, and smoking at my car before we realized that we were one of the few cars left in the parking lot.  


All-in-all, we probably spent about 3 hours actually INSIDE the park, and 5-6 hours hanging out at my car.  However, the experience was definitely a very, very memorable one!


That's all I can remember, as it was a few years ago.  Anyone else have any experience with roller coasters and LSD?",,False,,t5_2qhvj,False,,,True,t3_sxp7z,http://www.reddit.com/r/LSD/comments/sxp7z/the_amusement_park_on_lsd_my_experience/,

I would divide the process into 3 main stages. In the first, light enters your eyes and your brain does basic processing on it. It sorts the images into separate objects, looks for motion, and does some other little tricks like filling in your blind spot. The second is a subconscious filter of the visual information. This filter is an evolutionary adaptation, and is mostly built up by your experiences in life. It is not practical, for a hunter gatherer or for a modern person, to wander around always paying attention to everything he sees. So instead he is trained to only notice the ""important things"", namely things that could potentially cause him harm or provide him with some sort of tangible benefit. Almost all the information that originally enters the brain is blocked by this filter. The third stage is the actual conscious awareness of the information. LSD effects all three of these stages. A common misconception though, especially by those who've never tripped, is that it primarily effects the first. Really LSD's most profound effects are on the second stage, it pretty much rips away this filter. It gets rid of all your preconceived notions about what things are like and what is worthy of attention. And this effect doesn't just apply to the visual filter. We have auditory filters, filters on our thought processes, filters on our sense of self, and filters on our conception of humanity. On acid these are all gone. This is an extraordinarily helpful thing, because it allows a person to examine all of these things in a less biased way. You may notice that the cracks in the ground are really cool looking. Or you may realize that thing that you've been so worried and stressed about doesn't really matter at all. Maybe you find that you have internalized a particular negative self view that really is only true not because you are that way by your nature, but just because you continue to act that way. Or you could realize that every single human on the planet has these same sorts of complicated experiences and perceptions, and there is no absolute truth to any of it. As we go through life we constantly integrate information into our existing concepts. We establish deeply patterns of thought and behavior, this is what allows us to act quickly instead of puzzling over the same rudimentary issues time and time again. But often these established patterns of perception are detrimental to our happiness and inconsistent with the world as it really is. So occasionally it is helpful to tear these biases down, and reflect on the world without the filters we've created.

I was extremely sceptical if i need to try or not . I really wanted to given that i have read so many experiences of different people and i always wanted to experience something like that. I got myself a blot and i went away to a remote place with 2 of my closest friends .

I was just surrounded by nature and nothing else. No electricity , no network . Just woods and plantations. I took the blot by around 11am and nothing kicked in till an hour. Then i started feeling light and i was feeling very elated . I could see some nice patterns in sky but i was not hallucinating. I just felt i was clear and happy. I had this sudden urge to draw so i started drawing somethings that were around me. It felt extremely nice. My trip stopped by around 3 and i was not really happy cause it was not as different as it was supposed to be.

Then i had lunch and somewhere i had read that Pot makes LSD trip stronger and people shouldnt do it when they are on LSD. So i thought let me smoke up a lil then i should be able make the LSD kick in and hence i had a few drags . 10-15 mins in to the trip,the world started glowing and i realised now what LSD actually was.

I became a little paranoid initially as i could see multiple time frames and it spooked me . Then it stopped . I went inside the cabin and was still having hillarious conversations with my friend. Then suddenly his face became a card and was divided into 4 parts. One part changing color and the other full of graphs. His ears extending . It was like a fast forward photoshop world . This made me even more anxious and i dont wanna lie i did really feel scared. I got out of the cabin and went out for a walk . And wow did the world suddenly change. 

The woods around me was connected to me and they were trying to convey something. I could see patterns everywhere. I saw some beautiful things and there were certain things that were not so nice to me but i had to fight them and the fighting to make things positive around me made the trip even more amazing.

I spoke to my friend about black holes , ufo , aliens , egyptian  hieroglyphics , trees , nature , birds  and i could see all of them too. It was just incredible. I had complete control and i felt like i was a part of an actual 4d movie . 

I could feel the grass i was sitting on send energy to my body. Sometimes i could not understand the dimension and the things around me felt like they were shifting their positions. It could actually feel widescreen and no matter how close i went to certain things i could see more than i normally could. I could understand the different shades of green and how trees have their unique way of adding ornaments to themselves.

I had close to 3 hours intense trip and when it started going down , i could now understand why people say you are never the same .
I cant thank my friend enough , cause he really helped me to stay positive.

I think people have a wrong notion of LSD (so did i before i did it). It should not be used to party(recreational) is what i feel . LSD is just beautiful and teaches you so much.

Thank you all for sharing your thoughts , it really helped me when i was tripping.

I hope this post isn't inappropriate for this subreddit...

I wanted to know if any of you know much or have experienced sex on LSD and what your thoughts are on it? I've done LSD about 6 times now but never really thought about sex while on it. I suppose because there's so much going on that it's the furthest thing from your mind...but I stumbled upon a few forums where people say sex on LSD is mind-blowing and beautiful. Definitely not something to try for your first few trips...having experienced LSD plenty, I think it's a sensation I'm interested in experiencing with my boyfriend on my next trip. Especially for him actually because I read that while some women might find it weird feeling, men have the best sex on earth while tripping...

My bf and I are together for 6 years and we're very much still in love...we heard that it's best to have sex with someone you already love on LSD because it can heighten feelings of love and make you feel strongly connected and emotionally bonded so being with a stranger may give you false feelings of love...also being with a stranger could be scary...lol...so avoid one night stands on LSD! (Good thing that isn't my kind of thing! :) )

So what are your thoughts about sex on LSD. Is it doable during the peak? Or even advisable to attempt sex during the peak? Is it better on the come down? At what point during the trip is it best? ANY thoughts or insight you want to share would be appreciated. Also what dosage do you think we should be on?

Thanks! (Hope this post isn't offensive to anyone...apologies in advance.)",,False,,t5_2qhvj,1373284405.0,,,True,t3_1huvxj,http://www.reddit.com/r/LSD/comments/1huvxj/sex_on_lsd/,

'And everyday, the paperboy brings more' Quickly, eat the paper. Eat the chemicals. Suck on the paper through and through, swallow. Knowing it usually takes a long time for the trip to start, but unsure of how fast it'll come up since you're already rolling.

'Look for the girl with kaleidoscopic eyes, and...shes...gone' Three minutes later, gone. Listening to music. No. Feeling. Feel the waves. Open your eyes, see the flow, see the patterns, the colors. Feel them. No longer feeling the roll, but feeling the trip. Everything you see you feel. See the visuals, and feel them.

Quick look outside. Suddenly there it is. Every answer to every question. Every star flickering different colors. Your mind running millions of miles a second. Feeling the knowledge of what this trip intended to teach you. Feel it. Think it. Don't lose the new found knowledge.

The earth. People. Body. Brain. Animals. Nature. Think it. Write it. 

This life, this life on earth it's not the first. It's not the last. This body, each moving muscle, every nerve, I don't know anatomy. But suddenly I appreciate it. How does this machine work? This machine only getting 5-8 hours of down time per day. Our brain. How does this contraption work? We see, smell, hear, touch, and taste things? These words? What do these even mean? How does this even.. We've made this.. language, another word in itself.. and we can use it to communicate with others? Wild.

Suddenly my appreciation for everything has grown, how many moving parts there are to move a car, to function a computer, hell, to use a phone.. and we're simply pressing buttons. Turning wheels. Sliding our fingers on a screen. Technology, man made objects. How did we evolve into such smart organisms? How did our race grow so intelligent? 

Look at the grass, the snow. Think of the seasons, how cold it is here. About location, how hot it is somewhere else. About the billions of people on this planet. Think about life. How many stresses there are, how many problems. Every single one of us has those. Think about the man you passed on the street, the girls in the store. Every one leading lives of their own, with their own problems, stresses, friends. Never judge again. Sure, she might have been mean. But she has tons of problems. He might have been a dick once, but his life has his own problems. I am not to judge. 

Think about how blessed you are. This life. On this beautiful planet. About how lucky we are to live this life. How blessed we are to be alive. Alive. I could die before I finish typing this. Before I even finish this thought. And here I am. Here you are. If you are lucky enough to be reading this post. If you are alive. Then you have every reason in the world to be happy. The happiest person alive. Because if you can't be happy to be alive, you can't be happy at all. And you're only as happy as you make yourself, right?

This life is not what people think. Money. Everyone wants money. But this life is not a pissing contest to see who can get the biggest cash pile. Greed. There is so much greed in this world. This planet is so beautiful and it's inhabitants suck. Why is everything so damn political? So centered around money? No one on the telly talks about how beautiful it is today. No one shares an amazing story that gives faith in humanity. Instead it's about killings, fighting countries, government conspiracies. All centered around money. 

It is not what this life is for. Everyone on this planet will die someday. And guess what. You're not taking anything with you. What you get out of this life, what you take with you, is the love, joy, and happiness you had and shared during your life. This political garbage, this ""Well, I'm moving because the president sucks!"", this is all garbage. GARBAGE. Look around. Do you see this world? Do you see the beauty? Can't you feel how blessed you are to be alive? 

You. Every damn one of you. Myself included. We are so lucky. We didn't ask for this life, and we were blessed with it. The earth is truly beautiful. The brain is an amazing thing. 

Wake up, open your eyes. This life is amazing. Stop wasting it. Please, please stop wasting it. It is not what you think it is. This is beautiful. This life is truly amazing. Do not waste it worrying how big your bank is. Or about political garbage. This life is meant to be spent with your loved ones, knowing, and fully enjoying this beautiful, BEAUTIFUL planet. 

TL;DR, I've eaten a few chemicals... annnnddd... I share how I feel on a few topics. The Earth and this life are amazing. I have learned.. So.. so much tonight.

Also.. Feel free to ama about tonight or chems.. I'll answer the best I can. Currently sitting on the roof with my lappy.

We are on this journey in life to learn about our consciousness. Our consciousness is limited because we are stuck in a reality where we have chosen to install limits in order to analyze ourselves accordingly. We chose to install the limitations of not knowing of a previous existence and not being sure of an afterlife in order to see how this affects us and changes us. We therefore give our consciousness now no reassurance that we have forever to improve ourselves. We took this journey in order to analyze our consciousness and dive deeper into what makes us ourselves at our core.  When this life is over, we will be brought back to wherever it is we were and be judged by ourselves in our purest form where we know the true meaning of right and wrong. There is no true example of a perfect consciousness and this is why we do not have a perfect world and wherever we are going after this life still has yet to reach perfection. Many people have a false sense that the greatest existence that could be is pure happiness, but this too me seems to be too simple. The true greatest existence we could have is being ourselves under every possible emotional circumstance. This is the most important part of our existence as humans because I believe that wherever we go in the afterlife, we may be able to hide who we truly are at some points and our human form brings our purest selves in our true emotional states.  Our consciousness is supposed to affect reality and we took this trip to human existence in order to figure out ways we can affect it for a more positive overall outcome. We will look at our human existence similar to the way we look at dreams and memories, we will not be able to access our human form again or relive any of it, but it will be an experience in our existence that will affect us in some way, as any experience affects us now as humans. For some of us, we will be fascinated by it and it will help a lot, for others they will need some other form of existence in order to find what they were looking for. The beauty in all of it is that we are not supposed to know what happens in the end.

I did acid one hit last night and it was so intense. I wrote a nice trip report, that I want to share. I would love it if you guys read and comment to discuss. If you feel that it is too long, please at least read the paragraph titled ""THE PEAK""

**Trip Report:**

So I had some LSD tabs waiting for a good time, a time when my friends and I can get together without schedule conflicts. Early in the day, my female friend called and asked if I wanted to trip tonight with her and her boyfriend after we all visited a haunted house and I agreed.

After we get back from the haunted house, we head out to the lake. We setup our tents and the rest of our campsite. We got into the tent, and we dropped acid. The male friend dropped two, my female friend and I dropped one. The drop was approximately at 11:30PM. A little after twelve, I started feeling the effects. Everything was more hilarious and I'd get random urges to do random things. I remember having the urge to tuck my chin and lips into my shirt for no reason. When my friends looked at me, we all started laughing pretty hard. These types of things continued for another hour or two. 

After the hour of the beginning, I started to lose perspective of time. Minutes were sometimes going by either more quickly or slowly than estimated. I started feeling a little euphoria, but a little unease because I felt such a strange intense high that I've never felt before. That phase lasted approximately 1-2hrs.

THE PEAK: 

Later on, the trip is starting to really set in. I feel really good and felt a true one-ness with everything. It seemed as all my everyday thoughts and feelings went out the window and I was just one with the Earth. And I was ok with it. My female friend and I decided to go outside the tent and play, also she needed to go urinate. My male friend was working all that day before the trip so he was extremely tired and just wanted to lay down. While she was urinating I was somewhere  dancing around along side the trees, even hugged a few. I just felt really close and one with nature. I started ranting about why are we constantly pursuing entertainment through technology, when we got this magnificent world amongst us. I ran towards the lake water and beheld it and started to tear up to a significant degree in awe. The wind was blowing constantly that night. Because of this, my female friend was playing with toilet paper and was letting it blow in the wind. We both agreed it looked amazing. The stream of toilet paper just looked awesome. She gave me a long piece and I danced around with it, letting the wind stream and wave it around. Never had I felt so alive since I was a child. It was very cold out and windy. But we both agreed we were ok with it. We talk about how our bodies are supposed to withstand this weather, we just have spoiled ourselves. The cold was not bothering either of us. After playing around outside, we decided to go back in the tent and eat some fruit. We continued laughing, sharing insight, and visually stimulating (with glow sticks, etc) for a few more hours. 

Around 5AM or so, everyone decided to lay down. I was very restless as my thoughts were racing. I also was very uneasy because I couldn't communicate with anyone (without disrupting their rest, of course). I began to kind of go into a state of overwhelm and even a bit of fear. I was laying down looking through the mesh at the top of the tent. My thoughts raced from good, to bad, to silly, to insightful, to funny, and so on, but at an extremely rapid rate. It was scary for what seemed like about an hour, and then I felt at ease. I just figured out that it is like a dream, if it's bad, you can make it good. I then closed my eyes and saw a bunch of beautiful and psychedelic visuals. Something that my imagination could never do normally. It looked absolutely amazing. It was visuals that made me wish I was a pro CGI guy, who could recreate these visuals. 

I started coming down slowly, visuals getting less and less intense. The sun rose. I was no longer tripping but still very high. Everyone started waking up, we packed up, and headed to my friends' home. Everything is going by so slowly. 5 minutes seem like 20. My female friend drops my male friend off at work, we go home and watched the first two episodes of  Carl Sagan's The Cosmos. The episodes were absolutely amazing and insightful. We then head off to bed. It took me 2-3 hours to go to sleep. Once I finally do, I sleep for an hour and wake up 100% sober. Mind was still in awe for a little while, but in don't think I was under the influence anymore.

All and all, it was such an amazing and bonding experience, I do not regret it. I am absolutely glad I did it that night, it seemed perfect. I feel as though I've been reborn. I feel as if I'm changed for the better, but not sure what have changed about me. Not yet, at least, as I am submitting the trip report the day after I dropped.

I can't really put into words how truly amazed my friends and I were. Almost all of us started tearing up at one point or another just at the sheer beauty of what we were seeing and hearing.

Luckily we'd timed our dosages just perfectly to be at our peak when they started playing. When they started up their light show the only way I could describe it properly was by staring completely wide-eyed with my jaw practically on the floor trying to mouth ""HOLY SHIT"" but not really succeeding. They were kind enough to supply a psychedelic visualisation of their music behind themselves when they were playing and put on an amazing light show to boot.
 
I felt what was like a perfect resonation of notes and rhythm within my body as they played. One song melted into the next one in my mind and their instrumentals were fascinating to watch and completely unexpected which was lovely. I know we mixed in MDMA so it wasn't 100% due to the LSD but my goodness did it add a positive spin on the whole night! At the moment I can't fathom a combination of friends, drugs or concerts that'd top that experience. Here's a show they did in Brisbane last year which was somewhat similar if you're interested: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgkhanuzMTo

The experience of watching Tame Impala in a whole new way got me even more excited to see what else is good. I know people say that LSD really heightens your appreciation of music but our feeble minds weren't ready for that much appreciation!

""what lsd feels like.  It feels like eveetrtthing you're used to seeing is different so its like your always having to readjust yourself to make sense of the new rules.??? Music has a effect on the way everrything looks vice versa.

part of me forgets i actually took anything. As if this is what life feels like always but it cant be true... So many colors and bumps and the keyboard is hard to focus on and im lozing track of my fingures and the music is all over the walls.

yup its working.

part of you forgets that youre experienceing a trip and it tries to covnvince itself its real. But it's not real. The room is spinnning and colors are mixing everywhere. I wish I could paint now.

The Funeral Band of horses [song]

water is flowing everywhere now damnit lol... Now that im experiencing it again for myself in its most poowerful nature i dont think its possible for me to ever be able to explain to you what im feeling right now but I WISH YOU COULD FEEL IT RIGHT NOW!

its sad because its always all in your head. This unforuntately isnt what life is. No freedom to express and mold. and become one. beautiful

Trying to see if maybe each time i've done acid the trip has just been like this but i just didnt remember it to be this way. Maybe it was just as intense. 

It changes how everything feels and sounds to you. Also how it looks. Colors constantly change. Looks like I might be repeating myself. Some Daft Punk is playing now.

Whats normal isnt normal to a user under the influence of very good lsd.

Your mind starts to trick you. Makes you think that this all makes sensee. Even if I wasnt on acid it would make sense to me because this is how life IS. But it isn't.

It's funny because my body has to keep adjusting to the new changes in SOUND FEEL SEE THINKING

It makes you stand up to think. You stand and think about what you're going to do but stop yourself from going through it cause in real life it wouldnt look natural.

The sounds sound different its hard to understand them. It's as if life is music. All the colors are mixing together. Im not sure if it's raining outside or if it's just me. 

I've been trying to get out of my room to draw or paint for the past 20 minutes but it feels like an eternity. 

I'm not sad it's taking so long b

This isnt for everyone. It's going to make you look at life differently for sure afterwards.. On different level that can't even be explained. Fuck this normal words they dont do me justice!!!

It tries to make everything seem normal when it's not normal. So hard to describe. 

Colors are so bold and changing shapes over and over. Kind of sounds like water is being turn upside down as if you're emptying a bottle.

Still trying to figure if this is natural or not. Probably not natural. But my brain wants to convince it is. It's  trying its hardest to make sense of everything but sense can never be found in this dimension. 

The music is what makes this trip so enjoyable. Animal Collective and MGMT make sense. Everything could make sense maybe then? Perhaps if I went outsdie everything would remain this way.

I doubt that.

Definitely makes you question what's real and what isn't real. Between liquid and physical. As if i never took the lsd. As if this is what life is always like. Colors flying mixing and turning with the music
If only life was this beautiful. Looks like count dracula from sesame street?

Driving is a no go. The lines start to mix together and make patterns. You're head tricks you into thinking this is how life is but it isn't by far. It's trying to rationalize itself.

Feeels like the world is contantly moving. I'm forgetting thing's I had promised from before and keep mixing them with what I think is important at the momemnt? 

Colors change, tastes change, light changes, feelings change, everything changes to insane ways you can't even imagine. There is no way to comprehend this feeling. I'm typing it because I want to share my expeirence.

Nobody else is seeing life this way :( This is what j meant by you can't share things sometimes

Grizzly bear on a neck on a spit. [song]

Ice cream melts from your mouth then everything melts from itself?

Its gets hotter then colder out of nowhere. I forgot if I took the drug. You're lucky I have this here to type on.

you would love this mix of taste, lights, sounds, freedom. I question if anyone else can see what I see. Probably not. The music is beautiful and it makes my game more enmjoyable. 

My teemamtes is staring at me as if i did something wrong. Sounds like my friends judge me. The way they talk to me. Feel like my phone is vibrating and making noises when it shouldnmt.

There are echoe's everywhere. Colors get brighter and darker and twist and turn. Everything just melts away. Belinds beautifuly. 

Playing BF3 feels like im also playing DayZ at the same time so I confuse keybinds for each other.

Promised someone that in BF3 if he was the pilot i'd be the co-pilot and wouldn't fire any shots at all just as long as I can watch him fly and just enjoy the ride.

I forgot how long ago my dad left us for work... 2 days ago?

Anxiety is nothing but a bad habit, stemming from suppressed memories...some advice: try to eat lightly and gently from at least a day before and drop the LSD a few hours after a light meal...fruit is the best food for LSD. Please guys, only do this with people you are 100% comfortable with and who love you dearly! Its important to always remind yourself that you are on drugs when that anxiety comes along, put up sticky notes if you have to. Another thing that helped settled my anxiety was sipping on pure orange juice VERY SLOWLY lol. It slows down the racing thoughts and visuals. You’ll get through the trip fine and with no regrets if you get the set/setting right. Go into it with the intention to resolve any issue, including anxiety, and so shall it be! Meditation, yoga and reading books like “The Alchemist” by Paulo Coelho in the preceding weeks helps you go into the trip feeling more positive and relaxed, which is important especially if you suffer with chronic anxiety.  Love you guys colorfully!

**My trip report:**

About 2 weeks back, my sister (a fairly experienced tripper) gave me 4 tabs (they were about 50ug each so together I had about 200ug). I ate them, excitedly waiting for the big change to occur. I was told there would be slight anxiety at first, but I don’t recall experiencing any and this was good considering I had suffered with severe anxiety on an everyday basis.

So everyone starting doing their own thing and being amazed with the awesome visuals but I was uneasy, everything was moving too fast, both in my mind and all around me, I felt as if I couldn’t even stand or walk but I’m pretty sure it was all in my head and that I was walking about just fine. I began to feel overwhelmed by all the movement and my mind was flooding with thoughts. I started to puke...more than once. I remember feeling a lot of emotional pain whilst puking. It was as if each time I had puked, all the negative things that I had said and done to myself and others in my life had emptied itself from me leaving space for something that I couldn’t figure out what at the time. After each time I had puked, I felt more and more in control. I felt alive. Slowly, with the help of my sister, I settled into the moment. I started noticing gentle movements in everything, the tile patterns were moving, colours melted into each other…thoughts raced, and then I started to feel extreme happiness and love.

   

The peak was all colourful and pretty but it was during the come-down that I experienced those life-changing moments. I began to understand how the world works, where we come from and what we are. I remember taking a shower and when I had looked into the mirror, I felt new, I actually looked new. My skin was glowing and I could finally look at myself in the mirror without any complexes or thoughts about having imperfections. I felt reborn. My soul was delighted that it was free to roam about in this body. I had remembered things that I had been doing in life that was not serving me. I found resolutions to so many issues and I’m more capable of controlling my anxiety now.

Lsd helped me to see the love in everyone and in myself. The feeling I got is that we are one, we come from the same place, we chose to be here in these bodies experiencing everything we are experiencing. We live in an illusion and our world is subjective! People understand these theories, about love and oneness and spreading happiness by being happy, but it’s hard to apply those things and know the true power of it until you experience it. LSD helped me experience it.

Have any of you guys had similar experiences?,30,3,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/LSD/comments/1bm94n/lsd_made_me_extremely_close_with_my_best_friend/,"I've tripped 4 times in my life. The first 3 times were with my absolute best friend. It was only us two all 3 times. We rode bikes, walked in the forest, and just sat and talked for hours. Every trip made us so much closer as friends. We would have very deep conversations which made me (and him) extremely happy. I could never stop smiling when I was with him and tripping.
Well, he joined the military so I don't really see him as much anymore. And I definitely am not tripping with him anymore. I tripped in december with two other pretty close friends. I felt good and all, but something was different. I couldn't have the same deep conversations with them as my best friend. I just thought about him a lot. I missed him while I was tripping more than I ever have at any other time. After about 3 or 4 hours of tripping I decided to go home since I wasn't tripping as hard as I have and I wanted to talk to my best friend. 
Luckily, he was online on Facebook chat when I got home(it was about 2 am). Just chatting with him online made my trip hit me harder than it did at any other time. We had great conversations over facebook chat. It was great. He was making me laugh, cry, and really question some things in life. He even said just talking to me while I was tripping made him feel like he was tripping a little bit too.
So finally to my main point/question. Do you guys feel way more comfortable tripping with the person that you started doing it with? Do you feel more connected with someone after tripping with them? Or maybe I just am connected with him because we are best friends and it has nothing to do with the LSD. 
I'm just curious. Let me know your feedback :)

1359663214.0,27,self.LSD,17ncni,My experience with Buddhism and LSD (X-post from r/buddhism),35,8,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/LSD/comments/17ncni/my_experience_with_buddhism_and_lsd_xpost_from/,"Let me proceed this posting by iterating that I understand drug use is not acceptable by Buddhist virtue. I feel that for many of you your first thought will be to remind me of this fact, but rest assured knowing I realize that the use of hallucinogens isn't a ""legitimate"" experience of enlightenment. I put quotations as I feel the definition of legitimate is subjective, but I digress. I just felt my experience would be worth sharing here as I have spent time studying Buddhist philosophy and noticed much of it relates to my experience. Feel free to skip to the fourth paragraph to reach the part relating to my temporary enlightenment.

Funnily enough, I became interested in the properties of lysergic acid diethylamide when reading about Buddhism. I learned that some users experience an enlightening experience while under the influence of the compound which interested me greatly. I pondered the idea of taking the drug for several weeks until I came to the conclusion that it would not be harmful to my health and, at the very least, would be a fun experience. I was not searching for fun though. Rather, I was searching to seek some sort of deep underlying understanding that I had been reading about for months in my personal studies of Buddhism. I knew what enlightenment was, but as I'm sure many of you can understand, I never actually knew what it was. I could recite a textbook definition, but I could never fully understand it in the same way one can accept that the earth is millions of miles away from the sun but not fully understand the scale of it.

Rewind to December 1st. My significant other and I had each acquired enough LSD for the two of us. We were reluctant as we placed the paper on our tongues, and after an hour, we were hesitant that anything would happen. We were completely wrong. I will not bother to explain the first three or four hours of the trip as it was merely hallucinatory and does not relate to Buddhism at all.

After four or five hours, the hallucinogenic effect began to wore off but was still present. Static objects did not seem to move at first glance as they did before, but if I focused on something long enough, I could see it shifting and undulating like water. I won't bother to explain my hallucinations in any further detail as they were fascinating but are not relevant to this. She and I left her house and went to a nearby river because the thought of the house, the walls, the construction, all the technology around us, just began to feel so unnatural and uneasy. It almost felt disgusting to be in a house because all it seemed to do was shelter me from the world around.

Ten minutes later, we arrived at the nearby creek. At this point, the feelings of oneness and complete understanding began. It was raining moderately, but I simply did not care as I normally would. I felt no difference between the molecules of the falling water and those of my skin. I thought to myself, ""Why do we about protecting ourselves from rain? Why do we shelter ourselves so much from nature?"" I had never felt so connected to the natural world in my entire life. I felt no different than the bark on the trees, the slick mud on the ground, or the running river below. I noticed a homeless man's shelter a ways down the river, and did not feel pity for him. In a way, I almost felt jealous that he was not bound to society and its norms. He was free to be one with the universe and had no need to worry about getting a job or paying for college. We also came to the conclusion that the iPhone was the pinnacle of mankind's existence, which we laughed at.

Everything I had ever thought before began to collapse, but it did not distress me. It was a cathartic understanding that I will never forget.

When we returned from the river, my girlfriend's mother showed us an interesting cup she bought and I felt repulsed by it, almost depressed. I felt sad that she spent money for a few seconds of entertainment or happiness and was proud enough of it to show us. The thought of money was absolutely absurd, and at this point I questioned the plans I had set up for my life. I realized my goal was to make money so that I could live a happy life, but after feeling repulsed by the thought of money, you could imagine how I felt about selling my soul to become a wealthy code monkey. I did not want to be stuck in the classic gilded cage scenario. I should include that this experience lead me to change my major from computer science and follow a less lucrative path that I actually love -- geology. This decision has improved my life more than I can explain, and I feel like I am actually going to do something worthwhile with my short consciousness on earth.

Now that we had returned home, I felt the need to escape from indoors again, so we went to her hot tub. In retrospect, I am not sure why I was not disgusted by the hot tub as I was with everything else manmade. As we rested within the warm water, we began to talk incessantly. When I say incessantly, I mean literally constant talking. We could not hold back speaking because every word that came from our mouths was a new revelation for us. It was very overwhelming to have acquired this newfound understanding with the world around us.

At this time, I experienced temporary ego-death. I did not feel like anything, and it was beautiful. I was one with the universe, and I felt no emotion other than relief and release. I had no motivation or aspirations, I was not an intellectual or programmer anymore, I did not have a place in the universe or society, I simply was. I was nothing at all and everything in the universe. This was by far the most important part of my trip. I finally felt and understood everything I had been reading about.

In this phase of ego-death, my girlfriend and I made the most spiritual progress. Any question we had regarding our existence we could answer. Funnily enough, the answers usually boiled down to ""It's society's fault that something is this way,"" or, ""It is what it is and nothing else, that's all.""

The trip in total lasted about twelve or thirteen hours, and it was without question the most important day of my life. I realize that some may frown upon my experience as it isn't ""actual enlightenment"" in their eyes, but I respectfully disagree. While I will not argue that it was not achieved through typical means, I did achieve nirvana in the end regardless of the means. If you think it is not true enlightenment as it was reached through alternate means, feel free to think so.

As any LSD user will tell you, I do not see the universe the same way as I did while under the influence which is very unfortunate. At the time you are hallucinating, you feel like you will never lose that clarity and understanding of the universe. It was almost terrifying to think of how I would approach the world with my newfound knowledge. Unfortunately, I woke up completely sober and my thoughts felt muddy compared to how they did the night before. The impulses of ""check your phone"" and ""you need to do your homework"" returned, and I was back to my original state of deluded thinking. But for a wonderful 13 hour period, I had a window into the truth behind everything.

A complete shutdown of the left hemisphere of my brain is what I experienced. The childlike wonder with the universe rushed back in, and all feelings of stereotypes, classifications, time, anything manmade, was thrown out the window. I was nothing at all yet I was everything. Nature was profoundly beautiful in ways that are inexpressible with words. I simply wanted to love everyone and everything, even those who at the time I had thought I hated (a word which I refrain from using now).

I hope you enjoyed reading about my experience, and I would be more than happy to answer any question you have regarding it.

I worked out in the morning. I didn't drink anything. After a few hours and a few bowls, I took A LOT of LSD. I threw up EVERYTHING (and shit tons of fluid) on the come-up (because I took A LOT) and for 7-8 hours I drank nothing because I didn't even think to.

I was sitting in a chair in my buddy's living room when I suddenly felt BAD. I was tripping balls, so I couldn't put my finger on it, but I felt like my heart was beating slow, I was about to pass out, and I wasn't getting enough air. I leave the room and try to get some fresh air. I've tripping a lot, so I didn't start panicking.

But I realized that what I was feeling definitely wasn't the acid or just tiredness and that there was something seriously wrong with me when I suddenly began sweating profusely and almost passed out.

I drank a few sips of water and tried to lay down. But then there was a sharp pain in my chest and stomach, and I felt like I was wasting away, slowly but surely. I felt like I was slowly dying, and I thought that after taking all that acid, something happened to my heart and I needed medical attention.

All I needed was to drink about a half gallon of water and I felt almost completely better (I was just tired and weak). Learn from me. Make sure to stay hydrated. ESPECIALLY IF YOU THROW UP.

fast forward six months later and i'm geared up to trip again, this time alone. i got a bunch of stuff ready in preparation including a download of shpongle's *tales of the inexpressible*. things start to kick off and i sit down, turn the lights off and put the album on. for the second time i didn't know what to expect from shpongle.

what ensued was a chaotic cacophony of unexpected music. i was floored. i'd heard great things about shpongle - even seen them live, more or less - but this was different than anything i expected. it sounded like they were switching from their style of psychedelic music to modern rock to house to salsa, without giving any thought to meter or timing. it felt like there were smash cuts from genre to genre. ""this is genius!"" i thought. ""so much thought must have gone into this. it's perfectly designed to manipulate the way i'm feeling in this crazy, amazing way. i can't believe i've never listened to this before."" i figured i would understand it better once i was sober.

well, turns out that i pirated the music and someone was fucking with me, because i was actually listening to what i thought i was listening to - smash cuts of songs that were like 60% shpongle and 40% random other artists. 

this is the first track i listened to: https://dl.dropbox.com/u/27269911/01%20Dorset%20Perception.mp3

download the full ""album"" here: https://dl.dropbox.com/u/27269911/notshpongle.zip

the way the cuts shifted so abruptly from genre to genre did crazy things to my emotions while listening. it was even crazier knowing after that someone had fucked with me and i had possibly gotten more out of it than i would have if it was the actual album (which is excellent by the way).

i was reminiscing about those trips this morning and just wanted to share this funny story.

The first trip was really intense and while enjoyable, was not the best it could have been since I had no idea how to control it. 

The second time was a life changing experience. I tripped alone in my room and starred at psychedelic pictures while listening to music. My mind projected what I was hearing onto the images and they correlated to the music beautifully. One song in particular left an impact on me to this day, [John Bulter - Ocean](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdYJf_ybyVo), and made me appreciate how complicated and beautiful life is in a way I had never thought of before. 

Since that moment I haven't been able to see life the way I used to. Everything people do, make, say, think, etc. makes me appreciate it so much more. It really changed my entire outlook on life and all the aspects of it. Also smoking weed has become a far more entertaining and enjoyable experience since my first trip. 

Have any of you had similar experiences with LSD? I don't think I'll ever be able to go back to the way I used to think, but I'm happy I see things the way I do now.

This is my first trip report so it probably won't be that good but I give it a shot. 

This happened last week, I was at a festival, me and two friend had decided that we would do acid one of the first days of the festival. This was because there wasn't that many concerts giving us time to focus on more important things.
We where chilling at our tents listening to music when we dropped the acid. I was the most experienced person there and I did to hits of Tesselate's WoW, my first friend (lets call him Smally)I had tripped with once before, he also did two hits; 
the third guy was doing this his first time (Lets call him Turbo) only did one Wow (that's still 200µg). We decided to start the experience by listening to ""Portugal. The Man"" (the album in the mountain in the cloud is awesome from start to finish)
I knew that when we got to the last song (sleep forever) we would have started tripping pretty good. The perception of time got distorted as we just sat there without a care in the world. We started at about 4 pm and by 5:30 we were just sitting there watching the sun
and the cloud and the trees (remember sunglasses if you are outside kids!). Then The girls we were camping with started coming over at that time, they had planned to start drinking so they would be drunk when the concerts started later that night. 
So when  they arrived there was more conversation and they were naturally curious to what we were feeling/seeing etc. 

I was controlling the music so we were listening to things like the beatles, alt-J, the flaming lips, ratatat, of montreal, the shins, miike snow and blockhead (When tripping a like music that transitions between songs so listening to whole albums are mot unheard of)
When the people around us started getting more drunk I got some candy from my tent (individually packed chocolate bars) and the taste was unrivaled, it was like someone had sex with your mouth (in a good way)
At this point I ditched my shoes so i could feel the grass, and is was really awesome feeling. I know from experience that drunk people are not to be tripped with so I had a plan to bail when the people around me got drunk.
At this point my friend Turbo got increasingly annoying, he got frustraded because the drunk people where acting like drunk people (duh!) and at one point he threw he cashless card at one of the girls ordering her to buy a burger. (I don't really remember the context)
When he screamed (maybe he yelled), anyway I could feel the negative energy, so I gave another person control of the music and said I was gonna pee.

I grabbed my go bag and whet down to a 30 meter high hill next to the water, I climbed to the top with little effort even if I din't have shoes, and layed down on the top. I was blowing pretty fast and that sun was still pretty hot so I was just 
laying there. After the negative energy at the camp I ""reset"" my trip so it would not go bad. Looking at the sky and the clouds, the coolest part of this was when the birds where swooping over me really fast and got 5 meter long tracers (looked like worms in the sky) After I while like this I decided to go father into the woods (away from the camp and the concert area)

When walking into the woods I could really feel that the wood was alive, everything was moving and breathing and the bark on trees look like dragon scales. I found a fallen tree that I spent a good 15 minutes trying to balance on. While walking deeper into the forest I was barefoot and for 
every step i felt the ground get pushed down and lift up for every step (like the ground was breathing) and thought I was a great metaphor for the relationship between humans and earth, when you step on the earth a little it can recover okay,
but if you step in the same spot often and had the earth would not recover anymore. This caused me to arrive at the conclusion that all people that wear shoes are dirty peasants that don't appreciate the earth enough.

Now I had walked so far that I got to the end of the peninsula and arrived at a [beach](http://imgur.com/WscEfuI) made of pretty big rocks (2-10 cm i diameter) and it hurt like hell to walk on without shoes. the ocean was a deep blue color and hypnotized me with it's looks and sound and wanted to get down to the 
wateredge. on the way there I realized that on the beach someone had constructed big circles of stones (5-10 of them, the beach was pretty big) I instantly wanted to make one of my own, but got disheartening knowing my would never be as big as the [biggest](http://imgur.com/9BcARoc) (i was at least 5 m in diameter).
But i had to start somewhere so what the hell. after 5 minutes I had a small circles and when into Zen mode, but on ""Damn it feels good to be a gangster"" and put my ass in gear. every step was pain and suffering but I knew that the end result would be worth it. I knew someone had done it before me and this fact kept me going.
When i looked at the other circles of stone i saw I was like a moat around them, because they had used all the stones near the circle for building it. I told myself that I would not compromise the flatness of the area around my circle for the sake of the circle, so I went father and father for every stone. when I got a 1 Meter circle I found a lithium battery found


[HERE IS a PIC of my circle](http://imgur.com/MjA3iha)


in digital cameras laying next to some rock and decided I wanted to take it back to the recycling station near the camp as a favor to the earth. before leaving i sat down in my circle play harmonica and watching the [sun start to set](http://imgur.com/yuYGqKK) (Outside the wall by pink floyd is awesome on harmonica)



While walking back I felt I was coming down (coming down is my favorite part) and i got a glow stick from my go bag, and started spinning and playing with it (yay for tracers) I also climbed a tree next to the road and talked with it for a while (I looked pretty lonely)
I got back and after recycling the battery I decided to reconnect with a old friend I hadn't met in a year (she had been away on a exchange program) after using a good amount of time to describe the place we had our tents I finally saw her. she was in the company of her friend and her (almost-)identical twin. I was still pretty high at this point and couldn't tell the difference between the sisters.
She looked so stunning on acid that I was at a loss for words. I was contemplating telling her I was on drugs so she would understand but opted for giving her a hug and telling her what concert we should meet at later.




At this point it was 1,5 hour until the first concert we wanted to see was, and the girls we were with had decide to grill food before attending the concert. I went along just admiring everything about the world around me, I walk a little slow so the girls had to almost walk me like a dog, but they seemed to enjoy it. the entire time they were eating I was just standing there looking at stuff.
everyone probably knew I was high on something. one the way back they were talking about how cute I was and how I reminded them of a dog, I spurted out the phrase ""Dogs are always happy"" and it really caught them off guard. while I was walking back I got some One on one time with one of the girls and she was really understanding, She helped me articulate things i 
had taught earlier in the day. 

We went to the concert (I was still barefoot) I really liked the music but felt like an outcast in this environment, while you are around a lot of alcohol and partying there is always destruction, and people acting like animals.
While standing near the front of the crowd i felt I deserved this music more than them, fucking shoe wear-ers always fucking things up. when I got back to the camp after concerts I when in the shower and washed my feet, the hot water felt great and I stood there for 30 mins or something before my friend came to check if I was ok.

then we sat down where we started it all and put on the album ""the year of hibernation"" by youth lagoon while discussing our different trips (it was only me, turbo and smally at this point) when we went to bad after chilling a long time falling asleep was really hard, there was a lot of noise from around the camp.
people stumbling on our tent lines, and last but not least the closed eye visuals reminding me of tron legacy. when i finally fell asleep I had the weirdest dream where I led a revolution that ended up banning shoes, this started a domino effect that led to the betterment of all mankind. 

When I woke up the next day my feet hurt pretty bad, but ""pain is but a side effect of victory""

**TLDR:** this ended up being much longer than I intended, so read it if you want or don't, also I have some pics from that day if anybody is interested

* The house is situated in the country, out of sight from all civilization. 
* Beyond the pool is 60 acres of rolling fields and at the end is the forest treeline and beyond that, mountains of forest.
* To the side of the house is a grassy hill leading down to a beautiful brook, lined with more flowers. 
* The turning and undulating driveway is perfectly paved, lined with overhanging trees giving the illusion of a tunnel. 
* The sound system of the house allows music to be played in nearly every room of the house, including the solarium, veranda, and pool house. 

This was the setting for my (and 5 of my friends') very first acid trip. This is the follow up post to [my post from friday](http://www.reddit.com/r/LSD/comments/1imo7y/first_time_questions/). There were six 'double dosage' tabs and we each took half at about 11:45am, then took the second half an hour later or so. It was the most insane and fun day of my life. Here are some of the things we did while tripping:

* rolled down the hill in the grass
* swam in the pool (highly recommended) and floated on our backs looking up at the clouds
* hit some golf balls out into the field
* longboarded down the driveway
* tossed a frisbee, football, and soccer ball
* talked about absolute nonsense
* walked around the garden
* walked through the house and listened to the music change volume and direction as we passed from room to room
* ate a delicious variety of fruit
* stood/sat/lied in the grass and stared at the beauty of the trees and forest in the distance

All in all it was amazing. We were blessed with perfect weather: it was sunny the whole day, yet there were a lot of small clouds and lots of wind so they were moving very fast and always changing shape. The wind also made all the trees in the forest sway and dance. The sunset was very colorful, and the almost-full-moon was extremely bright. 
We all had insane visuals. I was seeing fractals everywhere, everything was dancing/swaying/breathing, colors were extremely vivid, and we were seeing and tasting rainbows as we bit into the fruits. 
Almost exactly 12 hours later we were feeling very close to sober and decided to pop some mdma and raged for another 4 hours.

The popcorn ceiling in my living room looked like a pattern or kaleidoscope type image but was only made up of white (the ceiling color) and its shadows and shades.

Trails. Pretty typical, but waving hands and cars far away would give trails.

Trees and small hills became bubbly. They would bulge in and out and back and forth, slowly morphing.

Clouds (ahhhh clouds) would morph shapes but not into anything specific, almost as if they changed to a ""different"" cloud.

I never actually saw anything, it was just small altered things, and usually i had to stare to notice (does that mean i had a low dose?)

I'm sorry if these explanations don't make sense, but it's hard to describe!

I have had 2 tabs of acid wrapped in aluminium foil in a pill bottle lying in my draw for around 12 months now (it was kept in a freezer for about 6 months before I moved somewhere else).  

I'm heading out to a sold out club DJ set this weekend and have read about taking VERY low level doses of LSD is great for a party environment.  Not a moderate dose, because that will leave you anxious in such an environment...but a super low dose, like 1/4 to 1/8 of a tab will supposedly leave one with subtle prolonged euphoria.

My question is, has anyone had experience with using LSD in a party situation and would you agree with ~1/8 of a tab, keeping the dose very very low?

Also, would the acid have degraded much and will I need to factor this into how much board I cut off a tab?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.. I'd hate to become an anxious wreck in the club, lol.  

Ps. I have tripped multiple times before :)

It was 25i-NBOMe. I'm posting this here because I'm not sure- /r/psychonaut seems to focus more on using psychedelics as tools of learning compared to using them recreationally.

He has taken a variety of psychedelics before, 25i included and he would have problems sometimes but still maintain control of his body.

That night.. Well I thought I had lost a friend to drugs because it was like the fucking end of the world. He thought he died, and that he went to hell and I don't know what entirely because he says he forgot... but it's just so hard to forget.

He shot himself with an imaginary pistol and went fucking dead limp. @\_@ It was an extremely busy night and the taxi was moving at something like 100 metres every minute (no, seriously. :| ) and in the taxi he would scream out shit like ""no no no"" and he looked as if his mind was being distorted @\_@ he looked like he was going to spew his guts and brains out (like his face was that intense) but nothing.. except that his mouth made this glog glog crap sound...

There's other stuff to this trip... but I don't want to think about it too much because it was just too traumatising.

I feel paranoid as fuck, because I can't comprehend how a person can have gone through all that and still be the same person... but at the same time because he doesn't remember it is wrong for me to disregard his mental state.

I don't think i'll be touching psychedelics again for a while -- there's too many things that could go wrong due to anxiety.

I don't know what else to write here, /r/LSD, ... how do you forget seeing someone die over and over again in so many different ways just without dying? D:

And yes, half is past-tense, half is in present-tense. Sorry 'bout it!

At 10:30pm, I dropped a 100µg tab and kept it in my mouth for 15 minutes before swallowing (just to be safe).

(11:00pm) About 30 minutes passes, it's 11:00 now and I don't really notice much of a change. If anything, I feel a *slight* perception change. I put some chillstep/chillwave music on at this point, and listened with my audiotechnica ATH-M50 headphones.

(11:15pm) About 15 more minutes pass and I began to really start to feel a change in my perception. The carpet was breathing softly, the light would do strange things out of the corner of my eye. The music is starting to sound really good, and I gradually increase the volume until it's turned all the way up. It sounds AMAZING at this point, and I can't stop smiling. I notice that my mood was INCREDIBLE, my emotions were extremely exaggerated, and I was loving it.

(11:45pm) I guess I was listening to music for quite awhile because I didn't take my headphones off for another 30 minutes. This is when things started going downhill. I noticed my dog was barking uncontrollably upstairs at something, and my mom -- who was passed out because she takes ambien -- wasn't letting her out. My emotions changed from euphoric and happy to anger and rage in a split second, and I yelled at my dog to shut up. She stopped, and I put my headphones back in.

(12:00am) I mute my headphones to see if my dog has resumed barking, and surely enough, she was. I controlled my emotions and calmly walked upstairs. I spoke very softly to her and essentially tried reasoning with her. Whatever I did, it worked and she calmed down. I was actually cracking up by the end of talking with her, because I was reasoning with a fucking dog. LOL!

(12:15am) I'm back listening to music. I'm talking to a friend on facebook who knew I dropped acid, and he was sending me stuff to listen to. Everything sounded AWESOME. And I mean EVERYTHING. The way I can describe it is that the ""filter"" that would normally dictate what I considered ""good"" and ""bad"" music was gone; I could appreciate ALL music for just being music.

(1:00am) My friend on facebook decides he is going to bed, and I decide that I'm going to watch the movie I had picked out (Yellow Submarine (1968)). Let me just say that this is by far the BEST movie I could've chosen to watch out of anything. If you have never seen it while tripping, PLEASE watch it the next time you are.

(1:00-3:30am?ish) I watched the whole movie and could not stop smiling and laughing at it's pure brilliance. At this time I'm starting to feel pretty sober and considered taking an ambien so I could sleep.

A really good friend of mine called and convinced me to come over to his house and hangout with my other best friends. Last night was actually my prom, but I had cancelled my date for unrelated reasons and didn't go (so I tripped instead, I still wanted last night to be a landmark in time!). So one of my friends picked me up and I went over and talked with all of them. They asked me a little about my trip (none of them experienced with psychedelics), and I gladly shared some of my experiences.

They were drinking casually, but I knew better. It was too soon after tripping to put any alcohol down. After about an hour and a half nearly everyone had fallen asleep except me (who was still feeling alert) and this other girl, who is a good friend of mine. I was feeling quite sober from the LSD and was able to drink a few shots with her.

By this time it's like 6 AM, and we go upstairs because the sun seems to be coming out. Except it wasn't, because it was cloudy as hell. I won't lie, I'm not a very big dude and I don't drink often, so I was pretty tipsy. We went and jumped on the trampoline in the backyard which is something that I will never forget. I jumped on a trampoline while tipsy after an LSD trip on my prom night.

We came back inside and essentially cuddled in the spare spare bedroom because it was cold, but never got to sleep since we had to get up at 7:00am. (My friend's parents were going to be home). Someone drove me home and I finally ended up passing out at about 8:00am in my own bed.

1363759297.0,24,self.LSD,1andap,Trip Report : my first experience back in '97,27,3,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/LSD/comments/1andap/trip_report_my_first_experience_back_in_97/,"Hi Everyone, sense this subreddit is bogged down with first timers asking questions instead of writing what happens after they take LSD. I thought I'd set an example and share my first trip. 

Way back before RCs were passed as LSD, my girl and I went to a small get together at a friends house. It was mostly dudes, about 8 of us, and it was kinda boring. I ask my friend that lived there if he had any drugs besides weed. At first he said ""no"" then it dawned on him that he had some acid. It was a was a shock to even him; because he had forgotten about it. About two years earlier he was selling it and a 10strip slipped between two parts of his stereo. We proceeded to take apart the stereo and sure enough, there it was.  

Out of the six of us that decided to take it, I was the only LSD rookie, but I had shroom'd a few times before and my expires fed friends mostly said ""it was the same."" (I don't think they are the same in many ways) Anyway, myself and an other good friend were over excited and took two tabs each, not being smart enough to know anything about dose sizes at all. We put on Austin powers to kill time and laugh. About a half hour later the other four people decided to drop too. 

When it first hit me, for some reason I got real tired and tried to fall asleep on my girls lap. I immediately start CEVs that are wild and reptilian in nature. My head feels like it's being absorbed into my girls lap, and her skin feels scaled. I get swallowed into blackness and feel like I walk through a door. I immediately ""wake up"" and I'm tripping balls and Austin Powers is just about to end.  The other guy that had taken two hits was chain smoking in the backyard and the 4 that took it later looked like they were about to blast off! 

I get up and go talk to the other guy on 2hits chain smoking. He was tripping face too and was pissed at me for falling asleep. We talk for a bit and then the others are at back door telling us ""it's time to smoke"" 

We all go into the garage and start a session. My girl looks amazing to me and I'm all lovey dovey. After a few hits I'm in a whole other headspace that is indescribable. My girl starts talking to me asking if she should take one of the remaining doses, and I manage to say ""no"" not sure if I'd need a ride home or not yet. Then we try talking about what to do but I just can't talk at all. My words are mush and I almost feel drunk. I turn to one of my friends that is also tripping and speak effortlessly to him saying ""I can't talk to her for some reason"".  My girl shouts out ""WTF? Are u alright"" I then said something that only made it worse... ""You were so cool a minute ago but I think I need you to leave"" she was offended, but I knew she did not need to stick around for the crazies that were coming. 
My girl leaves and I return to the trippers circle of pot smoking in the garage. We are all starting to go off the rails now and everyone is commenting how strong the acid was in comparison to previous experiences. I knew no different, I know now (having tripped many times sense and knowing the approximate doses) that those tabs had to have been at least 250ug a piece. 

We sat and smoked in that garage for hours on end. We'd have on just a black light for a while then switch back to the regular lights, and it would totally sway the visuals and vibe in all directions. At one point under the black light, my friend looked like a man/rat, like splinter from tmnt, and  then stayed that way for a while, while he moved around and talked. I laughed hysterically at this. One of the craziest things I experienced was the feeling of ""thinking"" from my left knee. Basically it felt like my consciousness, for a while, was centered in my left knee. Impossible to explain.  

Other highlights, 'cause this is getting long. With all the lights off in the house, staring up at the test light on a fire detector, that little point of light would flash every sec or so, and when it flashed I would see a thirteen story high mech cube (looked like the borg ship from star trek) suspended above the room. 

I stood in the bathroom pulling bites of chrome off the door handle and watching them bubble and disappear for what felt like 30min and only decided to leave the bathroom because I thought I heard a friend call to me... Which he didn't do at all. 

At a late point in the night we all tried to sleep and I had amazing Closed Eyes Experiences. Visuals don't do it justice. There was all sorts of spacial and tactile feelings to the experiences. I pictured/felt my body being reassembled in tiny chunks like in the 5th element, and I remember being in a cube of mirrors that represented my personal choices and timelines. 

It may have been the most intense acid trip I've ever had because it was my first time, or it was just the strongest cleanest I've ever had.  Anyway, having knowingly taken approx 400ug sense then, I know it was more then that and I know it was LSD, but I really don't desire to go to that level again. 

Since I've become wiser, I always test my LSD before I consume and I advise the same. Test kits are worth the piece of mind rookies!",,False,,t5_2qhvj,False,,,True,t3_1andap,http://www.reddit.com/r/LSD/comments/1andap/trip_report_my_first_experience_back_in_97/,

(Long read, with TLDR)",26,1,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/LSD/comments/12ki17/weed_high_super_intense_after_dropping_acid_is/,"Me and my friend dropped acid at a party exactly 7 days ago. We each took 3 hits, which we were told would get us pretty fucked up.


However, it wasn't that amazing. It was a really ""speedy"" high where I couldn't stop moving around or thinking about things but it was not very visual at all. Some things appeared to be moving that weren't and my friend's face started to change into sort of monster looking things but that was very brief and the most visual thing that occurred.


All in all the acid trip was honestly kind of boring, I don't know if we took very small dosages or if what we took was something other than LSD.


The craziness occurred last night. Me and about 5 other people were sitting on my friends sofa smoking weed (my first time smoking since I dropped acid) and I tripped way harder than I did when on acid. I only smoked one joint too. I have smoked 3 grams by myself before and never felt anything close to this.  I am very confident it could not have been the weed.


My mind started going places completely outside the room. For a solid ten minutes I was thinking about the life of some random lady in a shopping mall. I could literally see the products she was shopping for, see her kids standing by her side. It was insane! I mean I wasn't seeing this stuff through my eyes, it was all in my head. In fact I couldn't see much of anything through my eyes, everything looked too bright, like if you spend all day in absolute darkness then walk outside at noon. That little layer of blinding light that covers everything was making it impossible to see anything in my friends living room.


Eventually, things became so awkward between me and my friends because I could not speak a single word, none the less hold a conversation, I just got up and left.


Except it became even more awkward because once I got in my car I sat in his driveway for fucking 40 minutes thinking I was on an airplane! I could hear the airplane engine and see the people sitting next to me and everything. Then the plane crashed and I was kind of reborn in my car at which point I made the short drive home.


At home I just laid in my bed for about an hour and contemplated the universe with my eyes closed. Things were very clear and visual to me. I basically came to the conclusion the entire universe centered around me and now it was my turn to ascend to my realm, like my time on Earth was a test. At one point I imagined that a single second was the end of my timeline, and as that second expired I went back to the exact moment I was born and had lived this life thousands of times without realizing it, it's very hard to remember now but back then it made perfect sense.


All in all, that feeling lasted maybe 2 hours then I just felt kind of stony and sat around playing Dota 2.


Sorry it was such a long read but is any of that possible at all? Even I am having a hard time believing it. All my friends who have done shrooms/acid/etc have never reported any of that and I have researched/googled the fuck out of it without finding anything. 




TLDR; Took acid, next time I smoked weed was super intense, thousands of times more intense than the acid trip itself, felt like what the acid trip SHOULD have been.

Friend One didn't really want to cut his tab in half, but since friend two shared with friend three it ultimately went so we all got half a tab (tho, me and friend one got the biggest pieces).

We went for a smokebreak and everyone naturally tried to look for the effects, besides the slight headrush / placebo of knowing we took it, nothing happened ofcourse.

We went in to the livingroom and started to watch Pink Floyd - The wall (movie) and hoped the effects would kick in really soon, but as friend one told us, you can't force it, so just let it come to you.

I had seen the movie a few times before, and had listened to the album way too much lately, thanks to a coverband project so I started to draw something. We had a UV-Blacklight so the mood was really chill. Sometime into the drawing I started to get some effect: I didn't draw anywhere near the way I usually do, the pen just moved naturally and everything seemed normal. Friend one watched me while I drew it and I think it kicked in at the same time for both of us. 

Then everyone started sweating like hot showers, we talked and had a pretty good time right then. I started to make connections about pretty much everything and got very, very easely distracted, cool spots on the wall, a cool painting, the cat in the house suddenly coming in to the room etc. My friend started to tickle me and it felt like I fell from a cliff. Don't get me wrong, I was fully aware of where I was and what was happening, but the constant feeling of falling was so intense and real. 

Then nothing special happened, just talking for half an hour, watching some tv, youtube, music etc - and then we went to jam some music. Everyone was really into it, even though it was a trainwreck to listen to, then friend two's aunt came in and told us something. Oh, I forgot. Everyone was tripping really hard by this point and sweating; so we all were shirtless - might be weird to see. At that moment I got really paranoid and very nervously touchy. If I saw the cat suddenly behind me I would jump and yell, this continued for the rest of my night.

His uncle came in later, but was drunk and probably didn't know anything (or might have, I'm pretty sure he have tried everything in his life), but me and Friend one got really paranoid and scared. We then went on to get a sober friend to join us, just so he could manage situations like that, and keep us company.

After getting him there, me and friend one got really intense in the house, so we decided to go for a ""picnic"". We went on to sit in a circular spot in the road (that cars have to drive around) and drank a few beers, talked and just had an amazing experience just knowing where we actually were. 

In the middle of the road, in the middle of fucking nowhere; Norway, we were two dudes sitting, drinking beer, smoking cigarettes and trying to open a orange with a lighter. It was the best goddamn feeling in the world. We saw some lights in the distance and wanted to check it out. Turns out the local bowling ally had a party night so we somehow decided to go play. Playing bowling with intense party music, black light, strobe light and a lazershow - all while tripping pretty hard on acid was one of the most fun things I've ever done in my life. We went back home, sweating an awful amount and all that jazz.

Then I really don't remember anything specific. Mostly talking, watching tv, playing games for a few hours, went for a long walk, smoked waaaay to many cigs and had a really chill time. We busted the cat in the house of really being a human being trapped in a cats body, because he knew way to much about how we reacted to stuff (ok, just funny). 

Then we watched pinapple express and wanted to smoke some hash, but we didn't have any so we just watched the movie and then went home. We had then been on lsd for 12 hours, and everyone still felt the effects, not as strong as the first few hours, but seriously nothing to take for granted.

I came home at 07/08 in the morning and was still tripping, I could not sleep and the room was really interesting. My mind was really thoughtfull and interesting so I didn't get to sleep until 11:00. Best night of my fucking life, no doubt about it.

Sorry for rambling, but I really had to get it out there. I really don't know how potent the stuff we got was, but a big half tab got everyone tripping for 12 hours straight - so looking forward to the next time with another friend joining in and everyone taking a whole tab.

TL;DR - Had the best night of my life, learned alot about myself and my friends and just had a really good time.",,False,,t5_2qhvj,False,,,True,t3_rct2h,http://www.reddit.com/r/LSD/comments/rct2h/first_trip_yesterday_an_amazing_experience/,

The mellow friend and I played guitar while my fellow traveler showed us the way. It was beautiful. Before the trip I was blinded. Blinded by the dreary existence of what the drink traps you in.

I have all I need to get me to my dream. It took me so long to realize this. I was always living in fear. Fear of the uncertain. Fear of judgement. Fear of nothing. I now see the light, for it has presented itself to me. It will always be there when I am at my most problematic hour. It will remind me that hard work and justice will pay off.

I thought it was rain, but when I looked back, there was a circle of people that really stood out from the crowd and they were dressed over the top in ""hippie"" clothing. I was already a little trippy, but I felt like they waved something at me. I looked back and I felt like some were looking back at me but I had to follow my friends to the next stage of music.

*Were they one of the families that produce the stuff?

*Who the heck has liquid LSD on hand?


I had a **great** time and don't know whether to be mad or thank them!


EDIT: Sure, it's possible this was all imagined because of tripping, but a few things make me feel strongly that this had happend. I thought it was water at first, until I realized the slight burn/electric/tingle feeling on my arm and cheek. I had an optimistic attitude right after and thought if it is, it is, and I'm about to trip harder, and if not, then it wasn't. I didn't feel like I was doomed to trip harder. But between the very different feeling of the liquid that I felt all day on my arm and cheek, the way that circle of people looked, the fact that I started to trip significantly harder 3 hours after my initial tab drop, I just lean closer to the fact that I was sprinkled with two drops of liquid acid.

Everyone is feeling the same feeling when they're around you.  
The general atmophere is shared by all.   It is not something that we experience as individual experiencers.

'Two people are together and the feeling changes in the room.'  
--&gt;What does this mean?

This is the feeling that I'm talking about.  The feeling is something we all do at the same time. Me over here, you over there.  We're all feeling the same feeling.  Sure it feels different over here compared to where you are over there, but its really all the same feeling.  The situation is different over here than it is over there, that's why it feels different.   

Its an illusion to think that we're separate experiencers.  There is only the one experiencer, and this is the universe.  The illusion of separate experience is made stronger when we  humans isolate themselves from others.  When we isolate ourselves we don't *have* to feel the general ""feeling"" in the atmosphere that is apparent during a face to face confrontation.  It's angry over Jim's neck of the woods.  We don't feel that because we're not right there in the thick of it, but that doesn't change the fact that it still feels very angry over there.  

Notice Jim doesn't feel angry.  It feels angry in the area we call ""Jim"".  *It*, being the universe.  

When two people talk they are forced to confront the ""feeling"" in the room together.  It is a ""feeling *with*"" someone.  To think that one sometimes feels *with* and at other times feels solo would be a mistake.  People have a tendency to separate themselves and go off feeling the world on their own.  This can sometimes make one think that one is in it alone, when truly we all share the same air of feeling, its just a matter of how open we are to it.

.


The journey has only just began.  But I had no idea what awaits.

Headphones on.  Music will show me the way.

So familiar.  But so much deeper.  It's everywhere.

 .


Eyes closed.

Beanbag

 .


&gt;Sounds I had never heard before... But I had listened to this 100 times.  Must be another wave length.

The subtle notes are important.  They are not just background noise.

In fact the background noise is the most important.  It is keeping me grounded... The guitar is pulling me away .. out ... up...

 .


Things get faster... no colours though .. infact white.. very white.

White is scary... Sign of death.  But I am not scared.  It's not real.  I'm sure.

 .


&gt;Each note is now a fragment of time.  The gaps in-between are void.

Each note is further away from my body.  Is this safe?  Where am I going?

&gt;&gt;I must hold on to the background noise.

 .


I've hit a wall .. my room is holding me... It doesn't want to let go.  Time snaps back together

Headphones off... 

&gt;Everything is very slippery...

I want to go... I trust the music.

I trust if the music takes me .. It will bring me home.

 .


Exhale.

&gt;And things where never the same again.

&gt;Life changing.

 .


This may be too much... I have to trust the music.

I put my headphones on.... and then I put my headphones on.

That was weird.

 .


Looking at my roof... It's taking me... I can't hold on to the ambient background noise any longer.

It literately opens up like the heavens .. a portal.

&gt;I'm almost laughing at this point... Smiling so much ... I know what's coming ..

&gt;Take me.

 .


I close my eyes...Preparing myself.

Instantly time starts to fall apart again... I'm riding the guitar notes through time .. towards the white .. and through it.

Just as long as I have the background noise I am safe... It tells me where home is... so I can leave.

 
.

.

 

I don't know where I am .. but I am far far away.

 .


There is nothing... no colours ... no feelings... no breathing.

wait.. no breathing.. I must remember to breath.

As I check... I feel the air in my lungs.. My body is in a bubble.

My body is not important... It will take care of it self.

The bubble vanishes .. I know I can bring it back to check on it... It doesn't worry me.

 .


All there is, is the guitar pushing me further and further away, one instance of time at a time.

&gt;and the background noise keeping me safe... reminding me of home. 

earth.

 .


The notes are forming a spiral... I can see each instance of time ... as I float past each one I hear it.

Slower.. faster.. louder...directions, It's all relative to time.

This is great.  I can control this.  And I know my body is safe.

 .


&gt;&gt;&gt;And then suddenly... the background noise stops ...

All reality I know vanishes behind me. 

&gt;It's like ... Imagine your a kid... on a bike for the very first time... and your parents are holding/pushing you ... you trust them

&gt;Everything is fun your having a good time.. your safe.

&gt;And then they let go... 

That freedom.  But I'm not slowing down.

Now I am worried.

 .


I know this guitar ends soon .. What If I took my headphones off...

I know I could... Things are very very intense.

If I take them off .. I lose..

I trust the music.

I start smiling again.

Give me all you've got.

 .


I experience what can only be described as the most amazing ending to a song there ever was.

 .


Ahhh it's over ... and the ambient noise is back!  but this time It's here with me ...

but wait .. where is here?

 .


&gt;&gt;&gt;So pure, not a single ray of light could find it's way through.

 .


This ambient noise is nice.

Wait .. What's that infront of me... and around me... I hear .. factory sounds .. and squealing.

A colour! Red... things are turning red... and hot.

I look down .. I'm not sure how I know that it is down .. being I am a orb in 3 dimensional space.

Fire!

 .


Wait .. I'm in something .. like a carriage in a conveyor belt but suspended.  Very cyber punk esk.

There's a feeling of a presents in the distance to the side of me... I can't really see it... looking towards it I only see ambient shapes.

&gt;It's defiantly some kind of anti-god.

&gt;It's defiantly looking at me.

&gt;It's defiantly getting closer.

 .


The squealing getting louder...

Screaming starts in the sound ... normally it would be very prominent I recognise the song ... but it just blends into the background noise... The industrial sounds overpower everything.

 .


I see other carriages like mine in the distance ... they are on fire.  This is where the squealing is coming from?

&gt;I have a shield that protects me.  It's like I'm not meant to be here.  Nothing seams to effect me.

 .


&gt;The figure feels like he's getting closer and closer but I can't tell I can only sense.

I think he's screaming at me.

His anger is terrifying.

 .


This lasts awhile.

 .


I think I need a break... This is too much.

&gt;I take my headphones off, and then a few seconds later, I take my headphones off,

I open my eyes.

woah.

mmm

I can still here the screaming. I could stop it.

But wait ummm ... where am I.  This feels very unfamiliar.

I'm on my beanbag but... I'm not ready to be here ... I'm somewhere far far away in space and time... Coming back like this is cheating.

I can see writing on the screen... The writing... it,, Isn't in english ..  I can't make it out.

and colours ... colours are .. out .... They are not what they are supposed to be.

I'm not ready for this place... I have to go back.

.
 

The music has changed .. IT immediately takes me away.  I'm gone again.

 .


&gt;Wait I recognise more of this sound .. It's .. It's the first song .. but BACKWARDS....

This is so amazing ... All I can do is considerate on the song now ... It's actually becoming more happy .. as it becomes happy.. the red fades away.

.. I have to tell people of this experience.  This get me thinking ... Going back .. if that wasn't back.. where was it.. was that my lounge?

 .


I'm trying to figure out consciousness.. and how I can be so far away from my body ... It's not even about distance.. It's about feeling.

I'm a little worried that I will never get home .. but then I remember I trust the music .. I must tell other people of this experience.

That seams very .. very important .. other people must know ... that seams like my only ticket home.

 .


But for now I am further away then ever.

 .


Patterns start appearing around me.. In sync with the song.  It's like .. I'm inside a spaceship... It's very dark and cold I can hardly make anything out.

&gt;I have a body.. my body .. It's here with me .. for the first time. 

I'm lying down ... Same position I would be on the bean bag ... I can't move.

There's figures moving around beside me..

 .


I look down ... I'm half dissected.  Theres blood and tissue hanging out everwhere.

&gt;&gt;The song lets me know everything is okay.

From my shoulders down I completely open.  There is machines above me with hundreds of points... It's like they are working on me .. operating on me.

It feels like they are enhancing me. 

 .


I just lye there.

 .


When I look up I start seeing information.. I'm looking at what seams to be a holigram that goes are far as I can see ...

almost like a map.. almost like stars... 

 .


I can make it out ..

It's Hexes ... like DNA .. It's all around me at the moment.  But it's split up... As I get close to one it looks like hundreds of tiny capsules.  I must figure this out.

I look back down ... now I am in one of these capsules .. floating around.. I get closer and closer to these hexes ... until I match up with one...  I slot in .. perfectly.

These capsules .. They have the presents of people!  I cant see in they are just white ... Infact I can't even see my body again.

 .


Then something strange happens .. I leave my capsule and start floating past others ... the one immidiatly above me I reconize ... It's [Friends/flatmates name here]!

I float past more and more and .. I can hear talking and thoughts on the inside ... I can even see people moving inside some of them .. like a TV.

&gt;&gt;But wait ... I look back and I can see my capsule and .. I start to forget ... I start to forget who I am.

 .


As I relies this all the hexes start moving again ... my capsule is long gone.

I still have the same persona... But if I try to remember any details about myself... I struggle.

&gt;The music tells me this is okay.

 .


As I float around absorbing the beauty of the building blocks of life, I relies I can even float through these hexes and think other peoples thoughts, feel other peoples feelings.  Nobody I know...It's all a huge jumble.

 .


The music changes again .. back to factory sounds ... but it gets very quite..

&gt;I'm back in the same place as before...  What would be described as hell.

Still not afraid.

 .


I can now tell I am slipping away ... That I may never come back.. That maybe the music doesn't have me after all.

Red ... fire... etc.

 .


The prominate creature approaches me again .. but this time seams like he is communicating..

&gt;&gt;""This is it.  Your free. You can go.""

I can't tell if his motives are pure.  But it honestly feels like I could break free ... and I would be gone from this life forever.

&gt;The song is very very quite now .. and for the first time .. I don't think I could take my headphones off .. even if I really needed too.

.
 

The gravity of my options.

I considered my options.

 .


""No.

I must tell people of this experience... It is too important.. Everybody must know... Everybody must experience it.""

 .


##So here I am.  Spreading the tale of my journey.  What happened next isn't really that important.  The music comes back.. Gets louder... The spaceship comes back and give me my pod and I come back to earth .. my earth.  And I spend until this point right now thinking about this experience constantly, knowing I need to tell as many people as possible.  Needing to tell everyone.  It took me about x5 longer to write this then it did to experience it... I'm not sure writing is my best communication tool.  I'm not sure what is.  I dont know that there is anything to learn from my story, I just know that It needs to be told.

We were talking about tripping before we both go back to school, but this time we were thinking of spending a day in the city, going to museums and the park and etc. This would involve taking public transit (mainly subway).

I really want to do this but I'm afraid of being around people when tripping. We ordered a pizza one night and when the delivery guy got there I wanted to hide under the couch.

It was my spring break this week, so three friends and I decided to do an impromptu road trip to charleston SC. We all took 1.5 tabs of very good acid. In about 30 minutes, it hit all of us hard. We had planned to go to an aquarium, but the world around it was just to damn interesting and we wound up for the first thirty minutes of the trip sitting next to the aquarium in a small patch of sand, not knowing how to handle ourselves. After about thirty minutes, I was getting anxious so we decided to walk around the city. Mind you during this time we decided barefoot was the way to go so we wound up walking around Charleston ( a pretty rich, very beautiful historic place if you have never been) without shoes. I felt so connected to the earth and the people around me simply by feeling the earth under my feet. As we walked around, my anxiety faded away and was replaced with a sense of energy, happiness, and awe as we walked through the town. our group split up and me and a friend decided to explore the town while my other friend and his girlfriend stayed in a park the whole time. We wound up talking to a lot of strangers and I'm still not sure if I made sense half the time. By looking into people's eyes, I felt as if I could read them very well and sense their immediate thoughts about me when I talked to them. After a couple of hours, me and my friend stumbled into this beautiful courtyard of this hotel and who do we run into but the owner. He reeked of money and was very suspicious of two shoe-less hippies walking into his hotel. but after talking to him, he could tell our intentions were pure so he let us be. All of the historic churches, beautiful palm trees, and beautiful people made me feel as if I was in paradise. We wound up meeting back up with our friends and walking to a pier to stare at the water. We could see the water move from schools of fish being chased by this dolphin. It was surreal to say the least. The acid wore off, and we continued with our spring break, but during my trip I had a lot of time to reflect on my life and the purpose I give it.

what I learned---

we are all equal, the hotel owner is no better than some high shoe-less college student, as the high shoe-less college student is no better than the homeless man begging for something better. 

I am more grateful than ever for all I have in my life. My parents are great and I felt a strong connection to my mom even though she was miles away. 

I want to help people with my life. I'm studying engineering and my goal is to work on sustainable energy so we don't have to destroy the environment in order to live well. 

material possessions are nice, but they mean nothing to our lives. our friends, family, and neighbors are all we ever have in life, and they should be cherished. 

all life is holy. from a rat to a human, we are all amazing products of the environment, and all should be respected. 

life is complicated, scary, and overwhelming at times. I am still pondering my own faith, but I believe there is more to this reality than what we see. I believe there is something deeper, as if the entire fabric of the universe is ordered into one single being which some call god. 

all of these thoughts were running through my head the entire day, but the most prominent one was of my family and friends. I was overwhelmed with a feeling of gratitude and love for my parents, and really wanted to hug them the entire day. I almost cried that day just thinking of how lucky I have been being granted with such loving parents, and felt terrible that many people grow up without that luxury.

1355084696.0,22,self.LSD,14k91t,Discuss philosophy: How deep does the rabbit hole go?,32,10,42,http://www.reddit.com/r/LSD/comments/14k91t/discuss_philosophy_how_deep_does_the_rabbit_hole/,"Note: This submission is for those wanting to discuss philosophy. Naturally much reading is involved. Just a friendly warning. I really hope not too many people run away, though! So, here we go...

I'm still relatively new to psychedelics but my last two trips (one on LSD, the other on mushrooms) were extremely profound and were filled with mindfucks and revelations. These revelations deal with reality, existence, language, and love. I feel that I'm foraying into new territory that is starting to alienate me socially and I find this a little troubling. I'm posting this to r/LSD to hear your guys' thoughts on where/how far the rabbit hole has taken you. Should be quite interesting and I hope to spark some deep thoughts here so don't be afraid to type away! Below I will share some things I've learned and how they have put me into this troubled state I'm in.

It will help you to know that I'm a huge fan of Terence McKenna, as I'm sure many of you are as well. Whenever I get the chance I listen to his talks on YouTube. This is pretty much where it starts for me. He basically has ""taught"" me -- when I was on the come-downs of my LSD trip and mushroom trip I spent most of them inside my head remembering Terence's words and connecting the dots on how the universe works and the role of life/humans. Hearing him describe that the world is made of language and that language is HUMAN TECHNOLOGY has quite literally changed the world I lived in. He says true magic exists with/through/from language, whatever that means. On these come-downs I was breaking down and simplifying everything. One of the ""keys"" I found was the significance of CONNECTION. Existence is possible through connection and interaction, I want to say. That is why as intelligent species humans have developed language. Language is there to connect our minds, allowing us to share thoughts, share emotions, and innovate. Terence describes this as a form of telepathy and I totally agree. Mark Pesce said, ""We are linguistic creatures first and foremost...(language) is how we are."" I now see that LOVE naturally falls in with connection/language. Love is a powerful word indeed. I'm still trying to have a deeper understanding of love but I'm sure that if/when I do, it will extremely difficult to translate to words anyway (as it already is, haha).

Bleh, I'm already running out of steam; I hate writing. But at least I highlighted some key thoughts. Other stuff my mind has been on:

- the eschaton (the end)
- existence of aliens (What's all this Pleiadian stuff?)
- Government conspiracy (Chemtrails, Illuminati)
- connections to the Christianity (I'm agnostic/atheist)

As you can see, anyone discussing these topics are usually labeled as ""loony."" The eschaton is something I've thought about a lot especially since Terence said it will happen on the 21st of this month. Everyone can rationally accept that everything will eventually come to an end, including the earth, but no one ever accepts that this can happen in their lifetime. I see the logic of the eschaton, I think. Most people describe the event as a singularity. And if you think about the evolution of humans and technology, you will see that everything is becoming more and more connected, especially since the invention of the Internet. Marc Pesce said this phenomenon will bring about a ""global awareness"" or ""self-realization"" or something. So it all kinda makes sense, although I don't think we're quite there yet.

But let me wrap this up. As you can see, my mind has been open to so much. But all this comes at a cost: loneliness (which affects love/happiness). I feel that I'm becoming a little alienated. My thoughts will explore all these huge, big-picture things like the eschaton while everyone around me is just occupied with doing well on their college finals (so am I, mind you lol). Sometimes I feel the need to vomit all my thoughts onto someone's mind but I know most of my friends wouldn't last 1 minute in a conversation or would just think I'm a crazy hippy. I love the psychedelic experience but I'm suddenly a little bit frightened again. I basically feel that with psychedelics I'm traveling a shamanic path. And I guess I'm a little scared of where and how far this path will take me. However, I have 5 dried grams of psilocybe cubensis in my desk drawer...

It was effing awesome! 

**12:40:** So, we dropped it, and took the stereotypical ""acid on our tongues"" pic. Our supposed sitter actually had class all day, but we felt pretty safe and ready, and we weren't going to think about it. If we felt like crossing the street, well, we'd cross the street by ourselves. If not, the room was fine.

We took it and went for a walk, and ran into our weed dealer while sitting on the grass by a river near his dorm. He said we looked ""guilty"" but we just laughed it off without letting it out. We walked around the campus, visiting a mini ampitheather that caused an echo, as well as other outdoor areas full of trees.  I wasn't nearly as confused as last time, even though I was tripping just as hard, so I managed to be a good guide. We walked back to her apartment.

We had bought a rainbow pinwheel, as well as a glitter ball and plenty of supplies. My friend was wondering if the acid was really going to work or not, and I could already feel it slightly creeping up. Besides, we spent almost a half hour trying to make the pinwheel spin, placing it in different spots on the ground outside, and going back inside to look at it through the bedroom window. I knew it had started.

She wanted to eat a cookie, but as we headed into the kitchen, I gave her a strawberry to try. She bit into it, and her eyes widened. ""…wow."" It tasted so different.

**13:30**: It was hitting us hard about 45min later. Things started breathing and moving, and the euphoria was hard to control. We drew for a bit, and looked around things in the room.

I decided we had to go outside, and although I am sure we did just fine walking across campus and crossing the street, my heart was racing constantly and the heat felt uncomfortable. Everything was beautiful, bright, and shiny, and the half mile walk seemed to take so much longer than normal. All I wanted was to sit down and enjoy the feeling i was trying to hold down so hard. I tried to talk about commonplace things to keep myself and my friend down to earth until we reached a safe spot. A few cars and trucks drove by- the people's faces seemed to be judging us and almost turning into monsters out of the corner of my eye, but i knew it was all in my mind. We walked and walked, through the quiet sidewalk under branches and canopies of trees, around palm trees, gardens, fountains, lawns, plants, tall grass, until we reached the beach. Things were slightly more purple and magenta, and keeping focused was difficult.

The beach was the most amazing visual experience. There were a handful of people we quickly walked away from, finding a more distant spot in the corner of the area. We sat under a palm tree, plugged in our music and watched. 

Wow.

We kept talking about how we saw those ""timelapses of clouds rolling by really fast from the movies"" in real life. I can't explain it more perfectly than that. I had never seen the outdoors while peaking, and we were definitely there now. It was about 2:45. 

The beach was also a little scary. I was keeping my cool, we were both listening to music while tracers and every natural thing was beautiful. But in the back of my mind I was a little paranoid with the cars passing by not more than 30ft away (even though they couldn't really see us). I felt we looked sketchy just sitting there staring at the water, and our sitting was extremely uncomfortable. We couldn't lay down because of the rocks. I absolutely loved watching birds fly, fish, leaves fall, and fish jump out of the water.  I wanted to keep pointing every single thing I saw to her, but each of us was listening to different music and appreciating different things, sharing something every now and then. Everything was extremely intense, every sound, every action took so much effort, every voice echoed, every car seemed to be stopping behind us. But, every flying fish, sailing boat, rolling cloud moved beautifully to the music and shimmered with life. Dragonflies zoomed past and around us, and birds loomed over our heads. The wind would come and go, hitting the quiet inter coastal water and creating ripples that multiplied and expanded out into the water and into the rest of our fields of vision.
My friend thought it was super intense, but loved it. She swears she saw a dolphin.

**15:30:** Finally, we walked back. It was way too intense to handle, and we were running out of water in 100 degree weather. 

...Oh. and the roommates parents came to a surprise visit. We heard their voices, but just decided to stay in her room and paint. We both ran into them and cooked while they were in the kitchen with no problem. It made my friend a little uncomfortable but I got her out of there as soon as possible.

I laid out watercolors, acrylics, and some really smooth hot press paper. My friend loved painting. I did a little bit of it, but my favorite medium is charcoal, so I wasn't as into it as she was. It was hard to keep focused or even produce what my mind wanted to on the paper since I don't practice with paint much. I used charcoal on my first time and lost myself into it, just like my friend was doing with watercolors.

Meditating was amazing, and although I wanted to visually represent what I saw, I figured it was futile and I should just look at it all and enjoy it instead. I usually meditate a couple of times a week, but on acid the connection with the inside of oneself and the awareness of the outside is so much easier to feel and stronger. I felt instantly in deep sleep but completely aware of everything, in complete stillness, feeling the music through me and in the visuals. I sometimes have a lot of trouble with self-consciousnes and insecurity depending on what's going on with my life, and once again while tripping I realize that I don't need to ever feel that way.  I wanted my friend to meditate, but I realized she couldn't sit still. I think it was because of the roommate's parents being in the house, although they were in and out and obviously didn't care about whatever we were doing. She kept checking her phone, getting up, and doing all sorts of different things, and I just wanted her to look at the spheres of paper on her ceiling move to the music and have a life of their own.

We ate lots of fruit, laughed a whole lot and played lots of different music. Cars kept driving by constantly, and the light reflected off of them and into the bedroom, causing a beautiful, yellowish strobe light effect in the cool blue lighting in the room. I put my hands in the air and looked at them interact with the things above, far and below, in and out of focus. I closed them, waved them, moved them, and explored what it did to the image before my eyes. I quickly showered as a friend made her way over to hang with us and smoke a few bowls. It was hard to put my clothes back on. My skin felt really comfortable on its own, and clothing didn't make a lot of sense. My friend kept on painting.

I also played the guitar. All I could remember was ""the House of the Rising Sun,"" and I usually have trouble with the bass-picking and the F chord; but it all flowed perfectly from my hands when I played it then. It felt natural and I just played it without thinking. I plucked each of the chords after a moment of silence, to see what that would do to my vision. Turns out, not much. My friend kept asking why the songs ""weren't playing right"" out of her phone or her computer- I am pretty sure they were just fine, but they did sound really odd.

Ok, so as I am writing this story, I am still tripping a bit, so you will have to excuse any weirdness and strange grammatical phantoms that may appear from time to time. WooOooOo! 

I saw, tonight, one of the most savage acid burns I have ever seen. Ever.
(and I've been doing this shit for over 15 years). This was some brutal shit. Trust me.


Lets set the picture a bit. I recently made a friend who I sometimes make music with. Dylan (or whatever). I sometimes used to spend time at his place and jamming and just doing guy fun stuff. A new ""friend"" I guess. He seemed pretty cool. We like similar music. That's always good.;

So I live with my GF (who is fucking amazing, and the actual hero of this story), and she is just the best person (I'm not trying to ""big her up"", I just need you to understand how well loved she is and a bit of a local hero). Spends her life helping the community, genuinely, and massively respected by ""jail folk"" (who my GF helps, she's a lawyer / social worker / all around local hero). She's a fucking wonderful human being. She makes others feel good. She brings good into the world. 

 She's also not to be fucked with. Oh dear god no. 

Anyways my friend came around and we all decided to trip at ours (which brings me to my story finally):

While we're were tripping, he kept ""pushing"" for a reaction from my GF, purposefully challenging her to dominance in conversations, in her house as well, just being a bit of a self absorbed twat really. He is not someone who makes people feel nice, he always says mean things to bring you down. A negative person. He spat inside on two separate occasions (classy too), So yeah, while on acid, it becomes quite apparent that this guy is a total fucking cunt.  A massive 100% cock-up-his-own-arse wanker of the highest calliber. Doesnt understand the true meaning of LSD at all. Thinks he does which makes it even worse.  Ive been through some crazy times in my life, but i have never met a cunt like this. Trust me. A person who ""pecks"" at people to get a reaction (because you know, being mean to people is FUN right!? Especially in their house.). A very unpleasant man indeed. My GF and I are VETERANS at tripping and we see through people very easily. (dealing with jail folk will teach you that).

Imagine being around friends who bring warmth and love and positive vibes. This is how I see my friends and what I want to fill my life with.  This guys presence was dead. Pure ice. No love. No warmth. Not only that, but also quite a ""distain"" he carrys around because ""he is oh so enlightened because he understands the true meaning of acid and we simply ""havnt gotten it yet"". 

I mean surely you guys can already tell. What a fucking tool. 100% fail. 

But...It gets better.

Of course I was blissfully unaware of this silent and highly complex dominance mind game going on between my friend and my GF until my GF just casually smirked at him and said :

And this was were I almost wept of pride:

""You claim that you want to be our friend yet you have behaved  so incredibly offensive towards me and my home. You SPAT when I asked you a question earlier. You constantly peck at people who are feeling good to make them feel as sad as you feel inside. And im sorry if this puts a damperner on things, but I work with murderers and rapists who show me more respect than you do. You, sir, are what us civilized people have the misfortune of calling a ""cunt"". (the way she precisely and slowly mouthed out that word was almost as if she were making love to it). 

There was about 10 seconds of ""dead air"" as we call it in the business"". I was on the edge of my seat. Very Tense! He then started putting his shoes on and looked in my GFs eyes, literally with his tail between his legs. It was like seeing a child getting told off.  He then fucking asks my GF ""have I done anything to offend you?""

There were no words. The  look of venom I saw in my GFs eyes in that moment was truly Frightening. I've know her for 5 years, i have NEVER seen that look. This was some primal shit. 

She looked him dead in the eyes and very subtly flicked her head towards the front door. Not a word.

He raised his hands. Got his shoes and left quietly.

That shit was so incredibly and randomly arrousing I can't explain it. I dunno, to see a woman assert herself like that. In her state? With such tact? I fell in love with her all over again watching that little head flick she did. So fucking badass. 

She just chucked a scumbag out of my house with not so much as a subtle flick of her head. 

He may be wandering the streets right now without shoes on with a head full of acid and to be honest, I  don't really give a fuck. He is what we call a ""negative nancy"" and you don't want people like that around your loved ones.

So yeah, I don't really know why I told you this, but it was just kinda weird. My gf and i hugged and i said i had her back no matter what (even though it has became very apparent who wears the trousers) my GF is passed out now and I'm left writing you this feeling somewhat confused and weirdly arroused. 

You sure do learn a lot from people when you trip with them.

1305597611.0,21,self.LSD,hd133,I had a fairly introspective trip last night and am looking for some thoughts.,23,2,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/LSD/comments/hd133/i_had_a_fairly_introspective_trip_last_night_and/,"Hey guys,

Somewhere around midnight last night I decided to see how I could handle five hits of blotter (my previous best was three and personally I felt ready to take it further). I had previously taken acid about nine or ten times, but kept the dosage around one or two hits. I had the option to trip with some other people, but decided this time around to trip all by myself. This is something I had only done once before on one hit.

Anyway, I will cut to the chase. I set the mood with a documentary called ""Mystic India"" narrated by Peter O'Toole and had my iTunes loaded with a special playlist of different tunes from Alice Coltrane to Burial to Fatima Al Qadari. Within about thirty minutes of ingestion I started getting the beginning symptoms (slight anxiety, giddy demeanor) and soon enough I was way out there. 

What happened to me during this trip is very difficult for me to explain, which is something I'm sure a lot of you can understand. I forgot what I was for a while. Again, I didn't know what I was. Can you believe that? It was very bizarre. I talked to myself internally as if I were the creator of the universe. I saw time bend, it seemed like. I know that sounds insane, but I vividly remember seeing and rewinding the action of my hand petting my cat. I also saw faint traces of what could have been various religious imagery. Pictures of clouds seemed to have ""Satan"" written in them. A collection of markings on the wall resembled the sefirot. The skin on my arms seemed to develop transparent and shadowy tattoos that resembled branches of trees and I felt a strong sensation that some beings were embracing me from both sides of my body. I am not religious, so it was surprising to experience all of this.

When I didn't know what I was, I actually forgot my name and my desires, etc. It was incredibly strange. The theme of the trip soon turned into the idea that everything entire universe is the same thing. There is something in me that is in everybody, possibly every living thing. Though there was also a slight notion that we are much, much more insignificant than most people think. As if our universe were just a button on a million-button jacket in a giant overstocked warehouse. And, yeah, there were some mystical themes to my trip.

As soon as I started coming up, I vomited. As if releasing something inside of me. Man, I know this all sounds like strange stuff but I just need to express what I experienced to see if anybody else has gone through anything like this. Is this even something worth trying to make sense of?  The split seems to indicate to me that there are either some highly spiritual/higher-consciousness levels of life going on around us or that we are merely entirely alone in a group of multiverses that connect in ways we can't entirely understand, that somehow sustain each other. I guess the latter and former ideas somewhat connect, but I don't know.

Needless to say it was the most fucked up adventure of my life. EVERYTHING was rainbow colored and everything was breathing. I felt like I was going insane. It was awful at times and utterly blissful at others. Overall I don't think I will trip for a while (maybe like two months). It's one of those things where you have no idea what to expect. You feel really REALLY happy and you realize it hit you. Also, every effect is true: kaleidoscopic vision, breathing walls, rainbows (especially vivid in my case.

Acid Report
12:11AM- acid taken
1:03AM- currently laying on the tramp. Listening to D.A.N.C.E. by Justice. I'm feeling really good. Body not really functioning. 
1:45AM- in the thick of it now. Just found out John Doe took 3 tabs. He is convulsing on the trampoline. May need help
2:04AM- people drove all the way out here to come support me after I graduated high school. That's a pretty big deal. Life has changed forever. I won't have to see the same people everyday, but I get to make new friends and create new memories. I'm excited!
3:11AM- still tripping balls. Everyone is on separate journey, but we're still connected. Something about spiritual gateways.. I like the sound of the typing clicks. Click click click click click
3:25AM- this night is one for the ages. A journey embarked that's so epic, sober minds can never understand. It's like Christmas.
I can see from like 5 different points of view. It's interesting to be observing this happening while being immersed in it. Is this what hunter s Thompson felt like?
4:12AM- still tripping. Feels like its been forever but it hasn't. Sun rises in 1 or so hours
(That should be intriguing) where did Patrick Star go? Oh wait, he's in the shed.
Maggie May has some demons that need addressing. She has a lot of soul searching to do. She needs to realize that nobody hates her. We're just worried about her and want the best for her. 
Personal thought: I don't like talking on acid. I enjoy my inner monologue.

Bottom line: the only absolute I deal in is the absolute that nothing is absolute. 

I hear motorcycles racing

........
.........
............

4:35AM- it's only been like 30 mins but I can see a total difference. We're back in control

Or not... The grass is moving beautifully

4:43AM- this has been an eye opening experience for me. I've realized sooooo much about who I am and who I should be. If you don't have anything nice to say, don't say nothing at all 😃 
5:02AM- we are all the exact same. We're humans and we need to work together to survive.
Also, we all have our own dreams and visions of how the world should be.
We were convinced someone was missing the whole time

Patrick just kept talking about niggah shit. Huh?

5:24AM- we're no where near as tripped out as we were, but I'm still feeling it
5:28AM-I just want it to be over

5:38AM- ten mins until the sun rises!!! I'm so excited to see something beautiful!

Its a pretty semi-coherent ramble but at times felt very profound. I find LSD really inspiring. I'm glad I could bring something back with me from my trip. 

Here it is unedited, except for some spelling mistakes that I corrected:








""Yep can't formulate 1 solo idea to share 

seeing things wayyyy to clearly to be able to communicate what I'm thinking beyond it being something you have to feel and not anything that could be represented through words or descriptions. it would be a waste of time to even try to put this all together in a coherent manner in anyway. I don't even know if what im typing is being thought of or if what Im thinking is not a present state. there are no opinions. opinions of things are dumb. To have opinions is…. i'm over opinions. Uncertainty! UNFUCKINGCERTAINTY IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING. Im so certain of it! Its really not fair to think things other than what us currently presented to you at this very moment. Alex posted this crazy trippy thing of Facebook hop nope nope nile. Leaving this place and going to have an open mind about everything. Approach every new experience like I'm thinking right now. With fresh vibrant eyes. you really need to have a lot of time on your hands to be able to just stop and think don't you? hope its not too late for me. I know its not. only getting older but need to take your time. speed dial rotator. if you look really close at anything it instantly becomes very interesting and creative. Same goes for if you zoom out and look at systems and how they work. things that are bigger than you. which is pretty much everything. The temporary nature of this tripped out amazing daydream colourful feeling state and mindset I'm in, hopefully nonsensical and unfiltered. So many times you don't say what you want or need because its just hard to manipulate it into words flow feelings flow out words don't. its about trying to put those feelings into a more communicable form. and spell-able. not very spell-able right now. or ever. its probably better to not spend any time trying to edit anything a lot of the times. Then also woaaah, i think society wants you to edit things. edit your life

over think it and edit it. every decision you make is a very specific EDIT to what you want people to think of you. but the most important things are the things you feel. Love is what it is i guess. that thing everyone can't stop thinking about for some reason. its something you need to feel and sometimes that doesn't translate well into circumstances and really getting to know people properly. its a real shame things are so superficial almost all the time. i don't feel like i could speak these ideas out of my head. they probably just wouldn't come out right. goes from daylight to total nighttime darkness soo fast. I feel like i need to stare in someones eyes for a few minutes sometimes. really a thing you only do with people you love. probably have only stared a few people in the eyes in my entire life. All people that i love i guess. LOVE not Love'd love is a kind of crazy thing that doesn't have a past tense really. it shouldn't if your doing something right maybe. why are things so hard sometimes and why do i waste time thinking about anything. we all just over think everything. it hilarious. our world is just made up of 7 billion people who over think everything and we don't even realize how good we have it because we spend so much time focusing on what is annoying even though there are a lot of things that are annoying. Such a free flow of ideas unlike anything. you just have to catch as many short insights as you can. its tough to decide whether you should try to bring these back with you or just try to soak it in in hopes that the feeling stays with you forever and it can become your outlook on your whole life. Im getting very anxious that this text file isn't saved.

thats the word. buzzing in your ear to live up to responsibilities and fulfill obligations. k gonna save. As if i spend so much fucking time looking into a fucking metal box of electricity. its fucking absurd. i've probably lost half my life to this metal box. but its also done sooooo many good things for me that its almost worth it. maybe it is. i think I'm typing the words before i even actually process them right now

 I'm always 2 words ahead it seems like. Fuck spelling things right. We need to leave that behind if we want to seek a better future. Basically you need to submit to commerce or you will be outcast from society. I think i can almost definitely say i have no real attachment to material items. I have done without and I have done with and i don't think i need them. Comfort is a different story. Think I'm ready to give that up for a while. I think you can live in the moment more if you do. Hahahahahah just thought about my student loans. oh wait thats just an imaginary number that means nothing oh yeah forgot about that. It is absurd. in this state I can't think of any way in which anybody could intentionally harm another person for any reason. WHY DOES our society operate of the backs of exploited people. the exploited majority. its truly impossible to properly communicate any of these ideas in words. its almost like you just have to look into someones eyes and think about it and maybe that feeling will transfer to them. feeling. feeling. and short term if you just un-filter freeform expression. that's how you can get pure ideas. GO EDIT THIS LATER. fuck it for now

I'll just spew out whatever i can possibly get out now even if its illegible who cares. The words are starting to form funny structures and patterns. The shapes of the paragraphs have a personality to them. If you zoom out and look at it I think thats what good creativity is. expressing an idea where the ego is taken out of an experience. Or in the opposite to were its very very involved superficial and not timeless and can be beautiful  with shitty imperfections. its truly the thing that makes life worth living to its fullest. to seek out as many new experiences and imperfections and details and narrow-minded half opinions that you thought you once had. imagine a language where past or future tense didn't exist? its would be a positive world if that language was put into use. Everything EVERYTHING. at the exact same time. over and over again. repetitive and mantra-istic octaves zooming out geometric shapes and imperfections. these thoughts are just orbiting my head. without any control. Oh man i can't even imagine talking to someone that is strightminded right now. would definitely think I'm crazy. we are told that what is truly sane is crazy. I don't know if i should share this with people or not. i feel like i should but i don't know. who cares what people think. you just have to do whatever. it really takes strong people to be really honest.I really appreciate honesty in people. more than anything right now really. Ha i think Devin is talking to his mom on the phone right now. wonder if thats going weird for him or not. LSD is unbelievably inspiring and thought provoking like nothing else in this entire man made bucket of dirt we live in. Just looking at which words got randomly capitalized in this text document really speaks a lot



even tho it probably shouldn't. are those my most important thoughts maybe? I GUESS. Yeah all the capitalized words seem important. its pretty subconscious i guess. theres a lot going on in the background that we have actually no understanding of. Its crazy how fragile things are. like the tiniest bit of water could destroy this computer. the elements

are what we SHOUD FEAR. THE ELEMENTS. THERE ITS CAPiTOLIZED. Noone ever really says my name very often, i wish people did more, i don't know why. there's something really nice about when someone gets your attention by gently saying your name. it doesn't happen often for some reason. UNCERTAINTY. EXACT UNCERTAINTY. You need to exact your uncertainty on the world. WOAH that is really really fucking awesome. i guess i swear a lot. is that bad? why am i questioning myself? WHO CARES? This is how YOU communicate. I need to not get in a habit of putting a laptop on my crotch. thats really dumb, its going to microwave my balls and give me cancer. like Duncan. That guy has taught me a lot in podcast form. Has really had an indoctrination effect on me. but in a good way. to be indoctrinated in good ideas is good. Is it? indoctrinarian is not ever good is it. its almost like we have to use this dirty tricks against the system and use them for good. Its crazy how there is always a THEY. THEY. 



IT TAKES TALKING TO YOUR HWHOLE FAMILY ON SPEAKERPHONE TO REALIZE your still fucked add can't coordinate these words into a sentence thats half good. I just want someone to love me before i die i guess. thats about it, fucking sappy right???? left up down. Cant tell if I've written a lot or not. 30 SPF mind lulling trip. totally unrelated and egotistical of me but I'm in the best shape of my life right now. finally some of this effort is feeling like its paying off. when you make healthy choices they stay with you for life i think.I have muscles for once in my life.

I took a molly last Friday and rolled for my first time ever and during the next few days while coming down and being depressed I realized that college changed me so much. In high school I was really introspective and always thought about things because I was always in search of knowledge, while in college all I wanted to do was get fucked up and I was losing my introspective and thoughtful self that so many people knew me for. When I realized this I began to think more and more, questioning why it was so, I was just so confused about myself and my life. I eventually came to the conclusion that I should try acid because I heard that it gave you a new perspective on life. I asked a really close friend to take it with me and ended up taking it with her and another girl. I was so nervous from thinking about having a bad trip, but I couldn't let my friends see it because I knew it would freak them out. I tried my best to stay mentally strong and dug deep and knew everything would be fine. I had such an introspective trip with mild visuals that, although I didn't completely figure everything out, it still really helped me with figuring some of myself out. I woke up this morning knowing my body was exhausted but still felt amazing, I felt a lot more at peace with myself.

He is someone that I honestly trust with my life and he has eaten it so many times before that I knew I was in good hands. The first time I had bought acid it was bunk, and I didn't really trip at all, slight visuals, but I wanted to eat acid for the mental aspect, to expand my mind, thought, and try to grasp the world. Luckily I decided to ride with him to get some bud. He ran back to car and said he could get lucy. An hour later we're back in the car and grab it. To make a longer story short, we ate the acid at around 12:30 AM, the rise was great, I was in the most peaceful mindset I had ever been in. I was with my best friend and we were sharing this great moment and there's nothing in the world that could have topped it. It waved in and out, as soon as the feeling started fading away I wanted it back so bad. But i remember laying on the couch and my room mate was talking to me and I was inside this ""bubble"" for lack of better words, and his conversation was it's own entity. I could feel his entity, his conversation protruding it's way into my life, my aura, my ""bubble"". I was letting him into my life, my mind, and he was doing the same for me. I came to, and started talking to my room mate describing the beauty of the situation as I'm sure most of you lsd veterans know of. The second time it came around I was clenched in the fetal position on the couch, and I was standing on the edge of a cliff. A river ran from my feet all the way to the mountainous horizon, halfway to the horizon another mountain had intersected the river where a waterfall was flowing into the river itself, it was beautiful, I was looking at everything I wanted, or needed in life, I came to and started crying because of the glory of the situation. The third time it hit me, I was caught in this white light, standing on the mystical ""platform"" once again for a lack of better words, and the sun was setting below me. It was almost as if I was standing on a bridge of time watching this new chapter in my life start.  Witnessing the mentality of my old, closed off self finally meet its resting place so I could move on and start with a clean slate. Came too and cried once again.

For settings sake, it was November 17th, 2012, around 1:30 PM on a bright, sunny Saturday. Earlier that morning at exactly 8:21, I had dropped two tabs of LSD with Taylor on the bus to New York City. It all seemed like a dream, really.

I was surrounded by vibrant orange, red, and green leaves that were on giant oaks that draped along the rim of the path; all filled with squirrels and birds, fat from getting ready to hibernate for the winter. There was a lily pond surrounded by a large, towering boulder. While walking down to the benches, we all passed squirrels that climbed the fence and looked curiously at us, as I looked just as curiously back to them, because of my current state. We reached the benches and I proceeded to pull out the blunt I had rolled earlier that morning. I casually lit it up as a few people passed. Strangely, they didn’t seem too bothered by the smell of it like I had assumed. As I took my first drag, the weed affected me immediately and intensified nearly everything. The leaves exploded with more color than I could have imagined, and the water reflected the shade of green from the foliage around the base of it. Taylor and I were just astonished by the peacefulness of it all. Never have I experienced that much serenity. I was pretty much content just doing that the whole day; it was so beautiful. Then, there was a family of three who came down to where we were. The father was very well dressed in a suit and tie, his daughter, in an expensive-looking dress, and mother in a pair of jeans with a suit jacket over. 

First, I saw the father and his daughter come running down the hill, her giggling, him smiling and looking happy to be there. The mother stood back filming the moment happen. Then, the daughter stopped in front of a bench where a squirrel was looking for nuts. The father then said, “Do squirrels wear mittens?” “No!” giggled the daughter. He then asked the same question about birds; more laughter ensued by all three of them this time. She then passed us, galloping, which we all thought was adorable beyond belief. She then stopped up ahead to the other hill, looking at another creature in the piles of leaves on the ground. She then resumed her galloping, and the father said in a funny way, “Okay, lets gallop, yeah, okay!” 

The whole time, I was just teary eyed. I just watched something incredible and touching, and just don’t think that the words above don’t even capture what I’m trying to say. All I had for an expression was just a big smile and water lining my eyes. I was taken aback by the happiness of the situation, the fact that it just seemed so perfect and sweet. It made me realize that I want to be happy and loving when I grow up, and I want a family like that. I want to be a happy father and a good husband with a happy family who lives in a decent city with a great life. I want to have something like that.

It was 10 am and I was driving to my friends house when I dropped 3 microdots under my tongue. When I got there, I went into the entertainment room where my friend was. His dad was in the garage and came in to say hello. They were going to leave in 30 minutes. He jokingly told me to make sure him and his girlfriend don't do anything and to keep an eye on them when she got there. When she got there 10 mins later, I was starting to get a good body high. I looked in the mirror and saw my pupils getting very big. My friend's parents finally left and I was getting good ripple effects. The entertainment room was very dark which made it perfect. My friend took his girlfriend to the other room where they did there business and left me to trip alone. I had the lights dim in the room and just played pink Floyd the dark side of the moon off my phone while I walked around in a circle. I started getting colorful visuals. I think I was actually seeing the music because the colors were different based on the music. Sometimes it would be a purple haze look glazed over my field of vision. Sometimes red or yellow too. The colors made me very euphoric and I started laughing uncontrollably that I was actually seeing music. I was also thinking of my friends reaction if he saw me circling the room laughing. It was a funny at the time. After a few tracks, I went outside on the porch to enjoy the outdoors. When I opened the door to go outside, it felt like something out of a movie. It was a bright beautiful day and it had just rained the day before. I wish I could describe the feeling of walking out the door better but it was purely euphoric. As I sat on the porch with the music still playing. I was just looking at the wooden porch. It was warping and looked like a sea. Below the deck was a gravel drive way and each rock looked like mountains. As I sat their listening to pink floyd, I had a crazy thought. That life is exactly like an acid trip! You really have to just make the best of your situation. Acid trips are long, and so is life. We get to experience so much before we die, sometimes good, sometimes bad. There I was peaking and enjoying every second of it. My friend finally finished and his girlfriend drove us in my car around town. When we got back, we watched a movie which I didn't understand then went on a walk. I had a good walk and was coming down a lot.

I am a writer who dabbles a little in philosophy, and I am looking to experience my first true psychedelic trip. I think my mind is right for it.  

Drugs I’ve tried: cannabis, codeine, hydrocodone, and Adderall. I  did have one negative experience with cannabis. It caused me to once have a brief “flash” of panic that I was able to talk myself out of. For a few days thereafter I suffered from increased anxiety—more the result of me going “I have never had this experience, why me?” and fearing it would happen again—which I rationalized into oblivion after about a week. I eased myself back into cannabis and now have no trouble with it, or Adderall or caffeine for that matter.  

I had sufficiently built up my confidence until I read of the 16 year old girl who suffered a meltdown while on the drug (http://www.reddit.com/r/LSD/comments/19y59f/hey_guys_i_really_need_advice_on_legal_troubles/). I have also heard of negative trips, thoughts of suicide, etc. I generally consider myself a rational person who doesn’t scare easily, and I have never been suicidal, but then again LSD is said to be one of the most powerful substances known.  I guess I just want to give it its true respect, and start with half a tab on my day off. I think I know all of the ground rules: don’t trip in the dark, don’t trip alone, have good music available, etc. But should I go so far as to remove my firearms (I live in the Midwest USA) from my residence as well? Any chance of me mistaking a gun for a lollipop? Would having my partner take me to the park be a good idea? How well will I know my surroundings? Will I still recognize my neighborhood as such, and not a four dimensional version of Mars?    

That said, I will have a hydroxyzine available should things get too intense. From my reading, I think the best mindset for a trip comes by way of analogy. Like a rollercoaster, it will probably be wild, at times scary, and at times fun, but relatively harmless.

This is my LSD story.,21,3,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/LSD/comments/132dzn/hello_rlsd_this_is_my_lsd_story/,"I was thinking how to make this as short as possible, so lets start. I am 25 year old male from medium town in center of Europe. I have been using LSD for 5.5-6 years now, and have probably consumed 50+ acids.

The whole thing that got me here was [This.](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/130xkt/2_frightening_drawings_that_my_friend_did_on_an/c6zu0hv)
I can now see that my way of taking acid is ofc not the *only way*.

To make long story short, i will describe my first 2 times that i took acid. First one was bad. I had no experience, same as 2 of my friends that were with me. It ended up with 1 of them leaving home in a peak of trip, and when his parents saw him he almost ended up in hospital because he was really out of control (scared!). We were in town. It was dark. We was scared and not ready for a really strong trip we took. 2nd friend also went home 2hrs later and left me alone in the middle of the town. I menaged to get home safe and without any problems, but because of what happend with the whole trip and 2 of my friends i could not relax even when i got home, and I live alone. The paranoia just overwhelmed all of us. It felt really bad,like we did something really wrong. I was feeling guilty for providing acid to my friends. I turned on ALL the light in house, and to be really honest, coulden't find anything good in this trip at that point. Everything in house was scary, I got a feeling I was being watched and the 3 walks i took in the middle of the night diden't help also. I still dont know why I took these walks, when it was really clear I am not stable enough to focus and enjoy my trip. It was more like my trip was enjoying *me.* To conclude-nobody died, got injured or whatever. None of my 2 friends took LSD ever again. Me, on the other hand...

So here goes trip no. 2.

I re-connected with my old friend that was out of town for a long time. When he got back in town, we became best friends ever. Naturally, after some time I told him this complete story about my first acid, and what do you know.. He was already tripping for 2 years regularly at that point. By himslef. In the mountains. Its clear that, at this point, i felt really good when i was with him, as he really is good, understanding honest man. He was not pushing me into it at all - it was my idea because all the time I felt there is much more in acid that i got to know. So one day, we packed our bags, took 3 acids (1.5 each) and went deep into the mountains. We had complete weekend fee. We took some sandwiches, chocolate, bunch of natural juices, some weed and went into the mountain/woods early in the morning. I was feeling so safe, so good with him. I had a feeling that, whatever happens he will be there for me to help me. When acid kicked in, I was so overwhlemed by happines and joy, I just still cant describe it. Man, that was something.. At first i felt somekind of energy going trough my body starting from my shoulders. the sun was shining trough woods, I took my shirt off and just layed there in my shorts on the grass and i felt like I FINNALY understand ""how it all works"". I had some visual distorsions, but in a really really good way. We were also pretty sure there was a little forest dwarf that was following us, and guarding us from bad forces. I never felt beter in my life. Never. Suddenly, complete world made so much sense. All the trees, flowers and the sun.. I felt soo good just being there with them, and I was huggin EVERYTHING. When I closed my eyes it was almost like i could ""see"" all the positive energy around me. We were just flowing like a river trough this trip and we dident even talked much-words were obsolete, just a look was enough to tell "" Damn man, I dont want this to stop,ever!"" Everything made sense you know? Like, every tree, every little grass like its exactly where its supposed to be, and like im a crucial part of it all. When we went off the mountain, we crashed at my place listening to some Hendrix and smoking loads of weed. I never,ever, felt better in my life.

We are still tripping to this day, mostly on the same mountain, but we went some other places too. I never, ever, had a bad trip since then. Thats was almost 6 years ago. To this day, he is still my best friend and my best LSD companion. It changed me so much, its for a completely different topic. I look at things different, i respect things and people so much more now. It really opens your eyes, in a way that i thought was impossible.

So what exactly is the point of this story? Well its rather simple-I really think when you are stepping in a world of acid, you need a good friend, some nature and some free mind. You gotta be open to it, accept it and not be scared of it-it may be rather difficult if you are with wrong people, wrong environment and wrong approach.

**TL;DR:** My first trip was really bad, but with right friend and right environment it can be a life changing thing, and in a really positive way. Not all people are the same, some may feel a different situation is perfect for them.. But i found that nature in all of its glory will give you the best trip of all times.

I read quite a bit on bluelight about it and tried out doing a low dose of LSD (about a half of one of what I have experienced as decent but nothing spectacular tabs) for an electro show during the day at the beach. I had a really great time.

This is not about upvotes, this is a question that I have. So I did acid for the 4th time last night. I haven't taken it for about 8 months and I had lost the ability to realize the cycles that it puts you through. I had gone quite far down the rabbit hole with three friends of mine, one who took the same amount as me (three hits), and two others who were making sure we had some sort of anchor to reality. However, the anchors had left for about 30 mins right before the peak, and it was just my friend and I left to our own devices. I had lost all since of time, memory, and reality, forgetting how I got to this state of flying through the universe, when our anchors got back. In time, when we all sat on the bed and began the downfall of post visuals and pre realizations, I was certain that I was dying, dead, or trapped in my own head, and the people that I were having conversations with were merely my interpretation of my guides that were helping me transition into the afterlife. Then, in one profound moment, in the state of my intense confusion, when I realized that I may very well be dead, I came to terms with it. I faced death, let it all go, all of my worries and doubts, and told myself that whatever happens now will be the start of a new life. That realization literally gave me a clean slate, the freshest start that I had ever had. To me there is a beauty in facing death head on, and litterally starting over, starting fresh, and knowing that however lost that I was, I would just roll with it all and see where the waves take me. Figured I would share that with you all, and please comment to give me some of your insight if you ever faced death and just came to terms with it, said ""fuck it"", and rolled with it.

(long but worth it),21,3,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/LSD/comments/rfcdp/serious_acid_trip_long_but_worth_it/,"Ok iv been meaning to write up a trip report for a while and its coming up to a year since this happened, the funny thing is its only now that i fully understand what happened through discussions with the people i was with and reading a lot of trip reports. apologies now for the length but i want you to know every detail.

Ok basically, me and 4 of my very close friends went on a week holiday to the north of scotland to stay in a cottage there. It was the perfect location as we all felt comfortable there and it was remote away from the rest of civilisation. We arrived and on the first day were so excited about the week ahead that we really kicked the ass out of ourself the first night with a lot of other drugs, Mandy, K, Mcat... you name it. THIS WAS A BAD IDEA!

We woke up the next day feeling like death and decided to drop acid as soon as we woke so we had the whole day to trip. We had two tabs each, but one was double strength so we basically triple dropped. I had taken acid once before and loved it but it wasn't as strong as i had hoped so this is why we took so much (aprox 300ug) About 20 mins into dropping one of my friends had an accident with a three man sling shot and fucked up his arm really badly... this was HIS first time dropping! this really fucked us all up and my other friend felt very ill because of it. Once we established that his arm was actually alright we left him and my friend who was sick in the cottage to chill whilst me and the 2 others went for a walk. It was when we went on this walk that shit started getting real. We sat down by a small river and watched it, the wall oposit us had suffered from erosion due to the river and was a very strange texture. To me it was basically a geometric wall that had many shapes and faces in it. We then walked to a old cottage ruin and it felt like an absolute treck filled with laughter and falling over (the reality was this ruin was seriously abut a 2 min walk) We were there for a while when suddenly we saw are other 2 friends walking towards us. At this point we all felt an overwhelming sense of belonging and a serious group mentality, like we were being reunited for the first time in years. It was awesome! 

We then walked back to the cottage discussing how crazy it was getting and what had happened in our own minds so far. Once we were there we sat on the grass laughing for a while until i asked what time it was, at this point i was expecting to have been tripping for a good 5 hours or so.. WRONG! it had only been an hour. At this point we all went crazy and started running around. We eventually met up again in the cottage living room where we sat and talked for a while about different concepts  we were thinking. Someone reminded us that we were on a drug. This was a strange reminder that what we experiencing wasn't ""reality"" because we has become so accustomed to things being the way they are when your on acid that it just felt normal now. We then discussed why we do drugs as we were all feeling shit from the night before and were started to feel a bit scummy.. this was resolved when someone said ""We do it because we like it"" This put us all back in a good mood and we all went off in groups on separate walks again.

This is where shit started to get really intense. Me and one of my friends went on a long walk up the road from the cottage. It was at this point that we felt like we had known each other for decades and that what was happening was meant to be and almost dejavu like. Once we reached to top of the road we were faced with a massive field that had a huge mountain at the end of it. The sun was behind this mountain and the colours on the field were just beautiful. It was here that i peaked!

I watched the world end and recreate itself in front of me with my friend. The feelings were inexplicable and what i saw was also. I still struggle to put it into words even after a year of discussion but basically i felt like the universe had started a new cycle and i was reliving history again and again and again. I then went into a crazy loop where i would just wander the cottage and the fields around it repeating the words MIND and TIME. These two words had an inexplicable meaning to me and i felt like i had to remember them  to  stay alive (not in a bad way) in a very positive way. 

The next few hours are just a blur and i don't really know what happened. It got to the stage were i was totally in control of the drug and its effects. I could literally pick up an object and morph it into anything i wanted to a certain degree. This was awesome and i spent a lot of time playing with it. I experienced a lot of different visuals round about this time as well. A few of my friends had vines growing up there faces, the fields we were walking through burst into flames at certain points, if i stared at my hands it was like they were decomposing and rotting away until it was just dead skin on bone, Then once i blinked they were back to normal. Again this sounds horrible but i had become so used to it that it didn't scare me anymore. I WAS FUCKING LOVING IT! 

The trip ended after about 14 hours and i peaked for about 4 or 5 of this. It was seriously the best day of my life and although this post is insanely long i have still missed out sooooo much. I experienced many common things such as surfaces breathing etc, but i felt the stuff i wanted to talk about was quite personal to me. I also experienced serious ego death during the peak and round about this time i also got the fear.

However, if there is one thing i have learned from this trip it is that any hallucinogen will have a bad side (THE FEAR!) but you've got to learn to enjoy it and deal with it. Its part of the experience and i wouldn't want it to be another way! I seriously love LSD and think everyone should try it at some point in there life as it is so unique and can't be explained, no matter how hard i try, only experienced! Make sure you are with people you know, in a location you know and feel comfortable with, and We didn't have one, but i would recommend a sitter as this helps a lot.",,False,,t5_2qhvj,False,,,True,t3_rfcdp,http://www.reddit.com/r/LSD/comments/rfcdp/serious_acid_trip_long_but_worth_it/,

I enjoyed my trip immensely. I took about 6 hits over the whole day, 3 to get off and 3 spread out to do what i imagined would prolong the visuals. I've done shrooms plenty of times so i sort of knew what to expect. I went for a walk with my wife and realized that for the first time in about 7-8 years i was not experiencing my spine or knee pain. Little back ground, i have some severe spinal injuries, as well as fucked up post-op knees and ankles, from heavy construction/demolition work in my late teens/twentys.  Anywho, I realized during my walk that the Lucy had taken away my pain COMPLETELY, and i felt as if i could walk forever! This caused some really intense crying out of joy, since, 2 years ago i sat with a gun in my mouth, ready to go out due to the pain just totally engulfing my thoughts, and being put on some shitty antidepressant for the pain  (soon after this i was offered shrooms, which helped me get out of my depression and realize my pain would just have to be managed somehow). I've since tripped 2 other times, with similar doses, each 7 days apart. my SO has been my sitter, and enjoys my new found ability to do things i havent been able to in years (we're planning a hike!) but she also worries that i may be ""putting it on a pedestal"" or getting too into it, because i tripped 3 weeks in a row, and as you can imagine i have been trying to process the experiences by talking it out. I feel that this frequency isnt that bad, seeing as how i just discovered it, and the effect it has had on my pain, and outlook on life. Is 3 times in 3 weeks too much? I'm willing to take a break but at the same time i feel unable to do some of the awesome things ive been able to do while tripping, like attending an all day boardwalk show that was basically a 5-6 mile walk outdoors. Also since tripping i feel that i no longer want to be on opiates. I fear for my liver and for my brain. I've prescribed hyrdocodone ES for over a year, around 4-5 a day but after tripping have cut my usage EXPONENTIALLY, and i would like to get to a point where i dont need it at all.

For as long as i can remember I have always thought of myself as agnostic. Not just because it was a comforting thought but also because it meant I could kind of choose what to believe all on my own. However, I have also always known deep down that what i thought about religion and life wasn't really true. Somewhere in my mind the harsh reality of life lurked but i refused to acknowledge it. This reality was empty and terrifiyng, the thought of my mind going completely blank, not ""existing"" anymore seriously scared the shit out of me. So I supressed it, refusing to even consider it as an option of what would happen after I'm gone.

But now something has made me realize that I can't hide from the truth anymore.
I recently droppped acid for the first time and it was a life changing experience unlike any other. It was going fine throughout the build up and peak and I was feeling great for some time after the peak as well. During this time I had made ridiculous statements about life and such all the time and felt like I had everything figured out as pink floyd's ""time"" roared through the halls. But alas, there was something I hadn't figured out yet, the meaning of life itself.

That was when it hit me, it hit me so hard that it nearly knocked me over. The vast emptiness of space and time and how we are just energy, circulating around each other and everything else that exists in this world. wich would mean that when we are done on earth our minds go blank and we will just be energy constantly moving through space. Even if this sounds nice, it's not something we will experience anyway because our brains doesn't function anymore.

This is of course just speculations evn though everything isn't just taken from nowhere. I think one [video!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIJHJzDQcRM&amp;feature=share) that I recently saw had the biggest influence for this ""theory"".
This is what I believe is to happen after we die, well atleast the part where the brain goes blank. That's really the one thing that i believe like 99% right now. So what I wanted to hear from you guys was if anyone has had a similar experience or come to the same conclusion and how you have coped with the knowledge of ""knowing"", that there's nothing after this life.

I'm hoping for an interesting and mostly serious discussion. Have a nice day!

I've tripped on Lucy 4 times and every time I came to this conclusion. Allow me to explain. 

When we go on a trip, our immediate surroundings and environment can affect that trip. For example, when I trip in nature, I personally feel harmony and beautify, and a massive connection yo the Earth and universal consciousness. 

When I trip indoors, I still feel a connection to a universal consciousness but the trip takes on a much more linear, logical thought approach. I arrive to similar conclusions about everything, but I arrive at them in a more logical, ordered manner. 

When I trip at a concert, I again arrive to the same conclusions, but through a feeling of musical spirit and connectedness through musical melodies. 

So, this may be a roundabout way of arriving to a conclusion, but I think setting up an environment in such a way to cultivate the mind of the person/people tripping can be an art form. An art form related to psychology, color, vibes, the universal consciousness, etc.

Is this a good time for LSD?",25,8,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/LSD/comments/15yfz6/just_started_to_fix_some_issues_in_my_life_i_feel/,"So I've been excited about taking LSD for a few years now. Ever since I read about this experiment a few years ago: http://boingboing.net/2012/08/03/in-mid-60s-lsd-research-stud.html

Last summer I took what I think to be a weak / small dose, that caused be to laugh uncontrollably at times.

Just to give a little context of my life:

I've smoked weed, mostly joins mixed with tobacco, and got addicted to that mix (I am not a cigarette smoker) to the point where the highlight of my day was about getting home rolling a joint. That turned out to be a problem for obvious reasons, but also because it seemed to have stripped everything I liked about myself: being enthusiastic, analytical, curious. I like my incessant drive to improve myself. 
Smoking those joints every day stripped all of those. I kept thinking about the smoking, and also had anxious thoughts about being addicted to them, about not having all those qualities anymore, about being apathetic, about being bored and not wanting to do anything all day. 

This anxiety was compounded by my health issues. Sometimes it was paralyzing anxiety. Not quite panic attack, but quite close. It was contant and pressing and the worse was that I blamed myself.

About my health, I have some digestive issues. Cramps, and Reflux mainly. Tobacco-Weed seemed to help, so each time I tried to get off it, I got my digestive cramps back and that, together with the tobacco withdrawal symptoms, kept making me relapse.

So recently, (mid nov) I firmly decided to quit joints, tobacco, and to try stay off weed (most of my friends smoke, so I decided to make conscious decisions about if I should smoke it, not just give into peer pressure, or to my impulses. And to smoke it rarely). I have smoked weed 3 times since then (pipe), and each time I didn't enjoy the fact that I couldn't quite focus when I was stoned. It reminded my of the anxiety.

Also, to deal with my anxiety, I've started examining it in more detail. I concluded that part of the cause of were my health problems, part lack of growth. I've started reading again, exercising. I began meditating, and reading a lot about this.

I feel better, calmer, more in control. I still have issues, but I'm more mindful about them. I still have a long road ahead, and the realisation that I need to pace myself has helped. 

Anyway, today, a friend of mine told me that he can score some LSD. So the opportunity to try it has arrived. So I started researching how I could plan my first proper trip. I thought of searching how LSD blends with meditation practice. 

The first discouraging read I found was this: http://www.messagefrommasters.com/Therapy/LSD-an-Help-in-Meditation.htm

The second is this: http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/kbm70/has_anyone_had_lsd_induced_problems/

I feel kinda fragile now, so I'm wondering if I should try it now, if it could be beneficial to the point I understand meditation and myself better, or if another way to fuck myself up. I don't feel everything is resolved in my life, I feel like I have a rough plan, and am trying gain control of it. Still trying to deal with some work issues (which are related to the rest).

Have you had similar experiences? Should I try LSD now?
What about if I started meditation? What do you think?

**TL;DR: Have had anxiety problems triggered by observing the apathetic mental state I had when addicted with Tobacco-Weed joints, compunded by stress from health issues. Started to put my life in order with *meditation*, exercise, reading.

The first time I took Acid, I was 17, I purchased it from a wonderful man who was at the festival, and he was literally the A-Z of drugs! He had it in a dropper bottle, and dropped it fresh onto tabs for us. 

I took it, and went off to enjoy the rest of the day/evening. Found myself very nervous on the come up, but once it had peaked, it was amazing and I spent the night enjoying the crazy thoughts and visuals, and mostly sitting on a hill, looking down on the festival, I then decided to head back to the tents with my friends, we happened to have some nitrous with us and we all did a balloon each when we got back,

What happened afterwards was the single most mind bending/ amazing experience I've ever had!

 As I kept inhaling the balloon, I could see what I can only describe as a giant ""Hit the thing with the hammer,  and see if you can make it ring the bell at the top"" fairground type things.. But rather than hitting anything, the piece of wood, or whatever it is that hits the bell, got  higher the more I inhaled and exhaled into the balloon.. and I suddenly had the wonderful/awful realization that If it got to the top, and the bell rang, then ""something"" would happen, me being the adventurous type, I stayed with it, and rode it to the top.

 I never actually remember hearing the bell ring, but I remember feeling suddenly like I was in motion, and as i opened my eyes, i was actually shooting upwards away from the campsite, and I could see myself lay on my back with my feet sticking out the tent, as well as my group of friends also sat around the campsite, I then realised that I could either choose to go back down, or shoot on up the way and see where I was going.. but either myself, or another entity, I'm still unsure.. Told me that if I went up the way, then There would be no coming back.. I didn't really know what to do and was pretty damn scared, so I shut my eyes.. and within what felt like seconds i was opening them again, finding myself back in the tent, deflated balloon in  hand! I spoke to my friends about it, and they, although they were all busy doing their own balloons, hadn't taken Acid, so they had finished their balloons much sooner than I had, and I at some point apparently just fell onto my back in my tent, and they presumed I was tripping hard! Now I also think this, but I often wonder if it was something a bit more than just a trip..

 I have since experienced Out of Body Experiences while being completely sober, after just waking up or whatever, and the similarities between that experience, and the feeling of an out of body experience scare me sometimes.. I often wonder if in fact, that exact combination of chemicals in my brain at the time, opened me up to that sort of an experience in sober life? And whether or not the experience I had, might have actually been a point in my life where I could have died.. but I somehow made it back? 

Just wondering if anyone here has any thoughts on this? Or similar experiences? Sorry for the wall of text :) 

Another note: The whole time, before and after taking the tab, I smoked a fair amount of Cannabis!

TL:DR

Went to a festival, got high, took acid, did nitrous, had crazy out of body/ near death experience,  that ended up being extremely similar to later OBE experiences in sober life!

So, I was with my girlfriend, and both of us took one hit of acid at about midnight, not really expecting such an intense and crazy trip. For the first couple of hours after taking it, things went pretty smoothly, we sat and listened to music and kept one another up to date on how we were feeling.
At about 3 hours in, eeevverything starts melting and morphing. Colors exploded from every corner, and with closed eyes, I saw insane brightly colored spiraling geometric fractals that looked to be a thousand miles across. Her room resembled a living, breathing, dormant biomass that was constantly changing from a geometric plane to a very organic and psychedelic space.
Heres where things get interesting. We lay next to eachother, with our heads practically touching, and I felt an extremely strong sense of my girlfriends mental prescence, and could tell that something was about to happen. I got the urge out of no where, and decided to tell her 'telepathy is real' . She looks at me sort of oddly, smiles, and puts her head back down. I dont exactly know what the first things we communicated were, but I remember knowing exactly what she was thinking without talking to her, and I could clearly communicate messages to her by melding my conscience with hers, per say.
After a while of basking in disbelief and attempting to get our minds to realize that what happened was indeed real, she decided to attempt to convey a message to me. This is how I am 100% sure her and I telepathically communicated: She put her head up against mine, and we closed our eyes. I clearly heard her repeat 'I love you' in her head over and over. I backed away, looked her in the eye, and told her I love her too. She was almost completely astonished and bewildered at my ability to read her mental message. We continued to do this back and forth for roughly 4 hours, each message being more complex and unbelievable than the last.. Although I cannot quite remember many of the other ways we tested out our new.. 'ability' for lack of a better term. It was a beautiful experience to say the least, I never ever would have thought something like that would be possible. Its simply incredible.
It was her first time ever doing a psychedelic, so I basically (with the help of LSD) opened up her mind to an immense amount of new possibilities, and potential. Our reality as we knew it has been changed completely as we defied the laws we thought were restricting us. To break those chains and have an insanely spiritual journey in such a little amount of time is beyond belief. 
Never doubt the human mind, it is indeed more complex than you could ever imagine. If you're close with someone and you are tripping, tell them telepathy is real, and then try out for yourself. The third eye is easily opened with a little concentration, possibly some drugs, and someone you care about.

Sorry if the report itself is long, I'll try to keep it short and I'll add a tl;dr as well..


So my friends and I have planned to drop acid all together for a while now, so for this years Canada Day, July 1st, for you non Canadians, we decided to venture out into a big forest/creek in our area. I personally dropped 3 tabs, while my other friends dropped 1 or 2. We dropped on the way to the forest, so as soon as we got off the trails into the actual forest, we were already feeling the first effects. While aimlessly walking and staring at things, we stumbled upon a rope swing, which was attached to a long tree, with a 10m drop on the other side. We all took turns going around the tree with the swing and it was easily one of the highlights of the trip. After, one of my friends decided to take out one of his portable speakers and we started walking around again while blasting Pink Floyd from the speaker. When ""Welcome to the Machine"" came on, we all started chanting the lyrics together. It was one of the funnest experiences ever, but I'm sure to anyone not singing, we just sounded like tone deaf pigs. This was also around the point when I began seriously peaking. All the trees and bushes became wrapped in a very colourful pattern which resembled symbols and runes. I tried to find pictures to exemplify what I saw, but so far I haven't found anything similar. Since it was also the largest dosage of acid I had ever taken, throughout the day, I was having extremely intense self discussion. I decided to distance myself from the rest of my friends, and ended up sitting on a log. I put my headphones on and listened to Sigur Ros' - ""Glosoli"" 
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz8iEJeh26E

While listening to the song, it felt as nature around me was pulsating to the beat of the song.
Without even paying much attention, I noticed that I began to question my whole life, purpose and everything in between. However, towards the build up of the song, I was able to conclude that I'm very content with who and where I am. As the song climaxed after the buildup, I felt as if i was overtaken by intense happiness and joy, unlike any I've ever felt before. As I looked up to the sky, I felt so grateful for everything in my life and became truly amazed of the beauty of music and nature. I seriously don't remember when was the last time I was that happy and content with everything. After spending 4 hours aimlessly walking around and getting lost at every turn, we decided to leave the forest. Since it was already getting dark, we decided to go to a park and watch the fireworks. While on the walk I experienced a very odd phenomena. While walking, I decided to turn my head around and see if all my friends were still with us. As I turned my head back, I felt a slight twitch in my body, and as I felt it, the colours and hallucinations I saw, became slightly less colourful and vibrant. This similar twitch kept occurring a few times for the next 30 minutes, with the hallucinations and colours becoming less and less colourful and intense. Have any of you ever had similar experiences? This was my third time doing acid, and I've never experienced anything like it. Back to the story, we went to the park and enjoyed the fireworks for the next few hours, before we all decided to go home. 

Overall it was my most fun and interesting Canada Day thus far

1370100911.0,18,self.LSD,1fgtph,"First trip, wow.",20,2,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/LSD/comments/1fgtph/first_trip_wow/,"I think I had a decently interesting first time, so I thought I'd share. :)

I thought I was going on a pretty typical camping trip with a few friends (names obviously changed): Michelle, odd friend from high school. Justin, goofy high school junior. Ricky, ex-boyfriend high school senior. Ricky had a nice old camper way up in the woods, so secluded it was only accessible by a 10-15 minute Wrangler ride. The first few hours were pretty uneventful; watched Justin get super drunk, went fishing and cooked catfish over the open flame, danced half-naked in the dark, fun stuff.

After it was good and dark, Ricky surprised us (...kinda) by pulling out a baggie of weed. Okay, cool, haven't done that in a while! He and I passed the joint back and forth, and Michelle took a couple hits as well, but it's not really her thing. Pretty soon, we put out the fire and moved into the camper to chill. Justin took up residence on one mattress and promptly passed out, while the other three of us squeezed onto the other and waited to feel the buzz. For me, it never actually came (I suspect he had some bunk stuff). And then, Ricky pulled out a sheet of maze blotters. Michelle was a little *too* excited, and grabbed a tab from him with enthusiasm, no thought involved, exclaiming ""LET'S DO THIIIIS!"". I was a little hesitant, not wanting to get into something I didn't know much about. He said, ""You'll be fine, it's not scary. Colors are more colorful and details are more detailed, and patterns look weird."" He went on to explain his experience with it, and it didn't sound as bad as parents/teachers/society had lead me to believe. He claimed these tabs were low potency and only last a few hours. I decided to be safe and take half a tab just in case, considering I'm 90 pounds and tend to be a lightweight when it comes to anything.

Tab goes in my mouth and it tastes a little acidic (no pun intended), but not bitter. My tongue started going a little numb. I hated the taste and despite Ricky telling me to hold it in my mouth, I swallowed after 15-30 seconds. We all laid down on top of each other again and just talk, waiting for it to kick in. I kind of forgot I even did it.

A little while later, I sat up and suddenly notice that the plaid pattern on the curtains was buzzing and swirling. ""Whoa, guys, *look*!"" Both of them sat up and noticed it, too. I touched my face and noted that it felt super weird, and kind of numb. I quickly started feeling a little...off. My stomach was numb, but I could feel that telltale nauseous feeling, but there's nothing I hate in the world more than throwing up, so I tried to fight off the feeling. Ricky found the brown paper bag that was our garbage bag, just in case, and handed it to me. I clutched onto it and held it up to my face, not feeling so great. Then, I suddenly noticed I had put my entire head into the bag, staring at the way the light came through it. What the fuck? That was the moment I realized I was starting to trip.

Then, I felt completely awful all at once. Suddenly, I was standing at the door of the camper. Suddenly, the door was open and I was on my hands and knees, puking like I was exorcising a demon. Suddenly, there were hands rubbing my back and holding my hair back. At this point, my entire body was numb. When you throw up, it's the most awful feeling in the entire world and you feel that burning in every cell of your body for hours. I felt nothing. I simply saw the puke come out. Suddenly, how the fuck did I get there?! Did I just teleport?! The feeling of time shifting around like that is indescribable with English words. It gave me a sort of sick vertigo that felt ominous. When I snapped back into reality, I looked down and saw dark red, instilling a terror in me. ""Is that blood?"" seemed like the right thing to ask. Ricky insisted it wasn't, and kept rubbing my back. I heard Michelle yell at me for puking on her. I looked up and saw the light and shadows in the far away trees, and the contrast was striking. I decided that I didn't want to hallucinate a Slenderman, and closed my eyes. Then, I was suddenly on the mattress again.

This tripped me out hard and apparently I kept asking the same thing over and over again, ""Is this real? Did I just puke? I did?! Oh god. Wow. That wasn't real. Is this real? Did I just puke?"" I couldn't even believe that it was real life.I decided to sit right where I was and not move again, because the feeling made me nervous. It felt like a super odd dream that I kept waking up in over and over again. Pretty quickly, the trip was *on*. For all of us. (Except Justin, who was still passed out.) We sat in a circle staring at all of our hands and laughing at them. In less time than a split second, the three of us turned into beams of color, and traveled across the universe for thousands of years, and then came to rest in the camper. I felt an intense bond with them that ran incredibly deep after that moment, and tried to explain what had just happened, but couldn't find the words. 

That feeling when you're about to fall asleep and jerk back awake? I seemed to feel that every couple of minutes. The walls dripped and air flowed with color. I would watch this with amazement, and then snap into a different dream. Each time, it felt like I was gently falling from the ceiling back into the space that was my body. Except for the fact that I wasn't convinced I had a body. I was simply existence, existing in the place where my body was at that point in time. I couldn't feel *anything*. At this point, because I felt like I was far from physical, I had no control over my voice. My voice and thoughts were two very separate things. I observed myself talking like I was a separate being, though I hardly knew I was saying anything. I just kept rambling on. From this point on, I probably could have written some song lyrics better than the Beatles.

Justin hears this commotion and sits up a bit, rubs his eyes, and stares at us for a moment. ""Did you guys do LSD?!"" This made me remember that I had, in fact, done that. I was *so* excited that he was here now, and awake! He could join in our journey! I replied, ""JUSTIN! Justin! We did LSDdddddd..."" and that's all I could consciously control before it turned into some dribble like ""Oh god and it's like I'm dreaming, I'm dreaming and then I'm over there and then here and then I'm dreaming over there again and I'm dreaming but I'm not dreaming because I'm here but I'm not here because I'm dreaming and hi Justin, is this real? Am I dreaming this? Or is this dreaming me? Help, Justin, I love you."" He stared at me blankly before bursting into laughter.

He talked to us for a while and got caught up with what had happened. Michelle looked like a crack addict on withdrawal and was shaking and couldn't speak full words. She would pull at her neck and scream ""There's so much... SKIIIN!"", etc. but Ricky wasn't really tripping and helped her through it. Justin decided that dealing with us all required more vodka, and he grabbed the nearby bottle of Smirnoff. This set me off and just about triggered a really bad trip. My logic was that if I kept teleporting and 'losing time' and things were happening seemingly without cause, then as long as that bottle of vodka existed in front of me, then I could drink the entire thing without consciously doing it, and I would die. ""JUSTIN PUT THAT AWAY RIGHT NOW. PLEASE. I DON'T WANNA DIE, PLEASE DON'T LET ME DIE..."" he tried to talk me through it but I wasn't that logical obviously. Soon, though, the best thought ever hit my illogical brain - Justin isn't tripping, and he can keep us safe in the 'real world'. He won't let anything bad happen to us. After that, I completely relaxed and let the acid have its way with me, and stopped fighting it. I embraced the trip and enjoyed the shit out of it.

We had Ricky's phone playing on shuffle, so there was all different types of music playing. Dubstep was *amazing*, because I still had slight amounts of time distortion that drew some notes out for what felt like hours, making them sound like they were chewed up, digested, and spat back out in my face. Eminem played, and I could see the song when I closed my eyes.

I came down off the peak after that, and things turned slightly more uneventful. Justin moved to our side of the camper and sat with me, since I still didn't want to move. Michelle and Ricky moved to the other mattress and tried to work through her issues. I yelled out unhelpful advice from the other side, just trying to look out for everyone. Everything was funny, but I had no real control over my laugh and it came out odd every time. It was an effortless and beautiful laugh, though, and I felt that euphoric feeling in my head like it was disconnected from the actual laugh. Everything was beautiful and I loved everything and everyone. I tried to explain to everyone how the everything was interconnected and there are no coincidences; how we are the in the Universe but the Universe is also inside of us; how everything will always be okay in the end. They all wrote it off as babbling, but I felt like it was all of dire importance that I tell everyone these things.

Justin and Ricky decided to interview me to see what I would say, since I still had little control over my words. 
""Who is the president of the United States?""
""Barack Obama.""
""Good! Who was the president before Barack Obama?""
""William Schaffer. ... ... Wait. Who's William Schaffer?"" (I still have no idea.)
""hehe lol haha""
""ASK ME ANYTHING I AM YOUR ORACLE""
""Okay. What do I need to do in life?""
""Justin...come on. I'm not your oracle just because I did LSD. You need to find that inside yourself!""

...etc. It was fun to play around with my logic. :P 

After that, Justin and I laid on our backs and I watched the rainbow kaleidoscope patterns on the ceiling and we talked about the inner workings of the Universe until he passed out again. Then, I focused on trying to help Michelle get back to Earth, as I was starting to come down but she was still struggling to really even talk. We all decided she shouldn't do it again. Six hours later, she was still unable to come back into reality. However, after a bit of sleep, she told me the next day that it was the most incredible experience of her life. I think we were all changed by the experience significantly.

That was long, but I thought it was worth describing in detail. Having only smoked pot and gotten drunk before, and still being ""in my own head"", I definitely wasn't quite prepared for the way LSD just shot me like a cannon out of my entire existence. I can only imagine what a full tab or more will do to me, but it definitely wasn't my last time.

Thanks in advance!

EDIT:  Decided to swallow 1 and 1/2 tabs to test if it was an nBome...  Sure enough, I was tripping in less than an hour.  Guess I know I have good quality LSD :)  

By the way, smoked some weed about forty five minutes after swallowing the tabs (since it was a pretty low dose), and while it made the trip pretty intense, I definitely prefer acid by itself.

I have a question I would love to ask of other users, but please allow me to preframe first. 

I have been enjoying LSD for 28 years and when I was a teenager we always tripped on Friday night and go out and party. 

When I was in my twenties and thirties I would trip at concerts and festivals or at home.

Now I am in my forties I trip for spiritual reasons. I meditate and try to induce altered states of consciousness.  

Now that I am older I feel compelled to trip with purpose and not just to get fucked up. I kinda feel like I have to have a special occasion to take the acid and just party with friends or go out to do something, even though I love the hell out of it.

Oneof my favorite activities while trippin: Video games! Either stand up arcade style or Team Fortress or BF2 they are awesome. Not to mention how well I play when I am on LSD. For those who game I ended one BF2 round 189/3 and I was rushing the other team the whole round.

If my wife is willing sex is unbelievable. Walking around in nature and cloud watching. The sky and nature become their own screen saver when you are trippin.

What activities do others enjoy when trippin? 

Am I the only one who reveres the trip and tries to use it for spiritual goodness?

Alcohol tastes like rubbish to me, cigarettes just seem like a pointless and expensive addiction, etc etc.

LSD and other psychedelics, however, fascinate me. As an amateur lucid dreamer, I love the idea of hallucination and reality distortion, the idea that each trip can be an introspective and colorful journey.

But I have two questions:

1. Would be a bad idea to try it as my first real drug, or should I gradually ease into it by trying other drugs first? A friend of mine said he would try and hook me up with some cannabis later this week. I don't know if that will happen or not.
 
1. Where would I even get LSD if I wanted it? I live in a pretty slow southern town right now, but I'll be going to college in Boston starting this September. But I don't really *know* anyone. I'm not the type to go the night clubs or anything. Where would I even find it? What dosage is ""safe"" for a first trip?

Thanks to a trip that I experienced 3 days ago, it seems that I am done with LSD. The trip took place in my apartment with 2 of my best childhood friends. Neither of them had ever tripped acid before, but were quite experienced with other mind altering drugs such as 2c-i, amanita, psilocybin, DXM, MDMA, etc… We had all tripped multiple times together with no issues, but for some reason things took a horribly negative turn this night. 

	My two friends (who I will call N and D) decided to come up from our hometown to stay in my new apartment in Asheville for the night and reminisce. Not long ago someone had given me a new acid connection and claimed that it was very very strong. I remembered that N and D both had mentioned wanting to try LSD so I called them up and set the plan in motion. We decided on a 10 strip which was the low low price of 60 dollars. Around 9 o' clock we left to pick up the strip. I walked into the house and paid the man. I was then presented with 10 sour patch kids which had just been prepared with LSD a few minutes ago. I knew that it was going to be intense, but I wasn't prepared for the hell that those gummy kids would unleash. 

	The apartment was empty, thank god. It was just us 3. All of my roommates were gone for the night and wouldn't be getting back until late the next day. We took the acid at 10:00 with D taking 1 1/2, I took 1 and N took 1. 

T+30 10:30. Definitely beginning to feel it. We were all shaking, like you do on the come up. Out of nowhere D started to sweat PROFUSELY. 'Odd' I thought to myself, 'Never seen that before'. After he soaked through a shirt, it was over and he was totally fine. We all laid on my bed and talked about our time in high school. Overall the trip was already more intense than anything that I had experienced before. 

T+1:00 11:00. The bedroom was nice, but we all decided to move to the living room to watch TV. Everything was fine with D and I, but we could tell that N was starting to act odd. He walked to the bathroom and came out asking me what time it was and when the trip would be over. I reassured him multiple times that it would all wear off and just to relax and enjoy it. For some reason we all then decided to take the rest of our acid. HUGE MISTAKE. D upped his dose to 3 hits and N and I upped ours to 2. N was still making sense and stuck to reality at this point. N

T+2:00 12:00. Something is wrong with N. He is constantly getting up and sitting down, mumbling to himself, and not making much sense. At this point he could still make statements about what was happening. D and I are just relaxing and watching television, hoping that N will get over this hump and start enjoying the trip again. 

T+2:30 12:30. I look over at N and realize that he is masturbating on my couch. Something was NOT right. He had this smile on his face that just screamed ""Nothing is wrong, whats the problem?"" His face was stuck in this smile all night long, and I will never forget it. As soon as I saw what was happening I stood up and told him to take it to the bathroom. His response was that we should all masturbate each other to which D and I outright rejected. This is where the night got crazy.

T+3:00 1:00. All night long N would make advances on D and I and randomly masturbate. His pants just seemed to keep coming off. At one point he even jumped up and grabbed my crotch. I had to physically push him away from me and tell him that what he was doing was not right. This is the point that he ""broke"". Right after all this he began to repeat the same things over and over with no real meaning. he said things like ""It was such a great time"" ""It was the worst dream ever"" ""So whats up? Where are we going?"" ""Its all word"" and he would just repeat those things over and over in different orders. 

T+4:00 2:00. N is starting to make remarks like ""A is going to kill himself!"" at the top of his lungs. During this time he also said things like ""I've just got to go see my mom, are you guys coming?"" He would then stand up and try to go outside to his car. I had to physically restrain him multiple times, as he tried to do this all night long with more and more force each time. 

T+5:00 3:00. Goddamn it he is smoking in my apt and ashing everywhere. D hides his cigarettes. N starts to mumble that he isn't gay over and over. He makes multiple homosexual slurs, and then admits to being gay. He then starts with the slurs again. All with a horrifying smile and repeating the previous statements. 

T+6:00 4:00. N still has no clue that he has done anything. The remarks that someone is going to kill themselves became much more intense at this point. Eventually he starts to mumble that we are all one person and starts to hold his breath. Not good. He eventually starts breathing again and pees his pants all over my couch. While tripping, D and I have to take his piss stained pants and wash them in the machine. I give him my underwear and a fresh pair of pants, since he cannot be walking around with none. He thanks me and goes back to sitting on the piss couch. 

T+7:00 5:00. N is obviously tired and trying to go to sleep (Which he had been talking about doing all night) on our couch. He keeps trying to lie on his face, which is very dangerous and D and I have to constantly flip him over. His pants are back off. He puts them back on and lies down again. He instantly falls asleep. 

T+7:15 5:15. N wakes up and looks horrified. He is back in reality but still tripping a little bit. He asks us what happened last night and we tell him. He is obviously shocked at it. He goes back to sleep and D and I try to explain what happened to each other. 

Aftermath: I saw a broken human that night and it has forever changed how I view LSD. If any of my roommates had come home early my friend would be in a hospital without a doubt. LSD can be an amazingly enlightening experience, but people seem to forget that there is also a very negative and dark side to the drug. N is still coming to terms with what happened, and so are D and I. I will never be the same after this experience and I want people to see this so they can be prepared in case it happens to them or a friend. All in all, I had to physically restrain my best friend from molesting me and killing himself. That is nothing that a human should have to experience while experiencing the most intense trip of his life. That is all.

There were about eight of us, some were new to it and some weren't. I had never dropped before but I was enthusiastic and ready for the experience. We went over to my friend's house, dosed up, took a few bong hits and prepared ourselves. Soon enough, I was tripping. The lines on the wall were swirling and I had a sweet head buzz going. We were out on the back deck smoking cigarettes just enjoying the experience when we saw what looked like pulsing light off in the distance. There was something that looked like a fire but also a blue light that kept flashing to a rhythm. Since we were on acid, we each naturally thought it was in our heads. But when we realized we were all seeing this light, curiosity ensued. We decided to venture over the hill and check it out. As we walked over there I felt like we were making some grand journey to discover the meaning of this pulsing light. After making it over the hill, I saw something truly amazing considering my state of mind. There were about 20 people watching a girl spin a blue light-up hula hoop while a guy was spinning fire, all to the beat of Umphrey's Mcgee. For those who don't know what spinning fire is, its when one takes two torches that are attached to metal chains and spins them around in cool patterns. You can imagine this blew my fucking mind, and this guy was good. When they were done, we got to talking and it turns out these people were straight acid heads. They dropped all the time. After a long conversation about drugs, we got their contact info and went our separate ways (but not before buying a gram of some dank weed from them first). Successful first trip.

tl;dr

First time tripping, saw pulsing lights in the distance, went to check it out and it was some hippies spinning fire and doing tricks with hula hoops.  ",,False,,t5_2qhvj,False,,,True,t3_1j111n,http://www.reddit.com/r/LSD/comments/1j111n/first_time_tripping_had_an_awesome_experience/,

For me, the ""Ah good I'm tripping moment"" is the presence of a certain type of visual. Let me see if I can explain it, but you have all probably seen it. 

They'll be an image I'm looking at, be it, lichens on a rock, or a rug, or something, and my brain will find reference ""points"", some sort of intersection or outcropping, and from that point will spring a flowing Mandelbrot set, but the set won't be solitary, it will be interacting with every other reference point on whatever image or object I'm looking at. 

For your reference, [here is](http://imgur.com/Ywdu2A7) a sort of image I created, with a multitude of mandelbrots springing from various points, only imagine, that these points don't exist in a grid, but rather, a cornucopia of different patterns that articulate whatever structure they're clinging to.

I tripped with my girlfriend. We took a tab at about 3PM, and went walking to the Japanese Gardens in Buenos Aires.  [Here's a pic of the place](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-UFVdmJcui78/TaQ033sS3mI/AAAAAAAAArA/UT0T-3jozAo/s1600/capital-federal-jardin-japones.jpg). While coming up, we walked around it, took in the architecture and the nature, and had a blast feeding the koi fish and touching them. As the peak was coming, we went to the restaurant within the gardens and had *the best goddammned cup of tea ever*. As it was getting dark and we were peaking, we went to the Planetary (a small sort of space museum thing). We got there at 7 PM and attended the Planetary's show. That was INTENSE. They sit you in a circular auditorium beneath the dome and project a pseudo-3D documentary of the roof of the dome itself. AMAZING STUFF. We were both clutching hands and marvelling at how intense the documentary was. Seeing the stars, nebulae and other celstial bodies projected on a huge dome above us really blew our minds.

After the show, all psyched up, we went outside the Planetarium. [This is what it looks like at night](http://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2011/05/Buenos-Aires-Saturn-Planetario-LED-ed1.jpg). We spent the next few hours of the trip listening to music (Arion, particularly, which you *must* listen to on acid sometime if you like prog-rock) and playing pois and light staffs.

All in all, an amazing, innovative trip. Have any of you guys ever done something similar?

Bad thing is we only have one picture to commemorate the trip. [Here is me, tripping out, with my light staff next to me, feeding the koi.](https://p.twimg.com/AtXCK6DCIAEC-Qi.jpg)

1322911203.0,16,self.LSD,myn4t,Bad Trip,22,6,43,http://www.reddit.com/r/LSD/comments/myn4t/bad_trip/,"Yesterday I had a terrible trip.  It was my second time on LSD, on about 1.5 tabs.  My first time was only on 1 tab, and was one of the best and happiest experiences of my life.  I probably peaked around 5 hours ago and was still feeling it pretty strongly up until 8 hours or so.  I had pretty strong visuals (although mostly just when my eyes were closed), but I still saw and felt all the stereotypical things one would expect while on LSD.  Everyone I tripped with had similar feelings and had a good time.

This time, I tripped with the same people.  For whatever reason, we all started to come down around 4 hours in, and none of us felt or saw the same sort of things as the first time (which was the first for all of us).  As we were coming down, one of us had the idea to smoke some marijuana.  I had never smoked before, and as such was fairly nervous (although I had thought I had completely sobered up from the LSD).  We all went down to someone else's room to smoke, and I only took one hit, but everything went downhill from there.  

I didn't really feel bad yet, but I started to lose sense of where I was and what was going on around me.  Whenever one of my friends addressed me, I just went with the flow without know what I was doing or what conversation was taking place without me.  I soon realized that the visuals from the acid were hitting me again, only slightly at first but stronger than ever soon enough.  My first reaction was to warn my friends what was going on, and that even if we felt sober the acid was still in our bodies.  I could not express this in words, however, no matter how hard I tried, and everyone else just acted normal.  Huge pains started searing through my body, however, and I soon somehow managed to communicate to one of my friends that I needed to go back to the previous dorm room we were in where I felt safer.  

The walk upstairs was one of the strangest and scariest moments of my life.  Ever step I took, my head roared with pain, and scenery turned completely black and white.  It was an extremely ""strong"" black and white, in a similar fashion to strong bright colors one expects to see on LSD, if that makes any sense.  It was at this point that I first realized that I was experiencing a bad trip.  Everything around me seemed to speed up, and I felt like I was hugging on to my friend for dear life.  The strangest part is, in actuality I was walking fairly normally, when I felt like I was going insane.  I occasionally had ""dark"" thoughts, and felt very cold.  It is extremely hard for me to describe exactly what I felt; just that it was probably the worst experience in my life.  Once we finally reached the room, I started to calm down, but I was still freaking out for at least 3 more hours.  I felt like I was acting extremely strangely and had no idea and no control over what was going on with my body.  I repeatedly asked whether or not my friends thought I was crazy and if I was acting strangely, yet they said I was acting normally aside from the repeated asking.

When a sober friend I called to come help me finally came and talked to me, I understood that what I was feeling was a combination of drugs reacting poorly in my body and that everything was eventually going to be okay.  This is honestly the one thing that I feel kept me from going insane.  Whenever I asked someone if I was crazy or not, they said no, you are fine.  When I knew that inside my body I felt absolutely horrible and my mind was racing and thinking indescribable things, this is not what you want to hear.  I knew I was acting very strangely, but no one would agree with me.  When my sober friend talked to me and agreed with others that to an outsider I may seem fine but drugs were fucking with my mind, all I did was try and outlast the drug until I could be sober again.

Even though I understood that my feeling of craziness was self-induced, I had no control over my body and it still took a fairly long time for me to completely go back to normal again.

I am writing this post for two reasons.  First of all, PLEASE know what you are getting into when you do LSD.  I will most likely do LSD again--I understand that this trip was out of the ordinary and was most likely due to my increased anxiety in smoking weed for the first time.  I definitely felt my heart-rate increase a ton, most likely pumping the chemicals throughout my bloodstream and exemplifying the effects to a large degree.  Nevertheless, LSD is a drug that fucks with your mind.  You must be in a good mental state if you want to have a good trip.  If you are nervous at all, DO NOT use the drug.  It will not end well.  I fucking knew perfectly well that I was acting completely insane, and there was absolutely nothing I could do about it.  It is not a fun feeling.

Second of all, I was hoping there was someone I could talk to who had a similar experience as I did.  When I finally calmed down and people asked me what the fuck made me do what I did, I could not describe to them what I was feeling.  I don't believe I could unless they too experienced the same effects, much as like one cannot describe certain good aspects of LSD to someone unless they too have taken it.  I know I had a bad trip, and it was the worst experience of my life.  It is really fucking scary to know that my brain is capable of doing such things that I never would have expected from someone not in a mental institution.  I really would like to talk to someone who had a similar experience, as I wonder how this will change my life in the future and whether or not there will be any permanent damage.

Sorry for the long post, and thanks for reading it all if you did.  Even if you didn't, writing this all down made me feel better about what happened, so I guess there's that...",,False,,t5_2qhvj,False,,,True,t3_myn4t,http://www.reddit.com/r/LSD/comments/myn4t/bad_trip/,

I've read a lot of people saying ""you don't find LSD, it finds you"". Whether that holds truth or not, through a sequence of recent events that would I would have deemed rather improbable, I've happened to acquire myself 100 hits of liquid acid. Potency unknown, but my trusted source reckons it's pretty good stuff.

I wouldn't say I'm a newbie to acid, but I've never dosed the liquid kind before, let alone owned a whole vial of it - it's always been blotters in small quantity.

So, I'm looking for advice from anyone that's had such experience - How best should I store it? What was your first liquid dose? Can I mix it with alcohol / soft drinks, and for how long? If *you* had 100 doses, how much would you take at once? Any other advice for someone considering a large dose for the first time?

I've been trying to get hold of some good acid in South Africa for months, so I'm pretty excited to have finally lucked out big time, especially just when I'd almost given up hope!

Outsider coming in to ask for some perspective on the uses of this stuff. I'm a casual lucid dreamer and lately my interests have expanded out over to psychedelics because I heard from this very interesting LondonReal podcast episode interviewing a psychedelics researcher that these drugs can be used as tools much in the same way that meditation and dreams can be used as tools to solve problematic quirks in a person's personality or change their outlook on life, mentally heal them.

I've almost gotten to my point, bear with me here. As far as I'm aware the way psychedelics do what they do is by turning off parts of the brain that are normally on while we're awake. And that sort of ""overrides"" some of the protective systems the brain has in place so that we don't experience visual imagery or dreamy hallucinatory imagery whilst awake.

My understanding is this means that all the crazy hallucinatory stuff happens from you losing perception of external sensory, from you having an absense of external stimulation, and that is what brings all this crazy stuff out of you and lets you experience it. So what does stimulating yourself do for the trip? Why the mixtapes, why the TV shows and movies? Wouldn't that lessen the trip? Sounds boring to me!

One time I was browsing this forum called DreamViews.com. Maybe you've heard of it if you're a lucid dreamer. There was this guy who talked about how one day he decided to try something new with lucid dreaming. He decided to become lucid, find a nice cozy spot in his dream world, plop down on the ground and essentially meditate for a while. THAT IS WHEN ALL THE COOL CRAZY TRIPPY SHIT HAPPENED FOR HIM! When he decided to plop down and do nothing! (footnote, all the people who gave it a try came back supporting his findings) Why? Because once he decided to sit down and quiet himself, he left the closedminded, boring normalcy of the first person perspective and of being grounded in this body. 

A trip is all about getting outside of your head, escaping your body in my eyes, maybe I'll have a different perspective if I go off and try it, maybe I'm naive and thinking of all psychedelics as the same and if that's the case go ahead and tell me that. Those with the experience are the authority on the subject, obviously. But it seems to me that to free yourself from the shackles of reality one should go inside their OWN HEAD instead of floating somewhere in the middle. Why would that be fun?

Or doses hundreds of times heavier than regular (thumbprints). Why do you do it?

But first, let me tell about my own experience: I've done acid 4 times. The first three were generally fun times, enjoying the intense visuals but nothing spiritually enlightening, hence wanting to do it again after every time. The fourth time around though, I had the mysteries of the universe unravel before my own eyes, clearer than I could have ever expected it. It changed my worldview and answered most of my questions. In no specific order, here are my revelations that I managed to write down:

The human mind does have its limitations and we have trouble comprehending several concepts: infinity, nothingness (void), existence and randomness. The universe has always existed, there was no beginning, simple as that. I don't think the mind IS the universe but that it simply evolved enough to be able to perceive and comprehend some of it around us. The potential for human knowledge is finite due to our mental limitations, therefore there are questions that will never be answered and I'm fine with it. Such as how can anything exist? What exactly happens at the singularity? I believe the universe is NOT fully deterministic because freedom of choice exists and because at microscopic scale true randomness exists. It also became evident that there is another ""force"" in nature that drives all things that are conscious and is essential to their existence. Some call it God, I choose to call it ""love"". It comes into play where intelligent life begins. We have but one life to live, so better make the most out of it. The purpose of life boils down to pure, unconditional love: spreading it and creating life yourself. Giving yourself completely to another person. I had the strongest awareness of the hivemind and a strong sense that somewhere out there someone was reaching out for me like I was reaching out for them, us being perfect soulmates, perfectly complimenting each other, like yin and yang. Pure happiness for me just might be the ability to completely share myself and the essence of my being with another person. I have come to believe that true enlightenment means being able to accept death with all the implications but no fear whatsoever and I found that to be an undesirable state as in my view it would essentially make one's life meaningless. The concept of ""living"" would boil down simply to distracting yourself from the fact that you are going to die. Life is essentially the only thing that is not infinite and I just need to summon the courage to deal with it, rather than procrastinate and distract myself. Every second counts.

Generally I can't imagine taking acid without having any specific questions I want to ask myself during the trip. As I understand it, I experienced strong ego softening during that trip where some of the big picture came into clear view. I understand the concept of ego death but I don't see it as a desirable state at all. Can someone explain to me what does one learn from ego death?",,False,,t5_2qhvj,False,,,True,t3_12wcc1,http://www.reddit.com/r/LSD/comments/12wcc1/i_think_ive_learned_everything_i_can_from_the/,
1351495813.0,16,self.LSD,129kcl,I don't peak unless I smoke weed?,17,1,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/LSD/comments/129kcl/i_dont_peak_unless_i_smoke_weed/,"So far I have tripped on acid 3 times. Each time I did not have a strong psychedelic experience until after I smoked a little bit of weed. Once I smoke I get launched. The experience is incredible. However, I find it strange that  the LSD has very minimal effects until I decide to smoke. 

Quick background info: 
I don't smoke much (well, I vape), maybe once a week. Usually I get very high and get nice closed-eye visuals. I don't drink or smoke tobacco. Only other drug I tried was ecstasy, which was just once.

Time of smoking after dosing:

- 1st trip: +4 hours (1 1/2 tabs)

- 2nd trip: +6-7 hours (1 tab)

- 3rd trip: +8-9 hours (half a tab)

As you can see my dosages aren't very high, however the tabs taken for my 2nd and 3rd trips were rated at 200ug to 250ug. This acid is from a reputable seller on Silk Road. I assume that the actual amount should at least be anywhere from 100ug to 200ug each.

The period of time before I smoke there is not much happening at all. On my 2nd trip I noticed the clouds ""breathing"" a bit and moving wisp-ily. After smoking...HOLY BALLS. On my 3rd trip I just had a very slight generic uplifted, calm high...and stayed at this level for 8-9 hours (I admit I was aiming for a casual dose anyway but I was at least expecting more)! Then after vaping a modest pack of weed I was tripping quite adequately  minutes later. I watched an episode of Adventure Time, then for the next 1-2 hours everything I looked at was overlayed with small fractal patterns of Jake's face; lot's of yellow and big black eyes. To me this experience felt like a weed high on steroids; overall a strong experience.

I googled around and it seems like most people experience a peak at about 2-3 hours after dosing. Like I said, I feel almost no come-up; I come-up a bit in 1 hour and just stay there. For my next trip I definitely want to experiment with taking 2 maybe 2 1/2 tabs of the same tabs rated at 200-250ug (probably more like 100-150ug given the two experiences I've had from them so far :/ ).

So, any thoughts?

And then the trip lasted **way** longer than it should, which put me so far over the edge I almost couldn't take it any more. We're talking 21 hours before the trip was finally completely over.

So, LSD, is it safe for me to try again? If I eliminate all of the things that freaked me out the last time (being alone and the trip lasting 21 hours) would it be safe for me to do again? Safe meaning I won't start tripping permanently, that is.

The onset of the trip was difficult because I was getting a migraine.  Unfortunately the migraine lasted through the whole trip and may have played a major part in the negativity of the whole thing.  

I have never once experienced anything less than amazing with LSD, and I knew right away that things were not going well.  I've taken both of these types of acid within the last month, as have several friends, and no one had any trouble.  I experienced many disturbing visual and aural hallucinations.  Once peaking I was finding it difficult to see clearly, and in a last ditch effort to control myself I began looking for a stash of benzos.  Medicine cabinet being empty, I began to get sick.  Sick from the migraine and sick with fear.  I was staring down the barrel of insanity and lucy was about to pull the trigger.

A mixture of terrible anxiety and nausea caused me to vomit several times, and by the time the sickness had taken hold I was beginning to loose my ability to see clearly, as in only seeing the LSD show.  I called my girlfriend to come over, and laid down in bed to wait.  I felt neurotic, sickly, and was very afraid of the acid.  The walls that typically breathe and dance bulged and throbbed.  Hawkwind sounded horrible and abrasive.  I did my best not to fight it but I kept finding myself pacing around the room. By the time she arrived I could no longer tell the difference between my eyes being open or closed.  The geometric patterns and lights were all I could see.  

She turned out the lights and laid next to me in bed.  We have tripped together and I found her to be incredibly comforting. She fell asleep and I continued to trip.  This lasted from 3am until the brightness of the mid-morning sun finally crept into my cave.  I as a person became irrelevant, and everything i've ever known dissolved into light.  I was exhausted, worn out.  During the trip I was very uncomfortable and was not having a good time at all.  After, I began to realize the importance of the event.  Of course the LSD had nothing to with the negativity I experienced. And to become more aware of internal anger and anxiety, and the power it has over my life is very important.

The greatest fear I have yet known was sitting on the edge of my bed trying to light a cigarette.  At the same time I was sitting in a chair next to the bedroom door, watching myself try to light a cigarette.  When I realized the version sitting on the bed didn't have a lighter I attempted to give myself a lighter, only to discover we had to work together and couldn't.  The idea that there were two of me, two different parts represented physically and not able to work together was terrifying.  I knew I had to figure out which of us was real, because when the trip was over one of us was going to disappear.  I feel like the separation of persons may have occurred by mixing two types of LSD though I know no science to back this up.  Several times throughout the night I found myself watching what I was doing across the room.  I enjoy meditation while on LSD, focusing on the experience makes it more powerful and insightful.  Yet this time everything I tried to ignore became more powerful.  I couldn't embrace it because it felt wrong, dark and dangerous.  And this cycle led me further into a temporary psychosis.  It is very possible that in an attempt to dose directly from the vial I took a larger dose than I meant to.

TLDR?  Took two hits, fully freaked, came back with new insights.  Bad trip, good experience.

I did it for the first time on Wednesday night (two days ago) and really enjoyed it. I did it with a few friends, and came up after hitting a gravity bong. My friend gave me an extra tab and told me to use it whenever.

I was planning on using it tomorrow night, Friday, because it is my last weekend of freedom before school starts (and I continue working as well). I, however, live alone in a studio apartment. Some details to help

* The place is relatively small
* It is very clean and organized
* I have access to a computer with 2 screens, and a very nice sound system attached
* I have a 28"" LCD TV hooked up to Netflix via my XBOX
* I have a small sofa that I can sit, but not lay on
* I have a twin size bed that faces both the TV and computer monitors
* I plan on getting some Hawaiian BBQ to save for my acid munchies later that night

Does it seem like I will have a good trip based on the situation above? I did not have any weird experiences last night that caused me to panic or anything, only a great and fun time.


EDIT: Thanks everyone for the great responses. I am going to wait until next weekend or the weekend after to do it to reset my tolerance. Appreciate it! 
Hopefully this was the right thing to post. Just want to make sure I'll be OK :)

I now realize how much bad acid I have had in my life. All the tabs that taste bitter; all the poorly drawn prints; all the uncomfortably wavey trips I've had,

I went to a festival and as usual all sorts of drug dealers came around selling their goods. There were subtle but noticeable signs that their acid was bunk (2c's or something of the sort) -- some had shifty eyes and poor rapport that made it clear that profits were their only motive. Some were even honest and told us their tabs were not LSD.

I uncharacteristically showed some restraint and held out. Then a young guy came around, let's call him ""M"". He came with nothing but a smile on his face. He sat down, introduced himself and had a general ease about him that made us all comfortable. He told us about these white on white tabs that he gets from an old Dead Head from Jersey. Without giving away too many details he, in his own way, let us know it was family acid. He had an earnest tone about him that was obviously not bullshit.

The come up was smooth as can be. All I could do was smile for hours, literally. I felt absolutely comfortable in public and had no trouble talking to strangers or expressing my mind. The visuals were so natural that they weren't in any way distracting (don't mistake that for a lack of visuals). The trip was remarkably long lasting and the come down was just as smooth as the come up.

I can't describe it any other way than pure love. I grew so much closer to the people I was with and I already have strong nostalgic sentiments about the trip.

This was the second trip for all of us.

Well the shtuff really kicked in strong right as we came across some rednecks with chainsaws and axes cutting a bunch of firewood (illegally). We started to get a little paranoid, but nothing major, and we carried on our way back to the car.

Then things started to get realllllly weird. We were all having a case of ""word soup."" I have only read about this occuring from crazy huge doses of L or from legitimate mental disorders. Perhaps I'm wrong and this is a pretty standard thing, but for those of you who don't know, word soup is when you are speaking at a normal pace, but none of your words go together or form thoughts. ""I'm to happen we keep hiking that tree's leaves are falling on our Forefathers' last trip to Cancun for a few dollars.""

Also, craaazy hallucinations. More than just a few optical wavies and whatnot. Like the whole word changed into a stretched out version of itself, very wide and short.

We got back to the car like 6 hours after dropping, (we thought that we would be able to drive at this point from our previous experience - piss poor planning) and went into a total and complete mindfuck. We were filled with complete panic and confusion. We couldn't complete more than a few words of a thought. Rednecks were driving by staring at us... Just a terrible experience all around.

Finally we made it out okay and I was fine with the experience after it was gone. I knew bad trips were a thing and I still learned from the journey and had a great time before and after things went sour.

Fast forward a month and a half... I drop again with one of those friends and another friend. Again, everything goes great. This was the best time I had ever had on LSD, no foul ups or mindfucks. Just ego death and pure enlightenment.

Then my friend (the one from the time before) says something's bugging him and gets a little scared. That was all it took to start my downward spiral and soon we were both having a bad trip again, although not nearly as bad as before. The entire time I had this fear that we would slip into the mindfuck again. Strangely, our friend who had never tripped before was calm and relaxed the entire time.

Both times, even after the bad trip was gone, I was left with a weird feeling that I couldn't shake off until the trip was over.

Now it's been several months, and I'd like to experiment with hallucinogens again this summer, but every time I think about it, I get scared of having another bad trip. And I know that if I had no fear of a bad trip, I probably wouldn't have one, but I still can't shake it. (Fear of going into a bad trip was the sole reason I had a bad trip the second time).

Anyone have tips for how I can get back on the horse and kill my fear? I'm planning on taking up mindfulness meditation.

(ALSO; how LSD saved my life) Share your experiences, advice, and AMA!",19,4,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/LSD/comments/ymnk5/a_few_experiences_to_anyone_interested_also_how/,"I first tried LSD at the age of 16, a friend of mine stumbled upon some LSD, and some DOI (DOI is a research chemical that is somewhat like a LSD trip, but lasts for around 25 hours instead of 14).

I watched as he took one tab of LSD and observed him for about four hours, the first two I later learned, he wasn't even tripping, as it takes around two hours for the drug to settle in. After a little bit of convincing, he gave me a tab. Without hesitation I threw it in my mouth and sucked on it as instructed for about 7 minutes before swallowing it. I didn't feel anything for about an hour and a half and I grew impatient. My friend took another tab, and offered me another as well. About five minutes after taking the second tab I stopped playing the impossible game, and glanced up at my ceiling, where my eyes stayed locked for about twenty minutes while I played the impossible game on my ceiling. After telling myself that this was impossible, I looked around. My room seemed smaller, the colors seemed a lot more vibrant, and textures popped. I had a glued-together-puzzle on my wall, the edges where each piece met another seemed to be far more significant than ever before. It wasn't until I started tracing my fingers along the cracks of the puzzle that I admitted to myself that I was in-fact tripping. 

Considering the stage of my life at the time, it wasn't a smart idea to have taken LSD. At the time I was unsatisfied with life, my mom and dad had been fighting a lot, I had lost one my favorite aunts, and for about two weeks before this I was contemplating suicide. About forty minutes after playing with the puzzle, I was leaning, almost laying back in my computer chair. I set a water bottle on my head, because I was enjoying the coolness from it. After a few moments I had an out of body experience, where I stood over my body, looking at myself. For a brief second I was a little scared, but I decided that I needed to let the drug do what it was meant to do, before I freaked myself out. While standing over myself I realized many things about myself. As I looked I judged myself, I saw how unhappy I was when really life wasn't as bad as I was making it. I realized how foolish I was to have ever even considered suicide, and how strongly it would have effected my family. I realized how loved I was, by my family and friends. And lastly I realized that I was only going to be as happy as I made myself, that you can't rely on others to make you happy. I realized that I was being a pathetic loser, and only myself could change it.

After that night, I changed a lot. First of all I'm obviously still alive, and secondly, I no longer take all the things in this world for granted. LSD has close to made me a hippie, I look around the world and see beautiful things, great things, that almost everyone in the world just sees past, takes for granted. Almost every night I sit outside and look at the sky, thinking about life, thinking about how each day is a new miracle. I think about things in a much different way than most do, and I feel that it is a much better way. 

For those that are contemplating doing LSD, DOI, mushrooms, DMT, or any other psychedelic drug there is only so much advice to be given. 

First of all, don't do anything stupid.

Secondly, I highly recommend doing it in a safe environment, for example, I don't suggest doing it at home in your room with your mom in the room over, until you build somewhat of a tolerance to the drug, and you can control yourself well enough to act like you are not tripping. (yes that is very easily possible) An example of a safe environment would be your friend-who-lives-alone-house, or your friends house with their parents gone. If you are highly worried about your first experience, I suggest a baby sitter, someone who has tripped enough to be alright whilst tripping, or someone who will be sober that night.  

Third, there is no way out once you do the drug. You cannot end it, you have to ride it out the whole way through. If you try and end it before it is over, it will only make you panic. Don't do it. Also, don't try to sleep, it won't work. (""it's a bit hard to sleep with these walls melting"" -First time user friend) I've only ever seen one person able to sleep while tripping, and it was because of the extremely large 
quantity of marijuana he smoked so he could sleep. 

Though there is only so much advice to be given, I can share some experiences of my own. 

After the first time I decided that no other drug would ever compare to how great my first LSD trip was. I however since then have tried a few. I have smoked marijuana and JWH which is a chemical that gives the same high as marijuana, just much more intense. I personally didn't like either, as I am not a fan of my sense of time being slowed. 

I have also tried mushrooms far more times than once, and I very much enjoy them. It is NOT the same trip as LSD, nor is it what many people make it out to be. You don't get visuals strong enough to make animations, so you won't be seeing things that are not there. (for example, sorry, but you won't be talking to smurfs while on shrooms) All of my experiences have led me to conclude that shrooms simply enhance textures, and colors. Shrooms also give you a body high, that makes you feel.. somewhat like you are made of jelly. Also, your emotions are enhanced. For example if you watch movies or shows, things in them will seem very dramatic. I, for example, watched Toy Story 3 while on shrooms, and every action in that movie seems so incredibly epic, and I'll be damned if I wasn't almost in tears and gasping when they were falling into the fire pit. 

I have also tried DOI, and DMT. DOI is a research chemical, that once swallowed gives you the same trip as an LSD/acid trip. However the trip takes about two hours to settle in, and once it starts it gets more and more intense for about 12 hours. Once at 12 hours it levels out, and stays at that intensity for anywhere from another 8 hours, to another 18 hours, as it lasts anywhere from 20-30 hours. DMT on the other hand is a naturally occurring chemical in your brain. It is released when you sleep, when you die, and when you are born. It is the chemical that causes you to dream, see your life flash before your eyes, and what helps you learn when you are first born. When you smoke DMT, you have very intense visuals. Possibly the most intense visuals that anything could offer. I've had many experiences with it, and though I won't share them because I feel like DMT is something that you can only picture once you have done it, I can say that it was one of the most amazing things I have ever done. I can also say that there is a documentary on Netflix about it, that I recommend watching if you are interested, as well as a clip on youtube that does a fairly decent job portraying what a DMT experience is like. 

As for LSD and Acid trips, I have had many experiences. I now have an entirely new appreciation for nature, music, and many emotions. Such as love, and peace. It has given me a whole new outlook on religion, friendship, and family. And I can honestly say that I no longer take things for granted. Things that people see and just look past. Things like the sky, weather, trees and flowers, even architecture. Things like families, couples, love, and friends. Things like music, movies, and other forms of entertainment. 


TL;DR = During an LSD trip I realized that I was being foolish and didn't want too commit suicide. From psychedelic drugs I have a new outlook on many things in the world, and a new appreciation for a lot of things as well. I shared many experiences on different things, and the over all experience from LSD/Acid. 

So now it's your turn Reddit; Have you had any experiences? Do you have any questions? Any advice? Please share anything and everything.

Given the number of us, 5 or so, I figured we'd obviously try and stray away from lying on our backs and listening to trippy music. Don't get me wrong; I absolutely love to do that. But given a recent revelation I had regarding pyschedelics and ""planning"" out my trips (wondering about the ""what ifs"" and ""buts"" about what I should do, shouldn't do, should or shouldn't listen to, watch or shouldn't watch, etc) and how it can basically be whatever you want it to be, I wanted to explore different parts of all there is to feel in the spectrum of LSD.

In this instance, I'm obviously talking about shit you just can't stop laughing about.

So, fellas, what's the funniest thing you've done/thought/said while tripping? Feel free to throw anything out there. I've tripped maybe 20 or so times now and it's always a grand time. 

For me, one of the funniest things was when a friend and I were listening to music in my car while tripping on shrooms actually. My friend suddenly gets out of the car and is borderline freaking me out because he thinks he sees someone and is getting all sketchy because he's afraid of cops or someone calling the cops and etc. He couldn't tell what the persons intentions were or if they were even aware of him or us or whatever and it was really freaking him out. My solution to the problem, if he ever felt the need to alleviate his anxiety by speaking with the person, was to simply say ""I'm just as confused as you are!"". Obviously, saying this would only be appropriate if the person he was spectating actually had any ill intent what so ever as far as getting us in any sort of trouble was concerned. It occurred to me that my friend was probably just bugging and that it was probably just a person going to and from there car from their house to get something, and that a complete stranger in the dark shouting ""I'M JUST AS CONFUSED AS YOU ARE!!!"" at 3AM would probably be a huge ""wtf"" moment for someone who just forgot to bring in left over take out from his car. Needless to say, we were in tears and it surely lightened up the mood for us.

My first trip, I experienced a couple of these occurrences. The first one happened while I was in my friend's backyard and I was looking at the flowers growing on his fence. It was the purplest thing I'd ever seen and I was so completely focused on it that I realized I could actually change it to a red flower and then back to purple. 

The second happened slightly later in the day. I was on the grass looking at this one patch of dirt were there was some dead grass. I put my hand on it because it looked like it was breathing and when I picked my hand back up, I started seeing things in fast motion. I mean, I saw ants running back and forth really fast, grass growing out of the dirt and getting greener before my eyes, and I saw that same grass die and become a regular patch of dirt. It was at that moment that I felt like I had just traveled forward in time and even though I didn't actually see anything significant, I had a lot of incredible revelations because of that experience.

Another example happened on my second trip. I was on this path in the woods and I was tired from walking so I sat down on the ground. I put my hands on the dirt and shut my eyes. I listened to all the sounds around me, the wind, birds, squirrels running around, and I felt like I was able to control the sounds somehow. In my head I was imagining something like a turntable and I could adjust the volume of each individual sound. No clue how long I sat there doing that but at some point it felt like it was too much so I got up and kept walking.

I had only been smoking trees for maybe a month and some friends said they wanted to ""dose"" so I asked what they ment and they said"" You know, drop some acid"". I was a little aprehensive at the though of this, [I had just moved back home from Hawai'i where I had been apart of a mission organization/cult] but I ended up going with. There were 4 of us tripping and one friend just smoking trees and drinking some beer. 

We Droped the Shiva imaged  blotter around 4:30-5:30 in the afternoon in my friends driveway and made our way to the beach. A quick fffffttttt of a bowl and oh how the sun was coming through the trees. So much green! We got to the beach and Lake Michigan had some nice small white caps that day. We began throwing a frisbee around and went for a quick swim. I remember looking around and I started feeling very sluggish, as if I didnt want to move, just sit and enjoy the day. I watched my friends throw the disc back and forth for what felt like Hours. I looked back at the trees on the dunes and they were just swaying in this early summer breeze. It was a beautiful thing really.

I looked at my phone to get a sense of time, seeing as I had never tripped before, and it was 7:40 7:40 Seven:Forty ""Oh Man, why is this number so significant? Oh well""

And that is the last thing I remember being ""normal""

The sun was starting to set and my friends decided to go for a swim but I stayed on the beach seeing as it was a bit chilly. I began to worry about them because the waves looked like they had grown to a massive size, but my buddy who was drinking reassured me they were fine. At this point everything looked orange which was giving me a nice warm vibe. We were all just sitting on the beach as an older couple with a dog walked by. I remember petting the dog and scratching behind its ears and just thinking this was the most badass thing. The couple walked on and as I watched them leave I couldnt help but feeling like I was saying goodbye to a friend.

We left the beach and went back to my friends house, a nice 5-10 minute walk through suburbia along the lakeshore. We made it past his parents saftely to his basement where I thought it would be a good idea to shower. I spent what felt like an hour in the shower turning it from hot to cold because I could not figure out what way was hot and cold. 

Fast forward to my friends wanting to get some beer. I tagged along for a nice car ride to the local Mini Mart. My buddy who was driving and not tripping looked back at us and said ""Ok just get what you need and get out"" So we went in and I looked at everything up and down the isles, picking something up and setting it down when I found something else that I wanted. I think I just got an Arizona or something, maybe some candy I dunno. Got back to the car and my buddy D who was also tripping and I got in the back seat and just started laughing so fucking hard. I mean, I thought I was going to be sick. We noticed some girls in the car next to us saw us laughing and we just kept laughing harder.

We made it back to my friends house safe and sound! Score, this is going suppppper well! 

We ended up smoking some bowls outside and just watching the clouds turn into vampire skulls and halos around the moon, we even saw some deer grazing in the front yard. Everything was awesome. 

My friends thought it would be a good idea to Watch ""Saving Private Ryan"" on the come down, and that was a bummer, but they all passed out and I just turned it off and tried to sleep. No luck.

6Am rolled around and I thought that I should leave, so I got in my car and started to drive away.

As the sun came up and the clouds moved east, I remember feeling like I was again, saying goodbye to a friend. I had braved the Storm. 

I wish I could have that again.

everything started out fine and dandy. i dropped with someone i'm very close with, and everything was wonderful at first. then one of his friends showed up (who had also dropped), and everything went downhill for me from there. i guess it was because i wasn't comfortable around him. he's a nice guy, but i'm kind of introverted and shy, so i felt awkward tripping in his presence.

i started withdrawing myself from my two friends, and began getting lost in my own head. bottom line is, i literally felt my soul leave my body. i was trying to metaphorically grip onto myself, but i felt like i was trying to grasp thin air. as if i was a ghost, and could just put my arm through my body without feeling anything. i tried to cuddle with my friend, but he also felt like a ghost to me. i couldn't hold on to him. imagine cuddling with a hologram when you want nothing more than the comfort of another person's warmth and touch. frustrating and scary as hell.

i felt dead inside. completely empty and emotionless. if i knew what dying felt like, this would be it. i thought i would feel soulless and empty forever, and came to the conclusion that i'd just have to kill myself after my trip because i was ""already dead.""

i also saw my friend turn into a faun-like creature (think ""pan's labyrinth""), and his face morphed into an old man's which looked ice-cold. icicles dripped from his chin, and fog came out of his mouth as if it were freezing cold in the room. his eyes turned into question marks (literally), and in my mind, he was evil and everything he said was a lie. i saw a lot of tortured, screaming faces in the walls and floors, and felt evil entities and just... bad thoughts. 

i cried for days afterwards, feeling completely drained and depressed. was there really nothing inside of me? did my trip just show me that i'm now an empty shell of a person? luckily i was able to freely express the depth of my trip with experienced lsd-using friends of mine, and eventually i went back to normal. i've done acid since, and had an amazing, beautiful trip. i guess i just didn't feel comfortable, which manifested into a living nightmare.

1330446058.0,14,self.LSD,q9tgz,Trip report. Tripped acid for first time yesterday.,18,4,49,http://www.reddit.com/r/LSD/comments/q9tgz/trip_report_tripped_acid_for_first_time_yesterday/,"I was doing some live updating yesterday but I decided to do a trip report after I've tripped my balls off.

Man, what can I say. The first hit slowly kicked in throughout the day. It was verrry easy for me to zone out and just stare. Driving around was fun. Went to the park and through a frisbee around for a little bit, that was amazing. There was a lot going on at the park and I felt like I could understand all of it at the same time. Nature was great.

I went back to my friends house for a little bit, and waited for his mom to make dinner. That was crazy, I met like his whole family while tripping. But it was more funny than anything, everything was making me laugh. My peak began after we ate in his car and began to drive around. We were listening to The Dark Side of The Moon by The Flaming Lips and it was absolutely wonderful. I cried a little bit and was feeling really amazing energies. I remember passing 2 churches with signs out front that said ""It only gets better"" and ""be kind, be wise, and be humble"". Seeing those made me feel really good about life and the trip, and it excited me for the next hit I was planning on taking...

When we got back to my place is when everything changed. For a few hours before I had this odd feeling in my head, like a headache with no pain. I ignored it, thinking it was no big deal. I think I may have smoked a little too much weed during my trip, (smoked almost a gram withing a few hours) which I didnt think would be a big deal. I took my second hit and just sat in my room with music playing. I felt like.. nothing. Didn't want to move, and couldn't really talk, just sitting and staring.

My headache was getting so much worse so I took a shower, didn't work. I went to meditate thinking that would help but it was so strange, it was easier for me to meditate than any other time I've tried. I felt like I was always about to ""go somewhere"" in my mind but I never did, only almost if that makes sense. My breathing was holding me back, like I would be going further and further and then forget I had to breathe, and it would reset all over again when I took a breath.

I feel like I a wasted a hit, probably smoked too much weed, and that headache was killer, but all in all I still had a great time. Just upset I couldn't go further. I had mild visuals, but it was not as intense as shrooms ever was. I saw a couple ""waves"" in reality and colors were slightly better but that was it.

Anyway sorry if this was long. I'm going for a run and then I'm gonna try to meditate. I would like to thank all you for helping me out yesterday, you have no idea how great that was. And advice or info as to why my trip was the way it was would be awesome, thanks guys!

1317952667.0,15,self.LSD,l3oir,My Adventure to the Beyond and Back,16,1,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/LSD/comments/l3oir/my_adventure_to_the_beyond_and_back/,"To preface this, this is not meant to be a bad-trip story, although parts of it were both the most terrifying and most exhilarating experiences I have ever had, but rather a story of too much acid, the importance of friends, and how this experience has changed me.  This is actually the first time I have put this story into words, and this seemed an appropriate place to share it.  Be warned it is rather long and even then still misses parts that I can either not verbalize and/or remember correctly.  For those that stick around thanks for reading.

I had dropped acid twice before, and both had been fairly good experiences (My favorite of these: seeing the sunrise over a large river on a bridge in the city and then watching the world slowly wake up from the vantage point of a public park).  The first time I took 1 tab, and the second time we knew it was a bit weaker so I took 3 and both of these instances were with two close friends, let’s call them Fred and George.

This time we had gotten it from a new source.  We planned to take it a Fred and George’s apartment, and as we had taken it before we decided to take 2.5 tabs each (Fred and George actually took 3 as they had more experience/tolerance with the stuff).  After taking it we started to feel the effects a little sooner than we expected.  We took turns taking showers (a must when taking acid I feel).
By the time it was my turn I was feeling the acid very strongly.  The shower they had was amazing, a carved stone cave.  I became immersed in this new water world, which was comforting, warm, and embracing.  And although part of my mind still recognized that there was a world outside, there was another part that said this wonderful water world was more real.  My thought recursed inwards again and again, as the enclosed shower became almost a sensory deprivation box where all that existed were my thoughts.  After hours (read 15 mins) I worked up the courage to leave this world behind, and reenter the world of other minds.  Putting on my clothes was very difficult.  When I exited I found that my friends were feeling it very strongly as well.

This is where my memory starts to become a little hazy.  But suffice to say it soon became clear that it was affecting me much more than everyone else and even they were caught off guard by how strong the acid was, saying we should not have taken so much.  These are the things that stand out most in my mind.  First I was not comfortable staying in once place.  They lived in a two floor apartment and at one point I remember continually climbing up stairs looking for them as if there were continuous floors of their apartment stretching upward and upward.  I became anxious when one of them was not present, hence the searching, and was not entirely convinced that they existed if they were not present.  

This folds into the next idea that became lodged in my head.  Taken from the mindset from when I was the lone mind in the water world, I became convinced that Fred and George were not actually separate minds, but aspects of my own personality.  I was only content when Fred and George and I were all in the same room, making us whole.  

This is where reality really started breaking down for me.  It was not an external break down, as in seeing things, but an internal one where I had many existential questions that maybe always had been there buried beneath the surface.  For example, I came to realize the absurdity reality and of my existence.  I wake up, go to classes, eat, do some activities, go to sleep, and repeat.  This was taken for granted as normal, but the acid, more than anything else it did, was breaking down the things I took for granted and never truly thought about.  I took for granted that my sense took in accurate representations of the reality of existence, and took for granted the arbitrary structure that I had applied upon the aggregation of these senses.  I wake up, do some stuff, fall asleep, and that is all there is and all there will be until I do not wake up.  Sure I find pleasure in the things I do, but that seemed a frail basis to hold this meaningless parade of actions together.  And more than anything else ever has this terrified me.


The next hours were a blur; I remember moving to another house, and some other vague things.  The next cogent moment I was in Fred and George’s apartment.  I felt a bit strange and was a little confused and at first felt that I had just woken up at their house where I had slept for some reason.  And I had had all these strange dreams, being confused in a stranger house, being in a grocery store, interacting with strange people.

My friends fill me in on details and slowly I learn that these dreams were not dreams, but the things I had done in my blurred out reality while on acid.  I truly feel like I was in a state of dream level consciousness over this period.  Most of it involved me acting strangely and continually moving around and not knowing what to do.  The most embarrassing thing that happened is I tried to open a frozen meal right there in the super market and had to be ushered out by my friends before I caused a scene.

This is where I have to say how awesome my friends were.  Even though Fred and George were also both tripping hard, they realized that I was nonfunctional and having a bad time of it.  The seemingly direness of my situation sobered them a little I think and they made sure to guide and take care of me.  They were worried for me, and Fred later said that he thought my mind had broken.
As I was coming back down into reality we went back to my place to end this adventure of a day by watching Mad Max.

Although parts were terrifying, there were also parts that were beautiful and indescribable.  So I would not take away from this that you should not take acid, but that if you do make sure that you are 1. Aware of how strong it is, and more importantly 2. Be with people that you truly trust.

I have since taken a half tab of acid, for fear of returning to the same state, but also interested to see If I could take a small dose and be fine.  As I have heard elsewhere, it seems as if the gates to hell had already been opened by my previous journey and appear as if they may remain open forever.  The amount was small but I felt myself returning to that state of existential angst.  I was able to consciously pull myself out of it, after a long harrowing period of time(read 20 mins).  In this period I made many notes to myself never to take acid again.  After I came mostly down from the small dose I actually watched Being John Malcovich for the first time with a roommate, which needless to say was a very interesting time to watch that movie.

TLDR: So the long and short of it; I accidentally took too much acid, had experiences both amazing and existentially terrifying,  but with a little help from my friends got through it, and the experience is one I certainly do not regret now. (I am actually studying currently for my PhD in a cognitive science related field).

July 13th was my fourth time dropping acid. The three times before would have never prepared me for what I was about to experience that night.

My first time dropping was in April. I had bought three tabs of 200ug/tab ""white"" acid from my friend, who purchased a batch from Tesselated on the SR. I dropped one tab, had a great time and EXCELLENT visuals, but since it was my first time and I was alone, I slowly segued into a bit of a bad trip which my brother helped me out of. It was good overall.

My second time was four days after that, dropping the last two tabs I had along with the friend who sold them to me, who took two as well. I dropped 400ug total, and it was an excellent trip, a great night.

A while after that my friend bought a batch of 150ug/tab ""yellow"" Gandalf acid from jerseycow on the SR. I bought two tabs and decided to drop with my girlfriend near the end of June, one tab for each of us. I thought jerseycow's acid would provide the same effects as Tesselated's acid (albeit lighter because of the lower dosage, and this would be my lowest dose yet), but I was very wrong. We had a great time when it hit, we were both totally relaxed and happy- but when I peaked I start feeling really hot, my heart rate jumped, I started sweating beads, I vomited everything out of my system and emptied my bowels. I felt as if my body was being wringed and it was a horrible, nightmarish trip but I slowly got out of it and was able to walk outside and have a great time after I relaxed and had some water. Although this was my girlfriend's first time ever dropping, she didn't have any nausea, and even though the guy who gave her the acid was vomiting from ingesting it, she didn't even trip bad... I just thought of it as a singular bad experience, an outlier, probably a result of something I ate before I trippped, or just a result of anxiety (girlfriend and all) or dehydration since the day was very hot.

A couple weeks pass and my friend only has 4 tabs left. He proposes that I spend the night at his place and drop two tabs along with him. Since I was able to handle 400ug before and because I felt as if I could definitely handle myself now after learning from the bad experience I had with my girlfriend, I went ahead with it. We ingest 300ug each at 10:29pm-I let the tabs sit in my mouth for a good minute and I could taste the slight bitterness which was most likely the ink. We go outside to smoke a joint and went back inside and to watch some TV, and I could feel the tingling in my teeth as the trip was starting to set in. Bleach was on and the atmosphere of the room was changing along with the show; it was so damn cool. His floor was shifting and the time dilation set in. He was sitting on a couch adjacent to me and looked like he was having a great time himself.

We got up and he told me that we had to go outside at least one point during the trip. I wholeheartedly agreed (in my head, for I found it was quite difficult to speak). I stood up and his floor started flashing. The time dilation REALLY hit me now. It was almost 12:00 and walking over to his door felt like it took longer than it should have. He opened the door and everything became very real for a second. The heat of the warm night emanated through the door and I felt very based and able for a good couple seconds. We both breathed some fresh air on his porch and he said we should go out through the back. He had to get his keys and I needed to get my phone and wallet before we did so, however. We both started walking back and forth, and I could tell that he was having a bit of trouble figuring out where things were. I myself had total short term memory loss at that point. I could not remember why I got up, I could not remember where were going, how much time had passed, and I kept asking the same questions over and over again. This was definitely because of the weed. He was having massive difficulty communicating with me due to the ambiguous nature of my questions combined with his current high. I finally got a bit of a grasp of what was going on and was able to go outside, into his back yard along with him. I remember it being VERY hot and quite dark. I was wearing a tank top and pajama pants over boxer briefs. It was around 80 fahrenheit (27 celsius) outside. He had a jungle gym and I just climbed up the jungle gym, sat on a platform, and tried to cool myself down. I went down the slide and sat on a swing next to him, feeling very nauseous. The short term memory loss proceeded to hit me VERY hard again and this time the visuals went crazy. Everything shrunk and expanded rapidly and there were fractals EVERYWHERE and I had trouble remembering who my friend was. He approached me and with an oscillating voice said ""Yeah, I think we better go back inside"", realizing that I was not feeling too great. We go back in, and I walk to his living room. I sit down on his couch and I can't bring myself to watch TV because it was TOO hot. I stood up and took my pajama pants off. He freaked out a bit and I started walking back and forth through his living room, trying to understand what was going on. The room was expanding and flashing and I was hearing voices and my teeth felt like they were going to break, my skin felt as if there were millions of burning worms underneath it. I was sweating beads like I did when I dropped with my girlfriend. I don't know what's going on, who I am, where I am; I kept forgetting every passing second. It was around 1AM at this point. I run to his bathroom and throw up; it literally looked to me like I vomited black stuff EVERYWHERE, and I had only eaten three Oreos and half a bottle of water since I got to his place... I distinctly recall seeing the two tabs I dropped among bits and chunks of Oreos in his sink. At this point I am freaking out, and he is freaking out. I am in such pain and there are colors and fractals everywhere, I vomit more and more and spew everything out of my system, all over his sink and toilet and partially on his floor.

Then, total ego death.

I felt as if I was being born again. I had no sense of self, and I was disassociated to the point where I felt as if I was part of my environment. Every time I tried forming sentences or coherent expressions I was pulled back into a mesh of unwoven thoughts and feelings. Pain and paranoia were the only things that were apparent; I was reduced to purely primordial instincts and thoughts. I only knew that I was alive and I needed to stay alive, and I could remember my friend as if he was someone I knew in a past life. He is close to tripping bad and calls a couple of his friends over to help us out- sitting in the bathroom in my tank top and boxers, delirious among the black vomit which surrounded me, I try latching onto his conversation in an attempt to hold onto reality; for the white tiles on the floor and all auditory stimuli were being blended together into an amalgam of beautiful yet terrifying kaleidoscopic cornucopia of fractals.

*That was the longest fucking phone call in history*.

When they finally come over I am lying on his dining room floor, trying to relax and ease myself. Hearing them enter, I thought there were at least thirty people in the house, including my father. They try speaking to me, and I have difficulty reciprocating. I kept asking the same questions, and I was reduced to a childlike state of fear and unknowing. I wanted to know what we were doing, I asked over and over again- and they assured me that they're just cleaning things up and I have to calm down and drink water. I thought they were speaking a different language. I lied back down and my body was wringed out over and over again for what seemed like months. I get back up after what was actually close to half an hour and empty my bowels in the now-clean bathroom. I get somewhat cleaned up and I go into my friend's air-conditioned room, turn the lights off, turned his star-projector on, lied down, put my headphones in, and resigned myself to the sounds of Seven Lions. I tripped through space and time, thought and experience for years as I recollected who I was and everything I had experienced in my life up until that point. A couple hours pass, it's 4AM now, and I come back out, still feeling a bit nauseous with some mad tracers/visuals but overall feeling A LOT better than before. Everything was good from that point on, although I was a bit shaken from the experience.

My friend is 6' tall (183cm) and weighs around 140lbs (63.5kg). My girlfriend is 5'11"" (180cm) and weighs 117lbs (53kg). I am 5'4"" (163cm) and 107lbs (48.5kg). Another friend of mine who is 5'7"" (170cm) and 160lbs (72.5kg) had a great experience on the same acid, as well as numerous others who bought tabs from my friend. My friend himself was also able to drop three Gandalfs (450ug) and still had a great time. I suspect that my adverse reactions to the acid and the contrasting pleasant experiences of my friend, girlfriend, et al. may have been a result of differing body weights. I am very, very skinny and have close to 7 pounds (3.2kg) of fat in my body, as well as a BMI of 18. Would this be the cause of my previous experiences? Or, if anyone here is familiar with jerseycow's product (which I'm sure many are) would the nausea, sweating, vomiting, dehydration etc. be because of any certain chemical within the product or is it purely due to the circumstances I was in?

I have a couple questions. Hoping for some insight. A group of 4 of us are going for an LSD trip in June. 2 of us (my boyfriend and I) have had very trriiipppy trips before (I've experienced LSD about 4 times before...and my bf even more...we never knew what the doses were though). 

My sister (Sue) has tried it twice with us but it wasn't very strong and my other sister (Karry) pretty much never tried it before.

We have 150ug blotters. I need to know how much you think each of us should be taking? 

My bf and I, due to experience, should maybe take 2 or 3? Or how many? 

My sister (Sue), should take 2? Or 1? 

And my inexperienced sister (Karry) should take 1 or...? (she has a paranoid, anxious personality, suffers with panic attacks etc...people with anxiety issues have told me that LSD has always been a great experience when done under the right settings etc. so we're not too worried about her anxiety troubles - we have a really beautiful plan/setting prepared, but we still want to be cautious)...more info on Karry: She doesn't like the way weed makes her feel. Says it amplifies her anxiety/panic attacks...so if she ever smokes, she only takes a few pulls. She is fine with Alcohol. Has no experience with other substances. 

I don't want my sisters to have a lesser experience. I would love for us all to be on the same level more or less and to have the time of our lives...but how do we figure out the right doses for each of us? 

Can you take one now and then if it's not strong enough, take another a couple hours later? How would that work?

Any advice would be sooo appreciated! Thanks guys! 

P.S. No real names were used. :P

EDIT:
Oh yes! **One more question.** My bf and I bought extra so we were wondering...it's been 2 years since we had any...and we want the trip in June to be special. Though we were thinking of trying half or 1 hit each in the coming weekend...would it build our resistance up and require us to take more in the June trip than we would have if we just waited til June? Is it advisable to take LSD a few weeks apart? What do you think?

I saw things that I would not typically see whilst sober and I'm so very thankful for this. I got to thinking, as one does on a trip, and thought about you know the ultimate question of what the hell is the point of life. And well at first I started thinking about the things one does in life, the pleasures the adventures. And you know what, I was a little scared at first to think that that was life, just us fulfilling our desires. Too many of us have become bogged down by the bombardment of distractions. **DEAD END PLEASURES** that have ill benefits to the success of the human species. Too many well off people spend their lives enslaved to society, merely doing work they do not enjoy in order to obtain things they do not need.
There must be more! Yes there is more, life is not about us humans pursuing our desires rather it is about the struggle to OVERCOME our desires to SEE that our desires are petty in the grand scheme. I don't know about you but I am pretty thankful that I'm alive and kicking in this chemistry experiment of life. That I have a spirit that extends beyond my worldly body. Taking psychedelics has helped me realize how misguided so many souls are, how there are TOO many out there chasing their desires. Granted not everyone has the luxury to ingest LSD but it is because of the desires of Man that this is so. Psychedelics are all around us in this natural world and I believe that is what makes us different than animals but we have departed from the gift, the gift that nature has provided for our souls. I believe when you are on psychedelics you are no longer bound by the limits of your body but you are FREE to understand the nature of our existence.
After taking LSD I see that hate and greed cannot work, it cannot work in this evolution of life. We are **ALL** from the same gasses that formed this planet, and it is our duty to continue on this wonder called life!
We are a magnificent step in the evolutionary ladder, yet we must continue forward. Life has not come this far by repeating the same endeavors. That is why we are so magnificent, we were created to explore and express this natural world and our spiritual energy. We are at the forefront of life as we know it. It is in our very nature to move forward, to change, to be radical because the very idea of life itself is radical. We must not be by-products of life, existing only to **CONSUME**.

1346903129.0,12,self.LSD,zfkpv,A Fascinating Trip,14,2,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/LSD/comments/zfkpv/a_fascinating_trip/,"I bought two tabs of sunshine LSD on Monday and went to my best friend J's apartment to trip with him. My other friend A was there as well. I planned on taking 1 and a half tabs while J took a half (it was his first trip and he's usually a light weight on any drug so it seemed fitting). We dropped them at about 7:30 that night and we started to really feel the effects at around 8:30. A never really considered taking LSD until I was offered a good deal on two more tabs for $5 each, which I gladly purchased. They were even delivered to us since we were already tripping and didn't wanna leave. So A took a half a tab while I took the other half and saved the last tab for another time, even though I was wondering how hard I'd trip if I took that much acid. I'm glad I didn't take it because I was wide awake til 11 the next morning. So at this point, I'm tripping hard on two tabs. We start watching ""The Sitter"" which was amazing because it was such a random and funny movie. The colours were changing a lot and Jonah Hill's fat, goofy face looked really sinister and trippy. It was a pretty mindblowing movie to watch on acid. The screen was moving a lot as well, kind of like how ""The Office"" is filmed. After that we watched ""American Reunion"", which made us horny as fuck. It ended up being one of my favourite movies because I love how everyone was all grown up but still immature and funny. The film also had a good plot for being an American Pie movie. It had a good moral to it. 

Later, we started watching trippy videos on YouTube that absolutely blew our minds. It was so exciting to see random, trippy gifs, music, and art compiled into these videos. We were laughing and freaking out the whole time, and one video had a creepy looking girl pop out at the end which scared the fuck out of us and I screamed ""Fuck the asshole that made this video!"" but we ended up laughing anyway. I was relieved that it didn't ruin my trip. 

After about a half hour of trippy videos, J wanted to watch the Sitter again with his friend V that came to the apartment later that night. A and I thought that was a waste of trip time so we went outside to explore nature and gaze at the night sky. We couldn't stop talking about how fascinating life, the world, mankind and the universe is. Laying down in the grass staring up at the stars was a sight like I've never seen before. My mind was so blown that I had to remind myself to blink because I couldn't pull myself away from the sky's beauty. It looked like there were thousands of stars dancing, twinkling, and changing colours. Airplanes flying by looked like shooting stars. Looking back down at the grass was amazing too because the texture of it looked so fancy and surreal. There was a bridge nearby where I could see lots of car lights flashing by and leaving behind tremors. The lake was also magnificent. I realized that the outdoors is where I should have spent most of my trip. I could describe it as being an alien visiting Earth for the first time. A was also fascinated by it all and he's never been much of a nature person as far as I know, but I'm sure he is now. LSD really awakens an appreciation of nature, art, and music. That trip helped me remember that the world is an awesome place and that I want to experience it as long as possible. This trip also helped me decide more on what I want to do for a living. I want to do something that will show people my visions, such as architecture or engineering. I never was much of a good friend with A until we wandered through the night and had these deep conversations. LSD really helps people connect. 

A and I were pretty frustrated that J didn't want to come walk with us because he was missing out on so much. But maybe someday he will trip again and realize how much he was missing out on instead of watching the same movie twice in one night. A left at about 3 that morning and had school in a few hours so I wonder how that turned out for him. I feel like being in a setting like that would be make me anxious or scared but A didn't seem to consider anything bad happening. He saw acid as the greatest thing in the world when I was talking to him, not really considering the possibility of the trip going bad. 

Later that night, J went to bed and A went home with V so I was left alone by myself. I wanted to sleep but there was no way I could. I was having full on CEVs of things I can't even describe. It just looked like abstract art in my head. I tossed and turned on the couch with ""Polar Express"" playing while I was listening to some electronic music. I ended up watching the ceiling fan because it looked really cool. I also looked at the balcony door with windows on it which had a curtain hanging over it. The lights shining through the curtain were changing colours and the curtain looked like it was breathing. It was really dark in the living room though so it had an eerie feel to it. My mind was racing and I felt like I was losing my mind. Being alone while you're tripping in the dark isn't much fun but time was moving very quickly. 

Before I knew it, it was 6 AM and I sat outside for a little while. Everyone in the apartment complex was heading out for school, work, or wherever else. I went out to my car to sit and listen to the radio for a while. Some Ed Sheeran was playing which relaxed me a bit as I looked out of the frosted windshield. Fractal looking lights and drops of water were covered all over it. It was a pretty beautiful morning. The trip was really settling down, or so I thought. I felt fit to drive so I head for Walmart/McDonald's to get a frappe. My perception was a bit off and lights still looked pretty bright but I just took things slow and paid super close attention to the cars in front of me. 

Walking around WalMart was pretty weird. Everything felt off. Kind of like living in the Matrix. I looked at all these people going about their everyday lives and thought about how crazy it was that I was probably the only person in the store tripping on acid. I even felt like people were talking to me, even though they didn't really have a reason to. Anyway, I just looked at a couple of posters and games and headed home. After I got home, I looked at my phone to see that letters and numbers were still pretty wavy. I felt badass that I made it home in that state of mind, but next time I'm avoiding driving until I know for sure that I'm sober. I wouldn't recommend driving on acid. I pet my dogs for a bit and took some melatonin to fall asleep faster since I was still wired but fried. I took a three hour nap and woke up feeling kind of rested, then I made a sandwich since I hadn't eaten in almost 24 hours. My trip was pretty much over at that point, which I was glad because I really just wanted to eat and sleep at this point, as beautiful as all the visuals were. 

So there you have it, r/LSD. Sorry if I wrote too much or my trip wasn't interesting enough but I felt like I had to write down this experience while it's still fresh in my mind.

I've heard people say that they are in control on LSD. When one says that..exactly how much control? 

Can you stop yourself from seeing things? 

What type of things do you see? I want to drop half a tab. 

Is there any possibility of not seeing things on LSD?

Is there a body high as well? For example, do you feel like you are sinking into the Earth? Rooted to the ground? 

How fast is the come up? Will I go from sober, to feeling some affects to full blown tripping?

I can certainly consider the day to be a journey. I took what was recommended as a small dose for my body weight (100ug) and was only thinking that this would serve as an initial experience to prepare me for future, deeper trips. However, I feel like I was in enough of an altered mindset that I could have done some more productive thinking. 

I feel like I was too easily distracted when trying to think about problems in my life, or ideologies that I wanted to meditate on. My mind was too eager to spend time simply observing objects around me. While this was very interesting and amusing, I want to use these trips as less of a fun recreation and more as a time for self-reflection and thinking. I also am having trouble remember the things I did think about and while I could have written more down during the trip, I don't know how capable I would have been at doing this anyways.

Any tips for my next trip? 

Also, how long should I wait before taking another trip?

At times, being the most beautiful experience of my life and at others the most terrifying. 

Highlights included watching a small red-berried tree change colours in time to the music whilst the sun was setting in the background. The carpet was incredibly fascinating. It would twist and march in time to MGMT's Oracular Spectacular which just blew me away. The whole album seemed to be made for an LSD trip. 

Some of the worst bits of my trip included the realisation of the futility of life, dying a thousand deaths and coming back from madness. Finding myself in worlds within worlds, the loss of time really messed with me. I knew that when my clock said 1700-1800 I'd probably start coming down but the numbers were truly meaning less. I would also find myself trapped in time where the configuration of  my body (e.g breathing in/out) seemed to stop and freeze. I'd really have to try hard to snap out of that. 

Anyway the point of my post is really to talk about my feelings after the trip and see if anyone can relate. I have been through today with real depression weighing me down, no real appetite and the general feeling of being lost. I've talked with my trip buddy who took about the same as me and he told me about not really understanding what others were saying to him.

As a child, I cried and fought against the doctor when it came time for booster shots.  A few years ago I completely freaked out when I had to go to the hospital for food poisoning and they put an IV in my arm, and when I tried to give blood in college, I passed out as soon as I saw the needle go into my arm.

Now with that said, I took my first LSD trip 2 weeks ago.  It was excellent.  But they day after, I was in the kitchen and my mom was giving our old diabetic pet schnauzer an insulin shot.  Now normally, I don't even like to be in the room when she does this, but for some reason, I was fine.  It felt almost like I forgot how to be freaked out.  It was a very weird feeling.  To make sure that I wasn't freaked out, I picked up the syringe, took the top off and looked at it plainly.  Still no freak out.  Just to make sure, I volunteered to give our dog the insulin shot.  After getting a few instructions from my mom (obviously I've never given a shot before), I calmly leaned over my dog and injected the insulin into the back of her neck.

This is one of the strangest tricks my brain has ever pulled on me.  I almost couldn't believe it.  It's been a little over 2 weeks now, and things have changed a little.  I still do not like needles, but when I think about the experience of giving my dog an insulin shot, the ""freak out!"" sort of feeling I used to have is replaced by a methodical sort of calmness.  I don't understand it.

Now, I would consider myself more knowledgeable on the subject of brain chemistry and psychology than the average person, as I took some psychology classes in college and my bachelor's is in chemistry.  But nothing that I know or have ever heard of can explain this.  I could understand if someone had slight changes in mood or anxiety levels immediately after taking LSD.  I mean, I did heavily alter my brain chemistry with synthetic drugs.  But its been over 2 weeks now, and frankly, my anxiety towards needles is %99 gone.  I am cured.

What the fuck has happened to me!?  Are there anybody here with a PHD in neuroscience that can explain this to me?  Has anyone else had a similar experience after taking LSD and would like to share?

SIDE-NOTE:  I am also a huge pothead, I was smoking everyday.  But immediately after the LSD, I just didn't feel like getting high.  I didn't smoke for about 36 hours after taking LSD.  I just didn't feel like it.  That's really the best way I can explain it.

I used to think of myself as someone who has really strong visions, but after reading that post I think the reasons my dreams are so crazy but I can never really remember what they ""looked like"" or how I get from scene to scene is because a lot of what I sense as ""vivid *looking*"" is actually ""vivid *ideas.*"" A dream is basically when you're given an experience of sensing a huge amount of mental imagery that involuntarily elicit other mental imagery. When you have ""crazy dreams"" they're probably actually low-res, because the ""crazy"" part isn't what you see: it's the experience of jumping from idea to idea. 

When you trip on lsd you also experience sensations eliciting other sensations, and memories, and ideas. Like in a dream, these connections are involuntary-- you jump from one to another against your will (hence 'looping'). However, like in a *lucid* dream, you're aware of what's going on and you get to basically control your immediate actions (although you can't really plan what will come after that) and you get to have *some* influence on the story. But it really feels like being in a dream-- your brain goes into the same mode when you're dreaming, where you subconsiously know that you're the only person here really experiencing it. In a dream you take eveything that happens to be part of some overarching story about you, because even in a non-lucid dream part of you knows that it really is all about you. 

When you trip on LSD your brain goes into dream mode and partly thinks you're in REM (the lightest phase of sleep), even though your brain is still in the state of being awake, and the parts of your brain that are awake are not turned off. So you have the juxtaposition between the senses that always come with being awake mixed with the sensation that you're in dreamland and, wait, everyone else is experiencing this world too?!

I'm fairly experienced with LSD and thought I'd share my opinion on the differences (and hope to hear yours!)

I took a 1.2mg tab, the friend I was with took 1.5 of them. We dropped at about 4:30pm.

I would equate it with one hit of good acid.

I found the come-up quite pleasant, I felt a sort of giggly, nervous energy, but it wasn't uncomfortable like acid can be. For me with acid sometimes I have trouble making the transition into the acid head-space.

I didn't really feel like there was a definite peak, it just slowly got stronger, and then slowly went away.

Visually, it didn't seem as clear. I had nice tracers and everything was sort of blurry, and colours were nicely intense, but I didn't get much breathing or swirling like I would with acid.

My friend, who had 1.5 tabs, had much stronger visuals.

Mentally my head was quite clear. I felt silly and happy but not crazy like acid can be.

My friend and I listened to music and we noted how we could really get into it and listen to all the different parts but weren't emotionally overwhelmed. We could listen to jarring or discordant music without feeling overly identified with it.

I think LSD is much more euphoric.

""Spiritually"" LSD is superior, NBOMe is not particularly introspective and while conversation was a little silly and lots of fun it definitely didn't get deep and meaningful (although perhaps it could if I was previously in a different mind-set).

Also I seemed to come down quite suddenly - within about 30 minutes the visuals went from fairly strong to almost nothing. With LSD I'd still be seeing breathing/swirling for ages. Which can be good or bad.

As I came down I noticed body tension and jaw clenching, like I'd experience coming down from MDMA.

Although I'd planned to sleep at my friend's place I drove the 10 minutes home - which I'd never consider after LSD. [I don't recommend this, I probably shouldn't have but there was very little traffic and I felt safe and drove carefully].

I got to sleep fairly easily on only .5mg xanax. On acid for me that's almost impossible, I'd need at least 1mg.

Overall I think I much prefer LSD, but my opinion of NBOMe is now pretty good. There are times when I might prefer NBOMe over LSD.

I'd love to hear opinions and comparisons on NBOMe from other LSDditors.",,False,,t5_2qhvj,False,,,True,t3_1isst1,http://www.reddit.com/r/LSD/comments/1isst1/lsd_vs_nbome/,

The reason I'm making this post is to let people know about my experience of dosing while taking noopept a potent nootropic. Recently when I've been dosing I've been getting a good body high, but not much visuals besides slight wall bending in the corners n such, not much at all compared to when I had first started taking lsd. A little more than 2 weeks ago I took 3 tabs and experienced a mild body high and very, very little visuals, open eyed and closed. So I ordered 5 mg of noopept after reading reviews online and others experiences.

So I ordered some noopept from a site. I started taking about 10-20mg of it daily about 5 days before I planned on tripping. After about 3 days on just noopept, I noticed an increase in perception, etc as many said they do on the potent nootropic. On the day I dosed, I took my morning helping of noopept, went to work, and came home and had dinner. After dinner I took about 10-20mg more of noopept about an hour prior to dosing. At about 10 pm I popped 4 tabs of ""meh"" quality tabs (stuff I had laid myself at about 50-80 mics each). 

After about 15 minutes, I started to feel myself come up. Within 45 minutes I was tripping harder than I ever had even off of 6+ tabs. I really had no idea when I truly peaked. I had water vision and wall breathing for about 7 hours straight. Didn't experienced too much waviness (of the trip) as I had when I previously had tripped. My motor skills went to shit, I realized,  when it took me about 2 hours of watching AD and Alice in W. to roll a single dutch into a blunt. There were times where I was at the point of crying from laughter from the smallest things, and an amazing overall perception of the world as it is, and the nature of humans and nature itself.

Overall, I recommend mixing noopept (small dosage) with LSD for those who really can handle their cid well, and are looking for a powerful trip. If I had been less experienced I feel as though I may have been overwhelmed by the hard come up. The visuals I got were the best Ive ever had. After watching a few shows/bits of movies, I laid in bed and had the best CEV for about 2 hours while listening to music. From what I understand, the noopept allowed the receptors in my brain to be flooded with the lsd.

My brain's still a little all over the place from last night, so please let me know if I can clarify anything (I imagine some of my thoughts seem very jumbled).

7:30AM-ate my sugar cube on an empty stomach and played battlefield 2 and Arcade Fire's funeral album waiting for the come up.

7:45-7:50ish- i noticed something was different but couldnt figure it out. colors were a bit enhanced and felt a bit nauseous. 

around 8:15- the game was getting harder to play and the music was becoming incredible. 

8:30ish- i played with my dog outside and had tracers. when i threw the tennis ball, i saw a trail of neon yellow through the air. my back yard had a bunch of colorful roses and flowers and was amazing. also the sky was like a blue and violet mix.

i lost track of time here, but remember what happened.  things started to pick up pretty quickly. the cement in the brick walls started to flow in the bricks and everything looked super 3d. walls were breathing inside. i laid down on the ground and my dog came up and licked my face and i started cracking up. his face was hilarious. my friend and i always joke about how he kinda looks human, well on acid, he looks human x10. i watched his curly tail get curlier. 

i kept getting into thought loops and everything seemed to happen frame by frame. thankfully, i wrote, ""youre okay :)"" on my hand and it helped me a ton. as i looked at it though, the ink would stretch on my hand and my fingers looked crazy.

I then walk down my street to my friends house because i was taking care of his dogs for the weekend. The walk down was magnificent. i watched people's driveways flow and form waves like at the end of the acid scene in that woodstock movie. flowers seemed to explode and i couldnt stop smiling.

once i get in his house, he had a trippy ass table cloth. i watched the patterns raise off of it then go back on to it. i zoned out into it and forgot what i was thinking about. then my trip sitter knocked on the door and freaked me out. this is where things got even more amped up.

He was going to smoke weed and i really missed when i was able to but cant due to drug testing. so i was clean for 2.5 months. i realized i had a four day weekend and could most likely get clean by the end of it so i said why not.

I take a 1 mid sized rip, and thats all i needed. I held it in, looked up in the sky and it just exploded and was amazing. the clouds seemed to get lower and lower until the point where i sank into my chair to not be taken into it. when i exhaled, everything melting together. it was mind blowing. his house melted into the trees and had the branches curl into it.

i wanted to go inside but stay outside, so i sat in the middle of the doorway. that was so crazy. if you havent done it, i recommend it. you can feel the different atmospheres. the inside and outside felt like they were pushing together. the inside seemed peaceful and introspective while the outside was lively and adventurous. we went inside for a while.

from here, im positive im at my peak. everything seemed really candylike. his outside brim of hiis closet looked like the airhead xtreme cany strips flowing around. all his furniture was bright and looked kinda like carmel, but melted into the ceiling. i saw patterns on the ceiling. i cannot describe those. 

i went to the bathroom and looked in the mirror.  that was incredible and is where i learned about alot about myself. you can take 2 paths going in there. the happy path, where you learn the positives about yourself, and the bad path, where you learn flaws about yourself. i took both at different times and found lessons that i wanna keep private. also watching your face morph and change was sick. we watched a bunch of cartoons like danny phantom, adventure time, sesame street etc and that all seems to be made for acid. it was perfect.

i went home around 2pm and put my music on shuffle while i watched tv. i didnt know how to change the channel and that show general hospital was on. the lyrics in the music fit perfect with the mouths moving and was hilarious. 

after that, i was coming down and played xbox. i still felt energized and colors were still vibrant but no more flowing patterns melting visuals. 

i still have the color enhancement which i think is sick and 10 out of 10 would do again.

It was amazing LSD and I had a really good time, super mellow and calm and nice.

Next day after I take it, I see the dude again, and he claims that the night previous he spilt the bottle of LSD on his hand by accident and was tripping on 'at least 50 tabs'. He was coherent and fine, he just looked really pissed off. He claimed he was 'tripping hard' but he was able to walk, speak - pretty much he interacted completely normally, just with a really pissed off vibe. He also claimed that at first when it spilt on his hand, he panicked, but he also told another friend that he ""took another tab because it wasn't kicking in"". Cue massive eye roll on my part.

Oh and also, on the evening we dropped the LSD he sold us, he called my Boyfriend at 3am and was claiming to be 'Too high off the spill' but he was able to use his phone, have a coherent conversation, AND several people told us he was walking around town completely normally, but claiming he was tripping and, in the words of my friend, 'just all round feeling sorry for himself'.

My question is, would you be able to be this normal after spilling an entire bottle on your hand? He has a history of being a massive liar and I have a feeling that this is another one of those times. It's really frustrating because he's getting a lot of pity from a few people but I feel like he's just saying this for attention. Also, he has a history of hard drug use and there was a period of time where he was dropping LSD and MDMA at least once a week for 6 weeks. He's just an idiot, really.

Also, I'd say the stuff was really potent because I took the equivalent of two tabs and I was absolutely tripping balls, sometimes to the point where I couldn't walk properly haha. So I just don't understand how he could be so normal after 50????

UPDATE: We tripped the fuck out on Friday, here is a recount of our stories.

The come-up, we left my mates house at around 9.40pm, started heading towards the shops, lit a blunt and passed it round, dropped right after, 20 minutes passes, we all feel fucking spectacular, get to the shops as we start tripping, Robbie and I can not even face the shops we are laughing so hard, Ryder walks in and comes back out with asshole tasting gatorade, we proceed to walk about as we start peaking, I realise and I'm like, fuck, we need to be somewhere.

We begin the long trek back to Ryder's house, on the way back we're peaking, we lie on a river bank where there is about a half meter drop and Ryder trips the fuck out thinking we'll die if we go close, we lie down and watch geometry wars in the sky, eventually I realise we should get home, so we begin walking again and we're about 2 minutes from home when FUCKING COP SIRENS. Holy shit, we were peaking so hard and tripped out. Look to my left, my friend Josh's house, FUCKING SAVED, Ryder is all for walking though so I have to like, shove him down the fucking driveway into the house, we chill out the front of Josh's house, it's like a secluded little veranda, until the cops leave then continue walking.

I'm gonna go out on a limb and say none of you have experienced something as intense as this. We're nearly home, a couple minutes, and then all of a sudden, the world lit, it was like there was a literal, MINI-SUN behind us, then EVERY FUCKING STREETLIGHT goes out and then they slowly come back on. To describe it, punch you computer screen, take the tony green part you see, and make that your whole world while you experience the feeling of freefalling. That was what it was like for me.

Since it happens 2 minutes after seeing the cops, we think it's them I FLIP MY SHIT AND NEARLY START RUNNING, Ryder is like, swearing his head off, and I don't even know what Robbie was doing, he was in his own world.

We finally get home, nothing really evenful happens there, eventually we head back out, this time with Ryder in a fucking foxsuit onsie, shit yes, we go back to the shops, buy maccas and get given a jesus book (this is 3am) and finally we get to the forshore.

1 year ago (December 9th) I dropped acid for the first time. I made pretty much every mistake i could have made (college the next day, stoned off my tits, was with someone i wasnt very comfortable with in his grotty room, had done no research into the drug whatsoever) needless to say at about 3am the trip went bad, and after turning out the lights and 'trying to go to sleep' my memories from there on were pretty much 5 hours of paralysing fear, thought loops, and body tremors.
This is extremely unlike me as i am usually quite smart with drugs, but that particular night i was quite stoned, and a clean record with previous drug experiences lulled me into a lapse in caution. 
Up until this point i had tried alcohol, weed, mushrooms, and MDMA, with good experiences all round.

Anyway i felt kind of odd after the trip, a feeling which was quite worryingly present even a few weeks afterwards. almost like i couldn't stop thinking about what had gone down, but i kept quiet and assumed it would pass. This culminated with me reading an article somewhere on the internet about someone who had droppped acid, had a bad trip, and 17 years later they are still dealing with the effects of it, anxious to this day. 
At this point i fucking lost it, and it marked the beginning of a spiral into anxiety and depression as i became assured that i to, was doomed to become an anxious wreck, unable to stop thinking about what had happened, and whether or not i had permanently ruined my mind. 
Here i am a year later, not the same wreck but i am still dealing with the issue. Many lessons have undoubtedly been learnt, but none that hath vanquished the troubling thoughts i battle. I just wanted to talk to reddit about it because it scares me to this day, and i still get waves of anxiety whenever the memory pops up. 

Mainly i would like to ask you whether my weed smoking habit plays a large part in this, because throughout this process i struggled alot with it, a thing that had previously caused me no bother at all, in fact it was something i classed as benefitting me. It was something i wrestled with, decided whether i needed to stop or not, because i do not want to say goodbye to Mary Jane forever. yet i can see that had i just abstained from the start, this may have passed a long time ago. It has been the main factor in a few flashbacks and relapses into anxiety, and i would like to ask ever-wise reddit if now, a year later, it is too late for such abstainance to wipe the slate clean, and start over.
Weirdly enough, another idea i played with alot was retrying the LSD experience, in an attempt to face up to the thing that scared me so deeply. but therapists and psychiatrists have advised strongly against it, as is expected..

I'm pretty versed in psychedelics and it seems like every time i trip there's a weird synchronicity or the universe giving me a high five. I'll share a couple that i can remember at the moment.
 
This spring i was tripping at a music festival and hanging out around the fire there was a girl selling jewelry she made. I was feeling pretty good so i took a look and although i don't ever wear jewelry i saw a pretty cool ring made from a piece of sterling silverware. It was a man's size and she only wanted 5 bucks for it so i figured what the hell. I ended up wearing that and another ring i bought for my girlfriend the whole night, and the next day driving home i'm looking at the ring and stamped on the inside was my last name.(obviously the manufacturer but what are the odds)

Another time my girlfriend and I are tripping on Halloween, We got all facepainted up like clowns and dia de los muertos skeletons and went to a show. When we couldn't find an afterparty we drove home and decided to walk around town at like 2 in the morning. So, we made some drinks and set out, probably a block down we heard some cats playing the Beatles, not blasting it but we could hear it from their open window so we said to ourselves ""Those guys must be cool, lets see if they want to party"" so we walked up the stairs and knocked on the door. We basically told the dude who answered we heard some groovy music and would they like to hang out.  It turned out THEY were all on acid too! We ended up smoking ganja and apparently weirding them the fuck out for like 3 hours, but it was a blast.

I'll just mention I wasn't in my own space or a setting that I was used to and I'm embarrassed to not have taken that more seriously at the moment with all of the time I put into learning about this drug. I really do take it seriously but in the moment I think I was trying to prove something and I tried to ignore my own anxieties which is never good. Any who, I took two tabs and was having a blast until I ate a portion of a very strong edible and when it hit me I lost it. Here are some things I experienced over the course of four hours (Until the xanax finally kicked in) and I was wondering if others had similar things happen: 

I was stuck in a cycle. My boyfriend would ask me ""Don't you remember you just did this?"" I would get up drink water go to the bathroom look in my bag for random things get more water go to the bathroom etc.. But I couldn't remember doing any of it immediately after doing it . 

My boyfriend asked me where something was (like my emergency xanax) and I would hand him a water bottle and was convinced it was whatever he was looking for. 

I had been going in and out of reality but in one moment I was holding my stomach and in the matter of seconds I felt my body go through an entire 9 month pregnancy and have birth. However the next thing I knew it was me who had been born. 

My boyfriend would ask me questions such as do you want the light off? do you want the music low? and I would reply yes which seems extremely normal except the entire time I was thinking that I had been almost dissociated and seeing my own process of my conscious mind making decisions and even though he was literally turning the light off or music low in my mind it was me all along. 

There were other times where everything would blur and all I can see is my boyfriends face come in and out. sometimes he would be telling me it was OK and I was fine and other times he was crying. However, every time I was able to see him again I felt myself wanting so bad to just grab him as though he were so far away and he was the only thing that would keep me from dying. but I could not move. 

I couldn't tell my boyfriend what day it was even. My boyfriend told me after this he thought that the next day he would have to tell everyone something terrible had happened to me and he was ready to take care of me for the rest of my life. He said I was acting like I was preparing to die. Honestly that's exactly what I was doing.

1375199962.0,14,self.LSD,1jcsdi,5 months ago I took LSD. I'm still not feeling very well.,18,4,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/LSD/comments/1jcsdi/5_months_ago_i_took_lsd_im_still_not_feeling_very/,"http://www.reddit.com/r/LSD/comments/17r4kk/tried_lsd_for_the_first_time_yesterday_night_it/

This is the original post. I still haven't fully recovered (or partially recovered, for that matter) with dealing with the ego death. More precisely, I can't deal with the fact that the sense of values I had is no longer there. When I try to probe ""bad thoughts"" to see if I get a negative response, I feel nothing. This has led me to believe that there might be a tiny positive response.

For example, one time (this was before I took LSD) I was riding my bike back from work at night, and the chain fell off. I stopped to fix it, when a man nearby started talking to me. I paid no attention to him. Then, when I was all done with the bike, I looked up to him and saw he was performing a very fast hand motion near his crotch. He was masturbating. I was immediately disgusted and felt sorry for him. I also thought it was a bit funny.
A few months later, I had to take a university entrance exam, and guess who was one of the staff. That's right. It was very fucked up. He recognised me, but I'm not sure he knew I recognised him.
Then a few months later, I was coming back from a club at night, and guess who was behind a tree. Indeed. This time he told me he wanted to suck a dick. I thought that was hilarious and continued riding my bike.

Now, when I was on LSD, I made the mistake of walking back home (this was around 4 in the morning). I had to cross the street I saw that man. I started remembering that dude, and I no longer thought he was harmless. Better yet, I felt *nothing* when I thought about it. That's what was disturbing. I mean, I didn't feel disgust, or desire. Just nothing.

Furthermore, when I think of, for example, killing someone, I also feel nothing. This is also disturbing.

So here's the deal:

I'm an app developer who also happens to trip Lucy from time to time. Too often, I feel that people take acid but do not have a thorough understanding of the powers, risks, and intricacies of it. I want to create an app geared towards people who are planning to drop and are subsequently currently dropping.

I am a very experienced app developer with 1,500+ downloads in the app store. My focus is on user interface and simplicity.

Who better to ask for help than a community of 10,528+ redditors interested in the drug and its effects?

###My ideas for the app... *I will keep this updated as new ideas are contributed*
* * *
MUSIC CONTROLLER (pick songs from library, play, pause, next), thats it
***
&gt;I like this feature because it gives the user an easy way to control their music while staying in the app. 
**I was also thinking about a ""suggested songs"" portion to go along. Maybe pick a mood and it'll play some jams? What songs/moods would you suggest?**

***
TRIP IDEAS
***
&gt; This will be a resource for people (and groups) who just want cool ideas for trip environments, activities, and so forth. **What's your coolest trip environment? What have you heard is fun? What are some cool things to do?**

***
INSTRUCTION MANUAL
***

&gt; A resource on what to expect, how to properly drop, suggested things to pack for a trip. **I need some material on this, looking for some suggestions!**

***
MUSIC VISUALIZER
***

&gt; Of course you don't want to be staring at your phone the whole time you're tripping, but it would be nice to flip this on while you're playing music. I want it to be something interesting to look at when you're tripping. **Any suggestions?**

***
ART
***

&gt; Cool pictures and art to stare at. Things with feeling. Things with moods. Things that MOVE.. **Suggestions?**

***
**If you have any more ideas for features of this app, say so! I would love to hear what kind of novel ideas you guys come up with. Also, if you feel like you could contribute to the design/functionality of the app, say so!**

*I want this app to be accessible to everyone interested in LSD, so it will be FREE in the app store. Lets make something COOL!*

Those whos' contributions make it into the app will get a spot on the ""special thanks"" page. Along with a link to their username.

Some people, be it because of their life situation or just a property of their personality, will just not enjoy having their mind turned inside out and being exposed to raw reality. That's a fact.

For the most part, the people I have seen freak out and have a difficult time are people that I either suspected would do so before hand or that, in hindsight, I could clearly see that taking acid was not a good idea for them.

I'm sure you know what I mean when I say that there are people I know, who in the course of learning about them, I have formulated ideas about how they would react to or deal with the experience, both good and bad. There seem to be personality types more suited to it and others that conflict with it. 

Do we, folk who are familiar with what one is committing themselves to when they drop, have any right to intervene when someone might be setting themselves up for a difficult experience? I have mixed feelings about it and could posit arguments either way. 

An ex-girlfriend of mine had always been interested in taking acid. When people who love it talk about it, it can sound so wonderful. Both a cousin or hers and myself had given her quarter tabs and she had enjoyed them, having positive experiences but she was always upset that we were prohibiting her from doses that we would ourselves have no worries about taking. Finally I relented and at a music festival we both dropped whole tabs, that turned out to be quite strong. I wasn't in any trouble myself, well within my comfort zone but she had an awful time and I did what I could to make it easier for her (which wasn't much tbh given that I was on acid).

She regretted it, in the end and I wished I had been more firm in my own beliefs about what she could handle. I could have prevented it. 

Have you ever doubted someone's ability to deal with acid? How did it turn out when they dropped? I have been both pleasantly surprised by people I didn't think would enjoy it but also regrettably unsurprised too by people who lived up exactly to my expectations. 

Is it morally sound to make these kind of judgments? Is it right to try to protect people from potentially damaging experiences? Should all people have an equal opportunity to take The Test? If someone doesn't take The Test they'll never know for sure.

here to share my first LSD experience - new years 2011/2012. I know it's a long way back but it is still imprinted in my brain minute after minute and up to date has still been the most amazing trip I experienced so far :)

I was in the mountains in Austria so everywhere around me where loads of snow and we spent the beginning of the night at a classical Austrian cottage. I dropped half a blotter cause I was a bit nervous and didn't want to risk too much. Blotter was tasteless so I was first confused but my friend calmed me saying that this was normal for proper LSD. After an hour I still felt nothing so my suspicion kept rising that it was just a piece of paper. I took the other half and went on chatting with the other people. Maybe half an our later I feel like my brain is shifting up a gear. Vision on my periphery got slightly blurred (Or I was actually first time really aware about peripheral vision), colours started to saturate and euphoria began to rise. Bam it hit me, I was instantaneously excited and reported back to my friend. When I saw his face I saw his amazonian frog like eyes and knew that he was already tripping balls way ahead of me.

I started enjoying the surrounding. As people where drunk around I felt really safe that nobody would recognize and joined in into the dancing. It was very strange as I felt like sometimes I'd be dancing in the middle of the whole crowd with everyone around me and then suddenly I would be outside that circle. Very very strange. The LSD by that time kicked in very hard and I think I was not fully aware of myself and rather went with the flow.

At midnight for some reason an ex-affair called me after not hearing from her for one year. I went into a separated room and crazily enough picked up the phone. I don't fully recall the conversation but that doesn't matter. The phone would have a tin canny mechanical sound and even my voice would be very muffled. It felt like the movie calls you hear in cinemas at times. The funny thing was I started to see that the light was moving in waves and emitted very warm and vibrant colours. This small room had also a small mountain diorama behind me and I felt like I was hearing animals (maybe it was the people mixing in from the other room) Well I turned and saw this fairy tale diorama with dwarfs, animals, trees and much more on it. It felt like it was alive and for a moment I was part of it.

I really don't know how I finished the call but ultimately I went outside and I saw the most beautiful thing. The night was dark and a bit of snow was falling - clear sharp crystals. The mountains looked like wrapped in very dense fluffy cotton and on everything lay this white heavenly gloom. We met outside with my friend and some other girls and decided to continue the journey - he recommended a shift of place. From this moment I was riding on the wave of LSD - my brain shifted another gear up but this time I felt I was under full control. You know when you drive first time a new car and you first are a bit careful with shifting. At some point you get a feel for the car - and I got the feel for LSD. Time to hit the pedal to the metal I took another half blotter.

The cottage was on a ski slope with an adjacent sleight trail into the village. We had small classical wooden sleighs prepared. We took each a girl in front of us and went down the track. It was crazy, I felt as in a race game like mario kart but with incredible graphics. The sleight would be wobbling in the turns we'd fall into the fluffy snow, cliche snow covered pine trees would pass us and the sky would be full of galaxies. The track was partly illuminated and as we raced it down the lights would greet us with their slowly emitting bursts of gloom.

Arriving in the village I felt already like a day had passed - my time perception was completely fucked up. Seconds became minutes and minutes became several minutes. Not speaking bout hours. Walking down the street I was amazed by the tyre tracks of cars printed into the snow. They had such a perfect shape and icy reflection. Looking back at the mountain we just went down I saw the whole track moving in wave forms with the lights slowly swinging back and forth. We came into a bar where people would stand around a log of would. They would have steel nails prepared on the log and try to hit them with the thin end of a claw hammer. After observing the scene and enjoying the sound of the hammer hitting the wood and metal the people invited us to join. I took the hammer, prepared a nail and then charged the hammer at it. I felt like I was not doing it, I was just observing in slow-motion how the thin tip of the hammer would run down on the nail - hit it perfectly and sink it with one hit into the log. I didn't realize to much the people around me but I guess they where shocked as I was.

Next I went to the toilet and I felt as if the room would be out of some weird early 90s music video with crazy colours, and nonuniform shapes. We left this establishment, it must have been around 4 and went into one close to our hotel. That is when the freaky part of LSD kicked in. This place was kinda know for fuck ups to reside in so I was already worried during the trip to the place. Crazily enough as we enter right in the entry are two paramedics holding down a 20 something girl who is screaming like a pig and blood is spraying out of her right shank. She must have stepped on some glass cause the floor was covered in it. First I wasn't shocked and observed the scene like a movie than luckily my friend pulled me out and we decided to go to the hotel room.

As we reached the hotel I felt I was back to myself and only the visuals prevailed. To come back to the car analogy, after hitting the pedal to the metal going of the gas and just letting it roll out - no breaking. So we started playing in the hotel room with anything we got into our hands. I played probably a good half an hour in the sink with cold and warm water flowing over my hands. Then we would grab ice from the balcony and watch it melting on the palm of our hands. All simple things but such delighting experiences.

During 7 am I decided to go to sleep as for the morning the program called for a 1 hour walk to another cottage at the afternoon. Well what can I say? I haven't slept a minute. Upon closing the eyes I would have images of deeply coloured fractals and kaleidoscopic patterns. Visuals didn't stop in the end until I went to bed during the next evening. In the afternoon I was actually for a few moments scared I might have done some permanent changes to my brain.

Looking back despite some difficult moments I like to recall that trip very much. It showed me the many facets of LSD there are and I got to understand why it is called a trip. I really felt that I left for another world and once in a while a light would have its gloomy wavy features like a nice greeting from this other reality.

Btw. some recommendations for first timers ... don't use on yourself any strong perfume or deodorant. As your senses increase so does your capacity to smell and these substance tend to stick on you. Really annoying when you smell cologne no.5 or which ever you use, all the time instead of all the other nice stuff :)

I wrote about it at length on this subreddit a while ago but I'm too lazy to find it. Long story short: started out fantastic, left group of friends (don't remember why), had a panic attack (didn't know what it was at the time so I thought I was dying), got caught in several seemingly infinite thought loops which involved insecurities I didn't know I had, got naked, yelled incoherently, and had several incredibly strange hallucinations and delusions which I'm still unable to describe accurately through text. Basically everything that could go wrong during a trip happened. I couldn't remember most of the peak of that trip until three months later when I had a traumatizing flashback after smoking during an acid trip which culminated in a panic attack as I felt myself starting to enter the same thought loop I had previously (thankfully I was able to pull myself out). Before that trip I thought that I had simply imagined everything that happened and it was shocking to realize that I actually experienced everything I thought I had made up. For the rest of the trip I was convinced that I had become psychotic and triggered schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or some other mental illness. I still fear this even though I have been told by medical professionals that I do not have either. Although I do experience depression from time to time, no mental illnesses have been known to run in my family. I had never experienced anxiety until after these experiences.

So I swore off psychedelics for a while until March of last year when I thought I was ready and took two hits of acid by myself. The trip went smoothly until I had a thought and visuals that reminded me of the initial bad trip when I was 16 and started to panic a bit. I alleviated the panic by taking a tablet of lorazepam but I felt terrible about ""aborting"" the trip and not being able to work through it. I told myself I wasn't ever going to take acid again and I was left with general anxiety for a couple months after that. Weed would make me anxious and remind me of the bad trip and any other drug experiences I had (cannabis, 2c-b, mdma) would remind me of that trip. I refused to smoke for a while and took a few breaks.

Since then I've started to analyze these experiences every day in depth and identify certain issues and insecurities I needed to work on. I've also started to see a therapist and experiment successfully with yoga and meditation. Over the past year I've undergone a rapid restructuring of my ego and my view of the world and the universe (some might call this ""growing up""). I experience derealization and depression on and off but I've learned to accept it as just another perspective of reality. Originally I had thought I had had psychotic episode with the initial experience but after researching all that I can, I've started to think that I was just fighting ego-death. Hopefully I'm better prepared to handle states of ego-loss.

I haven't taken any drugs other than cannabis since July of last year up until last week. While I still experience some anxiety from it, it's nowhere near as bad as it was earlier last year and I don't smoke nearly as often. I took a small dose of MDMA last weekend and had an amazing time. Now I have the opportunity to purchase LSD and I want to give it yet another chance. Prior to these not-so-good experiences LSD was my favorite drug and I still remember those 3 or so experiences that blew my mind and changed my worldview for the better. Even though my ""bad"" trips caused me a great deal of worry, I do not regret them at all. Anyways, my plan is to buy three hits and take one. If I enjoy myself on one then I'll take the other two at a later date, possibly in conjunction with a small dose of MDMA I have stashed somewhere. I feel that one tab will be enough to get me re-acquainted with the psychedelic experience but still allow me to have enough contact with reality to recognize that I'm tripping if things happen to go south. I expect to run into anxiety and even panic but I plan to just work through it and any other issues I may have reminding myself that acid will not kill me and that I'm just experiencing ego-loss (possibly while reading excerpts from The Psychedelic Experience by Timothy Leary). I also plan to meditate and perform yoga sometime during the experience. However, my main fear is that my plans will go out the window at the slightest feeling of panic and I'll be in the same situation I was in last time, undoing all progress I have made over the past year and a half. So I come to you guys for a second opinion.

1358441380.0,10,self.LSD,16rbx0,Integrating my fear during an acid trip - need advice,14,4,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/LSD/comments/16rbx0/integrating_my_fear_during_an_acid_trip_need/,"Hello fellow psychonauts.  I come to you seeking advice for my future trips.  I am fairly inexperienced in the psychedelic world as I have only tripped twice on acid before and a few times on salvia.  My last trip on acid involved two tabs.  Reality was mostly intact, with the visuals I experienced being vibrant, saturated colors and seeing a lot of facial patterns in everything.  I enjoyed my trip for the majority of it, but I had some difficulty around 6 hours or so that I would like some advice on.

As night came, I noticed the hallucinations were more as my mind had shadows to play with now.  In my spare room, which has a small night-light and a tall mirror, I decided to look at myself in the mirror.  I had done this plenty of times before in the day with no difficulty.  While I saw my face almost “age” in a sense, I really didn’t see morphing of anything.  This changed at night.  My face began to subtly twist so that my mouth spiraled into a circular void.  My eyes were similar, almost giving the appearance that I was a demon.  This scared me.  I began feeling anxious as I was faced with the reality that I was out of control.  I saw my boyfriend’s face appear darker around his eyes.  Although I knew I had taken acid and it was temporary, the fear was prominent.  I began feeling the familiar anxiety of a panic attack.  My rational brain told myself all the things you’re supposed to, yes it’s a drug, that wasn’t real, this is what I signed up for, etc.  However, that wouldn’t make the fear of seeing reality distorted disappear.  I told myself then that I am just not the type of person who is capable of dealing with reality distortion.  Perhaps tripping is not for me, I thought.  I tried calming myself, but I could only think, what if I start seeing his face melt, or other hallucinations.  It did not appeal to me.  Seeing myself in the mirror change like that was the first time I truly saw hallucinations of what was in front of me.  The saturation and patterns in everything were fine – they were harmless after all!  But something about seeing objects or people change in front of my eyes immediately scares me.  Around this point I also started to get tired of tripping.  7 hours in and I was sick of the body load (often feeling uncomfortable in my stomach) and didn’t like the feeling of my eyes burning as they dilated so large, so frequently.  That most likely had an impact on my experience as well.

I believe that it is all a based on a few simple things: a fear of the unknown and a lack of control.  If I start to hallucinate, it will be out of my control.  I have no idea what I might see.  I am at times a dark person and often in these scenarios, my mind goes to dark thoughts.  Perhaps that is where the fear comes from.  With my mind unleashed, will it be a self-fulfilling prophecy where I do not want to see/think of dark things, but that mere desire will send me into those thoughts?  Or perhaps it goes beyond that and it’s just a simple fear of losing control and facing the unknown.  What a bizarre thing to be afraid of though considering one is never in control of the unknown, especially in your day to day life.

So the question comes to this, how do I integrate that experience and prepare for future journeys?  Like I mentioned before, during that experience (and actually my first acid trip), I felt like I simply do not like reality distortion in that way and tripping is not for me.  But I believe I do.  I certainly enjoy the other aspects of tripping.  For the majority of the day I felt very euphoric and had a great time with my boyfriend who was not tripping but simply high on cannabis.  How can I confront that fear and anxiety?  During my experience, I couldn’t simply talk myself out of it.  However being tired of tripping took away my energy and I just attempted to avoid the waves and watch TV, instead of redirecting my thoughts into a acid-worthy activity.

Thanks for reading if you made it through this.  It was therapeutic to type it all out.
 
**TL;DR:** Acid is enjoyable but when the visuals distort reality (beyond the first few levels of saturated colors, patterns in everything), it often scares me and I feel afraid of losing control.  How do I master that fear so that I have an enjoyable experience next time I trip?

He's tripped quite a few times, and all of them were good trips. It sucks for me to know that I can never understand what his experiences were like because I've never tried it.

I'm highly curious about it. I've done some research and saw that video of the 1950s housewife who drank LSD. She thought it was a beautiful experience. I would like to experience something mind-blowing like that. I would like to go through something that would change my life forever, but only in a highly positive way of course. But I'm worried.

I tried pot a couple of times, and while I had a few good experiences with it, most of the time I would feel paranoid. I ate really strong pot brownies and pot fruit roll-ups (in two different occasions) and I didn't enjoy the experiences at all. I was always anxious and worried about what people would think of me. The fruit roll-ups experience was so bad for me that it made me super depressed for a couple of weeks.

I've also tried this synthetic marijuana called ""Panic"" and of course, I panicked. I seriously thought I was going to die, so I freaked out, HARD. This also made me depressed for a bit.

I've had my depressed bouts, and I'm currently going through another one. But I'm also searching for something more with my life. I'm trying to find something that would get me out of this funk and appreciate the beauty that life has to offer. 

I keep hearing so many great things about LSD, and that it's different than pot because it won't make you paranoid or give you that same high feeling. And I know that you shouldn't take LSD if you or your family has a history of schizophrenia or other serious emotional/mental issues like that.

Any advice?",12,0,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/LSD/comments/12pyne/im_planning_on_taking_2_sugar_cubes_tomorrow_but/,"First off, I've had shrooms 8 times, but acid only twice.

Anyways, I'm always confident while tripping, and I have no worries of having a bad trip ever. The 2 times I had acid, I actually thought an eighth of shrooms packed much more of a punch. Not to say I didn't enjoy acid, I just thought it would be stronger.

So I had been wanting to move up to 3 tabs, but now that I have sugar cubes, and this guy telling me 'whatever you do, don't take 3!' Should I just believe the guy and only take 1? He had a vial, but I didn't watch him when he dropped the lsd onto the cubes.

Edit - I know most of you are going to tell me to go the safe route and just take 1. But I'm willing to push my limits this time. Do you still think the risk is worth it?

Final Edit - I ended up taking 3. For about an hour I was struggling with reality. My vision was easily getting blurred by everything trying to split. But eventually that ended, and I enjoyed the rest of the night getting lost in music. Almost entered another state, it seemed.

Or are the personality changes largely positive, ie increased motivation to go to the gym, eat healthy, study, be friendly, etc?  Am I way off in both magnitude and scope of changes people have? Perhaps these changes are just purely of a philosophic nature, having little affect of people's regular lives (I can and do believe there's no intrinsic *point* to life, but that doesn't stop me from enjoying it sort of thing).

This would seem like an ideal way out as I've heard bad trips can be horrible and the only downside I can think of would be getting in trouble with police.

Sometimes you witness something so impactful that you can not help but accept it into your mind eventually.
Which is why I am finally deciding to put into words my experience from 3 months ago.
This was my third trip, I had 2 more over the previous month and a half. The first 2 were great and taught me a lot about myself, but I was left with a feeling of wanting something more. The first 2 trips teased at something much bigger, and I needed to find out what that was.
So I took the leap, dropped 3 tabs compared to 2 my first couple times, and that made all the difference.

The main issue was my environment. I was in a comfortable enough setting, I was in my apartment, but with way too many people, and way too many people who I did not really know. I was in a strange depressive funk at the time and my mind was definitely thinking differently due to the excessive amount of weed I had been smoking and how much I had been sulking for the past 6 months. I was ""living in my head.""
Only later did I realize how little I actually knew what that meant.

At first things are going well, I am listening to Sigur Ros in my room with a couple other people and the music literally sucked me in. The most pleasant bodily sensations I had ever felt. It felt like with every reverberation my entire body was given a massage from the inside and out, I felt divine. 
Later I found out after this I started talking to one of the randoms at my house about God and spirituality, and apparently what I said had scared him to the point he left my house crying. I have no recollection of this, and he was not tripping. Just thought I should throw that in there as a sort of foreshadow.

God and religion were definitely 2 things really eating at me and bugging me beforehand, but I didn't really acknowledge it, but what acid seems to do is open up yourself to your true thoughts, and soon I was stuck in a loop where I kept questioning my existence and what was happening, I was freaking out, I literally felt my soul was leaving my body and I had no control over it, and I couldn't accept that, I just couldn't accept losing my sense of self. I wasn't ready to know I existed as anything more than just me. 
Eventually I lost it, I just kept going in circles talking to myself just trapped in this loop, and eventually I snapped out with the statement ""God does not exist. Oh my God, God does not exist!""
And that scared the fuck out of me
and thats where I really lost it.

I felt my entire life didn't happen, that it was all in my mind, and I was just going through one of the cycles of ""life"". The realization that I am something much bigger than just ""what I am"". I believed I was one of a few people who were blessed enough to realize that there was something so much more, and I eventually snapped out. It was like snapping out of one brain into another one if that makes sense, but the brain I had now snapped into was so much more capable than the one before, and in this new ""brain"", I existed infinitely, I had completely lost that feeling that I exist. That one thing that when you close your eyes and really zone out that is always there. It was just gone. 
I felt I had lived my life up until that point as a teenage girl (Im a guy), Just bitching about the stupidest things and getting sad over everything and I was having a really hard time accepting how I was in my ""previous brain"" and the life I lived. I couldn't come to terms with the fact I was now a new being, I just wanted to be my old self again and live my life and appreciate it (which eventually I did do).

After this freak out, I just laid down and hugged something myself as reaffirmation, that I still existed, and I laid back, and went into my mind. 
I found out I was literally inside of my head, and that even though this was all a trip, it didn't make it any less real than ""real life"", because what is real life, but what our minds can perceive? Then I realized I was actually apart of something much bigger than myself, and as a human being I could not understand why, and it reaffirmed my faith in a God. ""There is something bigger than me, just accept it, and be grateful that you are blessed to be apart of this something.""

I realized heaven might as well be a place in the mind, and hell might be the same. Because I knew that if I was not freaking out so hard, I could have went where ever I liked, and there was a moment where I stopped freaking out for a little bit and went somewhere that made me feel content, and I could have stayed there forever, but then something told me  ""you haven't lived your life yet you will get here when you die, this is just a peak behind to keep you going"". It sure as hell did keep me going

I honestly did not even cover a quarter of what I experienced, and I do not even know if I worded that in a way that will make sense to any of you. I just hope someone can at least somewhat feel what I am trying to get at.

I've decided to take acid for the first time and thought I'd run my plans by you guys.

Prior drug experience: Alcohol and Weed

People: My girlfriend and I. She's a first timer as well. We plan on having her friend be our sitter, who will be sober. She won't be around the whole time so there aren't any worries about her killing a vibe or anything like that.

Place: Either her or my apartment. We have some great parks nearby as well, so during the comedown we'll venture out there

Dosage: Probably two tabs each. Maybe one each if we decide to take it light for our first time, especially since the exact dosage will be unknown.

Music: A little bit of this, little bit of that. Daft Punk Alive 2007 and Sgt. Pepper's are a must, though I'm open to suggestions in this department

Other: We do plan on having two pills of Xanax around in case things get darker than we plan. This being said, this is more of a last resort than a first response. Also, we will probably have some pot on hand to help the trip/calm us down towards the end.

I remember, barely,
one night
in February
when the sky cried
melencholy tears
of Mother Earth's blood.

Another man, it
seems, not me,
who -- with a bloated
sense of Self --
thought that he
was ready to see
God.

Small square of
the skin of trees
under his naive tongue,
he laughed his anxiety
in to madness.

Maybe, had he known
that in order
to see God
he would have to die,
he wouldn't
have been so
eager.

Reality dripped away
like the sky's tears
from his Jeep's
windshield.
Caught between devouring light
and the void
he asked, ""What time
is it?"" again and again
as he breathed
the lives and deaths
of countless lifetimes.

Feeling
the end near and
having spent himself
whilst holding onto all, he knew
he'd soon
be gone.

With a final lament --
how could it endlike this? --
he let go.
An eye remeniscent
of Egyptian falcons'
was last he saw
this side
of Eternity;
he died and became
one
with the Universe.

With the death of my Self I realized
we are all looking out through
God's eyes.

Before I did acid, I thought that bad trips were a result of getting false lsd that forced you to go into a bad loop. But I did last Friday with a friend and it changed my mind on it, and my new theory is that your experience is reliant on your outlook on life and how you hand the good and the bad.

Heres the back-story

Kicked in after 40-45 minutes. We were having a good time talking about our 'realizations' about life as we walked down a bike path. Everything felt really awesome but maybe so intense that it was also really scary as well. My friend started to blame the drug saying that he was going through a bad spell, and he wanted to go home and sleep it off. So we walked back to my place and I played him music while he napped, until he felt better.

But even when I was feeling a that crushing negative feeling, I didn't want to run away from it because I felt it was part of life .. like how with Ying-Yang, you can't have the good without the bad (Because it is necessarily white and black). All I wanted to do it experience it, because it made me feel alive and I felt that it was the natural thing to experience the negative after so much positive, but I was worried about my friend so I ended up shutting it out with music and taking my mind off it.

I was hoping to get some insight from more experienced people on what it means when someone says you got into a bad trip?

LSD let me feel like I was the captain of the ship for once. I didn't get wrapped up in my own head for hours on end and it was MUCH easier to handle than a mushroom trip.

I'm glad I finally took the plunge because it really is an amazing drug. Sex feels oh so good on it and watching my room look like a salvador dali painting for six hours was a blast!

Background:

I've been experimenting with LSD for about 9 months now. I've had about 20 trips ranging from 150 to 700 micrograms. I've been steadily upping my dose over the summer, and tripping either weekly or every two weeks. Yesterday was the 700+ microgram dose.

My solo trip ritual was about the same, if not somewhat rushed because I was so excited to push past the 500 microgram dose range that I had been teetering on. Cleared the house, laid pillows and comforters. Set up my usual trinkets and odds and ends. Meditated for a small bit.

I took the dose about noon and within half an hour I was on the ground looking at my fingertip and contemplating how remarkable the day was as I slowly slipped into the trip without even knowing it. I had a revelation that was so absurd (but true) about myself that I began to laugh. The laugh felt like it lasted ages, and before long I was out of breath. My airways were wide, and I was in a panic. I made the poor choice of going downstairs and getting a glass of water, thinking it might calm me down. On my way back up the trip kicked in hard, and as I made my way up the stairs I could feel my head inflating and the entire world bent around me as I walked. Before I could reach the top of the stairs I had forgotten everything about myself, where I was, what I was doing except that I was on acid and that I realized 'oh, so this is what a bad trip is like.'  'Oh, now I understand.' A rather terrifying moment was when I realized that I thought I was dying and I thought, ""Oh, Okay."" As if I didn't even care.

I was so panicked. One of the things I thought about was taking a picture of myself to check whether I appeared to be in distress, but then I thought it didn't matter because I was insane and I wouldn't be able to tell anyway. I vaguely recall looking in the bathroom mirror, seeing a terrified man looking back at me and slamming the door shut. Foolishly, I turned on my computer and sent a few panicked messages to a friend online -- the chat window still open from earlier in the morning. I instantly thought he was going to call the police, an ambulance, and I would be in trouble. Reading the logs back, it was clear he had no intention. I had, in my paranoid state, read back my own words thinking they were his. 

I spent the next hour or so peaking, pacing, going in and out of rooms in a panicked state. Eventually I came down some, put on some music, and calmed down. 

Here's an excerpt from the chat log: http://pastebin.com/5wFbhjUB

It's somewhat funny to read, but I was terrified. I'm reminded even though LSD has been kind, gentle, rewarding, and healing it is still a powerful drug. I'm going to spend a while without tripping to decompress and think about this last trip. I've left some of the insights that I need to think about out of this post because I'm not sure just what they all mean, and it would be a tantamount to a lie to share them just now.

Thanks for reading, or not -- as you will.

P.S. Have any of you ever felt ""inflated"" or had the world bend around you (it looked a bit like the gravitational lens effect) during a trip? I've had a slight fishbowl effect (on top of the usual lsd visuals) before--but never like this. It was so bizarre. I almost wonder if I was in some kind of distress.

For me: I was tripping on three tabs with a close friend (he was on three as well). We decided to watch the Truman Show, since we both love it and it has a trip-worthy plot. About halfway through, I essentially break from the world for a bit. Time becomes distorted and I begin to see it as a variable (only slightly). What I mean by this was that I could look at my clock, count to 10, and look back and minutes would have passed. Additionally, I had vivid flashbacks to forgotten parts of my life (still happens semi-frequently). I told my friend and asked him to count with me and he ended up having the same effect, minus the flashbacks. We chalked it up to just tripping hard and shrugged it off. After the movie, we talked about the construction of one's identity and what it means to be a human. We both began to describe our inner selves to the extent you can know yourself while tripping and slowly we began to share consciousness. When I say this, I mean it loosely. We communicated through vibes almost flawlessly and acted according to what both of us were 'vibing', without talking at all. We went from a smoke sesh, to a trip to the park, to finding a stray cat in our cellar, all without talking at all. At the end of the trip, we could physically feel it dieing down, and both commented on it's conclusion at the exact same time.

We were all laughing our asses off. I started to realize that most of my friends kind of looked like different species of animals. My friends girlfriend seemed to kind of have a hawk aura radiating around her, and my other friend had kind of a mole aura. After a couple hours (while coming down) I walked back to my apartment and watched nature ""breathe"" of some sort. Everytime the wind would russle the plants they seemed to grow taller and taller. Eventually, I made it to my door and walked past my dad hoping he wouldn't notice my extremely dialated pupils. After steathily avoiding a catastrophe I went to my room and relaxed by watching some south park and the background and listening to calming music. Sooner or later I started to notice that I could see the characters translucent skeletons under there garbs. And then. three of every character would start to envelope. I turned my head out of utter creepiness and went on to listening to some DnB. After about 30 minutes of getting my mind blown by the awesome bass drops, my father came in and asked if I wanted to watch the *cam* version of avengers and I agreed. During the movie I could not stop thinking about life and our planet ,my mind was completely wondering off of the blury movie. I soon became to wonder, what was the point? What is the point of our life on this utterly beautiful planet that we live on?
After intense thought I started to realize that maybe the point to life is to learn as much as possible about the homosapien and the other organisms that thrive on our beatuiful planet and about the massive universe that surronds everything around us.

Hello! :)

**Background info: me and my best friend are planning on taking 1 tab each.** Her experience with drugs is E and coke; mine is a handful of 2ce trips, and 1 tab in my dorm 2 friends (one tripping and a sitter), which was great although very confusing at times (like trying to open the faucet for my shower for 20min...). We're not planning on having a sitter, but we have friends that live within walking distance and are aware.

**Option 1 TL;DR: beach, but high traffic street to cross to get home from it.**
There's a ""beach"" (deck and some sand) and a nature trail half a mile and 1.5mi away around a very nice, quiet set of streets in walking distance. there's sometimes some few people there, although half of them are probably stoners or ok with people acting strange (art school). only problem is, we have to cross a 3-lane street to get to that quiet area from my friend's apt, which i'm sure we'd be able to do if we had to come back... as long as we weren't tripping too hard (i've never peaked outside, let alone near streets). Or we could call a friend to walk us if we figured out how to use our cellphones. 

**Option 2 TL;DR: Really sweet on-campus apt.**
She has a roommate who's never there and would know we're tripping and is ok with it. it's on campus, although a little off to the side, but I don't think we could get away with acting too weird outdoors like staring closely at trees for hours and shit... So we'd mostly stay inside. We have paint, art supplies, music, games, and a lot of space, though. 

**I want to make this as safe and as awesome as possible for her and myself. Any tips?**

Thanks!

Had a great time running around the college town with friends all day playing frisbee, enjoying the sights and getting funny looks from people. Come nightfall, the four of us were sitting outside, and I was passed a pipe full of amazing chronic, then took some deep rips of hookah. The experience shifted DRAMATICALLY from childlike wonder/playfulness to a sort of heightened awareness that was both deeply introspective and analytical, becoming frighteningly intense at times. My friends all went inside, and I did not move from the chair on the porch for about 6 hours, mostly just staring straight ahead at the wall. I realized I didn't need to speak words, and I got some amazing insight as to oneness and the nature of existence. In my recent browsing of wikipedia articles on Buddhism, it sounds like I entered an advanced state of meditative trance completely by accident. 

This was 6 months ago, and I have recently come into contact with a clean source of this magical chemical. Now that I understand the true power of LSD over the mind, I feel I could use it to guide myself into an even higher state of consciousness, using only one hit. The first trip sort of blindsided me and was rather confusing, but I feel if I go into the experience with the intent of focusing my thoughts into a higher plane, I could achieve something quite interesting. 

My intention is not to ""fry on acid, bro"", I want to elevate my being. I have come to understand that my brain works on a level different from that of most of the population, and LSD can take my consciousness to new heights at which I can remain after the effects of the drug wear off. 

The plan is to scope out a nice spot in nature on a clear starry night, make a little comfort circle, have a few mantras set out on paper to steer my mind from fear and guilt, and begin training to dive as deep as I possibly can into the deepest recesses of consciousness. This will be the first of what I believe to be many such experiences. I will not move until the trip is over. Since most of my friends are just in it for the happy fun times and doing normal everyday things while on acid, I come to this community of psychonauts. Thoughts/opinions? Guidance?

TL;DR: what age would you recommend to try out LSD?



Edit: It seems like a lot of people started tripping at 16. There also seems to be a consensus that I should wait until I'm 18, or, even better, 21~ish. I'd have to say, reluctantly, that I agree because I'd hate to go to jail for posession and ruin my HS grades. That being said, I'll just continue to lurk around and further familiarize myself with the drug, and when I'm independent I'll be fully prepared to have an awesome first psychadelic exerience.

So, I've done blotter four times, and have a good feeling for it. I generally know the dosage range I can deal with, and actually feel fine with the idea of a bigger trip.

I have a number of sugar cubes with one drop each on them, and the drop size was very consistent between each cube - as best as I can tell that's the normal size drop an eyedrop bottle will make.
I don't know the dilution level, though. It was very liquid (i.e. as thin as water) and a very slightly yellowed shade of clear. 

Any guesses as to how many doses one cube is? I'd like to take ~3 average blotter hits worth (~150 ug).

I recently tripped with one of my best friends, we'll call him Tony.  Something happened that I'm not sure what to think about.

Tony has always had a bit of an arrogance problem.  I know him well enoough to know that he isn't a shallow person--but you have to know him for quite a while to realize this because in his day to day life he is pretty full of himself.  I've see him send mean text messages just to burn bridges with girls where things haven't gone quite right.  I've heard him say things that made me question his character.  Recently out of the Navy and skating through life on his GI bill, he had been spending 100% of his time getting as high (marijuana) as possible.  Don't get me wrong, I love this guy.  It's hard to find a person that is so honest about where he stands and so loayal about his friendships.  Still, it was my oppinion (and that of some fello psychnauts) that he could benefit from some introspection.

I mentioned that I had tried acid recently and he was curious about it.  He wanted to trip with me.  I'd never push a psychadelic on somebody--you either want to or you don't and peer pressure shouldn't factor into it.  I must confess I may have been a bit too encouraging.

We went camping.  I had told him that he shouldn't get stoned... that he should wait to see how he handles the acid and then consider smoking.  In typical Tony fashion, he got blazed.  When I mentioned it to him and he said that he had previously had some doubts about where his trip would take him and this was the only way to make sure he had the right mindset when he dosed.  I must admit, it worked.  He was in exactly the right trippin' mood.  He was excited and curious and down to both have a blast and have some deep conversations.  

My good friend James and myself had decided that four hits was the number for us.  We had all talked about three for Tony and liked that number, but had a fourth ready in case he was really feeling gung-ho about it all.  Out in the woods, in February, at about 10,000 feet, on acid, is not exactly the smartest survival choice, and somebody had joked about ""we could die out here.""  The joke then became: if anybody is going to die today, it's going to be of happiness.  This will turn out to be ironic later.

James and I took our four.  Tony took three and half an hour later decided that he wanted to be at the same level as we were, so then took his fourth.  This is another thing I regret, this was some good stuff--four is not a newbie-friendly number.  But the set and setting were perfect, I thought what the hell.

The first three hours were absolutely amazing.  I could go on for pages about it.  Suffice it to say, best trip ever--so far.

After a small hike we came back to camp and Tony was babbling on.  He is a loudmouth anyway, we didn't think anything of it, but it later became apparent that he wasn't with us anymore.  I've seen people messed up out of their minds, but usually they have a concept of who they are, who you are, where they are.  The words coming out of his mouth were pure nonesense.  I would make him look at me and say ""Tony, who am I?""  And he would say ""All that fire, with the eyes above, and we totally made it here.  We got here guys, we did it.""

It did not seem to me like the sort of thing you come down from or sleep off.  He had lost his mind.  His shoes began to melt by the fire, so I was going to his car to get his other pair, and had to search all of his pockets for keys.  I was very upset by all of this, and at one point hugged him.  During our hug he did this hip/ass caress thing.  I'm sure it wasn't a homosexuality issue--not that I'd have a problem if it was, I'm just quite sure about Tony.  He wasn't aware that who he was hugging was male.  Several times I had to physically *make* him sit down to prevent him from wandering off in the woods.  

James and I were so glad that he wasn't violent--because if he had been we would have had to tie him up.  We were suddenly camping with somebody who belonged in a mental asylum.  He seemed to have his wits about him well enough to not sit on the fire, but not enough to know better than to up-end a gallon jug of water on his head in the middle of a snow storm (the weather turned on us).  We were legitimately convinced that we killed our friend.  I took his phone so that I could call his mom to explain that her son was no more, because there was no shred of Tony in there.  He was a nattering fool.  He just kept going on about ""The eyes, and I control all of this, as we did it, we are here to watch it all burn but it is ours so it's ok, just keep the ground at bay.""

EDIT: we were only going to call his mom if he didn't come out of it after a couple of days.  He lives with her and she'd be wondering why he didn't come home--or why he was unable to tie his shoes.

This went on for three hours before he started addressing us as people again.  He'd come in and out.  As we came down Tony came back to us.  At eight hours post-dose we had him back fully, though he still was having a hard time understanding why we had been so upset.

Since then he has been more introspective, more respectful of people, and hasn't been stoned all the time.  He had an amazing time, he was elated through the whole trip.  Basically, instead of peaking, he died of happiness.  He wants to trip again with us, though probably won't get high beforehand an wants to just to two or three.
  
  I've read about how LSD can bring out latent psychosis in people, and that's all I can think of to explain it.  Then again, I've heard of people that went to entirely different universes--no connection to reality at all--when tripping.  I don't know what happens to their body when they do this, so maybe that's all that happened.  He has no memory of the time when we should have been peaking (his behavior kind of killed it for us) but looks back on it fondly.
 
--------

**tl;dr**
My friend dropped four hits of acid with us and went insane.  Not the good kind of insane, but the maybe-we-need-a-straight-jacket kind of insane.  He came out of it later, but we're still worried.
  
 My questios for reddit:  Should I be worried about his mental state? He always has been a bit off...  Is this an indication that he should see someone professionally, or did James and I make too-big of a deal out of it?  Should I trip with him again?  Should I ever let him trip again?

--------

**EDIT:  I want to thank you all for your replies.  I'm beginning to see that the fact that I'm so worried about this is much more my problem than his.  I'm definitely going to be more careful about how much I let beginners dose, and I'm also going to avoid the judgmental attitude that I had.  ""He could really use some introspection"" bah! and I called him arrogant.  Seriously, I needed somebody to tell me to chill out.  Thanks again.**

11:30pm - took one hit of acid after drinking one large mug of weed tea.

11:53pm - got the idea to document my LSD trip.

12:12am - still don't feel anything. i seem to remember that acid takes a lot longer than weed does to take effect...man i'm impatient.

12:44am - watching Craig Ferguson - still feel nothing. if i don't feel anything by the end of Craig's show i'm taking the other hit. i just wanna see some crazy beautiful things.

1:24am - still nothing! although...am feeling a little buzzy. i really hope it kicks in soon :P

2:17am - had 2nd hit cuz i still feel NOTHING!! plz kick in soon plz!!

3:00am - yep. still nuthin. sweaty and fuzzy but not seeing shite. pout.

3:22am - have resigned myself to a body stone (still enjoyable...writing and music are fucking fantastic) but yeah, kinda wish i was hallucinating.

3:28am - heard fiona apple's song Slow Like Honey. damn.

3:46am - time is definitely being percieved differently but the fact that i can still coherently type long words is a sign of what i am NOT seeing. oh...lights are getting a tad ""glowy""

3:52am - started watching that Mila Kunis movie Moving McAllister because well, she's hot and I liked her sketch on Craig Ferguson's show tonight. (closed window by accident and left it at that)

4:14am - am starting to feel it more now...mmm

4:20am - got munchies (?) and ate an apple. ha ha 420

5:03am - have seriously resigned that this is a hallucinating trip...but still hopeful sunrise holds some amazing-ness. had a wicked convo with Cass and online with cool reddit ppl. I love my fellow ents.

5:18am - started watching Jesus Camp...good idea? 

6:10am - Jesus Camp is a fantastic doc...why aren't more people aware of this insanity??

7:11am - have settled into a great chat with a scotsman about religion and fanatacism in society. heading out for Zo's soon...am craving human contact.

7:20am - left house.

10:47am - back from coffee/walk/around town stuff...have decided that this acid is very very very mellow. Not so much the hallucinating kind although even as I write this the words are all bendy and floaty...Anyway. Good poems/short story ideas and some interesting recordings of me playing guitar which I will have to listen to later. Am going to sleep now for a long time.

1375952688.0,12,self.LSD,1jy20e,Thoughts on solo tripping and bad trips,13,1,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/LSD/comments/1jy20e/thoughts_on_solo_tripping_and_bad_trips/,"Over the past couple months, I've had quite a few trips, including group trips, solo trips, and solo trips interrupted by sober/not-so-sober friends. I've noticed something: At least for me, bad trips happen much *less* frequently when I'm completely alone.

For example, when tripping with people:

* If I begin to have a thought loop, one of them is bound to point out that I've been asking the same question for the past 15 minutes. While I don't blame them, this is just as scary as telling a dementia patient that they've got dementia.

* Communicating is incredibly difficult, and some people just want to keep talking. 30 second pauses to think and trailing off in the middle of a sentence become extremely noticeable for both parties in a conversation, potentially stressing the speaker and making them extremely frustrated.

* There is an almost palpable group energy. While this can be wonderful in happy moments, it only adds to the verbal and gestural communication problem. People on different ""energy levels"" will hate being around each other, because they don't feel in sync. It also means people tend to bleed into each other's trip, which can build up to cause the infamous

* ""Resonance Cascade"". From the corner of his eye, one dude sees a creature in a bush. Now someone else does. Now the third guy is convinced he sees it too. OH SHIT, THERE IS SOMETHING IN THE BUSH. Panic ensues, causing a great deal of discomfort for all involved and pulling the group further and further into the realm of primal fear that is a true bad trip. This epic example of trip-bleeding and mass failure of group synergy at exactly the wrong time has put the kibosh on acid for many a fledgling psychonaut. Even for the seasoned few, it can *really* ruin your day and possibly the rest of the week. This is why I personally consider it to be by far the worst thing one can encounter on a trip (that can be directly attributed to acid, that is).

On the other hand, when tripping alone:

* Thought loops happen quite frequently, but you drift in and out of them as if they were never there. I'm generally very surprised when I'm able to notice that I'm in one, because without a reason to talk, the only way I could detect it myself is by listening to my incredibly frazzled and jumpy inner voice and trying to look for a pattern. *However*, when I happened to fall into one during a facebook-chat, it became glaringly obvious. The chat box became rife with ""I still don't see how that applies to what I said before,"" and I grew nervous.

* Without communication, you've no way to notice the thought-hitches that acid brings on. Instead of stressing out over a couple words on the tip of your tongue, you'll completely lose your train of thought and space out at a lamp or flower for a few minutes.

* Without people, there is absolutely no way for a Resonance Cascade to happen. Yes, you can work yourself up into a tizzy, but you've got no outside help and it takes such a long while that you may just forget what was happening. You're literally immune to what I consider to be the worst possible thing that can happen on on acid trip.

I'd really like to hear your thoughts on this, as I only personally know one other guy who has tried solo tripping, and I feel I might be able to help my friends if this ends up being true.",,False,,t5_2qhvj,False,,,True,t3_1jy20e,http://www.reddit.com/r/LSD/comments/1jy20e/thoughts_on_solo_tripping_and_bad_trips/,

I'm in a big mess and need other people knowledge.  
To put it in a nutshell. last week it was my birthday. I decided to take some tabs with friends. It was the first time for two of them.  
At first everything was pretty cool. But soon, one of the two girls for whom it was the first time freaked out. Soon the second one freaked out too. We were at my place.  
They were getting aggressive, speaking in their own language (they are foreigners), and I couldn't stop them to go outside my place. Without even shoes.  
They walked in Tokyo for hours. At night they came back to my place and explained to me that they have been to the cops during their bad trip. And that the cops took their urine. They have my address.

What do you guys think of this situation? Am I fucked?

Some important points:
- It was one week ago now and I still have no signs of the cops. The girls neither.  
- They said to them that it's gonna take one month for the urine test. Seems bullshit to me, I don't get it.  They can't find anything after so long.
- The girls didn't mention the name of the substance. They just said ""he gave me a tiny paper I put in my mouth""  
- The cops bring back the two girls by car to my place that night. Wy did they do that? Why didn't they act quickly and find me? Are they waiting to get more elements on me or something?

Four months ago, I dropped for my first time. It was an amazing experience. Afterwards I felt different (I experienced a paradigm shift), and I came to /r/lsd to ask for help to try to figure things out. You guys helped me out a lot, told me that what I was going through was normal and that I would feel better and return back to normalcy. (Also someone had suggested I check back in in a month never got around to it so here I am now)

Since my trip I have had a lot of fun, and I've changed a lot too. I can't exactly explain how(I'm about to try though). But I defineatly feel that I've become a better person. That's not to say I was a bad person before, but I've become a lot more motivated to DO SOMETHING with my life. Before I was unmotivated, lazy, never really left my house, or did much of anything. All of that has changed. In a comment in my previous post said ""You're an adult now"" I can't say that's completely true, I'm still a teenager that has fun and does what us teenagers do. But I'm more mature, well more mature than I would have been with out experiencing LSD.

One thing I'm unsure about is that I've grown apart from my friend who made sure I didn't do anything stupid whilst tripping. He was my best friend before, but now we hang out once every two weeks (at most), where we used to hang out near constantly.

After I dropped, time moved slowly, I felt everyone looked at me differently, I hated to be alone, and I didn't know if I was glad that I felt different or not. Now the days are flying by again, I don't see anything wrong with the way people look at me, I spend time alone with out batting an eye, and I don't feel different; I feel like me.

tl;dr Dropped acid, experienced paradigm shift, was unsure about it, feel great now

I am seeking my first psychedelic experience and was convinced shrooms would be the best bet, however after some reading I am thinking possibly a low dose of LSD. Ignore the parts that say shrooms, I hope this isnt considered spam.

So I am fairly certain I have the answers I have been looking for, however I just want to verify them because I am anal retentive like that. I read everywhere that I shouldn't do shrooms if I am the slightest bit unhappy. Everyone talks about how enlightening they feel and how opened their eyes are etc after doing things like shrooms and even MDMA.

I am under the impression that it will take something almost psychedelic, for a lack of a better word, to get me out of the rut I am stuck in.

I over think everything in my life.

I have an amazing wife, and that's all I should really need.

However I let my hatred for my job, where we live, our lack of money, our falling apart house, my jealousy and my insecurity take over my life. I want all of those feelings to go away, however it is not simply a flip of a switch. I want to get out of my body for a day and just let myself be free from all of this bullshit and just see things differently. I also have a negative thought or two about my wife now and again. Would these come out if I had her as a spotter?

I can rationalize how differently I should think, eat, act however I don't do it. For whatever reason knowing what I should be doing, and actually doing it aren't happening. I think ultimately, and truthfully, I feel as though I will never genuinely be happy unless I have some form of experience. No matter how good it gets for me, I also find something to drag it down. I've never not been like that, and I seek the ""drug"" for my ""ailment"".

Based on everything that is wrong with me, and what I have read, doing shrooms would make things worse. Is this assumption correct?

I took one tab and I gave her a tab that was cut roughly 3/4s the size of mine. 

   From my experience it was pretty strong; I dont know the amount in micrograms, but I was feeling funny after only half an hour, and hallucinating after an hour. After roughly three hours I was getting more ""advanced"" hallucinations, like ""holograms"" floating around the air that I could push around by waving my arms. 

   My friend started hallucinating after an hour, and her trip seemed to progress more rapidly than mine; although she never had the same level of hallucinations that I had. She mostly saw only basic hallucinations such as color vibrancy and visual distortions; but enjoyed herself alot. 

   Then after around 5 hours right around my peak she tells me she felt completely sober. All effects seemed to fade away within an hour. I continued tripping for around another 6 hours before I could fall asleep. Judging from what she was describing, I felt as if she had an intense but very short trip. 
 
   The next day, she told me even though she was completely sober after the short trip, she felt that she couldnt sleep (and had tons of energy to study/work) for the next 7 hours.

  I'm still puzzled as to why her trip lasted only 5 hours, whereas I took only a slightly larger dose and had a full blown 12 hour trip. She's never had any medication, no family history of mental illness - nothing out of the usual. 

  The only physical difference I could think of is that shes heavier than me and she drinks ALOT of water. I've known a few dozen people that have tripped, and I've never seen anyone's trip suddenly cut short like that.

  It also couldn't have been uneven doses in the blotter paper because I saw for myself the sheet where it was cut from; both our squares were near each other in the same corner.

 She mentioned that before she's taken shrooms before, and a couple times they had no effect on her at all; if shes just naturally resistant to psychedelics then there's really nothing I could do. Has anyone had experiences like this?

But having said that, not every trip is that fantastic. I usually really really dislike my peaks. In fact, I've never had a very enjoyable peak. It's usually pretty overwhelming and freaky to me. 

Every time I take a hallucinogen and start to peak, I always remember why I don't like the peaks. Beforehand, I would think to myself 'I can handle it this time!', but then every time I peak, I say to myself I shouldn't trip again. So, I usually tend to freak out a little bit during my peaks. Only on a couple of occasions have I actually **freaked** out in which I needed the assistance of others, but in every peak I get scared and my heart races and I get awkward and I need to leave where I'm at. I usually trip in pretty comfortable environments too, so that isn't the cause. I just get very introverted and the thoughts I get are often very scary and pessimistic and paranoid. After the peak though, I have a phenomenal time, and I remember why I love tripping so much and why I want to continue tripping! I've just had a couple of very bad peaks, and now whenever I drop LSD, I always get scared beforehand because I'm so afraid of the peak, which basically sets me up to have a bad time if I'm going into it all scared. 

I love tripping, though; I love experiencing and alternate method of perception and unleashing all the secret's of the brains capabilities. I just usually get very uncomfortable during peak. Any advice anyone? Any advice on how to turn my mindset around during my peak? I know they say to 'just go with it', but sometimes it's harder than that. I'm usually with people I really am comfortable with and in a comfortable environment, so that stuff doesn't much play a factor. I think it really is just an internal thing within me that causes me to bad trip, but that isn't to say I don't think I can change that.

For a school assignment my topic is LSD. Its not an extremely in depth assignment just plenty of general information and facts about the drug such as;The short term effects of using this drug ,The long term effects of using this drug, Medical uses, past or present (if any), Laws concerning the control of this drug ect. The reason I came here to ask is that hopefully you guys would know the places with the best information and correct facts cause I got into an argument with my teacher who was saying LSD is a dangerous drug and will just completely mess you up no matter what even if you have a good trip and that there is no medical uses for it according to her. This annoyed me cause I know she is not entirely correct so I chose LSD to hopefully open my teachers eyes with some correct information and facts that I can reference and possibly prove her wrong. I myself have never taken LSD but it is something I wish to experience atleast once.

Because it helps you learn a lot about yourself, things that you wouldn't usually think about, to come to certain realisations about your life, a better understanding and to help you admire things more and to be more thankful?

Or do you take it because you hate reality, and taking acid is just a perfect escape from it all...

At the moment for me it's a reality thing... or maybe a bit of both. But mostly the whole wanting to escape the shit that is my life at the moment.
This doesn't put me into a bad trip as much, I took acid yesterday and I'm generally at an all time low in my life, but yet I still managed to enjoy it and the beauty/complexity of it all, helped me momentarily forget the bad things that have been going on.
I know it's a bad idea to take LSD when you feel SHIT about life, but I did it and I'm ok, nothing horrible happened. (guess that in a way shows that despite all the crap that is going on inside my head, I still have the mental strength to pull through it or not think about it at all)

We meet my other two friends on the train to the club.

Once we get to the club we realised how packed its going to be and I am a little nervous. so its 10:30pm and I drop my tab, listening to the sydney djs that are the supporting acts, they gave it their best and were amazing I suggest if you are australian if you get the chance check out minx, she is an amazing dj! at 11:30 I'm starting to come up quickly from the tab so i drop my cap of molly about 0.1 grams. standing infront of the sound booth just dancing a little to Minx going to the bar and back to get water for my brother and I. 

Finally at 12:30 am Madeon arrives and busts out some heavy tunes! By this time I am overwhealmed by the euphoria music is sounding amazing and my molly and lsd are peaking perfectly in sync, my eyes rolling back in my head and lots of OEV""s as well and some CEV's! 

This is his [**opening**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNzWPwDeYW8&amp;hd=1), This is [**Shuriken live**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_bsJYa2lWU&amp;hd=1), then he drop this bomb shell you will all remember from fifa 98 [**Woo Hoo**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jl7v-0gZD2g), by now he is half way through his set and its 1:00 and I'm still peaking hard! when he decides to drop [**the island remix**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-13agoYwLuw&amp;hd=1), and [**que vuex-tu**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_YKMXJ4sIA&amp;hd=1) After this I stop recording songs to enjoy my self a little until he plays his last song and I thought I must capture this beauty first hand! he does his little launch pad set up and give his master piece [**Pop culture**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIfsU-A5wcs&amp;hd=1)! At 1:30 am it is now very hot inside and as you can see very packed. I think without the mdma I would have freaked by now. I've been chewing some gum to cope with the teeth grinding.

Minx comes back on for 20 minutes as Avicii is a little late, I level out at this point but still tripping and feeling very euphoric, Then at 1:50 am Avcii come on and I drop my second and last cap of molly 0.1 grams, to keep me going through the rest of the night. Avicii is amazing as usual I ask my brother how he is feeling and he tells me ""Dude this night is the best night I have ever gone out to!"" he has been clubbing and raving for 8 years fyi. 

Then about half way through Avicii's set 2:40 I start peaking off my other pill, this is not as hard as before and a little more easy to handle.
This is perfect timing as he drops one of my favourite songs and mash up of the two songs my brother had at his wedding ceremony, [**Tim berg - bromance (Avicii arena remix) and Axwells - I found you then into Tim berg - Seek bromance!**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e38ynBiMeAg&amp;hd=1) These song's are special to both of us as my brothers wedding was one of the last good times I spent with my mum who died of cancer only 6 months ago. Music Brings back memories for me. After this song I gave the lighting guy a massive high five for the awesome work he had been doing with the lasers. Anything to make someones day a little bit better :D. 

Avicii goes onto play another hour after this pumping out so many great songs with flawless mixing! One of Aviciis Last songs was this awesome mash up! I wasnt able to record it but i found somone else who did on youtube that night [**Avicii - Levels That I Used To Know**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2zKNmKBGWg&amp;hd=1) After Avcii's set finishes for some reason I start peaking again, I have been told this molly has a phantom 2nd coming and I got it and am now tripping hard and feeling amazing again, my mate found my brother and I just on avicii's last song. He had been hooking up with a chick around the corner! I gave him a big high five. I went outside and found my other mate who had freaked out during Avicii's set and had to leave, and then we headed to macca's. 
I couldn't eat much so I just had half a cheese burger, then we went to the station and went home. I really wanted to go venturing around the city but the rest of my mates just wanted to go home. when we got back I ate a little more. I had a little bit of trouble sleeping during the day, but during the night I got some good sleep.

Last night was my year's formal afterparty, and while I was a drunk as a skunk I decided to talk to the DJ's who were casually doing lines of coke on their decks. They asked me if I wanted a line and I declined. One of the DJ's have been asking my friends if they wanted some mushrooms and other substances.

As you can probably tell, nobody slept last night and most of us just watched the sun rise. I noticed that both the DJ's were squirming around on the floor occasionally kicking their legs. Which I can only assume was the combination of the drugs they took?

I approached them this morning and asked them when their next show was, he told me and then and he did acid before they packed up. He explained the pleasantries of acid. 

Today I watched [Diggnation #0333](http://revision3.com/diggnation/googlemaps) and they talked about Steve Jobs and LSD. Glenn McElhose noted that LSD isn't as bad as people make it out to be and said that there have been no deaths or addiction to it. 

There is so much propaganda on cannabis that I'm actually not inclined to listen to any statistics. The negative stigma on drugs also doesn't help when you see footage of people doing stupid things while on it.

TL;TR I would like to hear from the users of LSD:

* What are you experiences with it?
* Are there any precautions you should take?
* How do you tell the difference between a dodgy batch of LSD or not?

That's all the questions I can think of.

For those i can remember, i'll describe the feeling behind them.

* 'someone entering the room' - i had this feeling all night, either someone entering my field of view, or someone of neutral nature i didn't know was present in the room with us

* 'urge to feel smaller'

* 'make others from memory'

* 'mind gets constructive'

* 'more sauber, more egocentrical'

* 'stand-up in front of own confidence'

* 'eyes looking, jaws opening' - this is about a trippy d'n'b video we watched, i was seeing eyes and jaws for another period of time (no idea how long it was in real time). quite interesting feeling.

* 'time for adventure 5' - i'm one of those who spend lots of their trip or 'shroom time doing things everyone says not to do. this case is about locking myself in the bathroom and staring into a mirror (for the fifth time)

* 'decreasing or increasing?' - after ages (that's how i felt), i wasn't sure if the trip is getting stronger or weaker for a short time

* 'perspective: i'll never know' - had very good revelation, wrote down 'perspective:' and forgot the rest of it

* 'second worth a day' - don't need to explain do i?

* 'vision has kinetic effects' - related to a visual hallucination that triggered series of kinetic hallucinations

* 'charlie is educated voter' - was watching first episode of charlie the unicorn, when i realized that charlie is skeptical and capable of critical thinking - qualities that people with right to vote should have

* 'time for num.6' - explained above

* 'i think i wanna be a writer' - last thought of the night (already day actually)

A good (separate) friend of mine recommended this place and mentioned I could find some here.  I've never done this before, my previous experiences are limited to a small stint with the green, and last weekend's molly (amazing)

The good trip was just like anyone else would describe a good shrooms trip, and the bad one seems to have been what I've learned to be an ""ego death"". Though I feel that the ego death trip was brought on more so by my anxiety than anything else.

Basically I felt completely detached from all reality, and could not comprehend anything about my life. my name, where I was, what my purpose was, what year it was were all gone. I couldn't comprehend other people, or people in general. Society as a whole seemed to be some strange fantasy. Anytime I tried to think about anything, I was bombarded with confusion and anxiety. I was lost in my mind, and I began to think of myself as insane. I thought I had gone permanently insane and would be this way forever (whatever forever was anyway).

Along with this, came the feeling of being trapped, and being IMMENSLY uncomfortable. I had the unwavering need to get somewhere where I could be comfortable (I was in Washington, DC on the national mall admiring the monuments with my friends). I felt that no matter what I did, I couldn't manage to get somewhere were I was comfortable, or where I belonged. It turned out to be one of the most fearful experiences of my life. I found myself curled up in a ball on a park bench when the trip started to subside. All I remember of this portion (being curled up on the bench) is thinking that death was imminent, and that my insanity completely overcame me.

Anyway, after that experience, I was hesitant to try shrooms again, so when I did, I only ate 1 g, and didnt feel much. I haven't done it since.

I have heard from my friends (the definition of seasoned drug users) that acid is a lot more mellow and in control. The analogy one of them used was ""You do acid. Shrooms do you."" Judging by that I feel like I'd be much better off doing Acid if I would have a tendancy to bring negative feelings and anxiety into the trip. I've also heard that you should always keep some benzo's on hand when tripping because taking them will end the trip/erase bad thoughts. Maybe even, for me at least, it would be better to take a benzo BEFORE I trip to prevent it from happening in the first place?

What do you guys think? Should I try Acid? Maybe 1 hit to start? ",,False,,t5_2qhvj,False,,,True,t3_fm90w,http://www.reddit.com/r/LSD/comments/fm90w/had_a_bad_shroom_trip_should_i_try_acid/,

Also I really appreciate any feedback or comments, whether it be from the science side or the drug culture side.

I just thought it might be relevant to add that at the time I wrote this essay, I had never tried acid. I was very interested in it but wanted to know more, and researching and writing this essay helped make my mind up. I still consider the trip that followed to be one of my favorite experiences.

I had done psilocybin mushrooms before and always had a great time but for some reason my LSD trip went differently. After feeling the effects only 20 minutes after taking the tabs I grew more and more anxious. As the effects intensified I began to entirely loose my sense of reality. During my trip I actually began to harm myself and a few of my sober friends ended up calling 911 (being sent to the hospital may have not been the best thing in the end as it was quite frightening). The cognitive side of my trip was actually quite enlightening and perspective changing but the fact that my reality entirely fell apart makes me very nervous to ever try psychedelics again. I later found out that the tabs I ingested were each 100ug (I took 2) which may have been why I had such an intense experience. I would like to trip again (at a lower dose of course) but I am very nervous of having a similar experience.

An old roommate of mine from college (we're both 21 now) happens to be back in town and we're going to take LSD for the first time together. We lived together freshman year so we trust the shit out of each other I'd say.

We both have smoked quite a bit in the past but have never done any hallucinogens though have contemplated for a while. Long story short he finally came across some from a friend (he says it is reliable) and we are ready to take it. I've read tons of resources over the past year or so and feel like I know most of what to expect. 

Unfortunately, (I didn't know he had it all along till now otherwise i would have said something to him) he has been carrying the hits around (wrapped) in his wallet... I am kind of shocked at how one could be so thoughtless about it but that's why he is my best friend. Anyway, he think we should take the whole tabs at once - not sure on what the dosage may be around especially given the storage...

Should we just take the whole tabs at one time or should we split them up by about an hour? Any of your other thoughts or wisdom is welcome! We have a great number of vinyls including Abbey Road and Revolver. :)
