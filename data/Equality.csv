They also point out that women are viewed more highly the fewer # of sexual partners they've had... but I've never seen them make the connection that, likewise, men are viewed as less desirable and stigmatized for having few, or god help them, no sexual partners.  In fact, I often see them accuse those they disagree with of being virgins who couldn't possibly get girlfriends.

1. Isn't this equivalent to slut shaming, thus revealing a double standard that its okay to judge a male's sex life but not a woman's?

2. Doesn't this assume heterosexuality as the default as the underlying assumption is that every man wants to have sexual relations with a female?

3. Doesn't this suggest that a man's worth as a human being is determined by how sexually interested women are in him?

4. So does that mean the more women you've had sex with, the better a person you must be?

5.  If a woman needs a man 'like a fish needs a bicycle', why is a man without a girlfriend something shameful, worthy of derision, and evidence of significant personality flaws?

6. If they don't think misogynistic people get laid and society is patriarchal, how do they think we've been repopulating all these years?",,False,,t5_2qtp5,True,,,True,t3_kikvf,http://www.reddit.com/r/Equality/comments/kikvf/virgin_shaming_male_version_of_slut_shaming/,

This question contained one of the things that bothers me the most about people that seek racial equality. She told the woman that had come to speak that teachers were giving white students better grades than black students. This bothered me for two reasons. First of all, most of my black friends, including myself, have very good GPAs which we had  to put in a good deal of effort to recieve. Second of all, this girl is not very smart. It may sound rude, but she has English at a lower level than some exchange students here, and she makes no effort to improve her grades. 

She, and other black girls at the school also have the habit of saying that a teacher ""gave"" them grades. To clear things up, I am not sexist, but the black boys do not do this as often. On top of that, I realize that other people say that teachers ""give"" them grades, but these girls blame their scores on their teachers not their own work. In addition, they blame their teacher's motivation on their race.

I've pointed out the flaws in their thinking to them, but they went to the dean of students of all people, and I was threatened with suspension for harassment. They also called me ignorant, as if they were seeing something I don't.

To bring this full circle: equality does not simply rely on how society perceives a group. Sometimes oppressed groups have flaws within them. I think it is especially true for blacks that society has changed a lot to help us. With all we have been given, it is only fair that we begin to help ourselves.

Female aviators are allowed combat roles, and although female soldiers in Iraq are ostensibly removed from combat, the reality is that a great number of them are in just as much danger as men.

In America, every male above the age of 18 is legally required to register with the Selective Service System, which is a record of our names and addresses for conscription purposes. Should the country need us, myself and millions of my peers could be mobilized in a matter of weeks to fight (and, presumably, die) overseas. (In case you're wondering, it sucks, but I'd do it.) Women have never been required to register for the SSS. Should they be? On the battlefield, they have accepted the same risk as men; why should they be excluded on the basis of sex from the draft?

I'm torn on this issue; on one hand, equality seems to dictate that the draft be sex-blind. On the other, I think we've long accepted the fact that women are simply more important than men when it comes to keeping a society alive. Historically, women have been kept alive over men in times of stress (see the Titanic, Haiti, etc. I don't have more examples, but those two are enough for me). I agree with the argument that when it comes down to it, a woman's life is more valuable than mine for the long-term survival of my civilization. I don't know if I can accept this as a justification for only drafting men, however.

I love the balance of articles and bringing up issues that I never would have noticed or thought about. It has really helped me broaden my knowledge of the world and help others understand the issues that affect true equality in the world.

However, too often lately I have seen threads be flooded by arguments over, ""I know you brought up this issue, but there is another group that is affected by something just as bad! Focus on this!"" Yes, there will always be others who are suffering, but create a different thread if you wish to bring light to an issue you care about. Don't push it in a thread about another subject. If someone talks about gender discrimination against women, don't start ranting about how men are discriminated against too. You diminish the purpose of the thread, and if anything make others shy away from discussing the issue by making it a clusterfuck discussion. That is why discussion forums have threads, so you can seperate each issue so that it will promote a discussion.

I just had an unpleasant exchange with someone who was very stubborn in their refusal to admit that its not ok to say how men should and shouldn't be, and to define what a real man is.

[here is the link](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1bhsj8/females_of_reddit_what_visual_cues_indicate_to/c96ty7c)

I feel like this happens all the time, like people dont take this issue seriously, and like people feel they can say anything they want about men, and to men.

I especially feel like we are not afforded the right to define ourselves as individuals or as a gender, nor are we ever free from the restrictive ideas and expectations set on us by women (and other genders)....and by men and women who try to define being male in reference to how women view us, how how we effect women, and how we interact with them.

(here I am referring to how men are described as good or bad purely based on how they treat women, the male identity and the associated male roles are often described by how we interact with women (protector, predator, rapist, breadwinner, womanizer)

And this is accepted as fine by almost everyone, even while we are fighting against the cultural tendency to do this to women.  We are fighting for women to be able to define themselves as individuals and as a gender on their own terms, not just by how men view them.

Anyway I am feeling pretty pessimistic about this, and I am hoping that you guys have lots of insight that will make me feel better about where we are in dealing with male gender roles in society.",,False,,t5_2qtp5,1365261340.0,,,True,t3_1brsup,http://www.reddit.com/r/Equality/comments/1brsup/people_are_unwilling_to_admit_that_it_isnt_ok_to/,

The videos, though clearly racist and sexist for the most part go unchecked. There are black men who are quick to join in on the finger pointing of black women in an attempt to lift themselves while vilifying us. It is disgusting. I've never intentionally brought harm to a stranger. Never robbed anyone. Never verbally harassed anyone. Yet there are [a lot of these comments](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_Uok5V01dw) directed at me, asking me to take responsibility for what a few strangers from a state that I have never been to have done.

I used to think that prejudice was limited to the uneducated or stupid. But I've come to see that even those considered to be intellectuals are just as prone. I now attribute it to weakness. Because it takes an incredibly strong mind to overcome the desire to hate and judge those from the same race as someone who has hurt you in the past. I have been hurt plenty of times by whites in the past. I've been pushed down and bullied by white kids, yelled at and thrown out of a shop and was told to 'go back to my neighborhood' for making an inquiry, been told that I ""wasn't like the rest of them"" and that's just a few off the top of my head. 

I've been a fan of rock and metal since I was a preteen, and at my very first concert (Tibetan Freedom concert), the most memorable thing that day was how the other attendants made me feel. They stared at me with a worried look, didn't answer me if I tried to make conversation or said things like 'wow, you must feel out of place (haha)'. After the third band I was trying so hard to hold back tears that I couldn't really hear the music. 

Each and every time I had prejudice or racism thrown at me it hurt. Hurt like hell; still does. I'm not trying to play ""holier than thou"" but I never held it against all whites and I never would.

The fact of the matter is, if we didn't have any of you, there would be little left for people looking out for their own.

It is damn near impossible to become an activist for every issue out there, which is why I don't understand the criticism of people who join for a particular cause. If they weren't doing it, who would pay as close attention as them? It doesn't mean they don't care about the other issues, it's typically a cause they can relate to or just simply feel strongly about.

I'm going to use the Feminism/Men's Rights as examples - as it's something we can all relate as we are (assumed) one or both of these genders. We have men on one side calling out to the feminists on how much they ignore false rape claims or cases on child welfare. On the flipside, feminists will call out them men's right side by saying they are ignoring all of the rape/beatings etc. males are responsible for. I'm going to come out and say it's wrong to ignore either of these side's issues - but we need someone for both sides of the coin so we know everyone is being looked out for. So instead of trying to belittle eachother's cause saying it's not important, just keep focusing on your own problems.

The glaring problem with these movements are the extremes, which moves beyond rights and into Bigotry. We need everyone to fix their focus of fire not on eachother, but these individuals in their own movements. If someone on the male's right side tries to talk to an extreme feminist, they will simply be shot down and ignored as they are viewed as the problem (and vice versa). You need people to call out these extremists on their own side or you will keep getting ridiculed by your opponent for supporting them (""Silence is betrayal"" so to speak). 

The important step here is to **acknowledge the problems for all sides** and do your best to support one another as we are all pushing for equality. Even, say, someone were to start a ""White Right's"" movement, where the focus was on making sure the equality treatment of those who were white. I'd expect the same support from all sides, there are issues for even whites (as there are with blacks, hispanics, native americans, asians etc.), though maybe not as numerous, are still there and should not be ignored.

It's perfectly fine to admit that we are psychologically inclined to support that which we can understand and relate - this being our own race and gender. So **of course** you are going to have the majority of feminists to be female and the majority of male's right to be males. Don't let these biases get in the way of the problems we all face.

I was originally going to use examples from the subreddits /r/feminism, /r/mensrights, and /r/shitredditsays, but if you have any sense of equality and rationality, you would easily be able to identify exactly what I am talking about. This was just a tired and angry rambling as I was browsing said subreddits and became a little infuriated. (And as a little sidenote: Some of you need a serious sense of humour and identify what is/isn't sexism &amp; racism).

**TL;DR - What you are fighting for is important as there are problems all across the board. Don't belittle those of other movements because you don't think it has as high of importance. If we didn't have them, who would be looking out for them?**",,False,,t5_2qtp5,False,,,True,t3_pcz58,http://www.reddit.com/r/Equality/comments/pcz58/a_brief_open_letter_to_feminists_mens_rights/,

Everyone seemed to really enjoy it aside from a few students who found it ""offensive to actual cross-dressers."" These students complained, one thing lead to another and our principal ended up banning cross-dressing on that day. 
That day was today. The principal sent an email to every teacher telling them to send any cross-dresser to the office where they would be sent home to change. This is not okay. No where in the school code does it define what a male should wear versus what a female should wear. It should remain that way. It would simply be unethical to define genders to specific clothing in this day and age. We are supposed to be tolerant of others but I guess we can't be tolerant of cross-dressers. 

This also brings about a gender issue. I think that the students and staff who were opposed to cross dressing were specifically opposed to male cross dressing. If you think about it, females ""cross-dress"" a lot more than males, wearing baggy jeans, shirts, etc. However, if a guy puts on a dress or make-up somehow everyone is offended now. People should be more accepting of guys who want to express their selves through cross-dressing!

However, if sexual intercourse results in an unplanned pregnancy, then why should only the woman have a say in how the fetus should be handled?

For instance, from what I understand, the current situation is as follows:

1. If a man wants the baby, but the woman doesn't, then the woman can abort.

2. If a man doesn't want the baby, but the woman does, then the man has to pay child support.

This doesn't seem fair at all. **Of course, some might say that reproductive duties aren't fair to begin with.** However, what about the beginning of the pregnancy when a woman might not be able to claim that she has been affected any worse than the man?

What about finding a suitable definition for 'early pregnancy', keeping the woman's right to abort, but changing the second scenario to:

* If a man doesn't want the baby, but the woman does, then the man can petition within early pregnancy to be absolved of child support. Also, if the woman hides the fact that she's pregnant, then a man should be able to sue for fraud (or some more proper term) to be absolved of child support.

What do you think?

&gt; **On what grounds can he be absolved?**

The same grounds on which a woman can choose to be absolved of the baby: Reproductive freedom.

&gt; **In what situations can't he be absolved?**

I suppose after he has already agreed to have officially 'adopted' the child, or if the woman can show that the man made no attempt to absolve himself some sufficient time before 'late pregnancy' (whatever that means, as determined by law).

An interesting corner case is when the man and woman might plan to conceive and then the man gets cold feet. In this case, it seems that the woman should be able to sue for fraud (or some more appropriate term) in order to force child support for an already conceived child.

Another interesting (and perhaps exactly analogous) corner case is when the woman tells the man that she's on birth control but actually is not (or she uses his semen later). In this case, the man could sue for fraud (or some more appropriate term) in order to absolve himself of child support.

I guess the point is this: If you want a clear legal situation, it's important to declare beforehand that you choose to have a child together (in fact, *I* would call that 'marriage'). Then, along these lines, the 'early pregnancy' would serve as a 'grace period' for couples that conceive by mistake without fraud.",,False,,t5_2qtp5,True,,,True,t3_aqj5t,http://www.reddit.com/r/Equality/comments/aqj5t/defining_a_mans_right_to_choose/,

1353824724.0,36,self.Equality,13r10c,So I just learned about a subreddit that has me a bit concerned...,62,26,56,http://www.reddit.com/r/Equality/comments/13r10c/so_i_just_learned_about_a_subreddit_that_has_me_a/,"It's called /r/againstmensrights, and while I'm sure it's specifically targeted towards the infamous men's rights subreddit /r/mensrights, the title of the subreddit and the nature of many of the posts has me rather bothered and concerned as to what's happened to feminism.

Feminism has always seemed like a good idea to me, but I've always kept my distance from calling myself a feminist, as I believe that it unnecessarily puts preference on the issues that face women and in many cases can foster ignorance towards issues facing men, playing them off as irrelevant.

This subreddit is the incarnation of that belief, but with just as much hatred and loathing as mensrights is known to be capable of. It really worries me that in the pursuit of making women and men equal in society, we've grown afraid of one gender being more equal than the other, and have split into these petty factions of ""he's versus she's"", like it's some sort of school yard game.

I wanna know if I'm the only one who feels this way about /r/againstmensrights, and if there's anything we can do to help people in both subreddits realize that the path of equality can be peaceful, egalitarian, and cooperative, and that the issues of men, women, and other gender identities are important, no matter who the person, because none of us choose who we are.",,False,,t5_2qtp5,False,,,True,t3_13r10c,http://www.reddit.com/r/Equality/comments/13r10c/so_i_just_learned_about_a_subreddit_that_has_me_a/,

1269414814.0,36,self.Equality,bhhmh,Feminism != Egalitarianism,56,20,99,http://www.reddit.com/r/Equality/comments/bhhmh/feminism_egalitarianism/,"I am a strong believer in egalitarianism, and I've read several arguments on reddit from women pressing that feminism is a more appropriate term than egalitarianism because it reflects the history of that movement and what it means for social justice.

This post is mainly to say that, no, feminism is *not* equal to egalitarianism. The first entry for feminism on dictionary.com (http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/feminism) says ""the doctrine advocating social, political, and all other rights of women equal to those of men,"" which places men on a pedestal as a shining example of what could be while ignoring gender-related issues on the other side of the fence. This is not egalitarianism. Merriam-webster's (http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/feminism) first entry does say ""the theory of the political, economic, and social equality of the sexes,"" but its second entry is ""organized activity on behalf of women's rights and interests,"" which is so far from the first entry that I'm just left even more confused about what the definition should be, and if feminism can be equal to one or the other then the term is too ambiguous to have any practical value.

I have no problem with feminism. The movement has made great strides for people who have historically been in a disadvantaged position in terms of economic success and political influence. But I simply can't agree with anyone who says that the feminist movement is pushing for men's rights as well, thus bridging the gender gap. Some successes of the movement benefit men as well, but the *focus* of the movement doesn't even have men on the radar.

So, I am an egalitarian, and though there is no strong ""egalitarian"" movement that I am aware of, I hope some supporters of feminism will acknowledge that the term is less than man-friendly, and that those who support men's issues will admit to themselves that they are an egalitarian as well and not solely a feminist.

Thank you. That is all.

EDIT: To clarify a bit. This topic is not meant to argue about the semantics of the feminist movement and who is which type of feminist, but rather to point out and criticize the ambiguity of the term ""feminism.""",,False,,t5_2qtp5,True,,,True,t3_bhhmh,http://www.reddit.com/r/Equality/comments/bhhmh/feminism_egalitarianism/,

(2) Do you think that contraception should be readily available for all women? Should companies pay for it through their insurances?

(3) Do you think there is sexism in videogames? What about movies?

(4) Do you agree with affirmative action? Does it still have a place in society for women?

(5) Do you think that abortion should be readily available to all women?

(6) Should women have the first and final say about abortion?

(7) Do you think that poor single mom's should be given assistance from the government?

(8) What do you think the number one threat to the equality of women is?


I just wanted to hear everyone's opinion, because sometimes this subreddit can be a bit disheartening. I see the word misandry thrown around a lot more than misogyny (not that it's a contest) to the point where I feel that women can't really even fully talk about ideas of equality for themselves.

1308343803.0,37,self.Equality,i2fyf,"I just did a little research into government funding toward men and toward women, and the numbers are pretty interesting (although not that surprising)",47,10,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/Equality/comments/i2fyf/i_just_did_a_little_research_into_government/,"I volunteer for a men's resource centre, and one of the things they asked me to do was figure out how much money the province was dedicating to men's resources as opposed to women's resources (I'm in Canada, btw). I just finished, and the numbers are pretty interesting...

In 2009/2010 it was $1,516,460 toward men and $57,562,373 toward women. In 2010/2011 it was $3,740,800 toward men and $48,331,443 toward women. 

In 2008/2009 the province dedicated $561,360 toward men's resources and $98,983,236 toward women's resources. The inflated numbers for women's funding for this year are due to more gender-specific funding toward ending domestic violence. Both 2009/2010 and 2010/2011 had funding toward ending domestic violence that was close to on par with the previous year, but the news releases were quite vague and it was impossible to determine to whom that funding actually went. The numbers for the latter two fiscal years are lower for women's resources because of this. Also, in the latter two fiscal years the province started a Provincial Homelessness Initiative. Under this, more funding has gone toward shelters that house both men and women and more funding has been handed out in the form of low-interest mortgages rather than grants.

It's interesting to note that the funding has increased quite substantially year by year for men, and I think this is a good sign. Unfortunately, the numbers are still incredibly lopsided, and men (in my province, at least) seem to be getting the short end of the stick.

Most of the funding for women went to shelters, transition houses, and housing for low-income women and single mothers. For men, the majority of the funding was dedicated toward addiction and recovery centres. 

I know as a receptionist at the resource centre I see a great deal of helplessness and desperation. Sometimes there is anger and resentment. I volunteer for the men's resource centre because I was in a horribly abusive relationship for years. My ex husband was raised in a family where this sort of behaviour was typical - commended, even. His upbringing did him a disservice, and I want people like him to have resources available to them (such as counselling) that might help them change their attitudes toward women. I also volunteer because my current partner was in an abusive relationship for many years and he had no resources and no one to talk to about it. He had no viable escape plan. People don't seem to take it seriously when women abuse men, and that's not fair.

I'm not sure what the solution is. Certainly men need more resources available to them. More programs for fathers, more transition houses for men fleeing abusive relationships, and more access to affordable counselling services. That said, the shelters and transition houses and so on that are currently available to women need to continue to have access to funding so that they can remain operational. How can this problem be solved when there is only so much money to go around?

Today my boss decided to use my image as a promotional tool. This is not my job. I have signed no release. 

I am a full time editor at a small Production company. I have a BFA in Film and have worked here for almost two years, making me one of the most senior members of the editing staff.  With this comes a heavy workload, and a lot of responsibility. 

Repeatedly, in the last two years, I have been asked to walk my bosses dog, or get coffee, or pick up everyones lunches. When I was the newest member of the team, this seemed fair. It is a regular part of the job of a Production Assistant, and I was happy to have the work. But that is no longer my position at this company, and as an editor with a product deadline to meet, I don't have time for this. We currently have several production assistants whose job this is. But I continue to be asked to perform these tasks.

I have also been directed to be in promotional media from time to time. This includes having my picture in newspaper articles, and acting in pilots for new products. I have represented the company several times in this way. I am the only editor ever told to do this. We do have talent that we hire on an as needed bases, who may be more appropriate to this kind of promotional piece, and who are paid for the use of their image. 

Perhaps you think I should be flattered. You would be wrong.  I am the only young female at this production company. THIS SHOULD MAKE NO DIFFERENCE IN HOW I AM TREATED.

I have never been ASKED to participate in these shoots. I have not been paid for the use of my image. My time, which is needed for the editing projects I was hired to complete, is never considered.  

Today I had an extra heavy workload. But when my boss arrived at work I clearly overhead him discussing, with my fellow co-worker, how I was to act in a promotional commercial. After I overhear this conversation about me, my boss (the CEO of the company) walk by my office with a simple “hi”. 

Despite being one of the most senior editors at this company, I was not consulted on my part in this project. I was not ASKED. 

Later the CEO wanders into my office to borrow some push-pins from my bulletin board. I have decided I have had enough and that I am not ok with being used in things that are far outside my job description, without my consent. I confront my boss. I tell him that I wished to be ASKED when these projects arise, and that my time was very constrained today. I pointed out that there were many other employees with lighter workloads, that could participate in this side project. 

My bosses response was that because I was the most “attractive” employee he had chosen me to be in this commercial. My response : “ That is misogynistic, and unwelcome”. 

This is when I was told to have a private conversation with the CEO. Behind a closed door, in the meeting room, he explained to me about how we valued “teamwork” here, and that he didn't like having employees with “bad attitudes”. 

I responded saying that if he was ASKING me to perform in this promotional piece based on my acting ability, or based on the amount of free time I had after completing my regular work, it might be appropriate. Appropriate to ASK, not assume. His response was to make it clear that no acting ability was needed, and that I was selected because I was “attractive”. He told me that he did not care if I found this offensive. He then proceeded to tell me that my workplace was not a democracy but a “Kingdom”. He pointed out that since he had used my image in the local newspaper last week that it made sense to use my image again. He had not ASKED to use my image in the paper. This is not a good reason for him to feel he has continued access to the use of my image without my consent. It is an extremely poor justification.

His next words were very carefully selected. “Those who don’t have an attitude of teamwork at this company, will not be eligible for advancement, and may find themselves not employed here anymore.” It was a clear threat to my job, but worded in such a way that there wasn't much to report to HR. He gave himself deniability, while making it clear that I had no choice in the use of my image, and no foothold in fighting against his sexual harassment. 

He then gave me a halfhearted “This isn't in your job description, so you don’t HAVE to do it.” He knew he had backed me into a corner. He would have my image, without my consent, or he would take away my livelihood. 

I weakly reiterated to him that I wished to be ASKED in the future. I wanted him to realize that the use of my image in his side projects should not be assumed. But I felt frightened and defeated. 

As my co-worker set up around me for the commercial shoot, he asked what my boss had said to me. I told him that he had threatened my job if I did not participate in this commercial. My co-worker did not seem surprised. I said “well I think we will see what HR has to say about this”. But my co-worker shot this idea down. “Do you really want to make waves?” he askes me. He reminds me of a former employee who was suddenly fired on a whim from the CEO. “We have a pretty easy gig here,” he tells me “and there will be guys like this CEO everywhere”. 

I then told him something that I think the whole world needs to hear. Yes, right now there are people who think they can manipulate, and threaten their way into what they want. They think they are entitled to anything they want from their employees. They are sure, that with a little pushing, and by instilling a little fear, they can have all the control. 

This can only happen if we allow it to. These people can only act this way if we let them. We can only be trod upon and frightened if we allow it. With an attitude of “There is no place else that would be different or better” and “ It is safer to be quiet and give them what they want” we lose our humanity, and give up our power and control. 

But I am not just an “attractive woman”. I am an educated film editor, who has consistently met deadlines and performed above expectations. I am strong and smart and experienced. I should not have anyone who thinks they can trod on me, or make me feel threatened in my life. 

Today starts my job hunt.  I’m seeking a new team. Not a “Kingdom”, but a safe and welcoming workplace that will treat me like an experienced editor, and a human being. I am not object to look pretty in commercials I will not be taken advantage of. I am not here to fulfill every whim that strikes my bosses fancy. 

I want to work for a functioning company with morals. Not a Kingdom. 

Edit: I think some people are missing the most important thing here. He wasn't threatening my job because I protested being in his stupid commercial. It was once I told him that calling me ""attractive"" was UNWELCOME that he shut us in the meeting room and started threatening my job, while asserting that he didn't care if I was offend by being called ""attractive"". And that IS sexual Harassment. He made it clear that ""Being a team player"" meant allowing him to use my ""attractiveness"" to meet his promotional needs, no matter how I felt about it. And that is misogyny. ",,False,,t5_2qtp5,1360813557.0,,,True,t3_18gk7b,http://www.reddit.com/r/Equality/comments/18gk7b/fighting_for_equality_in_my_workplace_is_not_easy/,

The kidnapping is often done with the justification that the trafficking victim is substandard and deserves incapacitation, and from it and from what follows afterward will he/she derive reform.

This is because the basis and origin of the methodology of legal human trafficking associations resides in the Synanon cult

Please join our subreddit about legal human trafficking. www.reddit.com/r/troubledteens
(I hope that if we can get to about 10,000 readers, increasingly, the 'powers that be' will note that ignoring (or participating in) ultimately illegal, 'legal' human trafficking will have repercussions on their careers, and the subject can begin to attain public awareness)

Please feel free to ask general questions. This evil represents the hate and bigotry of ageism taken to its grotesque, logical endpoint, a ""final solution."" Also, people over 18 are kidnapped and imprisoned by these groups, too, with some degree of regularity (though not nearly as ""legally,"" brazenly, or commonly). And they have never been criminally punished for that, either.

1361925044.0,26,self.Equality,19alvb,Part of gender equality is understanding both male and female privilege. Can anyone think of ones not on this list?,49,23,148,http://www.reddit.com/r/Equality/comments/19alvb/part_of_gender_equality_is_understanding_both/,"Much of the anger in both the feminist and men's rights camps has to do with feeling like one side's privileges are recognized while the other's aren't. The easiest way to remedy that is to recognize both. Being a man and being a woman both have advantages and disadvantages in society. Some of them are harder to change than others. But what we can all do is recognize these differences and do our best to make sure no one gets the short end of the stick because of them.

Note: *I recognize that male/female are aspects of sex, while man/woman are aspects of gender, but for the purposes of this discussion, we are referring to both perceptions of gender in society and the various maladies of one's sex. So, I did not distinguish between these two aspects.*

**Male**

* A majority of workers in many fields are male, creating feelings of social cohesion which make working in those fields easier for men

* The ability to fart/burp/etc. and have it be funny, not disgusting, esp. in media

* No need to wear makeup / not evaluated based on looks as heavily

* Can (usually) be heavy and still well-respected

* Can go shirtless in public

* Doesn't experience pain of childbirth

* Doesn't experience menstruation

* Can get angry without being asked if on one's period / without being considered ""bitchy""

* Currently makes more money on average

* Respected more as age increases, not judged by ""old"" appearance

* Given de facto preference in applications to schools and employers

* Can look to majority of figures in science and politics, both past and present, for same-sex inspiration

* Can more readily defend and/or prevent rape

* Can gain muscle mass more easily

* Can be bald and have hairier everything without criticism

* Not constantly approached / propositioned for sex/dates

**Female**

* Readily accepted for work with children, e.g. babysitters, day care providers, elementary school teachers

* Can wear makeup to improve appearance without fear of social alienation

* Can wear tight-fitting or extremely loose clothing or extremely short clothing without any consequences

* Can wear all male or female clothing, except maybe a tuxedo, without social reprisal

* Given preference in divorce court both with respect to finances and property, as well as who gets the children

* Survival is given preference in life-saving situations, e.g. Titanic, until recently the draft for wars

* Sexual attraction is not physically apparent to an observer / does not have to worry about inappropriate 
erections

* Given preference in rape cases and cases of domestic violence, usually even if perpetrator

* Can be assured of legal protection in violent disputes, even if the instigator 

* Can obsess over preteen/teen pop sensations without being labeled as pedophilic [a dubious ""advantage""...]

* Current educational curriculum balances more easily with average psychological profile (e.g. lower instances of ADHD, less need for gym on average to stay focused)

* Given legal preference in applications to schools and employers

* Can hang out with members of both genders without being labeled by sexual preference 

* Can express emotional insecurity more openly

* Female homosexuality is viewed more favorably within the society (subject to change)

* Being the underdog in the men vs. women historical drama [arguably an advantage for men too, along the way]

* In general, receives preference both from guys and girls in disputes [see study]

* Often not required to face rejection (in dating); rather, propositioned [both good and bad - see male privilege in this regard]",,False,,t5_2qtp5,1361925905.0,,,True,t3_19alvb,http://www.reddit.com/r/Equality/comments/19alvb/part_of_gender_equality_is_understanding_both/,

""So I told the guy; I've got nothing against black people, but you're acting like a Nigger right now.""

Lately, I've noticed that a trend of people who feel the use of the word ""nigger"" is completely OK as long as the user states that he/she is not a racist before they blurt it out. Here are the comments of a post which is rife with great examples of this attitude. There are even comments which imply or outright say that they are ""monkeys"" who belong in the jungle. If you haven't seen the video, there is a group of teens who are basically ""no good thugs"" and have decided to harass and steal from another teen girl on the bus.

Just as the ""epic"" beard guy's attacker was in the wrong, their behavior is terrible, and they are in need of punishment-- but they do not reflect the entire population of black Americans which you (those who made racist comments) are hurting every time you call them ""niggers"".This really has to stop. Call them thugs, scumbags, assholes, morons, criminals or douchebags; but please stop calling them niggers. When you use the term to label blacks behaving badly, you are zeroing in on race. Therefore, it is racist. There is no way around that.

And I say that most feminists DON'T hate men, to which they reply ""Most of the feminists I have ever met do.""

Sure, some feminists hate men.  Valerie Solanas created SCUM: The Society for cutting up men.  But keep in mind that that's just a small, generally uneducated and most of all, CRAZY faction.  Just like rebellious 15 year olds who think that all religious people are brainwashed automatons. 

Most feminists don't hate men.  Read some feminist blogs, and think about what they're saying carefully.  When they complain about the patriarchy, they're not complaining about men.  They're complaining about the system in which men almost always have an advantage over women.

Sure, you may have some disagreement. I'm just insisting that you shouldn't dismiss all feminism because of what some loonies think.  ",,False,,t5_2qtp5,True,,,True,t3_bwt8z,http://www.reddit.com/r/Equality/comments/bwt8z/saying_feminists_hate_men_is_like_saying_atheists/,

1254504045.0,26,self.Equality,9q95p,Members of /r/equality: It's time we have a better conversation when it comes to issues of sexual assault and rape. ,32,6,67,http://www.reddit.com/r/Equality/comments/9q95p/members_of_requality_its_time_we_have_a_better/,"Some people may be tired of the exhaustive and non-productive discussions that have come out of the many posts about sexual assault. I think it's near time that /r/equality has a huge discussion on the matter so we can all avoid the circumlocution. This is a self post to see if we can find some things we can agree on together and better understand each other.

Possible points we can all agree upon: 

* Rape and sexual assault are bad. Reducing the number of sexual assaults and false accusations is an important and tangible goal. 
* When it comes to sexual assault we must consider the victim (survivor) and the accused suspect. -We must not jump to conclusions. 
* False rape/assault claims are made. 
* Rape and assault go unreported.
* This is an issue that concerns heterosexual men, women, LGBTQ members and society as a whole. * Society plays a direct role in issues of sexual assault and rape. For example, men who feel the need to prove their masculinity or women who feel the need to not be called a ""slut"" can create compromising situations. This idea is also known as the issue with men being seen as ""pimps"" or ""players"" (often positive connotation) for having multiple women while women in a similar situation are seen as ""hoes"" or ""sluts"" (often negative connotation).
* When someone discusses issues with rape and sexual assault or false claims they are not necessarily saying that ""all men are bad"" or that ""all women are liars."" Do not let assumptions stymie the conversation.  

Some questions:

* In what ways (if any) is the judicial system flawed in the process of serving justice for both the victim and suspect? 
* What do we know about statistics with sexual assault? How are they flawed or bias? For example, some common statistics are that 1 in 4 women on college campus will be victims of assault and that 9 out 10 of the attacks made by men. (source needed) 
* What is a working definition of sexual assault/rape and how do you deal with the ""grey areas"" and consent (such as times when alcohol is present).

EDIT: I'm not sure where to go with all this information, if anyone has time it would be awesome to get some sort of summary or post where the question are answered. It would be a while for me to get around to doing something like that without neglecting my life and I hope find the time to thoroughly read through all the comments.

After a while he just got too drunk and his friends took him up to his bed to pass out. 

When he woke up she was lying in bed next to him and he had on different underwear and the sheets were all on the floor. The caller was obviously disturbed by the experience and didn't know what to make of it. He expressed fears of the girl being pregnant and wondered whether he would be responsible for that child if she was. The host, Dawson McCallister, said something along the lines of ""That just begs the question, Can a man be raped?"" Then he just told the caller that he didn't think the girl was pregnant because he doubted that his ""plumbing worked"" in that situation and thanked him for calling. 

He just thanked him for calling. He didn't tell the young man to call the police and report a rape or sexual assault. He just acted like it wasn't as big a deal as the same thing happening to a woman. This infuriated me.

The reactions were(paraphrasing due to bad memory) mainly saying, ""But we don't know the context of those stories!"", ""That's a bit stupid, to say that he can't take feminism seriously because of **those** stories"" and the exact words of one girl after the video was, ""I don't like him"" to which there was a bit of an agreement. I felt as if they weren't look at the content at all which really dissapointed me because i felt that an interesting conversation could have happened if they left there bias at the door.

Here was the kicker for me though. My teacher said this, ""I think that this man's a woman hater and if he were around the witch burning times, he would have burnt women"". What. The. Fuck.

TL;DR I showed my class the video, most, including the teacher, didn't like TJ which lead to them not looking at what he was saying but moreso how he was saying it. 

Do you think that these were all fair opinions or am i right to say that they didn't actually give it a fair go?

The answer is in the frenzy that occurred for reauthorization; politicians and media can accuse anyone that opposes the bill that they ""support violence against women"" as a shunning technique. Violence against women is an effective tool because it works with the belief that women are weaker, valuable, and in need of guarding.

",33,9,114,http://www.reddit.com/r/Equality/comments/hh706/examples_of_feminists_standing_up_for_mens_rights/,"Someone made a post wanting to prove the mensrights community wrong, asking for examples of feminists either fighting for men's rights, or supporting the end of female privilege.

*I am not linking or naming the post to avoid x-post drama*

Of the few responses at the time, none could name any. However, there was this gem:

&gt;  In my mind the damage men suffer at the reduction of their rights in certain circumstances and conditions is akin to the damage done to majority races when measures are taken to improve conditions of minority races. These things are a necessary evil. Women are judged generally better caregivers and receive custody of children more often. They are judged more often the victims of violence and law is formed around that basis. These things are terrible for some but better for most.

The closest example I have come across in my extensive reading in the field is in 1980, NOW passed a resolution opposing mandatory selective service for men. However, that is really meaningless since it was a symbolic gesture and they knew damn well it would not change a thing. In cases where there is a real threat to female privilege, they have always fought against it.

So, does anyone here have examples of feminists either:

*successfully* fighting for men's rights (not human rights, i.e. parental leave is not men's rights issue, it would only be a men's rights issue if feminists successfully fought for male parental leave but not women's).

or

Supporting an attempt to remove female privilege (the attempt need not come from feminists themselves, but they just need to support it)

My manager has apparently been on this since I started working here!

Naturally, I'm pissed - I'm being reduced to a bloody novelty and my work is not being judged on its merit. Even worse, there's at least one applicant out there who scored better on the interviews and wasn't hired just for being the wrong gender, while I evidently got the job for my ability to ""look cute at the corporate get-togethers"".

I'm seriously contemplating handing in my resignation and going back to web development or something. On the other hand, I'm pretty sure I won't score another job where I get to do what I do and earn the money I earn, and being unemployed during the recession is certainly a situation I'd prefer to avoid.

TL;DR: I just found out I was hired for my looks and the novelty of being a female coder, and I'm thinking about leaving my job.

Does this sort of thing happen often? How the hell do I confront my employer, who apparently just sees a talking pair of boobs, and explain to him exactly how sexist and archaic they're being? What the hell?

EDIT: This might come up a lot, so just to make clear that I'm not misinterpreting what I heard: The first thing that caught my attention was when I heard my manager say that I was pretty. To that the director replied ""that's why she was hired."" They then discussed the corporate policy and that it was complete BS, because the other candidates were more qualified. At least, they then repeated, I look good.

EDIT2: To be clear: I absolutely think I deserve my job, and that I'm good at what I do. What pisses me off is that people are not looking at the quality of my work, but at other criteria to decide whether I get hired or not. Obviously, this might also mean that they're not looking at the quality of my work now, and that I'll be stuck in my junior position indefinitely.

My personal opinion is that precautionary advice isn't victim blaming.

The counter-argument seems to be mainly centered around claiming that giving such advice draws attention away from finding a solution to the real problem (rapists).  This, in effect, shifts the responsibility of not being raped to the victim, whereas rape is the rapist's fault.  There's also the issue that most rape is perpetrated by people known to the victim, and that it's obviously difficult to give concrete advice for such situations.

These are good arguments.

However, I have to wonder why everything is so mutually exclusive?  Is it not possible to focus on both giving advice for safety *as well as* preventing rapists from raping?  Perhaps there are many situations (such as the friend/acquaintance rape referenced above) where advice doesn't help much.  But I can't shake the feeling that, for some situations, there are certain things people can do to prevent themselves from becoming victims.  I don't think that advising this is victim blaming.

Part of why I feel strongly about this is that I don't think rape is a special crime in this regard.  For almost everything, there are ways to stay safer.  Sure, crime happens sometimes in spite of precautionary measures, but this doesn't mean precautionary measures haven't prevented some crime from occurring.

I'm posting in /r/Equality because I think I'll get a broader range of opinions from both sides.  I truly want to know if my sentiments are wrong or not, and if you think they are, I hope your argument is solid enough to sway me.",,False,,t5_2qtp5,False,,,True,t3_b9ujk,http://www.reddit.com/r/Equality/comments/b9ujk/when_is_it_victim_blaming_and_when_is_it_good/,

We recently surpassed 800 members, and I think the last time I mentioned this we were around 500, so I just want to say a couple of things about using the orange and blue arrows here. For the most part I think things are going very well. I see many productive discussions, and I don't know about the other mods but I at least haven't seen a post here that wasn't relevant and appropriate in at least a couple of weeks. 

However, I just want to remind everyone that Reddiquette (you can find a link to it at the bottom of your screen) as well as community norms within Equality discourage downvoting comments that you happen to disagree with. Obviously I can't in any way enforce this, but I'm asking nicely: Since Equality is a subreddit intended and created to bring together people who will disagree on many issues, please use the down arrow only on comments that add nothing to the discussion. If a comment adds to the discussion but you disagree with it, just leave it alone, or reply to it.

I've heard feedback from members who've recently joined but were discouraged when they took time to make a coherent argument and received multiple downvotes. This is not a place where I want anyone to feel like making an effort to share one's views will be punished. Sure, downvotes mean nothing in the real world, but I think most of us get at least a little annoyed when we see a negative score next to one of our comments anyway.  So, please, even if you think someone's opinion is incorrect, leave the blue arrow alone. 

Also, one other periodic reminder: The spam tab is still broken, so there's still no way for any moderator to tell if one of your posts is stuck in the filter unless you notice it's missing and mention it. You can tell if your post has been filtered by logging out and checking the ""new"" page. If the post disappears when you log out, it's been filtered-- please send a private message to the moderator of your choice with a direct link to the filtered post, and they'll fix it.

That's all for now, thanks for listening! Tl;dr version follows for those who skipped over most of my wall of text:

* Please don't downvote comments because you disagree.
* Please do downvote comments if they are spam, nonsensical, or otherwise add nothing to the discussion.
* If one of your posts disappears, it's probably caught in the spam filter, which the moderators cannot access or modify in any way. PM a mod with the link to get it fixed.",,False,,t5_2qtp5,False,,,True,t3_8yrii,http://www.reddit.com/r/Equality/comments/8yrii/a_reminder_regarding_voting_in_equality_please/,

A good friend has written her feelings about this historic event:,27,6,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/Equality/comments/1d011j/france_legalized_gay_marriage_230413_a_good/,"Victory, but a victory born through hate and tears, lest we forget…

Homophobia… But what’s there to fear? Fear, after all, belongs to us…

The fear when I tear my hand away from the person I love to avoid conflict in the street, the frustration I feel when I can’t kiss them whenever or wherever I might be; The insults I must endure with no chance to defend my love or the love we share together; the hate that surges from the perverts, the intolerant with their burning gaze. How they’ve become so banal, such a part of our daily life.

But also the sadness, when I hear those people I love protesting their ‘right to express’ against what should be my right, tears are shed each time they slam this law or how unnatural homosexuality is: they are denying me who I am, my happiness, my chance to stand equal in their eyes. The hate I endure each day, insults, threats, mistrust and disdain; just as we believe we are accepted, we discover that we are only just tolerated…
Whatever did we do to earn such visceral attention?

Homophobia has had its coming out party.
The ‘ordinary’ homophobia, simple, free, protesting the ‘justice’ of maintaining their discrimination, against equality. “I’m not homophobic BUT…”

Do we ever speak of blackophobia or femmeophobia instead of racism or sexism? Homophobia never utters its name, never takes real shape or form, that shameful homophobia that we never expected, one never even imagined.

That’s why tonight is all the more important. Tonight bears the warmth of a new idea whose time has come, with equality as its color and tolerance its creed.

(A post on gender equality),28,10,95,http://www.reddit.com/r/Equality/comments/vvf5m/is_it_just_me_a_post_on_gender_equality/,"Does anyone else have this problem? I feel extremely disillusioned by the amount of conflict between feminism and the MRM. Every time I try to set my mind on an interpretation, it just seems to screw up all over the place. Although, I have to admit I do happen to empathize a little more with the MRM, simply because I think men's rights advocacy kind of is in a taboo state.

I don't feel this way about race, orientation, or anything else. I usually understand that as someone who is white, straight, and cisgendered, I tend to have a lot of advantages and I can easily see how each is marginalized by society. I can easily see how it's worse to be black or Latino in a white-dominated society, it's worse to be gay in a straight-dominated society, and it's worse to be trans in a cis-dominated society.

I don't see black and white power relations with gender, and it worries me. I feel like I could actually be denying a vast amount of male privilege, and I certainly don't want to be that type of person.

I don't feel like feminism is telling the entire side of the story. For example, I feel that the benevolent sexism argument against notions of female privilege is largely one constructed to remove female agency from situations which benefit them above men. And I think that  certain aspects of feminist theory may be perpetuating the very things they're fighting against, such as using the stereotype that women are weak in order to gain more advocacy for domestic violence.

I read one of my textbooks in the university I go to and it started talking about privilege, and it said that sometimes the oppressors (males) had certain disadvantages from their own roles. The book cited the one disadvantage as men weren't allowed to express a full range of emotions. I felt like this ridiculously undermined how men were disadvantaged in society, and it seems to me that men are the only group considered privileged with any true disadvantages to their roles.

I do admit, I've been watching a bunch of girlwriteswhat videos and have been on r/MR. And I try to be fair and look for good refutations of her arguments. But all I see are smear campaigns against her and the MRM. I don't see any truly well thought out refutations of what she says.

But I also see how certain MRA's can be completely dismissive of female problems within society. With the outright denial that some have that a wage gap based on any sort of discrimination exists and that feminism has reached its goal and solved all of women's problems already and that women are just happy-go-lucky compared to men.

I feel like I'm trying to sell my own points of view to too many people, all in an effort to bridge some sort of conflict that I see as never going away. Can anyone give me any advice?",,False,,t5_2qtp5,False,,,True,t3_vvf5m,http://www.reddit.com/r/Equality/comments/vvf5m/is_it_just_me_a_post_on_gender_equality/,

Is it not the intention of this subreddit to be unbiased and to allow readers to formulate their own opinions?

1247923757.0,20,self.Equality,92dbz,a statement on the purpose of and expectations for this sub-reddit,32,12,39,http://www.reddit.com/r/Equality/comments/92dbz/a_statement_on_the_purpose_of_and_expectations/,"Recent events have brought to light some apparent confusion with regard to the purpose of this sub-reddit and how it ought to function. Accordingly i thought it might be wise to lay down our expectations in a more official capacity — so, what follows is what should hopefully be a pretty clear list:

1\. **Gender Behaving Badly (GBB)** — GBB threads relating to either gender are not allowed under any circumstances unless that thread is used as context for a wider discussion or has some other extraordinary merit (in which case it will not be considered GBB).

Some examples of GBB threads are 'man rapes woman'; 'woman makes ridiculous alimony demand'; 'man writes offensive blog post'; 'woman does something bad but only gets &lt;insert lenient punishment&gt;'; &amp;c. These types of threads serve no purpose in the context of maintaining equality between genders, they only make everyone defensive and illustrate the obvious fact that all people are capable of wrong-doing.

An example of a thread that is not GBB: Saydrah's [jail-time](http://www.reddit.com/r/Equality/comments/8gt6c/jail_time_in_sweden_for_repeated_rape_of_several/) post — this is not GBB because the incident (a guy raping several girls) is only used to provide *context* to a broader discussion, that being a comparison of jail sentences between the US and Europe. The thread is not about the incident itself. Another example is '[Breastfeeding used to restrict Dad's access?](http://www.reddit.com/r/Equality/comments/8g6gd/breastfeeding_used_to_restrict_dads_access/)', which is not GBB because it has extraordinary merit (i.e. this is a subject that has not been discussed before and has wider implications than just one specific case).

2\. **Call-outs** — It is not appropriate to post links to other people's offensive comments (within this sub-reddit or any other) unless they meet the same qualifications of merit that potential GBB threads do. We don't need to know every time you find a misogynistic post on reddit (or any other site for that matter).

3\. **Moderation complaints, martyrdom, &amp;c.** — It is not appropriate to spam the sub-reddit with posts about how one of your threads was banned; or to post threads asking people to explain what's wrong with your comments; or to post threads complaining about how you're being picked on. Bring these problems up with [the mods](http://www.reddit.com/r/Equality/about/moderators/) in PM.

4\. **Revenge threads** — It is not appropriate to post threads for the sole purpose of 'getting back at' other posters or threads. If you want to link something that refutes a claim or implication made by someone's thread, try to do it *in that thread*. Otherwise the sub-reddit quickly devolves into 'YEAH WELL WOMEN DO IT TOO SEE THAT SUCKAS', 'NO U', 'NO U', &amp;c. Obviously there will be some exceptions to this (for example, a follow-up on a post from a month ago), but i think my intent is clear here.

5\. **Other posts** — Naturally, any obvious advertising/spamming or trolling will be banned.

6\. **Exceptions** — Sometimes a post that would otherwise have been banned manages to generate a lot of discussion before one of the moderators sees it. In this case we may leave it alone, as we have done in the past, because the existing discussion trumps the rules above.

7\. **Reports, bans, problems, &amp;c.** — Please know that reddit's spam tab is still broken, so the only way we can see reported comments/posts is to see them directly in action. Please know also that reddit does sometimes mistakenly auto-ban things (we have no control over this), and due to the same problem with the spam tab we can not see when this happens. If you feel that nobody is seeing your comments or posts, please PM us with a link to some of them so we can see if they've been banned. Finally on this subject, feel free to PM us with any problems you may have, but realise that we all have different lives, so it may take a little while for us to get back in some cases.

8\. **Subject matter** — This is a difficult one, because i think it goes against what a lot of the people have come to expect here, but it needs to be said: This sub-reddit was designed to address matters of equality *specifically*. Despite what many of the posts here may lead you to believe, this is not the divorce sub-reddit, the rape sub-reddit, the domestic-violence sub-reddit, or the interesting-behavioural-studies sub-reddit. Anything posted here should have a *direct* connection to equality.

Many of these policies are of course subjective and open to the interpretation of the mods. This is unfortunate but unavoidable, and we obviously will make every effort to be impartial.

Lastly, with regard to censorship concerns: All the mods agree that censorship is distasteful, and we don't take our power lightly. However, we feel that some moderation is warranted, due to the nature of this sub-reddit. Equality is not a large general-purpose sub-reddit like Politics or News — it has a very specific goal (promoting open, civil discussions about controversial issues between 'sides' that are often strongly opposed), and without some guidance the entire conversation can be held hostage by just a few people who know the right buttons to press.",,False,,t5_2qtp5,True,,,True,t3_92dbz,http://www.reddit.com/r/Equality/comments/92dbz/a_statement_on_the_purpose_of_and_expectations/,moderator

I'm just trying to ask a question and see what r/equality thinks as well.)

The main thing that infuriates me as an equal rights activist is the lack of true equal rights where one gender is given freedoms to do what they want while the other gets insulted for it and that the gender who gets insulted is seen as the bad person against equality.

One example that pertains to what I'm referring to is something that I've seen many times before where a woman hits a man multiple times for no good reason with intent of hurting him, and when the man hits her back even slightly to defend himself without trying to hurt her, he's seen as a horrible person and the woman is essentially cheered on for her actions. I'm not saying men should be able to hit women, I'm saying women shouldn't be able to hit men and men shouldn't be able to hit women. Nobody should be allowed to hit anyone because abuse in any form is wrong regardless of gender and in order for there to be true equal rights, both genders should be shunned for an action, not just one.

Another question is, how did it being acceptable for women to hit men become a social norm, and why is it that in this age of equal rights that women aren't seeing this as an injustice as well?

For me, I think that I would want to eliminate the perception that a woman's worth after a certain age is based on motherhood, and that a woman who does not have children or does not want children must be selfish or a child-hater. Along with that would go the idea that a woman can't work hard to provide financially for her family while still being a loving parent. A lot of people still truly believe that if a mother works outside the home, she's neglecting her children-- even if a stay-at-home father is present in the home! That's perfectly ridiculous. Women who wish to do so can certainly take on the role of provider and use the same tactics working fathers have used since the dawn of time to stay involved with their children.
