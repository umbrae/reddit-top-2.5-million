FACEBOOK INFO: for the JULY 4th Protest https://www.facebook.com/events/507614159287698/

**Time and Date:** July 4th, 2pm to 9pm. The greatest amount of people will be there from 5 - 9pm so if you can't make the whole thing come for some of those hours.

**Place:** Lake Eola Park near the Walt Disney Amphitheater

Bring **WATER**, your own signs, you can print off flyers / business cards if you would like, and make sure you have a way to get food. Parking will probably be somewhat difficult as streets around the park will be closed, plan accordingly.

Flyer: https://docs.google.com/file/d/0BzabW33pS9BleWpGUld6azFPRjQ/edit?usp=sharing


**As this slowly drifts down into the reddit void it may become more difficult for us to stay organized. Please if you are at all interested join the facebook event group, even with a fake facebook is fine. If you don't want to do that I will try and continue to update as long as it is on the frontpage of this subreddit.**


If you still have concerns or worries about this I need to know, don't hesitate to message me. 


I have lived here in Central Florida all my life and now that I am finishing my classes at Seminole State College I will be a UCF Knight in the Fall. I have always looked up to every single UCF student and I want to continue to do so. Many of you have probably read about the NSA and their current missteps intruding on our Fourth Amendment rights. As an American and Central Floridian I would hope that many of you are as outraged about this as I am. For too long I have sat back and watched as our rights have been forgotten in the struggle for ""Security."" There is a quickly growing subreddit /r/restorethefourth that is a meeting ground for many who feel the same as myself across the country. Yet I am more interested in you, my neighbors, my friends, and my classmates. Is this enough to get you out and stand together? If not, what will be? Anyone who wishes to discuss a peaceful protest made by and attended by UCF students may discuss it here or on the event page. Any ideas, thoughts, beliefs and worries are welcome. Go Knights.

If you think you can make it, join the event page.

**READ THIS:** IF you plan to attend you should read this post http://www.reddit.com/r/restorethefourth/comments/1g1cd4/why_it_should_be_july_4th_and_what_you_should/ and it should be known that you need to dress well, maybe even formally. Many occupy protests had problems because many could not relate to those protesting purely because of how they looked. We are going to be on a very strict message, NO other messages will be acknowledged other than those that involve PRIVACY or the FOURTH AMENDMENT. We must be ABSOLUTELY UNITED refrain from engaging in any other political or religious discussion if it will cause a division in the group. This is a non partisan issue, every American should be able to get on board.  Anyone who instigates or causes any violence will be immediately asked to leave, **if any sort of violence progresses I will have police called.** That is the way this protest must be to garner the respect that it needs. Anyone standing beside us must hold themselves to a high standard and must not be easy to instigate. The very thing we are protesting is the overreach of government power into our rights, I ask that you trust your fellow classmates but I also ask that you be careful. This is not just something fun to do because you are bored. I am here to make a difference and I demand that anyone who I stand beside is too.

**Thanks!** I mean this in the most sincere form, thank you all so much for the info you have given me. I can't wait to meet some of you and hopefully take a stand with you all.",,False,,t5_2qh7r,1372908497.0,,,True,t3_1g07x5,http://www.reddit.com/r/ucf/comments/1g07x5/peaceful_protest_in_defense_of_the_fourth/,

It checks myUCF on an interval up to every 60 seconds and texts you immediately when a seat becomes available in the class you're monitoring.

I've gotten some good feedback so far even though it's a weird time to launch with it being between semesters. I'd love to hear what you guys think, any ideas for additional features / any bugs discovered or areas that should be clarified.

Hello, Cross-Cultural students, I am writing to express my views on how some of you have conducted yourself in this university course you are taking with me. It is not uncommon for some-to-many American students, who typically, are first-generation college students, to not fully understand, and maybe not even appreciate the purpose of a university. Some students erroneously believe a university is just an extension of high school, where students are spoon-fed “soft” topics and dilemmas to confront, regurgitate the “right” answers on exams (right answers as deemed by the instructor or a textbook), and then move on to the next course.

Not only is this not the purpose of a university (although it may feel like it is in some of your other courses), it clearly is not the purpose of my upper-division course on Cross-Cultural Psychology. The purpose of a university, and my course in particular, is to struggle intellectually with some of life's most difficult topics that may not have one right answer, and try to come to some conclusion about what may be “the better answer” (It typically is not the case that all views are equally valid; some views are more defensible than others). Another purpose of a university, and my course in particular, is to engage in open discussion in order to critically examine beliefs, behaviors, and customs. Finally, another purpose of a university education is to help students who typically are not accustomed to thinking independently or applying a critical analysis to views or beliefs, to start learning how to do so. We are not in class to learn “facts” and simply regurgitate the facts in a mindless way to items on a test. Critical thinking is a skill that develops over time. Independent thinking does not occur overnight. Critical thinkers are open to having their cherished beliefs challenged, and must learn how to “defend” their views based on evidence or logic, rather than simply “pounding their chest” and merely proclaiming that their views are “valid.” One characteristic of the critical, independent thinker is being able to recognize fantasy versus reality; to recognize the difference between personal beliefs which are nothing more than personal beliefs, versus views that are grounded in evidence, or which have no evidence.

Last class meeting and for 15 minutes today, we addressed “religious bigotry.” Several points are worth contemplating:

Religion and culture go “hand in hand.” For some cultures, they are so intertwined that it is difficult to know with certainty if a specific belief or custom is “cultural” or “religious” in origin. The student in class tonight who proclaimed that my class was supposed to be about different cultures (and not religion) lacks an understanding about what constitutes “culture.” (of course, I think her real agenda was to stop my comments about religion).

Students in my class who openly proclaimed that Christianity is the most valid religion, as some of you did last class, portrayed precisely what religious bigotry is. Bigots—racial bigot or religious bigots—never question their prejudices and bigotry. They are convinced their beliefs are correct. For the Christians in my class who argued the validity of Christianity last week, I suppose I should thank you for demonstrating to the rest of the class what religious arrogance and bigotry looks like. It seems to have not even occurred to you (I'm directing this comment to those students who manifested such bigotry), as I tried to point out in class tonight, how such bigotry is perceived and experienced by the Muslims, the Hindus, the Buddhists, the non-believers, and so on, in class, to have to sit and endure the tyranny of the masses (the dominant group, that is, which in this case, are Christians).

The male student who stood up in class and directed the rest of the class to “not participate” by not responding to my challenge, represented the worst of education. For starters, the idea that a person—student or instructor—would instruct other students on how to behave, is pretty arrogant and grossly disrespects the rights of other students who can and want to think for themselves and decide for themselves whether they want to engage in the exchange of ideas or not. Moreover, this “let's just put our fingers in our ears so we will not hear what we disagree with” is appallingly childish and exemplifies “anti-intellectualism.” The purpose of a university is to engage in dialogue, debate, and exchange ideas in order to try and come to some meaningful conclusion about an issue at hand. Not to shut ourselves off from ideas we find threatening.

Universities hold a special place in society where scholarly-minded folks can come together and discuss controversial, polemic, and often uncomfortable topics. Universities, including UCF, have special policies in place to protect our (both professors’ and students’) freedom to express ourselves. Neither students nor professors have a right to censor speech that makes us uncomfortable. We're adults. We're at a university. There is no topic that is “off-limits” for us to address in class, if even only remotely related to the course topic. I hope you will digest this message, and just as important, will take it to heart as it may apply to you.

[The college subreddit competition](http://blog.reddit.com/2011/08/grow-college-subreddit-competition.html) has begun! Basically, it's a contest to increase the number of page views and subscriptions of a college subreddit by absolute numbers or relative to the undergrad population. UCF is one of the biggest schools in the country and currently has 47,652 undergrads but only 607 subscribers so I really think we have a shot at winning either one. 

So, what can you do to help? Tell your friends to subscribe, post /r/ucf on your facebook, but most importantly, advertise on campus! For anyone that advertises /r/ucf on campus you will get your choice of any ucf themed flair (a little message next to your username) and first dibs on a UCF reddit sticker if we win. The best on campus advertisement will get the poster if we win the best percentage growth award! All you have to do is advertise on campus, take a picture of it, and submit it to this subreddit with a comment with what you want as your flair. Examples/ideas of on campus advertisements include:

* Writing reddit.com/r/ucf on the corner of a class room white board
* Telling people to visit ucf.reddit.com w/ sidewalk chalk
* Hanging a reddit sign in your lab
* Advertising reddit on outside your dorm room's door. 

You can also get user flair by submitting great stories or original content. If I see a good post you submitted, I'll ask you what you want your user flair to be. 

Also, a reminder that there is [/r/ucf meetup tomorrow](http://www.reddit.com/r/ucf/comments/jndrg/ucf_redditor_meetup_time_place/)! I'll be there and I hope you come out too. 

My goal with this is to make it as fun as possible. If you have any suggestions, leave them here or tell me at the meetup tomorrow.

If you're interested in running around, pretending the Apocalypse is happening, please, please, please, come out and help us! Please invite everybody you know, and if you would, please let me know in the comments if you're interested.

You will, of course, get credited in the film, and it should be an all around fun time. And what, free food, too??? What??

P.S. Wear something you don't care about (without big brand names showing)!

So as you may know, Universal Knights was overshadowed by a torrential downpour this year. My friends and I after being soaked by either rain or rides today, tried to dry ourselves off but evidently, bathroom stalls at Islands of Adventure seem to only have electric hand dryers.

After realizing this, a thought came to me that the handicapped stall in the bathroom could possibly have actual paper towels. Turns out, it did, and when I went in to dry off, I happened to notice a ring on the floor. This sounds a bit like some kind of popular book and/or movie series doesn't it?

The ring itself was found in the men's bathroom just outside the entrance to the Hulk around 11pm. I don't really want to put up a picture of it or describe it because I feel like anyone can just say it's theirs, so instead I'll do this:

If you lost a high school class ring, PM me with a description of what your ring looks like, and if it matches the ring I found, I'll meet up with you on campus to return it, or even mail it to you if you're not from here.

The ring is pretty large, it says Vanguard High School on it, and it's got a name in fairly large letters on it as well.

I never got one myself, but I know these things are kind of expensive and for some people they have sentimental value as well, so if this is your ring, let me know!

EDIT: redundancy and grammar

EDIT 2: So I gave Universal Studios lost and found a call, and turns out they do this thing where they send you a shipping label to ship found items to them! So hey guy, your ring will be at the Universal Studios lost and found after I get the label from them and ship it off. If they do this then I'm sure they have a way of shipping lost items to their owners as well, so if you're from out of town I wouldn't sweat it.",,False,,t5_2qh7r,1366669319.0,,,True,t3_1cupet,http://www.reddit.com/r/ucf/comments/1cupet/if_you_went_to_universal_knights_and_lost_a_high/,

1357230844.0,43,self.ucf,15w734,Just a friendly reminder to those of you who will be using the gym in the upcoming weeks,57,14,42,http://www.reddit.com/r/ucf/comments/15w734/just_a_friendly_reminder_to_those_of_you_who_will/,"I know that a lot of people have New Years resolutions to get in better shape and eat healthier. Luckily, the UCF gym is one of the best university gyms in the southeast and has more than enough resources to help those of you who are new to the gym get started. As a regular of our gym, I just wanted to post a couple helpful tips...some of them are common, but some of them will only apply to our gym.


1. Be prepared before you walk in the door. Have your UCF ID (just in case the finger scanners are down) and a water bottle in hand. The gym also plays pretty terrible music so I would recommend an mp3 player and earbuds.

2. Dress in ""appropriate"" attire. You will get kicked out if you are wearing cargo shorts or flip flops. The typical gym outfit consists of a tshirt or tank top, gym shorts, and athletic shoes. You don't *have* to wear that, but you will get a lot of weird looks if you decide to wear jeans, pants, a polo, etc.

3. Know what exercises you will be doing. Whatever you do, don't just walk around the gym and pick a machine because it looks good. Check out /r/fitness for some recommendations on beginner programs.

4. The gym gets PACKED between 4pm and 9pm. Avoid it at all costs during these times.

5. Once you're in, just a few recommendations for etiquette: re-rack your weights in the correct spot. Wipe down the equipment you're using. Don't curl in the squat rack. If you're confused, ask one of the employees and they'll help you out.

6. Finally, no one gives a shit about how much weight you are pushing. Everyone has different goals and different starting points. As long as you have great form, no one cares if you can only bench 65lbs, that's fine. Just do it with proper form. Any stares you might get while you're working out are probably us regulars thinking ""I hope he sticks with it"" or ""keep it up dude.""

I moonlight a few nights a week at reddit's least favorite joint, Papa Johns. I don't care about the owner or his political snafu but we have a secret coupon for 50%. It has to be used for online orders only.  
  
FM269 is the coupon code.  
  
There's some sort of contest where win a prize or something, I don't really know. The coupon code is tied to our store and can be used to order from any store online. I guess it's a test to see how well we can advertise ourselves as employees.  

Maybe the prize will be free health care to all employees...  
Anyway, it's the best deal going on right now and could hopefully put a little more cash in my fellow drivers' pockets as well.  
  
[I've already tested it to see if it works.](http://i.imgur.com/eiGNCYn.png)  
  
-this is not the store I work at.  
-the coupon doesn't stack with other deals. but still gives the best financial value.  
-use at many times as you want. 27th is the last day.  
note: it doesn't take 50% off the delivery charge unfortunately.  
edit: spacing  
  
*Edit4*: I apologize if its not working for some people. This is all the info I got. You can try calling the online support line for additional help.  
If that doesn't work you can try calling up the store in your area and ask for their unique only code. The guys at my store offer over the phone almost every call.  
**edit5**: for those you said they couldn't get it, the next time I go into my night shift I'll look up a coupon code in the system and PM you guys. it'll probably be something like 1 1-topping pizza for $7.99. it'll be a call in coupon only and you'll have to read them the coupon number over the phone.  
  
**edit6**: it appears it may only work for corporate owned stores. sorry, i'm not sure which ones those are. you can try ordering on the phone and using this coupon code LG1799. it's a large 1 topping for 7.99. but I have no control of franchise stores since they're individually owned...",,False,,t5_2qh7r,1368840683.0,,,True,t3_1egi9n,http://www.reddit.com/r/ucf/comments/1egi9n/i_moonlight_delivering_pizza_in_orlando_a_few/,

So you're bored, and you don't know what to do... well here's some advice from a grumpy old graduate.

There is **no reason** you should be bored at UCF. It's like being sprayed with a firehose, and you're sitting here saying you're thirsty.

If you live on campus here is rule #1:
&gt;The only reason you should be in your dorm room is to sleep or have sex.

**Everything else should be done out of your dorm and preferably with other people.**

Still want to play video games? You damn well better have 2+ other people in the room that you can talk shit to when you kill them on whatever video game you're playing.

Still don't know what to do? [Here](http://rso.asf.ucf.edu/Public/Pages/PublicEnd/GeneralPublicForm.aspx) is a list of about 500 organizations that want you as a member. Go talk to them, they're all setup outside the Union during lunch.

I want to make this absurdly fucking clear: **this is the only time in your life where people are paid a salary to make sure you aren't bored.** After college it will be infinitely harder to meet people that don't suck.

So don't sit here doing the old scroll-scroll-scroll on reddit. Get it blocked on your computer if you can. Take it a step further-- if there is any way to make sure you can't access the internet in your room during the day, then do it.

So no, I'm not going to give you the top ten tips and tactics to make you not being bored. All it takes is you to turn off your computer and go outside.

That's it.

Stop scrolling.

   I decided to do this AMA after reading some of the discussion in [this post]( http://www.reddit.com/r/ucf/comments/rjmqg/how_i_feel_walking_on_campus_with_all_the_bikes/) about bike riders and longboarders running into people on campus. I also remember posts a while back talking about the bike auction. I thought people might be interested in knowing all about the bike situation on campus, riding in Orlando, and about Spokescouncil.

*A little about myself:*

   I have been biking in Orlando for 4 years and have been working with Spokescouncil for the last 3 to grow the bike community in the East Orlando area and work with UCF and local government to make cycling in our area safer. Since moving here, I have gone from being a sidewalk-cyclist to riding in the road with traffic, which it turns out is much safer and easier once you know how. I ride to commute, for transportation, for fun, and have done a little bit of touring. I work on my own bikes and help friends with theirs but tend to let the more qualified mechanics in Spokescouncil do the tricky stuff at shop hours. 

   I am very knowledgeable about bike laws in Florida and safe riding techniques. I will soon be trained as a Cycling Savvy instructor, which will allow me to teach a course on safe riding practices. I also recently became a voting member of the Bicycle and Pedestrian Advisory Committee (BPAC) for Metroplan Orlando. The committee decides on sidewalk, roadway, and trail improvements for cyclists and pedestrians in Orange, Seminole, and Osceola counties. I also have frequent discussions with campus administrators about bike racks, bike abandonment, and safety.

*About Spokescouncil:*

   The main goal of Spokescouncil is to get more people riding bicycles. There’s so many reasons to ride a bike and we don’t care why you ride or what you ride as long as you do. Our efforts to get more people riding include holding fun bike rides, teaching bike repair for free to anyone who wants to learn, and working with UCF administration and local government to help make our area better for cyclists. 

So that’s it! Anything you want to know about the club, biking on campus or in Orlando, commuting or anything else, ask away.

Bikes Bikes Bikes!

I fixed up the quad from a couple weekends ago and didn't test it at home... so of course it was vibrating and crap when I got to campus. Ended up side swiping a tree. No damage except a couple broken props. Except I'm out of props and Graves is closed on Sunday. FUCK. So I drive home and find some old ones to put on so I can at least take care of the vibes. Reluctantly put hot glue everywhere(I prefer epoxy because it doesn't melt in the sun...) to try and dampen the vibes. Everything was working great, it was hovering silky smooth over my driveway and then BRRR it fell from about eye level onto the concrete. A wire came off the back left ESC... I soldered that back on and miraculously it still flies fine and the vibes are gone.

Headed back to campus and flew milican hall twice. Then I realized the SD card must have popped out of the camera when it hit the driveway. So it recorded about 10 seconds to the internal 64MB flash until it got full. FUCK. No vibration-free milican footage :(. Next we walked to HEC and flew a battery there. Then Memory Mall.

The noise floor here is ridiculous. Something is spewing at or around 1280MHz. My video had interference at only 200-300 meters so I really had to maintain line of sight to keep signal. I wanted to fly from the fountain all the way down to the libra dorms around MAP and stuff but the video just wasn't solid enough for me to feel safe buzzing over people on the sidewalks. I had to stay really close to the ground station.

Also, it was my first time flying here so it took a few minutes to learn the landscape plus the ""RF landscape(where to expect gray areas etc.)"". Maybe I'll have a decent video out in a month or two that can show teh whole campus.

**tl'dr**: fountain footage has jello/vibrations but then I fixed the problem for the next locations. Too much RF noise around here to do any ""serious"" flying like in my other vids. Maybe I'll try in a couple weeks with the ground station on top of garage I and D. Enjoy the shitty royalty-free dubstep I found :P

I don't see the benefit of spending $66,400 (or $140,000 for non-Florida residents) per National Merit Scholar. It seems excessive, especially when UCF has been forced to raise tuition by 15% this year.

Look at it this way:

[In 2011, we added 74 Nat'l Merit Scholars to UCF's student body.](http://www.centralfloridafuture.com/ucf-in-top-5-as-up-and-coming-school-1.2634085)

74 students X $66,400 over four years (I'll be generous to UCF and assume they're all in-state) = $4,913,600.

We will end up spending **FIVE MILLION DOLLARS** on recruiting last year's group of scholars.

In contrast, [UF is spending $1000 a year on its National Merit Scholars](http://www.alligator.org/opinion/columns/article_683327b2-64a3-11e0-8ba8-001cc4c002e0.html)--that's $4000 compared to $66,400.

I won't deny that it's important to attract intelligent, competitive students to UCF. However, I believe that essentially bribing them to attend is the worst way to do it. We should be using those five million dollars we are spending every year by handing out these scholarship packages to improve our school and make it appealing to the students we're trying to attract.

I would understand if the scholarship package was a full-ride to UCF. But $8000 a semester goes far beyond simply paying for tuition, especially if you consider that these bright kids in the National Merit Scholar program probably have other scholarships, too.

I don't know what we can do about it, but I just thought I would bring it to everyone's attention.",,False,,t5_2qh7r,False,,,True,t3_zatm4,http://www.reddit.com/r/ucf/comments/zatm4/ucf_is_giving_national_merit_scholars_8300_a/,

I'm not sure who organized it (Knight-Thon? Anyone know?), but they have a table set up inside asking for donations for the Children's Miracle Network. And they went about it the entirely wrong way.  
  They have Rebecca Black's ""Friday"" playing *extremely* loudly on all the speakers in the gym, and for every five dollars raised, the song will be turned off for one minute. This is wrong and a freaking terrible method for so many reasons: 1) They gave me an apalling impression of the group by basically trying to annoy me into giving $5. That could easily prevent me from donating, except 2) I don't bring my wallet with me to the gym, and I know I'm not alone in that. 3) a lot of people have iPods. Don't like it? Turn your music up louder. Or just leave. That's also easy. And 4) anyone who is going to donate probably already was going to, unless #1 kicked in and it swayed them not to. So, it basically just pissed off the RWC staff (who work 4+ shifts, I believe) and the Subway staff (who work 6-8 hour shifts). I talked to a few employees and they all had migraines. Myself, I was at the pool for swim lessons today and a lifeguard had to ask twice for the song to be turned down because nobody could hear their instruction. Apparently the group didn't want to.  
  I think it's great people were willing to take time out of their day to help raise money for charity, but *come on*. How did anyone think that was a good idea?

Next, Thursday night we're going to have a gaming night in the Tech Commons.  We'll have a couple Xboxes set up in the BYOT lab on both 60"" TVs and a few smaller stations in the area.  I've got both Dell and Microsoft coming in to hand out prizes and swag.  Our local Gamestop will be providing a few of the Xboxes and the games.


So far, I've only asked Gamestop to bring Halo.  If you have any specific suggestions, we can probably get it for the night.  If I see a common consensus on a certain game, I'll try to grab that.


Should I ask for a Wii or anything for Mario Kart or Smash Bros?


**EDIT**  The following games will be set up:

* FIFA '12

* NBA 2k12

* Persona

* MVC3

* Halo/ or semi-similar shooter

That is right... MAD MEN THEMED! So 50-60s music! Classy dressing! No need for a suit so a dress shirt will be fine. You can still come even if you don't want to dress up!


This will also be a potluck! So if you want to bring something to eat/drink, bring it! Also, please list the item that you are bringing so that there won't be too many duplicates.


FACEBOOK EVENT: Please 'accept' if you are coming so I that i can have an estimate of how many people will be at my place. https://www.facebook.com/events/368434596550372/


Here are the list of foods so far: (Copied and pasted. I took out peoples names).

- shitty egg rolls, or shitty pancit. I have Ice pops. (I might make a shrimp etouffee instead)

- Adobo, egg rolls, and banana egg rolls

- Candied Bacon, and Baked Brie! THAT is RIGHT! BAKED BRIE

- A nice molded Gelatin (60s style) 

- Pumpkin Pie 

- BEER (NEED MORE OF THIS)

- Nachos

- Tamale Casserole (I don't know what that is)


PARKING: I live in a subdivision, so please park properly. Things might get towed if you park on the grass or like a douchebag. Also, please park on the correct side of the road. Cops love to come to this area and ticket people for some reason.


Karaoke: If anyone has a Karaoke! Bring it! Also any loud speaker would help (instead of shitty laptops). Here is the playlist for the event! http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLD7850C86C0B25A7D&amp;feature=mh_lolz


ALSO GAMES: I am not sure how lame this is... since I am pretty lame. But I was thinking of having a guessing game. You can choose to have either a scientist or a hollywood celebrity/famous person/non-scientist. I will then put the sticky note on your head/forehead. So you ask questions about who you are.

There is a new independent coffee shop open in the Waterford Lakes shopping center. I just checked the UCF thread, surprised no one has mentioned them yet. The coffee is very good with fair prices asked for the quality offered (discount with student ID as well). Yes, it's not a place you could afford to likely visit on a daily basis but it's a nice welcome change from hustle/bustle of campus or typical Starbucks. Overall, the place is very well done. It is apparent the owner took the endeavor seriously and invested a good sum of money into the business. Cost of espresso equipment alone is probably over 10-15 K. Interior is clean, modern, and very calming. Staff are well trained, informative, and very friendly as well. I don't work there or own it, I'm just a grad student who wants to see this local business succeed and thrive in the area. The UCF community needs more places like this as we grow in exposure and attempt to develop our state/national identity. 

So, go and check them out!",,False,,t5_2qh7r,False,,,True,t3_1h966g,http://www.reddit.com/r/ucf/comments/1h966g/vespr_craft_coffee_open_in_waterford/,

:EDIT:

Just a general reply to those that asked for it:

I was on Gemini going towards the towers and waiting to make a left turn into C. Here's a google streetview image of the exact location 

http://thumbsnap.com/pb3VPccP 

Anyway, the traffic light was green for the right lane and clear for the left (as in the picture), so I decided to turn left (oncoming traffic in the opposite direction was not present). The girl was coming out of the garage and trying to turn left onto gemini (towards the towers), and turned just as I did, so we both screeched to a stop in the middle of the intersection about 5 feet from one another. I backed up into my lane (no other car behind me), but she stayed in the middle of the intersection for about 10 seconds, covering her face and tearing up. I think the light turned for oncoming traffic and she decided to leave the intersection. Not much I could have done, and I'm not sure if I made a legal left turn.

For those interested in researching it, it was a T-intersection  (but each arm is a 4 lane highway) and I was making a left turn from the stubby part of the T into the long arm, and the applicable traffic light was a 5-bulb style (two lanes sharing red) with only the green light lit for the right lane going straight.

As well as about 30 hamburger patties (over-purchase for a cookout).


However, the hot-dogs are in restaurant packs, which means they're not hermetically sealed, and they've been kept on ice for the past 36 hours, so I'm not comfortable throwing them in the freezer and using them long-term for the next 2 or 3 years or however long that'd take me to eat.


So I figured I'd throw a sausage fest at my place!


What I do have:


* Hotdogs

* Hamburgers

* Chips

* Brownie Tray

* Gas for the grill



What I might not have enough of:

* Hamburger buns (I have 8)

* Cheese (I have say 15 slices)

* Ketchup (I have one bottle)

* Mustard (I have half a bottle)

* Hotdog buns (I've got almost 40, though)

* Soda / Beer (I have a 20 or 30 cans of Miller Lite, but I'm low on the good stuff / only have like 10 cans of regular Pepsi in the fridge)

* Disposable plates (I've got my regular plates and that's it)

* Ice



What I want out of you:

* Have a good time

* Help me not waste these hot dogs

* Help on the grill if you know what you're doing

* Don't be a douche and crap up my place or cause drama

* Bring stuff on the ""might not have"" list if you think you'll want some, especially if a lot of people reply




My apartment is on the smaller side (my living room gets rather crowded after 8 or 9 people), but there's a BIG field next to / in front of my place (which is also where you'll be parking), so you might want to bring a folding chair if you have one, and keep it in your car, just in case.



**Time**: The time is subject to adjustment by an hour or two, but I'm thinking 4PM to 10PM TOMORROW (I get up early for work and don't stay up late lol). Please RSVP by replying or by PM so I have an idea on attendance. 



**Location**: 3770 Khayyam Ave (Behind the Sterling apartments on Alafaya)



**Directions**: If you're heading North on Alafaya, take a left on Mendel. If you're heading South on alafaya, take a right on Solon (The roads are a U-shape and both connect to Khayyam). 



**Parking**: I'm on the West side of Khayyam (side away from UCF), about 2/3 down the road to the North. You'll see a wood fence, with a driveway to a field. This is where you'll want to park (overflow parking is on the side of the street if that becomes necessary). Please DO NOT park in the paved lot unless you have to (motorcycle, etc). My neighbors won't be happy if they can't find parking. 





Also: If there are left-over hotdogs and you want to bring some home / you want to swing by and grab a few for your own purposes, please feel free!


**UPDATE** (6:45AM): Seems I have 3 or 4 of my buddies showing up from my Facebook post, so this looks like it'l be a good size event. I'm set on cheese for hamburgers, unless you want to bring something fancy for yourself. Ketchup will probably be OK, but one more bottle would probably be good. I had a few buddies over last night though, and of course we had hotdogs... did not even make a dent in the box **but I'm now down to 25 or so hotdog buns, and completely out of Pepsi**. Now, back to getting ready, see everyone later today!


**UPDATE 2**(3:00PM): So, my place is as clean as it's gonna get. Nobody else has responded on Facebook, so, it's still 3 or 4 plus whoever from here. I've got two people bringing hamburger buns and hotdog buns, but we still might be a little short on hotdog buns (right now we have enough buns for 2-3 hotdogs per person, whereas I have like 5-8 hotdogs per person). Publix isn't too far away so I'm not stressing it. A few people have asked about running the event past 10PM... and while I'm not going to say ""no"" at this point, it's not too likely. We'll have to see how the event goes, but, I normally go to bed like 11:30PM (screw early work schedules), and would like some time to clean up etc. ",,False,,t5_2qh7r,1340478672.0,,,True,t3_vgd0a,http://www.reddit.com/r/ucf/comments/vgd0a/who_wants_to_come_to_my_sausage_fest_i_was_given/,

================================================

Yes that's right, you can have the entire master bedroom! You will even get your own bathroom. Guy or girl. (we are guys)

***INFO***

Nice 3/2 house between Rouse and Dean, south of Colonial. 10 minute drive to campus (UCF or VCC). Big driveway and in a private cul-de-sac with only two other houses. Quite neighborhood with cool people. This is nothing like student living. Fully furnished, you are only responsible for your bedroom. Screened in patio, carpeted bedrooms, high ceilings, open living room, chill dining area, and fully stocked kitchen.

***ROOMIES***

Myself and my other roommate are computer nerds, but the fun type. We are also gear heads and have a fix-it-yourself attitude on most things that are mechanical or technical. We don't throw parties and keep it pretty quiet around the house, but still like to have a good time. We keep the house clean and functional. Ent friendly, but not indoors (hence patio). No furry friends due to allergies.

***COSTS***

The best part of the whole experience is that you can have this awesome room for only $400! Yes, that's right! And utilities average between $100-$125 per month if you have common sense and turn off things when you are not in the room. Utilities include everything, power, water, and Brighthouse with 20Mb Internet on wifi and 1800 channels with HD in all rooms.

I spoke with the manager at a sports bar I play trivia at regularly in Altamonte Springs (just north of Orlando) about having a barcraft. They've got a couple dozen HDTVs and 4 projectors with 6 foot screens. 

He was very interested in the idea and would love to try it. When I asked about putting it on a couple of tvs, the manager suggested putting it on at least one of the projectors. He's also willing to pipe in audio as well. I'm going to do a test sometime in January, probably on a slow week night, to make sure the connection can handle a stream. Then the first official one would be for IPL4 (which IGN's site claims will be ""late February"").

So, I'm trying to gauge interest so I can let him know how many people to expect. Who'd want to come?

[this](http://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/kvo85/bank_of_america_to_charge_5_debit_card_fee_switch/) was on the reddit front page today, as I read through the article I saw it stated that SunTrust had already implemented a $5 monthly debit fee.

This made me do a double take and I checked my bank statement and saw no $5 monthly charge. I continued to read elsewhere and found that SunTrust implemented this last summer for regular checking accounts. Most of us have ""student checking"" which is free of the charge as of right now BUT suntrust plans on rolling it out on ALL checking accounts by the next year (that'll be the upcoming summer).

**TL;DR:** SunTrust is planning on charging $5 a month to use a debit card, for college students who often have under $50 in their accounts at any time (or less) this kinda sucks, time to check out credit unions!

IvyLoL is a collegiate LoL league so ONLY North American college students will be playing. It will involve playing one game a week and even involves divisions and rankings.

I've decided to put together a team for UCF and compete. So if you're a student or alumni (with a @ucf email) then I'd love to get you on our team! It would involve a little practice together every week, but you'll get to make friends and improve your skills regardless.

Level 30s would be involved in the ranked play, but anyone can join our roster to meet other UCF students and play some LoL together.

Matches occur 3 PM on Saturday.

If you're interested, simply leave a comment and friend 'Wunderthorpe' in game.

Edit: Team created! Signups begin soon! We can only field five people per game, and each match-up involves one game of summoner's rift and one game of dominion. The name and roster is subject to vote/change but I'll be contacting everyone on Tuesday to gauge interest and see if you can make a practice [one or two game nights a week we can all get together and play just to coordinate]

Instead of typing a rant, I'll copy and paste. replace ""i park my car on the street"" with ""i park on campus"".




&gt;I live downtown. I park my car on the street across the road from my apartment building. Parking on the street is not ideal, but whatever. Parking is parking. Unfortunately this leaves my car readily accessible to being fucked with by every stupid motherfucker with something to advertise seeing my car as the most readily available medium to getting information directly to me. 


&gt; Every once in a while, you maggots will put some glossy propaganda for DJ WhatTheFuckEver's newest gig at Super Hot Club down the street on my windshield, attempting to temp me with $15 sink-or-swims and pictures of hawt girlz on the front. Most of the time this is merely annoying, another piece of shit to throw away a couple times a week. But today, today was a different day.


&gt;The glossy flyer strapped to my windshield underneath my wiper got wet last night, and now I have this fucking garbage essentially GLUED to my windshield!!! I have tried scraping it, scratching it, using washer fluid, EVERYTHING AND THE GODDAMNED SHIT WILL NOT COME OFF!!!!


&gt;If I see one of you fuckers putting any of this SHIT on my vehicle again, I will personally collect them from any parked cars in the vicinity and TAKE MY TIME SHOVING EACH ONE INDIVIDUALLY UP YOUR ASS! Nowhere in the history of anything has anybody ever pulled a flyer off their car and not been immediately enraged, and more so has actually taken the information into consideration and gone to a place that would engage in such slimy fucking behavior. It doesn't work! And it pisses people off! And occasionally it ruins their windshields!!!


&gt;So rest assured, if I have to go to any great lengths to get this crap removed from my car, I will be sending you the bill. If I have to replace my windshield, YOU will be replacing it. AND DON'T TOUCH MY CAR!!!

Fast forward a couple of days, I offer to rescue the bike, receive a map location via text and I'm heading out to retrieve said bike.

A little backstory: new girlfriend, not a lot of family history is known, etc. What I do know is that her BFF dad died from cancer a few years ago and the bike was his old Schwinn roadbike.

I get down to UCF at the pinpointed location and start looking for the bike: a blue, late 70s, early 80s metallic blue, skinny tire road bike. I ""find it"" and I look up UCF campus police number to call, I want to make sure they know what I'm doing and not stealing a bike. I find a number and get some ENTIRE UCF directory answering machine. 

Fuck that I don't have the time.

We make it as obvious as possible that we're there to cut the bike loose, take our time walking it back to the car and even get deadended in the parking lot as we're trying to leave. 

Fast-forward 2 days; the next time I see my girlfriend...


""I have a surprise for you!"" I exclaimed, and grabbed her hand as I skipped headlong to the garage, No. 2 faithfully in tow. ""I got your biiiiiike back!"" I bellowed triumphantly.

Same size, same color, same brand, same fucking decade.

""They stole my cork handlebar covers... And they switched out my back tire for a really old one!"" She handled the bicycle back and forth looking for more illegal modificatications.

I knew at 'cork handlebars' that I took the wrong bike.

Show me a picture of your bike and let me return it to you. Let me buy you some drinks at Tilted Kilt for your trouble.

Reflecting on the past year and a half, I can honestly say that I've never had a *good* meal there; it's always been just meh. You can tell a lot of the food is frozen, thawed, and served. A lot of the cooking seems half-assed. Odd vegetable and meat combinations make me feel like I'm eating leftovers. I've had some of the oddest concoctions at Knightro's, like chicken fingers in a tortilla with about 5 shreds of cole slaw on top. It's things like this that make me go, ""What?""

Maybe my standards are too high, but when you pay close to $3000 a year for the cheapest meal plan, you'd hope to see something decent. Would it kill them to put out some grilled chicken breasts to go on top of salads? I mean, c'mon. These are basics.

The one saving grace that makes me feel like I *might* be getting my money's worth is breakfast. I really do enjoy their breakfast and when I don't feel like cooking in the morning, it's very easy to go and eat well. They have an omelette station, yogurt and fruit, cereal, toast, oatmeal, bacon, etc. It's great, except that they don't serve breakfast on the weekend. Like, seriously?

Who would be interested in joining?,21,5,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/ucf/comments/xknvz/i_noticed_that_there_is_no_boxing_club_here_at/,"I don't know how the club process works, but if I generate enough interest in the student body making a boxing club successful shouldn't be too hard. The only big problems I see are how we are going to get a boxing ring, where we are going to put it, and how I'm going to get a trainer (which as long as you have enough experience you can qualify as one). Any feedback you guys give back is appreciated! If enough people want I can share my thoughts on what I brainstormed so far.



UPDATE: OK, so it has definitely generated enough interest for me to give it the go. I will start doing what I need to do to form the club after my finals are over (so after 8/7/12).

So now that I know there are people that want to join, I'll discuss some things I have been thinking, mainly fundraisers for now (because we need funds for any new equipment we will need). Here are some things I have came up with:  

Ways of raising money:  Fundraising
			         Adjust membership fee (Will be discussed later)
			         Donations (PAL, neighboring gyms, local businesses, begging letters, etc)

Possible fundraising ideas: Boxers for cancer! (half the proceeds go to research for cancer)
			           Test your punching power! (Dollar for 3 try, proceeds go to club)
			           Car wash at Autozone
			           Boxing Club shirts (Make them cheap, make a little profit to benefit both members and club)
			           Snacks at end of practice (Talk it up with members first)
			           PPV knights for boxing (maybe not fundraiser but a bonding thing instead)

Apparently similar rules have been in place at UF and FSU for some time. 

Personally, this won't stop me from smoking on campus, but I'll probably be more discreet about it. I'm an adult, not harming anyone other than myself when I smoke. I smoke cigarettes between classes, after tests, to relieve stress, and no honor system is going to stop me.

So a while back I mentioned that I wanted to start a boxing club, and so far have had good success! I've sent in the initial approval process form and have encountered three hurdles.

The first problem is members. I need at least 15 to start the club! So if you guys want to join and be a part of the first boxing club of UCF I'll need you to pm me for further instructions!

The second problem is the leadership. I currently have myself as president and someone else as a risk manager (in my old post I called her my vice president, but I have now realized the only officers needed are risk management, president, and treasurer). In your pm to me for further instructions on joining the club, let me know if you are interested in this as well. However, you must be SERIOUSLY INVOLVED if I pick you because, after all, we're starting a club here. A lot of work is needed.

The third and probably worst problem I have is the location. I was told I can't have it on campus (due to funding, I can elaborate if requested) and need to find an outside gym. I have contacted a couple through email but none have answered me yet. If any of you guys want to help me with this, know a place, or have a better suggestion, please comment below.

So all three of these things need to be resolved before the club can be approved. Now, it isn't necessarily guaranteed that the club will be started (it's ultimately up to the UCF faculty to decide), but there is little reason for them to turn it down and I have the UCF Sports Council President backing me up on this. 

Just like the last post, the more I hear from you guys, the better. Post away!

(Coming to UCF with my AA) I am majoring in Public Administration! But...here's the kicker: I don't know anyone from UCF. :-o

I have many interests, so I figured I could tell you guys a few and maybe there are already some of you in a club related to them...or maybe you just think we'd be friends. 

I love basketball. (Specifically our joke of a team, the Orlando Magic)

I play it...but I'm not very good. 5'5"" and can't dribble. Mainly spot up and shoot (mostly miss) threes...and tend to spend the game mindlessly cutting the lane and watching no one pass me the ball regardless of me being open. lol

I love board games, but I'm not afraid to admit that my catalog is small. I mainly play the beginner games...but if I find the right people I'd love to move beyond these games. I like Settlers of Catan, Munchkin, Ticket to Ride. 

I love government, but not politics...if that makes sense. (I believe more can be accomplished by local governments, so I try to steer clear of the national scene where many issues are just real life circlejerks)

I'm interested in helping in the community through volunteer work. This doesn't have any specific area really...I just want to get involved in the Orlando/UCF community and donate my free time.

I know in a student population nearing, or now at 60,000....there's gotta be some people out there like me. Even more likely that they are on Reddit. So...if our interests match, or you know a UCF club that fits my interests let me know. :) ",,False,,t5_2qh7r,False,,,True,t3_yjf0j,http://www.reddit.com/r/ucf/comments/yjf0j/hello_knights_im_new_to_your_giant_schoolcity/,

Try Swing Dancing! ,22,7,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/ucf/comments/qy2sx/need_something_to_do_on_a_friday_night_try_swing/,"It's Friday night. Once again, you find yourself replaying Bioshock or raging in League of Legends or chuckling at Barney's antics in HIMYM.  A bottle of vodka at hand, you eat hot pockets and Facebook stalk that girl/guy... you know the one.  This is fine, but if only there were something cheap you could do in a fun, energetic, and accepting atmosphere, maybe even something with guys and girls together...  

**Swing dance!** It's cheap, it's on campus, and it's fun! The facts:  
- Friday nights   
- Beginner lesson 8pm - 9pm  
- Dance 9pm - 12am  
- $6 (includes the lesson)  
- If you become a member, prices go down to $5 and you get 5 free dances for $25  
- It's in the Multipurpose Room (left of the gym) in the Education Complex (near garages A and I)

Bottom line: it's something fun to do on a Friday night. Girls, there are guys here. Guys, there are girls.  I've been going for almost 2 years and it's been great.  Lots of fun and good people.  It's also a very accepting atmosphere.  If you don't know how to dance, that's what the lesson is for!  The lesson is fun and simple and gives you a chance to meet some people as you rotate through partners.  

There's also Beginner's lesson on Wednesday nights at 8:30 for $1 (free for members) but this is progressive with each semester, so starting now might be challenging for new dancers (though still worth a shot). You can always start with at the beginning in the summer or fall! 

Well, thanks for reading this shameless plug.  Honestly, this is a great club that I enjoy a lot and we always want new people to come. I figured... why not Redditors? So come on out! If you're a lady, I'll dance with you! If you're a guy... um... we'll see :p

There is now a Florida-specific Redditor IRC channel based on R4R's channel. If you have been to the Gainesville or South Florida Meetup(Broward/Miami) we already have some friends you've met. There are a good number of Floridians from other places also. It is great to have an opportunity to meet more area redditors without leaving your house and perhaps later even in person. We would be very pleased to have some more people join in with us. The people are cool there and many topics are discussed, so even if you don't want to meet up it is a great place to be.


Please check them out by clicking here sometime and join in the fun:

Also if you didn't know R4R now has a chat for people meeting people from all of Reddit

*3) It implements Facebook so you don't need to register. Get in, Get out.

**Money**: It's about $482 a month which includes water and trash. Electricity is usually about 130 but we could definitely get it lower. There would be no move in fee and the security deposit is already covered.

If you have a cat or small dog you'd like to bring they are more welcome but then I think we should tell the apartment and start paying pet rent :)
**Personal Things:** I am a pretty laid back person. The only place in the apartment I really care that is clean is the kitchen because of roaches. I am an art and psychology major with interests in history and astronomy, so anyone with those common interests would be awesome. I'm always up for a lively debate!

She was stuck in the sewer, and was just the *tiniest* little thing (can't be more than 2 weeks old). We were worried about the rain getting to her, and her not being able to get out, so we finally coaxed her out of the pipe. I brought her home, fed her some chicken and milk (she was *hungry*), and now she's nestled in an old sleeping bag, passed out. Oddly enough, she has *zero* fleas or ticks on her, and was perfectly clean except for belly and legs which had mud all over them, so I'm led to believe someone may have just dropped her off near there, or in the sewer

I would love to keep her, but both my roommate and I are deathly allergic to cats. We're both loaded up on meds, eyedrops and nasal spray, but I don't think we could do that every day, so I'd like to find somewhere for her by tomorrow, if possible. If anybody has any resources, or something, please let me know!

It is way to hard to find a job, and I cannot seem to find the job I need to support myself ( I have been living with a friends for WAY too long now) and working at a cafe or serving tables is not my thing. So hopefully someone out there can help. If you need any more information and would like to help me out, contact me! Like I said! My first entire paycheck is yours. No strings attached.

Unfortunately, I'm 90% sure that I'm going to fail either Discrete or CS1 because I don't have the time to dedicate toward learning the material, and all of the TA office hours are unavailable for me. 

Basically I'm really struggling with the programming, and the more math related courses in my IT degree. I was under the impression that I would get to study more about networking, security and stuff like that, but instead all I've done is take programming courses, and a ton of ""computer science"" like courses. 

Where are all the networking and IT related stuff? 

I guess the most important question is this:
Unless I can move closer to UCF and not work so much, I fear that I'm never going to have enough time to dedicate toward the more difficult ""weeder"" courses.  

I have a fair amount of bills that need to be paid each month, and I'm not quite sure how to change my entire life; moving to UCF, quitting my job of 6 years and starting new... 

Would you do it and take the risk? Or take 2 classes at a time and graduate...years later?

Alright, so, Fall Semester, all my classes start at 8:30. From what you guys have said, I think, the first week or so, I'll try getting there an hour early, and trying my luck at C. And if that doesn't pan out, (which is what you guys are saying), I'll head to A.

My first class is in the Harris Engineering building, so that's why I was thinking of going to C. But if C is always full, I can go for A like you guys are saying.

Rent is $353 a month plus utilities which are split 5 ways.

Utilities are Water, High Speed Internet with Brighthouse 40MBPS!!!, HD Cable, Electricity. All of these combined usually will come out to $100 a month per person. 

Also, the rest of the house is already furnished we have a big screen TV, XBOX 360, PS3 with a bunch of games. Yes we are gamers! We also have a game room! with a big ping pong table, 2 car garage, everything you need we pretty much already have. All you have to bring is your own bedroom set.

You can apparently only put 1Hour on the meter and my class is scheduled for 1hr15mins. We sometimes get out early, so I was tying to bank on that. My friends said they usually dont start ticketing until 9, (My class was at 7:30).

So of course my class runs the full time and as I quickly get back to my car there he is, writing the ticket and taking the photos.

So here's my question, I have heard that you can let like 3 tickets go unpaid and they wont really come after you. Since I dont have a decal and the car is under my dads name, is there really any way they could hunt me down and get their $20? Like when I go next semester to actually get a decal when I can afford it will they look up my licence and know I have an outstanding charge?

1371836736.0,9,self.ucf,1gt1xe,Looking for a roommate to move in before August in apartment/house. Rent is roughly $350 a month per person.,14,5,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/ucf/comments/1gt1xe/looking_for_a_roommate_to_move_in_before_august/,"So! My name is Colton Younger. My roommate and I are looking for another roommate to live with us in our apartment for the next year. Our situation is a bit strange, but I'll get into those details in a second. First, the nitty gritty: rent would be roughly $350 a month. Total rent at this place is $860 and the internet is about $52. Electricity averages under $100, so that's why I say ROUGHLY $350. We've only ever gone over $100 once, but we wised up after that. Washer and dryer are included as well as a dishwasher. The room is 12x12 with a 5x2 closet. You'll have to share a bathroom with moi, but I'm not a slob I swear. There's no cable because neither of us watch TV, so take note of that. The apartment complex is called Knight's Landing.

HOWEVER. We are looking to move. This place has had a bug problem since we moved here ~2 years ago, and we're tired of dealing with. It's not disgusting that we refuse to live here anymore, but we'd rather be somewhere else. We've found a pretty sweet deal on a house that we're working the details on, so we very well might move there. If not, we still have this place and you're welcome to live with us here. But man that house looks cool. The tenant of that house is in England because they got transferred by their company. They aren't renting through a realtor so the rent is pretty damn cheap at $900 for a house. They'll be gone for 4-7 and mainly looking for people to keep the place clean and maintained until they get back. Which, hey, sounds like a sweet deal for college people. I plan on staying there until they get back, however, my roommate (Ryan by the way) is leaving sometime early next year. That means you and I could have to find another roommate if we so desired.

Either way, we're welcoming a roommate for the next year or so. Ryan and I are not dicks, I promise. I barely knew him when we moved in together and it's been pretty solid living together. We keep mostly to ourselves but we're not off-putting by any means. I'm majoring in industrial engineering and Ryan is working on his masters in teaching English to foreigners. We like...video games, I guess? I'unno. Best way to get to know us is to talk to us.

Pretty long for an ad for a roommate, but specifics are nice. Whether we stay in this apartment or move into the house, the price stays more or less the same. We'll know within the next week whether or not we're moving. If this sounds intriguing to you, feel free to send me a message and I can clear up any questions or show you some pictures of the house we're looking at (it's real nice) or the apartment. Peace!

tl;dr Two guys wanting a roommate with rent around $350 no matter what happens. Message me if you're interested.

Edit: Oh, uh, other personal information on Ryan and I might help. Um... I'm a 20/m and he's a 23/m. At least I think he's 23. I'm kinda short, he's kinda tall. Ryan works as a teacher at UCF (probably) whereas I myself am not employed. However, I get more than enough money from financial aid to pay for housing and classes. I've lived in this specific apartment for two years and Ryan's lived here for about a year-and-a-half, so there shouldn't be very much worry about making sure rent is paid. Oh, speaking of information, the tenant from the house we're trying to get wants a little info about all of us like current address and rent, previous address and rent, whether we have cars or pets, etc. So just keep that in mind if you're interested. And... nope, can't think of anything else. Hopefully I'll stop adding a bunch of frivolous drivel to this post so I don't clutter it more.

For those that don't know Coderunner is an iOS game that is currently on sale for $1.99, I decided to take the plunge since I had some credits left from those horrid itunes gift cards I get every Christmas, and wanted to see what the hype was about. 

I was very pleasantly surprised at how well developed this game is, in essence it's a very immersive ARG that uses GPS, Google maps, Voice &amp; video acting, etc. and it also has some Geocaching aspects to it as well.

Essentially the game starts with an intro video (reminded me of the whole Terminator 3D Intro at Universal) then in cuts a staticy message about how you are currently being followed, the game shows you a map with your current location and bugs you to get out of their, so I actually got off my lazy ass and went outside to play this, I didn't come back in for at least an hour, I can only imagine trying it out on campus with actual peopl playing and leaving ""drops."" Drops are essentially the geocaching part of the game, we the users set up these drops either virtually with an ARG aspect, or we place a physical drop with clues how to get it, the ""virtual"" drops can be anything from a security camera, ATM, power box etc. You as the ""Agent"" name and tag the location on your phone and snag a picture if you can, you set a password with something in the area, and leave your drop, then other players can access your drop. 

I've probably done a horrible job at explaining the game but it is extremely fun, it really is one of those ""you have to play it to get it"" type games, and it could be killer fun if we got enough of us at UCF playing and leaving drops.",,False,,t5_2qh7r,False,,,True,t3_qmizn,http://www.reddit.com/r/ucf/comments/qmizn/any_coderunners_in_rucf/,

Also there was an robbery by 4 men at knife point on campus that same night (probably unrelated).

I was wondering if we could get a thread started so if anyone had recommendations on complexes/housing areas that seem really safe near UCF we could compile a list, personally I'm thinking of moving or getting a gun for protection as I live by myself. However it seems crime is bad everywhere, the gun might only cause more problems.

I was also thinking we could compile a list of ways we could stay safe in or around campus for ourselves and our property (ie ways to secure your apartment windows if you're on the ground floor).

To change this: Click 'Settings' in the upper right corner. Check and see if the time zone is correct. If it is, then everything is fine; however, if it's not set to Eastern, click 'Edit Settings' on the right and locate 'Eastern Time (US &amp; Canada) (-05:00)' on the pulldown menu.

Monday November 26-December 1, 2012 (Orlando, Fla.) – Members of VOX: Voices for Planned Parenthood at the University of Central Florida have organized a week of action urging UCF students, faculty and Orlando community members to take control of their sexual health and get tested for Sexually Transmitted Diseases and Infections. During this week members of VOX will hold educational and interactive events on campus while providing resources for testing and information about STIs, closing out with an HIV/AIDS awareness rally on Friday November 30, 2012 in honor of World AIDS Day on December 1. 

	The GYT: Get Yourself Tested Week of Action will take place outside of the UCF Student Union from Monday November 26 to Friday November 30, 2012 from 10:00am – 2:00pm. 

	One in two sexually active young people will contract a sexually transmitted disease by the age of 25, and most won’t know it. Half of all new reported STIs last year occurred in people under the age of 25. This directly affects the UCF community. 

	VOX: Voices for Planned Parenthood at UCF knows how prevalent STIs are in Florida and especially Orange County and it is our goal to reduce the spread of these infections by providing information about the most commonly transmitted STIs, how and where to get tested, and engaging with the group most at risk, young people. 

	We will be handing out 500 condoms, 400 GYT Discount cards, and 100 GYT Safe Sex kits over the course of 5 days to UCF students and faculty who pledge to take control and empower themselves through preventative care by getting tested. 

	Senior Health Educator and Research Investigator at Planned Parenthood of Greater Orlando, Ebony Section says that “young people need to get tested so they can feel empowered by their health and have that peace of mind.” Research shows that the sooner a sexually active person knows their status with that STI test, the sooner treatment can start and the fewer health complications can result if that test was positive. “STIs are more common than young people think, but most are curable and all are treatable” says Lisa Phillips, Research Liaison with the Teen Health Empowerment Study	

Planned Parenthood of Greater Orlando tests for Chlamydia, Gonorrhea, Syphilis, HIV and Herpes for $79.00. 

About VOX: Voices for Planned Parenthood at UCF

One of my friends (20, F, taken) is moving into The Arbours by UCF and her roommate just dropped out on her on move-in day.  She's a nice, clean, cheerful, and otherwise quiet girl.  

Are there any redditors still looking for an apartment?  I believe it's a 2/2 for $420 including water and internet after the split.  If you're interested send me a PM and I'll forward your information on.  Figured there'd be a better chance of finding a good roommate here than her taking chances on craigslist.
