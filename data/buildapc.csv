Quick note to the mods: Apologies to the mods for this spam - but I have to run through the halls screaming this I'm so excited about it.  :)

As many of you know, my name is Philip, and I've been developing PCPartPicker (http://pcpartpicker.com) as a side project for roughly two years now.  I've also been busy with a full-time job, and am a husband and father of two kids under 3 (one of which was born during the last year... hence a slower than normal dev rate on the site).  The work load has been a bit more than I've been able to keep up with lately.  I haven't been able to improve PCPartPicker as well as I'd like.  That is about to change.

I turned in my two-week notice last week, so starting end of Friday I will be transitioning to working full-time on the site.  I am so unbelievably excited, and **even more thankful to everyone on /r/buildapc for your support**.  I started this because I love it - not for money - and now get to do it as my full-time job.  It is truly a dream come true.  I've been for all of you from the beginning, but now I'll have even more time to dedicate to everything.

Know that I listen closely to your feedback, and work diligently to incorporate what I can.  As always, I love to hear your feedback and suggestions.  The best way to reach me is via email at philip@pcpartpicker, but you can also PM me here on Reddit.

I look forward to further serving this community.  I've got some killer features in the pipeline that I can't wait to show everyone.  The best is yet to come!

Cheers,

Philip

**EDIT** Thank you to everyone for asking how to support the site.  Several people have asked if I take donations - I don't.  The best way to support the site is to spread the word and tell your friends.  Thanks!

**EDIT #2** 12 hours later - wow, you all are awesome.  I am so encouraged by what you've all said.  This confirms even more that I made the right decision.  To everyone that has sent in feedback, suggestions, and offers for help - thank you, and I will do my best to respond to all of you (though it make take me a bit to catch up).",,False,,t5_2rnve,1340686199.0,,pcpartpicker,True,t3_vksl8,http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/vksl8/thank_you_buildapc_im_leaving_my_job_to_focus/,

It occurred to me that there really wasn't any reason that  could think of that he couldn't build a computer of his own.  I've already outfitted a netbook with Sugar (OLPC) on it for his amusement, so he already likes computers.

The following are the rules for the build:

1)  Each week, we head down to Microcenter and get one part for the computer.
2)  We decide together what part we'll need for the week (i.e. case, fans, etc)
3)  When we get to the store, my son gets to pick whatever part he wants from that category for installation on the computer.
4)  We pay for it and head to Chick-fil-A (his favorite place to eat).
5)  When we get home, my son installs the part with my help.

So far, the build is going well.  Here are his choices to this point:

*  Case:  Cooler Master HAF 912 case.  He originally wanted to go for one of those bright red plastic deals, but I convinced him that something sturdy might be better.  Of course, he went for the hugest case he could find.  Cost:  $58

*  Case fans:  2 x 120 mm.  One is a Xigmatek, the other is an Antec.  Both, of course, have LEDs on them... he insisted that one be red and the other blue.  Cost:  $40 ($20 each)

*  DVD-ROM drive.  For some reason he insisted that he get one on week 3 and also insisted on the cheapest one available.  I'm not complaining.  Cost:  $18

*  Power supply:  Thermaltake TR500 PSU.  He was surprisingly adamant that this was the one despite the fact that I couldn't see anything particularly exciting about it that would catch his eye.  Cost:  $43.

So, at this point, we've got a very incomplete computer for $159.  If anybody is interested, I'll keep updating as more as we continue.

AN UPDATE (5/26/13):  We're still working on the project, but because it's only one piece a week, I'll probably post every month or so.  Last week he got a refurbished 320 GB Western Digital hard drive, and this week he got himself a card reader for one of the little drive bays.  Somehow, he lost a pair of tweezers in the case during the card reader installation, but we expect they'll turn up somewhere.",,False,,t5_2rnve,1369580693.0,,,True,t3_1egh9u,http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/1egh9u/can_a_4yearold_build_a_computer/,

**Building a Gaming PC**

---

Well, this is a rather generic guide, you say. You would be right there. And it probably won't be relevant for long until it needs updating, as I will be talking in terms of specific parts and narrowing your choices down. Ive been meaning to write it for a while, but with the 100k subscriber competition on /r/buildapc going on I may as well do it now and have a chance of winning. Good luck to you all if you are entering.

It can be rather intimidating to have a whole pcpartpicker list of CPUs, all slightly different and with different stats - but actually 90% of the products can be discarded straight away as they won't be relevant to your uses. Most people end up choosing a cookie cutter build, which isn't necessarily wrong but you haven't truly understood why that processor should be chosen above all the others. I hope to give some background knowledge to the various viable part choices, at least for gaming PCs.

The first thing you will want to consider is the *budget*, of course. Spending more will always net you more performance in one way or another. Whether you can see the increase in performance depends on your monitors! On a standard 1080p 60Hz monitor which most people use, there is a limit to the amount of graphical power needed to get 60fps in every game on max settings. You can always turn ridiculous antialiasing settings on etc but I would say that a 7970 is all you currently need with a standard monitor and you will be set.

---

**CPUs**

---

**[A8-5600K](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/amd-cpu-ad560kwohjbox)/[A10-5800K](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/amd-cpu-ad580kwohjbox)** For the very low budgets, where you can't even afford a decent video card along with a CPU, youll want to be looking at an APU. These chips have very good integrated graphics comparable with a low end discrete video card and will be able to handle your basic gaming needs (at 30fps and 720p for instance) just fine. These are a good choice for a HTPC or console alternative build too. The A8-5600K and A10-5800K are the current newest APUs in the lineup, on the FM2 socket.

**[G630](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/intel-cpu-bx80623g630)/[G850](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/intel-cpu-bx80623g850)** Now an APU build can easily go up in price until you can get an Intel Pentium G630 processor and a low end GPU like a 7770. At that point, you definitely want to be going for a discrete GPU as it will perform much better even with the relatively poor performing CPU. Look at the Pentium G630/G850 as choices around this area, as they are priced better than the incremental steps around them (620/840 etc)

**[FX-6300](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/amd-cpu-fd6300wmhkbox)/[i3-3220](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/intel-cpu-bx80637i33220)** Heres where the ""good"" category gaming builds come in where you can start to enjoy 60fps @ 1080p in most games. At this price point there is the i3-3220 and FX-6300 from Intel and AMD respectively. At the moment these are very competitively priced and either is a good choice, but personally I would go for the FX-6300. It is ~2-5% worse in gaming performance yet 30% better for heavily multithreaded tasks. You also get overclocking should you decide to in the future. I wouldn't recommend buying a cooler from the start, as often you spend as much combined that you could get an i5-3470 for the same price.

**[i5-3470](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/intel-cpu-bx80637i53470)** Not overclocking? Want to spend more on the GPU? This is a very good choice of CPU for a mid-high end gaming rig. More performance than you will need for general gaming so you are set for quite a while to come, as well as being able to get good performance in more CPU intensive games. You also save a ton of money by not overclocking as you can get a cheaper motherboard and don't have to pay for the cooler. If you 'might' overclock 'in the future' I would actually advise you just skip out on it and spend the money on graphics.

**[i5-3570k](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/intel-cpu-bx80637i53570k)** A /r/buildapc favourite right here. For good reason too. I see it recommended a little too much for people who clearly have no interest in overclocking though. If you do want to overclock, and are willing to push the CPU as far as it will go (or if you have the budget to buy a 7970 already and want to spend a little more in this area) then the i5-3570k is the choice for you.

**[i7-3820](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/intel-cpu-bx80619i73820)** Why skip the i7-3770k? Well [Ive discussed this topic in a lot of detail here](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/164qx0/psa_i73820_the_x79_chipset_and_gaming/) so I won't go into it. The only benefit of an i7-3770k over an i5-3570k is the hyperthreading which games don't take advantage of, whereas with the 3820 you get extra PCIe lanes for dual card setups.

**[FX-8350](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/amd-cpu-fd8350frhkbox)** sits below the i5 in terms of gaming performance but is very good for streaming and multi threaded tasks where the extra cores come in handy. Just don't bring up Logan's video to use in an argument for it :D

---

**CPU Coolers**

---

Not overclocking? Don't want insane quiet operation? **Use the stock cooler**. The exception to this is the i7-3820 - as it is an enthusiast CPU there is no stock cooler bundled with it.

For moderate overclocking a [**Cooler Master 212 Evo**](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/cooler-master-cpu-cooler-rr212e20pkr1) will do you proud, but it is pretty loud as far as aftermarket CPU coolers go. That being said the performance for the money is absolutely fantastic.

If you really want to push things and already have a higher end CPU selected, go for a really high end air cooler. These are huge, but will fit in 99% of mid tower cases just fine. Some options are the [**Phanteks PH-TC14PE**](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/phanteks-cpu-cooler-phtc14pe), the [**Noctua NH-D14**](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/noctua-cpu-cooler-nhd14) and the **Thermalrite True Spirit 140**.

If the aim is silence over performance, I would recommend the [**Gelid Tranquilo**](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/gelid-solutions-cpu-cooler-cctranq01a) or buying a cheap 120mm cooler like the 212 evo and replacing the fan on it with a dead silent one (but this is a pricier option)

Water cooling you say? Very expensive but it is absolutely amazing for cooling. I would only recommend it if you have already splashed out on at least an i7-3820 and dual 7970s, and plan to push them as far as they will go. The **XSPC kits** are a fantastic starting point, but if you are spending this much money you should really be planning out a loop and buying all the parts which suit your build best.

Oh you meant a CLC (closed loop cooler)? These are meh. You can get the same performance out of air cooling for less cost and it will be a lot quieter - the stock fans on current CLCs on the market tend to be high rpm to get good cooling temps. However there are advantages: because all the heat dissipation goes on at the radiator, it leaves the space around the socket. This also brings the advantage that it makes the build look a lot cleaner. All in all though, I wouldn't recommend them. Avoid Corsair CLCs, as a lot of people have had issues with the software and pump grinding issues even with the new ""i"" generation.

Thermal paste - [fills the microscopic air gaps between the CPU and the heatsink base to improve heat dissipation](http://www.hardwarelogic.com/articles/guides/Thermal_Paste/Heastsink_diagram.jpg). All coolers will come with enough for a few applications, and some come with the thermal paste screen printed to the bottom (the stock cooler and most CLCs). You want to apply a BB-sized ball in the centre of the CPU and use the heatsink to apply even pressure to spread it out. Simple as that. If you really mess up or want to reapply, remove the heatsink and you will need to clean the old paste off with Isopropyl Alcohol or [ArctiClean](http://www.amazon.com/ArctiClean-60ml-Kit-30ml/dp/B0007TOR08/) before applying new thermal paste and replacing the heatsink again.

It went into one of my earliest custom-built machines. I pulled it out to snap a pic, here it is with my raid card (my machine no longer has an IDE port, so it's bolted into this bad boy): [428.1 MEGABYTES!](http://i.imgur.com/gvSqxnF.jpg)

Years passed, computers came and went, but that little drive followed me. I kept putting it in my new machine. At first it was to save money, and then it became a bit of a joke. 20 years on, it's a goddamned legend. Here it is in my latest machine: [In my newest machine...](http://i.imgur.com/9xkTrtE.jpg)

As of now, this thing has been in operation for over 20 years. In 20 years, it's only been formated -one- time, back in 1994 (thanks to a nasty virus). It's spooling as we speak in my newest rig, built at the end of last month. Wanna see what's on it?

I'll keep this SFW by not sharing any vintage 1994 porn. And yeah, some of you might wonder what's in the ""coolstuf"" directory. Well, rest assured, it's cool stuf. For example, back then I was part of a group of guys who more recently became a bit better known... Moved to California, brought my hard drive, had some good times, won't be sharing my handle: [A Mystery...](http://i.imgur.com/ZBqk8rc.jpg)

For reference, here is a little [blast from the past](http://web.archive.org/web/20100605035814/http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc).  Many of you won't remember that there was actually a time before [pcpartpicker](http://pcpartpicker.com/) as well!  How did we even manage?  If you are so inclined, take a look at the official statistics for our sub over on stattit at http://stattit.com/r/buildapc/

Now the moment you have all been waiting for...  How will we celebrate?  Later this week we will be announcing a series of contests and giveaways for all our subscribers to participate in.  This will be the largest group of vendors and prizes we have ever had for a giveaway.  As a result, each vendor or manufacturer has different restrictions on shipping so while some may be worldwide others may be region restricted.  In order to try and make the contest as fair as possible, we will only be accepting entries from accounts that are at least one month old and have at least 50 comment karma.

**Finally, we are looking to you, the community, for some awesome contest or giveaway ideas (NOT prizes - We have plenty of those!).**  We have been brainstorming up some things we think you will enjoy but we would love your input as well.  Please let us know in the comments what kinds of contests you would like to see!  To motivate you all into action I give you my favorite [winning contest](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/k1mte/contest_me_gusta_me_and_my_pc/c2gum2f) entry courtesy of /u/tito13kfm.

Thanks again for all your hardwork and dedication, we really couldn't have done this without all of you,

And while they may be sound suggestions, these all undermine the concept of a budget. The budget is there to limit us from overspending beyond our means at that particular moment in time. It's not even appropriate to tell a user to save up a little more because there will always be something just a tad better for just a morsel more. The 670 can be found for just $20 more than the 7950. The 7970 can be found just $30 more than the 670, and so on ad nauseum until you've realised that you're spending $100 more on a video card.

I had a similar problem when trying to find the right keyboard for my needs. My old Logitech multimedia keyboard from the 11-year-old Logitech MX Elite Duo keyboard and mouse combo lasted just as long and I was in the market for another keyboard that was both cheap, but combined discrete multimedia keys (because I hate trying to press the Fn key and one of the F keys with one hand) with some gaming macro capability. This right mix was the Logitech G110, which I bought today and I love it, but someone had recommended a Cherry Blue mechanical keyboard that costs $130. That's $70 more than the keyboard I picked out and $50 more than my allotted budget. $50 is a lot of money and not something I can afford when I need something imminently, and while I understand that mechanical keyboards generally last longer, that's besides the point (and may not necessarily be true since I eat and drink beverages in front of my keyboard).

Anyway, I just wanted to get something off my chest about a frustrating trend I've been seeing.",,False,,t5_2rnve,False,,,True,t3_18awjq,http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/18awjq/psa_dont_force_users_to_raise_their_budget/,

I had mentioned that I installed Windows using my flash drive instead of the disc and it was much faster. I received a lot of messages from people wanting to know more. It is pretty simple, but I realize many people may not know about it. This is great if you are ready to ditch the disc drive, lost your install DVD, don't yet have service pack 1, or if you just want a quicker install. All you need is a USB drive that is at least 4GB.

The amount of legitimate comments by nVidia owners being downvoted simply because they...OWN nVIDIA cards is deplorable! 

As a GTX 670 owner, let me say that I am ecstatic that AMD's drivers have the HD 7xxx series ahead! This is wonderful news for the gaming community as more and more people can enjoy superior gaming experiences, and of course the good old free market always needs some healthy competition! So, congratulations AMD owners and fellow gamers!

That said, the sheer amount of AMD fanboyism (their is certainly also some nVidia fanboyism) in the aforementioned thread is inexcusable. AMD's driver issues are being downvoted upon their immediate mentioning, yet individuals such as myself have gone through very real and very frustrating experiences. We can not even mention our experiences without receiving a truckload of downvotes. In fact, many posts boiling down to ""I love my GTX ..."" are being downvoted and I am not sure why!

My personal story is irrelevant to my main point, but its tl;dr form is as follows: I went through three HD 7970s upon release, and had the same driver issues with all three of them (BSOD's/crashing upon sleep resume, PCIe bandwidth randomly downclocking to x1 speeds requiring a restart, Skyrim experiencing abysmal flickering). I ended up getting a GTX 670 and experienced no such issues. Am I hating on AMD? No. **As a hardware junky, giving up on their 3GB of dedicated VRAM, superior bus size, and incredible GPUGPU potential was quite depressing for me.** And, as previously stated, I am truly happy that such impressive hardware is realizing its potential! But my experience is real and it happened, and to be dismissed as a fanboy is insulting and demeaning, and completely unnecassary.

**I AM NOBODY'S FANBOY. I will go with WHOEVER gives me the best experience. I really don't give a shit.** It was previously nVidia, now it is AMD. It's a pendulum. You guys are BETTER than this.

So I was ordering CPUs recently for benchmarking on [PCPartPicker](http://pcpartpicker.com), and accidentally bought an extra Intel Core i5-3470...  blame sleep deprivation on that.  (Haven't been getting a lot of sleep lately trying to get some features pushed out.)  Anyhow, I figured rather than go through the return process I'd contribute it to BuildAPC for the 75K milestone.  I've also got a few other things I'm going to throw into the mix to make this more fun.

**Prizes**

* [Intel Core i5-3470 CPU](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/intel-cpu-bx80637i53470)

And as an added incentive, if the donations to Computers for Youth (see the donation link in the sidebar) reach $1000 by the end of the day tomorrow, I'll also throw in this:

* ~~EVGA GeForce GTX 660 Ti Video Card~~ ($1000 threshold not met by EOD 9/17)

* I'll ship anywhere legally possible from the US.  (Sorry North Korea residents.)
* You must be registered on reddit prior to today.
* **For the CPU and hard drive (and video card if the threshold is met)...** The mods will select the most useful user generated post, starting from a week ago to a week from now (Sunday 9/9 through Sunday 9/23).  (i.e. guides, original content, etc.)
* **For the CPU Cooler and RAM...** The mods will choose the funniest photo or photoshop depicting a cpu cooler or RAM.  Be original, be creative, and have fun.  (Cannot be NSFW.)  Post your submission in this thread, and I'll collect all of them for mod voting next Sunday (9/23).
* **For the shirts and stickers...** Any reply to this post qualifies you for either one of the shirts, or one of the stickers.  Winners in this category will be chosen by a random number generator.  If you win a shirt, I'll message you for your shirt size.

I'm pleased to announce that PCPartPicker now supports Newegg combo deals for US and Canada.

Combo deals are important when trying to find the best deals, but with thousands available finding the best savings can be tricky and time consuming.  So now PCPartPicker automatically searches over 3,000 combo deals to find the permutation of deals that offer the greatest overall savings for your part list.

For a given part list, there may be a hundred or more different permutations of combo deals available.  I evaluate each permutation of deals, factoring in the effects of those deals, prices from your preferred retailers, nearby local-only deals, promotions and coupon codes, mail-in rebates, taxes, and shipping.  The best combination of deals is presented and broken down part by part, with a list of which promotions and combo deals offer the largest savings.

When you choose parts, combo icons indicate which parts offer combo deals - both in general and in combination with parts you've already picked out.  Part detail pages also list available deals.

With the initial rollout for this feature, it is currently limited to Newegg.com and Newegg.ca combo deals of only two items.  Once I have a better idea of the extra load this will add on the server, I intend to support deals with three or more parts and from additional retailers.

Oh, and cake day!  :)

Cheers,

Philip (PCPartPicker)

They're going up. Fast.

Basically, there are a few factors that contribute to this:

1. When windows 8 was launched, all the major manufacturers started stockpiling. Windows 8 wasn't as successful as everyone wished it was, so everyone stopped production and started clearing out stock. That was a few months ago. Now, there still is little production and stocks are getting low, therefore prices up.

2. Copy/paste point 1 with AMD's Piledriver.

3. The mobile and tablet market are taking off, so a lot of focus has been shifted from desktops to making chips for tiny little mobile devices. 

4. Chinese New Year. Those son o' bitches party for a freakin' month. No one goes to work, nothing gets made. Availability falls, and prices rise.

When we ordered a bunch of Kingston 4GB sticks back in October, they were about $16 CAD. Now we pay double that.

I'm willing to learn and I'm confident.

I'm 14 years old by the way. I've read on here of people that built a pc when they were 12 years old and such which is part of what makes me confident.

So.. what do you guys think I should do?

I was planning on building it for the summer for recording gaming videos etc. from around $1000-1500.

Edit: I already have the money for it.

Edit 2: If you have any videos that you think would help me learn as well, I'd appreciate it if you would post them, thanks. :)

Edit 3: I didn't expect this to get as much attention as it's getting so far, thank you guys, I've read every single reply. :3

Edit 4: Alright, I'm gone to watch LCS, keep the replies and discussion going, I'll check back later on. c:

Edit 5: I just did a quick refresh and I have so many messages and this is #1 on the subreddit right now. This is amazing. I know this isn't really the place to ask this question but people were telling me I shouldn't ask the people in /r/buildapcforme to build me a pc so I was wondering if anyone would be willing to get together a build so I can order it this week. I know I'm asking for a lot here but since this has gotten a lot of attention I figured I would put it here. I don't expect anyone to do it but I mean, it doesn't hurt to try. :p

What I'm looking for: A gaming pc between $1000-1500 (but I can maybe go a bit over if I beg a bit) where I can get at least a steady 60 fps while recording games like League of Legends, Civ V and possibly Battlefield 4 but that may be pushing it. I'm going to be recording games from my Xbox and PS4 when it comes out in the future using an Elgato Game Capture and I'm gonna be using a Blue Snowball Microphone to record my voice. I need everything that goes inside the pc itself, a monitor and an OS (whichever one you recommend) and if you could include a cheap keyboard and mouse for now that'd be great. I live in Newfoundland, Canada, unfortunately not near a microcenter. I'd rather have the pc be quiet. I think it'll need quite a bit of USB plug ins because of the Elgato, Blue Snowball mouse and keyboard too. I may want to overclock depending on if it's difficult or not.

Some people have heard of it. Ask me anything.

Some quick facts:

- I am currently ranked [3rd in the US in subzero overclocking, 42nd in the world](http://hwbot.org/user/i.m.o.g./)
- I only regularly overclock with LN2, and I buy 150-300 liters of LN2 monthly
- I don't own a desktop PC, and I don't overclock on a daily basis
- I designed the current editorial framework of the site, recruited an all volunteer staff, and also manage our forums
- I registered on Overclockers Forums as a regular member over 10 years ago, which lead to my first career, as well as my current one

EDIT:
- My personal best CPU clock is [8.235GHz, 14th highest in the world](http://hwbot.org/submission/2225833_i.m.o.g._cpu_frequency_fx_8120_8235.25_mhz). It was more impressive a year ago when it was the 5th highest frequency ever.

Most of the components is custom designed and made, and almost all of the watercooling is home-made. The acrylic plates above the motherboard is connecting all major components in one big plate, reducing tubing by quite a deal.

**EDIT**

To all the guys asking ""why not use titan cards and more storage?""

All parts was bought in January/february and everything custom in the build is build around those components.

Storage: Client has a 12 tb NAS server, so the internal 4 tb is only for temporary lulz.

To all the people awaiting the video game settings guide: Don't worry, I'm still making it! I have been working hard over the past couple of days to get as much as I can finalized and ready for public release.

The guide is larger than a self post allows (max is 15,000 characters. The guide sits at about 21,000 right now) so I talked with the moderators and we plan to make a wiki page with all the information there so anybody can discuss and edit it.

As far as a release goes, I want to get as much proofreading I can get done, done before I even think about that. Not to mention that it needs to be fact checked and some of the example photos still have to be made. Given the amount of stuff I was able to get done in just 3 days, it looks like next week is going to be around when its ready.

I then remembered that I read/heard something somewhere about the frequency of RAM being locked in the BIOS to ensure that the RAM booted with the system. 

This is a really simple thing to fix, but something which I realise a lot of people are unaware of. If you brought RAM which was advertised at running at a specific frequency higher than 1333HMz, then you must manually change this in the BIOS. (There may be some cases where it changes automatically, I did not research too much into this subject if I'm honest)

To change the frequency of the RAM to what is advertised, you must simply go into your BIOS (spam either the Del or F2 key on bootup) and if you are using the new UEFI BIOS, then look for a tab labeled Overclocking or something similar, and if not, then scroll through the different tabs until you come across an option called ""DRAM Frequency"". All you have to do is change this option to your advertised frequency (for me it was 1600HMz). Remember to save the changes before you exit and there you go, all done! :)

*(Also, some motherboard manufacturers have an accessible BIOS program in the OS, I happen to have an MSI motherboard so used ClickBIOS2 and did all of this in my OS which was much easier)*

**TL;DR - Your RAM may be advertised at a higher frequency than what the system is currently allowing, to get your money's worth and the most out of your RAM, you must change the DRAM frequency in the BIOS (For steps on how to do this, read the third paragraph)**

It's a bit over the top, but if it helps me beat manirelli in some games, I'll consider it worth the investment.

Ok, just kidding.  This build will serve as a test bed of sorts for some benchmarking and analysis features we have coming in the future.  The parts will likely get swapped in and out as we iterate through different GPUs, CPUs, etc.  For that reason, we didn't go with a custom water cooling loop given the outrageous budget.

Before anyone jumps on the (pricey) choice of RAM, here's what was going on:  I wanted &gt; DDR3-1600 RAM, while keeping with a Black/Grey/Orange color scheme.  I also wanted to stay within Intel's published spec and hold the RAM voltage at 1.5V.  That left me with very few options.  The Dominator RAM fit the spec and aesthetic requirements.

Thanks go out to /u/NZXT_Retell and [NZXT](/r/nzxt) for providing the H630.  I can honestly say the case is awesome to work with.  I wanted something that was cleanly designed, simple (in appearance), and easy to work with.  It fit that perfectly.

Thanks also go out to /u/Jappetto, who made the custom sleeved cables you see in the video and pictures.  I'd like to take a moment to say how awesome of a job he did.  Seriously awesome.  Get this: He custom makes the lengths so the cable management is perfect.  Only the H630 wasn't available for purchase when I asked him about cables.  So he picked up a Phantom 630 (as the internal dimensions are similar/identical) and used that as his template.  That's a crazy level of service.  And the cables look fantastic, btw.

&amp;nbsp;

Without further ado:

**[Build Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5b2XSxJJ1c)**

**[Pictures](http://imgur.com/a/pZ12m)** - Just a few for now, but you can see from these how awesome Japetto's cables are.  I'm waiting on a fan controller and an extra sleeved cable.  Once those are in, I'll clean things up a bit more.

&amp;nbsp;

We'll be putting this system through its paces soon, including some fun analysis that I think everyone will enjoy.  Testing out the gaming on it will likely result in manirelli trouncing me again in CS:GO, in which case I'll have to blame my ISP ping time... otherwise it might have something to do with skill level (pfffft).",,False,,t5_2rnve,1372698935.0,,pcpartpicker,True,t3_1hflfa,http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/1hflfa/build_complete_i73960x_3way_sli_titan_nzxt_h630/,

**Day 1** - I need to get my paint and disassemble my case. All of my hardware is in there so it will take some time to get that done. I am working the real job today so most of this is after hours. I refuse to be the OP that doesn't deliver and will keep updating and answering comments. Rather than keep you in the dark this whole time I'll give you guys a homework assignment for those who are serious about getting their cases painted. **Take as many pictures as possible while you take your PC apart.** Every case is different. those who kept the box and manual will be glad they did especially if that manual tells you how to take it apart.

I was so busy looking at all the larger problems it could be, and didn't once think to just look at temperatures. My heat sink on my processor had come lose somehow, and the thing was reaching almost 70c and locking up. After reapplying thermal paste and tightening the processor, It's down to 25c idle, and around 30-35 maxed out.

All of my FPS issues with games are now gone, and I feel like an IDIOT.

This will do all the daily tasks needed in a computer: web browsing, MS Office tasks, and also some light gaming (Think: TF2, Minecraft). It also has an SSD, so it will be lightning fast in every noticeable regard. Great for parents that just need a plain 'ol computer.

So this shouldn't be anything new: an FX 6300 should do the trick for most games and it does slightly bottleneck the 760 (at least I think a 6300 would bottleneck a GPU with 670 levels of power), but it should be a strong performer in most games. This should max out some games and play most on high-very high settings. No SSD here because the average gamer doesn't need fast boot-ups, but rather more space for games. A great, affordable, all around good gaming rig.

This is a great build. The 4670K should not bottleneck any card in any game for many years to come, especially with the CPU cooler and overclocking-friendly motherboard. The GPU, a 7950, is very overclock-friendly and is a beast at stock clocks. There's also an SSD for the OS and commonly used programs. If you want all of your games to look amazing, look no further.

Great performance all around. The 3820 is last gen's Sandy Bridge-E but it's the only one out there for LGA2011. There's an upgrade path to IVB-E but once we get to Haswell-E there will probably be a socket change. LGA 2011 allows for quad-channel memory and has more bandwidth on its PCI slots. This allows for faster and more RAM overall and also doesn't bottleneck SLI'd or xFire'd cards as much as other sockets do. Also, with the 770, you get CUDA cores that will accelerate most editing tasks. Adobe Premier uses CUDA. This is a build for gamers and editors alike.

Ok, I admit that sitting at a laptop for ~20 minutes compiling lists for others does get a little boring. So here's the result of my boredom, a powerful, somewhat all-out primarily editing computer.

Ok, this is the most budget-friendly editing (and BEASTLY gaming) build. If you have a multi-monitor setup (which most people seeking this power do), then this is perfect for you. The 3930k has 6 cores and 12 threads, making it perfect for editing processes that require many threads. The SLI'd 780s have the CUDA cores mentioned above, and they're basically GTX Titans with less VRAM. That's OK though, 3 GB is still quite a lot. It should push 1440 and triple 1080p setups well. If you want a to some extent future-proof, top of the line PC, then this is for you. **EDIT** If you're primarily going to be video editing, swap the 2 780's for this:

I know a lot of you already understand these concepts, and sources can be found that probably explain it better than I will, but I thought it would be nice to provide something that could shed a little light for newer builders on the mechanics of graphics cards and VSync's interactions with them. It's basically something I would have liked to have had when I first started browsing /r/buildapc. Feel free to downvote to oblivion if it's not helpful or necessary, and I'll promptly delete it and most likely not post again until my self esteem has returned and I'm done crying in the fetal position. Okay.. 

In order to provide a decent understanding, there are certain mechanics and distinctions I need to cover first.

I'll start with the difference between Frame Rate and Refresh Rate. Most of us are familiar with these but I've sometimes seen them mixed up or mistakenly used interchangeably. It's important to note they're not the same. 

**Frames Per Second** refers to the amount of frames/images your computer can generate per second (generally through the use of discrete graphics card). The more frames per second you are seeing, the smoother the image will be. The **Refresh Rate**, on the other hand, is how many frames your monitor can refresh per second. This rate is indicated through hertz.

What's important to keep in mind here is that it generally doesn't matter how many frames per second your card can generate as long as the number is equal to or above your monitor's refresh rate. Most monitors are 60hz, meaning it can only display a maximum of 60 frames per second. Less common are 120hz monitors that can display a maximum of 120 frames per second, but if you're not sure how many hertz your monitor is, then it's 60hz. So if you have a 60hz monitor and your graphics card is rendering a consistent 60 fps, you're seeing the smoothest picture your setup can manage. Of course it's rarely, if ever, that perfect.

The next thing to explain is the **Frame Buffer**. To provide a crude explanation of what's going on behind the scenes, the game is essentially sending information to your graphics card, the graphics card takes this information and generates an image or frame in the Frame Buffer, and then shortly sends it to the monitor's display. The Frame Buffer is where these images are temporarily stored (in the graphics card's VRAM) before making their way to the monitor. 

There are usually two buffered images held at any one time, and they are placed in the graphics card's Primary and Secondary Buffers (also referred to as the Front and Back Buffer, respectively). The image in the Primary Buffer is the one being displayed on your screen while the image generated in the Secondary Buffer is the image to follow. When it's time for the next frame to be displayed, the Secondary Buffer becomes the Primary Buffer (and therefore displays the image onto the screen), while what was previously the Primary Buffer becomes the Secondary Buffer and begins rendering the next image. Your graphics card does this dance as fast as possible in order to provide you with as many frames per second it can manage.

Now with a basic understanding of Frames Per Second, Refresh Rates, and the Frame Buffer, you should hopefully be able to understand what causes **Tearing**. An example of image Tearing can be seen [here](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/03/Tearing_%28simulated%29.jpg). Tearing is generally the result of a powerful graphics card or a very non-demanding game. It's caused when your graphics card generates more frames per second than your monitor can handle (i.e. when the FPS &gt; than your monitor's refresh rate). What happens is that your graphics card generates several images in the Frame Buffer before any one of them has been sent to your monitor, so when the image is finally sent it will actually be the result of more than one image overlapping. In other words, information regarding multiple frames will be sent to your monitor to display at once. 

Say, for example, that part of the image contains what should have been displayed at the 15 second mark and the other part consists of what should have been displayed at the 16 second mark. In the time between those images, your view may have veered slightly to the right, so part of the image will look slightly further to the right while the other part is still straight on. The image is therefore misaligned at parts, resulting in the tearing effect.

Another way to put this is to say the graphics card and monitor have gone out of sync: the graphics card is kicking out frames faster than the monitor can display them. This is where **VSync** enters the picture. VSync literally stands for ""Vertical Synchronization."" Its job is to make sure the images vertically align, and it does this by making the graphics card a slave to the monitor. 

With VSync enabled, the graphics card is told to wait for the monitor's signal before generating and sending a newly completed image for display. This would limit the frames per second to the refresh rate, meaning it will at most display 60 fps on a 60hz monitor and no more. As explained earlier, this gives you the smoothest possible image the setup can provide. So you might ask, why not always keep VSync on? Because even though it solves the issue of tearing (when your graphics card renders more frames per second than your monitor can handle), the results are drastically different when your graphics card generates frames at a rate lower than your monitor's refresh rate. In that situation, it will actually reduce your *Frame Rate* to 50% of the *Refresh Rate* (and sometimes even lower). 

This is probably the hardest concept to articulate, so forgive me if I'm not extremely clear. Let's assume this situation: you're playing a game on your 60hz monitor with VSync enabled, and your graphics card can only generate 55 fps in a particular part. In this example, your monitor will be ready to display a new image slightly faster than your graphics card can generate it. There isn't a huge difference between 55 fps and 60 fps, so really the image could still look pretty smooth. Yet, with VSync enabled, your graphics card needs to wait for the signal from your monitor before generating new frames. Let's say the image in the Primary Buffer is being displayed on the screen. Your graphics card is currently rendering the next image, but again, it is slightly slower than your monitor's refresh rate. Before the graphics card has finished rendering that image, your monitor sends the signal that it's ready for the next completed frame. Since the only completed frame in the Frame Buffer is the one currently displayed, the monitor continues displaying it and restarts its refresh cycle. Even though the next image is ready to be displayed only milliseconds later, the graphics card must wait until the monitor's next refresh/signal before sending the image and rendering the next one. This results in a new frame being displayed at most every other refresh (or every third, fourth, etc depending on how many fps the graphics card is actually capable of rendering at the time). Seeing a new image every other refresh on a 60hz monitor means you're only seeing 30 fps. As a result of VSync being enabled here, you are now getting 30 fps when you could and should be getting 55 fps. 

This is the problem with VSync. Since frame rates have a tendency to jump up and down depending on what's going on in a game, it can be difficult to know when to turn it on and when to turn it off. For instance, you may get a consistent 60+ fps while you're playing in an indoor level, but the second you enter the game's open world area your fps drops to 50.  

One feature that can be used to help deal with this problem is **Triple Buffering**. With VSync enabled, both the Primary and Secondary buffers can often fill and then have to stop working until receiving signal from the monitor that it's ready for a new refresh. Triple Buffering introduces a third buffer to this juggling act, which can help alleviate the drop in fps by giving the graphics card another place to generate an image. So why not always enable Triple Buffering? Well not all games support it, and even if they do, Triple Buffering requires more VRAM to be dedicated to the Frame Buffer. With cards that don't have a lot of spare VRAM or games that require a good amount of it, additional performance issues can result since the card now has to balance its use of VRAM with the added demand of the extra buffer. 

Another great solution is enabling Adaptive VSync. **Adaptive VSync** basically turns VSync on for you when the frame rates are greater than the refresh rate and turns it off when the frame rates drop below the refresh rate. The caveat with this solution is that it's unfortunately limited to Nvidia users only. If you're using an Nvidia card, the option to turn it on can be found in the Nvidia Control Panel. I don't believe AMD has an equivalent feature as of yet. 

So yeah, I hope this helps clear some things up. I'm aware it's probably not 100% accurate, but I think it does a good enough job providing some understanding on how VSync works and when it should or shouldn't be used. With that said, please let me know if any of the explanations are offensively incorrect, or feel free to add anything I may have missed that would be helpful. 

**TL;DR:** Although there are no hard line rules, the closest thing you can have to them would be if your frame rate is generally below your monitor's refresh rate, then it's better to turn VSync off. If your frame rate is generally above the refresh rate, turn it on. 

And cue the comments about my inaccuracies now. 

**EDIT:** Glad to see most people are enjoying this, thanks. Compliments of Alfaa123 and a few others, it seems like I should also mention something about input lag. **Input lag** is the time between when you do something via the mouse or keyboard (or some other input device) and when that input or command is actually shown on the screen. There will always be some amount of input lag, it's just a matter of whether the lag is long enough to be noticeable. As wtallis explains, since VSync requires the graphics card to wait for the signal from the monitor before rendering additional frames, the frames in the buffer can often become stale or old. By the time the graphics card actually renders these frames, it's likely enough time has gone by that there will be visible lag on screen. This is another problem that can be caused by VSync.

I should also note there are some other good points made below and certain things explained better and with more detail than I used, so worth giving a look.

I wrote this about VSync because I feel like there just aren't many, if any, sources that directly address it and explain it. These are all things I've just pieced together from different sources and forums. If there are other things people would like explained like this, throw out suggestions and maybe I or someone with more knowledge could do another one of these. I think it'd be a cool addition to this subreddit.  ",,False,,t5_2rnve,1356052572.0,,,True,t3_1544hx,http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/1544hx/explaining_vsync_and_other_things/,

I told him I wanted to use it for gaming, but I'm 11, and he thought I wanted to play those like, facebook games that are real crappy, but I don't. So, he said I don't need a video card, just the integrated graphics would be fine. I tried to explain to him I'll be playing high-end games, but still said integrated graphics would be good. That's the thing I'm mostly angry about. 
  
  He also told me to change the i7 3820 to a i5 3570k, as he said I wouldn't need it as I won't need to have dual cards. I tried to explain about how I MIGHT be using dual cards in future and I want to use hyper-threading, as me and my sister will do video editing/photo editing. However, me not being fluent in chinese,  just english, could not explain it to him well.
  
  When he said about the i5 3570k, I told him if I went to that CPU I would want to go with the Gigabyte GA-Z77X-UD3H but he said that board wasn't good, even though /r/buildapc says otherwise.
  
  He also said that the CPU cooler I wanted (Cooler Master Hyper 212 EVO) wasn't needed and he showed me his cooler, I tried to ask what cooler was it, but I didn't catch what he said properly.
  
  He also said the use of a SSD is redundant, only startup would be faster and that was useless, I'm not sure if he knows I want to put a few games in it as well.
  
  He said that Windows 8 isn't good, though I wanted to give it a try, but my mother said: ""Yeah I heard a lot of complaints on it too."" and so, he told me to use Windows 7.
  
  He said that the new 700 series is too new and modern sort of thing, and told me instead of buying the 760, get the 670.
  
  So my trip to him wasn't as good as I expected to be. I also wanted to build the PC on my own, but my mother insisted he build it, I know I'm 11 but I have my 14 year old sister to help me out too. He also said that I want all these expensive things because I watch advertisements and yadda yadda yadda. So /r/buildapc, I need your help. How can I convince my mother, most of my choices are better than his and I should build the PC myself? Thanks, -Stonecrates

EDIT: Wow, thanks to everyone who commented, this seems like a pretty busy post! I'll have a talk with my sister, and show her this website. She'll probably support me and maybe, me and my sister could persuade my mother!

EDIT 2: Thanks a lot everybody who commented, I might not be able to reply to all your comments, but I'm really grateful all of you could help. I'm going to sleep now, I'll be checking it out in the afternoon, thanks a lot /r/buildapc!

EDIT 3: Holy cow, this is a lot of support. Anyway, I persuaded my mother, and she now accepts, except that when I'm building the computer, My uncle will guide me. Can anyone suggest good places to buy parts? (Please try to be specific!)

**EDIT** - Just to respond to everyone offering me things: I really appreciate it, but I was sharing this for humor and not so much to solicit charity. Between insurance and help from many different people, we should come out of this just fine. I kind of feel like it would be bad form for me to accept a big pile of free things, so I am not planning on taking advantage of any of your offers. I may reconsider at some point, but only if all parties understand that I am not someone who is in dire NEED of help. This whole incident is mostly a very big, very long term inconvenience to me, not something that has ruined my life or put me in a bad position, financially or otherwise.

To those asking if the system is bricked:  I don't know.  The monitored is clearly trashed. The keyboard had some keys broken off and has some mud/insulation/drywall in it.  The case is mostly fine, but one side panel doesn't shut properly right now because it's a bit bent.  I removed hard drives from all my PCs, including this one, for data security and retrieval if possible.  The inside looked pretty decent all things considered.  My main concern is the power supply that has an intake in the top.  I expect it has a good amount of crud in it.

Ultimately though, I will probably not bother trying to turn it on or salvage other parts. That may be kind of off-putting, but understand that everything I own has been buried in broken bits of house, covered in muddy rain, and then rained on again several times over the past 2 weeks.  Much of it is probably ""salvageable"" given enough time and effort, but were I to try to save absolutely everything possible, I could be sorting through things and cleaning things for several months. The alternative is saving the most important things, like sentimental items that can't be replaced, calling in someone to haul everything else away as trash, and then using insurance money to start from scratch. It seems wasteful, it feels wasteful, but it allows us to sort of finish this whole thing up more quickly and move on.",,False,,t5_2rnve,1370267344.0,,,True,t3_1fiqvx,http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/1fiqvx/build_complete_tornado_edition/,

**Why should I clean my computer?**   

* It will lower your temperatures, saving part of your computer's valuable life   
* It can prevent you from getting diseases. There is so much dust and dirt inside of your computer that cleaning it can stop these harmful allergens and such from entering YOUR body.  
*  You will feel at least 24% better knowing that you have a clean, beautiful computer.    
* **What do I need?**    
*A cleaning tool of some sort.    
*What?*  
 Something like a    
A) An anti-static/computer vacuum 
B) Compressed Air      
C) An electric handheld air compressor such as [this](http://www.amazon.com/Metro-Vacuum-ED500-500-Watt-Electric/dp/B001J4ZOAW/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&amp;amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;amp;qid=1351955906&amp;amp;amp;sr=1-1&amp;amp;amp;keywords=electric+air+compressor) little guy.  
*  **Alright, i have one... What now?** *Hold your horses*   
*  And last but not least, zip ties. Lots of zip ties...    
*  **Now What**  
   
Now, you pick where to start.       



**The Actual Computer**    
Please turn off, turn of the PSU, and unplug all parts of your motherboard to peripherals connections. Now, make sure the floor where you plan on doing open computer surgery is clean. Then, place newspapers over where you will place your computer. This will help prevent static and some more dust from entering while cleaning as well as taking away all disadvantages of carpet.  Now, place your computer, open, on the newspapers/floor. Now, get your [Cleaning Duhicky ](http://i.imgur.com/53huU.jpg) ready. I used some sort of woman's sock attached to a shop vac on blower mode. Once your make at home computer cleaner is ready, look for loose hair/fur/dust first. It is easiest to spot, and vac that up or push it out or whatever you chose to do. Once those little guys are up, start with the power supply. Get everything possibly on or around it. Make sure its fans and openings are especially clear. You will need to get with your hands what is not picked up by the vac. It should be just a couple of dog/cat hairs/pollens, etc. Once you've got your power supply done, give yourself a little pat on the back. Now, we are going to the CPU cooler. Remove the fan from the heatsink, but do not remove the heat sink from the CPU. I am using a cooler master 212 EVO, so thats what i will demonstrate with. Stock Intel/AMD coolers and water coolers, there isnt really much for you to do here. Just make sure you are clear of everything. Anyways, hers what i mean for anyone who has a heatsink/fan combo. http://i.imgur.com/x9bey.jpg Give that sucker a quick run through. Now, you should have a bear [heatsink](http://i.imgur.com/iltFv.jpg) crying over the loss of its only friend. Take a moment, and clean it using your tool.  These little guys are in such awkward positions that you WILL NOT BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE PERFECTION. But what you end up with better be a lot better than what you started with. Now, put your fan back onto the heatsink using the clamps on the sides of the fan. Now that the star-crossed lovers are [re-united,](http://i.imgur.com/ZQGuU.jpg) head over to the video card, and just clean whatever you can. Don't worry if you don't get much, there should be a little bit of dust on the back and little to none on the front.  Take a quick look through again, and make sure there is no more dust just laying around. Now, we manage cables. This is probably **THE MOST IMPORTANT** thing we will do today, and it will help your computer more than you can believe. I undid my zip-tie management for this, but if you have great cable managemnet already, you can skil this.  
**Cable management:** Take all the zip-ties you have lying around and gather them together to form your [zip-tie](http://i.imgur.com/VwFR2.jpg) army. Now, go to work. Zip tie EVERY place you see more than one wire going to the same place, then cut the zip ties leashes. This is how I was doing it. It's not fantastic, but it's a hell of a lot better.  [album](http://imgur.com/uEsD5,XZXLn,SM4Yq,WfOdY,YiMVV) If there are any large cables that have room in the back of the case, or extras, try to get them uncluttered and run them through the back. Hopefully, it should be as simple as it was for [me.](http://imgur.com/LsFJG,8X2qv)

**After Cable Management:**   
Now that that is over with, go ahead and take another run through with your device, letting it get rid of even the things you can not see. Now, take the last panel of your case, and get it fairly well with your tool. Then, pat yourself on the back, and put it back on. A job well done on the inside of your case.   
**PLEASE NOTE** If you get any part of your computer wet, a little dampness is fine, just do not turn it back on until you are 100% sure it has evaporated.       
**Outside of the case**:
All you need are electronic wipes (available... just about everywhere) and paper towels. Real quickly [swab](http://i.imgur.com/2xyZ7.jpg) down the case with an electronic wipe, then do the same with a dry paper towel. Before putting the computer into its old place, do a quick go-through of where you are putting it to make sure nothing is where it should be sitting that will dust it even more.   
**After**  
There are a few ways to prevent yourself from having to do this in the near future. (A) dust filters. they are self explanatory and do their job quite well. Newegg link [here](http://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.aspx?Submit=ENE&amp;amp;amp;N=-1&amp;amp;amp;IsNodeId=1&amp;amp;amp;Description=Dust%20Filters&amp;amp;amp;bop=And&amp;amp;amp;Order=RATING&amp;amp;amp;PageSize=20) to clean them, just run compressed air or somesuch through them or wash them (make sure they are dry before re applying) and (B) Air purifiers. Those two are all i can think of off the top of my head. I will gladly edit in more ways if anyone mentions them.    
Now, the ***Keyboard***   
To clean your keyboard, there isnt much you need to do.  Just be a dentist and get up in your keyboards cavities looking for issues. http://imgur.com/kuxmP,CvstL  Then, go over it with an electronic wipe, and you should be good. If seomething is stuck in a key or under a key, all you need to do is remove that key. To do this, use some for of leverage such as a spoon back, or part of [one of these amazing kits](http://www.ifixit.com/Tools/Home-Tech-Toolkit/IF145-047) work well. If you decide to wash your keyboard, you can run it thrgouh the dishwasher without soap or just run water through it. Don't use isaprophal unless you are willing to get marks like [these](http://i.imgur.com/Gwcwg.jpg) that i haven't been able to get off for *months*   
***Monitor:***      
Monitors are by far the easist part of your computer to clean. All you have to do is shine a light towards them to illuminate dirt, and wipe in a circular motion. If there are any wet spots, or stains, just keep rubbing the wipe on them. If that doesnt do it, some *Next To Godliness* spray will. Do not use paper towels here, as paper towels will scratch your screen.  http://i.imgur.com/Zyed1.jpg     
Thanks for reading,  
Ben. If there are any questions/comments/conserns, i am more than willing to answer them, just let me know. If there is anthing else you would like covered, shoot me a comment, and ill edit it in. Thanks, and happy cleaning!

CPU: I chose this because I have the same CPU in most of my other builds, also for it's good performance and overclocking ability in case I ever need to squeeze a bit more performance out of it in the future. Looking back, a i5-3470 probably would have sufficed but I chose the parts pretty quickly

Motherboard: Seems to be one of the best Mini-ITX motherboards, I like Gigabyte's motherboards, along with the fact that it has built-in wifi and Bluetooth which is pretty much necessary in a business environment and my choice was made.

RAM: Came free with a build that I made a while ago and I never used it, I already owned it and it's good RAM, so I went with it.

Storage: One of the things that my father wanted was an SSD and also a good HDD. The Caviar Blacks are great and the 840 Pros are fast.

Case: Do I need to explain?

1366122681.0,646,self.buildapc,1cgndm,Everything you need to know about Haswell (so far). Info and FAQs.,762,116,271,http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/1cgndm/everything_you_need_to_know_about_haswell_so_far/,"Socket and Chipset Changes:

- **Socket 1150**  
Haswell will be on the socket 1150 platform, meaning you won't be able to drop one of these chips in your current motherboard.

- **USB 3.0**  
Haswell's USB controller is supposed to be able to achieve the maximum 10Gb/s that USB 3.0 promised. So far, we've only been able to achieve 5Gb/s on current platforms.

- **PCIe Lanes**  
Haswell will not be able to run 16x/16x on PCIe 3.0. This was obvious, because the amount of pins on the socket made it physically impossible to support that many PCIe lanes. If you're using multiple high-end graphics cards, you're still better off with 2011. 

- **Memory**  
Haswell will continue to support dual-channel DDR3 memory. The first time we're expected to see DDR4 on desktop machines will be with Haswell-E. Haswell will natively support overclocked RAM speeds of up to 3200MHz. Why you'd need that kind of speed, I have no goddamn clue. 

Architecture Changes:

- **On-die VRM**:   
One of the biggest and most significant changes to Haswell architecture from Ivy Bridge is moving the voltage regulation module (VRM) on to the chip itself.  
What does this mean to you? Well, we can only speculate at this point, but you're likely going to see more aggressive overclocking due to the fact that the VRM will be cooled by the CPU's heatsink instead of those smaller ones you see on most high end motherboards. You're also going to be a little safer overclocking, because you won't be at the mercy of shitty manufacturers putting low quality VRMs on your board.

- **Integrated Graphics**  
There are four new levels of integrated graphics available on various Haswell chips. GT1, GT2, GT3, and GT3e. GT1-3 are ranked in ascending order of power, with the GT3 rumored to be as powerful as an nVidia GT 650M.

- **eDram**  
eDram is basically a fourth level of cache above L3. Intel claims that it is large enough and fast enough to hold a frame buffer.  This will be available only on the GT3e platform
This means you should be getting far better performance while running on integrated graphics. How it will stack up to AMD's A-series is still up in the air, but I don't expect the i series to be able to topple the mighty APU.

- **Unlocked Core Multiplier**  
Your maximum core multiplier has been raised from 56 to 80.  
Unless you're cooling with ln2 (liquid nitrogen), this means nothing to you. What we can expect to see is Intel actually having a chance to surpass AMD's current overclocking record.

- **Unlocked CPU Strap and Higher BCLK tolerance**  
This will allow for higher overclocks for those that like to tweak beyond the core multiplier. Ivy Bridge and Sandy Bridge were very picky about leaving the BLCK alone, and would cause random failures and errors if adjusted. Some early testers have reported stability up to 117MHz!

- **Turbo Mode**  
Turbo mode has changed slightly. The only difference is that switching it off put you permanently at maximum turbo frequency.

- **Idling**  
Previously, Intel CPUs would idle down to 1600MHz. Now they'll go as low as 800MHz, meaning you'll see a lot less power consumption on machines that aren't running 24/7.


FAQ

- **I'm a first time builder, should I get Ivy Bridge or wait until Haswell?**
That's a tough one that depends on a lot of factors. Here are a few reasons why you'd want to wait for Haswell:  
- If you are an overclocker or want to try overclocking.  
- If you are building a system that will run on integrated graphics.  
- If you need to transfer large amount of data with USB 3.0 on a regular basis.  
If you don't fall into any of these categories, then you could safely pick up an Ivy Bridge chip. If you're patient, there is no harm in waiting for Haswell.

- **Will there be a large performance difference for gamers between Haswell and Ivy Bridge?**  
Likely, no more than any Intel ""tock"". You'll see a 10-15% increase and a few new neat features.

- **What's coming after Haswell?**  
The next series of processors is going to be called Broadwell, and is on Intel's ""tick"" of their development cycle. You'll see a small increase in performance, very similar features, and an increase in power efficiency.

- **What about the BGA rumors?**  
Intel briefly floated the idea of switching from LGA (land grid array) to BGA (ball grid array), meaning the chips would have to be soldered onto the sockets. This was met with outrage from the building and enthusiast community, so they dropped the idea fairly quickly. To reiterate, Haswell's socket is LGA 1150.   
Broadwell is rumored to be on BGA, with intel having all their future ""ticks"" be BGA and ""tocks"" being LGA. Anyone who has access to this information is under a NDA, so don't expect reliable information any time in the near future.

- **When can I get my hands on one?**  
The official launch date is June 2nd, 2013. However, there was a small issue with the USB 3.0 controller that causes transfers to halt that requires the computer to be rebooted. Until this is ironed out, Haswell's availability will be highly restricted. If you desperately want one on or near launch day, you may have to line up.

- **Will Ivy/Sandy Bridge prices drop dramatically with the launch of Haswell?**  
No. You won't ever see deep discounts in processors until they're far beyond obsolete. There is absolutely no reason Intel would give you a reason to buy an older chip.",,False,,t5_2rnve,1366136705.0,,,True,t3_1cgndm,http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/1cgndm/everything_you_need_to_know_about_haswell_so_far/,

While building a pc is amazingly rewarding and fun, it may not be right for everyone. I thought I'd type this up in hopes of outlining the benefits and not-so-much-benefits of building your own pc in hopes of helping those who are new to community decide on whether or not it is right for them. For vets of /r/buildapc, I'd love feedback on what to add and change. 


**Financial considerations when building a PC**

Building a PC is a cost effective way of obtaining a computer. By building your own computer you'll generally be able to have a much faster computer per dollar spent than if you were to buy one off the shelf in a store. The only situation where this may not be true is for extremely low budgets (&lt;$250 not including monitor, mouse, keyboard) where buying used/discount computer may be a better option. This is especially true if you need to buy windows, as it is often included with such computers but needs to be obtained separately if you're building your own. Of course piracy/linux are sometimes used to avoid this cost but whether or not they're appropriate depends on your needs and personal preferences. If you're dead set on building a computer on a low budget, [there are some great examples of such builds on r/buildapc](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/wlv7v/build_complete_aggressively_lowbudget_htpc_100/). 

For the rest of those interested in building their own pc, the monetary savings are one of the biggest benefits to building your own computer. This is doubly true if you're interested in gaming. The [Alienware X51](http://configure.us.dell.com/dellstore/config.aspx?oc=dpcwxn1&amp;model_id=alienware-x51&amp;c=us&amp;l=en&amp;s=dhs&amp;cs=19) is currently $700. Building your own [slightly better computer](http://pcpartpicker.com/p/hRrJ)  (I actually had to use a better graphics card because I couldn't find the stuff they stuck in there) would save you a whopping $220 dollars. That's like getting it for 31% off. Please don't use the computer build I just posted, a lot of the components are crap but you can be sure dell will use the cheapest PSU, cd drive, HD, etc... If you want a gaming or high end computer, building a computer is by far the most cost-effective method of obtaining it. For additional savings, check out /r/buildapcsales and sign up for newegg and similar retailers promotions. 


**The hidden cost:Time**

I hesitated to call this a cost, because for me and probably 99% for the folks on this board, choosing parts and building a computer is leisure not work. However, be aware that it will take more time to choose parts and assemble your computer than it will if you simply order a prebuilt one online. If you don't have time to pick up a new hobby and have, building a computer might not be the wisest choice. You can cut down time in choosing parts by buying a kit from newegg or (preferred) visiting /r/buildapcforme where they will actually pick out parts and give you a link that you can order them all from. Once your stuff arrives it shouldn't take you more than saturday (maybe the sunday too) to put watch instructional videos and put it together. Check the sidebar for great information about how to actually assemble your computer.


**Computer troubleshooting/maintenance** 

One of the most time-consuming and often frustrating aspects of building a computer can be troubleshooting and maintenance. If you buy an off the shelf PC you can typically send it in and get it replaced (provided it is in warranty still). If you built your own, you wind up having to play detective and identify what has gone wrong and how to fix it. /r/techsupport and the manufacturers of your components can be of great help, but it is going to be ultimately up to you to fix problems. If this is not something you feel up to doing, building a pc might not be right for you. However, you will learn valuable computer trouble shooting skills. When parts break after their warranty, you don't have to replace the entire computer (as you might with a destktop) or pay some schmuck to replace a part for you. In fact, you might even be able to make some money by being that schmuck for your friends. 

The time investment in troubleshooting is one of the main reasons why many of us will caution you against building a computer for someone you know. You will get a phone call every time they accidentally install a virus, spill water on it, or when it stops running because the fans are clogged with dust and cat-hair. If it's a significant other or a close family member this might not be terrible but for acquaintances or those not living near you this can be a nightmare. People get upset when their computer breaks and they will inevitably blame you. 


**Can I build a computer?**

Do you have functioning hands or can you turn a screwdriver with your feet? If you answered yes you can build a computer. It might seem daunting and complicated but there aren't really that many parts and they go together in a fairly simple manner. There are thousands of videos and articles that can help you through it and a great community here at /r/buildapc and over at /r/techsupport. Building a computer is something everyone of every age can do, provided they're willing to spend a little bit of time learning. You don't have to be particularly skilled with your hands, or even all that smart to put together a computer. I would estimate the difficulty to be far less than that of putting together ikea furniture (because screw that, amirite?) and slightly above that of a $10 lego set. If you're particularly worried, find a friend who builds computers and have them come over. We love building computers so much that you practically have to force us not to come over and help. 


**Other benefits to building a PC**

You'll get to have the PC you want, customize to look and perform the way you want it. You get to have an immense sense of satisfaction every time you turn on your computer. The parts in your computer will be better quality and longer lasting than the stuff the big manufacturers use. You can install just the drivers and not have to deal with bloatware (ugh). Having computer hardware knowledge is a plus in almost every field, so it will be an amazing job skill to have. Your computer will staty current longer and can be upgraded a bit as you go meaning you'll need to buy a new computer much less frequently. People won't laugh at you for owning a pre-built Alienware (and yes, they will laugh). You'll have a few hundred dollar bills to light your cigars, and most of all you'll have picked up a new hobby that will likely stimulate you intellectually. While this is far from complete, there are many more advantages to building your own pc which hopefully will show up in the comments. 



**Should I buy parts incrementally or save up then buy all at once?(Suggested by ElPanda)**

Generally, your best bet is to buy things all at once. There is no point in buying a video card and waiting six months to install it. By the time you install it it will be worth less than what you paid for it and you could have bought a better card. Also, if there is an issue you're out of the 30 day return policy and you'll have to rely on manufacturer warranties. There are exceptions to this rule. If you find a case on a good sale, you can buy that ahead of time. Cases that are broken are generally broken in obvious ways and don't require installation of components to test. Good cases last several builds and are *less* time sensitive than CPUs, motherboards, and GPUs. With the exception of small changes, case designs don't change much over time. The same goes for case fans (but not CPU fans/heatsinks), as well as CD/DVD drives (but not as much blu-ray drives). All of these items hold their price and don't change much in format. PSUs don't change much but shouldn't be bought in advance because they have a higher failure rate and cost more than fans and DVD drives. Even the exceptional items can be picked up when sales happen, but shouldn't be bought for a build planned more ~3 months in the future. If you have a way to test a monitor (e.g. another computer, laptop with VGA output), it might be good to buy it a couple weeks before your build so you can make sure it doesn't need to be returned. It sucks to have a set up computer and wait for your monitor to be RMA'd. 

That being said, it really is best to just save your money until the very last minute. You can look at your budget and what types of technology are out there and what the market is like and decide where your money is best spent. When in doubt, wait. 

**How much do I need?**

How much of a computer do you want? Do you want to play games or just surf the web?  $300-500 will build you a computer that can play older games just fine and most newer games on medium-low settings. $500 - 800 will build you a decent gaming rig that will play most games on medium-high settings and stay current for a while. Around $1000 and more you start to get into heftier computers that will be able to handle high/ultra settings in new games for a while on a single monitor. Somewhere just over that hump $1400 is where you see a lot of cookie cutter, high powered builds. These computers will get you several years of solid gaming. It's my personal opinion that this is where you'll see a whole lot of bang for your buck. Above this you start to get into hardcore builds that I'm too poor to even comment on. If you're interested in really high end systems, it's advised you do a lot more reading than this guide before you purchase. 


**What about warranties and RMA's and rebates and all that confusing stuff? (Suggested in part by SirBonobo)**

Warranties on parts from good manufacturers are often awesome. Simply put, the community doesn't tolerate bad companies, and bad companies starve. They don't cover spills or customer's fault damage but they do cover parts that die randomly. Some companies even have programs where they'll send you the new part the same day you send in the broken one. RMA's mean return merchant authorization, which is a fancy way for saying return. I've only ever dealt with Newegg and Amazon but they've all taken my returns, often paying for shipping and at most charging a modest restocking fee. Rebates are a devils bargain. Be aware that turning in a rebate makes it to where you can't RMA stuff (but you can still use the warranty through the manufacturer). It's best to fill out the rebates as close to the deadline as possible in case the stuff breaks within the RMA period. 


**I have an old PC, can I salvage parts (tuheas)**
If cost is a heavy consideration, an old PC might help you make you save some money or get up and running before you have money for all the parts. Depending on the Age of the PC, the number one thing to salvage is the windows licence. Even if its XP or vista, you can use that license to buy an upgrade copy of windows 7 which is cheaper. Other than that, DVD rom drives can be salvaged if they're SATA. Sometimes the PSU, HD and Case can be salvaged. When in doubt, ask the folks here. 

**I've decided to build a computer, where do I go from here?**

Read [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/f3efg) from the sidebar. Then read the rest of the sidebar, look for builds that were made in your price range on here or [pcpartpicker](http://www.pcpartpicker.com). Make a build on a pcpartpicker.com and post it here for feedback.

**I've decided not to build a computer, any advice?**

Lots of websites out there will sell you a computer. I'd personally go to [newegg](http://www.newegg.com) first. They have pretty good deals on complete computers from a bunch of manufacturers, then places like [cyberpowerpc](http://www.cyberpowerpc.com). These places give you more options to customize your build. You're probably still gonna want to learn a little about hardware so you get the computing power you need. 

**tl;dr** Build a PC if you have more than $300 for your budget, want/need to save money, have time to spend building and troubleshooting, and want to learn a new life skill. Buy a used/discounted computer if you're on an extremely small budget. If you have a lot of money and no time, it might be best to buy a premade computer. Use standoffs. 

**edit:** Thanks for all the great feedback, I'll work on adding some of the top comments. If I forget to include your name next to your idea, yell at me (via a message) and I'll make sure to give you credit. 

**edit 2** Taking a break for a bit to play some games. I'll answer questions and add stuff to this post later. 

**edit 3** At the request of several PMs and a comment or two I wrote up a guide about how to save money when building your own computer. A lot of folks felt swamped in high end builds and wanted to know how they could build on budgets. It's located [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/104ye3/how_to_save_money_when_you_buildapc/). I think this is all the guide writing I have in me for a while. 
",,False,,t5_2rnve,1348066036.0,,,True,t3_103n5n,http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/103n5n/should_you_buildapc/,
1299096378.0,606,self.buildapc,fw0gw,You built a computer.  Now what?,710,104,111,http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/fw0gw/you_built_a_computer_now_what/,"How to stability test a new PC, how to test components, and what software to install once your computer is up and running seem to be pretty common questions in here. As such, I figured it would be good to have a post consolidating all the different recommendations people have for software and what they do.  Feel free to add stuff I forgot or to correct me if I’m wrong about something.  I’d like us to have something that could be updated that we can point people to whenever they come in asking about software other than just pointing to [Ninite]( http://ninite.com/).  That said, Ninite is still a great place to start for software.

**Overclocking/Stability**

Once you put your computer together, one of the first things you should do is check to make sure your RAM is good.  The two main ways to do this are by using Window’s built in [Memory Diagnostic Tool]( http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/715-memory-diagnostics-tool.html) and by using [MemTest86+](http://www.memtest.org/).  Both test your RAM and let you know if you have any bad sectors.  

If you’re not overclocking your CPU, ignore this paragraph and the next.  If you have an AMD CPU, [AMD OverDrive](http://sites.amd.com/us/game/downloads/amd-overdrive/Pages/overview.aspx) is a great tool for identifying a good starting BIOS overclock.  In addition to letting you overclock within the OS and having overclocking profiles, it has stress testing software built in.

Once you have your CPU overclocked in your BIOS or UEFI, you’ll want to test your system stability.  [LinX]( http://www.xtremesystems.org/forums/showthread.php?t=201670), [OCCT]( http://www.ocbase.com/perestroika_en/index.php?Download), and [Prime95]( http://files.extremeoverclocking.com/file.php?f=205) are generally considered the best stress testing suites out there.  All three will test your RAM and CPU or just your CPU.  Generally a system is not considered stable until it can run a stress test suite for several hours without crashing.  [IntelBurnTest]( http://www.xtremesystems.org/forums/showthread.php?t=197835) is another popular stress testing program.  It’s important to check your temps every 5-15 minutes for the first hour or so of stress testing to make sure that your temps aren’t getting too high as too much heat can damage and shorten the life of your components.  Your system should shut itself down if temps go too high, but keeping your eye on it at the start also will let you know if you haven't mounted your heatsink correctly.

GPU overclocking has also become quite the norm.  Most GPUs should come with software to let you overclock, but not all do.  Even if it does come with overclocking software, sometimes it’s worth checking out other suites to see if you can get a better overclock out of them.  For Nvidia, I’d start with [MSI Afterburner]( http://event.msi.com/vga/afterburner/download.htm), [EVGA Precision]( http://www.evga.com/precision/), [EVGA OC Scanner](http://www.evga.com/articles/00530/ ), [EVGA ELEET](http://www.evga.com/eleet/), and [Asus GPU Tweak](http://event.asus.com/vga/2012/gpu_tweak/).  For AMD, check out [MSI Afterburner]( http://event.msi.com/vga/afterburner/download.htm), [Asus GPU Tweak]( http://event.asus.com/vga/2012/gpu_tweak/), [Sapphire Trixx](https://www.sapphireselectclub.com/ssc/TriXX/TriXX.aspx), or Catalyst Control Center.  Most of those tools have basic testing, but to really see if your GPU overclock is stable, you should run [OCCT](http://www.ocbase.com/perestroika_en/index.php?Download), Cinebench, and try out different game benchmarks, such as the [S.T.A.L.K.E.R. benchmark]( http://downloads.guru3d.com/S.T.A.L.K.E.R-Call-of-Pripyat-benchmark-download-2433.html).  Furmark, while great, has been throttled on some newer cards like AMD’s 6000 series of GPUs.

For checking your HDD health and benches, take a look at [HD Tune](http://www.hdtune.com/download.html).  It looks like CrystalDiskInfo grew some adware.  Let me know if CrystalDiskMark did as well so I can remove it.

Lastly, for optimizing your SSD, check out the [SSD Tweak Utility]( http://www.techspot.com/downloads/4926-ssd-tweaker.html) and [Sean's Windows 7 SSD Optimization Guide](http://www.overclock.net/t/1156654/seans-windows-7-install-optimization-guide-for-ssds-hdds).

**Benchmarks**

Once you get your computer setup, one of the first things some people like to do is run benches.  I won’t toss too many out, but there are a few (outside of gaming benches) that are considered to be pretty standard benches.  If you want to bench your computer, check out [3DMark 11]( http://www.3dmark.com/3dmark11/download/)^4, [PCMark Vantage]( http://www.futuremark.com/benchmarks/pcmarkvantage/download/)^4, [3DMark 06]( http://www.futuremark.com/benchmarks/3dmark06/download/)^4, [Cinebench]( http://www.maxon.net/products/cinebench/overview.html),  [Unigine Heaven]( http://unigine.com/download/), [HD Tune]( http://www.hdtune.com/)^4,  [IOMeter](http://www.iometer.org/doc/downloads.html), [ATTO](http://majorgeeks.com/ATTO_Disk_Benchmark_d6359.html), and [CrystalDiskMark]( http://crystalmark.info/software/CrystalDiskMark/index-e.html).  I tend to gravitate toward CineBench and game benchmarks ([Guru3D](http://downloads.guru3d.com/Benchmarks-&amp;-Demo's_c6.html) also hosts a bunch) since the others are synthetic benchmarks that aren’t representative of real world performance.  OCN also has a brief [thread on recommended benches](http://www.overclock.net/t/826902/benchmarking-essentials).

**System Tweaking**

If you’re like me, there are a lot of little things that you want to tweak in the OS. [Ultimate Windows Tweaker]( http://www.thewindowsclub.com/ultimate-windows-tweaker-v2-a-tweak-ui-for-windows-7-vista) is a great place to start and gives you immediate access to a lot of Windows fine tuning.

**System Info/Monitoring**

[HWMonitor]( http://www.cpuid.com/softwares/hwmonitor.html), [PC-Wizard]( http://www.cpuid.com/softwares/pc-wizard.html), [CPU-Z]( http://www.cpuid.com/softwares/cpu-z.html), [GPU-Z]( http://www.techpowerup.com/gpuz/), [GKRellM](http://srcbox.net/projects/gkrellm/), and [HWiNFO64](http://www.hwinfo.com/download64.html) all tell you about your system specs, components, temperatures, etc.  Of that software, HWiNFO64 is my favorite.

To monitor your system temps, I recommend [Real Temp]( http://www.techpowerup.com/realtemp/),  [Core Temp]( http://www.alcpu.com/CoreTemp/), or [SpeedFan]( http://www.almico.com/speedfan.php).  Keep in mind that you have to calibrate SpeedFan (see [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/fw0gw/you_built_a_computer_now_what/c1j21q6) for more info).

**Security**

There are many different perspectivs on system security.  Personally, I run [Microsoft Security Essentials]( http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials/)^1 and [MalwareBytes Anti-Malware]( http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php)^1 and that’s it.  Some people prefer [AVG]( http://free.avg.com/us-en/download-avg-anti-virus-free)^1, [Panda Cloud]( http://www.cloudantivirus.com/en/), or [Avast]( http://www.avast.com/free-antivirus-download)^1.

Other useful security tools are [Keepass]( http://keepass.info/)^1 to securely manage your passwords, [TrueCrypt]( http://www.truecrypt.org/downloads)^1 for HDD encryption, and [Prey]( http://preyproject.com/) for tracking your computer if it gets stolen.

**Desktop Modification**

While Windows 7 looks nice, I like to have the option to modify the desktop's look, feel, and interface.  [Rainmeter]( http://rainmeter.net/RainCMS/) and [Samurize]( http://www.samurize.com/modules/news/) are great places to start for heavily modifying the look and feel of your desktop. 

If you want a calendar on your desktop, [Rainlendar]( http://www.rainlendar.net/cms/index.php) is great.  

Since the Windows key became useful in Vista, I don’t really feel the need for a dock or software like it, but if you want a dock or launch pad, check out [Rocketdock]( http://rocketdock.com/), [ObjectDock]( http://www.stardock.com/products/objectdock/)^4, or [Launchy]( http://www.launchy.net/)^1.

[F.lux](http://stereopsis.com/flux/) changes your monitor's color temperature and brightness based on the time of day and the kind of lighting present.

**Maintenance**

In order to keep your computer running nicely, maintenance is necessary from time to time.  If you need to uninstall something, check out [Revo Uninstaller]( http://www.revouninstaller.com/revo_uninstaller_free_download.html)^1.  It will remove all traces of the software, including all registry entries.  If you’re swapping out your GPU, use [Driver Sweeper]( http://phyxion.net/item/driver-sweeper.html) to get rid of all traces of your last GPU driver first.  [CCleaner]( http://www.piriform.com/)^1 is a great tool for getting rid of temp files, though it’s registry management tools are a bit more controversial.  [Franckey's System Cleanup](http://www.xs4all.nl/~franckey/franckey/software/systemcleanup.htm) is lightweight and will clean unnecessary files much like CCleaner does.  If you don’t like using Window’s built in disk defragger, [Defraggler]( http://www.piriform.com/defraggler)^1 is a great alternative.  Lastly, [Recuva]( http://www.piriform.com/recuva) is a decent place to start if you accidentally delete something.  It’s not so great if you accidentally format the wrong HDD though…

[Secunia PSI](http://secunia.com/vulnerability_scanning/personal/) and [FileHippo Update Checker](http://www.filehippo.com/updatechecker/) are great tools to make sure that your software is up to date and secure.  If the update breaks functionality or it adds adware or something else undesired, check out [FileHippo](http://www.filehippo.com/) first since they maintain old versions, then check out [Oldware](http://www.oldware.org/), [OldVersion](http://www.oldversion.com/), or [VersionDownload](http://www.versiondownload.com/) if you can't find it.

Haven't seen any talk about this on here or on /r/buildapcforme so I thought I would mention it. If your school or university is partnered with Dreamspark then you may be able to get W8 for free. Go to the link above and find your school and see. I was able to get it for free.

One thing to note is that this is actually a Windows 8 Pro UPGRADE KEY, not the full retail/OEM version, at least, that is how it was for me. HOWEVER, if you are wanting to use this for a clean install onto a blank HDD, that is possible. You can follow the guides in the two links below. Enjoy!

Mine would have to be when I was about 13 or 14, I was taking apart the old family PC. I intended to salvage the PSU and CPU and since I knew the fan on the PSU was a bit loose I was going to pull the cover off to take a look to see if it was a easy fix. Well I accidentally touched the all metal screwdriver I was using on something I shouldn't have and shocked the living hell out of my self, balls to the wall body shake. I remember tasting metal in my mouth and having a twitch in my arm for the next few hours. Pretty stupid now that I think about it.

I find it to be a waste of money - even for gaming, the stock coolers provided by Intel are more than sufficient cooling, they are not very loud, and negate the worry of space for install within the case.  Plus, they are free!

The money spent on an aftermarket cooler I feel could be placed towards more important build components, like the GPU or even the power supply.  I'm strictly talking about the ""gaming and homework and stuff"" type builds here - not the one-off builds that obviously need the increased cooling for thinks like overclocking and processor intensive tasks.

There was quite a lot of case cutting involved to get the Titan inside where only a 10"" card was supposed to fit, and the eagle eyed amongst you may notice that there's no hdd inside, but with a bit of cable management I hope to fit that in soon.

Just wanted to let you know of a new facet to PCPartPicker I have just pushed live:  [Price Trends](http://pcpartpicker.com/trends/).

Price trend graphs are generated daily, and show a year's worth of historical price information for several categories of computer hardware.  Thousands of components are grouped into logical categories and combined with price data.  The data is analyzed and presented as an intensity graph of price distributions with minimum, maximum, and average price trends.

Right now I'm generating graphs for the following categories:

* [CPUs](http://pcpartpicker.com/trends/cpu/) (broken out by popular models/sockets/families)
* [HDDs/SSDs](http://pcpartpicker.com/trends/internal-hard-drive/)
* [Memory](http://pcpartpicker.com/trends/memory/)
* [Monitors](http://pcpartpicker.com/trends/monitor/) (broken out by size and whether or not it is IPS)
* [Video Cards](http://pcpartpicker.com/trends/video-card/) (broken out by chipsets - Radeon HD 7*** and GeForce GT(X|S) 6**

Want to check whether overall RAM prices are rising or falling (hint: still rising), or if a CPU will drop in price with the arrival a new architecture (hint: nope)?  No problem.  You can also use these graphs to see what is happening price-wise to different GPU chipsets when new chipsets are introduced, such as the recently released GeForce GTX 650 Ti Boost.

The goal of these graphs is to enable you to make more informed buying decisions by showing computer hardware price patterns.  That way if you're wondering whether to buy now, or whether it's safe to wait... now it won't have to be guesswork.  My plan is pretty simple - try and provide as much information as possible to help you get the best bang for your buck hardware-wise.  (That's also why I added the [parametric price alerts](http://pcpartpicker.com/blog/parametric-price-alerts), which I think have worked really well so far and are worth plugging again.)

And as a fun side-note, if you look close at some of the graphs, you can see some interesting artifacts in the data:

* [Holiday sales](http://i.imgur.com/UjXzmWU.png) are easy to spot.  Makes it easy to recognize if a given component class goes on sale frequently, seasonally, or not at all.
* [Here](http://i.imgur.com/plwnB5a.png) and [here](http://i.imgur.com/zL3odrG.png) look like a retailer doing some price optimization (trying to find the best margin/volume tradeoff, I presume?) - I've seen Amazon do this stair step price reduction before - might even be able to auto-detect the pattern some day.
* [Here](http://i.imgur.com/E13DW0i.png) is a retailer price error.  Sometimes you'll see spikes in the opposite direction, which are often ridiculously inflated prices to reduce demand during stock shortages.

And on an unrelated side-note, I've finished up a few weeks worth of server tweaks and upgrades.  The end result should be a bit snappier site performance-wise - the upgrades/changes should shave anywhere from a few hundred milliseconds to a second off of page rendering times.

Cheers,

PCPartPicker / Philip

[Worklog found here:](http://forums.bit-tech.net/showthread.php?t=256000)

Some of you may recognise this rig as I've shown it a couple of times in various states of completion.  Only now, though, can I say it's actually done.  I still have a lot of work to do on the battlestation front, however, so I won't be posting there until probably October or so.

I started the process back in January, with many of the parts being reused from my build the year before.  Since then I've added parts, removed others, modded **a lot** of bits etc.  until today, where I can finally call this thing complete.

**Important notes on parts:**

* The AX1200 is from my old setup where I had QuadSLI 590s.  My PSU choices were also very limited at the time, this unit has carried my parts very well over the last couple of years.

* I do a lot of CUDA rendering, which is why I went for Titans.  I had also purchased them before the announcement of the 780 (not that my choice would have been different though).  The 6GB of VRAM is simply beautiful and being able to watercool them has been great.

* The Agility 3 is also from my old setup, not sure how long it'll last, but it's not failed me yet!

* I went with dual loops because... well I wanted to, simple as that.  I liked the idea of a challenge, and to be honest, I definitely think it was worth it for the dual coolant look

* The straight tubing is made from acrylic, I used Bitspower C47 fittings to attach everything together.  To make the bends I carefully heated the tubing with a thick power cord on the inside.  Then I simply bent the tubes once they were soft enough.  I love the clean aesthetic that it adds to the build, never been a fan of lots of bendy tubing.

* I'm still very much working on updating my displays etc.  Sadly I couldn't afford to pop for another 2560x1440 monitor so stuck with one of my old 1080p ones.  

* As for keyboards, a similar story where I've made a sacrifice.  I don't do that much typing on my keyboard as many and I don't play that many button-mashy games (teeniest bit of SC2 but the rest are mostly FPS).  I am aware how much better a fully mechanical keyboard is and plan to invest in one as part of my next upgrade.  For now I'm happy with the one I have, but a switch would be nice.

* The mouse I've had for several years now.  I got to try one out in the shop and really liked both the grid button layout (very handy for application shortcuts) and the ability to change the grip style.  I have very large hands, so being able to increase the size of the palm rest was ideal.  Plus I was simply less knowledgeable at the time, there were also fewer similar models out there I believe. 

* I will be heavily overclocking the heck out of these parts too.  Prior to switching GPUs I had my CPU running at 4.7GHz without issues at 1.38V.  I'll try to see if I can reduce that further this time around, I will post the benchmarks when done.  GPUs should be fun to do, couldn't really do much to the 590s, the Titans should be much more resilient.

**[Finished Pictures!](http://imgur.com/a/ncDPj)**

**Mods Involved**

* Removed the 5.25"" bays and made a platform and backing sheet.  Placed the reservoirs there instead.

* Cut out the front fan mount to make room for the tubing

* Top 360mm rad space expanded

* Sleeved all the case, fan, PSU and SATA data cables heatshrinkless

* Main tubing from bent acrylic

* White acrylic PSU shroud and Midplate

* Added 2.5"" mounts to the middle HDD cage

* Various bulkhead and fillport cutouts

* Coated the whole mobo tray in white 3M DiNoc Carbon fibre Vinyl

* Removed and painted the red RAM heatsinks

I built a new gaming PC after I got a sweet deal on a used graphics card and PSU. The graphics card in question is an MSI Twin Frozr III R6950.

I get everything together and start gaming. I'm pretty new to gaming PCs, so I didn't really know much about proper temperature ranges for this kind of hardware. I noticed that my graphics card was running in the mid-90s during games. I did some searching around online and found that most cards could go up into the hundreds with no damage. Just to be sure, I emailed the guy I bought it from (who knows just about everything there is to know about the down-and dirty details of these cards) and he said that anything under 95ºC was unlikely to cause permanent damage, and he had stress-tested some of them this high for 30 days straight. He had tens of thousands of dollars worth of this exact card in his supercomputing cluster, so he knew the specs pretty damned well and had a lot of money riding on not breaking them.

At some point, I left the temperature window visible when starting up Planetside 2. I noticed that the temperature hovered around 90ºC on the server select screen (which is far from graphically intensive). 

Again, I didn't know much about proper temperature ranges at the time, but this still seemed kind of high for what it was doing. I figured the first thing to check was if I needed to re-apply the thermal paste on the GPU. I pulled the GPU out and the heatsink is just the tiniest bit off-kilter (which I didn't really think much of at the time). So I pop off the heatsink, and there is a *lot* of thermal paste. I figured maybe this was preventing any good metal-metal contact and keeping things hot. So I start scrubbing it off the GPU with a microfiber rag, and I notice a weird semicircular discoloration on the edge of the GPU's shiny metal. I figured it was maybe some kind of laser mark, so I ignore it.

After cleaning off the GPU, I start on the heatsink, but my finger feels something elevated a tiny bit off the heatsink. After rubbing away some more thermal paste from the area, I find [this](http://imgur.com/a/ibe4z). 

This is some kind of sticker. I think it might be half of one of those QC stickers that Chinese factories slap on everything. The entire half-sticker was sandwiched between the GPU and heatsink, preventing *any* metal to metal contact in the middle of the GPU. The discoloration on the GPU was right where the sticker was.

I remove the sticker and re-apply (much less) thermal paste. Where I used to be sitting at 90ºC, I am now sitting at 50ºC. The card will not go above 60ºC, no matter how hard I push it, whereas I had seen it go into the high 90s before (presumably before it started throttling).

**TL:DR; Some idiot left a sticker between the heatsink and GPU, and somehow quality control failed to notice. This pushed my temperatures up to the high 90s when they normally would be in the high 50s.**",,False,,t5_2rnve,False,,,True,t3_14fauv,http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/14fauv/how_i_dropped_my_graphics_card_temperature_40ºc/,

He mostly plays games on his 360 and tablet but said he wants to get into computer gaming. If you can help me out it would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.

P.S. My son says he wants to be a Game Developer, are there any programs or websites that he can mess around with to create a game on. And what do i need, computer-wise, for him to use them?

EDIT- Do I need a certain case for certain components or will it all fit in ANY case. Thanks again.

EDIT 2 - I thought I had a mouse and keyboard but I do not. I would like to fit EVERYTHING into the budget of 600-700. We live in Omaha, Nebraska and we decided that we will do the build together. He starts school on Wednesday so we will take our time with ""The Build"". I've been letting him read some of the comments and he can't believe how many people are helping me. Everyone has been super nice and helpful. We even like the people with negative comments or outrageous price lists (We hope your day gets better). Thank you again and let me know if you need more info.

Once again, thank you to everyone who helped out.",,False,,t5_2rnve,1376417473.0,,,True,t3_1k75jv,http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/1k75jv/wth_was_i_thinking_need_pc_for_sons_birthday/,

I'll start with what I've observed, then give my input. Please comment with you're opinion/ idea on the matter and I would really appreciate if this was upvoted(self post) so the populous and mods can see it.

1. People are harassing other for not having knowledge in this field.
2. The ""cookie cutter"" builds have become (literally) the most common builds (within some small margin on parts) and people are often to stubborn to recognize other parts as quality.
3. Users WONT accept advice if it goes against the cookie cutter build.
4. Posters have trouble realizing they can't get what they want out of their money. 
5. Lots of vagueness is answered and often no gratitude towards people who give constructive advice/criticism. 
6. Almost half the posts on the Tech Tuesdays aren't fully addressed or even answered. 

My solutions to these (again, subject to discussion)

1. Be friendly, this subreddit is to HELP other, not be jerks to them. Give people some slack when they ask questions or say things because the might not know as much as you. Don't be mean, try to teach them or inform them on it and everyone is happy!
2. Be more open to other build ideas. Not everyone wants to use that ONE particular motherboard (we all know which one) so if the OP says he doesn't want it don't post how much better it is. If you really want to argue it ASK if the OP would consider it based on comparison that YOU provide. 
3. In reference to #2, many people refuse to acknowledge other hardware unless it's the BuildAPC special. Again, understandable but be more open to suggestion and give more options than the one from that group. ie link two or more good suggestions (if possible) to a question. 
4. Some people lately have asked if they can do certain things with an exact budget. Guess what, you won't always be able to do it. It sucks to be so close but so far, but $500 won't get you an i7, good mobo to match it, a 7970, and the other parts. Some people have had trouble acknowledging that corners need to be cut.
5. A lot of questions would be better answered with more detail and/ or more content than is now. Such as questions like ""what is different between the Gigabyte Windforce 7970 and the Saphire Vapor-X 7970
?"" Most of us would answer not much or nothing. Thank you to the people who explain the difference in the cooler design and stock OC(if applicable). 6.Lastly, the Tech Tuesdays have appeared to be a HUGE success in this subreddit, and I love that it is popular, but I hate going through and getting toward the bottom half of the posts and seeing only 1/3 of those getting answers. This isn't /r/Funny or /r/Pics where only the best stuff is up top, all of the questions deserve a chance to be answered as they are all equal. I try my best to answer the leftover but I don't always have time/knowledge. 

I would love to hear everyone else's opinions on this matter (agree, disagree, solutions, anything!) I just really want some of these things to be addressed because I believe it would hugely benefit this subreddit to be more user friendly and a more effective place.

Oh ya, here's some sweet PCs if anyone doesn't know about [this](http://www.million-dollar-pc.com/) site!

EDIT 1: 
*So after reading over ALL of the comments (I find this matter that important) I have come to a few conclusions and I have gathered some interesting information. Before I do so, I would like to thank the moderators of this thread (nubbunator and icedveil6 in particular) for being very involved in this topic and really helping me understand why things happen. Firstly, it has been stated many times that everyone will suggest an unlocked (for Intel ""k"" processor) regardless of the OPs comments on overclocking. I have seen this as well and it appears that this user base will not take no for an answer to not getting an OCable CPU. Many posts are rude and ad hominem when people say they don't want to overclock. A common response is ""well for x amount more you have the option to OC later."" If they say they don't want it, drop it. It's really that simple. This concept extends to literally every piece of hardware and every situation topic. If a user says they specifically want an AMD cpu, it's ok to recommend an Intel and state the benefits, but don't pressure them to do so. This sub is to HELP people build, not tell them what to build. 

*Transitioning into another topic, recognition of viable hardware is also a problem. When i refered to the ""cookie cutter"" builds I didn't mean it to slander those pieces of hardware (as they ARE quality), I merely meant to not shrug off other items or to refute the using of one piece over another. An example of such would be say someones wants an ASUS P8Z77 V because of the hardware features and the wifi go implement(I'm pretty sure it starts on that board as standard, correct me if I'm wrong). A respectful response would be ""You can get a similar mobo hardware wise for less(link to it here) and a PCI wireless card (again, link) and still be under budget."" Now the OP knows exactly what his choices are and what situation he is in. If he replies that he would prefer the ASUS over another mobo, don't become and elitist and offend him. Just let it go. 

*Up next is citing your claims and giving thorough responses. If you recommend an item include a link as to why and give proper reasoning in the post as to why you find it superior. Not a ton of work and it clarifies the situation that much more. If two people disagree on something get the most relevant tests you can find, present them, if the other doesn't agree still, let it go.

*Anyone notice a trend? If a user gives a budget stick to it, answer as best you can to that budget first THEN offer the ""well x item is better if you save up y more money!!!"" If the OP is on a strict budget stick to it. 

*Another notable mention would be a revamp of the sidebar and possible the post sections(maybe a way to cycle between build ready, build complete, troubleshoot, ect.) and more streamlined posting. The sidebar could give a better explanation of how the computer building process goes and how this sub contributes. Also, a GREAT idea (from JohnnyNoCares) to have a user voted build of the week/month. I'm not sure how it would all play out right now but it's something that would be nice if it was implemented. I liked this suggestion a lot: was to take the cookie cutter builds (say for 3-9 price ranges) and giving them their own spot (sidebar???). It could be like the logical increment guide but based off of the user voted parts/ builds and give suitable substitutes of close popularity. 

*A (final) point I noticed was ""what if someone asks for a build under $1200, what do we give besides a cookie cutter build?"" WELL, firstly, that type of post should be moved to /r/buildapcforme NOT buildapc. Secondly, if you DO give them ye old Reddit special explain WHY all the parts are popular, chances are they don't know. After you've done that ask if the budget is for sure or if the OP would prefer lower/higher and work off of that.

*I would like to thank everyone that commented/is commenting with solid, good ideas and views. Things like this make this sub great and by taking the great traits this sub gets to have this can become a MUCH better experience for everyone. Thanks again to the moderators for being so helpful on this, I probably never would've though of it the way you did and I'm really glad to see the devotion you guys(girls?) have for this sub!

I'm as poor as most of you folks, and I managed to scrape together a decent rig. I thought I'd jot down what helped me and gather the communities thoughts on good ways to save money. Here it goes. 


**Save money with reddit, pcpartpicker and other sites**

This is something everyone should do if they're planning on building a PC. /r/buildapcsales lists daily deals from a bunch of tech websites that will help you find awesome prices on good gear. The comments will help you figure out how good the deal is, and if you should buy now or wait til later. [PcPartPicker](https://www.pcpartpicker.com) is an amazing resource that a really nice guy has put together for the community. It lists pretty much every part, finds the website that sells it cheapest, and allows you too add all of your parts together while ensuring compatibility. It is hands down the best resource when building a new computer and will save you anywhere from $30-$100 on the average build. Even if you plan on just using one retailer (you can do that on the site), you still wind getting the best comparison of product ratings and prices that you'll find anywhere. aPudgyMasonManE also suggested using many companies price match policy to ensure the lowest prices from your preferred retailer. Nubbinator suggested a few other websites for finding deals as well as ways to get ahold of coupon codes through promotional newsletters and social media [in this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/104ye3/how_to_save_money_when_you_buildapc/c6aj2k8) 

**Buy used parts**

If you're on a budget, don't turn your nose up at used parts. On reddit, /r/hardwareswap has a lot of stuff for sale. Forums such as [those on tomshardware](http://www.tomshardware.com/forum/forum-8.html) provide an excellent opportunity to snag up good hardware at a low price. A lot of high end builders replace their rig regularly and that means you can get some beefy old-gen parts on a dime. You won't have warranties, and ordering from folks online has its necessary perils but if you're really looking to save money... it's worth it. 


**Open box, refurbished items and combo deals**

Lots of sites (like newegg) have refurbished and open box items. These are often around 20% or more off, and sometimes you'll catch great deals on the stuff you would have bought anyway. Check to make sure you still have a warranty (you generally do, with some changes) and that you understand that warranty. It's actually awesome when they crap out on you, because that means you get a new piece of hardware. The one thing I won't buy refurbished is a hard drive, but that's just personal preference. Sites like newegg often offer combo deals which will save you money for buying certain combinations of items. You can check them [here](http://www.newegg.com/Special/Combo.aspx?listType=combo&amp;amp;name=Combo-Deals).

**Plan your upgrades**

A lot of folks spend more and more money on trying to future proof their computer. While there is nothing wrong with this, it might not be ideal for everyone. This is due to the diminishing returns associated with future proofing. To highlight this, imagine you spent $1200 on a computer. You hope to get 4 years of solid use and gaming out of it. What'd I'd recommend is to spend a lot less now, say ($700). In two years you can spend the remaining $500 on a new Mobo/Ram/CPU/GPU and upgrade your rig. Hardware changes rapidly, and $500 two years from now is going to buy you more computing power than you could ever afford now. In two years, your computer becomes current again and faster than it would have been had you spent $1200 now. (Those verb tenses got weird). Your PSU, case, fans, and DVD/CD-ROM drive will last multiple builds, so you won't need to upgrade them. Bonus: plan the upgrade in the early summer. Sell your old computer parts after you build your new computer, and drop that money on the steam summer sale. You've upgraded your computer and bought a bunch of games. 



**Saving money for gaming, skip the fancy CPU**

If you're primarily interested in gaming and on a budget, it might be a good idea to scale back your CPU and dump that money into your video card. I'm not going to go too much into current hardware, since that will make this guide outdated in just a month or two, but there are generally CPUs that will fulfill all your gaming needs for around $100 bucks.  AMD has traditionally been the leader in budget gaming, but their recent bulldozer launch has been less than successful giving Intel's i3's a competitive edge. This will likely reverse itself in the future and I'm sure we'll see better cheap stuff coming out of AMD. A $100 CPU and a $200 GPU will always be a better gaming computer than a $200 CPU and a $100 GPU. For higher end builds, after you're spending ~$3-400 on your GPU it becomes worth it to invest in an intel CPU. 


**Roll back that motherboard**

What features do you need out of your computer? Make a list. How many SATA drives? How many USB ports? Do you need onboard video? Use this list to find which motherboard fulfills your needs at a low price. Make sure its ratings are good, but don't spend more money than you need to for extra USB headers or overclocking features that you don't plan on using. I remember years ago a friend wanted to use a DFI lan party board (do those still exist?) for a word processing machine. Total waste of cash. speed_demonv2 pointed out that you probably don't need SLI/crossfire support if you're on a budget and not planning on adding a second card in the next 6 months to a year. Also, there is a lot of debate (that is beyond the scope of this article) about the value of SLI/crossfire for all but the highest end builds. You're usually better off spending the money on a twice as expensive video card. A GTX 560 Ti is marginally better than 2 x 550 Ti's... for example. 


**APUs for super budget gaming and other computer tasks**

APUs have integrated GPUs that enable you to save the money you would spend on a video card. These integrated GPUs aren't amazing, but they should handle some light gaming. This is particularly great for non-gaming builds as it enables you to save a pretty hefty chunk of money.  If you do plan on gaming in the future, you can simply add a video card as needed. These shouldn't be used for high end builds, but for budget builds where not a lot of graphics power is necessary they can't be beat. 


**What not to scrimp on**

There are certain parts of your computer that you should make sure to spend money on, because it will actually save you money in the long run. A good case will last you multiple builds, and save you endless frustration when you begin to do cable management. Some good options are the HAF 912 and the Antec One, both of which are right around $50 bucks. It's not a lot of money, but you'll get a ton more out of these cases than you will out of bargain $30 cases. The second major place to not scrimp is in the PSU. A lot of people view PSUs as all being the same, but a good PSU will last a couple builds and has a lower chance of frying your components. Unstable voltages can make for really weird stuff happening that can be difficult to troubleshoot. If you want to save money on your PSU, the best way to do it is to avoid buying a PSU that puts out more than you need. If you're doing an APU Home theater PC (HTPC) build, there is no reason to buy a 1000W power supply. Power supply calculators as well as the wattage feature on pcpartpicker will help you estimate your power consumption needs. As far as energy efficiency, Namell pointed out that bronze is usually sufficient for most folks. The benefits of a very efficient power supply are mainly felt by those who leave their computer on all day doing intensive stuff (e.g. folding at home). In these cases you may actually save money going gold. 


**Using an old computer as a base**

Many of us have trouble saving but want to get a computer up and running. If you have access to a somewhat recent computer, around 2 or 3 years old you can open it up and see what's useful. Chances are it has a CD/DVD drive that you can use as well as a hard drive that will work decently (though it will be slower than current gen). Some old computers will even have useful power supplies, but this is getting into the riskier territory of used parts. Most manufacturers use crappy PSUs. Finally, if the form factor of the motherboard is not proprietary you may be able to use the case to house your new parts. You could even build your own case.... 

**Saving money on an OS/Software**

The cheapest OS out there is linux and there many amazing distros (such as Mint, Ubuntu) that are pretty user friendly. If you're not using your computer for a lot of windows-only apps or gaming you might be able to get by just using Linux. If you need windows, a .edu email address can get you a cheap student edition upgrade copy. Even if you're not a student, upgrade copies can be installed if you own a previous license to windows XP or Vista (which you probably do if you have any computer built in the last 10 years. There is even a ""double install"" trick which can allow it to be installed fresh. If upgrade copies aren't an option, OEM versions of windows don't have as much support but are often cheaper and good for system builders. Finally, look at the different features each version of windows has and choose what is right for you. On other software, be on the lookout for student versions of stuff. CrobisauerCroney pointed out that many schools have a dreamspark or similar deal with Microsoft that gets you free visual studio and other software. If you were budgeting for software, student deals might be able to save you a lot of cash. Also, depending on your needs, consider open source alternatives like openoffice, gimp (instead of photoshop), etc... [Ninite](https://www.ninite.com) will help you find and install most software that you'll need. 


**Incremental builds**

A lot of folks want to buy parts a little at a time. Generally, it's best to buy everything more or less at once. Knowledgeable folks can use at most a 2 month period to shop the best deals and look for good clearance/refurb/open box items.. but make sure you read up on hardware changes so you don't accidentally obsolete your system. If you're splitting stuff up by greater than 2 months (say a birthday and christmas) it's best to do the following. Purchase the DVD/CD-ROM drive first because their prices haven't changed much in the past decade. Next you can buy the case and PSU because they don't tend to change formats often and tend to be the most future-proof of computer parts. Once you know what case and PSU you have you can start buying fans and putting them in. Finally, buy your Motherboard, Ram, CPU, GPU and hard drive all at the same time. These parts change in value the fastest. This will ensure that you don't spend more money on a a part just to have it drop in price before you don't get the chance to use it. Branislav mentioned that price alerts for incremental builders can help save a lot of money. They can be done on pcpartspicker as well as newegg. For info on price alerts, check out [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/104ye3/how_to_save_money_when_you_buildapc/c6ag7d4)

**A word of caution about saving money**

When you're watching for deals or trying to take advantage of combos, it's important to weigh the money saved vs. the quality of the part. It's a bad idea to buy a cheap or slow part simply because it is on sale. It's good to stick to quality manufacturers and parts that fit your needs. Buying a part you don't really want simply because it's $10 cheaper than it normally is will just be something you regret. You'll have to make decisions based on what you want out of your computer and how much you value the money saved. Always read reviews. 

**What to do with all that money you saved**

So you followed this guide, built your PC and saved a lot of money. Now give it to me. Just kidding! One good thing to do (if you can afford it) is to donate some of the savings to [CFY](https://www.redditdonate.com/donate/69).

1320632171.0,524,self.buildapc,m30sm,Understanding motherboards.,603,79,91,http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/m30sm/understanding_motherboards/,"I find that the component most people are baffled by in a computer is the motherboard.  I'm mostly writing this so I can easily link to this basic explanation, since I find myself constantly writing out what to look for in a motherboard.  Please feel free to offer corrections or add information, as I am in no way all-knowing.

When it comes to buying a motherboard, you can break down what to look for into the following categories:

1. Reliability.
2. Overclocking ability.
3. Compatibility.
4. Chipset.
5. Ports/plugs/slots/features.

### Reliability
Reliability is really just about doing your homework.  Find out what brands and models are trusted.  Opinions here are going to vary, especially when personal experience comes into play.  I include customer support in this category as well.  This goes for almost all components of a PC, but don't get a motherboard that is manufactured by an unknown brand.  It's just not worth it.  Get something that you *know* will be reliable.  Ask around.  See what the folks who know what they're doing are suggesting, and of course, ask around.

Some examples of commonly-bought brands for motherboards are MSI, ASUS, GIGABYTE, ASRock, and EVGA.  Intel makes motherboards as well, but I don't really ever see anyone actually buy them.


### Overclocking Ability
Overclocking requires extra power to run to the components being OC'd.  A motherboard with sturdier parts will be able to handle more power flow stably, allowing your to overclock more and longer.  Typically, a more expensive motherboard will have better parts, but that is not necessarily the case.  [As suggested by ICantSeeIt](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/m30sm/understanding_motherboards/c2xpqng), 
&gt;an easy way to get a rough idea of what sort of overclocking a board can handle is to look at the heatsinks on the motherboard's chipsets. A better heatsink will keep the chipset cooler and let you overclock higher and at higher voltages (typically). However, just looking nice is no substitute for actually being good, so do your research as well.

Keep in mind that this is just a quick way to eyeball things.  There is no replacement for proper research and feedback.

An example motherboard that overclocks well would be the ASRock Extreme3 Gen3 or ASRock Extreme4 Gen3, motherboards I happen to suggest a lot.  If anyone would like to offer more, I'll gladly add them.  I just don't want to add anything that I don't know for a fact to be good for overclocking.

### Compatibility
Pretty much everything in a PC connects to the motherboard directly, so compatibility is a pretty big deal.  You'll need the following to be compatible with your motherboard:

* **RAM (also known as memory)**
RAM generally comes in either pairs or triplets.  This is for a reason.  Motherboards will support either double- or triple-channel RAM slots, allowing either two or three RAM sticks to work together, respectively.  If you plug three RAM sticks into a dual-channel motherboard or two sticks into a triple-channel one, you will not be taking full advantage of your RAM and motherboard's capabilities at all.  Most sites selling motherboards will state in the details/specs section whether it is dual- or triple-channel.  Be sure you know which it is and to buy RAM accordingly.  (Quick note: it is currently most common for people to buy dual-channel motherboards)
Additionally, make sure the RAM you are getting is **desktop** RAM.  This will be 240pin memory (just for safesies, check your motherboard matches up - it should).  Finally, make sure your memory speeds are compatible.  The current standard is DDR3.  Make sure the standards match up.  DDR2 can only fit in DDR2.  DDR3 can only fit in DDR3.  Make sure the speed, which should be listed immediately following DDR3 matches your RAM.  Usually it's 1333 or 1600, but sometimes it can be 1800, 2000, 2133, or others.

* **CPU (AKA the processor)**  This one is easy.  Just look at the CPU's supported by the motherboard.  If they share the same socket type (Intel's Sandy Bridge generation uses LGA 1155, while AMD's current gen uses AM3+).  Some sites, such as [Newegg.com](www.newegg.com), will also state which actual CPU's are supported, ie ""Core i7 / i5 / i3 (LGA1155)"" or ""FX / Phenom II / Athlon II / Sempron 100 Series.""

* **Form Factor and Cases**  This pretty much means size and shape, following a certain standard.  Some of the more popular standards are micro ATX, ATX (by far the most popular - it's the standard of standards), and Extended ATX.  These are from smallest to largest.  Smaller motherboards can fit into smaller cases, but can't as easily offer as many features (see: ports/plugs/slots).  Extended ATX motherboards require a larger case, but can fit more on them.  Meanwhile, ATX is somewhere in between, and almost any case, unless it is a very small one, will have proper fittings for an ATX board.  Make sure your motherboard is compatible with your case by checking the form factors supported by your case.

* **Power Pin** Not usually a difficult thing to match compatibly, but make sure the power pin will match that offered by your power supply.


### Chipset
~~The chipset is more or less how the CPU interacts with the RAM.  It used to be that a motherboard would have a North Bridge and a South Bridge, but now Intel has moved away from the South Bridge, and now only has a North Bridge.  AMD still has both.  The difference between chipsets can matter, but not necessarily in any big way.  The Front Side Bus is the measurement of how quickly the CPU can communicate with the RAM and rest of the computer (wording taken from [Veidt's excellent post here](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/cw8ms/what_do_the_specifications_of_a_motherboard_mean/))~~

Balls.  The memory controller has moved from the chipset to the CPU.  Now the CPU determines what memory is compatible, but you will still be able to see what motherboard is compatible with what memory, as a motherboard is restriced to what CPU's it can work with, so that defines its memory compatibility as well.  The chipset is now just how the CPU communicates with the computer.

For example, Intel's newest chipset for their Sandy Bridge processors is the Z68.  The previously used chipset was P67, which is still in circulation.  The Z68 is hands-down superior, but it might not be necessary to get it.  If all else is equal, including price, definitely go with the newer chipset.  Just keep in mind that the advantages of the Z68 are not necessarily going to affect you in any real way.

* **SSD Caching** If you have an SSD, the Z68 supports SSD caching, which, if the OS is on a HDD, will allow the computer to use a SSD as a cache.  This is better than a OS simply running on a HDD with no SSD involved whatsoever, but if you have a SSD and your OS is on your HDD, you're doing it wrong.

* **Transcoding** If you're going to be transcoding video a lot, the Z68 supports Quicksync, which will speed up transcoding.

* **Integrated graphics**  The Z68 also supports integrated graphics processing, but it's unlikely you'll need that, though it can be nice to have as a backup in case your GPU fails.

If a Z68 board costs more than an equivalent P67 board, weigh these.  See if you would still prefer the Z68.

When comparing chipsets, a quick Google should answer whatever questions you have about the differences.

### Ports/Plugs/Slots/Features

This comes down to preference.  There are many difference things to plug into different things.  I'll list a bunch here and explain what each is and why (if) it matters.  Figure out what all you'll need/want and make sure your prospective motherboard has them or you can get an adapter to plug into your computer (make sure you can plug the adapter in then instead).

* **PCI slots (AKA expansion slots)**  This might get a bit confusing.  Try to stay with me here.  There are varying generations of PCI slots.  PCI Express (PCI-E) is the current standard, and PCI-E 2.0 is the current generation within that standard, and PCI-E 2.0 x16 is the current desirable speed within that generation within that standard.  Note that PCI-E 3.0 x16 will be moving into that position in a little while, so for the purposes of upgradability, you might want to get a board that has one or two of those slots, but I wouldn't sweat it too much just yet.  Anyway, different expansion cards require different expansions slots in order to function properly at their intended speed.  You want to put a GPU into a PCI-E 2.0 x16 slot.  If you plan on using SLI/Crossfire, you'll want to find out if, when you plug both GPU's in, will the two slots function as x16/x4 or x8/x8 or what-have-you.  The same goes for more GPU's.  If the motherboard can't handle process your information very quickly, then throwing those babies into dual/triple/quadruple mode isn't gonna help as much as it could.  If I'm not mistaken, no card out there will saturate a PCI-E 2.0 x16 slot, so don't worry about anything past that.  Beyond PCI-E 2.0 x16, you'll want to come up with a quick tally of what other things you'll need to plug into your expansion slots (wireless network cards, T.V. tuners, etc), figure out what kind of slot they'll need, and make sure your motherboard supports the addition.  If anyone would like to elaborate further, please feel free, or if anyone can come up with a way to better format this bullet -_-.

* **PATA Support**  PATA is the old standard for storage support.  If you have some old piece of hardware that you will want to use with your computer and is PATA only, you might want a motherboard that supports this.

[WCCTech Rundown](http://wccftech.com/amd-launches-generation-aseries-richland-apus-desktop-fm2-platform/)

~~-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------~~

The AMD A10-6800K Black Edition in some ways is all the CPU you will ever need. With 4 cores and a stock speed of 4.10GHz, which automatically turbo's upto 4.40GHz when required, this CPU can handle anything you throw at it. Even more impressive is the overclocking ability of these processors with some reaching near and over 5GHz on air cooling.

The main and best feature of the A10-6800k is the onboard IGP, the HD 8670D which is equivalent in gaming performance to a HD 7750 and can actually play any game including the latest titles with moderate quality settings. In our own testing Borderlands 2 at 1920x1080 with all details on medium/maximum was more than playable, with smooth frame rates. However it is very important with the FM2 platform to use high speed memory as the onboard IGP gets a serious performance boost with faster memory upto 2400MHz.

For those who require more graphics performance, adding a HD 6670 / HD 7750 to the mix will enable Hybrid Crossfire giving upto approx 80% additional performance in modern gaming titles, making this new platform viable for entry level gaming machines that can play the latest gaming titles.

Features:

* Blazing fast computing from 384 AMD Radeon™ cores 2.0 featuring DirectX® 11 capable graphics.
* Immerse yourself in the awe of AMD HD3D gaming.
* Unlock all the control and performance of the 2nd generation AMD A-Series Processor when you select the overclockable Black Edition.
* Eyeinfinity Support (Upto 3 monitors)
* World class APU designed for amazing graphics, gaming and compute performance.
* Up to 779 GFLOPS of compute performance
* Up to 10% performance increase in 3D Graphics over AMD Trinity

Specification:

* 4 cores (Quad Core technology)
* 4.10GHz Stock speed
* 4.40GHz Turbo speed
* 4MB Cache
* Multiplier Unlocked (Great for overclocking)
* 100W TDP
* Onboard IGP: HD 8670D, 844MHz Core speed, 384 Stream Processors
* Hybrid Crossfire Capable with HD 6670 / HD 7750
* 3yr Warranty

Had to buy a few SATA III and DVI cables and whatnot as part of the build, too.  All in all, it worked out to roughly $4200 including tax.  I picked a GTX 580 Classified over a GTX 680 because Nvidia crippled the CUDA cores on the Kepler chips to improve gaming performance at the cost of CS6/Autodesk/CATIA/etc speeds.  RAID 0 SSDs have a higher failure rate than one SSD but since he's doing large sequential reads and writes off of the drive with HD/4K footage and all of his valuable data will be on the storage array, it's worth it.  The four 3TB Barracudas are in RAID 10.  i7 3930K is currently at 4.2 GHz with a *lot* of overclocking headroom.

I've been very content with both brands, and so I will not try to promote any brand over the other.

____

**My claim** in this post is as follows: The video from the ""It's time to rethink EVERTHING."" post (which can be found here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eu8Sekdb-IE) is an example of horrible journalism and factual inaccuracy. It should be taken with two grains and a tablespoon of salt.

____

**My ground** for saying so is this:
If an AMD CPU can get you 100FPS in a game and an Intel CPU can get you 170FPS they will still look equal if the graphics card used in the test can only render 90FPS. Then you get results like this: http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/fx-8350-vishera-review,3328-13.html

The review in the video shows similar results (they're pretty equal).

___

**My rebuttal** in this toulmin-based argument is as follows:

The video review as well as the test, I linked to above do in fact seem to show that the CPUs are equal in terms of speed. That is correct.

____


**My warrant** in this argument is as follows:

If, instead of using high grahics settings in a test, you lower the graphics setting to a minimum, so that the graphics card does no longer limit the framerate, a test will accurately show the relative performance of the CPUs.

___

**My data** to back this warrant is this:


**Link 1: (cinebench)**

http://hothardware.com/Reviews/AMD-FX-8350-Vishera-8Core-CPU-Review/?page=7

Notice how the multithreaded performance of the two chips are relatively close, but also how the Intel CPUs are up to than 50% faster in the single-threaded tests.

This goes to show that a program, game or application that can fully utilize all 8 cores on an AMD FX CPU, will run just about equally fast on both chips. In applications that cannot, Intel usually wins.

**Link 2 (gaming):**

http://hothardware.com/Reviews/AMD-FX-8350-Vishera-8Core-CPU-Review/?page=8

Notice how the actual performance difference is visible in the test, once the game settings are set at a minimum.
**Also notice** how this test show the potential number of frames per second, the CPU would be able to render with **high settings** considering a fast enough graphics card was used.

That the test in the video shows Crysis to render less than 50FPS is proof that the test is GPU limited and that you're looking at this kind of landscape:
http://www.guru3d.com/articles_pages/amd_fx_8350_processor_review,18.html

**Notice** how in the Far Cry 2 test, the graphics setup is capable of rendering about 180 FPS at the lowest resolution with ALL the Intel quad cores. This is where the GPU limit starts to kick in. All the AMD CPUs are upwards of 107FPS at the same setting.

When the resolution is bumped to FULL HD, the GPU limit is met faster - at 130FPS. The Intel CPUs are all faster than that, so they can fully utilize the GPU (A GTX580) and all score about 130FPS. The AMD scores remain largely unaffected - they're still upwards of 105FPS. This shows that the AMD systems are bottlenecked by the CPU.

____

**My final blow to the credibility of the video** is this:

The graphics card used in the video review is an HD7870. This is a card that can render 88FPS in Guru3d's test in Full HD resolution:

Since we have just shown that the AMD FX-8350 is capable of getting 100FPS at those settings (provided you use a fast enough graphics card), the HD7870 WILL limit the CPU in the test - this means that using an HD7870 to test an Intel Core i5 against an AMD FX-8350 will almost always make them look equal.

Some games are more CPU-reliant - in those games, Intel may win even when using an HD7870. Some games are less CPU reliant - in those, the chips may look equal even with an HD7950.



____

**My conclusion** in this post is that the video review is completely unreliable. If you're playing video games, you will run into CPU limitations earlier with an AMD cpu than with an Intel CPU. Therefore, if you plan to run a multi-GPU setup or in some other way use a very powerful graphics solution, you're still MUCH better off with an Intel Core i5 CPU than an 8-core AMD FX.

If you're not using a super fast graphics card, you will run into GPU limitations first and never notice a difference in CPU performance.

This does not make AMD CPUs worse than Intel - in fact, I can still recommend AMD just as highly as Intel if you're going to use your computer for just about anything but gaming. It is also my view that a CPU monopoly would be a horrible thing, and it is my hope that AMD could find a way to improve the single-threaded performance of their chips and take a bigger portion of the market. My recommendations for the two brands are still so close that it only takes a ""good deal"" on a given chip for it to shift between the brands.

____

**TL;DR: (Or the short explanation if you will)** If his test is limited by the CPU, the video shows a guy claim that a new Core i5 CPU is unable to attain more than 27FPS in crysis warhead. This can be disproven quite easily:
http://www.guru3d.com/articles_pages/amd_phenom_x4_945_and_955be_processor_review|test,18.html

This alone should be enough to dismiss the video. For another couple of arguments and technical details, read the entire post.

Built as an HTPC running Windows 7 for my missus and her flatmates.

Done with a small budget, a dremel, and an idea to upgraded it in the future. Most of it was bought new spending cost just above £200, with a few things, like the DVD drive, sourced from my pile of old kit.

The original power/reset buttons &amp; light work properly, and i've swapped the controller ports for USBs, and it is completely fanless. It would be silent if it weren't for the HDD clicking &amp; the old DVD drive.
Messed around with some EL wire and tape in there but it's pretty cramped, wanted some Tron-style glow coming out of it.

It's been operational for 6 months now and havn't had a problem with it to date. Set up to hibernate after 30 minutes to save the risk of overheating, but it has done marathons of Film &amp; TV on XBMC with no problems, and days worth of streaming sport.

My proudest achievement to date!

**EDIT**: Thanks for all of the comments and advice, everyone! The modifications that I will be considering are:

1. Sound dampening foam with a sticky side to place inside the case.  I will probably do the two inner sides and the bottom of the lid.  Possibly other smaller areas if I find it helpful.

2. A ground wire from i/o shield to psu. I'm not sure how risky it is not to do this, but it's easy enough to add on.

3. Cpu cooler so that i can overclock. I am thinking something like the [Noctua NH-U12P SE2](http://www.newegg.ca/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16835608024) since i care about quietness and i have clearance of 18cm for a big cooler. I'm still **very** open to suggestions on this choice...

4. Possibly taking advantage of [this deal on the HIS 7870 IceQ](http://www.memoryexpress.com/Products/MX39013) to optimize quieter living room gameplay and giving my current XFX 7870 core edition to my gf's pc.

EDIT3: A new guide sometime soon on picking everything CPU related. CPU and cpu cooler etc. 

**EDIT4: MUAHHAHA MY PLAN WAS A SUCCESS! Thanks for the gold /u/pcpartpicker**

So, you’re ready to build a pc. That’s great, but here at reddit we don’t just upvote anything that the cat drags in. To ensure you get the best advice and your parts are generally compatible, most of use a website called PCpartpicker.com. It has a lot of great features which we’ll go into detail with, and also provides easy ways to get your content onto reddit.

To begin, let’s start at the start of the website.

[Here](http://i.imgur.com/JtEymCu.png)

Click the big gold button, that’ll get you to this page

[here](http://i.imgur.com/JUB3Fov.png)

From there, you can start building . Clicking each of the components and going from top to bottom is generally the best idea (hence why it’s spread out in this manner) To begin, let’s “choose a CPU”

You should see something like this

[Here](http://i.imgur.com/BkySEAL.png)

Now, at first it will be a little confusing. Firstly, the CPU’s will be ordered by name, so AMD will be at the top and intel will be down near the bottom. To rectify this, you should look on the right and notice the panel titled “Manufacturer” from here, select intel or AMD to filter your results. Since mama said go intel or get the fuck out, we’re building intel. After selecting intel, we want to choose the family of processers or the series of processors. The newest family of intel CPU’s is haswell, and before that were sandy bridge and ivy bridge. If you have no preference for age and prefer series, select core i3/i5/i7 or core 2 duo etc.

Once you’ve picked your processor, click on the “view” button, it should look like this:

[here](http://i.imgur.com/2zBOZqL.jpg)

From there you can see more stats about the part etc as well as prices and deals. Select “add to parts list” and bam, you should now look like this:

[Here](http://i.imgur.com/WEfK7BV.png)

Notice how the CPU is now in the slot? This is great as now that part is “locked in” ready for posting to reddit. You can change the part or remove/buy the part at any time. Now that that hard bit of picking our first part is chosen, let’s move onto the next stage. Click on choose a motherboard. Just to show something  cool, I’ve chosen an AMD only motherboard with an Intel motherboard. (Note that normally, pcpartpicker has a “compatibility filter” that doesn’t show things that are totally incompatible. Sometimes things are “semi-compatible” aka, the GPU has a very short clearance inside of the case, or the motherboard doesn’t have enough ports or the powersupply doesn’t have enough cables for you to use. This is shown below)

[Here](http://i.imgur.com/HsnieKQ.png)

If this happens, remove the part you chose and try again.

After a hard day of slogging it out and picking all the ~~best parts~~ most expensive parts for your shiny new pc, you should look something like this:

[here](http://i.imgur.com/da13K4E.png)

Pretty fancy right? Now, onto the juicy bits. The highlighted bit that says “pcpartpicker/reddit markup” has what you want when you want to post it to reddit. If you include this, &gt;9000 upvotes and women will make sweet sweet love to you enternally and shower you with advice (we promise no-one will call you build ‘fucking retarded’ and ‘ur a faget’ might only be said once or twice)
The other highlighted bit is the estimated wattage. This’ll tell you roughly how much watts your PSU will need to be. Generally speaking, go a couple hundred higher than what it says there.

The final highlighted bit is the “compatibility”, if all things go right, then you should have a green thing there. If somethings wrong, it’ll be red. If it’s red, scroll down until you see what the hell your stupid ass was thinking, and how to fix it.

Now, for the hardest bit. Begin your post to reddit. Click on the pcpartpicker/reddit markup and you’ll see something like this

[Here](http://i.imgur.com/FX2CrBn.png)

While it looks like a t-rex had a seizure on your keyboard, I promise it’ll look a lot better on reddit. Copy paste it then go to www.reddit.com/r/buildapc and click “submit new text post” on the sidebar.

For the title something like this:

[Here](http://i.imgur.com/MDKcOYK.png)

Should suffice. Only the “[build ready] is really needed. Past that make sure to insult the mods and say reddit is shit anyway and you’re going to start your own reddit with blackjack and hookers.
In the text area, paste the stuff you copied from pcpart picker. For my example, it looks like this:

EDIT: /u/fp4 's tips:

Other tips:

* Un-check the Mail in Rebate box on the Price Filter box when select a component if you don't plan to use them.
* Customize the Merchant list to only display prices from Merchants you plan to use.
* Verify that the price you're expecting is the same on the website, and that it's in stock. I've noticed Microcenter prices will be listed with the MIR built in but not actually specified on PCPartPicker which causes it to be [$20 more in the case of the GTX 660](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/pny-video-card-vcggtx660xpb).
* Shipping costs aren't always calculated in the total, you may need to re-factor your build if shipping costs put you over budget.

I downloaded my Ninite script and set it up through Windows task scheduler to have it run every time I log on to make sure all my essential programs are up to date.

First what is Ninite? Ninite is a script that you download that checks programs you have selected and sees if you have them installed on your computer. If you don't Ninite will install them. If you do have them Ninite will check to see if there is a newer version. If there is not Ninite will skip the program.

Does Ninite skip all the toolbars and such? Yes Ninite automatically selects no on the ""add-ons"". Ninite will also make sure it downloads the correct version for your system. So if you have a 64-bit system Ninite will download both the 32-bit java and the 64-bit java.

Now, here are my instructions along with pictures!:


* Step 1: Go to [Ninite.com](http://ninite.com). You will get to a website that looks something like [this](http://imgur.com/uoq5b)


* Step 2: [Select your essential programs](http://imgur.com/LLZPI) such as your web browsers, your security programs, your runtime programs, your file sharing programs, etc.


* Step 3: Click the [get installer](http://imgur.com/GAuE7) down at the bottom

* Step 4: Drag the script to [your desktop](http://imgur.com/CPsFG) or some file location. Remember this location as this will be critical in the later parts of setting up the task.

* Step 5: Open [up start](http://imgur.com/iCU6K) and search for [""task scheduler""](http://imgur.com/6JJps) and click it.

* Step 6: Click on [basic task](http://imgur.com/e4VCu) in the window.

* Step 7: Put in name for the task and a description. Click next.

* Step 8: Put in a trigger. Basically do you want it to run daily? When you log on? Weekly? Click next.

* Step 9: After selecting a trigger select start a program.

* Step 10: Put in the file location for the Ninite script. Click next and then finish. Your computer is now up to date.

1364589328.0,469,self.buildapc,1b9hsh,"Just picked up a new IPS monitor... holy CRAP, you guys, these things are awesome. Comparison pics inside!",616,147,251,http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/1b9hsh/just_picked_up_a_new_ips_monitor_holy_crap_you/,"I was in the market for a second monitor anyway, and I decided to get one of these brilliant slower-but-prettier IPS panels I'd heard so much about.  I figured if the response time was really so bad that I couldn't game on it, at least it would make my movies pop a bit, right?

What I ended up buying was the [Asus PA248Q](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=24-236-287).  The panel inside is the same as the one in the highly-regarded Dell U2412M, but the ASUS also includes an HDMI port (which I needed to hook it up to my laptop - seriously, I have *no* idea why Dell would leave that out) and a 4x USB 3.0 hub.

It came yesterday, so I hooked it up to make sure it worked (which it did, perfectly - no dead/stuck pixels, no backlight flickering or bleeding, etc.).  But almost immediately, I could tell that the color on this thing was something different.

So I decided to take some movie stills and then photograph both screens for comparison.  Obviously these aren't *directly* representative of the difference, as 1) they were taken with a phone camera (a decent one, but a phone camera nonetheless), and 2) you're probably viewing this on a TN monitor, which makes it kind of like running HDTV ads on an SD screen.  But the *relative* difference should be pretty clear.

http://imgur.com/a/QVfKO#0

Honestly, I really didn't think the color difference would be *that* stark.  It's not like anyone walks away from a TN screen and thinks ""wow, that looked washed out.""  It just doesn't occur to you that there could actually be more colors to show.  But there are!  *There are more colors out there* - and every cheapass TN panel you've ever stared at is leaving you (often literally) in the dark.

---

Of course, I also did a couple hours of game testing.  For all the talk you hear about slow refresh rates and input lag on these things, I certainly didn't notice it.  Granted, I don't really play twitch shooters - but I threw Bastion and TF2 at it, and subjectively it felt as smooth and responsive as any TN panel I've ever played on.

Now, this particular monitor gets high marks for its lack of input lag, and also lists 6ms G2G refresh (better than the usual 8ms for consumer IPS panels), so other models may be a bit worse in this area.  Still, since I had *no* issue with this panel's responsiveness, I definitely wouldn't blacklist IPS for gaming use.  It's just a factor to keep in mind as you do your own research and account for your own needs.

---

It seems to me that buying an IPS panel is sort of like buying an SSD.  No you don't strictly *need* it, yes it costs a not-insignifcant premium over the equivalent alternative - but once you've experienced the difference, you'll never go back.

I'm hoping to release the guide completely by the end of the month so I'm looking for some people to read through it and point out any mistakes I have made whether it be in content or grammar. I just want to make sure that everything is right before I put it out there for everyone.

I am looking into ways of hosting it on iTunes and amazon as free ebooks as well as looking into other forms of hosting. I will offer it for free as a .pdf for anyone who would like it.

**GAMING FRAMES PER SECOND @ 1920x1080, 60Hz**  
^(Rough FPS estimates with MSI On-Screen display on top left corner, unless the game provides a built-in benchmark.)  

VSync ON tries to match the game's FPS to screen's refresh rate (mine is 60Hz).  
VSync OFF allows the game's FPS to pass screen's refresh rate, but can lead to image tearing.

In-depth info with pros and cons can be found in [this /r/buildapc post on VSync](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/1544hx/explaining_vsync_and_other_things/).

Aww yeah. I'm pretty happy with my first build! Feeling very accomplished. I went with a mATX build because I plan on bringing it around every so often to friends' houses or gaming nights at school.

I learned a bunch of things about computers and the computing community on the way. 

Some bad, some good.

* **The ""PC Master Race"" mentality irks me**

This is what I learned almost instantly. I've been always both a console and PC gamer for a while now (I still have my Atari 2600/Sega Genesis, and CS 1.6 was the PC game that started it all). 

I enjoy consoles mostly for ""hey-we're-all-on-the-same-sofa multiplayer"" games like Super Smash Bros, Rock Band, Black Ops Zombies, etc.

I enjoy computers mostly for ""hey-one-person-per-battlestation multiplayer"" games like League of Legends, World of Warcraft, Team Fortress 2, etc.

This ""PC vs Console"" thing has been going on for a long time, but almost on every single Xbox One/PS4/Wii U post there's always that someone who says, ""Oh, psssh, just build a PC!"", sometimes followed by some berating/degrading remark about consoles, then followed by something about cost, games, sales, ""I can do my homework"", ""It's an investment"", etc. Now most of these are true, but if you're going to convince someone to switch on over to PCs, you're not going to do so with condescending ""I'm better than you"" statements. 

The guys who participate in the PC vs Console make *everyone* look bad. Once I got deep into the PC community (where people discuss different computer parts and whatnot), that's when someone can see that the community is as great a community as any other.

* **It's not *that* easy as putting together Lego pieces (as a first-timer)**

People always said this, but it's not *that* easy. Sure, maybe putting in the parts is like Legos, but everything else is a bit harder. 

I did day after day research for several weeks, searching through random forums and sites for CPU, GPU, motherboard, etc info. I had my laptop open with a bunch of Newegg videos, and all of my user manuals open all around me. It took me at about 3-4 hours to put it together, with a couple errors here and there. Then another 4-5 hours of getting the OC, drivers, software up and running correctly, *and* I downloaded the drivers to a flash drive beforehand! I spent the few following days double/triple checking everything from cables, fans, temperatures, etc. Around my area, the cost of hiring someone who knows what they're doing is about $50, but I'm not willing to spend that much (saving money is one of the reasons of this computer).

There's a whooole lot of time you need to invest in this to make sure you do everything correctly, learning all these random number/letter technology acronyms and terms, finding out that what you *thought* was the same thing was actually a *different version* of that thing you thought was the same thing, learning what fits with what in what next to what with this much what, and so on. Man. That leads me into...

* **I hate acronyms and fancy product names**

Why couldn't they have named it Awesome GPU 1, Awesome GPU 2, Awesome GPU 2A, etc.? It's embarrassing for me to say the specs of a computer. It all just so overly complicated for no reason other than to sound cool and hip and high tech-y, in my opinion.


* **Building a desktop PC is rewarding**

It feels *sooo* good when you short that circuit and seeing all the fans whirr up. All of the knowledge you gained, all of the money you saved, all of the time you spent on research, all of it goes into that one moment. Makes you feel like a pro that knows what he/she is doing! And then seeing it all work after putting it in your shiny new case... hnnnnngh. Now I treat my computer like a little baby. Your computer is to you as a car is to a car person.

* **Almost everything about a desktop PC is great**

Pretty much it's all been beat to death about the cost, game sales, versatility, etc. I can do my homework and play nice games whenever I want (just as long as I'm home). Maybe the only downsides are that it's not *as* portable and convenient as a console (I bring my 360slim/Wii around a lot). If I wanted portability or convenience in a PC, I would need to spend additional money for a laptop, a smaller case, a pre-built computer, or to hire someone. Pros and cons to everything!

Thanks SO much /r/buildapc! I go on /r/buildapc and /r/buildapcsales everyday now just to look at what's new. I wouldn't have been able to do this without you guys.

Turns out it runs XBMC and plays HD content like a champ.  I was a little worried about the P4, but the discrete graphics really runs the show.  XBMC is really amazing, by the way.  Being able to use my Android as an awesome remote is also nice.

I could have got a motherboard for $25, but it was a BTX board and I couldn't find a single BTX-compatible case.  In hindsight it would have been fun to have made an open wood case for one.

Yes, the $15 case + PSU combo terrified me as much as you, and of course the PSU blew out right away.  Oh well.

Just wanted to give you all a quick update on some recent features and functionality I've added to PCPartPicker.

* **Parametric Price Alerts** - These just rolled out literally a few minutes ago.  What they allow you to do is set a price alert on any part category with filters.  Essentially you can set a price alert using any filter settings for the part category views.  Wanted to set a price alert on all 7200RPM 1TB hard drives? Or on all Radeon HD 7970 video cards? How about any RAM modules that are DDR3-1600+, 2x4GB, and manufactured by Corsair or Kingston? Now you can.  Not only that, but these respect your merchant selections, configured tax rates, and local-only deal preferences.
* **Updates to regular price alerts** - Similar to the parametric alerts, standard part price alerts now also reflect your price/merchant preferences as well.
* **Part category filter tweaks** - Now when you view a part category page, the filter items will be grayed out if all of the corresponding parts for them are incompatible with your current selection.  It'll make more sense when you see it, but in a nutshell it should make it faster to filter items when you already have parts picked out.
* **Discussion Forums** - PCPartPicker now has [forums](http://pcpartpicker.com/forums), with voting, threading, and syntax/markdown similar to Reddit.  BuildAPC is fantastic, and I'm not trying to divert any people from here.  However, a growing portion of visitors are not from Reddit and have been requesting this.

I've added several part categories over the last month.  Though these have been posted by others, to recap:

* [Case Fans](http://pcpartpicker.com/parts/case-fan/)
* [Thermal Paste](http://pcpartpicker.com/parts/thermal-paste/)
* [Speakers](http://pcpartpicker.com/parts/speakers/)
* [Wired Network Interface Cards](http://pcpartpicker.com/parts/wired-network-card/)
* [Wi-Fi Network Adapters](http://pcpartpicker.com/parts/wireless-network-card/)

And finally, congratulations to all of the 100K contest winners.  I'll be sending out the 100 shirts and 100 sticker packs over the coming week.  That's probably going to take me some time to get sorted out, so if you won one and don't see it right away just hang tight - it will be on the way shortly.

Cheers, and Happy Building,

Philip

I know what you all are thinking!  This sub-$300 PC has to be a piece of junk..  Let me just start off by saying I wouldn't have been able to get below $300 if it wasn't for finding some deals on /r/hardwareswap and waiting out for some stellar newegg rebate deals...  Free ram with my mobo and Windows 7 through my college sure didn't hurt either.  

That being said, let me tell you my background story!  I have always been a hardcore redditor but had never built a PC before.  Being a subscriber to /r/gaming quickly convinced me that PC gaming is the way to go, especially because I was sick of giving Microsoft my money just to play games online.  So in January I subscribed to a wonderful little subreddit that had a very strong userbase called /r/buildapc..  

After about 3 or 4 months of religiously exploring the depths of /r/buildapc,  I decided I HAD to go with a $1000ish i5-3570k/AMD 7870 build..  No offense to anyone, but this is your cookie cutter /r/buildapc build!  When it came time to actually check out on Newegg, I couldn't do it..  I took a step back and said ""Hey, man..  This is your first PC build, and you're not even sure you have what it takes!  Or if you'll even like PC gaming.""  So here I am getting my feet wet..

After months of research and deal searching here is my build..

A lot of people rag on the FX-4100, but it is actually running quite well and it is handling all the games I am playing.  The HD 7770 is actually quite impressive for what it is, and it is giving me nicer graphics than my Xbox 360 gave me. 

The build was fun, and if I truly enjoy PC gaming, I will for sure be putting together a more serious build in the new future.

Special thanks to /u/legitlegit, /u/bballken &amp; /u/quickgroth for the selling me their parts on /r/hardwareswap.

I have found them to be incredibly useful, and if you are even thinking about overclocking, these posts will take you from start to finish, and you'll probably learn something along the way.  No experience required; the guide covers the basics from front to back, including CPU, GPU, and RAM overclocking.

Unfortunately, there aren't many subscribers on that subreddit, so I would like to post it here to try and increase the exposure, because as I have said before, they are *very* helpful and well written.  Also, the guides are all seperate posts, so I have consolidated them into one thread here, for convience.  Please enjoy, and check out [r/gamingpc](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamingpc) for more stuff like this, along with hardware/pc part reviews and more.  Cheers!

Once you get your HDD you're probably already installing Windows 7 on it, and will feel too troubled to get that SSD for ""a little increase in performance""

Well guys,I'm still fucking drunk from last night, but when I woke up today: I immediately started up my PC then turned on my monitor and just launched chrome. 


I mean, literally. It took less than a few seconds to boot.  I barely have to wait for the processes/services to load up before launching anything. 

The SSD is probably the best upgrade you can make to any system.  Neglecting the SSD in a build is like neglecting your hot girlfriend when she offers you the best blow job in the world but you settle for a fucking fleshlight. EVERYONE has hot girlfriends bro, why the fuck are you still using a fleshlight?!!

**edit:** It's not just boot times/shut down times. SSDs are quiet, and produce little heat since they have no mechanical moving parts. You can drop this sucker and be okay (don't drop your gf pls). SSDs also launch applications faster than any harddisk in any HDD raid configuration because of their random read access. In addition to faster boot times, SSDs load start-up applications much faster: games and applications can be launched pretty much instantaneously. And result! Turning off/on a PC has never been much easier. It's normal to shut down a PC guys and it's deviant to not. Saving energy has never been easier. We're also avoiding more dust build up with a PC that's shut downed.

Plus, you're not supposed to shove blue-rays or music on a SSD: there's no benefit to that. So, typical everyday applications should be stored on the SSD for optimal performance. That being said, 128gb is reasonable enough without all that music and movie junk. You can always push off certain games you're not playing on a standard HDD if it sees little to no benefit with faster load times. For example, Sims 3 would most benefit on a SSD, and open-world games such as WoW. So depending on a game, SSDs do have a big impact... 8GB of memory is not hard to come by at $40 for their performance, why is $80 so much harder to come by?

TLDR; Price / GB = expensive, Price / Performance = Priceless. A typical Windows 7 installation is ~17Gb. You do the rest of the math :)",,False,,t5_2rnve,1350921608.0,,,True,t3_11uh6n,http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/11uh6n/build_suggestion_dont_neglect_getting_an_ssd_for/,

You'll notice that this build is currently lacking 8 SATA ports. Since I'm starting out with 5 drives + 1 OS I don't need the full 16 ports. Some time next year when it's time to add 2 or 3 new drives I'll need to look into a RAID controller that has JBOD support (the RAID actually will not be used). Any 2 port SAS card should work (1 SAS port will connect 4 SATA drives). My initial research shows I should budget $100-$300 for this but I'll need to look into which card when the time comes.

If you are using hot swap bays then maxing your 5.25"" case bays is a must. It took me a while to find a case with at least 9 bays that didn't look terribad. Most cases these days are being made with HDD racks integrated directly into the case underneath 2 to 4 5.25"" bays. This makes finding a top-to bottom bay case an increasing rarity these days. The case I bought was even discontinued.


#**Software**

* Ubuntu 12.04 (Free) for the OS
* FlexRAID ($50) for managing the drives

What's FlexRAID you ask? It's basically a quasi-RAID 5 / 6 in the sense that you add 1 or 2 (or more) extra disks to your array in exchange for parity on your files. You can basically lose as many drives as you have parity drives and still retain 100% of your data. Unlike a traditional RAID, if you happen to lose more drives before rebuilding the parity, the data on the remaining drives remains intact. This means unless your server gets hit by a meteorite you'll never be totally screwed. This is important for me because I won't be building a second array for mirroring. It also does some bonus stuff like emailing me if any problem is detected, which is great for a headless system.

There are a lot of software solutions out there that do similar things (Unraid, Snapraid + some pooling software, not to mention your traditional RAID 5 / 6). If you plan on doing something like this in the future do your own research as there are benefits and drawbacks to any solution.

1344117235.0,432,self.buildapc,xorix,"/r/buildapc, let's talk gaming mice. ",559,127,446,http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/xorix/rbuildapc_lets_talk_gaming_mice/,"I've been on this subreddit for a while, but I haven't seen any good guides to getting a gaming mouse. So here we go. 

There's a lot that goes into making a good mouse, and some things may get confusing. Here's list of some terms that you might come across:

* DPI - Dots per inch - Basically, this describes the sensitivity of your mouse. When you move your mouse, it detects how much you've moved it, and moves the cursor accordingly. The more DPI you have, the less movement is required to move the cursor the same amount. 

* Acceleration - If a mouse has acceleration, it means that as you move the mouse faster, it will move your cursor faster. For example, let's say if I move my move one inch in one second, the cursor will move 500 pixels. With acceleration, if I move my mouse one inch in half a second, the cursor may move 750 pixels. Some people like acceleration, others don't. If your mouse comes with this feature, there is usually a way to enable/disable it.

* Polling Rate/Response time- The polling rate for a mouse is how many times per second it sends information to your computer. A 1000Hz polling rate will send 1000 updates to your computer per second. This means your mouse has a 1ms response time, or it sends one update per millisecond. 

* Lift/Liftoff Distance - This is the distance that your mouse will continue to work when lifted off the surface. Both optical and laser mice use some sort of light to track your movement. When lifted off of a surface, sometimes the sensor can still pick up a signal. The lower your liftoff distance is, the less likely it will affect your mouse movement when picking up and repositioning your mouse.  

What to look for in a gaming mouse:

* High DPI and the ability to switch between different DPI settings - a high DPI allows for quick and precise movement while gaming. The ability to quickly change your DPI settings allow you to be more accurate when you need to be, for example when zooming in with a sniper. For most people, a DPI from 1500-3500 works best. Though, some mice can go up to 5000 DPI or more.

* Customizable buttons - A lot of gaming mice have extra buttons you can program to do whatever you want. Some mice only have one or two buttons, while others may have 10 to 12. 

* Wireless vs. Wired - This almost comes down to personal preference, however, most mice work better when wired. Also there's no need for batteries with a wired mouse. Side note: Unlike keyboards, there isn't any advantage to using a PS/2 mouse over a USB mouse. Most mice today are USB mice. 

* Response Time - Generally, a response time for 1-2ms is good. 4-8ms is perfectly fine for general use, but for gaming, this is frowned upon, as you can't react as fast with longer response times. 

Minor points:

* Profile saving - Some mice can save your settings directly to the mouse for quick access. You may have an FPS setting, an MMO setting, and a general use setting. Having a mouse that can save profiles and easily switch between these is a nice thing to have, so you don't need to open up a program every time you want to change a bunch of settings. 

* Surface - If you're going to be spending $50-100 on a mouse, you want to make sure that it actually works the way you want. Check that mouse will work well with whatever surface you will be using it on, or buy a gaming mouse pad. I've heard good things about the [Steelseries QcK](http://steelseries.com/products/surfaces/steelseries-qck), but that discussion is for another thread. 

* Braided Cable - Most gaming mice today come with a braided cable. This ensures that your cable won't get tangled up. Non-braided cables are usually fine, but are also less durable. 

* Ergonomic Design - This means that the shape of the mouse is designed to fit your palm. The is generally good for palm grippers (see below), while claw and fingertip users won't mind a non-ergonomic mouse as much.

* Laser vs. Optical - There are certain people who swear by laser mice, while there are other who do the same for optical mice. I personally haven't seen much a different between the two. Laser sensors have no light if you pick up the mouse and look at the sensor. Probably the biggest difference between the two. If the mouse has the DPI you want, I wouldn't worry about laser vs. optical. 

So with the plethora of mice on the market, how do you find the one that is right for you? Well, the first step would be to figure out what kind of grip you have. 

Everyone holds their mouse differently. However, there are three main grips seen on the majority of people. [Razer has a good guide to the three grips](http://www.razerzone.com/mouseguide/ergonomic), but I will try to summarize them. 

**-=MOUSE GRIPS=-**

[**PALM GRIP**](http://assets.razerzone.com/peripherals-guide/mouse/images/palmgrip-illus01.jpg)

The palm grip is the most common of the three grips. It entails laying your entire hand on the mouse, with your palm resting on top of the mouse, and the sides being held by the thumb, pinky, and sometimes the ring finger. Palm grippers use the the length of their index and middle finger to press the left and right mouse buttons respectively. The mouse is mostly moved with the arm. Due to this, palm grippers generally have the least amount of stress on their hands.

[**CLAW GRIP**](http://assets.razerzone.com/peripherals-guide/mouse/images/clawgrip.jpg)

The claw grip is similar to the palm grip, however, the user's fingers are arched, and only the fingertips are in contact with the mouse buttons. The base of the mouse is stabilized by being nested the user's palm. This grip usually allows for faster clicking than the palm grip, since you only need to press with the tips of our finger rather than the whole thing. However, this will increase the amount of stress on the hand. With the claw grip, the mouse movement is also majorly with the arm. 

[**FINGERTIP GRIP**](http://assets.razerzone.com/peripherals-guide/mouse/images/fingertip-illus01.jpg)

The fingertip grip is ""the primary grip style for game play"". There are only five contact points on the mouse - the fingertips. This grip generally allows for the quickest movement of the mouse, which makes it ideal for gaming. However, fingertip grippers will find that they have the most amount of stress on their hands compared to the other two grips. With this grip, rather than moving the mouse with the arm, it is pushed with the fingertips.

Now that you know what kind of grip you use, what are some good mice for your grip? Here are some popular gaming mice.

**Price of the mouse may change. I'm going by an average of the retail value and the price at the time of posting.**

127 mm/5.00” x 70 mm/2.76” x 44 mm/1.73”

Probably one of the most popular mice out there. It has an optical max 3500 DPI sensor, two side buttons, and looks amazing. It's on the larger size, and is said to be the best palm grip mouse. It has DPI settings of 450/900/1800/3500 DPI. [~~I don't believe there is software to pick a DPI between two of the settings, which is disappointing.~~](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/xorix/rbuildapc_lets_talk_gaming_mice/c5oaaz9)

**[Logitech G9x](http://www.logitech.com/en-us/mice-pointers/mice/g9x-laser-mouse)** - [$70](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/logitech-mouse-910001152) 

108mm/4.25"" x 73mm/2.87"" × 35mm/1.38""

This is another popular mouse, more suited to those with a claw or fingertip grip. It has seven buttons, and the ability to save setting profiles. The G9x can have DPIs anywhere between 200 and 5700. One feature of the G9x is that it's very customizable. The LEDs on the mouse are color customizable, so you can set a different color for different profiles. The G9x comes with two grips - a precision one and a wide grip one. The dimensions above are for the precision grip, the wide grip makes it 82mm/3.23"" wide. It also comes with weight adjustments, where the user can add up to 28g of weight to the mouse. There are also two scrolling settings - notched and smooth. 

**[Saitek Cyborg R.A.T. 7/R.A.T 9](http://www.cyborggaming.com/prod/rat7.htm)** - [$100](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/saitek-mouse-ccb437080002041)

I couldn't find any dimensions online. 

Did I say the G9x was customizable? It's nothing compared to the R.A.T. 7. With this mouse, you can adjust the length of the mouse, as well as the thumb panel distance. So whether you are a palm or claw gripper, this mouse can fit your hand! You can also adjust the weight - up to five 6g weights can be added. The mouse has 3 profile settings that you can easily  switch between. The R.A.T. 7 has a ""precision aim"" function which changes your DPI at the push of a button. This mouse can have DPI settings of anywhere from 25 to 6400 DPI.

The R.A.T. 9 is just a variation of the 7 that has a wireless option. Though it does cost $15-20 more. 

There is also an [MMO version](http://www.cyborggaming.com/fr/prod/mmo.htm) of the R.A.T. 7.

**[Corsair Vengeance M60](http://www.corsair.com/vengeance-m60-performance-fps-laser-gaming-mouse.html/)** - [$50](http://www.amazon.com/Corsair-Vengeance-Performance-Gaming-CH-9000001-NA/dp/B005QUQP76)

120mm/4.72"" x 80mm/3.15"" x 40mm/1.57""

The M60 is advertised as the best FPS mouse. It has 8 programmable buttons, one of which is called the ""Sniper"" button. This is similar to the R.A.T. 7's precision aim in how this button is meant to lower your current DPI. This mouse has DPI settings anywhere from 100 to 5700 DPI. You can also adjust the response time.

New computer, first build from scratch.

Think it tuned out great. Kinda rushed the cables imo, gonna spend my next day off on those.

Happy with everything (hardware-wise) except the Performance edition SP120's, they are pretty loud. Gonna swap those for Quiet edition ones next week.


Also, gonna sleeve the cables blue in the future.

**Description**

Since I have no idea how to work PcPartPicker [here](https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B2x0QMMiCsAwOHhlNHRLaVhUSEU) is a complete breakdown of prices in Google docs. 
**The CPU and PSU were bought in bundles which included parts I am not using. So I filled in the average price.**


Total price is about $2500. (A few items are missing from the list)

I started out with an [NZXT Technologies Source 210](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005869A7K/ref=s9_simh_gw_p147_d0_i1?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_s=center-2&amp;pf_rd_r=0CE2V50G0VTHNS417KEH&amp;pf_rd_t=101&amp;pf_rd_p=1389517282&amp;pf_rd_i=507846) and cut it to the bare minimum. Everything was done by hand so it's not perfect. Each panel was made of 3 layers, aluminum-&gt;acrylic-&gt;aluminum. Cable management was a complete bitch because of the way I had to power all the led's and the tight space. 

It runs Battlefield 3 maxed out with CPU at ~52C and the GPU's at ~ 42C. At idle everything is 30-35C.

I wanted to add more details but I had to get this done before leaving for college, but I might later on.

1372306394.0,430,self.buildapc,1h5pcx,Anyone want some free 80GB SATA 2 drives? I have over 100.,522,92,548,http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/1h5pcx/anyone_want_some_free_80gb_sata_2_drives_i_have/,"So my job is cycling out old computers, and they donate the computers but can't with the HDs. I can wipe them entirely with DBAN and probably get them to some responsible builders. Clearly they're not top of the line or high capacity, but they might be nice to put an OS onto if you can't afford an SSD, or as a good start for a first build. 

EDIT: Alright now that this has gotten a TON of attention, I have spoken to my bosses. I can take them, thankfully. So there's good news for everyone! But there are a few changes and clarifications I have first.

* Firstly, they are not SSD's. Some people messaged me asking about that and I feel that was my fault for not wording that part clearly enough. They are HDD's, all of them. I merely meant that since they are small they would be good for an OS or the like, as SSD's would, but if you could not afford such. I am sorry for confusion in that regard.
* The drives will need to be wiped. They are used, of course, and still have data on them, including an application that restricts write privileges and wipes all saved data and installations at every boot except for a very small partition. Obviously no one wants that, and a wipe is the only way to truly get rid of it, so I will need a few weeks no matter what to be able to get that off each one with DBAN and putting them one by one in a cradle, **but you will know that you will get one because I will be messaging you in the next few days to let you know.**
* These are also **INTERNAL** drives. There seemed to be a bit of confusion on that as well.
* As for the people suggesting I donate to a charity, I certainly will be giving a portion to them as well. I am in communication with /u/Samuri_Kni already about doing that; however, I did offer to reddit as well, so many of you will be getting them. I will most likely be picking them at random/giving to those who need them, or a combination of both.
* As for the number available, there is some change: **I do still have close to or over 100 of them, however only around 60 are the SATA II drives. The rest are also 80 gigs, but are older. I think only SATA I. If, however, that is not an issue for you, I will still gladly give you one or possibly more, or they may also go to charity.**
* For all those who would like to know the kind exactly, they are **Western Digital WD800JD Caviar SE, Model: WD800JD-75MSA3.** There are also one or two among those that are Seagate equivalents. Also when searching for these, there are SATA I and SATA 3 versions of this drive, but I am fairly certain this is the SATA II model.

I walked into my local BB with a list of computer components for a PC I am building.  I had a pretty good amount of store credit with Best Buy, so I figured I would buy what I could there, and get the rest off of New Egg.  I walked in, wandered around and an employee saw me (he ended up being the manager), and he helped me put together an order with my list, not only that but I was telling him how I was buying some components on New Egg, so he checked New Egg to make sure I was getting competitive prices, and not only that but he made sure I was getting free shipping on anything that wasn't in the store. On top of that he went through my New Egg list and price matched anything they had in stock or could be delivered to me (also free shipping).

I know Best Buy get's a bad rap, and justifiably so in many cases, but I walked out of there feeling like I was taken care of.  I got back to my computer and finished the rest of my order on New Egg, which was just basic peripherals and a PSU.  It was such a good experience that I really feel like I should contact someone in corporate at Best Buy to tell them how good of a job the guy did taking care of me.

If there is a lesson learned, for me, it is that while New Egg and some of the cheaper online options are great, good customer service can go a long way.  Not only that, but I think with the free shipping and price matching Best Buy was the way to go in my case.

I just wanted to share my experience with these two popular retailers in case it helps anyone else.

I recently had to send back two items: one to Amazon, and one to Newegg.  The differences were night and day.

Newegg: I had a defective video card that cost me north of $300 and I started the RMA process.  Newegg offered to sell me a USPS shipping label for $12.  I opted to go ahead and mail it USPS since I would be paying for it anyway, and the nearest UPS store is one hourr round trip from my home.  I came home, upset that I had to pay shipping on a defective item and questioning the whole idea of buying such an expensive item online, which brings me to the second point: you have to wait for them to receive your return before they mail you back a new item.  So, now I have to wait probably two weeks minimum to get the video card I ordered back in December.  I chose to email support from Newegg about this whole deal, and they offered to reimburse shipping.  After about 15 emails back and forth because their automated system breaks if you have to change your account email (the one I had was changed to a forward a couple years ago), they offered to pay return shipping.  Once the RMA is closed.  I still have to wait two weeks to get my video card.

Amazon: My wife ordered a USB hard drive for a friend, who lives across the country from us, and had it shipped to her for Christmas.  Unfortunately, when it got there, it would never detect no matter what cable, port, or pc was used.  I went into my Amazon account, clicked return, and it gave me *free* shipping label, and put a replacement unit into their shipping queue immediately.  End of story. No need to complain or waste any of my time. 

Keep this in mind when you are ordering something big online.  Sometimes Amazon is cheaper, but even when it isn't, it is rarely more than a matter of a couple dollars, and their customer service is leaps and bounds ahead before you ever even have to talk to a person.",,False,,t5_2rnve,False,,,True,t3_16dq74,http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/16dq74/newegg_vs_amazon_my_experience/,

**Edit 3:** After taking into consideration all the suggestions here is an alternative NAS only build. I may still go the combo route until I save enough for a separate HTPC build. I used a case/psu combo to keep prices about the same.

**Edit 4:** I've changed my mind a lot about what parts to use since I got a lot of wonderful comments and suggestions. **This is a project for the future. This is not by any means the final build.**  I'll probably wait until the better Richland APUs come out in a few months since they support FM2. I'm currently thinking of using Ubuntu with XBMC to fulfill both needs properly. Got some flak about why I'm using a cpu cooler on a NAS/HTPC. It's just for temp controls and something quieter than stock. Got some useful info on why I shouldn't go with that particular cpu and decided to stick with APUs. I got a relatively expensive case because it supports 8 drive bays and 2 200mm fans. I want 200mm fans since they are quieter than your typical 120/140mm.

Sorry about that.

Hey guys, have a seat. No need to play musical chairs, just sit down wherever. Okay, everyone listening?

Over the past week or so, there has been a massive influx of submissions and comments relating to piracy, specifically when it comes to pirating Windows. Not only have we been removing every one of these kinds of posts that we have seen, but it has gotten bad enough where I had to ban a user today for repeatedly doing this while completely disregarding and ignoring every one of our warnings.

Now, I understand that some of you guys don't want to shell out $100 for an operating system (perhaps it's too constraining on your budget) or simply don't care about having legitimately-acquired software. Your opinion is your opinion, and I am not the one to change that. This subreddit just isn't the place to discuss pirating methods for the sake of us (and in addition, Reddit itself) not facing legal action for that particular content being posted here, and this is a decision that all of us (the moderators) made collectively. So, again setting this in stone...

**Advocating piracy or discussing how to pirate software of any kind is not allowed here. If you do it, we will find you, and we will ~~kill you~~ remove your post accordingly as well as warn you to stop it. I did not just make a Taken reference in the previous sentence. Repeat offenders will face further action, including but not limited to being subjected to the almighty banhammer.**

Now, I'm not saying that piracy in itself is an inappropriate topic to discuss here, such as if there's an article that's posted regarding it somehow and that's what the discussion is about in the comments. It's the encouraging of it through various means that us moderators have an issue with.

Please upvote this post so it gains exposure for everyone to see; I will not gain any karma because it is a self-post. Thanks! Now move along and go burn your money on all those Steam games that are on sale!

I've noticed when people are comparing components (specifically GPUs), they will compare item X (overlocked) to item Z (reference). Why I find this aggravating is that they're comparing an overclocked item to a non-overclocked item. What's to stop you from overclocking item Z as well? 

Let me give you an example (note: this may not be 100% accurate, this is just an example): 

- ""if you get a 670 and overclock it, then it will be faster than a 7970."" 

I would down vote this. 

Why? Well, If you suggest overclocking the 670, what's to stop you from overclocking the 7970 and making it faster than the 670? 

This is not a bias post nor a post comparing the 670 to the 7970. I'm just getting tired of the people suggesting overclocking a certain card then comparing it to a non-overlcocked alternative then claiming it will be ""faster"". 

Instead of leaning towards one gpu and claiming that if you overclock it, it will  be faster than the competition's alternative, let's compare either reference clocks to reference clocks, or the same overclock on both cards. 

I hope people will stop posting such shitty advice to others just because they're a fanboy of either AMD or Nvidia. Again, I've seen this happen for both teams, and I'm not bias towards one or pointing my finger at one. 

It's one thing if you mention that 'if' you overclock a card, then it 'may'  be faster than another, but it's another thing recommending a card by doing that. If you're recommending a card, please compare the same OC clocks or compare the reference clocks. 

Hopefully others have seen the same. Just something I thought worth noting to the community.

Ideally, it should be powerful enough to run all current games on Steam at 1080p with (at least) mid specs at 60fps. As far as the actual case of the tower goes, the smaller the better. It must have HDMI-out (for both video and audio - one cable). It should probably have bluetooth, for wireless keyboards/mice/controllers.

I was going to get started putting stuff together on Newegg a few minutes ago, but I figured /r/buildapc would not only be better than me at designing the tower, but they'd probably have a lot of fun doing it, too.

I'm still going to make my attempt and submit it in the comments below, but I'm much more interested in what you guys can make.

I'm not entirely sure that this is the right subreddit, but buildabattlestation appears to be completely unused.

A bit of back story:

My partner and I have almost finished our renovation of the house. The one room we've left to sort is ""the study"". This room is about a decent sized double bedroom, in the basement. This is where you guys come in, to help get the best bang for buck on a few machines, and peripherals!

As part of the renovation, we've laid CAT6 behind the walls throughout the house. EVERY plug socket in the house has an RJ45 port, all terminating in gigabit switch in the cupboard under the stairs. There's extra ports in the basement ""battlestation"" room.

I have, from work, an old Thecus iSCSI box with 8TB of storage. I believe it can also be set up as a simple NAS.


The machines I'd like to build:

Two (his and hers) gaming machines, to replace our aging ones. Each capable of playing the latest games on full settings. We'd each like tripple 1440p monitors. (My machine will also be used for coding. Hers will also be used for CAD work)

We need all 6 of the 1440p monitors to come out of this budget.

We'd like a 60"" TV for the battlestation room too. (Open to the idea of a projector too)

One media server (connected to the thecus?) to put in the cupboard under the stairs.

We already have 3 mini ITX AMD APU builds running XBMCBUNTU. At present we just cart the media round on an external USB drive. We'd like to use the new CAT6 wiring, and a media server to have the living room TV, battlestaitonroom TV and bedroom TV all able to stream from a central server.

Our renovations came in under budget, so we have ~£12k (UK GBP) to play with.

We'll follow up with a picture tour of the new room once all is in place! It should look pretty cool, I'm building a wall display unit for our comic collection, my partner is making stencils for artwork to put on the walls. I'm really excited about this project! Any help greatly appreciated!!

EDIT: Thank you for the amazing response! Some great discussion going on!

SECOND EDIT: To clear up the confusion if there's any. The TV is going to be in the battlestation room, in front of the sofa and armchairs. It's purpose will be for movies, live streams (starcraft/dota/lol) and games for our PS3, 360, wii &amp; wii U. It will be hooked up to an existing XBMCBUNTU build, along with the consoles.",,False,,t5_2rnve,1364691771.0,,,True,t3_1bblbf,http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/1bblbf/an_big_project_with_a_big_budget_12k/,

I want to make (and have already made a working prototype) a website where you can set a budget and a usage and a build will be found for your needs. Obviously it will be generalized and will still need some work but would be a better alternative. It would offer explanation as to why each part was chosen underneath a build with pricing information.

I need ideas as to features you would like to see in it, or whether it is a terrible idea to begin with. Thanks in advance for any feedback.

Prices don't reflect what I actually paid for the parts as I acquired them over the course of a month or so. Before someone says something about the motherboard choice, it was actually a gift so I wasn't going to ask the person, ""Hey, where's my x79 board or the receipt so I can return it and get something else?""

The plan to water cool was pretty spur of the moment and more of a hobby decision than to squeeze every bit of performance out of the computer. I mean, my current GPU isn't running under water as my reference 7970 died and I couldn't get another one so I was given a Dual-x model.

I am an avid enthusiast and build systems for a living, I've been wanting to write this up for a while now and thought today's just as good as any.
To clarify, this post is for the average gamer who is running a one monitor setup and possibly one other monitor for seperate tasks.

I've been building my own and selling custom PC builds since I was 15 years old, As of last month, I'm 26, I know I'm not the most experienced out of all the reddit demigods on here but I have some good advice I hope can help some people.

I would like to offer a little bit of experienced perspective on the amount of money the average redditor and gamer needs to spend to get the most out of their games.          
Many websites on the net will tell you the BEST of each category, do reviews of all kinds and give you mind boggling numbers that not many people can understand.              
 
This sort of review system leads people down the garden path of ""Ultimate Power!""
I am a huge nerd, I spend all my free time on my PC, playing the latest games, writing, watching movies, browsing the net, everything, you won't meet many people that spend more time on their PCs then I do.       
 
I have been researching and studying hardware professionally for 10 years and I always stay totally informed on all components. 
          
**CPU**
As a rule, you will never need the best parts on the market to get the most out of what you want to play.    
For instance, Many gaming websites (Who shall remain nameless) will have a ""recommended buy"" award on the top end intel i7 range, these can max out at $1000 or more, while for gaming a $220 i5 2500k is more then you could need.
One of the most important components, the CPU is the brains and brawn of your system and buying the right part will set you in good sted as you chose the rest of your parts.
Right now the i5 2500K is the best CPU you can buy for your money hands down, you'll notice almost every custom build in this subreddit includes it and every major review and engineering website worth its salt uses it in their gaming builds.
Scaling up to an i7 will net you very little gaming performance improvement, under generally gaming stress a $800 i7 can net you less then 10 FPS improvement over the i5.
[For more indepth but easily understandable reading](http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/gaming-cpu-review-overclock,3106.html)

**GPU**
The same goes for Graphics cards, while triple GTX590s will give you good Frame rates across 3 24inch monitors, if, like me, you like to have one monitor for gaming and maybe one other for browsing the net or watching TV while gaming, then one graphics card can more then meet your requirments and with technology far outpacing the average gaming design, you can buy a $230 nVidia GTX 560 Ti that, price vs performance will put most super high end cards to shame and will max Battlefield 3 and Skyrim on a 1080p monitor without batting an eye lid.      
[Further reading](http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/gaming-graphics-card-review,3107-4.html)    

Especially don't listen to minimum system requirements, you ever notice when you launch a game it generally has an ATI or nVidia logo in the intro?
This is an advertisement and support scheme that goes both ways for each company, nVidia optimise their cards for certain games to garner players who support that brand and the games developers tell you you have GOT to have the latest series of GPUs to run their game. This is rubbish.
This is evidenced by the fact that I myself have maxed Battlefield 3 on a test Gigabyte 6850 OC on a 1080 screen and gotten consistant 40+ FPS (more then playable) when I was told the system wouldnt be able to handle medium settings.       

**RAM** 
RAM is something you wont have to think to much about, the price of good quality RAM these days is inconsequential, I currently recommend Corsair Vengeance line for the quality of the RAM and the awesomely sexy heat sink.
My only major recommendation is DDR3 all the way, the responsiveness when alt tabbing out of game with a DDR3 system is something worth fighting a war over.

**Motherboard**
In some estimations, the motherboard is the most important choice you'll make, right now, the motherboards for the Intel range of CPU seem to have the better feature sets for your average gamer, I personally look for at least USB 3.0 support, Sata 3 and optical audio out, along with the chipset and bios types, but that's a discussion for another thread, basically if you buy one of the well established brands (A very heated topic as all brand loyalty wars are) Gigabyte, Asus, Asrock, Acer, You're going to get what you need, if you want to squeeze every ounce of performance out of your machine the motherboard can be your most important choice but for the type of gamer this article is intended for, choose a good manufacturer for your chipset and remember that in PC building almost more then anywhere else, you pay for what you get, aim to pay between $130 and $200 and you should get a great piece of hardware on which to build your system.

The other peripherals have been thoroughly covered in other articles and most of the time are pretty straight forward purchases, I hope this article can help one or two people make the right choice in system building, if like me, you usually use your PC for gaming.
I apologise in advance if a similar post has already been made, while I read the subreddit every day, I probably miss things and I haven't always been a member.

My last thought is that there is nothing more satisfying then building a powerful system and knowing you didnt blow huge amounts of money on it for little result, theres nothing worse then spending big dollars and getting similar results to your friend who spent a third of what you did. 

Edit: I hadn't included PSU or Case or HDDs because other people have covered this topic quite a bit but I'll add sections for them, taking in advice in the comments, later on today, thanks for all the support guys! It's really inspiring!

I myself am no expert when it comes to monitors or running a subreddit. The only reason I asked for ownership of /r/monitors is because the subreddit is basically dead, and there are TONS of monitor related questions here, and over at /r/gamingpc.

Feel free to share thoughts and opinions on the matter at hand. I personally feel /r/monitors could become a very useful tool in the future for the community. 

By the way, I'm not looking to have the subreddit added to buildapc's sidebar. I know subreddits must meet a certain criteria before even being considered. 

Edit: Thank you guys for upvoting for visibility. Hopefully we can get someone on board that knows their stuff when it comes to monitors. 

Edit 2: Our current Moderators are /u/Alfaa123, /u/Favorablestream, /u/Kinaestheticsz, and /u/TactFully. 

Edit 3: I just wanted to say thanks again for all the useful information you guys have provided! I'm really looking forward to seeing the sub grow, and seeing all of your monitor related questions answered.

 We should have some guides up in the next few days courtesy of our new moderators, but for the time being if you would like to post guides of your own on monitors feel free to head on over.

3 times I've ordered from this company and all 3 have been slower and more difficult than with any other retailer.

First time the package was almost destroyed when it arrived. I chalked it up to damage during shipping, I couldn't blame that on them affirmatively.

The second time they canceled my order without any explanation. Didn't even email me to say my order was canceled. I was sitting here wondering where my hard drive was and noticed a refund on my bank account. Called them up and they told me that they were out of stock and the drive had been discontinued. When I asked why their site said they were in stock at the time of my order, and why it still said in stock during my phone call with them, the woman had no answer.

This time I ordered a case and CPU from them. It took them 3 times longer than any other place I ordered parts from to ship out my order, and when it finally does ship I see that my case is on back order. Check the site and OF COURSE it says in stock ""only a few left order now!"". Email support, got some tired excuse about it being out of stock but expecting shipment tomorrow. Couldn't explain why their site says it's in stock. Denied my request for an upgrade to overnight since they lied (again).

So a word to the wise. If NCIX says an item is in stock on their site, they may very well be lying. You can also bet your ass they charge you for the item even if they don't have it.

**Edit:** Since I'm about giving credit /u/Chris-NCIX replied to this post and is a Customer Care Manager with NCIX Canada. He asked that I email with any information I had. After doing so he messaged me back within a couple of hours and informed me he's investigating the issue. Since he's in Canada he can't personally investigate the issue but has calls scheduled for today to figure out my issue. I'm also assuming he plans to ask why their US branch has such horrible customer satisfaction.

Again this is only to the US branch. From the replied here the home branch in Canada has raving reviews. I don't think I've seen a single bad comment about the home branch. The US branch however appears that 75% of us have had some issue with them in the past.

He has said that any person who's had bad experiences with the US branch is encouraged to email him at ckinsman@ncix.com.

I'll update again when I hear back from him.


**Edit 2:**Chris just called me and covered a lot of details (And if he's reading this I welcome his corrections in the event I miss understood). He explained how the US branch recently went through a site upgrade around Christmas and how the stock tracking feature of the site has been bugged. There was a project to repair that bug but it was forgotten. He took 100% of the blame for the issue, that he and developers on his staff will be working to implement working inventory tracking by Thursday, and proceeded to explain how ordering SHOULD take place but hasn't. He explained that he spoke with the rep I dealt with and plans to give that rep more authority to compensate customers down the line. He did say that the rep should have explained why their site says in stock when the product isn't. He also pulled the owner of the company in and directed him to this thread. Also ALSO he remembered my email from a previous order and asked about a problem that I didn't even mention in this thread. Talk about service.

tl:dr The US site is bugged and Chris will be working to resolve the inventory tracking feature and improve shipment estimates by Thursday. There was a lot of explaining of the situation and it's clear that Chris loves his job, company, and bacon. My case shipped this afternoon and he said he will be making it up to me once the dust settles with fixing this bug. Also their US branch is fairly new so shipping channels have some room for improvement which he will also be working on.",,False,,t5_2rnve,1364002953.0,,,True,t3_1aqq3x,http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/1aqq3x/i_am_done_purchasing_from_ncix/,

I am really impressed with XBMCbuntu Eden. The controller was tricky to set up, but it looks like most of the common gamepad controllers are pre-configured (Xbox 360 wireless for Windows, PS3, Logitech's most common one).

I also had to ""sudo apt-get install pusleaudio"" and reboot, then sound started working. After modifying the workgroup name the server was visible, and it grabbed all my movies and had that slick format output. 

I'm very impressed at how well it runs on some low end hardware, and how dang useful XBMC is. It was much easier to setup than I anticipated!

I started it as a ""what the hell"" project, and ended up really liking XBMC. With an Xbox 360 controller and more mainstream audio it would have been no configure.

So I went and did it!

Here's a nice list of parts for anyone who'd like to build their own AIO. It is just a bit more complicated to do than your standard desktop. Requires a few more specific bios settings, more part compatibility issues and some cables that may appear weird to someone who hasn't opened up a laptop. That said, it's totally doable.

I took a risk on the Chassis (the Loop LP2150) because there was very little information out there on it. I'm happy to report that it went much better than expected. Not only is the panel nice, the case is beautiful (as you'll see below), it's reasonably priced, stable on it's stand, and it's got a real glass screen. I didn't order it from Amazon though, I got mine through [Provantage.](http://www.provantage.com/intel-cap08loopaio~7ITE911K.htm). It has an integrated webcam, mic, speakers, screen (duh) just like you're average off the shelf AIO.
 This one also came with the flat heatsink, power supply (150watt brick) and wireless antenna (not the card) pre installed. Multiple other cables were conveniently pre-installed (albeit not plugged in obviously). So if you're planning on doing it yourself this is a great AIO chassis to start with. There are certainly others out there but few that come so equipped.

**2) They perform about the same at stock clocks**

http://www.anandtech.com/bench/Product/523?vs=551

---

**3) The i7-3820 overclocks better than the i7-3770k**

[And don't tell me that the i7-3820 can't be overclocked](http://benchmarkreviews.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=874&amp;Itemid=63&amp;limit=1&amp;limitstart=14) because it doesn't have a 'K'. The lack of a K just means that the processor has a capped multiplier.

The i7 3770K gets really hot when overclocked compared to the previous SB or SB-E chips due to the air gap introduced by ivybridge by Intel.

---

**4) Up to 40 PCIe lanes for dual GPUs**

This is a big one. In fact, this is the one you buy an i7 for for gaming in the first place!

z77 has a maximum of 16 PCIe lanes. This means if you get dual cards you are limited to x8/x8. Contrary to popular belief, this DOES make a difference, especially in certain situations. Also it leaves your options open for tri-fire too! Try that on z77 and see how you get on :D

[Bench for dual cards x8/x8 vs x16/x16 at high res](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/164qx0/psa_i73820_the_x79_chipset_and_gaming/c7sq49p)

---

**5) Quad Channel RAM**

Unlikely to give you any real world performance benefit, but it comes as a bonus!

---

**6) Ivybridge-E is rumored to be on the 2011 socket for upgrades**

So don't tell me 2011 is a dead socket either. 1155 is more dead than it if you are going to make that accusation

---

Discussion is welcome, as well as if I have stumbled anywhere.

**TL;DR Recommend the i7-3820, not the i7-3770k**

---

**Other things to note from the discussions below:**

* For certain specific applications the i7-3770k outperforms the i7-3820. Be sure to check benchmarks if you have special requirements

* The i7-3820 uses more power than the i7-3770k. This shrinks into insignificance with power hungry GPUs but is worth considering

* The benefits of the increased bandwidth for dual card setups is reduced at lower resolutions",,False,,t5_2rnve,1358784919.0,,,True,t3_164qx0,http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/164qx0/psa_i73820_the_x79_chipset_and_gaming/,

I'm excited that I can finally give something back to the community, as you all helped me tremendously when putting together my build. After installing Windows and just a few programs to my 64GB Crucial M4 SSD, I noticed that I only had about 10GB left on it. I knew that something must have been wrong so I checked out the drive in [SpaceSniffer](http://www.uderzo.it/main_products/space_sniffer/download.html) (great tool btw).

Two huge files, pagefile.sys and hiberfil.sys, were taking up 16 and 12 GB respectively. I checked out what each of them were and here's what I found out.

Pagefile.sys is basically a section of your harddrive that can be utilized if you run out of RAM and it is the size of your RAM as well. Wow, 16GB of RAM on my computer meant that a quarter of my precious SSD space is gone. Fortunately, you can move where pagefile.sys is stored and free up that space. [Here](http://ask-leo.com/what_is_pagefilesys_and_can_i_move_it.html) is how you do it.

Hiberfil.sys is a section of your boot drive that allows your computer to hibernate. Basically, in hibernation mode, your RAM is copied over to your boot drive so that your computer can completely power off and when you turn it back on you can start from where you were before. Now I am not aware of a way to move this to a different drive, however if you disable the feature you can free that space entirely. I've never used hibernation mode before and frankly I don't feel its worth the 12GB of RAM it was using. [Here](http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/15140/what-is-hiberfil.sys-and-how-do-i-delete-it/) is how to disable hibernation and free that space up.

So that's it, I went from 10GB to 38.4GB of free space on my SSD and I can breathe easy now.

However, for a while, it appeared to me (purely anecdotally) that the use of Extreme4 motherboards was diminishing. However, in the past little while, I've been seeing more of them pop up in *approved* Build Ready posts and in Build Complete posts. That's why I feel the need to reiterate why you shouldn't get one.

The Extreme4 costs $125 at Microcenter or **$135** online. While this may seem like a good deal, it brings with it a plethora of issues:

- **Low-quality** VRM including low-quality D-PAK MOSFETs, which have a tendency to **overheat** and wear out with high overvolts
- **Lies** by claiming to have a digital VRM which is **actually analog**
- **Under-reports voltage**, which can be very **dangerous** for your CPU
- **4+1** true PWM phases

It may still be a good deal if you get it very cheap, but at regular pricing, these are the two main alternatives:

- [**Biostar TZ77XE3**](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/biostar-motherboard-tz77xe3), **better analog VRM** for **$110**
- [**Gigabyte GA-Z77X-UD3H**](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/gigabyte-motherboard-gaz77xud3h), **incredible *digital* VRM** for **$125**, has even been used to [overclock to **7.03 GHz**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnDOPYgrP2s) on LN2

There is really no reason to get an Extreme4, considering that you can get a better motherboard for the same price **or less**.

I've been on this sub for a few months and I spend most of my Reddit time on here helping you guys out with your computers. When you're looking for advice or help there's a few things you need to ensure you include in your post so that we can help you the best we can.

Before you make your post please read our FAQ's and sidebar. If you haven't got any parts picked out then head over to /r/buildapcforme before posting. If you do have a build you want to share then please use [PcPartPicker](http://pcpartpicker.com/) and use the Reddit markup section to copy/paste your build into your text post.

Here's a few points you should cover in your post:

• What is the purpose of your computer? Any informtion on how you use your computer and what you plan to do with it will help us pick parts specificity for your needs.

• What is your budget? Are tax and shipping included?

• What country do you live in? If the U.S, please tell us the state and city if possible. This will make sure the prices of parts are adjusted for your area.

• When do you plan on building/buying the PC?

• Do you prefer to get all your parts from one place? Some people like to order all their parts from one place because it's easier.

• Are you able to get parts from a Microcenter? Microcenter have some pretty good deals so if it's possible to pick some parts up from one of their shops that's great.

• What exact parts do you need for that budget? CPU, RAM, case, monitor etc. The word ""Everything"" is not a valid answer. Please list out all the parts you'll need.

• Do you already have a legit and reusable/transferable OS key/license? If yes, what OS? Is it 32bit or 64bit?

• What is the max resolution of your monitor? What size is it?

• Do you plan on overclocking? If you do plan on overclocking then will it be a light boost or are you looking to get the most possible performance out of your chip?

• What future upgrades do you plan on making? Do you plan to add another GPU in for SLI or maybe add water cooling in eventually?

• If you have already chosen parts then why have you chosen them? Justify your decision so we don't have to guess.

• Do you have any personal preferences? It could be that you prefer intel over AMD or you like Corsair cases. Let us know. 

• What features do you need in a motherboard? RAID? Firewire? Crossfire or SLI support? USB 3.0? SATA 6Gb/s? eSATA? Onboard video (as a backup or main GPU)? UEFI? etc.

Mentioning all these things in your [Build Ready], [Build Help], or any other post will not only help us pick parts for you but it will help you get the most out of your PC.

If you have any points to add to the list that I have missed then feel free to mention them in the comments and I'll add them in.

So over the past couple of months I have been working on my PC, buying new parts here and there and doing modifications on my free time. I live at home with my Dad and he was thrilled to see me doing so much handy work and was always willing to help with painting, cutting, and any work that involved me using his work bench. I think I have even convinced him to let me build him his next computer. But anyways, I hinted at him a month ago that I could really use a nice quiet 200mm fan for exhaust on the top of HAF 912, except I didn't specify what size of fan I just said ""fan"" so he got me a 140mm Xigmatek Crystal Fan. It's a great fan, but I have no where to put it on my case so I told him that I would have to return it.

Upon looking at his account to do a return through Newegg, I noticed that he had bought it literally on the day I hinted my gift to him, November 11th. This was over 30 days go and the day for returns on Xigmatek fans is exactly 30 days so I just said oh well and thanked him for the gift anyways.

My father is very persistent when it comes to customer service stuff like this so later he called Newegg and explained the situation to a Newegg rep over the phone.

With no fight, no demanding of a refund, and no redirection of calls, the Newegg rep told us that he would re credit the account for the price of the fan, but told us to not even bother sending the fan back. Maybe this happens at other stores too, but I have never seen such amazing customer service personally form an online site like I have seen from Newegg.

**Highlights:**

At $666 you get a devilishly delightful low-cost OC machine with:

A Solid PSU (much better than Corsair CX)

Unlocked quad core CPU that should easily reach 4,3-4,4Ghz on air.

Powerful and quiet CPU cooler for overclocking.

Great case.

1TB HDD.

Powerful graphics card (Should be roughly what the CPU can handle when overclocked to at least 4GHz).

Fast 8GB DDR3 memory

Mostly black/silver components making for a clean-looking build.

**Includes 4 free games** (AMD promotion - if you don't get a game bundle with at least 3 games, contact AMD)

___

If you're into overclocking, this could quite possibly be one of the best-value gaming setups.

1367521420.0,355,self.buildapc,1dkgwt,"New Features: Custom Part Prices, Marking Parts As Purchased, and ""Inventory""",404,49,59,http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/1dkgwt/new_features_custom_part_prices_marking_parts_as/,"Hi /r/buildapc,

I'm happy to announce a few more features added to PCPartPicker that allow you to enter custom part prices, mark parts as purchased, and keep inventory of the parts you own.

When adding parts to your part list, you can customize the price information displayed by clicking on the arrow button next to the price.  [(screenshot)](http://pcpartpicker.com/static/forever/images/blog/custom_part_price_divit.png)

Clicking on the custom price button pulls up the following dialog: [(screenshot)](http://pcpartpicker.com/static/forever/images/blog/custom_part_price_dialog.png)

For each part, you can:

* Choose the cheapest available price
* Override to show price from a specific retailer
* Import purchase price from your inventory
* Enter your own purchase price manually, and optionally add it to your inventory

User inventory is a ""new"" feature that lets you track what parts you already own.  I've been using it internally for almost a year now, and there was a while where I inadvertently leaked the functionality out to the public.  I didn't release it because I was still working out usability quirks and inconsistencies, but I think I've got that ironed out now.

If you're not familiar with the inventory page though, it is similar to ""favorite parts"", except that you can also enter the purchase price for each item.  You can also view current prices, and add them to your part list directly from the inventory page.  When adding from your inventory, it will automatically apply your purchase price for that part.

In addition to all of this, saved and completed builds will also retain the custom part price information.  If you want to show how much you paid for your completed build instead of current prices, just edit your part list to include the custom pricing and save back into your completed build.

Also, if you have custom prices assigned to parts in your partlist, they will show up in your Reddit markup too.  So you don't have to always say ""I already own X, or paid Y for this instead"", etc.

Cheers, and Happy Building,

Philip (PCPartPicker)

The above covers the build except the RAID specs; the hard drives will be run in RAID 60.

I know for a lot of people that much space is overkill, however for me it is not. I have around 10TB right now on my old NAS and I download about 1TB a month, depending on the month.

Some reasons for the parts:

* Server 2012 Datacenter: Free from my MSDN account
* WD SAS Drives: I've always had good luck with WD drives, we use the 2TB versions at work with no problems, and the RED series isn't up to 4TB yet.

If I told someone I needed a car that can fit 5 people, and I had a hard budget of $16,000, suggesting a new Mustang is silly, even though I get ""way more performance for only slightly more $.""

Similarly, if I told someone I wanted a car that could go 300 mph, suggesting a Mustang because you can go 162 mph and only costs $22,000 would be ridiculous.  Sure, my request for a car that can go 300 is odd, but telling me why a 162 mph/$22,000 car is a much better value doesn't help.

Rationale:

* CPU - No Microcenters near me, would have been 200 dollars more to get an x79 CPU and socket. Based on some research (I'll just cite [this](http://www.techpowerup.com/reviews/Intel/Ivy_Bridge_PCI-Express_Scaling/)) I didn't find it worth it. I could have done it to future proof, but, meh. Primarily for gaming so didn't need Hyper Threading on the i7.
* CPU Cooler - Wanted to go air, wanted the Noctua radiator design, despise the Noctua fan colors. replaced them with some Corsair SP HP fans (high static pressure) with a little engineering and hey, looks great with no loss of performance.
* Motherboard - I really liked the features (Built in wifi + bluetooth!), bells, and whistles of this mobo. I like the fact it uses mil spec components and comes with a little certificate from the person who burn tested it 24 hours before shipping. Yellow bits are completely hidden by the engine block and jet engines (video cards) so hey, no big.
* Memory - 8 gigs of memory for gaming. Black. Low profile to fit under the engine block. Done.
* Storage: Had a 2TB media drive, went with the standard 128gb Samsung 840 Pro. Not much to say.
* Video Card: Had good luck with XFX in the past, these were marked down when I got them, came with a bunch of games (although any 7970 would have). Matched the build. Lifetime warranty. Noticed a bit after I received them that bad reviews started to flood in on Newegg (did not get them from Newegg, but were 4 eggs when I got them). Not sure if Newegg got a bad batch or cards are crappy. Guess I'll find out and see if XFX is still all about it's lifetime warranty. Myself - I've had no issues, love these things.
* Case - Fractal R4. I love minimal, solidly build cases.
* Power Supply - Went with a gold standard brand. Got some individually sleeved cables from ModDIY.com instead of doing it myself. because the stock ones are ugly as hell and because in the equation of my life time &gt; money. Wanted customs because with extensions you still have the mess coming out of the power supply, and also I could specify 3 6 pin PCI-E cables (2 for the video cards, 1 for the extra PCI-E power on my mobo) and 2 8 pin PCI-E cables without having to worry about hiding the jumpers.
* OS: Windows 8 + Startisback. Glory.
* Monitor: Monoprice 30"" IPS. I originally got a 24"" 1080p 120hz monitor. I realized that 120hz meant nothing to me. Returned it, did some looking around, decided to jump in and get this bad boy. I regret nothing.
* Keyboard: Cooler Master Storm Quickfire Rapid, Cherry reds. Contrary to the terrible stock images on newegg or amazon, the cooler master branding is nowhere to be seen on this keyboard. Nice, clean.
* Other: Bose speakers my dad no longer wanted, Turtle Beach PX5 headset as a Christmas gift from the wife, Logitech G500 from my last build, and HP Laserjet 1200 printer. The best fucking printer this world has or will ever see.

Hope you enjoyed my build.

Edit: I did get some extensions - I got a 3 to 1 fan extension (red) for the front fans and the HD audio from the front panel extension (Also red, that thing is waaay too short on the R4). Bitfenix Alchemy extensions from FrozenCPU.com.

Since joining BAPC, I’ve noticed that the same questions get asked and answered a lot so it would be helpful to have something akin to a FAQ. Further, I haven’t found a “start here” post for newcomers to BAPC. My goal of this post to hopefully fulfill those two needs and help other redditors build their first computer (and I treasure that glorious self-post karma).

**Edit:** I wrote this post a year ago, so some of the links may be slightly out-of-date. I've done my best to link to things that do not make specific tech recommendations, so I feel pretty confident that everything in here will be good advice, if a little old. If you see something that needs to be changed, just let me know.

I am only an amateur nerd, so feel free to correct me as you see fit, and if any of the links are broken, please let me know.

P.S. Articles with specific tech recommendations will become more and more outdated as time wears on so be weary of trusting a 3 month old part recommendation.

###Basics

* **This process really isn’t as hard as it seems.** You need to spend a good amount of time researching and learning, but once you have your components picked out, actually assembling everything is really easy. I know this whole thing can seem daunting, but I promise you that if I can do it, you can do it.

* Should I build [my own computer?](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/dmp2j/is_it_cheaper_to_build_my_own_desktop/)

* **How much do I need to spend?** It depends on the purpose of your build. If you just want to play the current crop of games at max settings on a single monitor, you don't need to spend more than probably $800-$1,000. In fact, you can make a really powerful machine for $600 that will play most games on really high settings. If you need a really powerful video editing station, you'll need to spend more, but seriously, $1,000 will get you a sick rig. Furthermore, future proofing is a [waste of money]( http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/diqq9/your_thoughts_on_future_proofing/
). 

* What each [computer part]( http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/dy5bs/looking_to_build_a_gaming_desktop_but_have_no/) does.

* [Acronym List.](http://www.overclock.net/t/6410/overclocking-acronyms-for-dummies)

* What [motherboard (mobo) specs](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/cw8ms/what_do_the_specifications_of_a_motherboard_mean/) mean. Another great post on [understanding mobos](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/m30sm/understanding_motherboards/).

* **Use the sidebar.** Tons of great resources in there.

###Other FAQ’s

* **Do I need liquid cooling?** Only if you are planning on heavily overclocking should you consider liquid cooling. It is mostly just a huge pain the ass, and is not worth the effort unless you plan on running extremely hot. If you’re a beginner, don’t waste your time. If you’re not planning on OCing, stock cooling is basically A-OK. [Source 1]( http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/cyyv4/starting_to_plan_to_build_my_first_pc_my_first/). [Source 2.](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/d0wpy/does_anyone_actually_use_a_liquid_cooling_system/)

* **What about a gaming laptop?** There are [differing opinions]( 
http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/ct0p6/thinking_about_buying_a_gaming_laptop_my_opinion/), but the consensus seems to be that you should buy a cheap netbook and use the rest on a decent desktop. 

* **How do I filter dust?** Look in [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/search?q=dust&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance) for the various threads on the subject.

I didn't want to remove the existing heatsink for fear of complete screwing up the card, so I awkwardly secured the waterblock on top, but it worked!

[Picture](http://i.imgur.com/ApTgXqI.jpg)

I bent paperclips and hooked them under the screws. It actually hold it in place very well. That bubble will end up in the reservoir when I turn it on. 

[A different angle](http://i.imgur.com/jCz1k4C.jpg). As you can see, I used a flat piece of metal underneath to act as a shim because the tubing prevented the whole waterblock from laying flat on the copper heat pipes.

I originally had the waterblock more towards the back of the computer. When it was like that I cut holes in the bottom plate of the laptop and it fit on well and I was able to screw it on. After moving back the waterblock, the holes I cut don't work as well. I don't know if I'll get around to fixing it, as I don't mind using my computer without the bottom plate. I never move my laptop and it's practically a permanent fixture on my desk anyway. [Here's a picture](http://i.imgur.com/QApvNqO.jpg) with the bottom plate on the way it is now. It looks really bad. However, with it off, it lays flat and it still suspended off the surface of the laptop cooler underneath. [Here's a picture](http://i.imgur.com/36RXuet.jpg) of the the back of the computer right side up.

From the waterblock, the [line goes to pump and radiator](http://i.imgur.com/MPwaTnK.jpg), which includes a [small reservoir](http://i.imgur.com/SrvpZMG.jpg) on top.

[Here's a closer view](http://i.imgur.com/RiXXQhE.jpg) of the pump, radiator/reservoir, and fan.

It's pretty [messy looking](http://i.imgur.com/gJJqrbs.jpg), but it's functional and holds together well.

Also, because it is a mixed metal loop, I am using PrimoChill computer water cooling liquid.

It looks a bit impractical, but when I'm at my computer, [I see this](http://i.imgur.com/OgEmmWE.jpg) and don't worry about all that other stuff which I can't even see.

*****
It's not perfect, though; I do have one major issue. Although the core temp is substantially lower, the video ram (VRAM) temps still can get pretty high if the game is using or close to using all of the available VRAM (1.5 GB). In games where that is an issue, I only overclock the VRAM to 1200 MHz while overclocking the core to 700, 800+ MHz. This results in totally managable core temps, but the VRAM can still hit high 80°s or even 90°. But it doesn't ever go past that. Core clocks affect the framerate much more anyway. 1200 vs 1800 MHz VRAM is only a 1-3 fps difference. However, going from 575 MHz to 800 MHz can give me a 33% or more increase in framerate.

**SCREENSHOTS w/Temps**

Look at the overlay in the top left corner to see the temps and overclock settings. All screenshots were taken after temps stopped rising and playing the game for 5-10 minutes.

Recently, the subreddit has seen an influx of sale/deal related posts. While these posts often provide legitimate cash saving opportunities, we have asked, and continue to ask that our subscribers make use of /r/BuildAPCSales for posts of these nature.

This may cause some of you to question ""Why?"", an understandable position to default to. The fact is that we have grown enormously and continue to do so. As a result, we cannot afford to allow sale/deal posts to consume our already crowded subreddit. This is to ensure that each user looking for help has the best opportunity of having their voice heard.

Therefore, we ask that you, our community, to help us by ensuring all deal/sale related posts go to /r/BuildAPCSales (or /r/BaPCSalesCanada for Canadians). It is a worthwhile subreddit to subscribe to if you are in the market (and sometimes even if you are not). If you wish to combine /r/BuildAPC and /r/BuildAPCSales you may do so [like this](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc+buildapcsales). Any deal/sale posts have been, and continue to be, **removed** from /r/BuildAPC. Users who crosspost deals between /r/BuildAPC and /r/BuildAPCSales will receive a **warning**, informing the user of our policy. Users who see sale/deal posts should **report** them, as this is the best way to bring a post to our attention. Persistent disregard for this policy may result in a **ban**. Bans are not undertaken lightly, but given the limited nature of our tools as moderators, it is the only way we can deal with repeated violations and deliberate ignoring of the rules.

We would also like to take this opportunity to ask that users refrain from posting pictures of their initial shipment of component boxes as individual posts. Pictures of this nature are welcomed as a part of the [Build Complete] tag, which should contain pictures and information for the entire build process. Our reasoning and enforcement regarding this matter is essentially the same as the aforementioned policy. We know and understand the excitement of posting your heap of expensive components, we have all been there, but we must try to optimize our space.

I thank you all for your time, and please understand that we are not trying to restrict our users by adding rules and policies. We simply want to maintain the integrity of the subreddit by staying true to our core purpose: To help people build a PC. The vast majority of our community has been and continues to be an enormous help by voting, reporting and contributing to the community in ways they see fit. This message has been looked over by the majority of my fellow moderators, and is therefore a message from all of us. Please do not hesitate to raise questions and concerns, otherwise, thank you once again and happy building!

Over the past year and half I have been fortunate enough to become involved in this community in nearly every possible aspect.  After a quick redirect from /r/hardware, I built my first computer with the help and knowledge of this sub back when it was under 30000 subscribers.  From that point on, I was hooked.  I began commenting on every new post and learning as much as possible about building methods and the specifics of the parts involved in the process.  Somewhere along the way I decided to toss my name in for a potential moderator position.  After a few months of waiting, the mod team ended up selecting me and my role in the sub changed drastically.  The past year or so as a mod has been quite a blur - We started Tech Tuesdays, established an IRC channel, ran huge giveaways, partnered with manufacturers and implemented some really nice tweaks to the sub stylesheet.  It has certainly been a one of a kind experience.

With that in mind, I have a bittersweet announcement to make today.  I have accepted a position over at [PCPartPicker](http://pcpartpicker.com/) as the Community Manager and Technical Specialist.  To avoid any potential conflicts of interest that may arise from this new job I will be stepping down as a moderator of /r/buildapc by the end of the month.  I can't really put into words how excited I am for this new opportunity and chapter in my life.  Without you, the community, none of this would have been possible and I truly will miss working behind the scenes for you all.

So with the big announcement out of the way I know that some users were requesting AMAs from the moderators...  To accommodate those requests, I will be answering any and all questions that you may have for me this evening.  I will be monitoring this thread, the [BaPC IRC](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=reddit-buildapc), and I will be [streaming some games](http://www.twitch.tv/manirelli) this evening (starting about 930PM CST) if you wanna watch or yell at me in Teamspeak.

Thanks again for everything /r/buildapc and keep an eye out for some great new content and features from PCPartPicker in the coming months,

Hello!

I have a windows 7 64 Bit Home Key available. I was going to sell it on eBay but figured someone else could use this key more than I can use the $25 or for whatever it would sell for.

anyway, this is a 64 Bit English (US) version of windows 7 Home edition. I got it about 2 years ago when I got my laptop. I installed WIN 7 PRO on it immediately, so this key hasn't seen any use. 

so, the requirements are that you need to be in a position where you can't spare another $100 for an OS, or that the cost of an OS will be too much for you. I know everyone in college is poor (I myself am in one) and has a lot of debt, but if you're living off of mommy and daddy, you dont count! 

aside from that, I'll let you interpret what the rest of that definition of ""financially struggling"" is. I dont need to hear your story or anything on why you qualify for that and besides, its a personal thing. All you need to do is just post here, or PM me if you wish to be anonymous and at the end of the day, I'll choose one person at random. Your chances of winning the key are the same regardless of whether you PM me or post here.

also, please dont try to cheat for the key. You're not scamming me, but are scamming someone who actually needs the key.

finally, in the future, if you can, try to pay this forward for someone else :P

**Edit**

**Update 1** Okay..umm...I just got back home from the library to see how this thread was doing. 

1: Thank you for your kind words. I'm just doing part of my share of helping others out. No one ever gets to where they are alone, there's ALWAYS people behind them whether its school, career, life, or even PC building.

2: I told you guys not to tell me why you needed it, but just to write here to indicate that you wanted to participate lol. I was expecting just ""put me in"" but instead I came back to a wall of paragraphs, haha. (I'm sorry, I'm not laughing at your problem, but just the fact that you guys did more than what you had to)

3: I counted up the posts here and my messages asking for the key. There's a total of 43 (not including the people who were giving me their kind words). I will use a random number generator to pick a number. And whoever was that number to send me the message will get the key. For example, if the random number generator gives me 34, whoever was the 34th person to either post here or send the message will get the key.

4: I understand that it may be against the TOS or it may not work to give a key tied to a hardware. I instead have a spare Win 7 Pro key that I bought from /r/hardware swap that hasn't seen use since I bought. I will instead give that key away. I'll work something out with whoever was second place.

5- Whoever the winner is, I'll contact them to give them the key. Its up to them if they want to publicize who they are, as I won't be doing that.

**Update 2** Winner has been selected and a spare Win 7 Pro key has been sent (not the Win 7 Home, because apparently, that's illegal?)

I apologize if I wasn't able to reach you. Regardless, I wish you all the best of luck. And for those of you going through some hardships (all of us, regardless of how big or small it is): I'd like to share with you the words my parents tell me: you only lose when you decide to give up. Nothing ever gets easier, but the important thing is that when you come out of the hardship, you come out stronger and more knowledgeable than before. Don't count on anyone making everything easier for you, but do lend a hand to someone else if you're able.

I originally built this a couple years ago. However, just a couple weeks ago I made some upgrades and took some pictures along the way. 

I originally had a laptop HDD and some small fans I scrounged together, but they didn't work very well in the end. The fans were soldered to connectors, were too loud and caused too much vibration. The HDD was severely affected by that. Also I didn't feel comfortable about the way the motherboard tray was mounted.

With the new upgrades I purchased some proper fans with motherboard headers. To be precise they're Fractal Design Silent Series R2 40MM (intake) and two 50MM (outtake). I also swapped the HDD for a 64 GB SSD which is still more than enough for this PC. I put in some actual motherboard mounting screws to hold it in place and now I'm not so concerned about it falling.

I use a remote with keypad and trackpad to operate it and it has Windows 7 on it.

For a screensaver I use the UberNES Nintendo Saver 2011. I like being able to jump into any game being displayed and play it.

**Edit 1:**
Comment section now contains an interesting discussion. Please read if you have the time.
Here are my reasons for the choice of hardware, if you're interested: http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/uufnu/i_help_people_build_pcs_here_is_my/c4yn739
___
**Edit 2:**
If you can afford it, upgrading to a cheap GTX560 or an HD6850 will net you some extra gaming performance.
___
**Edit 3:**

**When I said Skyrim Maxed I meant the following:**

&gt;Full HD Resolution(1080P).

&gt;Ultra Preset.

&gt;2x Antialiasing.

&gt;FXAA Set to OFF

&gt;No vertical sync

&gt;Over 40FPS on average.

**And Diablo III Maxed at 4xAntialiasing is a non-issue as well**

___
**EDIT 4:**
Many alternate setups are being proposed. My reasons for these parts are still the following:

High durability

Long Lifespan

Upgradability

A Good Audio-Codec on the motherboard (Unlike all these Biostar boards suggested)

A Case with removable dust filters and two large (12CM) fans.
___
**EDIT 5:**
*Tip of the day*:

If you feel like you can do without a DVD Drive or the operating system - feel free to ignore those parts of the setup ;)
**BONUS EDIT: LIVE IN THE UK? IS AN HD6850 CHEAPER? GET THAT INSTEAD!**
___
**Final Edit:**

Now you may find a couple of better-value setups at this price point, and I may not be completely updated on some of the very specific hardware details. But I can assure that the parts are compatible and they will yield a good gaming PC.
I apologize for any mistakes I may have made or deals I may have overlooked in the making of this guide.

What part of the computer did Overclock.net get me so interested in? 

**The Power Supply.**

Simply put it's one of the most overlooked and important parts of the pc. Most new builders will completely forget and just get what is cheapest, but the intricacies of it are far to complex to just throw a dart and buy the first one you find.

So here are a few links, these are very well done and they are basically my first source when I need to find out about a psu.

I'm that serious, there are reasons why those are up there and if you want those reasons then I will be personally glad to explain each one. Furthermore that thread links to the best review of it, not your average joe reviews actuall testing equipment that measures various things to objectively prove a psu's worth.

This thread is also an epic post by another epic contributor to Overclock.net. Phaedrus is the voice of reason and gets the last word on everything over there. He taught me more then any one else when I mentioned to him that I was interested in helping out in that forum. This thread is a relatively new one, and I was not around when it was originally published but reading over it today I can say it's good information. Likewise if it comes from Phaedrus I know it is without even having to proof read it myself. If you are wondering about just how beefy of a psu you will need then that thread will steer you in the right direction.

**[shinji2k PSU Review Database](http://www.overclock.net/power-supplies/738097-psu-review-database.html)** Once aqain Shinji2k is one of those guys you don't question. He literally is one of the most knowledgeable people on that forum, and personal I think he's a great guy. This thread is the last word on any psu, it highlights good reviews, and makes sure you get good information. This thread does not only showcase the best, but also the worst. It's worth the read if you are not sure if a psu is good or not. Once again if a psu is not on this list then it is not worth buying, it's not worth the risk. It could be the best psu in the world but it would never have a good recommendation from myself or anyone else informed on the state of the psu market, for the simple fact that we haven't objectively proven it at this point.

Between these three links I feel you are given basically all the information you will need to not only suggest to new people but also make informed decisions for yourself. I do urge each an every one of you to either make an account there or at least to one of the many tech forums around the internet. That one being my all time favorite Once again though I'm not as in the loop as I used to be( hopefully as that will change seeing how I will be constructing a new pc soon) but I've not lost the experience that has made me into the person today. Part of that experience is knowing that by and large the most important part of the pc is that of the power supply for the simple fact that a good one will cost you more then you want to spend if you don't research into it, and that a bad one can absolutely destroy your computer.

I'll be taking all questions but from here on out I will make sure not to just post a link and be on my way as I understand the newer people need a bit of explanation especially when it's about a power supply they don't even care about.

**Big thank you to Nubbinator, he deserves many an upvote as he provided a link to a site that has every platform for every mainstreem PSU on the market from what I can tell.**

Just a couple notes on the cost. I was able to get the RAM for a lot less when it was in stock and also I purchased the PSU, 680s, and case used. So the final budget was about $2700.

Sleeving was done with MDPC.

Overall I'm very happy with the final build. Cable management was pretty difficult, but I think it turned out well. As for overclocking I have the 3820 at 4Ghz for now, and both Lightnings at 1.2Ghz core and +550Mhz on the memory. I haven't overvolted yet, so there still might be some performance to be had.

Temps for the CPU and graphics cards hover around 35C after several hours of Battlefield 3, and the CPU will hit a max of about 45C on Prime95.

I've owned every playstation console except the Vita, and never gamed on a PC. I don't play games THAT much, probably 3-5 hours a week, except for certain times if I get occasionally addicted to a game. I understand how if cost wasn't a factor, buying a $1000-$1500 PC would blow a console out of the water, but I just don't want to spend that much. I don't have a monitor, but (maybe) I could use my 40 inch TV? Is it worth it to consider a PC with a budget really similar to the PS4, or do you have to spend a lot more to make the PC worth it?

EDIT: Thanks for all the replies. At the end of the day I'm still pretty torn, but I have a lot of new information. It's still a while away before I'll actually buy anything, but I suppose it comes down to depending on what you do with it, an expensive PC could be better in the long run, but if you don't utilize it a console could be cheaper.

_______________________________________________________________________

I was planning on making this list for the past builds completed within the last 30 days. Turns out there's a fuck ton.

So I'm sitting here in front of my computer and I ask myself

&gt; *remaker12 why the fuck are you doing this?*

*I don't know*

&gt; *You're tired and you haven't eaten anything all day you stupid retard*

*Am I talking to myself or is that water bottle talking to me?*

&gt; *You also have to complete the forms for IPL4 and you didn't get to play DOTA2 today*

*I'm not touching the water bottle so why are there ripples forming inside?*

&gt; *Go to bed idiot. People don't need this. There's a search bar.*

*Why does Nestle make bottled water? Isn't that a chocolate company? Or is that Nestea? No, Nestea is a starcraft II player.*

As you can see I'm losing my mind. Thus, this list is between 1 month ago and 28 days ago. I am going to bed. I hope someone finds it useful.

I own an independent game store, and we do repairs and cleanings for customers on both consoles and computers. Just wanted to stress the importance of keeping your systems clean. I know for many this seems like a no brainer, but you'd be amazed how many people let their systems sit and get filthy. Here is an example of a [PS3](http://imgur.com/8sSq9) we just did, and this is not even close to the worst we've seen (for those wondering, the grime is so dark because the owner smoked around their system). I dont have a picture on hand of some of the computers we've done, but I have seen some horrible things (think spiders nests and computers coated in sand). Even though it isnt a PC, the same principles apply, so open your case up once in awhile and clean it! We use an air compressor over canned air to avoid spraying the chemicals from the can into the system, but canned air is better than nothing. Also, 90% and above isopropyl alcohol and a Q-tip is a great way to clean dirty disc drives and lenses that wont cause damage to their ability to read discs.

Letting dust and debris (not to mention if you smoke indoors) settle on your parts will raise operating temps, inhibit airflow, and shorten the life of your components. A PSU caked in grime could catch fire or short your whole system. Building the system is the most fun part of being a PC enthusiast, but keeping it clean will keep your rig brag worthy.

Again, sorry I only have a PS3 to demonstrate, and for most this is probably common knowledge, but for newbies concerned with keeping their systems in top shape, these are some guidelines Id recommend following. Your budget build is going to cost a lot more than you think if you have to replace parts due to neglect. If you have other techniques to share, please do!

*EDIT: It has been pointed out to me that I should note one thing: Im NOT advocating opening consoles under warranty. The picture of the PS3 was intended to serve as a reminder that computer parts attract dust and debris, not my advocacy of opening your consoles to clean them while still warrantied. I apologize if this was unclear, if your console has a manufacturer's warranty, DONT OPEN IT unless you are willing to face the consequences. I make it clear to all my customers that this will void any warranty support, and I should have noted this here more clearly as well.

You can now include a price with any custom parts you add to your part list.  That price will then be included in your part list total, Reddit markup, price history graph, saved and completed builds, etc.

Additionally, you can now edit custom parts as well, so if you have existing part lists you can easily add price information to any custom parts in those part lists.  (Doing so will create a new part list permalink, FWIW)

For the custom parts, right now it only shows the price if you are in the same region (and hence currency) that it was entered from.  If there is sufficient interest I can add in currency conversion based off of current exchange rates.  That way if you entered it in, say, GBP, someone from another country could view it and get a reasonable estimate on what price you paid.

I love it, and without you guys, I never would have thought to try it.  For that, I thank you!

Secondly, my dad has an HP Pavilion laptop he picked up at Best Buy last year.  The charged him an arm and a leg to ""set it up"" for him by transferring his files from his old laptop and installing God knows what.  Well, it crapped out on him a few nights ago and he took it to *fucking Staples.*  They were going to charge him around $350 to give him a new hard drive, transfer his data, and do a fresh install of Windows including all of the HP bloatware.  The ""diagnostic"" alone cost $70.  When I heard this, I told him to call them right away and to cancel the order.  He did, and I got his laptop later that day.

I tooled around with it and found it completely unresponsive.  It would boot up and take about 5 or so minutes to load to the desktop, and then it would just sit and not do anything.  Task manager took forever to load, and nothing seemed to be over-stressed.  I was scared it was the hard drive itself, so I connected it to my desktop to see if I could access his files and back them up that way.  It worked, and I did a fresh install of Windows after getting his HDD back in the laptop.  This seems to have done the trick, and I have drilled it into my dad's head to back up his data, which, of course, he never thought to do.

I suppose there's still a risk of it actually being a hardware issue, but this is certainly a cheaper way to find out.  And if it is, Amazon, Newegg or Microcenter are certainly cheaper than Staples.

I got everything at Microcenter because I didn't want to wait a week for it to come here. I am impatient, and if I ordered most things online I could of saved ~$30. I went to Microcenter for the CPU + MOBO combo deal, buy the AMD 960T and get a free motherboard.

I made a [Build Complete] post a month or two ago, when I first built the PC. Since then I added a GPU, another fan, a disk drive, did some cable management and removed the HDD cage.

It plays Diablo 3 (beta) on max with ~50FPS, MW3 max at constant 60FPS, Tera maxed out at 60FPS, GTA medium at 50FPS. Resolution is always at 1920x1080. I haven't gotten the chance to play other games.

Temps are normal, under a full load it gets around 50 Celcuis. 

I plan on putting an SDD in there next. Then upgrade the PSU + get a custom heatsink so I can overclock and unlock the two extra cores in my CPU.

1366500955.0,301,self.buildapc,1crqcl,The True Cost of Building with a Cheap Power Supply.,357,56,202,http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/1crqcl/the_true_cost_of_building_with_a_cheap_power/,"This is a ""Public Service Announcement"" style post, describing from experience why you should NEVER build with a cheap power supply or a power supply from a manufacturer that is not reputable.

I built my computer Christmas of 2011, just a few months over a year ago. When I built my computer I didn't have any idea what reddit even was, and consequently no idea what this amazing subreddit was, so all my research was done on my own. I didn't have a clue what manufacturers were considered decent and I just looked for the specifications I needed at the lowest price, while maintaining relatively good reviews. I used [THIS](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817517001) power supply for $40 when I built. 

This past week I was playing some games on my computer as usual and suddenly my computer just shut off.. I tried to turn it back on and the fans twitched and my power supply whined so I shut it off and pulled the PSU out. I put it on my table and plugged it in and jumped it and the PSU fan once again just twitched and the component whined. I figured ""Well that kinda sucks, guess I gotta go to Micro Center and get a new one."" I can't say I didn't see something like this occurring at some point after reading on this subreddit about always buying a power supply from a reputable manufacturer, I just didn't expect it to go so soon, only a little over a year of use. So I went to Micro Center and picked up one of [THESE](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817139051&amp;Tpk=corsair%20cx750m&amp;IsVirtualParent=1) for $80 and brought it home. I unboxed it and stuck it in my case, making sure everything was plugged in. Turned on my computer and the fans spun up, fantastic! I shoved all the extra SATA cables and stuff behind the side panel on my case and then plugged my peripherals in. Turned my computer on again and hopped into my computer chair excited to have a working computer again... but something was odd, neither of my monitors picked up a signal. Thought maybe I forgot to plug something in, so I rechecked it all. Nothing was unplugged, so I took my graphics card out and reinserted it into the PCI-e slot. Still no video. So I plugged into my onboard video and that finally gave me a signal, Windows booted but my card was not recognized in the device manager. So I rebooted into my BIOS and went to the system browser and hovered the mouse over my first PCI-e slot where the card was plugged in. Nothing was detected in that slot. So at this point I'm panicking that my power supply fried my 7950 (would've preferred it at this point) so I pulled my entire system apart and built a testing set up on the motherboard box, got all the essentials in and still no video, so definitely no error on my part. So I took the 5450 off my shelf and plugged that into the PCI-e slot, still no video. The cheapy power supply fried the PCI-e slots on my [MOTHERBOARD](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813157296), which I bought at Micro Center in June of 2012 for $80. So now I'm going to try RMA'ing the board, but I'm skeptical that ASRock is going to let it go through because I added an aftermarket fan that replaced the stock fan mount, which I then stupidly misplaced before a move across the country. 
 
 

If my RMA fails and I have to buy another board, the same one is $110 on Newegg.

So in total my cheapy power supply has now cost me a minimum of:

$40 - for the original PSU

$80 - for the replacement PSU

$120 total.
 
 

If my RMA fails, building with a cheap power supply has now cost me:

$40 - for the original PSU

$80 - for the replacement PSU

$80 - for the board it fried

$110 - for replacing the board it fried

$310 total
 
 

TL;DR: PLEASE BaPC'ers, NEVER build with a cheap power supply just to save some money. Use a reputable company. My 15 year old ignorance has now turned a $40 dollar purchase into a $120 purchase at minimum and a $310 purchase if the RMA on my board doesn't go through.

EDIT: Formatting is hard... suggestions are pretty welcome, it's a train wreck up there.

Long time no see. I am still in the process of getting my degree done and it is **not** fun. And because stuff, food and PC parts are kind of expensive I have to exchange my labour for money. -&gt; Not a lot of time for BaPC, but chilling a bit around /r/photography to learn something for my part-time work.

But hey, we all like contests and the wiki needs to be filled with useful guides and damn the devil I will do my part! I even have some picture this time, look down in the text!

PC builders, gamers and editors are a hungry bunch. We are very passionate about our components, but please do not forget that with a very similar skillset (research, a bit of trial and error, a lot of reading *guides* on reddit, forums, blogs etc, a methodical work process) you can cook some quick and delicious meals too without relying too much on premade food or frozen pizzas! Cooking is a very scientific process. Modern frontier chefs are using a lot of science to find new ways to prepare and present food, but also century old cooking techniques are very precise chemical reactions. But just following a guide will get you only so far. Like with overclocking you have to tweak and test it, adjust a little bit of that and a little bit here. 

So what I see a lot in gamer's dens and general bachelor households is canned ravioli with tomato sauce. [This stuff here.]( http://i.imgur.com/wvromdQ.jpg) Canned ravioli lands on a rather unflattering very, very low position on my personal *tasty things* rating. Same as premade VS build your own PC - we can do better! A lot better!

I will show you the basic recipe for a pasta dough for the ravioli with ricotta and mozzarella cheese filling together with a very basic tomato sauce. 

**For the pasta** - ~ a batch of 20-25 ravioli, a bit on the larger side

**~250g** general purpose flour

**~50g** durum wheat semolina
**3** eggs

**2** tablespoons olive oil

**3** pinches of salt

A little bit of addition flour on the side


**For the filling I use**

**~1** box of ricotta cheese (around 300-400g?)

**2 globes** mozzarella cheese

**1** small lemon

**1-3** tablespoons olive oil


**For the tomato sauce**

**1** can of whole tomatoes

**1** small onion

**1** slice of garlic

**a bit* of olive oil for the pan/pot



General spices: salt, pepper, sugar - bonus for oregano, thyme, parsley and rosemary. Extra bonus for parmigiano reggiano.


**Part 1 - Pasta**
I know, every Italian mama knows best how to make pasta and there are thousands of different ways to make it. This here is only my way of doing it, but please feel absolutely free to adjust every part of my recipe to your taste! I even encourage that! The fun part about cooking is to stray away from already beaten paths. Use recipes as your basics, but change or even improve it on your own. 

So I use a mix of general purpose flour and durum wheat flour for my dough. The durum wheat adds a certain bite to your pasta, like in the al dente way. As far as I know industry made dry pasta is fully durum wheat. For fresh pasta you can absolutely mix your flours or even use fully soft general purpose flour if you like! For me personally the 5:1 mix between GP and durum wheat works quite charmingly. Try it out yourselves, but if while eating you feel it needs more bite add more durum wheat the next time.

In the same way I've found 3 eggs to work for me to get the right texture for the dough. Mix all the pasta ingredients into a bowl.  Don't be too easy on the salt. Just a little pinch won't do, but we don't need a full tablespoon either. Lucky are the ones with a kitchen machine or a stirrer with dough addon. All the other ones have to use muscle power. Knead until you get an uniform dough, a little bit sticky but not too much. If it is too sticky, like all over your hands sticky, add more flour! If it is too dry and crumbles add another egg! You should get one nice clump of dough in the end in your bowl, easy to form and just a bit sticky. Let it rest in the fridge for around 30 minutes.

**Part 2 - Filling**

In the meantime to the filling. I have chosen a ricotta-mozzarella mix, because it tastes so very good with tomatoes and it is absolutely easy to make. You can create your own fillings of course, ravioli works with a lot of things. Classic ground beef and mushrooms, salmon, or even greeny things like spinach love to get wrapped in pasta. 

Just mix the ricotta and mozzarella into a bowl. Rub off a bit of the lemon zest to add a slight, fresh flavour to your heavy, soft cheese. Fatty things in general have a very good combo with things that gives you a fresh flavour, like citrus fruits (think like duck and oranges, or steak and cranberries). Be careful with the zest, you can easily overpower your cheese, same with the olive oil. Add both of them in small parts to bowl and add more if needed. If you do not have any special tools to get the zest try a very sharp, short blade. Carefully peel the yellow part of the skin and then cut it down in tiny parts. If you just can't get the zest use the lemon juice, but be careful - don't forget, not too much! Season with salt and pepper and every herb you like. Personal opinion - thyme, rosemary, fresh scallions. [Here we have our filling in the mid, right is slow cooked beef with onions and carrots, left is carrots.](http://i.imgur.com/BAfXkKF.jpg)

That's it! Unto

**Part 3 - Tomato Sauce**

Why canned tomatoes and not fresh ones? Hey I am lazy as everybody else ;) But even more important most fresh supermarket tomatoes here in Europe, especially in winter are from some mass producing farms in Spain or greenhouse in the Netherlands. Not very tasty, more watery than anything else. But if you can get your hands on some local stuff (looking at you, California) or home-grown tomatoes (quite the work to grow them for the yield you can produce at home, but you cannot believe the flavour explosion) do it of course! If you have fresh ones cut an X into the skin in the bottom and put them for 30-60s into boiling water. They will easily peel. Remove the cores, it's mostly water and seeds and you don't want that in a good sauce. All you need is the delicious flesh.

Put your pan or pot on heat. Add the olive oil when heated and let it rest a bit. Don't put anything in the cold oil at first, you want to have temperature. Cut and dice the onion and the slice of garlic. Cook them in the oil. The heat will reduce the amount of sulphur in the onion, making them less sharp and more sweet. When the onions are glassy add your tomatoes. Use your fork or spatula to press them against then pan or pot to make chunky bits. If you need more fluid add stock or water, but especially with canned tomatoes it should be quite fluid. Let it simmer for a bit to reduce your stock into a nice thick sauce. Season with salt, pepper, oregano and sugar. Tomatoes need sweetness as a counterbalance. If you feel that your sauce misses a certain *baaam* add a little bit of acid - lemon juice or white vinegar. But be careful, especially vinegar can quickly overpower your flavours. 

Generally most meals need a certain kind of balance between salt, sweet and sour and most people are missing the sour part.

Set the sauce aside or let it simmer a bit more to reduce it. The goal is a s nicely thick sauce. Look at the end for a photo!

**Part 4 - Assembly, Cooking, Plating**

We are nearly done now. Your pasta should be ready by now, get it out of the fridge. As always there is an easy and a hard way now. Pasta machine for the easy way, rolling pin for the hard way. Get some GP flour ready. Your dough will get sticky from handling it, just dust if off with flour to make it non-stick. Also dust your working space, so the dough won't get glued to it. With a pasta machine just form a flat bit of dough and use your widest settings at first. Reduce thickness by one bit each time you go through. Use one hand on the crank and the other one below the machine to pull the pasta a bit. 

With the rolling pin (or even a big drinking glass, like I used because we didn't have any pasta tools ready) you get a free workout. Dust the working space, dough and rolling pin with GP flour and get rolling. I found that using a roll or glass won't get you a thin pasta like with the machine, but for the ricotta-mozzarella ravioli in a thick tomato sauce a thicker pasta with more bite to it works very well.

Spread the pasta on an area where you can easily put the filling on and then easily overlap it. [Look here for an example.](http://i.imgur.com/E4JHUMX.jpg) You also see that I used a cooking brush with normal tap water to paint the dough. This will help get the dough sticky again, so it will seal itself while overlapping. While overlapping don't press down the dough to seal it at first. Start from the sides of the fillings and press down there and wander outside. You want the air trapped with the fillings to go out first before completely gluing the raviolis together. Be careful here to not rip the pasta apart - thicker cuts will be more resistant of course. 

[Use a knife or pizza roller to cut out the raviolis.](http://i.imgur.com/QND6PY2.jpg) Waste dough goes into the bowl again with the rest of the pasta, you can easily knead it back in. Once cut press down the edges a little more and force them a bit outwards so the pure pasta part doesn't get too thick. With a fork you can enhance the sealing, press down the edges to get the nice visual touch too. I know that people can use a ravioli roller too, but I still would use the extra work with the fork - you won't want the raviolis to open while cooking.

Set a pot with salt water to boil (don't be shy with the salt) and reheat your sauce. Endgame time. Fresh pasta is done very quickly. If you see the ravioli swimming on the surface add maybe a minute to the time and then you can remove them from the water. Use one ravioli as a test - the exact cooking time depends a lot on the thickness of the pasta.

Your sauce can always wait, but not your pasta. Drain it quickly and then plate it. Don't let pasta rest too much in general, it will get sticky and dry, but give it a second to drain the excess cooking water. If your sauce is too thick add a bit of the salty pasta water. Generally don't add oil to your pasta - freshly drained it won't stick, so quickly plate it or even better let it rest in the sauce!

[Once plated with the sauce give a bit of parsley and parmigiano reggiano on top.](http://i.imgur.com/rs1Ja0K.jpg) We were quite hungry, so we didn’t let the pasta drain to long, you can see that there is still a bit of salt water on the bottom of the plate. If you aim for a more prettier presentation let it drain more. 

We had some leftover pasta, so we also made raviolis with the beef, carrot, onion filling from earlier. Add that to a nice beef-veggie stock and you have [a wonderful wintertime soup.]( http://i.imgur.com/WcM6Zw8.jpg)

Don’t be shy with your feedback. While I liked my results very much, I am quite not so familiar in the pasta world like with other foodstuff. Again this is something that worked well for me, but I am sure it can be improved! Generally I will make the raviolis and fillings a bit smaller next time, they tend to grow a bit while cooking. Smaller portions are also easier on the eyes I think.

Bonus chapter for the people who have read so far: Asian Flavours

You can easily add Asian flavours to your meals with a couple of sauces, readily available in Asian groceries stores. Fish sauce, soy sauce, oyster sauce, hoisin sauce, siracha sauce. 

Fish sauce, a very integral part of the Vietnamese cuisine and not unlike the western Worchester sauce is your main player to get saltiness and oomph into your meals. Yes, most Westerners do not like the smell of the pure fish sauce. But it really, really tastes good and once cooked with other ingredients you won’t smell it anymore.  More people are familiar with soy sauce. It is a more subdued saltiness with a bit of sweetness into it. Both sauces complement each other nicely in the saltiness department! Use them as your main flavours in a stir fry for example.
Hoisin and oyster sauces are more thicker and sweeter, but not pure sweet. You will add them to counterbalance the saltiness of the sauces above and to add a glaze for ingredients.
And I think many of you know Siracha sauce. Adds hot and spicy to your food, works as dip as well.

How do you use them? Often and freely ;) For a stir fry get your stuff cooking on high heat, pure in fish and soy sauce, counter and glaze with oyster sauce, season with pepper and a bit of sugar, add hot and spicy with Siracha.

For a quick fried rice: Cook onions and garlic, add tomato paste to oil to get it warm. Add the (already cooked, older and dryer is better) rice, use max heat and let it fry. Fish, soy, hoisin, siracha, pepper – done. If you want veggies and meat to the fried rice, cook them beforehand until roughly ~80 percent done and set aside.  Fry your rice, add meat and veggies at the end to finish the cooking and reheat them.

Stay sharp, have fun cooking and eat well! ~~~your BaPC chef

1348948914.0,304,self.buildapc,10ohn5,How to POST the Essentials,352,48,66,http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/10ohn5/how_to_post_the_essentials/,"**How to POST the Essentials**

So you're putting together your build and you get everything all screwed down, press the power button, and nothing happens. Fear sets in and you begin to believe you've killed your computer, that however is unlikely and I'll walk you through a way you can test and confirm your essentials work by POSTing them outside of the case.

**What are the Essentials?**

* CPU
* Motherboard
* RAM
* Power Supply
* Video Card (If onboard video isn't present)

This tutorial assumes you've installed the CPU and CPU Fan, and everything is unplugged except the CPU Fan.

Newegg covers the following in their [External Build](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_56kyib-Ls&amp;feature=youtu.be) portion of their build video.

**1\. Isolate the Motherboard**

I begin by setting my motherboard up on a flat (non-conductive) surface, if you're unsure you can simply rest it on the motherboard box.

Note: If you've already mounted it to the case, verify that it is on its standoffs and then continue on, if you're unable to get it to boot then retry the following steps but with it removed from your case.

http://i.imgur.com/PD8fh.jpg

**Hey! Isn't potentially dangerous to boot outside the case?**

It can be for instance if you place your motherboard on a conductive surface like a metal or wet counter, or working on a carpeted surface and generating a lot of static electricity rubbing your feet back and forth in your wool socks.

**2\. Connect Power Supply Cables**

There are two main power supply cables that you need to connect to the motherboard:

* 20/24 Pin Motherboard Power
* 4/8 Pin CPU Power

http://i.imgur.com/K1fgq.jpg

**3\. Install 1 Stick of RAM**

To prevent any RAM related issues just remove them all and only use one stick of RAM. The RAM will click down into place when installed properly.

http://i.imgur.com/RPXGK.jpg

**4\. No Onboard Video? Install Video Card**

As you can see here I have no onboard on my motherboard so I have to install a video card. Make sure you plug in the PCI-E (6/8 Pin) power connectors to the video card if required.

http://i.imgur.com/mZjlC.jpg

**5\. Connect Monitor Cable**

If you're using a video card make sure you plug your monitor cable into the video card instead of your motherboard's video output. If your video card doesn't have the output you need (I.e. [VGA](http://i.imgur.com/W9ccL.jpg)) check the video card box for an adapter.

http://i.imgur.com/FfhM4.jpg

**6\. Flip Power Supply Switch On**

Make sure your power supply's little toggle switch on the back is flipped on. Motherboard's with indicator lights will turn on when the power supply is connected and on. The switch should look like [this](http://i.imgur.com/PovPq.jpg) when it's on.

**7\. Short the Power Switch Pins**

Note: If your motherboard has an on-board power switch you can simply use it instead of shorting the pins.

You can either brute force it and tap your screwdriver between any of the two pins or check your motherboard manual. Alternatively if you're not comfortable shorting it with a screwdriver you can bring your case close enough and connect the PWR switch to the motherboard and just press the power button instead.

http://i.imgur.com/lIjEd.jpg

**8a. Success!?** 

Upon shorting the power switch pins you should notice that the fan(s) have turned on and you can see a BIOS/POST screen on your monitor. You are now ready to start putting your build back to together one piece at a time.

http://i.imgur.com/n9MdO.jpg

If you aren't seeing the BIOS screen on your monitor verify that you plugged the monitor cable into the right spot (refer to Step 5) and that it is firmly plugged all the way in. Also make sure your monitor is set on the right input source as sometimes they can be set to display DVI when you only have a VGA plugged in and vice versa.

**8b. Nothing happened.**

Here's a small collection of troubleshooting tips:

* Double-check your essential power connections.
* Try re-seating your stick of RAM in a different slot.
* Verify that you are getting power from the power outlet.
* Make sure your power supply's switch is flipped to the on position.
* [Verify that your power supply works](http://www.corsair.com/en/blog/testing-your-corsair-power-supply). If it doesn't then [RMA](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/10ohn5/how_to_post_the_essentials/c6fefrn) it.

If you're able to verify that your power supply does work then I would [RMA](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/10ohn5/how_to_post_the_essentials/c6fefrn) the motherboard, and retry POSTing the essentials when the replacement comes in.",,False,,t5_2rnve,1368917122.0,,,True,t3_10ohn5,http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/10ohn5/how_to_post_the_essentials/,

To solve this problem we **should**

- Place a before-post warning telling posters to check /r/buildapcforme if they need a build made for them. 

- Either pose a warning for anyone that asks for a build, or introduce /r/buildapcforme in the sidebar and through mod posts.

I hope this ""problem"" gets adressed and buildapcforme receives some more posts.

&gt;[Build Help] Pretty psyched for my first build. Wanna look over?

&gt;[Build Help] any tips for my first build?

NO! That isn't how titles should be! Do it like [this!](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/ucuy7/build_read_lowmid_range_gaming_pc_around_500/)

**[Build Help] (low end, midrange, high end) (gaming, media, family) Build - (budget)**

Is that so difficult? Here, have some examples:

&gt;[Build Help] Low-end FAMILY build (Facebook) - $350

.

&gt;[Build Help] High-end GAMING build (Crysis 3) - $1200

.

&gt;[Build Help] Midrange GAMING build (D3) - $650

.

&gt;[Build Help] Midrange HTPC - $500

Just follow that format, and make all the kind people here helping to correct your mistakes have easier lives.

I personally like making budget builds for people, so this would help me easily identify budget builds. Some people might have helpful insight about media or HTPC builds, they'll find their area of expertise more easily, too.

So, let's review:

**[Build Help]** *pretty standard, indicates that you're researching parts, etc.*

**range of build** *I see this as ""how long do you want this computer to stay current?"". Low-end builds will become outdated more quickly than a high-end.*

**type of build** *gaming, family, HTPC, media server, etc. use caps for this part.*

**- If gaming build**, put the most intensive game you'll be playing in the title. not 40 games, one game. This helps us see if your expectations are reasonable, or if you're overpaying.

**budget** *this one's real simple. how much are you willing to spend? NOT how much your current parts list is, YOUR BUDGET*

**TL;DR: Follow a simplified format for post titles, to keep things neat.**

I think a lot of people could benefit from having a response to their questions or requests in a video format as apposed to text. 

Eventually, since I don't have the startup money at the moment, I could actually order parts and get realtime benchmarks or walk the requestor through a build of their exact parts.

Building computers is a huge hobby of mine, and I absolutely love helping people with their computer problems. What bothers me (and many, MANY other people of this community) is that people ask for help, but give no information whatsoever. I don't want to call out anyone, but I have helped people who just post their build, and simply say ""it doesn't work."". I have to go ahead and ask them what the issue is, when I could have already had it. Not only does it aid the people you are receiving free tech support from by not having to ask the same questions over and over, but your issue will be resolved faster. To troubleshoot, we need as much information as we can get, to get a precise idea of what's wrong.
____
In a [Build Help] Thread

-Post what the build will be used for. I probably have more comments asking this that than the amount of posts with help.

-Post any specific parts you need. Sometimes I would remove a video card to lower the cost, and you complain saying that you need it to render videos.
_____
In a [Build Ready] Thread

-Post what you expect from us. Don't just post the build, and say ""improve it"". We need to know what to improve. Do you want it to be cheaper? Do you want to find better parts? Do you want a performance upgrade? We have no idea what you want us to do with the build.

-Again, post what the machine will be used for. I don't know if I should upgrade your GPU or CPU with the extra 100$ you can add.
___
In a [Troubleshooting] Thread

-Post what you THINK the issue is. I don't care if it's the first time you have touched a computer, if you think it's the motherboard, then we we at least have a starting point and can troubleshoot from there

-Post what you have done so far. ""did you try unplugging it?"" ""yes"". I could have been at another step if you said what you have done. It also eliminated all the comments stating the obvious, because you already did it. But we don't know.

-For the love of god, TELL us what is wrong. If you just show us a part list, and say ""well, the video card doesn't work"". That can be anything. Explain what happens when you turn on your computer. Does the video card make a rattling noise? Are you getting no video? Are the fans spinning? We absolutely need this information.
___


You need to remember, we all do this for free, so the least you can do is make it easier for us to help. We can't help at all with ""it doesn't work"". Not only does it wastes our time,  your time too, when we are asking the same questions, asking questions you already already know the answer to, or not giving us enough (any) information on what's wrong with your system.

So far, it's looking like the FX-8350 should be a solid performer and a good alternative for those not wanting to go with Intel.  It looks to be especially good for people doing heavily threaded work.  It's still behind Intel in single threaded work and still a little behind in gaming, but it looks like it falls somewhere between the i5-3570k and i7-3770k in most multi-threaded tasks.",,False,,t5_2rnve,1351028358.0,,,True,t3_11xe82,http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/11xe82/amd_fx8350_review_thread/,

I have no idea where to begin but I do want to make something awesome for my baby-daddy, as he's the best father/partner in this world. He works his ass off. Oh and he's obsessed with playing DiabloIII on an illegal version of windows on his Imac. He makes remarks about how good the quality would be on a PC or laptop. I've been stashing away money for months now and I have enough to get him or make him something special. 
Reddit, help me figure this out in time for his birthday at the end of the month!

Thank you!

Edit: Thank you to everyone who has responded with so much great advice. It looks as though I will be taking Ferca up on his offer to sell me his i5 CPU, 750 Watt Power Supply, motherboard, and case for only $150! So kind. That way, I will be able to spend a lot more on videocard, Ram and Monitor. This is amazing. I am so excited to put it together and then update you all. 

Edit2: Ferca never responded to the PM, but I'm giving him a few more days to respond. If he doesn't, I'm going to go ahead and order off Newegg. Thank you for all the support and advice, Reddit.

Wanted my Brother to play Diablo 3 with me, so I built this for him.  Nothing flashy.  It was a fun build.  The case was a bit tough to work with - you can see the cables are a bit gnarly.

I was surprised by how awesome the motherboard was considering it cost $15-it's pretty basic, though.

I've already tried out D3 on the machine and it plays pretty well.  I may fiddle with it some more before I give it to him next week, but it's pretty much done.

EDIT: Glad everyone liked the build!  I think there were a lot of questions posted that I didn't get to answer.  The most popular questions seemed to be ""How will this system handle ""'XYZ?'""  I haven't played all current games on the build so I'm not sure.  I think this build will handle most current games at least on lower settings.  Usually you can find info on the game sites about minimum/recommended specs.  

I also have been getting questions like ""What sorts of upgrades would you recommend?""  That's kind of a can of worms sort of question; I'd want to upgrade the CPU-then the MOBO-then the GPU-then throw in an SSD, and then all of a sudden the build is $800.  This build wasn't really made for upgrade-ability.  It was more of a cost thing. 

The best advice I can give everyone looking to make their own PC is start with a budget, do your research on [PC Part Picker](http://pcpartpicker.com/), then post the list of parts on the buildapc subreddit for feedback.  If you have questions, google should be your first resource and then if you can't find the answer, post a Build Help thread here.

I should note that I will be ordering the parts in a month or so when I get enough money. In the meantime I want to make sure that the parts will work with each other, there won't be any bottlenecking, and will be getting a nice gaming rig for some future game development at a reasonable price. I would like to keep it as close to $800 as possible (and less than $1000 including a good monitor). 

* CPU: I chose that A10-5800K because to me it seemed like a good deal looking at its benchmarks.
* Mobo: Wanted something with USB 3.0.
* RAM: If the one 8GB ram is not enough for autocad/UDK/unity, I want to be able to easily add another 8GB.
* Graphics Card: I did a good amount of research to find a good graphics card for my budget, and settled with the HD7770. Saw some good reviews on it and from the tests I saw on youtube it ran games like BF3 on high settings really well.

I would also like to add a monitor, preferably one that can display good HD. Around 21 inches would be enough I think, 24 inches being the highest that I would need. And with the possibility of having a second monitor a few months later. Questions: is the PSU enough for this build? Would I need a CPU cooler? (I don't think I would since I don't plan on OC'ing.)

This is my first time attempt at building my own PC. After 20 years of sharing a room, I finally have my own room so I have the liberty of getting this.

My goal was to spend less than $350 on hardware, so less than $450 total with the cost of windows (had to play netflix), so it looks like I just came in under the limit (this is the first time I've actually added it all up). 

All in all I'm really pleased with the build. I was hoping for low power, and it pulls about 27W idle, and maxes out at 52W when running cinebench and prime95 simultaneously, along with having a the CD drive and HDD active. I also wanted low noise and while you can hear the one fan if there is no other source of noise in the room it's barely louder than a whisper and as soon as the TV is on you can't hear it at all. 

My only major disappointment is the look of the front of the case. It just seems too plain to me, and the USB and IR ports stick out like a sore thumb. I might end up taking some time and inlay some strips of walnut to dress it up a bit and hopefully disguise the ports a bit. 

I am really pleased with the mechanics of the case. I thought the top might be too loose with it just hanging off the 4 little slider feet, but once I have the back screwed on it's really solid feeling. Also, the buttons work a lot better than I expected them to and barely stick at all (no more than some cases I've owned).",,False,,t5_2rnve,False,,,True,t3_skt0y,http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/skt0y/build_complete_htpc_with_custom_case/,

I'm not sure about other mobos, but ASUS makes it pretty easy to [update your BIOS splash screen](http://imgur.com/CN5Yt) (that first image you see when you turn the PC on).  If you've completed your build, but still want to tinker with things, it's a simple way to make the PC even more you.

Some of you asked for a guide, so here you go.  It's actually pretty simple (on Asus mobo p8z77-v):

* Install the AI Utility Suite that came with your mobo.
* Run this program and select the ""update"" tab
* Select the Update MyLogo Option
* Choose one of three methods for updating your logo: 1) Change the BIOS boot logo of my motherboard (not available for all users) 2) Change the boot logo of a downloaded BIOS file and update the BIOS to my motherboard 3) Change the boot logo of a downloaded BIOS file (but do not upload this to my motherboard).
* Select your logo (needed to be 640x480)
* Flash your BIOS with the update (this is apparently somehwat risky and you can brick your mobo if you do it wrong, so make sure you fully understand the process of updating your BIOS from your user's manual)

Please note that the above guide is for my specific mobo.  If you're an ASUS owner, the tool is called MyLogo or MyLogo2 and may or may not be part of the AI Utility Suite.  Check out the Asus Updater Utility for this tool if it's not in the AI Suite.

1350309132.0,281,self.buildapc,11ie2v,A quick guide to taking better pictures of your new PC.,350,69,56,http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/11ie2v/a_quick_guide_to_taking_better_pictures_of_your/,"I'm reposting this with the hopes that a few more about-to-build people will read it.


So all your parts have arrived and you've already got your PCPartPicker [Build Complete] post formatted? Now all that's left is to assemble it, snap some pictures, and hit submit! Right??
I know it's tempting to want to get your work out there to show all of us on Reddit that sweet new rig of yours as soon as possible, but please, take an extra 15 minutes to make sure your pictures are decent. It's such a shame to see a really cool build submission accompanied by the comment ""sorry for the blurry pictures!""
So, what can you do?


1.  Make sure you've got good lighting in the room. Turn the lights on, open the shades, etc. Flood that room with light! Ok, so maybe you're like me and the PC lives in the basement without good lighting. So, what do you do?

2.  Make sure you're using a flash when appropriate. Digital Cameras / DSLRs will generally have a built in flash that triggers automatically. If the flash is going off, that means there isn't enough light in the room. It's OK to use a flash, but you've got to use it the right way. With so many metallic / reflective surfaces in a PC, the flash can do some funky stuff. You'll want to diffuse the flash (if you're reading this guide, I'm assuming you're not an avid photographer with an OCF). This means you'll want to put something translucent in front of the flash, like toilet/tissue paper, or even notebook paper. The goal is to turn that blinding ball of white into a soft, even glow. This will keep your pictures from having parts that are blown out (all white with no detail) while at the same time places that are too dark.

3.  Decide what you're trying to show in each picture you take. Don't just point the camera at the mobo and say ""look how cool this is!"" Are you trying to show off a unique heatsink? The perfect color coordination between your RAM and your mobo? Some shrink-wrapped cable management? Decide what you want the viewer to look at and ensure that is the focal point of your shot (I'm not going into rule of thirds here, though). Focal point in this context means where the viewer's eye is going, btw. FOCUS is why everything is blurry.

4.  Speaking of FOCUS, ensure that the damn picture isn't blurry. There are a number of reasons why a shot might be blurry and I'll try to cover a few, but it might be beyond the scope of this post. Here's a quick troubleshoot check-list if your shot is blurry.

* There might not be enough light. With too little light, many cameras will compensate by slowing down the shutter speed. This means that the camera is recording information for a longer period of time (for instance .25 seconds vs .001 seconds). If this is the case, the camera is far more sensitive to movement, meaning even if you think you're holding it perfectly still, those tiny movements will show up. To solve this issue, add more light. If you can't add more light, try a tripod (or setting the camera down on a flat surface and using a remote/timer mode to trigger the shot).

* The actual focal point (what the camera is deciding to focus on) is on something other than what you want. Like your cat in the background. I don't want to go into depth of field here, but think of the focal point as the ""sweet spot"" a certain distance away from your camera. Depending on the settings, the sweet spot will have a limited range. Maybe one or two feet further than the sweet spot back up to one or two feet closer to the camera. Like this (imagine this is a camera on the left looking to the right): CAMERA&gt;====ssFss====PC The F is your focal point and the s is anywhere in focus. If you're trying to take a picture of the PC in the above situation, it will be blurry since it isn't in that defined range. To fix this, you need to either adjust in camera what you're focusing on (many cameras these days have a little rectangle that pops onto the LCD showing what the focus point is), or move closer/further away to ensure your target is in the right range.

5  Do a bit of work before uploading to the web. Maybe to get the shot in focus, you had to stand really far back? Well, we don't need to see your dirty floor and roomate's shoe collection. Go ahead and crop out distracting things from your picture. The end shot that you post should only really contain what you want to show is. If there's something in the shot, we're gonna look at it. And if it's not what you want us to be looking at, it detracts from the shot. Don't worry if you don't have heavy duty photoshop tools, that's ok. If you've got them, and know how to use them though, I'd definitely recommend cleaning up the colors and contrast a bit. The hard part about PCs is that you've got things that are both very bright and very dark all in the same space, which modern cameras have a hard time dealing with. If you're noticing this problem with your pictures, you can try adjusting things like brightness, contrast, fill light, recovery, and clarity settings.

6  Tell a story with your album upload. Now, this is personal preference. Some people like looking at 30 different shots. For me, I get bored quickly, I just want to see a few snazzy pics and move on to the next one. Either way is fine for you, just know that the more pictures you post, the smaller your audience will be (like a YouTube video. You're far more likely to watch :30 vs 30:00.) I also prefer the least amount of clicks, so a scrolling option on the album is what I use, but think about what you want the experience for your viewers to be like.

7  Title / Caption the pictures. Call out anything you want us to look at, or tell a funny story about installing that one piece. Anything is fine, but giving us a bit of context can dramatically improve a picture.


Ok, I think that's a good start. But hit me up in the comments if you've got questions. [Here's the album from the build I posted last week](http://imgur.com/a/YK0M2), btw.

1326040026.0,283,self.buildapc,o81j2,Novice? First Timer? I was too! Some tips for newbs from a recent convert...,336,53,75,http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/o81j2/novice_first_timer_i_was_too_some_tips_for_newbs/,"First off, I love this sub. I love it so much if it were a person I'd marry it without hesitation. I came here during a bored Thanksgiving weekend with vague thoughts of building my own computer since my craptop seemed to be on it's last leg. At the time I was an absolute computer-DIY newb, and was not even sure what GPU stood for. And while I considered my google-fu skills excellent and could spout reddit memes with the best of them; my knowledge (and experience) with hardware was sorely lacking.

To be honest I found this whole process pretty overwhelming when I first came here - but it really doesn't need to be. While I patiently wait for my ncix/newegg shipments to arrive in the mail over the next few days I thought I'd put together some info for people, like me, who are just starting out. This is no substitute for the info over to your right in the sidebar - just a few things that I think are good to know from the start and/or weren't obvious to me at first. 

* **Read the links in the sidebar.** Seriously. I found all the info a bit overwhelming at first too but even if you don't absorb everything on the first read thru the [BaPC Beginner's Guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/f3efg) and the [Logical Increments Buying Guide](http://s1002.photobucket.com/albums/af150/The_FalconO6/CurrentLogicalPCBuyingGuide/?action=view&amp;current=Guide.png) are your friends. You'll refer back to them often as you go.

* **PCpartpicker will only list parts compatible with what you've already added to your system.** I believe there are some small exceptions here (like cases that are too small for the graphics card) but once you have your build ready the friendly folks at BaPC are usually quite happy to help point stuff like this out. And you can always do a final sanity check before you start buying. But for the most part you can stop stressing the compatibilty issue by using pcpartpicker.

* **Decide on an AMD CPU or an Intel CPU before you start worrying about your other components.** In truth, both are good and you probably can't make a ""wrong"" decision  - but one is likely going to be a better fit for your needs. From what I've read (and guys, please correct me if I'm wrong here) AMD is generally a bit more budget friendly while Intel is generally a bit more ginchy. However, with various sales, price drops, etc, this may or may not be the case when you're ready to start buying for your build.

* **Decide on your overall budget early.** Once that's done you can determine how much of said budget you're going to need to allocate to each component. Don't depend on possible upcoming sales or deals...the best time to buy something will always be a few months after you bought it. Seriously, I watched my HDD go on sale a mere day after purchasing. I can't get a pricematch but I take (a little) solace in the fact I stayed within budget for that piece. Hardware is always being improved and prices will always fluxuate, but you will drive yourself crazy trying to get the rock bottom price on every component.

* **Most people recommend using a standard ATX mobo for your first build.** Sure, tiny cases are cute but they'll require a microATX board which won't always offer as many features. If in doubt on what to get, I'd go for the standard ATX.

* **Someone has likely already done your build here in BaPC.** Read through old threads and the comments in them. Not every commenter is an expert so don't rely solely on the opinions of one or two people. At the same time, you'll get a lot of good info reading through other ideas/suggestions in builds similar to yours.

* **A thought on PSU's:** modular PSU's are recommended but not an absolute requirement. To put it simply; non modular psu's have permanent cables, while modular psu cables are detachable. A modular PSU will help with cable management and airflow, among other things. But non modular is generally less expensive. If you're on a tight budget it's better to go with a **good** non-modular psu than a crappy modular one.

* **Don't pick a case just because it looks cool** or because you have an old one sitting around somewhere. Cases are important and should last you through many builds if you do your homework. 

* **Read the links in the sidebar. Again.** That info was a lot to take in at first, but now that you've started piecing together your system it's time to go back and re-read through the finer points.

* **Have fun!** Seriously, I spent a lot of time stressing over ""How do I learn everything?? I don't want to spend all this money just to screw up!"" Eventually I relaxed enough to realize that learning about the process is at least as fun as most of the threads on r/funny. Spend some time going over the info in the sidebar and you'll be surprised at how quickly you pick things up. Soon you'll be boring all your non-tecchie friends with dissertations on the importance of good cable management and sneering and the price of their new *Dell gaming system.* Take a breath and remember...you're going to be building your own rig. That's right, **you.** You're a fucking **titan,** man.

If I've misstated anything, hopefully my fellow BaPC'ers will chime in. In fact, I'm sure they will, because **they are awesome** like that.

With the blessing of the mods, I have taken the liberty of creating a folding@home team for this subreddit. For those already folding who would like to contribute, the team number is 225055. For those of you not folding yet, here's a little background.

Folding@Home was created by scientists at Stanford University as a way to develop cures for diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's, and many types of cancer. Basically, what it does is utilize donated computer power to study how proteins are manipulated or ""folded,"" which gives insight into how these devastating disease work. With this knowledge, scientists are able to research more effective cures.

Folding sends your computer a set of calculations to compute. Once your system finishes the calculations, it sends the results back to the Folding@Home servers and receives a new set of calculations. With the Folding@Home program, the more computing power available the better. If the client detects that you have a lot of computing power available, it will send your computer a more complex calculation than if it detects that you have a weaker system. Therefore, more powerful computers are better.

Everyday I see people post completed builds with significant amounts of computing power available. If this power could be harnessed and put towards folding, a lot of good could be accomplished.

**UPDATE (Monday, March 26 @ 12:40pm GMT):**

* Ran the Prime95 Torture Test for over **10 hours** yesterday after waking the computer up, while looping TWO Youtube clips on EndlessYoutube.com the entire time, and while using the computer normally throughout the day, and had NO errors.  These are the CPU stats towards the end of the Torture Test: [http://i.imgur.com/VQm4i.png](http://i.imgur.com/VQm4i.png)  
I think it's safe to say the CPU is fine.
* The above, coupled with the earlier [Memtest Results](http://i.imgur.com/M5r9y.jpg) seem to show that both the CPU and RAM are fine.
* I've enabled XMP in the BIOS and my RAM is now running at its intended clock speed of 1600 Mhz.
* Since enabling XMP, my SSD and Graphics benchmarks have improved (no idea if related, or just coincidence, but happy either way).  Furthermore, I also did a “Performance Optimization” using the Samsung 830 Magician Software and now my SSD speeds are **exactly** where they should be across-the-board
* * **New SSD Scores:**  [http://i.imgur.com/j05cu.png](http://i.imgur.com/j05cu.png)  (almost identical to what [ac1115](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamingpc/comments/rbu6a/build_complete_please_help_3000_rig_firsttime/c44l5lk?context=3) scored on [his Samsung 830](http://i.imgur.com/PqsfP.png)).
* * **New Graphics Scores:**  [http://i.imgur.com/FfwUD.png](http://i.imgur.com/FfwUD.png) (P7419, nice improvement, have been advised elsewhere that the 3dMark scores are compared against other cards, **including Overclocked Cards and GPU’s**, which is why 3dMark is reporting my results as ""low"" since everything of mine is at stock speed.
* I left the computer asleep overnight (remember, before the BIOS update, it wouldn’t wakeup or respond after an overnight sleep) and it woke up without a hitch.  
* Computer has not frozen at all since I updated the BIOS early yesterday (not even during the simultaneous Prime95 Torture Test, 2 Endless Youtube clips, and the 3dMark benchmarking).

All in all, it looks like everything is normal now and working as it should, which is a HUGE relief for me.  What my inexperienced mind first thought were multiple hardware failures was simply an outdated BIOS firmware and lack of optimization.  I didn’t even have to open my case to get everything working like it should.  

**Moral of the Story:  ALWAYS update your BIOS to the latest firmware when you build a new PC.  I learned the hard way, but you don’t have to! :)**

I can finally begin to enjoy my creation, and that is a wonderful feeling.  Thanks again for everyone's help, you’ve all been great and made this a lot less painful than it otherwise would have been.  I'm very glad this type of support for newbies exists otherwise I would have been drowning alone in a sea of silicon.

If anything else happens, I’ll report back, but I’m happy to say this will not be the last PC I build.

Eight short months ago I created this account and began a career of professional redditing. I've been very fortunate to meet a lot of awesome people and even had an Admin reach out to me to discuss our new approach to community relations. Not to mention I was literally being paid to be on reddit.

Well the time has come that my responsibilities, both in product development and community relations, have grown outside my capability to properly show each the attention they each require. So starting today, I will no longer be the active representative on duty for reddit, or any other communities. I will now solely be involved in product development. You can still pretty much bet that I will still be on here night and day though because... well... which of you with access to an internet connection at work/home don't end up checking out BuildAPC? In another words, I did not spend my time here because I was being paid. I was lucky enough to be paid for something I enjoy doing. So I'll still be around :).

All that said, at this time I would like to introduce Jason ([XNineOfNZXT](http://www.reddit.com/user/XNineOfNZXT/)). He was my personal choice for a replacement, he's a little new to reddit but I confident he will do well. I request that you contact him from this point on for service requests and general issues relating to problems.

So, after spending an inordinate amount of time typing this message, I must get back to work.

Cya when I get home. :)

Hello /r/buildapc!

First off, before you begin scrutinizing, what I intended to be a 'high-end' gaming build, for my choice of using the z77 chipset, please note that I didn't intend on buying two separate cards from the get-go! When I began assembling this build, my goal was to overclock a core i7 3770k (as I had read about it's somewhat reasonable overclock-ability, and wanted to have thunderbolt connectivity) with a beefy overclock, watercooled, and a SINGLE GTX Titan (which was set to release right around the time this build would have been completed).

In the mix of things, I ended up purchasing two 580's just to see what the performance of those cards in SLI would be like. I had no idea that z77 only had 16 actual PCI lanes though!!! Had I known this before, I definitely would have gone with the x79 chipset to get a full 40 lanes. Now that I've invested in this tech, doesn't seem like there's much else I can do except for keeping on!

Then I was posed with the question of whether I should buy a single GTX titan or SLI two 680's, and after reviewing the benchmarks (on both z77 and x79 chipsets), I decided that the SLI 680's would probably be best for me!

Anyways here are PICTURES: http://imgur.com/a/xmzmn
(These are pictures of my initial build with the GTX 580's, which I tested with 3D Mark 11 and stress tested a little with a slight overclock. All-in-all, I was impressed with its ability to overclock, but seemed a bit too laggy in multiple monitor gaming)

AND MOAR PICTURES: http://imgur.com/a/EKJ6r
(These are pictures of the completed build, completed battlestation, and some preliminary OC's)

Anyways, back to the PCIE 3.0 lanes issue I stated..

So being the overly impatient goof that I am, I didn't check the arrangement to insert my dual GTX 680's into the MVE mobo, and placed them in the red slots, namely slots 1 and 2B.

I didn't realize the second card was going into 2B, which is not the recommended slot for running two cards. The mobo guide states that dual SLI cards must be placed in slots 1 (the top-most red one) and slot 2A (the black PCI slot).

WTF?!?!? Who the hell would guess that?!? If anyone owns this motherboard and knows what I'm talking about will know that it's suggested this way, dual SLI in slots 1 and 2B, because this arrangement allows x8/x8 bandwidth. Well I started worrying about how my cards were running, so I went and took a looksy in the BIOS and this is what I found (a whole lotta wut): http://imgur.com/y3G0jza

Anyways, I've been stress testing the CPU OC all day today (and trying to find a stable OC), so I haven't run too many GPU stress tests, but I'll upload results if it'll help anyone help me determine whether this is bad, or if virtual lanes will make do and won't cause too much of a hassle!

I absolutely love this machine! I use it primarily for gaming and streaming. I know I'll probably get some flak for using a closed loop cooling system with a single width rad, but I liked the look of the Antec setup, and I get 65-70C under full load with prime95 @ 4.2ghz OC.

There's no optical drive in the build because I have an external DVD drive so I just used that, works great and I have no need to ever open the front door of my case. No SSD as budget wouldn't allow it, but I'm supremely happy at how fast everything is even with a standard HDD.

My hands don't work very well at all so building this had it's difficulties for me, namely getting the heavy GPU into place safely and trying to cable manage. This is something I've been wanting to do for the past 5 years or so and I finally gained the confidence (and the money) to give it a go. I wouldn't have been able to do this without the knowledge I gained here from /r/Buildapc, so thank you all so much!

It's less complicated than you think.",348,84,83,http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/1hl6c4/if_you_are_doing_a_build_with_haswell_you_dont/,"There has been a lot of confusion as to which power supplies are compatible with the 4th generation Intel Core processors. The confusion lies with Intel's new C-State technology, which allows the processors to use extremely low voltages when they are on standby. Some older power supplies that are not ""Haswell Certified"" can run into some issues when coming out of a low power state.

&gt;""Even if the sleeping CPU is the only load on the +12V rail, most power supplies can handle a load this low. The potential problem comes up when there is still a substantial load on the power supply's non-primary rails (the +3.3V and +5V). If the load on these non-primary rails are above a certain threshold (which varies by PSU), the +12V can go out of spec (voltages greater than +12.6V). If the +12V is out of spec when the motherboard comes out of the sleep state, the PSU's protection may prevent the PSU from running and will cause the power supply to ""latch off"". This will require the user to cycle the power on their power supply using the power switch on the back of the unit.""

This, however, can be easily solved. I recently did a build with an i5-4670 powered by a Cooler Master Silent Pro M 700W. This power supply is not ""Haswell Certified,"" but I was able to get it to work with the 4th gen processor by disabling the Intel C-State feature in the motherboard bios (MSI Z87-G45). This basically makes the processor run like a 3rd gen would as far as power consumption goes. This is not a problem because CPU power consumption is not as much of an issue on desktops, as opposed to laptops and ultrabooks. 

I have been running the system for a month and it has been completely stable, coming in and out of sleep mode instantly. This proves that you DO NOT need a ""Haswell Certified"" PSU to power a Haswell processor. However, you DO need a motherboard that allows you to disable Intel C-State (I would recommend any Z87 motherboard). 

I hope that this helps clear up any confusion around Haswell power supply comparability,  and it might even save you a few extra bucks on a PSU.

Some of you may remember me from [those CES posts](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/16i0i8/update_rbuildapc_ill_be_talking_to_all_the_major/), where I collected and answered several questions from you all during CES.

Our small team recently joined nVidia for a press conference that officially revealed the GTX 780 specs, release date, and price-point; in addition to this, nVidia turned a few heads with the announcement of ShadowPlay, which is lightweight video capture software that can effectively retroactively record gameplay footage. They also focused on GeForce Experience and driver updates, the TLDR of which is ""gamers don't want drivers after day one - they don't care anymore.""

And of course, we also received finalized and confirmed information about the GTX 780.

- You can find [my article discussing ShadowPlay, the GTX 780, and GFE here](http://www.gamersnexus.net/news-pc/1119-nvidia-shadowplay-gtx780-specs). There is also an nvidia-run benchmark vs. the 7970; this is conducted by nvidia, mind you, so take it with a grain of salt.


If there are any questions unanswered, please ask below and I'll do my best to answer what I'm allowed to.

Pertinent info on the 780:

- $649 MSRP
- May 23 launch.
- Only nVidia reference boards will be available for purchase for about the first month. Board partners will begin shipping their products within about 30 days, which I would imagine will have better cooling and a lower price-point.

This is my old school looking HTPC build that I just completed. The ultimate goal was to have the computer blend in with its surroundings. It’s not a high-end or expensive PC by any means but it’s plenty for what I use it for. I am running Windows Server 2008 R2 and I run two media servers on it: PlayOn and Twonky Server. I use Twonky for streaming local media and PlayOn for Hulu and other random channels. I used liquid cooling because I wanted to maintain the completely stock look of the case but still have quiet and consistent cooling. I harvested a lot of the parts from a previous HTPC build but originally I spent in between $200-$300. Parts list:


CPU:  AMD Athlon X2 255 3.10 GHz

Liquid Cooling:  Zalman LQ-310 Water Cooler

Motherboard:  MSI 880GM-E43

RAM:  4GB G.SKILL Ripjaws DDR3 1600

PSU:  Thermaltake TR2 W0070 430W ATX 12V

Case:  JVC Cassette Stereo


I really had a lot of fun with this build so feel free to ask any questions and thanks for looking!

1344201541.0,268,self.buildapc,xqb23,Some critical details on the importance of a quality power supply (PSU) in your new build.,326,58,212,http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/xqb23/some_critical_details_on_the_importance_of_a/,"I keep seeing a LOT of new people building custom rigs and they pick out decent or even high quality components, then they go and pick out a cheap power supply.  I thought this should be an important note and there is a lot of information on what you should look for.  The power supply is equatable to the human heart.  If you get a bad heart, you're gonna have problems everywhere.

I realize there is already a PSU guide on the right side, but the way it is detailed out loses some key points in the wall-o-text.

What makes a power supply different aside from wattage and specs?  THE QUALITY OF THE COMPONENTS.  Inside a power supply are a lot of capacitors and solder connections.  Cheap power supplies use cheap capacitors and tend to use a low quality solder.  This ultimately means your power supply will die prematurely, and most likely not provide the power output it claims to on its spec sheet.

*  More wattage does not mean its a better power supply.  Do not cheap out on your power supply.  You will get better performance, reliability, and ultimately a longer lifespan with a good quality power supply.  *Less problems!*

* A 500 Watt power supply sometimes means it peaks at 500 watts, but may provide less power continuously.  Reputable companies most often list their wattage at continuous power, which is ideal.  You need to look at the *CONTINUOUS OUTPUT* of your power supply rating.  Higher end power supplies will provide a better continuous output than a cheaper one and will list their specifications based on this rating.  **Don't be fooled by the numbers!**

* A good power supply will have an *Efficiency rating* at or above 85%


* [Calculate out your needs](http://www.extreme.outervision.com/psucalculatorlite.jsp) in terms of wattage.  If you plan to add components later, give yourself some room for expansion in your calculator.

*  **Total Amperage Available on the +12V Rail(s) is the most important, followed by the +5V amperage and then the +3.3V amperage.**
  
*  A post from Simmo1404 suggests that it is important to remember that cheaper power supplies may often have cheaper fans, which may be louder, more prone to fail, may vibrate, or be less efficient at moving air.  Not all fans are created equal and cheaper ones may fail more easily and burn up the PSU with it.

* It has been notably mentioned that some ""no-name"" brand power supplies are in fact manufactured by high-end companies.  But, I would like to point out that the company you buy it from is also important in that you may have to deal with them for warranty issues.  I still recommend sticking with a trusted brand.  Look through the comments below to see some recommendations by readers.  *You can find a more comprehensive [document about power supplies and who makes what in this Tom's Hardware review on power supplies.](http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/psu-manufacturer-oem,2729-2.html)*

**I cannot possibly emphasize enough the importance of a good power supply in your system.**  A good quality power supply will last you 7-8 years before the parts start to break down.  Most likely you will outgrow the power supply before it ever fails.  *Most importantly though, a good quality power supply will protect your internal components as well as provide them the steady power they need.*

If it's not kosher, please let me know and I'll put it elsewhere. buildapc seemed to be the logical place for it.

I've been thinking about if there is a business model for this community. I figure the builders here represent a wide geographic area and all of you like to build. Some of your are experienced. Some of you are novices. Lots of people out there in the world want new computers that provide a nice bang for their buck.

What about a centralized resource where people could put in the specs they want (e.g. GAMING/HTPC/BEAST/GENERAL USE/ETC.), the budget they can afford, and the area they are in.

BuildAPC people could register on the site to be notified about requests in their geographic or knowledge area and claim the 'tickets' to do the build.

They would then take the req, propose a build, and if accepted by the buyer, build and deliver it.

Buyers could rate builders on speed, reliability, friendliness, etc.

Builders could tack on whatever margin they want. Say it's a $500 build, they could charge $600 and pocket the change. And still offer a very competitive build.

**edit**: Every single comment in here is awesome. Great ideas. Great feedback. As a side note it reminds of the super high quality you get when you move away from frontpage. Thanks one and all! I've got a couple ideas. FYI you guys will appreciate that the the domain camper on buildapc.com wants $29,000 for the domain, despite doing feckall with it.

I thought it might be a nice way to allow builders to build when they want and make a little extra money. People could dip in and out or, if there was demand, do it as much as they wanted.

Just an idea. Wanted to see what you guys thought.

**edit 2**: Thank you one and all for this constructive, insightful, savvy, feedback. As someone who was in their 2nd year of university before the 'web' even existed, I am still, 20 years later, impressed by how well it works for the exchange of ideas. It's not all kittens and porn.

Started building in June of last year, with a Source 210, 3570K, and a GTX 670... but I wasn't happy with that. Browsing /r/gamingpc is bad for my bank account, clearly. 10 months later, here I am with this monstrosity, and this time I'm quite happy with it. There are a few more changes in the cards for this build, including custom made backplates from dwood http://www.triptcc.com for the 7970s, cable sewing the PCI and 24-pin power cables, and a real 5.25""=&gt;3.5"" converter for the HDD that's up in the external drive bays, but this is close enough to completed that I'm willing to post it. 

After shipping, this probably cost closer to 3950 (multiple orders, expedited shipping, so on and so forth). But here is the PCPartpicker list. The prices are all edited to reflect what I actually paid for each item.

After using my MacBook Pro for a couple of years, I've decided that I don't move it around enough to merit having a portable system. I also thought it would be a fun project to build a PC, as I haven't since I was like 9 years old. I really couldn't find a case that I liked (since I am a sucker for the Apple aesthetic). I was able to find an old PowerMac G5 for under $150, so it seemed like a no-brainer to buy that and mod the case. While it turned into a lot tougher of a project than I had originally expected, I am very happy with the outcome. Here's the parts list:

Since it's going to be primarily for graphic design and photography work, having a crazy-good graphics card was not a huge priority for me. I needed something that wasn't crap to run the two 2560x1600 displays, but other than that, gaming performance isn't a huge deal to me. Sure, I'll play a game of Starcraft or two occasionally, but it's not a gaming rig. The current drive setup I have in the system is the Samsung 840 for boot and the WD Blue 1tb for my 'working' data. The two Greens are in a RAID 1 Mirror, so that's where I store my Time Machine backups and all my *ahem* acquired movies and tv shows.

A major constraint I had on building the system was OSX compatibility. I know most of you are Windows users, but that's not really an option for me at this point. I'm going to have a Windows partition installed, but I've invested a ton in Mac software for work and I don't want to have to re-buy all that. The Windows installation will be for any games that I can't play on OSX (Read: Bioshock Infinite, Mass Effect) and maybe some 3D Rendering.

After the whole process, I've got some things that I'm really happy with, some things that I'm less happy with and a list of ToDo's for the future.

**Good**

 - A really fun project. I really took my time with it, so was able to really make everything as perfect as I could, without a time crunch of needing a new computer for work.
 - So far, it's been wicked fast. Having all the internal storage is very nice.
 - The watercooling loop was a lot easier to assemble and bleed than I was anticipating.
 - Very quiet. That's one thing I was unhappy with about my MacBook Pro, was when I was doing serious work on it, it got pretty loud. Not so with this beastie.
 - Should be pretty future-proofed for the kind of stuff I need. Hopefully I won't need to make any serious modifications for the next couple years.


**Not so Good**

 - Getting all the drives in place was a MASSIVE pain in the ass and, unfortunately, there was no real way around that. They're all in place and I'll be praying that I don't have to remove any of time for quite some time. If you're looking for a mental image of how this was, imagine trying to thread a needle, when you can't see the needle or the thread, and you're trying to do the whole thing in a box full of knives. Not fun.

 - Due to Apple's stupid design on the front panel, the Ground for board runs through the now defunct FireWire port. Since my mATX board didn't have a firewire header, I had to buy a PCIE card that had an internal header. While this works, it's kind of annoying.
 - Due to the case design, cable management was really hard. Next time, I'd probably detach the back side from the case and make a false back, as many cases do. That would make the whole process about a million times easier.

**ToDo's**

 - I'd like to try making a jumper cable to solve the FireWire Ground issue. That way, I can get rid of the card, since I don't really have  a use for it.

 - The GPU power still needs to be sleeved. Not terribly difficult, just something I don't really want to deal with at the moment.

Other than those things, the system has been a more rewarding project than I've done in a long time. My two monitors should be showing up later today, so I'll post some pics of my setup, which will be far more fun than studying for finals (as I should be doing.) Thanks for reading all the way through... I know it was long :)

The [recently proposed standard build sheets](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/myg5g/can_we_make_standard_favorite_reddit_computer/) is a great idea.  However, I think both concepts have limitations, and I'd like to propose an alternative that I think addresses those limitations.

**PCPartPicker will buy, assemble, and comprehensively benchmark a variety of builds each month.  This benchmark data will be combined with live pricing data, and will be made available on the site in an easily sortable and searchable manner.**  As the inventory of parts increases month to month, I will mix and match components among builds to further flesh out the benchmark data and fill in obvious gaps in coverage.

The main limitation of standard build sheets and the Logical Increments guide is that a limited set of builds cannot easily take many application-specific needs into account.  Having a diverse set of benchmarks run on many part combinations with up-to-date pricing data solves this problem.

Want to know what build gives you the best price vs. performance for game X or application Y?  No problem - I'll show you what various combinations of components scored on each, allow you to sort by budget, filter based on benchmark, etc.  Let's say you will also be able to graph price vs. performance of a host of builds for the benchmark of your choice.

As pricing data changes daily, the data will automatically be kept up to date as well.  And as new hardware becomes available, I'll add it to the inventory, benchmark it, and add the results to the database.  If you're looking to upgrade, this can give you real-world data that will help you decide whether it is worth upgrading a particular component.  

Where I need help from you is choosing what parts and combinations to benchmark.  I will take the proposed builds and feedback from this subreddit and use that to drive what parts are bought, what systems are built, and what benchmarks are run.

If this idea gains traction, and if the mods approve, I will start a separate post soliciting builds from you all.  I will choose based on voting and my discretion which builds to start with (i.e. I can't afford to build several $10000 systems even if they get all the votes...)

1368415359.0,261,self.buildapc,1e8226,"[Discussion] AMD's ""Module"" Architecture: The FX 8350 is not a Quad-Core.",313,52,260,http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/1e8226/discussion_amds_module_architecture_the_fx_8350/,"**A Guide to AMD’s “Module” Microarchitecture**
-

Okay. There’s confusion on BaPC about AMD’s CPU microarchitecture, introduced with products codenamed “Bulldozer.” For example, the FX 8350: “It’s a quad-core.” “It’s an 8-core.” “It’s a quad-core with hyper-threading.” There’s a lot of confusion and misinformation out there on the topic. I hope to dispel some of it here.

*Disclaimer: I am not a computer microarchitecture engineer. I do not claim to understand the low-level intricacies of CPU design. I do, however, consider myself sufficiently knowledgeable to comment on the high-level design aspects of Bulldozer microarchitecture. I’ve been following it since before it was released, so there’s that.*

**Bulldozer**

Bulldozer is AMD’s recent, “radically” different microarchitecture first released in 2011 with new-generation FX (code-named Zambezi) and Opteron (code-named Interlagos and Valencia) processors. Its successors Piledriver, and eventually Steamroller and Excavator, are based on the foundation laid by Bulldozer. Since they are based on the first-generation Bulldozer, much of what I say here can be applied to the current Piledriver-based Vishera FX CPUs.

Bulldozer differs from a “traditional” core microarchitecture in that it pairs cores together in “modules” to share several key features of a traditional core. [Here is a basic high level look at the BD architecture.](http://i.imgur.com/NgBdlEE.jpg)

This is what AMD calls a module. A module is recognized as two logical cores by the operating system. In a patch released for Windows 7 and by default in Windows 8, Windows recognizes Bulldozer-based CPUs as 4-core/8-thread CPUs. This has to do with how the operating schedules tasks on the CPU. More on this later. What’s important right now is that the two cores within a module share certain resources. Why? Mostly because it makes the CPU cheaper.

**What’s Not Shared**

The module contains two “traditional” integer cores, each with its own scheduler and L1 data cache. This is partly where AMD gets away with calling their 8350 an 8-core CPU. Why have 2 integer cores in a module? First, they take up minimal extra die space. About 5% extra space on silicon. Second, AMD anticipated CPUs being tasked primarily with integer calculations and GPGPU cores tasked primarily with highly paralleled floating point arithmetic. I put “traditional” in quotes because it can be argued that there is no such thing as a “traditional” core. CPU cores are constantly evolving and at some level still share resources.

**The FPU**

The reason some people like to call the 8350 a ""pseudo 8 core"" processor lies mostly with its floating point unit(s). A Bulldozer module has *two* 128-bit FPUs that can be paired to carry out 256-bit AVX instructions (the second key to it being an 8-core CPU). Each modern Intel CPU core has its own 256-bit wide FPU. AMD made a bet that floating point calculations would not be essential to strong CPU performance in the long run, with Bulldozer being at the center of their planned Heterogeneous System Architecture.

**Other Shared Bits**

The module’s cores, in addition to the shared FPU, share L1 instruction cache, fetch, decode, and L2 cache. Once again, a big reason for this was to minimize cost while the engineers anticipated minimal performance loss from this design. Fetch and decode have been at the center of some debate on Bulldozer’s performance and even the subject of AMD roadmaps, where they advertise “feed the cores faster” on slides detailing future microarchitecture updates, likely giving each core its own set of fetch, decode, and L1 instruction cache.

**It’s Not Hyperthreading (Neither is HyperTransport)**

This is a big one. Modules are *not* like Hyperthreading. These modules are *not* dual-threaded cores, they are CPU building blocks that have two cores inside them. Hyperthreading works by taking the resources of a *single* core and running two threads through it, and each thread takes a significant hit to performance compared to if they were executed on separate cores.

*Also, HyperTransport, advertised by AMD as a feature in Phenom, Athlon, and FX CPU platforms, is not akin to Hyperthreading. HyperTransport is a bus used by the CPU to communicate with the Northbridge. Nothing more.*

**Windows 8 and the W7 Patch**

After the release of the Zambezi FX processors, it was noted that loading unrelated threads on both cores of the same module could yield reduced performance compared to using a core from a different module for each thread. So instead of assigning tasks sequentially (0-&gt;1-&gt;2-&gt;3-&gt;4...) the Windows scheduler assigns unrelated tasks as if it were a processor made up of half as many cores first, then loads the second core of each module (0-&gt;2-&gt;4-&gt;6-&gt;1-&gt;3...). It essentially treats the CPU like an Intel CPU with Hyperthreading to eek out ~5% more performance in multithreaded tasks that only use up to half the CPU cores. This does not mean the 8350 is a quad-core, but this is why programs like Cinebench show the 8350 as a 4C/8T CPU.

I've done a lot of google-fu but all I can come up with is conjecture from other people who may or may not understand what they're talking about. Finding authoritative information on the matter seems difficult.

Skipping all of the technical jargon, here's the essence of my question: How can you determine when PCI-E Lane availability will bottleneck your graphics performance?

ie: If I want to build a PC with dual GPU's (SLI or crossfire) and I'm running a 144hz monitor at a resolution &gt;1920x1080, or I'm using a multi-monitor set-up, at which point will having only 24 lanes available to me bottleneck my set-up?

Is it worth it to invest in these 3-4 GPU motherboards that have chips on the mobos to add additional PCI-E slots (to allow for x16/x16 rather than x8/x8)? How do those chips even add more PCI-E lanes if the processor only has 24 lanes available? Can the chipset itself deal with that on its own or what?

Sorry if I'm mixing/confusing stuff up, I haven't delved too deeply into the availability of lanes to a PC as I've never really worried about it before.

Just put together this guy after work today! Been collecting things over the last 5 or so months. 

I originally saw this HP case at work, it was holding up a box fan in our server room for god knows how long. When I checked it out, I saw that it wasn't proprietary which I thought was pretty cool so I tossed it in my trunk. Also got all the sata cables and zipties from work too :)

I won the PSU at a local LAN center. It's nothing special, but it will work for the time being. 

Got 2 500gb HD's and the DVD drive from a computer I saw sitting out for trash.

The 120GB SSD came from one of my nicest friends ever (RIP Charles)

I got the mobo damaged for free off craigslist. It just needed some new solder so I had someone at work do magic.

The GPU is a MSI GTX 560-TI 446 Cuda. This also came for free off craigslist for giving somebody a ride to the beach with me! I gotta say, not something I typically do but when I saw what he was offering, and I was going there anyway.... Had to have it! :D

No cool story for the CPU.... Its just a Phenom II 945 that I had in the basement. Still looking for a 8350 :D

I decided on AMD for numerous reasons. While I like Intel, it just isn't the best option in my case.

1. Price/performance
2. The 8320 came with 3 games
3. More cores, hopefully games will become better optimized.
4. Socket AM3+.

Now, I was originally going to go with a Xigmatek Gaia on an FX-6300, but for 40$ more (10$ more if I got the 6300 with the cooler) I got a better CPU and 3 games. Plus, I can always buy a cooler later on.


 How did I get 3 games? At Canada Computers, I remember seeing a bundle with the 8 core AMD CPU's coming with FC3. I noticed that the offer wasn't available when I went to go pick everything up, so I asked. The workers there were fantastic and offered me last year's Never Settle, including Hitman Absolution, Sleeping Dogs and Far Cry 3. Moral of the story, always argue!

So, let's go through the parts, shall we?

**CPU**: Price per performance, AM3+, and I wanted to do something different from the i5 norm.

**Cooler**: Used stock here to save a little bit of cash. Still, from my experience, quieter than Intel's stock, but still a little loud for me, even with the R4. Makes a very discrete hum when on full blast, but nothing like the people of BaPC explain it. Overall, I'm happy with it, but want to upgrade soon.

**Mobo**: This motherboard is *fantastic*. I would recommend this to anyone looking for an AM3+ build, everything about it is solid, not to mention the awesome colour scheme!

**RAM**: Corsair Vengeance, what can I say. Stays cool and is low profile. Looks nice as well.

**GPU**: Now, I was originally going to go with the Gigabyte 7950, but it was 70$ more. I was eyeballing the Sapphire 7870XT for a while, but it was always out of stock! I noticed out of the corner of my eye, in store, the [little ""XT""] (http://memextreme.com/wp-content/gallery/meme-faces-l/surprised-rainbow-face-l.png). Snagged it for 250$. Runs silent, cool and looks good. Good buy.

**Wireless Adapter**: I unfortunately couldn't route an Ethernet cable, so I had to go with wireless. I had a 45$ Best Buy gift card lying around and decided what better way to spend it, right? I bought it for 50$, only spent 5$ on it so whatever, it's fast enough and has little ears.

**Case**: Need I even explain? Just look at it! Now, not for some, but I *loooooveee* the looks of it. It's quiet, cool and minimal. Plus, the window is a nice little feature and lets me peek at my parts. The fan controller works wonders, makes a difference of ~5* from minimum to maximum and runs quietly, although the difference between 7V and 5V is very slim. Everything is *solid*, like the Mercedes of cases. I was expecting its weakest part to be the door, but not one bit, in fact, the door seems to be the best-constructed part of the case. The case only comes with two fans, but they're 140mm and very quiet, so no complaints. I plan on adding more later on, and the case supports fan speeds for three fans.

**HDD**: Had a 500gb 7200rpm lying around, recycled it for this build until I can buy a 1tb drive, and later on an SSD.

**PSU**: (Note that the said PSU isn't on PPP, I picked the most similar one.) I was always undecided on the PSU. I knew I wanted modular, and I knew I wanted it to look good. So, when I saw this PSU on *sale* for 110$, I couldn't resist. Only two cables are non-modular, and those are the 24pin and the CPU power, both of which are required so no biggie. The cables are all very nice and long, so that's great. The fan is silent, and since the PSU is so efficient, the fans don't even spin when on low loads. It's gold rated, very nice. Now, I do have one con, and that's the chirping. I hate to admit it, [but the PSU chirps every so often] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9RLln5g2VI). It's quiet and happens rarely, but still, an annoyance. I don't think I'll RMA as it's not that big of a deal for me.

**Mouse**: For the love of god, if you haven't tried it out already, do so. It's the best mouse I've ever owned/tried. All of the buttons are *solid* and responsive. Weights, nice scroll wheel, no cons. Good grip, too.

**Mousepad**: *HHHNNNNNGGGGGHHHH.* This thing is FANTASTIC! Smooth, aluminum surface, big, everything I'll ever need. Looks great and has a brushed metal look. Only con I can think of is it does get a little cold in Canadian mornings.

**Keyboard**: Still waiting on the good ol' Quickfire Stealth this month. For now, creaky old Compaq dome.

**Monitor**: Again, saving up for a 24"" 1080p monitor. For now my 21,5"" 1600x900 will do, I guess.

**Win7**: Had a copy lying around.



I payed around ~910$ for everything, excluding HDD, OS and monitor. Fantastic value if I do say so myself.


I was monitoring temperatures during sessions of gaming. In BF3 on a 64 man server, with fans on 12V, the max GPU temp was 61 and CPU was 46. CPU Idles at 30 and the GPU idles at 31. 

**Mistakes made during the build**:

-Forgot to plug in HDD power cable

-couldn't use old optical drive

-forgot to plug in optical drive power cable

When I turned the PC off on my first mistake, I hit off on the PSU, then heard a loud ***POP***, you know, like a popped balloon or tire. I thought I killed my power supply. I was crying puddles, all this work and I just blow my PSU? My heart was racing, I thought I was screwed. Until I realized it was just my case door that had closed by itself.

I also had a hard time with the motherboard standoffs. The R4 came with these rubber washers for the standoffs, and 12 were included, but I only had 9 standoffs. I figured that they were used to sandwich the motherboard, but decided not to use them for grounding purposes. It was a real head-scratcher but it's all good.

I really have nothing bad to say about this build. *Most* things worked out in my favor and it was a great experience. I was a little nervous during certain parts, mainly the CPU, but overall it was a lot of fun, and coming from an old 2.something ghz dual core laptop with no GPU, gaming is phenomenal. I plan on overclocking down the line, but on 1600x900 everything runs buttery smooth on ultra, aliasing and all. I'd like to give a huge thanks to everyone on /r/Buildapc, /r/CableManagement and /r/BaPCSalesCanada. It's funny how something like a subreddit can bring people together and share experiences, you guys are the best, thanks &lt;3

Oh, and if you're wondering about the name, I guess it's old Pokemon nostalgia, mixed with the look of the case.

Also, if I could give any advice for new builders, it's that you take. your. time. There's no need to rush, nobody is waiting. Don't let excitement overcome you and risk screwing something up. Take it slow, and practice good cable management. Also, document your build!

1349243122.0,256,self.buildapc,10v1ql,[Build Complete] 10 Things I Think I Learned About Building a PC,313,57,223,http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/10v1ql/build_complete_10_things_i_think_i_learned_about/,"This is a bit of a long post, so if you just want to see parts and pics, jump to the bottom.

**10 Things I Think I Learned About Building a PC**

10.  There’s no such thing as the “correct” build.  There are definitely ways of choosing and combining parts that make a hell of a lot more sense than other ways, but as long as your PC works and your happy with your choices, then that’s all that matters.  For me, aesthetics and color schemes played a bit more into my parts selection than was probably prudent as a consumer, but I’m happy with how things turned out.

9.  There’s no such thing as a “perfect” build.  There are always going to be better parts that come along and at cheaper prices.  If you wait to buy your parts, you’re always going to be waiting.  And even once you’ve bought your parts, you’re still going to find things you want to make better.  If it’s a hobby and you want to constantly improve and upgrade, great, have at it.  If you’re on a budget, stick to your budget and be happy with your selections.  You don’t really need that heatshrink wrapped quad-channel vapor 7million 2.0…

8.  Zero Insertion Force IS NOT WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE.  Sure, don’t press on the CPU with your finger and bend the pins.  But when you  pull that damn latching mechanism down, it takes some force.  And there’s an awful crunching sound.  Seriously, if you haven’t done it before, it’s not a fun experience.

7.  2011 vs. 1155?  As you’ll see below, I went with the 1155 socket.  But damn did that 2011 tempt me.  The problem is, it increases a lot of other costs- mobos, higher PSU demands, memory, etc.  Seeing as how I’m not planning on upgrading my CPU anytime soon, I’m alright knowing that I’ve locked my upgrade path a bit.  2011 is the way to go if you’re gonna be fiddling and tinkering and tweaking, though.

6.  Get a mobo with error-message LEDs!  I’ve got the Asus P8Z77-V, and when it didn’t post, the error LED told me the RAM was the problem.  A quick Google search let me know the RAM wasn’t seated properly.  Bam, solved.  Would have been a nightmare to solve without those blessed little lights.

5.  You only need 8GB of RAM for gaming.  If you want to do Photoshop or Video Editing, it’s fine to bump that up.  I’ve got 16 GB (2x8).  I read a comment somewhere that 2 sticks are better than 4 when you’re using dual-channel memory.  I could be wrong and I don’t remember the source, I just remember making my selection because of that.

4.  Gaming isn’t really a CPU intensive process.  You don’t need hyper-threading or 6 cores for gaming.  But again, CPU intensive programs like Photoshop benefit from those features.

3.  Your budget on PCPartpicker, depending on taxes and shipping is about 10-25% less than what you’ll probably spend (especially if you start throwing on miscellaneous extras- “oh, I  want to get a PWM fan, it’s only $12.  Oh, and a SD Card Reader, it’s only $18, etc.)

2.  Something is probably going to fuck up- you’ll get a DOA part or the wrong part gets shipped (looking at you, Amazon!).  Order your parts, but don’t have your heart set on having everything arriving and assembled right away.  If there’s any delays, it’ll be easier to handle if you weren’t expecting to be complete for another week or so anyway.

1. This community is awesome and fucking addictive.  Seriously, there are so many helpful links, comments, posts, videos, etc that it made the process of selecting, ordering, and building a PC really, really enjoyable.  If anyone is on the fence about diving in and doing this or not, I can’t recommend it enough.  Give this subreddit a week of your time and you’ll be hooked for life.  Thanks, everyone!

[Anyway, here are the pictures](http://imgur.com/a/YK0M2) (because I want my PC to look like every video game box cover out there)!    And the parts list.  I’m especially pleased with the new Dell S Series IPS monitor.  If you want to talk about why I went with that and not a Korean monitor with a higher res, let me know.

Wanted to build for some time but learning that Dark Souls was getting ported to PC sealed the deal. Overall extremely satisfied with this setup...especially after many years of trying to game on laptops. So far I've been able to run everything I've tried (Skyrim, Metro 2033, Witcher 2, Shogun 2, Just Cause 2) at or near max settings. The fans provided with the case work pretty well and are quiet. The CPU and GPU can get a bit loud, but I like to keep them as cool as possible. 

As for the build, I found cable management with the diablotek case to be difficult, but possible. Everything else fit together without a hitch. My only concern is that the cpu fan sits a bit slant...I'm getting okay temps, so I guess it's fine. 

Thanks for all the help BaPc!

1371157823.0,252,self.buildapc,1galzp,[Build Complete] $150 AMD APU build in an old Dell case.,302,50,51,http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/1galzp/build_complete_150_amd_apu_build_in_an_old_dell/,"So my Grandma needed a new computer, but has an aversion to spending money, meaning she wouldn't spend more than $200 on one. She also wanted it to be quite small, as she doesn't have a lot of room for it. Me, fresh off my first build and thinking I was hot shit, said that I could build her one. I slowly started to realize that I was idiot and the lowest build I had ever seen was around $300. It was at that point that I remembered I had an old [Dell Inspiron 530s](http://www.dell.com/us/dfh/p/inspiron-530s/pd) lying around that had gotten all sorts of shitty, so I decided to cannibalize it as much as possible. I managed to salvage the case, power supply, storage, and optical drive. I bought a new motherboard, APU, and RAM from Microcenter. I love Microcenter a lot.  


Without further ado, here are some [photos of the build](http://imgur.com/a/l94y6).

If I had to do it again I would probably have just bought her a new case and PSU and paid the difference myself. Trying to work with the old Dell case was far more difficult than I thought it would be. First off, the case was a proprietary ""slim"" case, meaning most things were designed for specific Dell parts. I had to cut out part of the back of the case so that the new motherboard would fit into it. While that was fun, it was also a massive pain in the ass trying to find a place where I could do it (I ended up using the shop in my old high school). Additionally, many of the cables (including the front panel USB cable, the case fan power cable, and the front power button cable thing) weren't long enough for the new motherboard, so I had to do some creative breaking of the case to get them to reach, and I ended up buying a extension cable for the fan. But on the bright side it looks cool and was really damn cheap. I'm also really liking the A6-6400K, it's pretty zippy for $80.

**Contest Winners**

Congratulations to all the winners and hope you love your prizes.  

If you're one of the winners, PM the mods your name and shipping address via [modmail](http://en.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fbuildapc).  This is to verify that the shipping information we have for you is complete and/or correct. You will have 5 days to verify this or a new winner will be chosen.

For this contest, each entrant was given one entry.  Some of you accidentally entered multiple times, some intentionally did it with different user names.  If you used multiple user names, you were removed from the contest as per the rules.  If you simply made a mistake or forgot, your later entries were deleted unless they were missing info that the later entry had.  The total number of entrants were then entered into [Random.org's sequence generator](http://www.random.org/sequences/) and the first six numbers were matched to cell numbers.

So, without further ado, our winners:

**Side Story: The Kool Room**

I had ordered my components in three parts. My graphics card came from some shop in another state (it's hard to find reference cards these days). All of my hardware and water cooling components came from PCCaseGear. My dye came from The Kool Room.

Well, after ordering everything on the same day, everything arrived after a week. Everything, that is, except my dye. I contacted the couriers who conducted a search for the missing consignment. At the same time I notified The Kool Room, who also picked up on the situation and inquired their courier service about the issue. Funnily enough, the manager of Kool Room mentioned in that this was **the first consignment their couriers had ever lost**. Unfortunately, he couldn't send me more dye for free since I did not buy parcel protection (true karma right there), but he did pay for shipping and sent me a nice gift in my package (see album). 10/10 service, would buy from again.

___

**FAQ:**

**Q:** What do you use this computer for?  
**A:** Single monitor gaming such as BF3, Far Cry 3, Chivalry, DotA2. I also do video editing and rendering for my job, hence the 16GB RAM and i7 (not that I had much choice with the i7 on LGA2011).

**Q:** Why X79 for a single card setup?  
**A:** Because upgrade path. In my long term plans I want to have a particular triple screen setup (primary 27"" 1440/1600p with two 21"" portraits on either side). I would need a second high end graphics card for this. Yes, I know I'd have to drain my loop in order to add a second card, but that's all part of the experience. Also, I had dealt with nothing but LGA1155 platforms in the past, so I wanted to see what 2011 had to offer. Also, the prices for both platforms were quite similar.

**Q:** Why water?  
**A:** Mostly experience. I wanted something quiet, aesthetically pleasing, and high performance. Water cooling satisfies all criteria.

**Q:** Benchmarks?  
**A:** I'm still working on these. [Here's a Heaven 3.0 result](http://i.imgur.com/3P5D2TH.jpg) I achieved at 1225 core / 1800 mem @ 1280mV. My 3820 is currently sitting at a lazy x43 multiplier with stock voltages. I haven't had much time to fiddle around with everything else in great detail yet.

**Q:** How heavy is your computer?  
**A:** It weighs a fucking tonne.

___

**Problems / Annoyances:**

- My Cougar Vortexes stall on startup if they are set at the lowest speeds via my Sentry Mesh fan controller. I will fix this issue by buying PWM extensions and plugging them into my motherboard. They also rattle a little at high RPM - I'm assuming this is because of their horizontal orientation (I never had rattle issues when they were mounted vertically on my 212 EVO).

- The X2O pump is a little louder than I'm comfortable with. I mean, it's not *loud*, but it's just not dead silent (I'm pedantic like that). I kinda expected this since it's a pump/res combo unit, rather than separate dedicated units. I'm thinking about wiring the molex cable from the pump into the Sentry Mesh fan controller to see if I can control the speeds this way. If anyone has had experience with this before, please let me know. If it doesn't work, I'll probably convert to separate pump/res units if I add a second graphics card.

- The BitFenix orange cable extensions aren't the exact shade of orange I'd like (they're a little dark). I may do some DIY individual sleeving in the future if I'm bored enough.

- The GPU power cables aren't dead straight. Cable braiding will fix this, but first I need to learn how to cable braid. [scudzey pls](http://i.imgur.com/R0xac.jpg)

- My i7-3820 temps are a little higher than I expected them to be. I have already re-seated the CPU block once and gained no temperature drop. The only cause I can think of is the fact that hot water from my graphics card is going straight to the reservoir then to the CPU block. I know it's not an issue with my loop because my 7970 temps are fine (32C idle, 43C load).

___

**Things left to do**

- Orange LED inside the X2O bay pump/res. Might hook all orange LED's up to the button-controlled circuit.

- De-stickering my power supply for a clean black look (kinda scared of voiding warranty)

Thanks for reading the wall of text, please ask any questions you have. Any criticisms are very welcome too. If you live in Australia (east coast) and are interested in buying this PC, please send me a PM :).

Hope you have enjoyed my build!

Apparently the bios on the motherboard, as is, struggle to recognize most modern video cards.  Updating it too 2.70 (the latest driver) will fix this issue.  (Also asRock support doesn't know about this. They will always have you send the motherboard in for repair/replacement).

Also if you're wondering, my bios were 2.50 when I bought the motherboard.  It wouldn't take a 560 or a 660ti until I updated them.  The same can be said about AMD cards as well, I'm guessing.

This is a P.S.A. from a novice PC builder who struggled with this motherboard.  Thank you.

update: minor edits for clarity.  Also, wow I'm amazed how many people are interested in this.  Glad to know everyone here is so supportive of this.

update 2: I had an idea.  Since r/buildapc has tags for build help, build ready, build complete &amp; troubleshooting - why not have a tag for resolved issues.  If a user like me fines an issue and a solution to it - you can mark it with a tag.

After breaking an NES on another project, freeing up the case (and with Black Friday dropping SSD prices), I decided to go for it. After looking over builds on the internet, most recent ones used a mobo with a weak built-in processor, built for emulating old consoles (N64 and below). I was looking to do some current gaming on mine, so I needed more power but still wanted to stay pretty cheap. I went with AMD's recent Trinity APUs since I had no room for a discrete graphics card. Then I had to wait a while until a FM2 mini ITX board was released =p

My two unique additions are a second hard drive and a built-in Xbox wireless gaming receiver. The HDD helped take the pressure of my Steam folder off my SSD. The Big Picture update (and the ability to install games to multiple drives) came out while I was building, so that was great timing. I already have 4 Xbox controllers, so the wireless receiver was a no-brainer, and I wired it up to the reset button on the NES case.

Gaming benchmarks? Luckily my TV is only 720p so the computer doesn't have to pull off 1080p unless I take it somewhere. Deus Ex: Human Revolution (medium settings + AA) and Far Cry 3 (medium settings) ran at a solid 30-35 FPS at 720p, but dropped into the 20s on my 1080p monitor. Team Fortress 2 ran at 50-60 FPS on maximum settings at 1080p, but that isn't exactly graphically intensive. On the emulation side, I was able to get Gamecube and some Wii games running full speed, but I'll need to play around more with that.",,False,,t5_2rnve,1356668881.0,,,True,t3_15k1ew,http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/15k1ew/build_complete_amd_trinitybased_nes_pc/,

Most cables have been sleeved and several more will be after more sleeving arrives.

I installed the light strip around the window a couple of days ago installed the loop today.

The plate with the storage drives is made from an old case panel that I cut, drilled and painted to match the case.

The little blue thing in the slot at the back is the switch I built to turn off the lighting at night.

I also cut the window with my dremel and attached some plexi with mounting tape.

I am leaving for the US in about a month and won't be back for a while. I am a [Youtube partner](http://www.youtube.com/totalhalibut) full-time. I do a lot of live streaming as well as recording and encoding HD gameplay footage of PC titles. I am going to need a new machine for the US which will need to be up and running by early April. Myself and the missus both know how to build PCs and have done so in the past but we're having trouble picking parts, considering Ivy Bridge is just around the corner, as well as having to make assumptions about the 6xx range from Nvidia which rumour has it might land this month.

My current machine can't really come with me to the US but looks something like this.

---------------

Intel 980x @ 3.9ghz

12gb G.Skill Trident DDR3-2000

2x Nvidia Geforce 580gtx in SLI

ASUS Rampage III board

Windows running off a 150gb Intel SSD, I'll be damned if I know which mark, it was a trade sample.

Other drives include a couple of WD Black 1GBs and a WD Green 2gb dump drive as well as various externals.

----------------

I was looking around on PCbuilder and came up with this as a framework. However I have some questions, bearing in mind the following.

* Horsepower is important. It saves time in encoding and improves livestream quality due to being able use more CPU intensive presets. At present on my 980x, any attempt to stream say SC2 in the Xsplit program using ""slow"" x264 presets will utilise almost all available cpu time on all 6 cores. There is a noticeable quality improvement in the stream while doing so. Being able to use slow or perhaps a preset even more intensive than that would be great. Alternatively that CPU power would be going into streaming at 60fps rather than 25-30. I am not sure how intensive that is on the CPU as opposed to upstream, but one has to imagine it would take a bit more oomph than 30. In terms of CPU clout there is no such thing as overkill for what I do, every ounce will get used somewhere, even if it is to the degree where I can game/record other footage while encoding 1080p stuff in Adobe Media Encoder.

* I do not know much about the difference between Sandybridge E and Ivybridge architecture. I have heard Ivybridge is supposed to release in April, I do not know whether the first wave of Ivybridge CPUs would benefit me more than a Sandybridge E cpu. I have also heard that there are issues with the socket the Sandybridge E uses and there is some SSD caching technology that could prove to be a big deal available on another socket.

* Price/performance isn't really a factor. The budget for this machine is around $6000 and is flexible.

* I have overclocked before and intend to do so here, however I am a clutz and do not trust myself with watercooling that is not fully enclosed as it comes out of the box. My last attempt to use watercooling that wasn't resulted in leaks.

* I am currently using a Cosmos case from Coolermaster and I like the fact that it comes pre-sounddampened. This is very useful for recording, because while I need a powerful PC it can't sound like a jet engine or the mics will pick it up.

* I can wait a couple of weeks at most into April before having to build this thing. Any longer than that and... well I am basically self employed and you know what happens when self employed people take holidays.

_______________

Alright, so using PCBuilder here is the framework I've come up with thus far. I am most likely looking to wait on the GPUs until the next gen of Nvidia cards comes out, basing this decision on the assumption that their high end card will be the most powerful on the market. In this case, price/performance is not an important factor, raw power is.

CPU: Intel Core i7 Extreme i7-3960X 3.3GHz 6-Core Processor  ($1044.98 @ NCIX US) 

Motherboard: Asus Rampage IV Extreme EATX  LGA2011 Motherboard  ($429.99 @ NCIX US) 

Memory: G.Skill Ripjaws Z Series 16GB (4 x 4GB) DDR3-2400 Memory  ($449.99 @ Newegg) 

Hard Drive: OCZ Agility 3 240GB 2.5"" Solid State Disk  ($249.99 @ NCIX US) 

Power Supply: Enermax 1350W ATX12V / EPS12V Power Supply  ($283.36 @ NCIX US) 


Could BaPC assist me in choosing parts for this venture? The above parts are a guideline. I am not sure what RAM is really required other than the fact that I need at least 16GB of it (Premiere and Media Encoder can eat up 12 without a problem). 

Thank you for your time.

Anyways, should I just get a 4GB 670 or should I stick with the 2GB 680. What does the difference in memory mean. My understanding of memory is that more memory provides better performance on multiple monitors. Can anyone confirm that or expand on that? Thanks!

Also, I am going to use this card mostly for gaming but I will be doing rendering as well. Mostly video rendering. I am also going to have 2 23"" monitors but I will only game on one and have something like Reddit or YouTube open on the other.

There were a number of people who expressed concern about whether or not TSA would let a full-fledged desktop computer and all the fixins through security.

After successfully going through a few airports I can confirm that yes, if the computer fits within the size constraints (as many mini-itx builds do) you can carry it on no problem. 

Thought I might let everyone know as I've seen a few posts about travelling cross-country with a computer and how to go about it. I say: if it is small enough, carry it on the plane! That way you can baby it and make absolutely sure it doesn't get dropped or jostled too much in transit.

Edit- I lot of people have posted talking about how they carried on mid-towers or larger. All of my travel the past few months has been on small, regional jets. Nothing like a 747 or even 767 size. I was told today (and this was strictly enforced!) that if your carry on item doesn't fit in an overhead compartment or below the seat it MUST be put below the plane. I know my 400R at home wouldn't fit in either of those places unless it went through a wood-chipper first, so just a word for the wise and a reminder with all these stories that *your mileage may vary*!

Also, at least with the 5 airports I have been through with my machine, any/all ""large"" electronic devices have to be taken out of their bag and put into a tray with nothing else in it. This includes PCs, tablets, and laptops; but with my experience does not include things like keyboard, mouse, phone, etc (I usually put all those in a tub together and no one cares but again, ymmv).

Hey, BAPC!

I'll be at CES 2013 for media-related endeavors and will have the fantastic chance to talk to several of our favorite (and maybe not-so-favorite) hardware vendors at the upcoming Consumer Electronics Show 2013; I start working on Jan 7 and will conclude interviews on Jan 11, though the show officially starts Jan 8. Some companies I'll be speaking with will include:

- Intel
- AMD
- nVidia
- NZXT
- ASUS
- SilverStone
- Zalman
- Turtle Beach
- Plantronics
- Logitech
- Acer
- BenQ
- Razer
- Thermaltake
- Rosewill
- Kingston
- LSI / SandForce
- OCZ
- Corsair
- Samsung
- Cooler Master
- Lian-Li
- Many, many more. So many more that I'll be surprised if I don't die from awesome overload.


So... any questions for these folks? I'll be writing numerous articles throughout the show, but can certainly come back with a self-post or update this post with answers.

**/r/buildapc:** Your response has been overwhelming. Working with one of my staff writers, we've managed to read through everything thus far and have augmented our existing list of questions with some of your excellent suggestions. We will continue to read as things are posted. To those wondering how / when I plan to report back: Due to the relative chaos surrounding cons/trade shows of this size, and the added chaos of having to return to a hotel and write articles each night, I'll likely post a self.post once I feel I have adequately obtained quality information for your viewing. My plan is to address as many of the most interesting questions in that self.post; anything left unanswered in the self.post might have still been answered in articles or interviews, so always feel free to ask me for an update on your question. 

I will likely either post back at the very end of CES or near the end, something like Wednesday or Thursday. I may submit a link to an interview with Intel, AMD, or nVidia (all will be conducted on Tuesday, so articles will go live the same day/night) given the sheer number of questions pertaining to their products.",,False,,t5_2rnve,1358101318.0,,,True,t3_15yfeo,http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/15yfeo/rbuildapc_ill_be_talking_to_all_the_major/,

Howdy! I'm new to Reddit -- I wanted to share the rig I built last summer to replace my QX6850 machine.  I use it for everyday use, gaming, and light photo / video editing.  Hope y'all like it as much as I do ;D

**I KNOW the PSU is massive overkill.** I got it for aesthetics (fit the color scheme), and the pre-sleeved 100% modular cables.

**Aesthetic mods:**

Red glow Backplate: I got the 670 before they made a backplate for it, so I ordered a 680 backplate and removed the “680.”  I got some red LEDs and sanded them as flat as possible, then wired them together with the appropriate resistors to connect them to the PSU.  The whole setup was sandwiched between the card and the backplate, with a small piece of very thin polystyrene to diffuse the light across the logo. 

All drives are mounted in the 5.25” bays.  I used Scythe “anti vibration” kits from Xoxide (scuffed and painted black) to go 3.5” to 5.25”.  I used a Silverstone 3.5 to 2x2.5 bay converter from Amazon (scuffed and painted black) for the SSDs.  The optical drive housing was also scuffed and painted black.   I modified the SATA power cable spacing to fit the drive placement in one run.

Stealth door on the optical drive using one of the 650D’s aluminum panels.  Soldered in a momentary switch to activate the disk drawer, and installed the switch in the 650D’s enclosed front panel.
The stock front 650D fan and the Noctua rear case fan were painted black w/ red blades.

Lighting: Two red LED Sunlight Sticks from Xoxide wired to a PCI slot rocker panel switch on the back of the rig.  I wrapped the LED sticks with a faux etched-glass vinyl film that give them a softer, more diffused glow.

The Corsair, PSU, EVGA, and NVIDIA logos are print/cut or cut vinyl that I designed in illustrator and had produced by a friend at a sign shop.

Thanks Asus.

I only encountered one problem: the Seasonic X-Series 650W had a bad whining noise when the PC was turned off (coil whine), so I returned it, and got a Cooler Master Silent Pro Gold 800W instead. It works like a charm, and has the added benefit of making it even easier to upgrade to SLI and watercooling later on ;-)

You guys recommended me another case, but I like a clean and simple look - something I think the Lian-Li is good at. What it is not so good at, is leaving me room to do cable management on the backside - geez it was a tight fit. I think I spend at lest 4 hours zip-tie'ing everything close to the case...

Anyway, thanks for your help /r/buildapc!

Edit: I know I could have saved some money here and there, but overall I am very happy with the build. I live in Denmark so the prices are not what I have payed, nor are any combos available.

Furthermore, I only build the case + interior now. The peripherals are from two months to several years old.

I tried, but I'm not a photographer.  First time posting on /r/buildapc however I do lurk a lot over here to see what people are doing (like using a lot of stock heat sinks and fans that come with your CPUs... why?)

Anyhow here's the story:

Started to upgrade my previous build... one thing led to another thing and I was buying computer parts and waterblocks like nobody's business.

It's mainly used for gaming. Runs beyond quiet even under load. Stays extremely cool. Intel has won me over. First PC I ever built had an Intel processor and I've finally come back around after 6 AMD builds. Definitely money well spent.

GPU OCed through maxed-out CCC. Doesn't break a sweat at 1125/1575. Hasn't gone above 54C while playing Crysis 3 with everything maxed out (just to force the system to work for it).

CPU will be overclocked shortly, currently running stock under load @ 44C on core 0 and 48C on cores 1, 2 and 3.

Mountain Mods makes great cases, however this one will test your patience. Literal blood, sweat and tears went into this case.

Coolant is distilled water w/ some dish soap and dead water drops.  When it comes time to do maintenance in ~6 months I'll probably replace the fittings with Bitspower ones (not that the XSPC ones are bad... although 1 of them did break).


Edit:
The temps are with the fan controllers turned down all the way on each fan.  Ambient is around 30C.

Why is the PS4 packing 8GB of GDDR5 anyway, have I got this part out of context? because a 4GB GPU is considered a waste anyway unless you're running 3 monitors, say 5760x1080.

And I read that GDDR memory isn't that great to be used as system memory as it's obviously created and optimised for use on a graphics card, but are they going to have it as shared memory or something?

Hello everyone at Build A PC I made my first custom pc and I would like your opinion on it. 
I do not play video games on the highest resolution and all settings. Also I am using a TV that only has 720p resolution and thus my computer runs as 1366 x 768. Games I play Borderlands 2, Saints Row 3, GTA 4, CS: GO to just name a few.

I already owned a oc-z SSD (SATA 2) 32GB , 500GB Mechanical hard drive ,and optical drive which is why it is not posted.

EDIT: Stay Tuned Tomorrow and This coming weekend for more benchmarks. I have to go back to school in San Jose State and I only have access to this computer on the weekends. Thanks for the support and opinions on this build. I really wanted to build a custom pc when I was a sophomore in high school but did not have the time or money yet. Waited until College to build it and I gotta say it is the right timing. 
Thanks again everyone at Build a PC!

But according to my research I'm not the only one, so something to be conscious of.

Don't know if this has been said before, but it caused me a little headache and I wanted to share. It deals with graphics performance (single screen gaming on dual monitor set ups) 

I have an i5 3570k/ Sapphire 7950 oc(factory oc model) build running 2x1080p asus 23"" LED monitors (one on dvi the other HDMI. Both from the 7950). I only game on one and use the other for convenience of task management. I noticed after adding the second monitor that my frame rate wasn't doing so great in heavy load games. I played around with the OC function in CCC to try and boost performance. I turned it up to around 1050mhz core clock and 1500mhz memory clock, but noticed no increase in framerate. I installed all_cpu and all_gpu as gadgets on my second monitor to see my temps and %usage while gaming. Turns out my 7950 was never going above 500mhz core clock. 

After some research I found that AMD cards (not sure about nvidia) will occasionally not deal well with running a game on one screen and desktop on the other. I'm not the first to have the problem it seems. 

A work around I found was to run my secondary monitor off of integrated graphics and the primary gaming monitor off of the 7950. This fixed everything perfectly. 

Sorry I know that was long, and may be common knowledge, but just a heads up to anyone with a similar set up to mine, you may be getting some performance lag.

I run a small computer visualization business and this is the first real piece of equipment I've set up for the job. I have been crunching renderings on my MacBook Pro, and after waiting about 2 days for a rendering to finish I decided to pull the trigger on this project. I primarily use Blender (rendering in Cycles), 3ds Max (rendering in V-Ray), and the Adobe Suite.

The dual GTX 580 3gb are for the Blender Cycles engine. The 500-level GPUs were optimized CUDA cards (besides the titan), and since gaming is secondary I really didn't have a better choice. For anyone interested in the benchmarks, [check here](http://blenderartists.org/forum/showthread.php?239480-2-61-Cycles-render-benchmark). I have such a massive PSU because I plan on slowly phasing in Titans to this build (I'm planning on 3), and I read great reviews of the X-1250. When the time comes, I will also get a full tower case - the R4 is awesome but it's really tight inside with the 580s and the h100i.

Since my last post I've figured out all of the temps. Out of the box, my 3930k was idling around 35°: http://i.imgur.com/2sw9kQt.jpg and my 580's were idling around 45°: http://i.imgur.com/WxTQIf5.jpg. This is with an ambient temp of 85°F and humid. After tweaking my fan curve on the 580's they're now idling at 39° and they don't go above 65° with 20 minutes of 100% load. I haven't seen the CPU go above 55° while running all of the benchmarks. This is good since I plan to start overclocking tonight. 

I already own the Razer mouse and the ViewSonic 22"" monitor. It's painful to not own a 1600p monitor with this set up, but I simply can't afford it after this build.

The build is NOT silent. The stock fans on the h100i absolutely blow...haha...but they sound like a small jet taking off. Also my slim Prolimatech on the side of the case is quite noisy. I'm going to replace all of these with various Noctua fans since the ones I have are wonderful. I just need to save some more money first.

I'm also going to buy an extension for my CPU power cable (you'll notice it's running in front of the components). Does this sub have any recommendations?

That's it! Cheers.",,False,,t5_2rnve,False,,,True,t3_1hr4l5,http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/1hr4l5/build_complete_not_sure_why_my_last_post_was/,
1360286398.0,232,self.buildapc,183p2x,I asked Overclockers.com's Matt Bidinger what he thought about the Tek Syndicate  8350 vs 3570K videos. He had some interesting stuff to say. ,342,110,127,http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/183p2x/i_asked_overclockerscoms_matt_bidinger_what_he/,"&gt;First and most importantly, you cannot directly compare these results to other benchmark results. The results in the video are for gaming WHILE RUNNING x264 encoding by using Xsplit to stream the game. So their testing is only relevant to gaming while x264 encoding a stream with Xsplit... If you don't game while running Xsplit, those results are meaningless.
&gt;
&gt;Now who is tek syndicate? Minus points here. By doing a WHOIS on the domain, I see their domain was created in August 2011. They have existed for a little over a year, so I don't know any history on their credibility or what the background is for the people producing the content. For reviews, look somewhere with a history and blood in the game. It doesn't inspire confidence when the guy at Tek Syndicate ends the video with ""too many numbers fuck. Numberrrrrs. Ahhhhhhh"". Ya, when doing reviews, you have to properly work with numbers - it isn't rocket science! And ""fuck"" is simply unprofessional. In the bar, with friends, or even on Reddit, fine... When doing your job, not the time or place.
&gt;
&gt;Next, their work is sloppy in their finished product. Sometimes in the first video he's saying one FPS, and the FPS presented on the screen is different. In their [written results](http://teksyndicate.com/videos/amd-fx-8350-vs-intel-3570k-vs-3770k-vs-3820-gaming-and-xsplit-streaming-benchmarks), they flip flop between presenting 1080 results first and 1440 results first - why? Because they can't keep their numbers straight. If they can't present things consistently in the final product they put all this work into, they probably made other mistakes before it was finished - it is anyone's guess what those mistakes were.
&gt;
&gt;Why did they test with a top end AMD board against a mini-ITX Intel board? The Stinger is a fine board but this testing platform decision is illogical.
&gt;
&gt;What they tested with (One high end board, a mini-ITX board, and a medium graphics card):
&gt;FX-8350 w/ MSI 990FXA-GD80, 7870 GPU
&gt;3570k/3770k w/ EVGA Z77 Stinger mini-ITX Motherboard, 7870 GPU
&gt;
&gt;[What we tested with (all top of the line)](http://www.overclockers.com/amd-fx-8350-piledriver-gaming-comparison):
&gt;8350 w/ Crosshair V Formula, Asus 7970 DCU II TOP GPU
&gt;3770K w/ Maximus V Extreme, Asus 7970 DCU II TOP GPU
&gt;
&gt;All our tests were done at 1080P, settings maxed. Straightforward and simple - it did not include their higher resolution testing. It did not include testing with Xsplit. So let's ignore 1440 because we don't have comparison numbers.
&gt;
&gt;Take Metro 2033 for example. This is the best example that their test was erroneous for gaming performance (their test is only relevant for gaming while running Xsplit). After the results, they talk about how the 8350 kills in Metro 2033... WTF? If they were well informed they would be aware that at higher resolutions Metro 2033 is VERY GPU bound. Metro 2033 is a GPU bound bench, which means CPU power matters very little because the GPU is the bottleneck. But for whatever reason, when running Metro 2033 and Xsplit at the same time, their results on Intel were terrible (possibly because the FX-8350 has more cores to dedicate to encoding under Xsplit).
&gt;
&gt;So the Metro 2033 results at 1080P?
&gt;FX8350: Them - 36.44, Us - 36
&gt;3770K: Them - 27.48, Us - 37.3
&gt;3570K: Them - 21.2
&gt;3820: Them - 21.32
&gt;
&gt;So on Metro 2033 at 1080P, they get WILDLY different results on the FX-8350 vs 3770K vs 3570K vs 3820. Something is wrong here. I don't know, but for instance, the 3820 is more similar to the 3770K in core/thread count, yet the 3820 results are more similar to the 3570K results... The 3820 and 3770K should perform similaly due to 4 cores/8 threads, while the 3570K only has 4 cores/4 threads. Their results just aren't logical. The test environment could have been bad.

&gt;I looked around, and similar criticisms to mine of these videos are on anandtech forums:

Hey folks, I started this build almost a month ago, and I completed it about 2 weeks ago now, still have some optimizing with the SSD and a bit better cable management to do, but all in all it went very smooth, and yielded better than expected results.

Putting this computer together was a real PITA and cable management is pretty much non-existent, but I'm pretty pleased with the end result. The SG05 was designed for a SFX PSUs so I had to leave the PSU outside the case. Temps with Furmark &amp; Prime95 running are ~67C, temps are around ~61C during gaming.

I have been reading you and sometimes contributing for quite a while. 

I was extremely frustrated about a month or two ago when everytime (I do mean every single time) anybody posted a build showing 8GB of ram, the top comment would always be something along the lines of:

""You'll never need 8gb, that's just overkill. Get 4gb, etc etc""
And this is on a thousand dollar machine. The difference then was something like 20-30 dollars to go for 8gb, and while the person was buying a 200-300 dollar video card you guys would suggest to save on what is usually the biggest bottleneck in an old computer.

Now, 2 months later every build has 8gb of ram and nobody is saying anything. I got into huge arguments about this 2 months ago and I will say it again.

If it's not too much, always get more.

/rant

EDIT: Lots of answers about how ram is cheaper now and this and that. I get it. Like I said at that point in time it was something like 20-30 dollars more to get 8gb instead of 4gb. The problem is I saw lots of guys buying mobos with 2 ram slots and getting advice like: Just get 2x2gb instead of 2x4gb.

Now to make financial sense they have to wait until 2x4gb is less than the 20-30 dollars. Do you see what I'm getting at? If you're going to spend 1000 dollars (hell even 600 dollars) on a machine, you should be able to spare an extra 30 bucks for something that (and I repeat myself here) will not hurt you to have too much, and that computers often have too little of.",,False,,t5_2rnve,True,,,True,t3_kgqd8,http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/kgqd8/but_i_thought_4gb_was_all_i_ever_needed/,

(or just put the word out that you want a dead or dying drive) Ask the seller to send you a picture of the top of the drive. When they send you the pic go to the drive manufacturers website and enter the serial number in the warranty checker tool they they provide. If the drive comes back listed as still under warranty then buy the drive. Most drives have 5 year warranties so your chances are good. Mine was from a friend's computer that died a few months ago. He had since bought a new one. He gave me his old one. This is how I got a re-manufactured/refurbed Seagate 500gb 7200 for 10 bucks. (cost of shipping)    

It will take a couple weeks for you to mail the dead drive to the manufacturers repair center and for them to get it back to you, but they generally just keep your drive and send you one they already repaired.  Either way you get a ""good as new"" drive for dirt cheap.

EDIT:  Most people would just give you an old broken hard drive, you can also find them at computer recycling centers for instance in portland we have ""[free Geek](http://www.freegeek.org/)"" that i doubt we be too bothered to give or sell you a failed drive.  Im not sure if they even bother RMAing them.  check your area for something similar.

Also keep in mind that the refurbed drive you receive is usually warranted for as long as you had left on the original drive, so you aren't SOL if it dies too.

  

*EDIT2:  When you are looking its worth noting that you may want to avoid wasting your time on OEM drives provided by dell, compaq etc.  as the warranties are normally provided through the PC manufacturer and not the drive manufacturer.

Personally, it is Razor products for me. Not that its a shitty product or ridiculously overpriced, i just find their stuff soooo cheesy. (most notably their keyboards) It's like all this gamer branded crap that people invest in, when there are better, cheaper, more personable stuff available, and all you have to do is a little research.

* A streamlined sidebar with clear posting rules
* New ""build statistics"" box at the bottom of the subreddit index featuring statistics courtesy of [buildsbot.com](http://buildsbot.com) (Note that the Harddrive statistics are currently not working)
* An [updated submission page](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/submit) which hopefully clearly outlines what not to post, as well as how to tag submissions

Please let me know any issues you encounter, or any improvements you think could be made.  If you find a bug, please take a screenshot and either post it in this thread, or [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fbuildapc).  I hope you guys find these updates to be beneficial!

For the curious, here is the full change log:

* Added ""filter"" box at the top of the sidebar
* Added ""recent builds/buildsbot.com"" box at the top of the sidebar
* Move subreddit description up higher, for better visibility
* Rewrote the description and ""new here?"" sections
* Added the posting rules/create a submission box

**Is it worth the trip for me? I'd rather not waste the rest of my day after work. Below are more details -- but if you don't want to read, any advice on whether I should spend my entire evening going to Micro Center would be greatly appreciated.**

* I'm not sure how much I'm going to spend on my rig yet. Originally I was going to go with an i5 3470 build (because I have no interest in OCing) for around $800-$900. 

* But today I started to think I'd be better off spending $500-$700 on a AMD FX 6300 build, because I'm not sure I do enough on my computer to justify needing the i5 and spending $800-$900. 

* I'd like to play more computer games, but I just don't. I've really only played a little SC-II in the past year, nothing else. I'd like to think I'd start playing more if I had a better computer than my 4-year old laptop, but I don't honestly know if I would take full advantage of a more expensive build.

* All that being said, I saw the deal on newegg.com today for the i5 3570K bundled with the Asus Z77 extreme4 mobo, for only $295. That deal almost makes getting the i5 3470 seem pointless (especially if I bought it online). At microcenter I could get the 3470 for $150 plus tax so like $162 + 120-130 for the same mobo, and it's almost the same price as the 3570K bundle.

I really am unsure what I should do. I don't mind spending more on a computer, and even possibly learning to OC with the 3570K. But as a causal PC gamer at best, does it really make sense to? Any advice on whether or not to make the trip, and which build I should go for would be a lot of help. And thanks guys for helping to create such a great subreddit. 

Edit: Hey everyone, thanks for all the responses, I did actually go out to Micro Center and ended up getting everything I needed there, so I wasn't able to respond to all you comments. I could have probably saved $30-$50 if I was patient, but once I got to Micro Center I decided I wanted my new PC tonight. It was a long trek home and I'm tired, so I'll post my build here tomorrow.

1373768463.0,224,self.buildapc,1i9452,How to use used parts in your build to save money and get a more powerful PC,274,50,57,http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/1i9452/how_to_use_used_parts_in_your_build_to_save_money/,"So, over the years, I've slowly started getting more and more of my PC components used on ebay, and through all of it, I've learned quite a few lessons that might be helpful for others going the same route. 

1. You're not likely to be able to find the absolute latest and greatest. I've found good deals start popping up around a year after a part is released, and you'll often find stuff start appearing used for 25% or more off of what you'll find the same parts new.
2. Check the sellers feedback rating. If they have very few feedback ratings, or have a significant amount that are negative, even if they are offering a good deal, its usually a good idea to walk away and find another deal.
3. Don't get attached. Often you'll get involved in a bidding war and then realize you've spent a lot more than you originally intended to on a part. You have to be patient, if you have a budget, keep looking and eventually you'll probably find what you want within your budget, just because it isn't listed now doesn't mean you should just go and pay a higher price. 
2. It really helps to already have some sort of PC you can test the parts you get in. Since you won't be getting all your parts at once, and you won't be getting them from a large retailer like amazon or newegg, there's a much bigger chance that your parts wont work. This isn't the end of the world, but since the return periods are usually quite short, you want to be able to test that the parts you get work as soon as possible after you buy them. Even if you have to borrow a friend's PC to test some parts, it can be quite worth it. 
3. Some parts are better than others to get used. I've made a list below of the various parts and my opinions on getting them used. 

Motherboards: These are the best things to get used, from what I've found. Sockets often last a few years, and if you are getting it on the tail end of a socket, you can pick up incredible deals. For example, I bought a nice Z68 motherboard for only $55. It was easily three times that new, and it works with ivy bridge processors, and could have easily shaved $100 off of a build. As with my earlier advice, you'll want to wait about a year after a socket comes out before you start seeing good used deals on motherboards. Also, the second you take it out of the box it comes in, CHECK THE PINS. They are the most likely thing to be broken, and you don't want to get burned.

CPUs: I've not had as much luck with these, for some reason they hold their value better. You'll certainly save some money buying used, but even 3 year old chips still are often at 75-80% of their original retail price. They also often won't come with the original heatsink, so if you were expecting that, you may need to get a heatsink of your own.

RAM: Once again you're not likely to find very good deals here, but RAM is relatively cheap already and has a higher failure rate then some parts, so unless you are really strapped for cash, I'd buy these new. 

HDD: While you can sometimes find pretty good savings, especially on lower capacities like 500GB, you have to be weary, since HDDs are already the most unreliable part of a normal PC to begin with. Once again, I'd advise buying the HDD new unless you come across a very good deal.

PSU: There are good oppurtunities here, but you have to BE CAREFUL. Don't be lulled into the fact that you'll quickly see 1000W PSUs on ebay for $50. If it isn't a reputable brand, don't get it. If it doesn't have any brand name listed at all, run far, far, away, because it is probably utter crap. Since the PSUs you'll find are used, you'll often find that they have a slightly lower efficiency rating than modern PSUs, but for most people that isn't a significant difference. You'll also want to make sure that if you're buying a modular power supply, the seller includes all the original cables. 

Cases: Can be good deals, but shipping is a bitch. There's no real good way to get around high shipping costs, so if you see a deal that looks too good to be true, check the shipping first. Beyond that, there's not too much that can be wrong with a case, so if you see something that's a good deal and doesn't have over the top shipping, it might be worth it. 

Video Cards: There are really good possibilities here. I just recently got a 7970 for $250 total. Another good thing to look for is high end but last generation video cards. For example, if you are careful you can find a working GTX 480 for $100, and while it runs hot as hell and uses a lot of power, it will have significantly more power than any video card you can buy new for $100. 

Speakers: These aren't exactly a computer part, but because of the fact that speaker tech doesn't change anywhere near as quickly, you can often pick up 5 or 10 year old speakers that sound as good as, if not better, than modern computer speakers, but for half the price. Just make sure they include all the original parts, I've sometimes found ones that don't include the sub, but only mention that deep in the description. 



I'll probably edit this at a later time as I think of new things and other things I can add, but I think this is a good starting point for anyone who wants to either build a new PC or upgrade their PC using used parts.

Short Review Section
Gigabyte Z77X-UD3H - Great all around board. looks great. I love the matte black pcb. Because the debug code is really the only thing lighting up in my case right now, It gives my case a nice red tint.

Crucial M4 - I new how fast it was going to be but I couldn't really grasp how much difference it makes until I actually got one. This thing is amazing. Quick question.

Gigabyte GTX 670 - Scoffs at whatever games I throw at it. I was really pissed last night because I didn't have any games that could really utilize the full ability of this card. I think it is actually harder for this card to display the desktop than it is to play minecraft. If you look at some of my original posts, I was going to get the MSI TF4 version. But beggars can't be choosers, and the Gigabyte cooler is just as good if not better than the MSI one.

Corsair C70 - Love the militaristic styling of the case. Hate the fanholes cut in the window. The handles on top also make this case all the better. They make it so easy to move.

A quick question before I give in to your demands.
 - The HDD SSD combo. How do I format the HDD correctly so I can put some games on the HDD and some on the SSD? Everytime I try to install something on the HDD ""it says invalid location"". I was wondering if there was a way to get around that, or just a way to properly format the drive.

tldr; sweet computer, overkill, reviews on some of the components, please read the question above, and answer if you can.

HDD is a 2.5"" 7200rpm Notebook HDD (Forget what brand).  

The original NES reset switch was moved over and connected to power. NES reset is momentary, while the Power is on/off.

I used a decent amount of epoxy and hot glue.

USB ports via hot glue (damn hard to mount with only a dremel and glue gun).  
Good bit of solder for the custom power switch, and power light.

I will be adding more pictures, particularly of the messy insides and how I rigged the power switch to the MoBo.  
Also, after having the NES on for 2-3hours, it overheated and froze. Luckily by default it beeps at me when this happens so nothing was damaged. If you're ""inspired"" to do the same build, throw in any size fan you can fit. Probably only a 40-50mm if you're mounting it to the top vents (aprx 4.5cm width).

Inevitably, we first direct them towards our FAQ, then to the BaPC Beginners Guide, as well as the other resources in the sidebar.  I was hoping we could avoid this unnecessary step by having a popup show up before submitting a link, much like /r/AskScience does.  If you go to submit a link, a red bar appears on mouse over directing everyone to ""Please read our guidlines for complete rules.""

I believe we could avoid some unnecessary posts by having an information bar appear in the same fashion, much like the following:

2. no aftermarket cooler is needed for budget builds.

3. Integrated graphics processor is all that is needed for full 1920x1080 resolution, even 1920x1200. It is for typical display tasks only, not gaming - ""Perfect for a machine for  watching cat videos""). Playing flash/java games would be easy too.

4. 4gbs of ram will be sufficient for anyone, even if slightly gaming or opening up tabs in different browsers.

5. 64gb SSDs are about 75 bucks now so if you don't need the space get that, if space is needed then I would recommend a 250-320gb 7200rpm HDD for about the same price as the SSD or less.

6. A 250-300W psu will be more than enough to power on a machine with no discrete graphics card, there's some nicely priced 400-600W PSUs out on the market so if the difference is not much pick one up as long as the reviews and ratings are good. ALWAYS ask buildapc or check competent reviews (JonnyGURU, HardOCP, Anandtech, etc.)

7. For keyboard and mouse there's always the cheap wired route, people would be surprised as to how a 20 dollar set of wired Logitech peripherals work.

8. If a monitor is needed I've seen 19"" LCDs for way less than 100.

9. There's always cheap cases and then there's nice cases that are low priced, NZXTs offerings under 50USD are really good and they look amazingly well too.

10. Windows 7 Home Premium is more than enough for any task. (in my opinion)

11. If wanting to build a good budget gaming build then an 2nd gen i3 CPU is more than enough, often performing better than AMDs FX line of CPUs. Adding a 6870 to something like this and you'll have a complete gaming machine for about 700 including peripherals, OS, etc.

1.  If you are building a pc, post your budget.  We can't help without a budget (even if money isn't an issue)

2.  If you want help with a build, tech support, anything relating to your pc, post your build using [pcpartpicker](http://pcpartpicker.com/) or a screenshot of your shopping cart (newegg for example).  Please **paste** the reddit markup if you use pcpartpicker.  Most of us will ignore your post if it is just a bunch of links.

3.  POST YOUR BUILD!  So important it needs to be said twice.  Even if you think everything is wrong or you don't know anything we are 10000x more likely to help if you at least put in a little effort

4.  Post WHAT your build is for.  How can we recommend a cpu if we don't know whether or not you are gaming, web browsing, or rendering 3D models?

5.  We aren't here to build this for you.  BaPC is an awesome community and we will help you make your dream computer a reality; we just want to see a little effort on your end first.

6.  Read the sidebar.  Read the sidebar.  Read the sidebar.  There is so much useful info over there that I get a bit ticked off when people ask questions that could easily be answered if they took 30 seconds to look at the sidebar.

7.  Before you ask a question, try doing a quick search of the sub.  We see questions like ""Intel or AMD?"" at least once a day...

1354456536.0,213,self.buildapc,145f67,A Guide For Painting The Case,261,48,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/145f67/a_guide_for_painting_the_case/,"So about a week ago I asked if people here would like a guide on how to paint a pc case. Needless to say everyone was excited including me as I was going to show you my own written guide. Unfortunately I had camera problems and lost the important first steps to painting a case. 

HOWEVER, I'm still able to provide you the much anticipated guide and answer questions! 

I found a very simple easy to follow youtube guide on how to paint your pc case. The guy covers it all from start to finish and even shows some extra tricks you can do if needed to make it look really nice. 

http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4H_vT_EBhZhl8dG8OlxHDU5uBGNhjgyd

Some questions to answer you might ask from the video:

- *Is adhesion promoter a primer paint? -*  No. Think of it more like glue for your primer so it REALLY sticks to the surface. 

- *Do I really need to sand my case before painting it? My case is (brand new/fairly new/pretty clean since it mainly sits on my desk) and at the most just needs to get some dust off of it.* Yes you do! And don't forget to wipe it clean before you prime it. You need to make the surface of your case something the paint will stick to. sanding it will give it that something. 

* *How long do I wait before applying another coat?* Every paint/primer/chemical you apply onto something requires different times. With the paint you give it extra time. If you are putting another color on top of another color wait even longer than the maximum waiting time for applying another coat or finish. 

* *Can't I use paint for plastic on the plastic parts and the other paints for the metal stuff?* You can, but there will be some noticeable difference. I suggest using the paints for plastics on the fans, or other parts you want intentionally to stand out.

* *I hate the glossy look. How do I get that matte finish?* Look for paints labeled flat on the colors. You can also just use really high grit sanding to achieve a matte finish (3000+). Just understand the gloss helps somewhat on the scratch protection factor. 

* *Do I need to use glossy finish if my spray paint is labeled glossy already?* Yes. you need to sand between coats of each anyway, and it will look MUCH MUCH nicer if you use the glossy finish. 

* *Anything else you think is important that I should know?* Two things: First practice different paint designs on tin sheet plating from your hardware store. And second **THE FIRST BASE COAT MUST BE FLAT!**

I plan to still post the finished work of my case. until then I hope this guide helps and will answer any other questions. ",,False,,t5_2rnve,False,,,True,t3_145f67,http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/145f67/a_guide_for_painting_the_case/,

It allows you to turn your computer into two separate workstations as long as you have a second monitor, mouse, and keyboard.  It's 50 bucks but there is also a trial version so you can see how amazing this is.

If you run an office they have a more expensive version that can turn one workstation into 8 as long as you have certain connectors.

I haven't tested trying multiple accounts with Steam as I only have one log in, so I am eager to hear if that works.   Imagine the LAN parties where all your friends don't need to bring their tower over.

1362429020.0,212,self.buildapc,19npmi,[Guide] Cooling your System,254,42,77,http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/19npmi/guide_cooling_your_system/,"This guide is all about cooling your system. I will try to cover temperatures, case cooling, case fans, and cooling your CPU/GPU.

**Temperatures**

I see a lot of post on /r/buildapc which ask ""Are these temperatures good?"". I will share you my secret when I ever have any questions. [Click Here](http://www.google.com/). Literally you can ask it almost anything and it will give you an answer...

Enough of that rant, every component has different temperature limits. Some can take more heat than others. Even same component types, CPU for example will have different limits. 

*Recommended Max Temperatures* These temperatures are not the real manufacturer maximum temperatures. These are *RECOMMENDED MAXIMUM TEMPERATURE*, running the components above these temperatures, for a long period of time, may diminish the life expectancy of the component.

* AMD CPU: Around 60°C
* Intel CPU: Around 75°C
* GPU (AMD/Nvidia): Around 80°C
* HDD/SSD: Around 30°C 

*Thermal throttle* Most new generation CPU has automatic thermal throttle. The MOBO decreases the CPU speed, reducing the amount of heat the CPU is outputting. This is used when the CPU is reaching its maximum temperature.

Programs to use to monitor temperatures:

* Intel/AMD: (CPU &amp;amp; GPU) [HWMonitor](http://www.cpuid.com/softwares/hwmonitor.html) Recommended. Shows other helpful information.
* Intel/AMD: (CPU) [Core Temp](http://www.alcpu.com/CoreTemp/)
* AMD: (CPU &amp;amp; GPU) [AMD Overdrive](http://sites.amd.com/us/game/downloads/amd-overdrive/pages/overview.aspx)
* Intel: (CPU) [Real Temp](http://www.techpowerup.com/realtemp/) Very nice program for Intel. Shows information until Max Temp. is reached.

Most GPU's sold today include software which allows for a diagnostic of their GPU. These software can be used of OC and look information about their GPU's, temperature, core clock, memory clock, fan speed, and even sometimes fan control . 

* [MSI Afterburner](http://event.msi.com/vga/afterburner/download.htm)
* [ASUS GPU Tweak](http://support.asus.com/download.aspx?SLanguage=en&amp;amp;m=gpu%20tweak&amp;amp;os=30)
* [Sapphire Trixx](https://www.sapphireselectclub.com/ssc/TriXX/)

Now if you want to see what the air is like in your case, you will need a temperature probe and something to read that sensor. Most people use [fan controllers](http://www.frozencpu.com/products/16086/bus-312/Bitfenix_Recon_Five_Channel_Fan_Controller_w_Internet_Connected_Control_BFA-RCN-KS-RP.html). Fan controllers allow to control the speed of the fan, and sometimes allows for the display of fan speed and temperatures from the probes. Some MOBO's now implement a temperature probe input, which temperatures from the probe can be viewed from the BIOS screen.

*What can affect the temperatures*

* Case: Some cases are just terrible for airflow. 
* Cable Management: You basically don't want things getting in the way of airflow. The air should be able to move through the case without being interrupted.
* Fans: The more fans the better cooling, but there is a limit where the more fans you have the less affect it will have. 
* Components: Basically the more components you have the hotter it will get.
* OC: OC your components will make them work harder, in turn producing more heat.
* How you are cooling your components: Basically your components will run cooler with higher end cooling.
* Ambient Temp: This is the temperature of the air. Components would never go below this temperature. If it is hot in your room, then you are blowing hot air into your case. 

**Case Cooling**

*Cable Management*

Picking a case with good cable management, allowing for wires to be hidden, will definitely improve the cases cooling capacity. As stated before, having good airflow will allow for the components to be cooled and heat to be properly exhausted.

*Case Fan Mounts* 

* Back Mount: Exhaust. Since this is the closest fan to the CPU, it will be most beneficial for exhausting, quickly removing the heat produced by the CPU.
* Front Mount: Intake. Having the front as an intake and the back as an exhaust, you are creating an airflow through your components. Cool air moves from the front to the back.
* Side Mounts: Intake. IMO any fans mounted on the side should be an intake. It allows for cool air to quickly reach the components.
* Top Mount: Intake/Exhaust. Some people think exhaust, since heat rises. Other say intake, since it is forcing more cool air into the system. Since every system is different, choose which ever gives you the best results. 

*Liquid Cooling*

This is another whole section by itself. Here is a link to /r/buildapc 100K contest winner, /u/Alfaa123 **[Another Custom Loop Guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/18uxax/guide_another_custom_loop_guide_enjoy_buildapc/)**. It has a great overview on what you will need to know.

**Case Fans**

One of the biggest factors in cooling your system is the fans you decide to buy. There are tons of options. There are a couple of things you should be looking at.

* Size (mm): Size of the fan, needs to correspond with the size of the fan mount holes.
* Speed (RPM): How fast the fans spin.
* Air Flow (CFM):  How much air the fan will push. 
* Static Pressure (mm/H2O): How much force the air pushed will have. More relevant in WC.
* Noise Level (dba):How much noise the fan makes at certain speeds.
* Bearing Type: How the fan was constructed to spin. 
* Power Connector: How the fan receives its power.

Picking a case fan can range from easy to down right OCD. For regular use, picking a good reviewed fan will suffice. There are those who want more out of their fans. 

*Air Flow vs Noise* With higher air flow, you are looking at higher noise level. Some people really don't mind the noise level, but there are others that cannot tolerate it. Not all fans with high airflow will result in high noise level. Higher quality fans will balance both, but may come with a higher price tag.

*Static Pressure* Some manufacturers will list the Static Pressure of a fan. Static Pressure is the amount of pressure the air is pushed. High static pressure fans are used for WC radiators. High static pressure allows for the air to be pushed through the radiator fins, allowing for optimize cooling. If you are using a fan for pure air cooling, you do not need to worry about static pressure.

*Power Connector* There are 3 basic types, Molex, 3-Pin, 4-Pin PWM. 

* Molex: The most basic kind. You basically take the power straight from the PSU. This will run the fan at its highest rated speed. No control.
* 3-Pin: It can either plug in through the MOBO or a fan controller. It allows for the monitoring of the fan speed, which can be displayed in the BIOS or fan controller. Most of the time it can also be controlled through the MOBO and fan controller.
* 4-Pin PWM: It can either plug in through the MOBO or a fan controller. It also allows for monitoring of the fan speed and adjustment of the speed.

**Cooling your CPU/GPU**

*Stock Cooler*

Its perfectly fine to run a system on stock cooler, permitting that the temperature doesn't put your components in the recommended maximum temperatures. What you might get is a very noisy system.

*Aftermarket Cooler* (Air)

All the cooler works, even the stock cooler, work in the same principle. Metal will absorb the heat from the component, and air is used to dissipate the heat. What makes aftermarket coolers desirable is the amount of heat it can absorb and dissipate, it also tends to be much quieter than the stock cooler for this reason. Most aftermarket coolers are paired with fans. 

There are plenty of reviews on aftermarket coolers for you to choose the best one for your system. Remember [Click Here](http://www.google.com/). Use the link wisely.

*Aftermarket Cooler* (Liquid)

There are two types, maybe three types now. AIO/CLC (All In One/Close Loop Coolers), Custom, and Hybrid (Swiftech H220). AIO liquid cooling refers to pre-assembled kits. All you have to do is mount the radiator, fan, and the heatsink. There is no extra work. I would recommend going through the **[Another Custom Loop Guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/18uxax/guide_another_custom_loop_guide_enjoy_buildapc/)** for you custom water loops. Swiftech has just released the H220, which is an AIO with the ability to expand. Again I would research the system that would work for you.

Hopefully this covers a lot of things about cooling your system. One thing that I did not want to do is make suggestions, as you have read through. There are many wonderful resources and redditors. They will gladly give you their inputs if you have any question on what fan you might want to get, which aftermarket cooler, etc. **I also want to stress that if you have a question, it is most likely somebody have already asked it. Instead of asking ""which fan to get"", simply typing ""best 120mm fan"" into Google will get you results.** I know there might be some key information I might be missing or you might still have question. This guide is not *perfect*. I will continue on updating the guide.

1368535248.0,205,self.buildapc,1eb6y1,[Build Complete] $1500 gaming PC,242,37,137,http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/1eb6y1/build_complete_1500_gaming_pc/,"Just finished my first ever PC build last night. You guys were [a ton of help](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/1dq7eq/build_ready_purchasing_parts_today_1500_gaming/) and I'd like to thank you.

I decided to get back to my roots of PC gaming after hearing the first rumors about the next consoles and seeing the WiiU stumble out of the gate. Always-online DRM? Locking out used copies of games? All of this stuff sounded incredibly restrictive, and I was already getting tired of shelling out $50 per year for an Xbox live subscription and having to deal with a dashboard full of advertisements. I spent a lot of time in the late '90s and early 2000s as a primarily PC gamer, and I find a return to those roots attractive. So I set out to build a beast of a gaming PC last Autumn. I knew from the get-go that this machine would be used almost exclusively for gaming; I have an Android tablet to use for instant messaging, e-mailing, browsing Reddit, etc. After months of research and plenty of help from you guys this is what I ended up with.

From the very beginning I knew I wanted to build a machine in the NZXT Phantom 410, particularly because of the fact that I love the way it looks and it always seemed to have ample bells and whistles as far as cable management was concerned. Another reason for my preference was the fact that I planned on keeping the case on top of the desk, which pretty much ruled out a full-sized case. From the very beginning, the Phantom 410 was a strong preference of mine, and I found the gunmetal to be a less ostentatious choice rather than the others available, yet still unique enough to set it apart from all of the other black on black cases out there.
I knew from the beginning that a big focus of this build would be the GPU. The Sapphire Radeon 7970 seemed a highly suggested choice among those more knowledgeable than I, yet still within the range of what I was willing to spend. So I went with that. Not much to say there. I'm not well-schooled in the technical aspects of what separates one card from another, so I went with what most people seemed to tout as a very high-powered graphics card.

A bit later in the research process I found the idea of overclocking not only to be applicable to my situation with gaming, but also fascinating in essence. Like tuning a car, you can fiddle around with settings until you've reached an optimal balance between stability and performance. I decided that I'd like to try my hand at it, and I was recommended the Gigabyte UD3H motherboard as a solid board to overclock with. This is also where the unlocked CPU and the aftermarket cooler came from.

Very late in the process I decided that I'd rather spend the money to go with an SSD-only build as well. I found the idea of having one larger, more expensive SSD to be very attractive and convenient rather than managing two separate drives. I don't store much media (Facebook for photos, Spotify for music, and Netflix/HBO Go for movies), so the 500 GB storage space should be plenty for me. If I still require more, I've got a 500 GB external HDD sitting in my desk drawer that I can always break out. I've only ever used HDD, and I was totally blown away by the speed with which an SSD operates. I don't regret my decision whatsoever.

The bluray drive was a cost effective choice that I made. It wasn't totally necessary, but I watch a ton of movies, and I wasn't sure I wouldn't later regret losing the option to watch them on my PC in the future. So I spent the extra $20 or so it cost me to go with the bluray drive rather than just the DVD drive.

Here are the all important [pictures](http://imgur.com/a/J8IhY). Please note that I realize that these pictures are really rough, so I'll be adding a bit more photos in the future shot with a digital camera rather than my Samsung Galaxy Note. I'll try to get a finished shot of the case with better cable management, and the full battlestation itself.

That's about all I can think of at this point. Any other questions/comments/suggestions, please feel free to comment. Thanks for reading!

Thanks again, all!

The build was fairly straight forward with the exception of the power supply not being compatible with the Gigabyte board or Haswell Chip. I did an RMA through EVGA and like always got excellent support and quick RMA process. This alone is why I always will recommend EVGA. After receiving the new PS it installed with no issues and ran up. Since it has been up and running (which is about a week now) I have been having some issues with boot:
 **It will turn on then shut off and will not respond to the power button until I switch the power supply off and wait for power to be removed from the board.... Sometimes this works first try and sometimes it takes 5-10 tries. I don't know where to start. I have resetting all the BIOS and only changing the XMP profile for the memory. I cant tell if it is not getting the correct power cause of Haswell or if there is a component not working correctly causing the issue.**

Would love some direction because it is becoming increasingly frustrating. Other than that is has been awesome with little to no compatibility issues with programs and windows 8. Here is the reddit mark up!

1330623410.0,205,self.buildapc,qd5er,A Look at the Windows 8 Beta,287,82,406,http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/qd5er/a_look_at_the_windows_8_beta/,"Okay so the Windows 8 Consumer Preview (or as normal human beings call it, the beta) is now available and I thought I'd do a post walking people who haven't had a chance to down load it yet through the current features of it. 

**Bear in mind that being in beta stage the facts and information in this post are only accurate as of 1/3/12 and are subject to change before release and other stuff like that.**


Right then, the first most immediate change is the [Initial screen.](http://imgur.com/SvKdj,nAdj5,Nq83d,SX7UM,DPqsi,S40tX,7lcKT,5IzHH) (Apologies in advance for the first two images which were taken on my phone, the others are screenshots. I promise.) and the [Login screen](http://imgur.com/SvKdj,nAdj5,Nq83d,SX7UM,DPqsi,S40tX,7lcKT,5IzHH#1). The initial screen hasn't changed since the developer preview and works like a screen saver, you either drag it upwards with your mouse or click the up arrow on your keyboard to get to the login screen. The login screen is near enough the same as on previous versions of Windows- click on your account and enter the password.
One new addition to this is that your user account can be synced to your live account, as seen in the picture. (I rarely use the account shown, send me as much porn as you like.)

The next change is the [new start button](http://imgur.com/SvKdj,nAdj5,Nq83d,SX7UM,DPqsi,S40tX,7lcKT,5IzHH#7). It isn't really a button, but it does say start. (Top left hand corner if you don't believe me!) This is the new base of operations on Windows. Your own personal batcave of app storage... or, something. This page is intended to replace the standard desktop, it has live links to programs like mail (more on that in a second) and other programs that you can link to start page much like desktop icons on previous iterations.

[Right clicking](http://imgur.com/SvKdj,nAdj5,Nq83d,SX7UM,DPqsi,S40tX,7lcKT,5IzHH#2) and selecting [""more apps""](http://imgur.com/SvKdj,nAdj5,Nq83d,SX7UM,DPqsi,S40tX,7lcKT,5IzHH#3) takes you to this screen. This is a blown up version of the search menu on Vista and 7 and lists all of your programs, (Henceforth referred to as 'apps' despite how much I hate the phrase) you simply start typing to find a specific app.

For those who are grinding their teeth and warming up their email accounts of rage to complain to Microsoft about this monstrosity of a desktop they have created, whoa there! Calm down, it's actually a pretty seamless experience and the benefits of the experience outweigh the cons of having a fullscreen gadget bar. If that doesn't satiate your anger you can alsways click on the desktop button and see the [normal desktop view](http://imgur.com/SvKdj,nAdj5,Nq83d,SX7UM,DPqsi,S40tX,7lcKT,5IzHH#4). ^minus the start button for which you will have to use the start screen. As you can see rocketdock and rainmeter still function for those of you who roll that way.

So, back to the ""apps"" (&amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;). [The mail app](http://imgur.com/SvKdj,nAdj5,Nq83d,SX7UM,DPqsi,S40tX,7lcKT,5IzHH#5) is obviously intended to go up against [Mac Mail](http://cdn.zath.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/mac-lion-mail-conversation.png) (Terrible image I know, but you get the gist) and it doing so it does the job, I guess but as with most of these third party mail programs unless you have three or four accounts that you use daily it is really just easier to open up the hosts mail program in your browser.
I wont spend too much time showing you the apps because they all follow a similar design and too be honest a lot of them aren't available to test in the UK as of yet. The other one I'll show you is the [Photos](http://imgur.com/SvKdj,nAdj5,Nq83d,SX7UM,DPqsi,S40tX,7lcKT,5IzHH#6) app, this is pretty much just here as a taster of the way 8 will sync with different services that you may or may not use day to day.


So yeah, that's pretty much all I've got at the moment, depending on interest I may update further as I discover new things.

A few notes, it is a fast OS, I get boot times of 13-15 seconds (On a Crucial C300 SSD) and it is very snappy despite the visuals. Honestly though, it isn't any great improvement over 7 unless you buy into the whole app platform they are trying to base this around- an indicator to me that this is going to be a very touch and tablet based OS- expect to see touch screen monitors appearing on more pre-builds)

That's it, if you ~~wan't~~ **want- sorry ryanyahhh** to try it out for yourself you can get it [here](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-GB/windows-8/download) it can either be installed on top of 7 (You will need to format when the beta closes, or installed fresh onto a new drive.

If you want to tell me what you think of it, ask any questions, tell me to fuck myself or rag on my spelling or grammar you know what to do!


**Edit: There isn't a release date as of yet, but some sources are suggesting late 2012, around August- thanks LordAlfredo**

**You can pin running tasks to the side of the screen whilst running another app in the main body of the window (screens to come)**

**You can also install a lightweight version of the OS to a USB drive with ""Windows to Go"" - thanks Duraz0rz**

** ~~I can't find a source to confirm this~~ [Source!](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/b8/archive/2012/01/05/virtualizing-storage-for-scale-resiliency-and-efficiency.aspx) but a potential feature is the ability to link hard drives like a software RAID system called ""Storage Spaces"" -Thanks Mac3**

**A few people have mentioned that you can revert to a Win7 style desktop, if I found out how, or if anyone knows I'll update with screens.**

Other potential ""features are : low RAM usage (apparently 300mb idle), fast boot times and fast copy/cut/paste etc due to the new ""Protogon"" file system. If anyone knows what that means in English let me know!

The last feature is the inclusion of Kinect sensors in laptops that have apparently made it to a prototype stage. I honestly don't think I've heard anything more ridiculous in my life.

Just a quick note about things I bought and why I got them.

**UP4-** Great mobo for the price, color fit my build perfectly as well. One of the few non brown motherboards out there.

**RAM-** Pretty pricey for RAM, but it looked great and they were some of the only white sticks on the market. Besides, all RAM is expensive nowadays. 

**GPUs-** Was considering a single 780, but this was just as much, plus I get free 8 games, games I planned on buying anyway. Also, with 2011, why not get the extra card?

**800D**- A quick version of what I did to it is strip it down to bare metal with Aircraft remover, sand blast, sand with 10 different grits, dry and wet, primer, paint. Lots of work, and the process took forever. If you want details, I can get them for you. 

**Optical Drive-** Bought it from a friend for $15, she couldn't use it in her computer. Her return date passed so I thought I would help her out and buy it off her. 

**Monitor-** Got a pixel perfect version, it has no dead pixels, and no light bleed. Color is next to perfect, couldn't ask for anything better for the price.

**Mouse-** Planned originally getting a Blue Death Adder to match my keyboard, Best Buy was sold out of the old blue ones though, only the new green ones. Found the Sensei though for only $5 more (Paid $65 for the Sensei), and the only thing keeping me from getting a Sensei originally over a Death Adder was the price.

**Keyboard-** Wanted a back lit LED mechanical keyboard with blue switches. It fit the bill perfectly, lot of fun to type on. [Relevant post on /r/MechanicalKeyboards](http://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/11j20e/how_i_felt_after_buying_my_first_mechanical/)

**Lastly, Water Cooling-** Love the look and the quietness of it. Only doing the CPU, but bought something that will let me add my GPUs if I ever decide to. Would have gone with a cheaper kit had it not been for the fact that I may add my 7970s later, and that compression fittings came with this kit, the cheaper ones had barbs. I did buy white tubing separately, don't care for the clear that it comes with. 

I did my best to use the guide on how to take pictures of your computer that used to be found in the sidebar of /r/gamingpc, but I can't find it there anymore. If you would like to read the guide, [here it is.](http://www.overclock.net/t/912437/how-to-photograph-your-rig) I know my pictures aren't great by any stretch of the imagination, had a lot of missed focuses and lighting could be better for a few, but I like the way they came out nonetheless.

And finally last but not least- **PICTURES** [60 picture build log, it's quite the adventure.](http://imgur.com/a/3m8J0)

Anyways not knowing what to do first thing came to my mind pulling a McGuyver by using the lids from toothpaste. I asked my wife to buy 4 toothpastes of the same brand and screwed them where the legs are supposed to be. Here is an album : http://imgur.com/a/SLA9Y with 2 pictures :)

Anyway, after temporarily solving the problem, I got in touch with Fractal Customer Support and asked them how to obtain a new set of legs. In return they directed me to the spare parts webpage for Europe ( which is this link if anyone needs it: http://www.fractal-design-shop.de/ ) but, unfortunately I wasnt able to buy the legs right away, and four days later when I tried to purchase, they werent available. So I got back to the customer support asking if there is another way to get them, and lets be honest, these lids do the job but they are a shame to the whole pc building culture, and ta-daaa! they asked me the serial number and a proof purchase with my address and sent me the legs **FREE OF CHARGE**, even with priority mail and I received them 3 days later after.

I even did not have a very good proof of purchase and everything was in Polish language but they were still kind enough to do this, so I wanted to share their kindness with this community, hoping that some of you will appreciate it.

Last thing, this is my first post on reddit, so I am hoping that I am posting a self post like suggested in the rules, and if not sorry but this was more complex than I expected.",,False,,t5_2rnve,False,,,True,t3_1e28oq,http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/1e28oq/a_tale_of_very_very_good_customer_support_from/,

This is my second pc case that I have designed and made. 

It was inspired by the Aperture Science pc's from Portal. But it has a Raven inspired motherboard layout (90 degree rotated). It is also made from carbon fiber, the real stuff not that vinyl crap you sometimes see on cars.

From first thinking about the design to having it complete, it has taken about 1.5 years of working every other weekend. 

I had the aluminum frame welded by an engineer who likes to make prototypes so we spent a long time discussing the layout of the case and how to make it. The motherboard plate and ""rear plate"" came from a donor case but the hard drive bays, psu holder and fan holders were cnc cut and bent. I designed the molds for the carbon and had all that cut out of high density fiber board which I coated with sanding sealer and polished.

My dad builds yachts for a living so he helped me a lot with making all the carbon fiber stuff. (Quite a farther son bonding experience.)

And then finally I had all the bits sprayed with a high gloss epoxy.

The actual pc components are all just cheap, quiet and left over from my old pc. So now I have a cool looking media pc.
Not sure if this is the right place to put this but if you want to ask any questions I will try to answer them.

Hello everyone,

Just wanted to mention some feature updates I've rolled out to PCPartPicker recently:

&amp;nbsp;

**Completed Builds**

I've done a good bit of revamping of the completed build section.  There's more fun stuff to come here, but I figured I'd go ahead and mention what I've already pushed live:

* [Easily browse completed builds](http://pcpartpicker.com/parts/builds/) -- Now you can easily browse users completed builds, **with filters** for CPU, GPU, Case, etc.
* A Reddit Markup button (like with part lists) that will format your completed build with part list, links to the pictures, your description, as well as any specifications/temperatures/benchmark results you added.  As the markup language is the same as reddit, all your description text formatting will carry over automatically.
* Voting and commenting - vote completed builds up/down, leave comments, etc.
* Ability to document your overclocking amount, temperatures, 3DMark score, etc.
* Completed build part lists can now be edited/changed

**Saved Builds**

* Like completed builds, your saved builds can now be edited/changed.
* (Coming soon) The ability to annotate saved builds with notes.

**Commenting**

* Reddit-style comments are live on the site.  All completed builds and part pages can now be commented on.
* Like on Reddit, if someone replies to one of your comments, you'll see a blue envelope with the ""inbox"" count next to your username in the header.  Same applies if someone comments on your completed build.
* (Coming soon, like hopefully later today) If you have a completed build, it'll show up as a badge next to your username on your comments.

**Image Galleries**

* Image galleries for parts and completed builds should be considerably nicer now.  (No more loading every image in a separate tab, but a proper image browser finally.)

**Stickers**

* Not a feature, so to speak, but stickers are finally available.  Three different kinds: [(sample picture)](http://i.imgur.com/Z1ebM.jpg)
* I will happily send them to you for free (including internationally), or you can buy them from the new [PCPartPicker store](http://store.pcpartpicker.com).  The benefit to buying them instead of for free is that, like the T-shirts, 100% of the proceeds go to benefit Charity:Water.

**Also Coming Very Soon**

* The ability to enter prices for custom parts (and have their links show up)
* Mark parts as favorites so that they always percolate to the top of the list
* Mark parts as owned so that their prices are not counted toward your part list total.

&amp;nbsp;

I've got many more changes on the way.  I'm just coming to the end of week four of doing this full-time, so I've still got a lot of suggestions I'm busy trying to get worked into the site.  Thanks so much for all the feedback so far!

(Though feature improvements are going to have to brief break - UPS just arrived with a BitFenix Prodigy...)

&amp;nbsp;

Cheers,

Philip

So I'm in the market for a new build. 
I've been looking at around the £1000 mark, however, I'm flying to Korea next month (need to ask her father for permission to marry). I'll be staying for 2 weeks, so plenty of time. I've been there about 4 times before and can get by quite well. I know yongsan is the area for Tech...I'm just wondering if it'll be financially better to buy there or just stick with buying the parts in the uk as the warranty is easier to use (touch wood, i don't plan on needing the warranty) 

Edit*   Guys, you've been very helpful and can safely say I've learned a lot. Thanks to those that helped. 
I'm going to check out 1440p Monitors on ebay tbh, the idea of bringing it to uk on the plane is daunting, especially something that big. Will be on the look out for keyboards though.

I just wanted to remind everyone that before you post PLEASE look at the side bar, it will help you immensely with a starting point and figuring out a budget. if you are absolutely lazy and dont want to do your own research head on over to /r/buildapcforme and they will set you up with something. 

Also, when posting your build for critique please use PCpartpicker.com and use the reddit markup option for posting. it will make things much easier for us to look at your build and give you the help you need. 

if you are trying to compare graphics cards or decide which one to get, anandtech.com and tomshardware.com are 2 great sites with tons of reviews and benchmarks for you to gauge what level of FPS you will be able to run.

Im glad to see how much this Subreddit has grown since i subscribed and you have all helped me build what is now 3 PCs from budget rigs all the way up to more powerful gaming PCs.

A tag is a bit of text added to the front of a submission's title.  In our case, tags will be surrounded by square brackets, for example: [Troubleshooting].  When you add a tag to your submission, its title will change to a different colour.  This should hopefully help our readers to quickly identify the posts they want to read.

**Tagging Instructions**

Please add one of the four available tags infront of the submission title.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

* [](/buildhelp) [Build Help] means that you need help deciding what parts you should buy.
* [](/buildready) [Build Ready] means that you have chosen what parts you are going to buy, and you just want someone to look over the build before you go buy it.
* [](/buildcomplete) [Build Complete] means that you have completed your build and want to show it off (this usually involves pictures; please use imgur.com).
* [](/troubleshooting) [Troubleshooting] means that you are either having trouble putting together, or powering up your new build, and need someone to assist you.

Hi Everyone,


This is my first build! This subreddit has been incredibly helpful, so thank you everyone for indirectly contributing! 


Currently, I've got my i5 3570k overclocked to 4.5GHz @ 1.215V, temperatures seem OK, I never get anything above 70 degrees. I also tried overclocking my Gigabyte 7950 up to 1100/1400, but experienced some monitor disconnects randomly, so I think I'll just leave it at stock settings for now. Any advice on overclocking my GPU?


Feel free to let me know how I did!

I had never owned a computer but a friend of mine was in to Amiga's at that time. We talked allot about Computers and games But I didn't tell him that I was about to buy a computer soon. 

The day came and I ordered a PC. I drove up to the gas station my friend worked at and told him ""I have bought a computer!"". His eyes glowed and started to ask ""Did you buy an Amiga 2000 or perhaps a Amiga 3000"" or what ever numbers they had. I don't really remember now. And my response was ""no I bought a PC"". He looked at me like I had slapped him in the face and burst out ""You did not!!!"" Then a rant followed about how bad the pc was compared to just about anything.

A few days later A delivery truck stopped outside and in no time 3 boxes containing my pc was stacked in the hall. I sign and said goodbye to the delivery man. I looked at the boxes and rubbed my hands in anticipation and mumbled something about ""Ohh man Christmas is early this year. 

I hauled the boxes in to my room (I was living at my parent at the time.) and opened one of them. A paper at the top stated that when you assemble this computer the sockets only fit in one place so you can't get anything wrong. That sounded good as my knowledge about computers was low and I had no idea how a PC worked. 20 min later it was all connected up on my desk. ""Great now how do you turn this thing on. There have to be an on button somewhere, and I started to look. After pushing on anything that looked like it might be an on button. On the screen, on the keyboard and on the front of the pc. Nothing happed. After a careful examination of the pc I found a small red switch in the back. Time to push it I thought.

The desktop started to make sounds, the screen flicked to life. I read on the screen something about ""to enter setup press DEL"". Del, del, were is del... Ahhaa found i and pushed it. New thing's cam up on the screen. One row said ""Harddisk Utility""(or something) I've heard about that all programs is in the hard drive so that must be were I should go. Maneuver that blinking thing down to ""Harddisk Utility"". I push enter. A small sign pop up saying ""Do you really want to do this?"" I say something like ""Yes, Yes let me the hell in so I can start having fun with this thing. I maneuver the blinking thing to yes and push enter.

A new pop up with number 1 appear and it's counting 2, 3 ,4, and so on. some time later I understood that I formated my hard drive and erased everything on it. So there I sat with a new pc 386 sx16 with a 32mb hdd and 1 mb internal memory. And it's useless. Now every program that was installed also came on disks. First of MS-DOS 5.0 English version with a manual thick as a brick. I'm from sweden so reading that was... Hard.

Final price was 1622€, with the optical drive included. The graphics card I'm using is the EVGA GTX680 superclocked edition. I already own a Logitech G110 and a Razer Naga. I'm runing Windows7 Ultimate and have a 27inch LG monitor (I want to change it, colour quality is awful).

This was my first build ever, and so was my firt attempt at cable management. Hope you will like it ! This guy works smoothly and blazingly fast, pretty happy with the results! 

This was possible only thanks to you guys, you are all awesome !

My institution, Georgia Institute of Technology, for example gives every student in the College of Engineering virtually unlimited Microsoft Windows 7 keys for free through a partnership called the Microsoft Developer Network Academic Alliance (MSDNAA).  Before purchasing Windows from a retailer, find out if your university has one of these partnerships or a similar one.  Also, the Board of Regents in your state may offer extremely discounted Windows 7 as well.  If you have a copy of an old operating system, you can install it and then purchase the Windows 7 upgrade for an extreme discount from Microsoft's site http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msstore/pd/productID.216644200?Icid=Student_HUB_4up_Windows Also you may be able to use OnTheHub, which is an official partner of Microsoft: http://www.onthehub.com/ Finally, you can also receive free developer and server software from Microsoft's website http://www.dreamspark.com.  Finally, I suppose I can let you in on another secret.  For other software like Adobe products, you can receive .edu discounts from http://www.journeyed.com/

I hope you find this helpful and I can save you some money on software.

1361254692.0,192,self.buildapc,18sz1a,Beginner's Water Cooling Guide,222,30,85,http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/18sz1a/beginners_water_cooling_guide/,"**SuperLamington’s Watercooling Guide**



[**1. What is Watercooling?**](http://i.imgur.com/usRO9GJ.jpg)
Water cooling is the art of utilizing a series of waterblocks connected by tubing, with coolant flowing through it, to cool the CPU, GPU or Motherboard north/southbridge. RAM is sometimes watercooled, although this is usually fairly useless in terms of performance gain. 
A watercooling loop consists of: 

*	One or more radiators which dissipate heat from the coolant into the air
*	One or more waterblocks which draw heat from the CPU, GPU, or other, and transfer it to the coolant
*	A reservoir which is used to store coolant, fill the loop easily and has some air space so changes in pressure won’t  cause leaks
*	One or two pumps, to pump the coolant around the loop



**2. Why watercool?**
Watercooling can seem like a daunting task, and it is more expensive than air cooling, but it can be much more rewarding. The two most common reasons people watercool is to get better temperatures (in order to overclock effectively) and for aesthetics. I water cooled my computer mainly to overclock higher, but I also love the aesthetics of a nice loop. Watercooling also gives your computer much more personality – It shows how much effort you put in to making it look/perform, and since your PC’s looks are a bit of a ‘personal statement’ for many computer (hardware) enthusiasts, having a clean, impressive, watercooling loop is the icing on the cake.
Watercooling is also a lot of fun, both in choosing components, installation, getting it all up and running, and all that comes afterwards. The process is almost like building another computer, and we all know how much fun that is.



**3. Things to consider (i.e. cases, money, etc.)**
Watercooling is not for everyone – some people don’t think the maintenance, effort, risks or money are worth it. When thinking of getting a custom loop, you must to consider these things: 

1. How much you are willing to spend 
2. What components you want to cool
3. How much room you have in your case. (You must also take into account the support and space your case has for radiators and reservoirs, as they come in different shapes and sizes)

For about $150, you can get an XSPC RS240 kit which is all you need to get started. You also need to plan how/where you are going to place your radiator and reservoir. Most mid-tower cases can fit a 240mm or 280mm radiator at the top, a 120mm or 140mm at the back and sometimes a 240mm at the front. Some cases will require modding to fit radiators. You also need to decide on radiator thickness (which can cause clearance issues), and fans for the radiator.



**4. Brands**
The most prominent brands providing watercooling components/resources are: 
a)	EK
b)	Swiftech
c)	Koolance
d)	XSPC
e)	Watercool
f)	Phobya
g)	Alphacool
h)	Bitspower
i)	Monsoon
j)	Mayhem’s. 

A great place to check for performance reviews is [Skinnee Labs](http://www.skinneelabs.com/) and [Martin’s Liquid Lab](http://martinsliquidlab.org/)


Waterblocks:
When picking waterblocks for you components, you will want to consider performance, aesthetics, and price. The most established blocks on the market at the moment are 
a)	[EK Supremacy](http://www.ekwb.com/uploads/images/EK-Supremacy_NP_front_800.jpg)
b)	[XSPC Raystorm](http://www.xs-pc.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/raystorm-intel-11.jpg)
c)	[Koolance CPU-380](http://koolance.com/image/cache/data/products/cpu-380i_p1-700x700.jpg)
d)	[Swiftech Apogee](http://www.swiftech.org/images/products/detail/APOGEE-HD-WT.jpg)
e)	[Watercool Heatkiller](http://watercool.de/sites/default/files/produktversionen/14051.jpg)

The XSPC Raystorm currently has the best performance for price; and the the EK Supremacy has best performance, for CPU cooling to date.

There are two types of graphics cards water blocks – full cover and GPU-only


When looking at Motherboard North/Southbridge waterblocks, you will need to make sure that your motherboard is compatible with the blocks you are buying. 

**Remember, waterblocks require thermal paste/compound.**


**Radiators:**
The [radiator](http://www.alphacool.com/images/product_images/popup_images/1030_0.jpg) (commonly abbreviated as ‘Rad’) cools the water by dissipating the heat from the coolant. Without the radiator, the coolant would keep heating up. Radiators come in many sizes, starting as small at 80mm (quite rare), with the average size being 120-360mm, designed for 120mm fans. I would recommend having about 120mm of rad space for every component being cooled; but Motherboards and RAM are an exception as they don’t produce very much heat comparatively. For radiators, skinnee labs have good testing and reviews. I personally have an XSPC EX360 and am very happy with it. I have also heard good things about Alphacool, EK and Black Ice radiators.

There are two measurements important with radiators: thickness and fpi. Thickness is how thick the radiator is and therefore directly affects cooling surface area; and fpi is folds per inch. Radiators are long, narrow, but tall tubes with thin metal connecting to tubes like corrugated iron. To put it simply, radiators with a low fpi require only slower fans, but perform not as well, and radiators with high fpi require fast, and therefore often noisy, fans, but can perform better. Thick radiators have generally low fpi and thin radiators almost always have high fpi.


To decide on radiator sizing, you will need to consider what you will be cooling. A rough estimate is 120mm of radiator space per CPU or GPU you will be cooling. Motherboard components don't need a huge amount of cooling
so allowing 120mm of space for all the motherboard blocks combined should be fine. You can do a more accurate estimate by calculating the total TDP (thermal design power). This is a calculation of the heat output of components. To find it, simply good ""[part name] TDP"". Add the TDP's of all the components in the loop and that is the cooling power you will need. 360mm radiators dissipate about 500-700 watts of heat. Radiator heat dissipation can be found by searching online. 

[FPI Comparison](http://www.pmptech.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/FPI-Comparison.png)



**Pump:**
The pump is very important in a loop as it pushes the coolant through the system. Without a pump, the coolant wouldn’t move and thus the system would overheat. There are two main versions of pumps available, the [DDC](http://www.ekwb.com/shop/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/5e06319eda06f020e43594a9c230972d/l/a/laing-ddc.jpg) and the [D5](http://www.swiftech.com/images/products/detail/MCP655.jpg). Both pumps are made by Liang, and all the other brands simply relabel them. The exception is the [Swiftech MCP35x](http://www.swiftech.org/images/products/detail/MCP35X-BKX600.jpg), which is a custom DDC by Swiftech.’Flow’ is how quickly the water flows through the system, and ‘Head’ is how much pressure the pump puts out.

The D5 pump has more flow but less head than the DDC, this means it is better for systems with one to three waterblocks. If the system has three waterblocks or more, it would be better to have a DDC pump. Some people like to have two pumps in succession, so that if one pump fails, the loop still works. Two pumps also increases head a little.

The stock D5 pump has 1/2 barbs and the stock DDC has 3/8 barbs. You can get aftermarket pump tops which give a little better flow and have G1/4 ports instead of barbs. The Swiftech MCP35x comes with an non-stock top.



**Reservoir:**
The reservoir is one of the optional (although highly recommended) components of a water cooling loop. The reservoir is fairly simple – it stores coolant and has some air in it to compensate for pressure changes. A t-line can be substituted for a reservoir, although they are hardly used anymore and I would not recommend one as they are just a pain to work with. The reservoir makes the filling of the loop significantly quicker and easier. It also looks great. It is important for there to be some air in the reservoir which can compress and decompress with changes in pressure (often caused by heat).

There are two main types of reservoirs – [tube reservoirs](http://www.ekwb.com/uploads/images/ek-multioption-x2-res-advanced1_600.jpg) and [bay reservoirs](
http://koolance.com/image/cache/data/products/tnk-501_p1-700x700.jpg). Almost all reservoirs are clear or have clear sections to show coloured coolant. Tube reservoirs are a long acrylic tube with a cap on either end, and there are also tube reservoirs which attach directly to a pump. The fittings screw into holes in the caps.

Bay reservoirs are small, box-like tanks which fit into the 5.25 inch bays. They come in one and two slot versions, some being about to connect to pumps directly. They often have a spot for a LED to be put in to illuminate the coolant. 
Reservoirs are personal preference as to which style is used. Generally pumps attached to reservoirs are easier and give a cleaner look to the loop as less tubing is used.




**Tubing and fittings:**
Tubing connects all the components in the loop together and comes in two main sizes: 1/2 inch (12.7mm), 3/8 inch (9.5mm) and 7/16 inch (11.1mm). 1/2 inch and 3/8 inch tubing are more common and 1/2 inch tubing is sometimes used on 7/16 fittings to get an even better seal. Sometimes people use hard acrylic tubes or metal tubes and plug fittings instead of normal tubing. Fittings are what the tubing connects to. They come in two types: [barb fittings](http://www.watercoolinguk.co.uk/images/product_images/large/bp-14-13-barb-1l.jpg), and [compression fittings](http://cdn.overclock.net/3/3e/3e521c25_WP_000122.jpeg). Almost all fittings have a G1/4 inch thread.


**Fittings**


Barb fittings are basically the same as the gas taps in chemistry labs. It is highly advisable to use clamps with barb fittings to make sure the tubing doesn’t fall off. This shouldn’t be an issue as the barbs are bigger than the tubing (some people like 7/16 tubing on 1/2 barbs so they don’t have to use clamps). A clamp can be a zip-tie, a commercial metal or plastic clamp or even a hose clamp from the hardware store.

Compression fittings are basically a barb and clamp all in one. The tube goes onto a barb, and a metal ring screws on top of it. The main brands for compression fittings are Monsoon and Bitspower, although there are a few others which are also good.

If you want to use hard acrylic or copper tube for your loop, you will need to get push fittings. Push fittings are basically a hole with two o-rings, so when the tube is pushed into the fitting, it has a good seal. The downside for these is that they are easier to have a leak and the tubing must be perfectly straight in the fittings. If they are not straight, there will be a leak. You can either use Bitspower Crystal Link for pre-made acrylic tube, or you can cut and bend you own tubing.

There are also a few other miscellaneous fittings including [quick-disconnects](http://koolance.com/image/content_pages/product_help/quick_disconnects/qdc_pair_disconnected.jpg), [t-junctions](http://www.coolercases.co.uk/acatalog/hi-flow_t_200.jpg), [angled adaptors](http://www.thewatercoolingshop.co.uk/images/D/64276_0.jpg), [taps](http://cdn2.specialtech.co.uk/spshop/files/detail1/bitspower/wazu_235_1g.jpg), [rotary adaptors](http://www.thewatercoolingshop.co.uk/images/D/64166_0.jpg) and [SLI fittings](http://koolance.com/image/cache/data/products/cnt-vda2-bk_p2-700x700.jpg). Quick-disconnects are two fittings with a compression on either end which join together, when they are disconnected (twist and pull), the coolant doesn’t leak out and it just makes draining loops easier. T-junctions are a block with three G1/4 inch female holes, often used in conjunction with a tap for draining loops easily. Angled adaptors are metal tubing at an angle which has one male and one female hole, rotary adaptors are angled adaptors which can rotate. One should be cautious when buying a non-rotary angled fitting as it might be the wrong orientation when screwed in. SLI fittings are a male to male threaded straight adaptors which have an adjustable length.

**Tubing**
When buying tubing, you will need to look at the inner diameter and the outer diameter of the tube. The inner diameter is the diameter of the inside of the tube, and the outer diameter is the diameter of the whole tube. Barb fittings will accept any tubing with the same inner diameter for which the barb is design for. Compression fittings, however, require a specific inner diameter and outer diameter. If you take your time and double check, you will be fine. Plug fittings require only a specific outer diameter.

Another thing to consider when buying tubing is the type of tubing you buy. Tygon, Masterkleer and Durelene tubing are the ones which are recommended. Other brands of tubing have plasticizer added to the plastic. This plasticizer will build up gunk on the inside of the tubing. Other brands of tubing also cloud up and stain quicker.

**Coolant:** 
Coolant is a highly debated aspect of water cooling. People deliberate on which coolant looks the best, has the least impact on your loop (dye staining) and has the best performance.
Distilled/de-ionized water is used in water cooling loops, because it is pure water without additives, with a biocide or silver coil added. This mixture doesn’t stain blocks and has very good performance. Biocide is a liquid mixture you can buy which kills microscopic life in the coolant and prevents them from growing. The two main brands are: 

-	Primochil Liquid Utopia 
-	Mayhem’s biocide
-	PT Nuke

 Silver kill coils are very pure silver strips bent into a coil shape which kill microscopic life inside the loop.
The coolant with the best performance is Dragon Ice Coolant mixture, which is de-ionized water with biocide, as well as nanoparticles mixed in to transfer heat better. Most pre-mixed coolants are worse than just using distilled water and biocide. Many will advertise the fact that they are “non-conductive”, however all coolants are as they used distilled water, this non-conductive property will wear off over time.

Hi BaPC! 

You know that great feeling you get when you feel like you've accomplished something amazing? It's the first time in a while I've felt it, and it's all thanks to you guys.

It's been about two and a half months since I built my first PC. I just really wanted to say thank you for being such an awesome and helpful subreddit. I lurked here for about 3-4 months before I got the courage to go out and buy parts. Even though it was a little scary during the build, I felt so prepared because all of the great comments and inputs on pretty much every single thread here. 

I will never forget that feeling of the first time my PC booted into the BIOS; it was one of the proudest moments in my life, and it was all because of you.

This is a self post, so I'm not here for the karma. I just wanted to say thank you, straight from the bottom of my heart. I'm so grateful that this amazing community exists. 

Keep being super awesome!

Well, what can I say? It's finally finished! I'll start with a huge thank you to everyone at /r/BuildaPC and /r/BuildaPCforMe. There is no way I could have done this without you. Special shoutouts to /u/filleman123, /u/DragonFlyer123 and /u/thekeeno who were particularly helpful when it came to suggesting build ideas. I might post some benchmarks later on, but for now, all I can say is thank you!

* PC
* PC + Monitor

If I do a search for a $600 budget build, almost every single one has no Monitor/OS.

Now if I search for $1000 builds, the results start to change. Monitors, OS, peripherals all start appearing in much greater numbers. Nearly every post has at least one monitor.

The trend continues at higher prices. I'm sure you have all seen the same $2000 builds that have three monitors and a pricey mechanical keyboard.

My point is that those ""budget"" $600 builds are not comparable to the $1000 builds, and often times the $1000 cannot really be compared to the $2000 build, and calling them such is very misleading. I'm not sure I have an answer to how this can be rectified, or at least mitigated, but I think it needs to be said out loud.

Really old. So I remember the days when Intel had different names between different processor sets and it was easy to know that the new ones would be better. When I upgraded to a 286, I knew that it would be faster. But now I'm confused.

I currently have a 2009 quad core i5 (2.66Ghz). I'm looking at a machine that has a 2012 Ivy Bridge quad core i5 (2.6Ghz). So the Ghz number hasn't gone up, and it's still an i5. 

There aren't any more gigahertzes and there aren't any more I numbers. It's not like it went i5 to i9 or 2.66Ghz to Eleventy.12Ghz. There aren't any more cores (still 4, and no HT because it's i5)

So what are the differences? Where is the best place to find comparisons between different generations / year's chips ? 

And does this confuse anyone else? 

*Edit* - it turns out that I meant a 2.6Ghz i7, not i5 - thanks to Charwinger21 for pointing this out.
That means that it has 2 more Is :) But that's just the difference between HT and no HT, right ? Or are there any virtualisation bits on the i7 too ?

I always blamed it on NVIDIA being hot cards, especially the 2xx series, but come on... THIS hot? 105°? I could boil water on that shit.

Opened it up about half a year ago to clean out dust and re-apply the [TIM \(Thermal Paste\)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_grease), but I never took off the plastic cover from the heatsink (dunno why).

This time I did, though. [This is what I found. (NSFPC)](http://i48.tinypic.com/218kk8.jpg)

&gt;From their [site](http://www.arcticsilver.com/as5.htm):

&gt;**Not Electrically Conductive:**

&gt;Arctic Silver 5 was formulated to conduct heat, not electricity.

&gt;(While much safer than electrically conductive silver and copper greases, Arctic Silver 5 should be kept away from electrical traces, pins, and leads. While it is not electrically conductive, the compound is very slightly capacitive and could potentially cause problems if it bridges two close-proximity electrical paths.)

Here's some basic things builders should know:

* A good case is always worth it. Having one with good cooling potential (water/air) will reduce noise and temperatures and will increase the lifespan of your components. It doesn't make sense to put $800 worth of components in a $30 case (With exceptions). A great case will last several builds.

Here are some features that make a good case:

* Cable management holes - without it, you're living in the 90's. Keeping your cables in good order and out of sight is not only aesthetically pleasing, it greatly helps in airflow. The bigger the better. 

* Perpendicular drive bays - This makes swapping out hard drives much easier especially if you have something in the pci slots that are in the way such as a video card.

* Screw-less drive mounts - For 5.25"" bays these are fantastic, as they make installing anything a 1 finger operation.  3.5"" drives that use mounts make installation of hard drives super easy. Some case designs have 2.5"" adapters but so far I haven't seen a case that has screw-less 2.5"" bays.

* Dust filters - A minor convenience. Some people don't like them because they impede airflow but most of the time they are removable.

These are minor details. More often than not if the case has the above features it will have these:

* Case stands (Or wheels) - This allows you to place your PSU fan side down so the fan pulls air from under the case instead of pulling hot air from inside (If this is the case, don't place them on carpet since they'll be sucking up dust. Place them on a hard surface instead).

* Rear water cooling grommets - Even if you think it's no good now, a case with good upgrade potential is worth every penny. Closed CPU water cooling loops are getting more and more popular, and there is a chance you may need to mount it on top of the case.

* Thumbscrews - The more the merrier. They don't have to come stock but in my opinion everyone can benefit from a [bag or 2](http://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.aspx?Submit=ENE&amp;N=40000255&amp;IsNodeId=1&amp;Description=thumbscrews&amp;name=Case%20Accessories&amp;Order=BESTMATCH). Note that Lian Li cases have a proprietary size for screws in their cases, and would not work.

* Painted interior - Also a minor detail, but if you care that much you can always paint it yourself (It's not that hard).

In my own opinion, the best cases are in this order (Prices based on Newegg, not including shipping. Always check other sites first):

**On case fans** - When choosing a case, if sound is a concern then picking ones with 200mm options are recommended. Bigger fans have lower rpm but push a good amount of air. If sound isn't a concern then go with ones that have high cfm. Some people go for group buys on fans that are extremely rare like the Scythe Gentle Typhoon because they're so efficient. If you really want to go overboard Delta makes server grade fans that push an insane amount of air (Not recommended unless you know what you're doing). 

Usually the general consensus for how to design airflow is to have intake fans from the side and front with exhaust fans at the back and the top. This is known as neutral pressure. Having more exhaust than intake results in negative pressure. Achieving efficient negative pressure is extremely difficult and uncommon. Having more intake fans is known as positive pressure. Positive pressure results in (Supposedly) lower temperatures, reduced amount of dust and better airflow overall.

Convection (hot air rises) is not to be considered a factor. Even the slowest moving fan will move air faster than heat rising naturally. Also, if a case has a fan option behind the motherboard it's definitely worth it to use it as cooling the cpu on the backplate can really reduce temperatures.

If you plan on buying aftermarket fans buy them with your build and install them before the other parts as it makes it a lot easier, especially with larger fans.

**On cable management** - It matters, a lot. Cables that aren't managed or cluttering up the interior of a case block airflow, looks bad and makes it especially harder for maintenance and troubleshooting. Wider cases are especially helpful as they make it much more forgiving when attempting to close the side panel for the first time.

For me, the first thing I do when installing a psu is pull every single wire through to the back side. If everything is done right, there is no cable that cannot be routed and managed behind the motherboard. One of the most important things in cable management is making sure none of the large cables overlap. If nothing runs over or under the 24pin then managing the cables will be a lot easier. Also don't be afraid to use every zip tie available to you. Just be sure to plan things out several steps ahead. [This picture](http://i.imgur.com/wPlD5.jpg) (Nemesis158 with the NZXT Beta Evo) is a textbook example of fantastic cable management.

So I would just like to reiterate the PSA - **DO NOT BUY THIS BOARD for 8XXX series CPUs.** 6XXX are apparently hit and miss if you do not OC them.

As stated before, there is a VRM over-heating issue with this board running most 8-core AMD processors, even at out-of-box speeds. My 8350 was throttled to 1.4Ghz during every test when the vcore would drop to 0.888v. There is a fix for this if you already own it, and are having these issues. The easiest method is to put a fan blowing directly onto the VRM heatsink, or replace the stock VRM heatsink.

Other than that, if you just bought the board, I would suggest returning it for the UD5 or something else. You will end up spending the difference in cash between the two boards in fans and heatsinks in order to get the UD3 working properly. I just went through this whole issue, and thought I would save anyone looking into this board some frustration. I just replaced the UD3 with the UD5 and now I'm stable at 4.5Ghz with no overheating or vcore drops.

**I would also like to add that this issue mainly affects the current Rev 3.0 of this board. They have released Rev. 4.0 (with a beefy VRM heatsink) but people who ordered from newegg this week are still getting Rev 3.0 - so either wait and see if the problem is fixed all together - or get the UD5 or something else.**",,False,,t5_2rnve,1375409643.0,,,True,t3_1jioo0,http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/1jioo0/psa_do_not_buy_the_990fxaud3_for_68core_amd_cpus/,

 So I have been thinking of putting a nice custom WC loop in my PC but have been unable to do so as all the space was filled with 10 damn hard drives storing all my media. So I thought it was high time to move the main raid all out of home into their own cozy little enclosure, I toyed with the idea of a pre-built NAS of some type from one of the big name companies like Synology or Qnap but in the end settled on building one myself and saving 500 or so bucks, also I love building PCs and have very little experience with Unix and thought it would be a good learning experience. I already had the Hard Drives (all WD RE4s) and an Adaptec 6805 raid controller card (which is rendered moot by the fact I am using software raid...but meh) so I threw the rest of the parts together (after a bit of lurking on the FreeNAS forums for parts advice) and slapped FreeNAS on the USB stick and now I have a great little NAS sitting under my desk serving up all my media and files to my HTPC and PC. FreeNAS was relatively painless to get working with only minimal effort required to get it working with my raid card and the software setup was a breeze. I am running the 7 HDDs in Raid-Z (similar to Raid-5) giving me a total of 10.5TB of storage. The only thing I still want to do is to somehow hook up a LCD screen to the front to display the current Free Space/Network Usage/Alerts and such but I'm running into a few issues there so if anyone has any experience getting an LCD screen working in FreeNAS or FreeBSD I would love some advice.

Before I say anything else, [here](http://imgur.com/a/snkYb) are the pics.

For those wondering why the motherboard mysteriously changes half way through the build, I had to RMA my X79-UP4 twice, and after the second time decided to switch to an ASUS P9X79 instead.

I'd like to give a big thanks to those who helped me through my fast array of issues, specifically when adding the watercooling. It took me over a month before I got everything working the way it should. Special shout out to MarkRobbo and Alfaa in the IRC.

Here are some of the initial benchmarks: http://imgur.com/a/tbRdd , http://www.3dmark.com/cg/567404

You'll notice all the LED variations at the end. This is thanks to the NZXT Hue controller, which I highly recommend for those looking to add some LED. I'm also having trouble deciding on a color, so I'd like to let you guys decide before my GF forces me to keep the hot pink...

**Edit:** Huge thanks to NZXT for featuring my build on their [facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153001563005301&amp;set=a.220281835300.271899.17437970300&amp;type=1&amp;theater).

1370935458.0,190,self.buildapc,1g3vwj,"[Discussion] PSA: With all these ""OMG consoles are cheaper than PCs threads"", Please remember that you save hundreds of dollars on games with a PC",273,83,122,http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/1g3vwj/discussion_psa_with_all_these_omg_consoles_are/,"Why?

**Reasons:**

**#1.**New AAA titles go down much quicker than the same games do on consoles. I suggest browsing /r/gamedeals because there are some  incredible prices on brand new games.

**#2.** Bundles. Bundles Bundles Bundles Bundles. Examples include [Humble Bundle](https://www.humblebundle.com/), [Indie Royale](http://www.indieroyale.com/), [Indie Gala](http://www.indiegala.com/), and lots more

**#3.** Indie Games. There are exponentially more games by developers that don't make it to console. The vast majority if these are less than $10.

**#4.** Free to play games. There are thousands of them. MMOs, FPSs, RTSs, you name it. I mean the most popular games in the world are free to play(Dota/LoL).

**#5.** Steam. Steam summer and winter sales used to be by far the best times to get games. Now they almost seem lackluster with the crazy prices amazon and Greenman Gaming have constantly been having. They still have sales every day/weekend though that can entice even those with hundreds of titles in their library.

**#6.** Free games with hardware purchases. These have gotten better and better over the last few years and you see it with amazing AAA titles that come with almost any video card you purchase. Other pieces of hardware often come with games as well like the free SimCity promotion that is going on with APUs currently.

These are all purely economical reasons to go with a PC over a console for gaming. Obviously there are plenty of other factors like convenience(you never have to go to the store to buy ANY PC game), better support(more patches), broader selection of games(I dont see any console MMOs), and plenty of other arguable factors that make it the better choice for gaming if only one can be purchased.

I just wanted to make sure that people realize that just because the up-front cost for a system is cheaper, doesnt make it the more cost-effective buy. Shoot I know plenty of people that only play F2P games that have never payed a dime for a PC game. You can't say that about many console gamers.

**Edit**: I want to make it clear that this is not a thread for talking about why PCs are better than consoles. Take that type of foolish banter to /r/PCmasterrace. Obviously the general consensus here is that most of us prefer to game on PCs. The purpose of this is strictly to provide people with reasons why it could very well be cheaper to game on a PC than a console even though the initial costs may be higher. 

Also thank you /u/ultisup for reminding me about emulators, another great cost-efficient way to game on a PC.

- the placement of power supply at the bottom. I didn't know when this trend started, but back in my day most power supplies were on top. It's a PITA to have built my PC's this way I now realize. This simple innovation really makes a big difference. Edit: the improvement in thermals that it brings is also noteworthy.

- cable management. Again a simple innovation that makes a big difference. Wow a few millimeters at the back of the motherboard base gets rid of spaghetti wires! Whoduthunkit?

This is find interesting and comforting at the same time:

- that not much has really changed. Motherboard, case, GPU, CPU, RAM, hard drive, power supply, monitor, mouse, keyboard, and...internal optical disk! - the same basic components which in my day my fellow builders would discuss on end. Gee I wonder if kids in 2020, 2030 would still be arguing these parts? 

I'm glad that CD drives are still alive though. As a 90's kid I would really be sad if CD and DVD games would go away and we go all digital download distribution :(

Sad face moments:(

- Cyrix is gone! The budget processor of my time. And Voodoo is gone too! Voodoo was a beast in it's heyday. 

And I wonder who is the VIA processor today? Ie, crap processor :)

What do you find surprising with the current PC building industry? I personally find it mostly positive.

Yes, I know this is way overkill, but I wanted something that would last a long time. I know a 690 would have been a better choice than 3 670s, but I could not find one in stock for the life of me. This was so much fun to build, I wont be buying anymore prebuilts! I hope you guys like it, thanks for all of the help BaPC provided! :D Also, love the SSD's! If you have any questions feel free to ask! Got any ideas for a name?

So after 4 months of sales and long debate of what to get I have finished my build. Her name is Zadeaquil Epsilon or just Zade.


I have been doing a lot of video editing, 3d modeling, and gaming and I have to say this thing is awesome. [Here](http://imgur.com/a/tcTd2) are some [renders](http://i.imgur.com/wPNef.jpg) I made. As for games I've been able to run max settings on everything so far.

I have it overclocked to 4.5Ghz and it is nice and cool. I got some awesome custom sleeved cables from Dazmode. As the video shows I did some other cool mods too.

I am by NO MEANS a pro. I am not even that good, but I am willing to answer questions, because I do know a lot about the sport.

I specialize in overclocking AMD products (Phenom II onwards, no K8 sorry). But I have also worked with some intel stuff (1156, 1155 mostly as you can see from my HWbot)

I would rather answer questions about **components** than give overclocking advice. Each setup is different, so what I suggest about overclocking technique may work for some people, but hurt others.

I wanted to let you know that I've added a new feature to the PCPartPicker part list:  you can now include custom / unlisted parts.

Any custom and unlisted parts will be added to the PCPartPicker database when possible, and any part lists that referencing them will update automatically with current merchant and pricing information.

To add custom parts, look for the ""Custom"" section in the part list, and click the ""Add Custom Part"".  Then you'll see two fields to enter for the name and an optional URL to the part in question.

I went with the X-79 chipset to allow for future upgrades.

The gtx-680 is because I use Adobe CS, and I wanted the computer to support 3d if I so choose.

I plan on adding 2 more sticks of RAM to make use of the quad-channel the X79 platform supports.

I also plan on adding another GTX680 down the line.

Finally, I plan on getting two more 24' monitors to allow for a surround setup. Currently I'm just using the ASUS vg248qe and an old Dell LCD from a previous computer as an accessory display.

I haven't overclocked the CPU, RAM, or GPU yet, but I plan to at some point this week.

I wanted to maintain a black/white color scheme, and threw in an NZXT hue for some lighting effects. The white works well with the HUE because it kind-of picks up whatever color the HUE is putting out, allowing for a good variety of colors depending on my mood.

The Ducky Shine and Sensei RAW also have white back-lighting, which compliments the system nicely!

I wanted to thank /r/buildapc for all your help, and give a shout-out to Markrobbo who helped me work out the pcpp list.

Thanks again.

Basically one night I was blasting away enemies in Bad company 2, all of a sudden my screen turned grey with lines, strange I thought (CPU was slightly over clocked so I assumed it was that and restarted). To be on the safe side I checked what the temps were and my CPU was at 116c...yes Celsius! The pump on the h50 stopped and the water inside started boiling and blew up inside my case, damaging my HD5850, Asus donation essence stx sound card and my motherboard. Long story short I filed a complaint on the website and they called ME, I was so surprised. The Guy on the phone was super helpful and human(we talked about games for a good 20 minutes). 

They sent me a replacement H80, an SSD as a good will gesture and a $400 check :)! Below is the original thread I made about the situation on another forum in detail.

It's the constant and instant recommendation of the 6950 merely for the ability to ""unlock"" into a 6970.

While you can unlock a small percentage of 6950s into 6970s (which is actually somewhat misleading, you're simply unlocking a couple extra shaders; it's becoming far rarer with newer models of the 6950) this should not be the basis for your recommendation of the 6950. The 6950 needs to be recommended based off of price versus performance. 


You have the high end 2GB models for the 6950 coming in at around ~$260, and the 6970 coming in at around ~$350. So with that in mind, heres a quick comparison between the two: http://www.anandtech.com/bench/Product/292?vs=293

Now you can clearly see the difference is ridiculously minimal (maybe a 5% difference in total). Now given an overclock to reference 6970 speeds on say the high end sapphire 6950, you'll end up with pretty much the same FPS as the 6970 on any game you're playing.
Example: http://www.guru3d.com/article/msi-r6950-twin-frozr-ii-oc-review/22

The above needs to be referenced far more than the spewing of unlocked shaders comments - to prove my point: http://www.overclock.net/t/946027/hd6950-shader-unlock-gaming-comparison 

Edit: Wanted to add this regarding unlocking the cards:
Also as far as unlocks go, unless they have a specific bios switch, I typically find the risk vs reward unacceptable (the unlock by itself is worth about a 3% gain in performance, which amounts to about 1 FPS). These unlock recommendations are also made to new PC builders, and perhaps folks less knowledgeable on this subject, so the point is completely lost on them.

I'm going to also take a quick second to also point out one other thing that I've seen here recently and is a little misleading.

2GB cards vs. 1GB cards.

Now, if you game above 1080p, yes there will be a difference as you get in to the higer ranges of resolution, especially with multiple monitor setups. If you don't, there is almost zero need, given modern games right now, to get a 2gb card (Dont reference crysis, this is a cop-out, especially on a poorly optimized engine, battlefield 3 is a better comparison tool now).
Reference: http://www.hwcompare.com/6216/radeon-hd-6950-vs-radeon-hd-6950-2gb/ 
Now the argument also comes up, well what about future proofing? To answer that, if you're on a budget, you will never be able to future proof your computer. The best you can do is save yourself time and money and buy something for your needs now.

This isn't meant to be disrespectful, I'm merely attempting to clear the air of some misinformation that gets regurgitated, simply because everyone else is regurgitating it.

Anyway I originally built on a tight budget in fall of 2011, before I had much know-how or found bapc.  Despite that I think it still turned out alright for the price (Rough parts list below).  Lived with the build in that state for about 9 months or so upgrading a couple parts here and there.  I was able to get a new job and had some extra money so decided to venture into something I've always found very exciting and intriguing: water cooling.  Scoped out parts for months before finally pulling the trigger and putting it together.  First go round was very amatuer and sloppy looking, and as a result I put more effort into it, along with learning how to sleeve cables, and came out with a product I am very happy with, albeit still very amatuer.  But there is still plenty of work left for me to do on it (Better sleeving/custom cabling, painting the ap-15s, proper res mount and less ugly pump kit).

Cpu very midly overclocked to 3.8ghz, have tried pushing 4ghz but won't go without a voltage I'm not safe with + bad mobo/cpu lotto i guess

Gpu overclocked to 1225mhz core at 1.25v with 1725 mem clock; only frustrating part for me here was that my card has alot of vdroop, drops to like 1.18v underload

  
Temps relative to ambient room temp Celcius

Idle Temps:    
Water: +5-7  
Gpu: +10-15  
Cpu: +10

Load Temps:     
Water: +10-15  
Gpu: +20-25  
Cpu: +15

Certainly not the best temperatures but I attribute that to the fact I have one rad as intake and the other as exhaust.  After adding push/pull on the ut60 I got a very nice 5C temp drop, really surprised me but it seems rads over 60mm thick really require that extra pressure to get the air through them.  Should be noted that I keep all fans at 1,000 RPm or under, silence is great.    




Original Build:

Cpu - Phenom 2 x4 840 (Upgraded to 1090t few months later)  
Mobo - Asus M5a97 AM3+
Ram - some 2x2g PNY Kit, gave to a friend for server build and don't remember model/speed  
Gpu - xfx black edition 6850, added a gigabyte 6850 with 1090t  
Psu - Ocz modxstream 700w    
Case - Rosewill Smart one midtower  
Hdd - 500g barracuda

Original price: ~450

Alright, here's the deal. First off, this is a text post so IIRC, no Karma to be whoring. :P

I'm not sure how to do this really, but not a day/week goes by that I don't read about some kid [usually] who has saved up forever to build a PC and quite frankly, I would like to help them a little bit. So for Christmas [I wanted to do this a couple days ago but life got in the way] I figured that I would give away my old video card.

Unless someone has a better way, what I'm wanting is a picture of your current video card with some kind of 'proof' attached, like a picture with your Reddit handle and the date or something. Maybe a Dxdiag/Afterburner/Catalyst/Whatever screenshot. Then from that, I'll assign the names a number and put it in a random number generator. From there, I'll message [and post, obviously] the winner and get shipping information. Note: Shipping is on me, too.

I'll collect names from here on New Years Eve probably early afternoon [4-6pm PST]. Again, if someone has a better way of doing this [considering how jumbled Reddit comments can be], please let me know. :D 

Also, **please post your picture as a comment to this and not a comment to another comment so it's not such a pain in the butt for me to sort through**.


**Full Disclosure:**
While I have absolutely no reason to believe that this card is not functional [it worked just fine when I pulled it; I just upgraded to 570s], it has not been installed in a computer in over six months and in that time, I have moved from Texas to California and then once again in California. The entire time it has sat in a drawer, in a static bag with some padding so it didn't get knocked about too badly. I'm sure someone will ask that I test it and I apologize if this comes across as lazy [which I'll admit, it kind of is] but I would really rather not pull my computer apart just to test a card that I'm 99.9% certain is functional.",,False,,t5_2rnve,True,,,True,t3_nqpuk,http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/nqpuk/christmas_give_away_gtx460/,

Two week countdown edition!,216,33,202,http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/1en16c/haswell_and_ivy_bridgee_info_and_faq_two_week/,"This post has been copy+pasted from the original thread. Any information introduced in the second thread will be put into quotations, and any info new to this thread will be in double quotes.

Socket and Chipset Changes:

- **Socket 1150**  
Haswell will be on the socket 1150 platform, meaning you won't be able to drop one of these chips in your current motherboard.  
&gt;&gt; Socket 1150 is expected to have a 2-year lifespan, including the Haswell and Broadwell chipsets. Skylake, following Broadwell, will require a socket change.

- **USB 3.0**  
Haswell's USB controller is supposed to be able to achieve the maximum 10Gb/s that USB 3.0 promised. So far, we've only been able to achieve 5Gb/s on current platforms.

- **PCIe Lanes**  
Haswell will not be able to run 16x/16x on PCIe 3.0. This was obvious, because the amount of pins on the socket made it physically impossible to support that many PCIe lanes. If you're using multiple high-end graphics cards, you're still better off with 2011. 

- **Memory**  
Haswell will continue to support dual-channel DDR3 memory. The first time we're expected to see DDR4 on desktop machines will be with Haswell-E. Haswell will natively support overclocked RAM speeds of up to 3200MHz. Why you'd need that kind of speed, I have no goddamn clue.  
&gt;&gt; Haswell will natively support RAM up to 1.5V and 1600Mz

- **SKUs**  
&gt;&gt; There have been a lot of different processor model numbers. In order to simplify the buying process, Intel has decided to move towards only introducing 2 SKUs per level (i3/5/7), and then each with their appropriate modifiers (normal, -K, -R, -S, and -T series).  
There will be no GT0 (without integrated graphics) available on individually sold chips. They will only come on platforms with a dedicated graphics chip built in.

Architecture Changes:

- **On-die VRM**:   
One of the biggest and most significant changes to Haswell architecture from Ivy Bridge is moving the voltage regulation module (VRM) on to the chip itself.  
What does this mean to you? Well, we can only speculate at this point, but you're likely going to see more aggressive overclocking due to the fact that the VRM will be cooled by the CPU's heatsink instead of those smaller ones you see on most high end motherboards. You're also going to be a little safer overclocking, because you won't be at the mercy of shitty manufacturers putting low quality VRMs on your board.

- **Integrated Graphics**  
There are four new levels of integrated graphics available on various Haswell chips. GT1, GT2 (Intel HD), GT3 (Iris), and GT3e (Iris Pro). GT1-3 are ranked in ascending order of power, with the GT3e rumored to be as powerful as an nVidia GT 650M.  
&gt; For Haswell desktop processors, the normal, K, S, and T series will all use GT2 (Intel HD 4600). The R series will be BGA only, and will use the more powerful GT3e (Isis Pro 5200).  
&gt; Intel HD 4xxx and Isis 5xxx will support OpenGL 4.0 and DirectX 11.1

- **eDram**  
eDram is basically a fourth level of cache above L3. Intel claims that it is large enough and fast enough to hold a frame buffer.  This will be available only on the GT3e platform.    
This means you should be getting far better performance while running on integrated graphics. How it will stack up to AMD's A-series is still up in the air, but I don't expect the i series to be able to topple the mighty APU.

- **Unlocked Core Multiplier**  
Your maximum core multiplier has been raised from 56 to 80.  
Unless you're cooling with ln2 (liquid nitrogen), this means nothing to you. What we can expect to see is Intel actually having a chance to surpass AMD's current overclocking record.

- **Unlocked CPU Strap and Higher BCLK tolerance**  
This will allow for higher overclocks for those that like to tweak beyond the core multiplier. Ivy Bridge and Sandy Bridge were very picky about leaving the BLCK alone, and would cause random failures and errors if adjusted. Some early testers have reported stability up to 117MHz!
&gt;&gt; CPU Strap can be set to 1.25x or 1.66x, and BCLK tolerance has been safely tested at +/- 5%. The maximum core multiplier is now 80x instead of 56x.

- **Turbo Mode**  
Turbo mode has changed slightly. The only difference is that switching it off put you permanently at maximum turbo frequency.

- **Idling**  
Previously, Intel CPUs would idle down to 1600MHz. Now they'll go as low as 800MHz, meaning you'll see a lot less power consumption on machines that aren't running 24/7.  
&gt; There is a new ultra-low power idle state that only consumes 0.05W (as opposed to Ivy Bridge's 0.5W). Apparently this has caused some issues with sleep and hibernate with certain power supplies. Motherboard manufacturers have countered this by disabling this ultra-low idle state by default. However, you may need to manually change your setting to the lowest power state allowed by your power supply.  
&gt;&gt; Intel has released a [compatibility list](http://www.intel.com/reseller/psu_selector/) to help you check if you will be able to use your current or future PSU with Haswell.

- **Power Consumption**  
&gt; Haswell desktop chips will come in 3 power consumption flavours. First is the normal and k-series at 84W. Second is the low power S and R series at 65W, and finally the ultra-low power T series at 35-45W.

- **CPU Coolers**  
&gt;&gt; Socket 1155 coolers will fit on socket 1150.

FAQ

- **I'm a first time builder, should I get Ivy Bridge or wait until Haswell?**
That's a tough one that depends on a lot of factors. Here are a few reasons why you'd want to wait for Haswell:  
- If you are an overclocker or want to try overclocking.  
- If you are building a system that will run on integrated graphics.  
- If you need to transfer large amount of data with USB 3.0 on a regular basis.  
If you don't fall into any of these categories, then you could safely pick up an Ivy Bridge chip. If you're patient, there is no harm in waiting for Haswell.

- **Will there be a large performance difference for gamers between Haswell and Ivy Bridge?**  
Early benchmarks seem to indicate that the performance increase is almost negligible. We'll have to wait until the official launch for the final verdict, but I'm not optimistic.

- **What's coming after Haswell?**  
The next series of processors is going to be called Broadwell, and is on Intel's ""tick"" of their development cycle. You'll see a small increase in performance, very similar features, and an increase in power efficiency.

- **What about the BGA rumors?**  
There was a rumor that Intel was going to switch from LGA (land grid array) to BGA (ball grid array), meaning the chips would have to be soldered onto the sockets. This was met with outrage from the building and enthusiast community, and Intel has said there was never plans to take the entire generation BGA. To reiterate, Haswell's socket is LGA 1150. 
&gt; There will be BGA options available, but these will likely only be on ultra-slim, NUC, and other small form factor desktops


- **When can I get my hands on one?**  
The official launch date is June 2nd, 2013. However, there was a small issue with the USB 3.0 controller that causes transfers to halt that requires the computer to be rebooted. Until this is ironed out, Haswell's availability will be highly restricted. If you desperately want one on or near launch day, you may have to line up.  
&gt; Intel has not confirmed if this date will be an actual retail availability launch, or if it will be an ""on paper"" launch for vendors and OEMs.

- **Will Ivy/Sandy Bridge prices drop dramatically with the launch of Haswell?**  
No. You won't ever see deep discounts in processors until they're far beyond obsolete. There is absolutely no reason Intel would give you a reason to buy an older chip.

&gt;&gt; ***New Ivy Bridge-E and Haswell-E Information***

&gt;&gt; - **Socket**  
Ivy Bridge-E and Haswell-E will continue to use Socket 2011. This means that all current X79 boards will be able to be updated to be able to use Ivy Bridge-E chips.

&gt;&gt; - **PCIe**  
Ivy Bridge-E will use the same number of PCIe lanes as Sandy Bridge-E, meaning you still get 16x/16x crossfire. Ivy Bridge-E is now officially PCIe 3.0 certified. Sandy Bridge-E was *technically* capable of PCIe 3.0, but they failed to get that certification before launch.

&gt;&gt; - **SKUs**  
Ivy Bridge-E will come in 3 flavours, and they're all pretty much identical to their Sandy Bridge-E counterparts. There's the 4820K, 4930K, and 4960X. The major difference is that the lowest end Ivy Bridge-E will sport a sexy unlocked multiplier.  
Ivy Bridge-E will also sell in SKUs with and without a stock heatsink.

&gt;&gt; - **Feature changes**  
Ivy Bridge-E will no longer natively support legacy PCI, nor will it have native USB 3.0. However, it will have native SATA 3 without a 3rd party chip.",,False,,t5_2rnve,1369021807.0,,,True,t3_1en16c,http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/1en16c/haswell_and_ivy_bridgee_info_and_faq_two_week/,

i had decided quite some time ago, that i wanted my pc built in my desk drawer. Simply because the idea was fun, and my flat is not that big.
But still didn't want to compromise on performance.
Working from home quite often, so the 'power' is not only for games

I'm proud of this build simply because i've spent some time trying to see what others might have done to build a pc in a drawer, but why never quite right compared to what i wanted

Now please comment, give advices for the next steps...

Still to be done:
* overclocking
* full watercooling integration
* cable management (some challenges here...)

[Here are just a few images](http://imgur.com/a/26rHZ)


**edit:** prices of the 500GB HDD given by pcpartpicker at $526.55! where it is more like $69.99...


**edit 2:**
After all the comments and questions i feel i should add a bit more here.

1/ I have not bought all these in one go. so some choices were already made as i had them. So the total cost is much less than what PCPartPPicker gives. On this note:

* i7: because i had it for a year. I probably would choose another one today
* 3x500GB 2.5"" hdds: because i had 2 from laptops, bought a third one to have raid5 which means more security, more speed (?might have to check this one, as not always true?), more silent and less heat for less volume than a single 3.5"" 7200rpm hdd
* 2 different ssds: because i had them (one from the previous ""version"" of this pc, one from my dead laptop)
* 680GTX: had it before release through a friend (so even had a discount...)
* screen/mouse/keybord... well i wont discuss these ones. i'd say personal choices :)

2/ Temperatures: all fine there. 14cm intake (far bottom right) and 3x12cm out (1 mounted on the W/C radiator)

* CPU: between 35C/95F and 40C/104F
* MB: 32C/89F
* HDD: 40C/104F
* SSD: 30C/86F
* GPU: 37C/98F idle and 75C/167F after some long time on load

Building a small form factor PC

---

Everyone tends to default to ATX when speccing a PC, and there is a somewhat good reason for that. The ATX form factor tends to offer the best bang for buck for high quality/overclocking motherboards and has a wider selection of cases. It also allows for crossfire/SLI with a nice slot spacing between two cards.

However most people could easily downgrade without missing any of the benefits of a larger case. This can also be much more convenient and there are many reasons why you might want to downsize.

I am going to split this guide into a couple of sections by form factor, microATX and miniITX. microATX is more of a half way house which could net you a nicer case for less money.

---

MicroATX

---

The microATX standard was designed to be backwards compatible with the same mounting holes as a regular ATX motherboard. However, it is shorter in length (305mm -&gt; 244mm) so allows cases to be smaller in physical size.

Most microATX motherboards are cheaper than their ATX counterparts in general, however overclocking boards can be pricier.

Features also tend to be conserved - you will not see a huge drop in the featureset by going microATX, although for crossfire/sli the cards will be sandwiched up against each other requiring better airflow to maintain good temperatures.

In terms of power supplies, ATX size is commonly used so you won't need to worry about this as a factor when selecting your PSU.

There are some really nice options for microATX cases such as the Corsair 350D (pricey but has a large featureset despite its average quality), Silverstone TJ08B-E (very high quality and nice clean design), Silverstone FT03B (nice airflow layout) and Fractal Design Arc Mini/Define Mini (other very nice and high quality options)

---

MiniITX

---

This is where you have to be a lot more careful, and are going to get charged a premium for the smaller footprint. Parts must be thought through in a lot more detail than normal however you are going to get a rig which is a heck of a lot smaller.

A common misconception is that a smaller form factor will have less effective cooling, whereas in actual fact the smaller case can act as a wind tunnel channeling air straight over the components allowing for just as much cooling potential.

However you will only have 2 DIMM slots (max 16gb of RAM) and a single PCIe slot due to size restrictions. Overclocking is often also poor, and the only real decent overclocking miniITX motherboard that I am aware of is the Asus P8Z77-I-DELUXE for Ivy/Sandy CPUs.

The good, small cases also often require and SFX form factor PSU. These are much smaller than standard ATX and again come at a premium. There are a few options, but Silverstone makes some of the best including a 450W Gold rated Modular unit which is amazing for the form factor (the ST45SF-G)

You will also need to watch for GPU length to ensure that a long, full sized GPU will fit in the case without any modding.

Good options for cases are the Silverstone SG05-lite, FT03-mini, Fractal Design Node 304 and the Cooler Master Elite 120 Advanced

---

I hope this guide has given you a little to think about, and to consider whether a smaller form factor PC is right for your needs.

Overall the build went reasonably well, though we did run into a few snags - most were of our own doing.


The Swiftech H220 cooler obstructed the first of the RAM slots - which was unfortunate as the motherboard manual states that is one that must be populated even if you run with only two sticks of RAM. We had to ditch the LED Avexir RAM that Ryan had picked out (he likes lots of bling in his builds) as it would not fit with the H220 installed. Instead we used some low profile RAM that conveniently came bundled for free when we were purchasing parts. It's as if Newegg knew we would run into that issue...


We had also originally planned on using a Sapphire Toxic 6GB 7970, but switched out to the GTX 780 right before filming. At the time we originally planned the build, the 780 had not been released yet. This affected our build as we had custom sleeved cables made specifically for the 8-pin/8-pin PCI-E power connectors on the 7970. However, the GTX 780 only used a 6-pin/8-pin PCI-E power connector set, so we were unable to use our attractive sleeved extension for it. Our cable sleever has since sent us a new cable, but it wasn't feasible to get it in time to finish filming.


Overall the Fractal Design R4 is an attractive case, but you can see the amount of flex it exhibits at various points in the video. I wish that it had more space up top for a radiator and fans, as the H220 was completely touching the motherboard VRM heatsinks - something I'm not particularly fond of. 


--


The custom sleeved cables were made by Reddit user Jappetto. If you're interested in having him make some for you, contact him at jappettos.workshop@gmail.com.

-------------------

Some other closing thoughts of my own: 

The H220 was quite difficult to mount on the board.  I believe that this is isolated with AMD motherboards as the intel bracket seemed a bit more intuitive and put together.  The amount of force required to get the block connected to the motherboard was far more than i expected and was somewhat of a hassle.  As Philip mentioned, the fact that the block had hoses on either side also created an unforeseen issue with the ram.  It was literally too close by 1 or 2 millimeters :/  My final complaint regarding the H220 was the rad itself.  The black paint will scratch off extremely easily.  Be very careful when installing it into your build. We have recently become aware of several issues using the bundled memory on AMD boards as well.  Per Crucial, they have confirmed there are compatibility problems and they have been sending users different dimms as replacements.  Speaking of...  Philip just swapped out the Crucial for some of the Samsung wonder ram and now the computer boots just fine.

The Fractal R4 was a nice case to work in, but definitely had some shortcomings.  As we discussed, there was quite a bit of flex at the top of the case which had me worried.  After the rad was installed it was noticeably not flush with the grate.  The alignment of the main body of the case and the front section was also off so far that it was easily noticed with the naked eye.  Hopefully we just got a poorly QC'ed model and this isn't the case on all of them.  I have talked to other R4 owners who did not have these issues.  Everything else with the case went very smoothly.  This was actually my first time working with the quick release style drive bays and they were fantastic.


I hope you enjoy the build and seeing my ugly mug on youtube.  If you have any suggestions for future builds, guides, or facial hair please let me know.

The PC itself is done, but I still plan on doing more aesthetics work making it look nicer and cleaner.

Edit*

Adding info from questions below,

2tb for storage, 128gb ssd for the OS, 256gb ssd for games I currently play. They were all purchased at different times over the span of a few PCs. I do have a 480 gb that I have in my hot swap bay that I use between work and home.

I have 3 1440p panels for my monitors.

And the reason I have 680s and not 780 is because I got the first one back in May 2012 and then the other 2 a few months later the other cards were not even announced yet. Also 3 give me smoother gameplay than 2 because they remove most of the microstudder intorduce when using 2.

I recently posted by new build [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/1bo49t/).  Since then, I have decided to upgrade the case due to poor air flow and temperatures in the TJ07.

For a start, here's a regular tower case [Silverstone FT01](http://i.imgur.com/gSyRSet.jpg).

[Here's my old TJ07](http://i.imgur.com/DGZWBew.jpg) by comparison.

And here is **[the new case](http://i.imgur.com/oJSEKcf.jpg) I selected**.

It is a CaseLabs Magnum TH10, with the [pedestal and 120mm top cover](http://i.imgur.com/cOLEMlF.jpg).

The general idea of the case design is to fit two [NZXT Kraken X60](http://i.imgur.com/XMpVMOU.jpg) 280mm radiator in the bottom pedestal to cool the CPUs.  Because of that, the case is a reverse ATX, and the motherboard is [installed upside down](http://i.imgur.com/Em6oq5W.jpg).

The new case feels much more roomy, and has 44 case fans fitted as follows:

 * [10 Corsair AF140](http://i.imgur.com/QLni50a.jpg) in the bottom pedestal to take air in, and cool the CPU radiator.

 * 7 + 1 Corsair AF120 fans in the bottom to pull air from the pedestal, and push it up in the case.

 * [8 Corsair AF120 fans](http://i.imgur.com/P2czvUi.jpg) inside the [120mm top cover](http://i.imgur.com/N6LL6yj.jpg) to push all the hot air out of the case from the top.

 * 4 Noctua 140mm fans to pull the air for the 2x 280mm CPU radiators

 * 4 AF120 [in the front panel](http://i.imgur.com/Zs05Voy.jpg)

 * [12 fans to cool](http://i.imgur.com/otzeEsQ.jpg) the HDDs and SSDs.

The design of the fans is that each air intake is covered by a dust filter, and where a filter isn't installed, the fan exhaust the air.

Some fans are controlled by a Corsair Link Unit, while others are controlled manually by a [fan controller installed inside the case](http://i.imgur.com/3ZNp8el.jpg).

The [expansion slots](http://i.imgur.com/JVzFLlc.jpg) are configured as follows:

 * 4 slots taken for the 2 GTX Titan GPUs
 * 1 slot for the Asus Xonar STX audio card
 * 2 slots for the LSI host bus adapters
 * 1 slot for a eSATA + USB bracket
 * 1 slot for a FireWire + USB bracket
 * 1 slot for the [Serial Bus port](http://i.imgur.com/b3lT0oC.jpg) (using it to monitor the UPS).

Total of 10 PCI brackets.

The whole computer is powered by a EGVA SuperNova 1500W power supply.

Some other thing to note is that with so many devices requiring a USB header on the motherboard (Power Supply, 2x Krakens, LCD Screen, Corsair Link, front USB ports, PCI brackets), I had to install two [NZXT IU01 USB Expansion](http://i.imgur.com/HHLMEIT.jpg) so that instead of 2 USB headers, I end up with 6 + 4 internal ports.

And yes, the cabling is still a total mess, [especially on the back](http://i.imgur.com/C6roMjT.jpg), since I just don't have the patience to try to put nicely all cables and extension to plug 44 fans and 28 HDDs and SSDs in a tidy manner.

Spending the time to build the computer was all I could afford of computer downtime.

The full specs are as follows:

 * CPU - Dual Xeon E5-2687W - 3.1 GHz - 8-core
 * CPU Cooler - 2x NZXT Kraken X60 with 280mm radiator
 * RAM - 64GB Hynix DDR3 Registered ECC RAM
 * Motherboard - Asus Z9PE-D8 WS
 * Graphics - 2 x 6GB NVIDIA GTX TITAN
 * Case - CaseLabs Magnum TH10 with Pedestal and 120mm top cover
 * Audio - Asus Xonar Essence STX
 * Power Supply - EVGA SuperNova 1500W
 * 2x LSI SAS 9207-8i host bus adapters

Storage:

 * Intel 520 Series SSD (480GB)
 * OCZ Vertex 4 SSD (512 GB)
 * 2x OCZ Vertex 4 SSD (256 GB)
 * OCZ Vertex 2 SSD (256GB)
 * OWC Mercury Extreme SSD (200GB)
 * 4x Samsung 840 Pro (512GB)

= total ~4 TB of SSD storage

 * 7x 4TB Western Digital WD4000FYYZ RE (total 28 TB)
 * 5x 2TB WD Green drives
 * 2x 1TB drives
 * 2x 500GB Hitashi HDD

total of ~41 TB drives

 * Asus BW-12B1ST Blu-Ray Writer

Case accessories:

 * Corsair Link Cooling Kit
 * 2x NZXT IU01 USB Expansion
 * Matrix Orbital BLK204-7T-1U-BK-USB-TCI-E
 * Lamptron FC-9 50W fan controller
 * 3x Icy Dock ToughArmor  4x2.5"" SAS/SATA HDD Hot Swap Mobile Rack (replaced the 40mm fans with Noctua fans)
 * 4x Icy Dock FlexCage Tray-Less 3x3.5"" in 2x5.25"" SATA HDD Cage (replaced the 80mm fan with Noctua fan)
 * Icy Box 5 drive backplane (replaced the two 60mm fans with Noctua fans)

And many many Phobya fan splitters.

The OS I currently run is Windows Server 2012 as a workstation OS, mainly for the ReFS + Storage space feature.

All you need to do is download a Windows 7 trial from [here](http://www.softpedia.com/get/System/OS-Enhancements/Windows-7.shtml). and burn it to a disc or flash drive (assuming you don't already have a copy).

Then [follow these instructions](http://thenextweb.com/microsoft/2012/10/30/microsoft-website-loophole-lets-anyone-buy-windows-8-pro-for-just-15/) (basically telling a fib about when you bought your computer and/or the model).

*Confirmed working* as of a few days ago. People. Just do it. You get a key in your email to use forever. Don't be a cheap ass an try to split $15 on two computers. Just buy another.

I know many people want to stay in budget and are buying parts as they come on sale so if this is confirmed working *pre-build* let us know in comments.

I bought two 6950 2GB's Tuesday night for my new PC, and they're due to arrive on Monday. They each contain a code for Dirt3. Now, I don't give a shit about Dirt3, so when I log onto Newegg out of curiosity today to check if the prices went down on anything I bought, I saw that my exact model of 6950s NOW contain a copy of the new Deus Ex game (I am a HUGE fan of the original game), and I was pissed.

I called Newegg on a whim to see if I could possibly trade in my Dirt3 code for a Deus Ex code. After having trouble understanding me at the beginning, and putting me on hold for about 15 minutes, the guy seemed like he was going to tell me he couldn't do anything for me, but then right as I had to hang up to go to work, he finally told me that because I was a new customer, he was able to MAIL ME two codes for Deus Ex: Human Revolution, for free, and let me keep the two Dirt 3 codes as well.

I am absolutely amazed that this happened. Needless to say I took time to do the phone survey and I will certainly not stop using Newegg in the future. This totally makes up for having to wait until Monday for my parts because they shipped from California.

tl;dr- bought two 6950's with Dirt3 gift; gift changed to Deus Ex right after I bought them; called Newegg and support guy sends me two codes for Deus Ex: Human Revolution for free

With a $1000 buget my questions are:
1) Will this suffice? 
2) Approaching from the position that I am starting with nothing...Am i forgetting anything or have anything that is unnecessary (i.e. Wireless Adapter, Speakers?)

Looking for any and all recommendations from the professionals.  My humble thanks in advance.

**Note**

I bought EVERYTHING from microcenter because I went all the way there just to get the CPU and MOBO (because of a combo deal) so I just picked up everything to kill two birds with one stone. In all it came out to ~$700 (with tax)

------------------------------------------------------------------
**Reasons for what I bought:**

-i5 2500k, because this is a gaming pc (or it will be when I buy a GPU)
and the i5 in my mind is an amazing CPU.

-Hyper 212 plus, because it was cheep and it had good reviews on newegg.

-Gigabyte z68 ud3h, because it was in a combo deal with the i5 (it was only $99 when bought with the i5) and it fulfills my needs

-Corsair vengeance RAM, same reasons as the hyper 212

-WD Caviar blue 500Gb, all I the space I need.

-Corsair 300R, because microcenter was running a deal that made it the same price as the HAF-912, and it has better features than the 912.

-Corsair 600w PSU, It fulfills my needs and inexpensive.

-Lite-On drive, self explanatory.

---------------------------------------------------------------
**My overclocking story (not that interesting):** 

I overclocked the i5 within a few mins of searching and I got it to 4.2Ghz no prob. (and not changing of any settings on the mobo) but then I tried for 4.5 and I blue screened, so I put it back to 4.2 because I didn't want to bother with adjusting anything.

---------------------------------------------------------------
**Thanks and extra stuff**

First of I want to thank [Valkyr](http://www.reddit.com/user/valkyr) because he helped me with my [original post](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/q35hn/build_ready_620_budget_gaming_pc_buying_parts/), Even though I change mostly everything in the build from what Valkyr posted in the comments of my post, I am still thanking him for the help he gave me.

1347557552.0,177,self.buildapc,zty9e,[Announcement] Clarification regarding our submission guidelines,198,21,39,http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/zty9e/announcement_clarification_regarding_our/,"Recently it seems as though our community has taken a slight change in direction.  We have seen much more content being submitted for a quick karma grab than for the betterment of the sub as a whole.  While these posts will often lead to great discussions in the comments, we would like to clarify what can and should be posted as well as the correct method of doing so.

First, a quick reminder.  All [Build Help], [Build Read], [Troubleshooting] and [Build Complete] posts should be done as a text submission.  There are no exceptions.  If you see them as a link submission please report them to the mods so we can remove them and inform the poster that it needs to be resubmitted.

Next, please check and see if there might be a better subreddit for you to post to.  Have an awesome picture of your whole setup?  Try /r/Battlestations.  Got great cables?  Check out /r/CableManagement.  Generally speaking, submissions that focus almost entirely on pictures should be limited to [Build Complete].  That being said, if you do have an awesome picture or story you would like to tell feel free to submit it as a text submission.  The more details you provide, the more the community can learn and discuss together.

This bring me to my final point.  Our sub is a congregation of tens of thousands of minds with one simple goal - build computers, teach others, and maybe learn something ourselves.  If you see a [Build Help] post with little to no information and the person sounds like they are new to building, PLEASE direct them to the sidebar or offer your advice.

Please note we will also be tossing in a stylesheet update and a rework of the sidebar as well as the create a submission screen as well.  This will go live within the coming weeks ahead.  Additionally, we highly encourage link submissions for information the community can benefit from such as product releases, benchmarks, or tutorials.

Thanks for taking the time to read this post and feel free to leave any comments positive or negative on this post.  The moderating team is always looking for any feedback we can get from the community.

My own opinion, there are two ways to approach this and the ""break"" for which way to go is budget based.

First, I should say that personally I don't believe, given the pace of change in the tech industry, that you can really ""future proof"" a system. Even the x79/LGA2011 route is going to break down next year (DDR4 support will force chipset change at minimum).

- Approach #1 - Go big or go home.  Basically you build the best rig you can afford and ride it out until either the software platform (Windows, Games, etc) make it no longer acceptable or the hardware platform (let's use DDR4 as an example) require a change. You can still upgrade components with this approach, but usually that's changing to a new GPU or adding more memory, things of that nature.

- Approach #2 - Build for upgrade. Here you build a system with the objetive of changing components over time. You start out with a cheaper CPU, lower end GPU, less system RAM, etc. and plan to upgrade pieces to keep the system ""usable"".  This requires a smaller budget up-front and some intelligent research to make sure you buy components that allow for upgrade/expansion.

In my experience, neither approach is ""better"", it's almost all driven by budget. If you have $1000+ to spend on Approach #1, you can build a system that you're happy with and works for a few years without needing any attention. (Obviously you Can upgrade, but you might not Need an upgrade).  

On the other hand, if you can only blow $750, Approach #2 may be your best bet, with the intention of saving up for that kick-ass GPU in 3 months (or whatever).

Your comments, thoughts, opinions and suggestions are welcome.

EDITS/UPDATES:

Great discussion everyone, that's exactly what I was hoping for when I created this post. Please keep sharing your thoughts and opinions. My goal is to come back and try to ""sum"" up the discussion for any future readers.

Obviously everyone has their own opinion, but if I were to summarize the commentary:

**1. Approach #1 seems to be generally preferred vs Approach #2**
 
**2. Budget plays a strong factor in the decision. If you want a really nice system but only have $500, you might consider waiting a few months and saving up more money so you can buy further up the performance range**

**3. As for Approach #2, GPU upgrading seems to be the most popular option to plan for**

I think the discussion has pretty much run it's course. Thanks to everyone that joined in and shared their opinion!

**The Concept**

The concept was simple - I wanted a gaming/all in one PC that would play whatever I threw at it at High/Ultra settings, that would run fast, cool and quiet.  Mission accomplished.  The above price in pcpartpicker isnt the actual price I paid, which was closer to $1200.00 after sales.

**Component Selection**

I went with the **Corsair 550D** mainly because I wanted something quiet with sound deadening materials that also looked great.  I'm not into a lot of flash when it comes to cases.  The Fractal R4, which is what I really wanted, wasnt on sale, and I got the Corsair 550D for a great price.  The case is high quality case and I'm quite happy with it.  Its extremely quiet as well.  I barely hear it at idle and when fans start to spool up its still extremely quiet and you cant hear it over speakers or headphones.  Building in it was wonderful.  MB risers were pre installed, and drives snapped into place without needing screws.  It had plenty of wire pass throughs as well.  In the future i'll probably add some silent case fans to replace the fans that came stock with it to try to bring the decibel levels down further.

I chose the **Gigabyte Radeon 7950** as the 7870XT wasnt available anywhere, and I read some great reviews on the Gigabyte model with 3 fan cooling setup.  Again, the 7870XT was more my budget, but The Sapphire model I wanted was sold out everywhere for weeks, so I decided to take a step up instead of a step down.  The reviews also noted how quiet the card is, and I have to agree.  Its very quiet.  3 Fans=better cooling=slower fan speed to keep cool=quiet operation.  So far I've only been playing Bioshock Infinite on it and it runs at Ultra settings with no hiccups or problems.  

I also went with an **SSD**, the Samsung 840.  Boot times are sub 8 seconds and everything snaps open.  Load times in Bioshock are negligible.  If you can afford one, get it, it makes a world of difference.

I went with the **Gigabyte GA-Z77X-UD3H** due to the great reviews and I've read its a solid motherboard and a good overclocker. Honestly, I didnt have that much budgeted towards my motherboard and wanted to go with a Biostar TZ77XE3 board or the Asrock Extreme 4.  I wanted a MB with an spdif out on it to use my Turtle Beach X41 headphones for surround gaming, so that elminated the Biostar.  For whatever reason the Extreme 4 went off sale price when I went to order at all vendors and I decided to go with the Gigabyte instead if I was going to be paying that much money.

The **3570K** and **Coolermaster 212 EVO** were picked for gaming and to allow overclocking should I want to fool around with it.  the **RAM** wasnt something I did a lot of research on, I just wanted something without huge heatsinks, with 9 CAS and 1600mhz.

As far as the **XFX PSU**, I simply wanted a quality PSU that wouldnt break the bank, and this fell nicely into those restrictions.

I went back and forth on the **Dell U2312HM**.  I was using a 20"" LCD Dell 2001FP from 2003 (16ms response time) and my original plan was to keep it and continue using it.  But the more I thought to myself, if i'm building a new PC, that I plan to game on, not spending an extra couple hundred on a quality monitor seemed silly.  I knew instantly I wanted an IPS panel.  I know what you're thinking - gaming?  Should've gone with a non-ips panel.  Well, I can tell you that the U2312HM has been great to game on so far.    I havent seen any ghosting with it or any lag, at least none to my eyes.  [See the TFTCentral Review](http://www.tftcentral.co.uk/reviews/dell_u2312hm.htm)  When I first turned it on and booted into windows I knew instantly an IPS panel was the right choice.  The difference between by old monitor and new was significant.  Colors really pop on this thing and my first entry into Columbia on Bioshock allowed the monitor to really show off.  I dont mind the anti glare coating on it either, as I was used to it on my old dell monitor.  If you guys are using a really old monitor and dont have a new monitor figured into the cost of your new build, I recommend you do so. I got this dell on sale for about $190.00.

Idling temperatures of all 4 cores are sitting at low 30s (fluctuating 29-32c)

Room temp is 72.

After 25 minutes of prime95 in blend mode:
Core 0: min 30 max 55

Core 1: min 31 max 61

Core 2: min 21 max 55

Core 3: min 27 max 56

It looks as though I'm seeing core 0, 2, and 3 running about 51-54 and core 1 running 58-59.



Well, thats it guys.  If you have any questions, let me know!

Run Silent, Run Deep.

Second, compusa automatically packaged a ""free antivirus subscription"" with my order.

Of course, when it automatically renews they will gladly charge your credit card.

I would seriously recommend everyone to never buy from compusa under any circumstances. Thank you, that is all.

This is the first PC that I built all by myself and replaces a 4 year old E6750 system.

* Total was a cool $800. Everything in the PC was bought new for this build except for a 60 GB SSD that I was gifted a while back. My advice for upcoming builders: pick out a tentative system configuration a month or two before your planned build, and then track Newegg/Slickdeals for deals on related parts. If you're not in a hurry to build a new PC right this second, you'll come across tons of great pertinent deals. 

* Here's some [photos!](http://protocolsnow.imgur.com/1V0O9)
This is the first PC I've spent time on cable management. There's room for improvement but I'm happy with this attempt.
I also realize I need a bigger desk. I have a dust problem in my apartment so I'm being nice to my PC and putting it on my desk for now.

* System config is a very typical P8P67, i5 2500k, 8 GB RAM, GTX 460, Spinpoint F3, 60 GB SSD, packed into a Fractal Define R3 case. I was aiming for the ""sweet spot"" in price/performance. I don't know how to make a table in reddit, but the specific parts and a brief writeup of my experience are [here](http://www.protocolsnow.com/2011/04/03/2011-new-pc-build/) if interested.

I'm coming from a netbook. It has a 1.6Ghz Single Core Atom Processor, 2GB's of RAM. I couldn't even open Chrome. Now I can do just about anything. I wanted to beat a Mac Mini for price and performance and be able to get into PC Gaming. This little rig does all that. The only problem is heat, which I had anticipated. I've got two 40mm fans in the case, but it still gets a bit too hot for my tastes with the top on. I think I'm going to just drill some holes in the top in a nice pattern.

All I ever see in in posts regarding internet connections (for my build and others) is every time someone posts a high end build or asks for tech support in another subreddit there is almost always a response like ""everything looks great except the use of WiFi"" or ""why would you use WiFi on a build like this"".  My question is how fast does an ISP have to be in order for a wired connection to have a significant advantage? From what I have read most people in the USA live in places with few choices for ISPs and are often limited to slow DSL connections and until Google fiber becomes more common the faster connections are usually very expensive if available at all. 

-In my case, and for several others I have read about, wired connections would be very difficult. In my case the router has to be in the kitchen to have access to a phone line in a central location (there are devices both upstairs and downstairs from there). There is no good place to put a computer in the kitchen so all devices use WiFi. If I wanted to use a wired connection I would have to use a 75-100 foot Ethernet cable for each device and string them across busy areas. This seems to be a common problem, especially since so many redditors live in apartments, dorms, or with parents, none of which take kindly to drilling holes in the walls or setting up tripping hazard cables. 

-I have century link and get 12 Mbps down and 5 Mbps up and don't feel like I'm missing much by using WiFi, century link has terrible latency either way. I know if I got Google fiber in my area I would want to use a wired connection because my WiFi would become the bottleneck but what about connection speeds in between? It would be nice to have some kind of consensus as to what kind of connections are best in different situations similar to how using 16 GB of RAM is overkill for gaming or a titan is overkill for a low resolution monitor. 

* **tl/dr** of course wired is better but how much would someone with a crappy ISP gain from using wired over WiFi?

##Water Cooling Guide


##Introduction
The purpose of this guide is to give readers the basic knowledge required to select, build and maintain components in a custom water loop. It is not a technical outline of the hardware involved, but rather a simple overview to give the reader background information on what custom loops are, how they are assembled and how to maintain them. This guide is not, and will never be, 100% complete.  As technology continues to advance, new solutions for old problems will arise, new problems with new solutions will need to be addressed, and this guide will slowly become outdated.

With that said, I hope you enjoy the information contained within and I hope you gain a deeper understanding in the technology and process behind custom water cooled computers.

##Purpose of Liquid Cooling In General

*Just a little preface before you start reading: I will be referring to “Water Cooling” as both “water cooling” and “liquid cooling.” I like to use “liquid cooling” for general ‘cooling with a liquid’ and not necessarily PC related, and “water cooling” to refer specifically to cooling PC components with liquid. I realize that you don’t **have** to use water as the liquid in your loop (and I even get into that in later sections) but it makes it easy to refer to one or another.*

A very important part of any process is figuring out why you're doing it in the first place. Lots of people are going to read this and ask “Why the hell do you need to go through all this trouble when a good air sink would be just as effective?” Liquid Cooling something is far more difficult, complicated and rewarding than just slapping a big heatsink on it and calling it a day, and it’s therefore important to understand the process and theory behind it.

The purpose of Liquid Cooling varies from implementation to implementation. Speaking generally, the advantages of Liquid Cooling are as follows:

- Relocated or reduced noise and heat. The ability to move heat exchanger to other locations is pivotal in some implementations. Most cars, for example, would look pretty funny if they all had air cooled engines instead of a liquid solution. Some machines use radiators to move the noise of fans to a different locations.
- More heat capacity. Most Liquid simply has the ability to hold much more heat than metal, and therefore takes much more energy to heat.
- Efficiency. Liquid radiators are more efficient at transferring heat to the air compared to conventional air sink fins.
- Size. Water blocks are almost always significantly smaller in physical size compared to air sinks. This can allow for very thin and small hardware implementations while still being able to dissipate heat effectively.
- It looks pretty damn cool. This one is mostly for computers, but I think we can all agree that a good water loop looks really freakin’ cool!

In addition to those advantages, Liquid Cooling also comes with a set of disadvantages:

- It's complicated! As mentioned in the first paragraph, compared to air cooling, Liquid Cooling is significantly more complicated and time consuming. There are many more nuances and little gotchas that you have to look out for and work around.
- It's expensive! Any Liquid solution is going to be significantly more expensive than a comparable air solution. This mainly because there are many more separate components in a Liquid loop compared to an air sink.
- Maintenance. A water loop requires much more maintenance compared to an air sink. This requires time and patience.
- Water spills. I saved this one for the end for a reason. If you can follow directions and not do anything stupid, water spills are essentially a non-issue. The first thing people think of when they think about a water loop is “What if I spill water on my expensive computer?” I'll get more into this in later sections, but proper water loops will have an extremely small chance of damaging something, even if there are spills or leaks.

Depending on how you want to assemble your loop, you may take advantage of some or all of the advantages and will be burdened by most, if not all, of the disadvantages.

***Please note: Before you go any farther, let me just say that water cooling a PC is not for everyone! It’s for people who either need to use one of the above advantages or for people who have researched it and found their own reasons. I highly recommend that you, at the very least, read ENTIRELY through this guide before starting this project. Ideally, you should do even more research past the information contained in this guide.***

***I, nor r/BuildaPC, will be responsible for ruined hardware or broken egos resulting from the misuse of this document. This is simply a guide, it’s meant to aid in the first step of this process: research. Nothing more.***

##Overview of Water Cooling Components
To start off the main part of the guide, I’ll give you a quick rundown of the various components involved in a PC water loop and the measurements and statistics used to determine performance. I will try to be as detailed as possible, but I may miss a few points here and there.

##Water blocks
Water blocks are used to transfer heat from the source into the water. They are essentially heat exchangers that move heat energy to the water from the heat generating component.

Water blocks rely on surface area and flow rate to transfer heat quickly and effectively. Just like air sinks, the more surface area there is, the more heat can be transferred.

To add surface area, water block manufacturers rely on fins, pins and channels. Depending on the design, a water block will make use of any one of those 3 concepts. There is no single best solution for a good water block, so don’t ask about one. Your best bet is to look at reviews and other data.

The restriction of the block is often a metric used to compare blocks. This is a measurement of how much water can be pumped through the block in a given amount of time. High restriction blocks often perform better with a more powerful pump and a loop of it’s own. Low restriction blocks may sacrifice performance, but they also allow you to chain more blocks together.

This is a minor concern in reality, but it’s worth noting.

###CPU Blocks
CPU water blocks are the most common type of block, by far. Often made of copper and coated with nickel for a shiny silver finish.

CPU blocks make use of pins and fins mostly. Some CPU blocks are designed with channels, but there aren’t many out there.

They attach to your motherboard just like any other aftermarket heatsink, with a backplate and other mounting hardware.

###GPU Blocks
GPU blocks are designed to fit on your graphics card. There are 2 main types of GPU blocks:
Full cover GPU blocks are designed to (as the name suggests) fully cover the GPU PCB. Blocks of this type often support a single card and PCB design. They cool the GPU core, memory and power delivery (VRMs) with a single block.
Universal GPU blocks are often designed to fit on any GPU. They may include brackets for many different types of mounting scenarios, just like CPU blocks. Even though most GPUs today use standard mounting holes and specifications, universal GPU blocks (despite the name) are not always universal.
Because universal blocks only cool the GPU itself, you will often need separate cooling on the power delivery (VRMs) and memory. This often comes in the form of stick on heatsinks.
###Chipset and Other Blocks
In addition to cooling your GPU and CPU, some people like to attach water blocks to additional heat-generating components in their PC.

Chipset blocks are similar to GPU blocks. They come in universal and board-specific versions. Board-specific blocks are almost always limited to a single motherboard version. Board-specific blocks are very rare, even for expensive and popular motherboards.

Other places people have put water blocks are:
RAM. Most RAM blocks are custom designed and rather expensive. Nowadays, RAM doesn’t really generate enough heat to warrant a fully custom solution.
Hard Drives. Yes, there have been water blocks designed to fit around hard drives. No, they aren’t really necessary.
PSUs. There have been a few PSUs that have connections for water loops. Again, this isn’t really necessary and it’s very expensive.

##Pumps
Pumps are responsible for circulating water around your loop. They often vary in physical design and size, power consumption and noise generation.

###Pump Measurement Figures Explained
Pumps are categorized and measured with, in addition to dB for noise and watts for power consumption, head pressure and flow rate.

Flow rate is the measurement of how much liquid a pump can move with no restriction. Usually measured in gallons/liters per hour, flow rate doesn’t tell you much unless you also know the head pressure, because no water loop is going to have 0 restriction.

Head pressure is how hard or high a pump can push liquid at full load (with 0 flow or 100% restriction). It’s measured by seeing how high a pump can push water through a thin tube and is usually measured in feet or meters.

A pump with lots of flow is useless if it can’t push that water through minor restrictions. Similarly, a pump with lots of head pressure and not a lot of flow isn’t very useful either.

###Common Pump Designs and Implementations

The most common pump today is a variation on a single design, the Laing DDC pump. The pump only has a single moving part and is very reliable. It’s essentially a large magnet with an impeller attached to it in the middle that gets moved by electromagnets around the perimeter of the pump.

Because of it’s reliability and effectiveness, lots of companies have taken the design and changed minor details, like the top housing geometry for more flow or head pressure.

Chances are, unless you are looking for an extremely powerful pump, your best (and cheapest) bet is a DDC pump from any one of the known component manufacturers.

Other pumps have more powerful motors or other features that can’t fit inside the DDC form factor, but often require more maintenance and care.

##Radiators and Heat Exchangers
Radiators and heat exchangers are technically the same thing (a radiator is a heat exchanger). They are designed to transfer heat from one substance to another efficiently. However, the term “radiator” usually refers to a liquid-air heat exchanger.

Simply put, the point of a radiator in a custom loop is to get heat out of the liquid and into the air so it can go pick up more heat from the components.

###Radiator Measurement Figures Explained
Water cooling radiators come in all shapes, sizes, thicknesses and fin densities.

Unless you want a passive radiator or non-water cooling radiator (like a heater core from a car, which is not really recommended), the one you select will be based around a fan size.

Therefore, most common fan size also gets the most base common radiator size, 120mm. In addition to single 120mm radiators, you also have doubles, triples and even quads. Some companies even make radiators meant to hold 9 120mm fans in a big square! Of course, just because 120mm fans are the most common doesn’t mean that they are the only fans around, you can find radiators that take any size fan you want.

Additionally, some radiators are thicker than others. This, combined with fin density, determines what the ideal type of fan you want to use on the radiator is. Thickness is measured in mm and comes in all sorts of measurements, the thickest I’ve seen being 80mm and about 20mm for the thinnest. Fin density is measured in FPI or Fins Per Inch. 30 FPI is on the high side while 5-10 is low.

Thicker and denser radiators ideally need fans with high static pressure to push air through the fins. Thinner radiators with less fin density perform better with fans that have lots of airflow.

###Common Radiators and Designs
In addition to shape, size, thickness and fin density, some radiators have other features that are worth mentioning.

Some radiators are “Crossflow” radiators, which means that it has an inlet on one end of the radiator and another on the other end (while regular radiators have both on the same side). These are very helpful for some loop setups and not great for others. What you decide to buy all depends on how you want to set up your loop.

Some radiators also have different fin materials and paint. These can affect performance and other thermal characteristics, but the effect is largely aesthetic.

###Shrouds
Some people (although I haven’t seen many people doing it anymore) like to put shrouds between their fans and radiators. A shroud, usually made of plastic, is meant to mitigate the “dead zone” of no air that a fan mounted directly to the radiator has. It simply separates the fan and radiator by about an inch to reduce the size of the zone.

You can go with or without shrouds, it makes a relatively small difference. Sometimes, people mount them for aesthetic reasons.",,False,,t5_2rnve,1361333252.0,,,True,t3_18uxax,http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/18uxax/guide_another_custom_loop_guide_enjoy_buildapc/,

Finally had enough time to make this. I've been wanting to make a new build with the Corsair 600t for a long while.


To start off, this machine is a dual booting machine. It boots OS X and Windows 7 Ultimate. I use OS X for productivity work (i.e. writing, photoshop, finalcutpro) and Windows for gaming. The Machine is overclocked to 4.8GHz at the moment and I'm probably planning to go higher once my AS5 TIM cures. My current idle is at 35c with an ambient room temp of 24. The SP120 fans are connected to the Corsair 600t's fan control. As of now, I keep it at the lowest setting so the temperatures can be better if I decide to bare with the sound of the fans.



For OS X, I used the Intel 520 SSD along with one of the Seagate HDD to make 1 logical drive using Apple's Fusion Drive moniker. It combines the 120GB SSD storage with the 1TB Seagate to make the total sum 1.12TB. I've got to say it works well and now I am enjoying speeds of an SSD without worrying about how much space I have left. All my media files I use within FCPx gets read real fast and this has been a cinch to use.


For Windows, it was just a straight forward install. The OS and programs go to the Intel 330 SSD and I use the 1TB drive as a steamdrive. 


And finally for my monitor choice, I really wanted to stay with IPS panels since all I've used in the past 6 years are MacBooks and iPhones so I decided to get the HP2311xi.

1369941547.0,168,self.buildapc,1fcs77,[Discussion] RAM: Single vs Dual Channel speed benchmarks (1x8GB vs 2x8GB),217,49,87,http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/1fcs77/discussion_ram_single_vs_dual_channel_speed/,"**TL;DR at the bottom**

Hi /r/buildapc , I wanted to know if there really was any difference between running RAM in single channel vs dual channel. As there were no modern non-artificial benchmarks around, I decided to do it myself. 

As it stands right now, the common consensus for single vs dual channel is

2xRAM Advantage:

* the ""if one fails you can at least have a working computer while the dead stick gets an RMA"" argument  
* is slightly faster  

1xRAM advantage:

* more space for upgrades (especially useful if you have only two slots for RAM on your motherboard)
* usually cheaper  

8GB of RAM is considered ""more than sufficient"". So running 1 x 8GB should not result in anything written to the paging file (loss of performance from something other than single vs dual channel). I would have liked to perform the 2 x 4GB test, but I don't have that kit with me.  **My testing methodology may not be the best (this is my first time benchmarking), but I hope to accurately capture any differences between the two. PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF ANYTHING CAN BE IMPROVED OR DONE BETTER** I have only tested 2 games and 2 ""productivity"" tests. 

All tests were run with the XMP profile enabled in the BIOs (1.5v, 1600MHz, 9-9-9-24), my system specs are as follows, I left the CPU at stock for the test:

FINAL CONCLUSION OR TL;DR:

Have I proven that there is no difference between single vs dual channel RAM? No, I have not. However, I probably have proven that **in (most? I can't count 2 games as most can I?) games, video and audio encoding, there is zero (negligible? near zero?) performance gain to be had in faster RAM.**

**DRAW YOUR OWN CONCLUSIONS.**

I might be compelled to do a further study if I feel like doing so. If you have any requests for me to test please let me know in the comments below, I may test them and post them in a new thread. For games, please only request from [my Steam library](http://i.minus.com/iAz2W90XqHTQa.png), Starcraft 2 WoL, or any other free games that can be downloaded easily. For ""productivity"", please also only request from free applications. **PLEASE DO NOT REQUEST SYNTHETIC BENCHMARKS**

EDIT:

Unfortunately I don't have much cash, so my plan is to get an old case from a thrift store, gut it, and put in my own mobo and an i5 3570K chip so I can use the integrated graphics until I buy a graphics card down the line.

Since I'd like to get a MicroATX mobo for the form factor, I was thinking of the Asus Maximum V Gene, which seems to be well-reviewed. But what exactly does it offer that, say, the Asus P8B75 doesn't offer? Eventually I'd like to get a better case, power supply, and all that I need to make a proper good gaming computer. Will I regret buying a cheaper mobo this time next year when I'm upgrading my system?

It's really annoying to see the ""drive-by"" fanboying go on. I know that for a lot of us, it's kind of funny, or it might not seem like a big deal, but I believe it's truly detrimental for people who genuinely aren't knowledgeable about computer parts when they open a thread and see a bunch of possible misinformation going around.

I'm not trying to name names or call anyone out in particular, as I believe most people have been guilty of it at one point in time (I'll definitely admit to it), but it's incredibly frustrating to be arguing in a thread with someone who won't source any of their opinions. Again, it's not just for ""quality of life"" reasons, but more-so because I feel that people who are inexperienced with parts could be mislead by reading certain threads.

I'm sure quite a few of us had a good laugh at [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/1dw2ms/build_complete_nice_computer_bad_cable_management/) thread because the poor sap obviously wasted quite a bit of money. I thought it was fairly funny, but then [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/1dw2ms/build_complete_nice_computer_bad_cable_management/c9ug2s6) comment in particular stood out to me:

&gt;Power Supply: Someone told me that running a power supply at about 50% load maximizes it's efficiency.

Even though this isn't necessarily true (and definitely isn't something you should encourage people to do - buying a PSU that's 2x as much as the **maximum draw** on their system), I've personally seen people recite ""facts"" like these without giving any sort of explanation or documentation of their claims.

Did this one particular guy get completely fucked out of a decent system because he was unlucky and stumbled into the wrong threads?

I know that it's on the customer to do more research, but that doesn't mean that we shouldn't do our best to try to stem the tides of misinformation out there, either. It's hard to look at it from a newbie's perspective because most of us are able to go into a thread and readily pick out the bullshit since we have experience in selecting and building parts. That being said, a lot of (see: **most**) new consumers probably couldn't tell you the difference between a 7970 and an 8800GTX. Or what the difference is between an SSD or an HDD. Or what all those blasted numbers mean behind a processor (a 3320 intel chip is way better than a 2700k because the number is bigger! a gtx 630 is obviously better than a gtx 580, etc...etc...).

The only possible cons I could see to requiring a source for a certain claim (ie: no, a 7970 IS better than a 670, or Intel objectively dominates the top of the CPU market, or an i5 will be just as good in a gaming box as an i7, etc...etc...) is that it might discourage some people from posting, but if those people are too hesitant to find benchmarks, or are even unaware of their existence, are they people you'd want giving advice anyway?",,False,,t5_2rnve,False,,,True,t3_1e08jv,http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/1e08jv/requiring_sources_for_claims/,

(it's perfect),213,46,124,http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/1iwk9r/build_complete_its_a_computer_and_it_loads/,"For that last year or so, I have been gaming on my laptop, which, I should add doesn't even have a graphics card. After many months of looking at reviews, builds, and forums I have finally taken the plunge and built my own PC. 

**Build Day**

The build itself was relatively painless; the hardest part was installing the cpu cooler without removing the motherboard (I initially could not find the included thermal paste so I used the stock cooler because i didn't want to wait for shipping.) Getting the audio header to fit was also a struggle, but I was victorious (eventually).


**Overclocking**

Because I had to wait for the windows 7 disc (I got it from my university) I settled with vista, which the motherboard drivers weren't compatible with. I baisically used the waiting time to overclock. At 1.2v vcore, I could only load windows at 4.4 GHz and lower, any higher setting wouldn't load. I didn't like the temps I was getting at that setting though (it was consistently higher than 70C under load) so instead I set the multiplier at 42 and I worked up voltages from 1.16v vcore until I found a stable setting (4.2GHz @ 1.18v vcore). this was my first time overclocking so i was nervous but I am happy with the results I got (temps at about 63C under load, they can spike higher but that is rare).

**Problems and Issues**

The RAM was a bit weird, I got it from ebay and the low voltage aspect wasn't clearly marked. Once i set the voltage to 1.25v in bios, everything seemed to work a lot better.

I started saving for this build last fall, mostly because spending over a grand at once really seemed irresponsible. The main points are the i5-4670k, the GTX 760, and of course, the lighting. The i5 only gets to 4.2ghz at 1.2 volts, but I'm ok with that, I don't really need it to be insanely fast. All the fans are at 5v using the case's fan controller, and it's mostly quiet. Saving up over such a long period of time got me some great deals, like the storage, OS, and power supply (which may be overkill, but the fan never needs to turn on and it's got a 7-year warranty, will probably last forever). In a few months I'll be adding a second 760 and a third monitor, so that will be fun :)

I'm super happy with how this build turned out, and although I never submitted a [Build Help/Ready], I couldn't have done it without absorbing so much of the knowledge thrown back and forth on /r/buildapc. Thanks guys!

Warning: emotions below.

*In the weeks leading up to finalizing this build, I wanted to come up with a [naming scheme](http://namingschemes.com/) for my personal builds. I've built a half dozen machines in the last few years, but this is really the first one that's my personal, meant-for-gaming machine. I chose the last names of the members of the team at the video game website [Giant Bomb](http://giantbomb.com/), as they all have pretty interesting last names (Gerstmann, Caravella, Shoemaker, Scanlon, Snider, etc.). I was originally going to name it after Patrick Klepek, as he recently left the Giant Bomb podcast in the process of moving to Chicago.*

*Unfortunately, on the same day as the arrival of my GPU, the final part, [we learned of the death of the recently-wed Ryan Davis](http://www.giantbomb.com/articles/ryan-davis-1979-2013/1100-4685/). It's a really odd feeling when someone you care about, yet know of only through the internet, passes away. I never realized how much I really cared for him until he was gone, and honestly it still feels like I'm about to wake up for a bad dream. In the last several years of my life, listening to Ryan and his colleagues on the bombcast has had a huge impact on my sense of humor and taste in video games. Although I've never met the man, I'm glad to have been able to watch and listen to him for most of my adult life.*

We decided to do a Mini-ITX build for lulz and convenience.  To fit the PSU in, we ghetto-bent a portion of the case and drilled three holes.  We didn't have a rotary tool/dremel at hand, though making a simple cut (rather than that awful bend) would have been preferred.  To drill those three holes in a really ghetto way, we took a piece of paper and placed it flush against the back-side of the PSU (after cutting holes in it to let the power socket and switch through).  Then, we used a pencil to poke holes through that mask.

The components did fit closer than we expected, though we did measure things out beforehand.  The cable management ended better than I thought, and we somehow got a clear channel for air to flow through the chassis.  Ultimately, we overclocked the rig to 4.5 GHz stable (I think we could have easily reached 4.6 without hitting TJ Max), though we pushed it down to 4.4 to lower temperatures to a more friendly range.

Lessons Learned:  

* Mini-ITX builds are do-able by average people.  This was the second build I had done in a year, and I was extremely happy about it.
* Compactness doesn't necessarily mean really high temps.  If I recall correctly, with his OC at 4.4 GHz, we were reaching 7x*C on artificial loads with an h60 without amazing ventilation.  In all honesty, I think he got a really good 4670k.
* While three screws _should_ have in theory forced the PSU to align to the chassis in right angles (you can see a slight bend, which scares me), that didn't really happen in reality.  We didn't take any pictures of it, though we solved this issue by routing cabling under the psu, which actually pushed it up.  I feel this is a temporary hack, and we're probably going to add some reinforcing piece of metal that would push up on the PSU and be secured by a side-panel hole.  

Additional Notes:  
  
* The Realtek audio drivers caused hard resets (without BSOD!).  Event viewer showed kernel power failure events, which was misleading.  Simply installing newer drivers fixed that issue.
* The lack of an ODD was a choice we picked early on.  We left SATA3 power and data connectors on the side (between the GPU and the PSU) and used them to install windows with an ODD ripped out of my desktop.
* I honestly think the RAM should have been dropped down to 8GB.  We ultimately stuck with 16GB as a ""just in case"" sort of thing.

Final notes:  

We had a lot of fun! My friend was really hesitant about touching components at first, but I pretty much forced him to do a lot of the things, and he ended up liking it in the end.  We probably could have saved $200 waiting for better sales, but in the end, it was fun and that made it worth it.

I'm getting all my parts from Memory Express here in Canada so I don't have to spend money on shipping. But basically, I am a really old man with nothing much left to do, until my grandson told me to try building a desktop. I have a lot of money but ever since my wife passed away, I have been wasting away, just waiting for the time until I meet her again. I am 71 years old and have absolutely no knowledge with computers, let alone building one, but I am very eager to learn! My grandson showed me the YouTube video to the side explaining how to build it and it seemed fairly easy to do (at least, the man made it seem easy - hopefully I'll find it easy as well). I learned how to use the Internet (I have all the time in the world) and I'm very determined to learn this one as well.

Also, please ""ELI5"" it for me. My mind's not as sharp as it used to be.

**[Edit]** I am very sorry everyone. I am getting pretty tired. I think I'm going to head to bed for now. I've been trying to reply to every single post but it's hard to keep up. I have learned many things! I guess I thought since I can't build him a car, I might as well build him a desktop that he can use when he gets a bit older (my grandson). I guess desktops do not last as long as cars do. I'll try buildapcforme and hope that they can help me out with a more reasonable build.

I feel like this isn't even close to the goal of the subreddit, and it's a little harmful to BaPC to actually answer these threads, because it strays a little from what I perceive as the ""goal"" of the subreddit.

As far as I'm concerned I think this subreddit is about advice on a build and not about suggesting a full build. It's Build a PC after all, not Suggest a PC Build. What bothers me about these posts is that people are going to learn how to build a PC in the strictest sense, but aren't going to learn a single thing about what you need to account for when you're planning a build. Kind of a give a man a fish, teach a man to fish scenario, where they'll come back when they need another PC and ask the exact same question again.

Maybe posters should avoid the build spoon-feeding and suggest what a minority of people do, namely telling the OP to do his research before asking for criticism. I feel that athough it may sound a little harsh at times, people can understand that we have their best interest in mind when we tell them to educate themselves on what they're buying. I realise this isn't something that the mods can ""enforce"", but maybe regulars can help stopping this.

TL;DR : Stop spoon-feeding, make people do research instead. What do you think?

So, I want to preface this by saying that I'm actually fairly comfortable with what goes on in this sub. A year or two ago I built my own high-end gaming computer for about $2800, but then I tragically went unemployed about 6 months later and had to sell it.

Since then, for the past year, I've been playing League of Legends on my 2009 Macbook Pro at all low settings, even dropping the game resolution to make it more playable. I can barely scrape 25 fps if I'm lucky, and if I even try to open Skype, my computer has a heart attack.

I'm looking to get a PC with my $600 tax refund check, to play League with. Specifically, I'd like a PC that can:

* Play LoL at a decent frame rate
* Record LoL using Fraps (I have a second hard drive I can write to)
* Possibly stream over twitch (I wouldn't record at the same time, and if this isn't possible on a $600 budget, I understand)
* Skype and Spotify while I do this

I was looking at parts to build my own, but at the $500-$600 range it seems like a bundle from a retailer might actually give me a better deal. For example, [this package](http://www.bestbuy.com/site/Dell+I660S-1539BK+Desktop%2C+23%22+IPS+Monitor%2C+Internet+Security+Software%2C+Flash+Drive%2C+%26+Keyboard+%26+Mouse+Combo+Package/9999202500050006.p?id=pcmprd201400050006&amp;skuId=9999202500050006) seems ok...

I have my own mouse, keyboard and speakers (the buyer of my last computer didn't want them), but I don't have a monitor.

What are your thoughts? At that price, is it still more cost efficient to build my own computer? Or would that package (or a similar one) be fine with me?

p.s. Please note, I'm not looking to overclock or min/max. I use my laptop for basically everything, I just want a simple gaming machine to go with it.

1348193942.0,159,self.buildapc,1087uc,Computer Monitor Guide,185,26,59,http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/1087uc/computer_monitor_guide/,"I recently bought a monitor for the first time in over a decade. I'll admit, things have kind of changed. I started hearing about IPS and TN and LED back-lighting and got way confused. I did some research and found a monitor that I liked in my budget. I thought I'd share with you folks what I've learned If you have any suggestions, please let me know. I just started learning about monitors so I'm sure there is a lot that could be added. My goal with this guide isn't to tell you which monitor to buy, but to give you the tools necessary to make that decision for yourself. Teach a man to fish and stuff.

**Determining your goals and setting a budget**

It's important to identify what you're going to be using your monitor for, as it will greatly impact the monitor you choose. A monitor used for editing photos is going to be different than one for general web browsing. If you're interested in photo editing or anything that requires extremely accurate color representation, be prepared to spend more money. Start with a rough idea of what you'd like to spend. Simple monitors can be as low as ~$100 whereas large-format high-end monitors will run you well over $1000. Your monitor is the main output for your computer, and for many is an important part of the computer experience. There is no point in running dual 690GT's through an 18 inch LCD from 10 years ago. Some would even argue to pick your monitor before you choose your parts, than pick a video card to match and build your system from there. 

**Basic monitor terminology**
It's worth mentioning that there industry wide standards for a lot of these measurements don't exist. It's important to take them with a grain of salt. Furthermore, there are a lot of trade offs between properties (e.g. color is a trade off with response rate). For a good post and links to more information, [this excellent comment by nubbinator](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/1087uc/computer_monitor_guide/c6b8n0h) is a good read. 

* **Resolution**: This is the number of pixels wide by high (e.g. 1920x1080). Higher resolutions will tax your graphics card more, but make the image look less pixelated. 

* **Size**: The *diagonal* size of the monitor in inches. Larger monitors will often have higher resolutions. 

* **Response Rate**: How long it takes for a pixel to change from black to white. Lower response rates are desirable because they enable the monitor to better display fast moving images without ghosting. You generally won't notice anything lower than 12ms for everyday use, but competitive gamer's prefer monitors with 2-5ms response rates.

* **Input Lag**: This is how long it takes for the monitor to react to input. Some IPS monitors will have high input lag, so make sure to check it. Lower is always better.   

* **Viewing angle**: The maximum angle at which your eyes can be with respect to the monitor and still have it look nice. Large viewing angles are important for large monitors, particularly when you sit close. This is because the angle between the edges of the screen and your eyes might exceed the viewing angle causing it to look weird. To calculate the viewing angle you need, you can use   2 * (90 - tan^-1(Distance from Monitor / (screen size / 2) ) ). I think this is right, but if someone could double check it would be greatly appreciated. 

* **Contrast Ratio**: Ratio of the brightest whites to the darkest blacks. Monitors don't typically exceed 1000:1 contrast ratios but a lot of manufacturers have started measuring ""dynamic contrast"". Dynamic contrast should be taken with a grain of salt, as its performed with the backlight turned off (which typically isn't how you use your monitor) 


* **White Point**: This is the ""temperature"" of the screen. This is not a change in heat, but rather a change in the color character of the white light put out by your monitor. If you want to learn more, as well as info about calibrating your monitor (Super important if you're into graphic design/ photo editing) click [here](http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/symbiartic/2012/01/17/how-to-calibrate-your-monitor/) If you've ever used f.lux you can get a good idea for white point.

* **Black Depth**: This is kind of the opposite of the white point. It's the minimum level of black your monitor is capable of showing. No monitor can put out a complete absence of light (except black hole monitors, but they're expensive at present and weigh A LOT). Lower black points mean darker blacks and generally better contrast ratios. 

* **Refresh Rate** Usually subdivided into vertical and horizontal. This is how fast in Hz (Cycles/S) a monitor can draw an image. This is different from framerate because it includes drawing the same image twice. If your graphics card is lagging at 15 frames/s a monitor at 60 Hz will draw each frame four times before the next frame is loaded. The rods in your eyes experience flicker fusion (images becoming smooth motion) at 15 Hz but the cones can go as high as 60Hz. As such, most monitors are at least in the 60Hz range. Before buying a computer with a really high refresh rate (say 120Hz) make sure you have graphics card that can put out enough FPS to take advantage of it, otherwise you'll be wasting your money. 

**Color Gamut**

This is particularly important for graphic design/photo editing folks. You may not have noticed it, but there are several colors your monitor is actually unable to display. There are several different methods of measuring this, usually a percentage of the colors in some color space. THe oldest (and narrowest) measurement is sRGB which only covers 35% of the colors that you eye can percieve. A 100% RGB monitor, therefore, won't be able to show 65% of the colors that exist. Above that is a AdobeRGB which was developed to set a higher standard. Adobe RGB covers 50.6% of the color space, and above that is Adobe Wide-Gamut RGB which covers 77.6% of visible colors. NTSC color gamut is the percentage of theoretically possible colors to display, and is typically the measurement you see. A run of the mill monitor will be ~70% NTSC color gamut which is totally fine for general day to day use. Professionals will need a much higher color gamut &gt; 90% to properly display their work. Regardless of the monitor you buy, make sure to calibrate your colors. 

**Panel Types**

There are typically three types of panels used. TN+ and IPS are the most common, but there are also VA monitors. TN(Twisted Nematic) monitors are the cheapest to produce and offer the lowest response rates making them better for motion handling. The downside to TN monitors is that they don't tend to have as good of a viewing angle nor as faithful color reproduction (See why I taught you all that terminology). Large TN monitors may discolor at the edges of the display due to the viewing angle. IPS Monitors offer much larger viewing angles and better color reproductions than TN monitors, albeit at a higher price point. The down side is that they tend to have larger responses times and lower contrast ratios. This is less of a problem with newer IPS panels. IPS panels are ideal for large format monitors as well as photo-editing work. VA monitors are kind of like a mix of TN and IPS monitors. You get some of the better contrast and lower response times than IPS monitors as well as higher color reproduction and larger viewing angles than TN monitors. While this might seem like the best of both worlds, many people feel that it winds up being the worst of both worlds. If your'e interested in a VA type monitor, MVA panels are becoming increasingly viable and might be a good starting point. In fact, MVA have the best contrast ratios ever tested. If you're doing regular web browsing or gaming, a TN monitor might be best for you. If you're doing a lot of photo editing or have a huge display, an IPS monitor might be ideal. For multiple displays, TN monitors will work (to save money) but you'll want to tilt them to overcome the poorer viewing angles. These are of course not absolutes, just guidelines. A good IPS monitor will be better for both gaming and graphic design than a crappy TN monitor.  You have to consider all of the above mentioned terminology and measurements in addition to panel type. 

**3D monitors**

3D monitors offer 3D support for video games and movies, but they are much more expensive than other monitors. Additionally, they're often(always?) TN panels so they have the associated benefits and drawbacks. Be aware that your graphics card must support 3D displays and it often costs money to unlock 3D support for games. They're cool and nifty but it might be worth waiting til they come down in cost before you pick one up... unless you really really loved Avatar in 3D. 

**DVI vs. HDMI vs. Displayport**

DVI is pretty much your standard computer to monitor connection, the vast majority of users will use DVI and the vast majority of of graphics cards have a DVI output. Some only have VGA (the blue thing) But there are many DVI to VGA adapters available. HDMI is an input that many people are familiar with and is a good thing to have if you plan on using your monitor as a TV as well. Displayport is a new comer to the monitor market and is supposedly going to replace DVI and HDMI. Many graphics cards support in the monitor world is not ubiquitous. It's better on paper than DVI, but not necessary currently. If you plan on using displayport, make sure you check to see that your video card supports it. 


**Back-lighting**

Monitors use either CCFL (Cold Cathode Fluorescent tube) or LED (light emitting diode). While their are different types of LED backlit monitors, the most common is EL-WLED (Edge Lit White LED) back-lighting. This uses white leds along the edge of the monitor with a diffuser to back-light the LCD (Liquid crystal display).  This is in contrast (heh) to CCFLs which use a tube kind of like a light bulb. LED backlit monitors are better for the environment when they're disposed of, generally have better contrast ratios, use less energy, and are are thinner. For color sensitive work, CCFLs tend to have better color representation over a wider gamut, and are typically preferred. One caveat to LED backlighting, Edge lit backlighting tends to be less uniform and less ideal than full-array backlighting. Sometimes you wind up with bright edges and dim middles if the diffuser are cheap. Full-array backlighting is typically either an array of white lights or an array of RGB LEDs. The latter is more expensive but may be be better with color representation as it is more dynamic in terms of the color of the back-lighting. Think of it as a monitor within a monitor.  

**Glossy, Matte, etc..**
This is largely a matter of personal preference. I hate glossy displays, because if you want to move your computer somewhere where there is a window behind or to the side of you, be prepared for all the time glare. However, if you don't have to worry about glare you might really like them. It's good to look at different monitor types in the store (ideally the one you're considering) to see what you like best. 

**Which monitor depends on the purpose**
To start choosing your monitor, it's great to hit up [PCPartPicker's monitor section](http://pcpartpicker.com/parts/monitor/) and sort by reviews. You can narrow down display-type and other options at the right. Another great monitor buying guide is located [here](http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/viewmessage.php?topic_id=308280). For monitor reviews, check out [TFTCentral](http://www.tftcentral.co.uk/)

* General Computer Use: TN monitors from good brands, with LED back-lighting if you can afford it. 

* Gaming: High Brightness, Low Response times, and low delays. TN panels are great for gaming, though IPS panels are a must if the monitor is large. IPS monitors have gotten much better over the years and competitive for gaming, most gamers will likely prefer them. Very extreme FPS gamers, or those who would rather spend the money on their rig might still prefer a TN panel.

* Graphic Design/Photo Editing: IPS monitors are necessary to see the full range of colors and have a wide viewing angle. Plan on budgeting a large portion of your computer money for your monitor. 

* Movies/TV: Low black level, high contrast, wide viewing angle and an HDMI output. IPS monitors will typically be ideal. 

**Korean Monitors**

One way to get amazing monitors at a cheap price is by picking up korean monitors on ebay. This is a Korean brand that by all accounts are amazing monitors but are unavailable through traditional merchants. You can essentially get good IPS monitors for as low as 50% of what you would typically pay for them. He'res links for in depth information for [Catleap](http://www.overclock.net/t/1225919/yamakasi-catleap-monitor-club), [Crossover](http://www.overclock.net/t/1232496/crossover-27q-led-led-p-27m-led-2720mdp-gold-led-monitor-club), and [shimian](http://www.overclock.net/t/1228062/achieva-shimian-monitor-club) monitors. Also, here's a really good [general guide](http://www.swiftworld.net/2012/04/14/budget-korean-27-ips-monitor-information-and-comparison-of-the-different-brands-and-models/). Above ~$700 budget you begin to see the catleap monitors falling behind other IPS manufacturers and it may no longer be quite the value it seems. Also bear in mind that these are often a roulette game as they tend to have high variability and you've got a snowflakes chance in hell of utilizing the warranty/RMA'ing it. Intend to seriously research the pros and cons if this is something you're interested in doing. Thanks to zxrax and Trill4t2 for the suggestion to add this. 

**Stuck/Dead Pixels**

A stuck pixel is one that is, well, stuck on a color other than black. A dead pixel is one that is stuck on black. Stuck pixels are sometimes fixable, whereas dead pixels are unable to be fixed. To identify stuck pixels you can use [UDPixel](http://udpix.free.fr/) or similar software. UDPixel can also fix stuck pixels sometimes by making them flash different colors. If your new panel has a stuck pixel, do not try to fix it by using the rubbing method. You may damage your display and be unable to RMA it. If it has a dead pixel, RMA it ASAP.

Also, please critique this build. I'm sure it's not optimal.

Edit: this is also hilariously close to the $640 logical increments guide ""good"" build. Just great value to be had, I think.

Edit: I've lowered the ram and case prices to match the Microcenter ad

Edit: screwed up. The motherboard should be this instead. Idk how much that changes.

I gave a short story with the pictures, so I'll try to keep things here short and answer any questions if anyone wants more info/my opinion on things.

Overall, I love this thing. Going from an old 2.8ghz quad with a crappy 5570 to this? Wow. Got lucky with the Tomb Raider and Bioshock deal with the gfx card, so obviously those were the first things to be thrown at it. Tomb Raider on Ultra (Lara ""Bodacious"" Croft with physics-generated hair) at 60fps? This thing does it like a champ. stock. It's also ran Sniper Elite V2, Far Cry, Dirt 3, and Skyrim with HD textures and lighting on max or near-max settings, all at or damn-near 60fps. I know Crysis or BF3 would be a different story, but for everything I do with it, I couldn't really ask for more.

**Issues during build**

Other than my nooby ordering/build mistakes described in the album, I did have one other hickup. Something between my ram, MB and bios didn't quite work out amicably and be default my ram was being read as 1333mhz even though it's 1600. A quick google search and a changed bios setting fixed the issue.

**Future Add-ons**

Money permitting, I want to do a couple of things for both performance and cosmetics down the road. For starters, I'll probably throw a H60 (or something like that) Corsair cooler on the processor and try my hand at overclocking. I hear everyone go on and on about 212 coolers, but I think that giant floating block of heat sink in the middle of your tower is just uglier than hell, and being able to say you have a liquid-cooled computer sounds awesome lol. Of course, it could use a SSD for the OS and adobe programs (I'm a graphic designer), but I find boot times with 8 already really fast. Also want to fill those 2 empty ram slots, possibly go with a bigger power supply and crossfire a second 7870 in there if I decide the next generation of consoles just isn't for me. I may also try cutting out a custom window and throwing some rope LED's in the case, not sure yet.

**Final Note**

I had a blast working on this, and I could type a lot more but I know no one really cares lol.

I came here not long ago to ask for opinions, and you all steered me in some interesting directions. I've since gone through two revisions and ended up with something not only cheaper, but just as capable, if not more so, than my original concept.

**Notes:**

* Yes, I'm aware its not an Ivy Bridge Processor. I bought it over a year ago when I used to work in retail. Got it via an Intel purchase program for $99 (so my $2700 build is more like $2500)

* Processor is overclocked to a stable 4.5GHz @ 1.35v, mid 30's idle, 65 on load

* OS is loaded on my Samsung SSD. The OCZ SSD was my old OS drive on my previous rig - using that for a few games now. The VelociRaptor was also pulled from my previous rig, as well as an unlisted 1.5TB Seagate 7200rpm drive (can't have too much backup)

* My original case choice was a Thermaltake Level 10 GT - almost $300. However I love the Stryker, it's one hell of a rig (HEAVY though - almost 30lbs out of the box, and 50+ with all the stuff inside)

* I will probably get scrutiny for the PSU - However, everyone uses the same cookie cutter Corsair or equivalent - I like a little style with my parts. This PSU is made from Superflower too, unlike previous Kingwin iterations. 

* The PSU is overkill because I plan to get a 2nd 7970 Vapor-X 3GB to Crossfire. 

* Yes I know the colors in the case and on my desk don't match to any damn thing - I'm also somewhat colorblind so...*shrug*

* EDIT: It seems everyone's in an uproar about the stickers. I personally like them where they are. I'm proud of what I purchased and I want to show it off. I'm starting to think some of you won't sleep at night until I change this, lol.

**Some benchmarks:**

* Windows 8 Experience Index - 8.0

* 3DMark 2011 Score: P9743 (Graphics: 9862  Physics: 9851 Combined: 8806)

* Unigine Heaven Benchmark 4.0 | DX11 | Ultra Quality | Extreme Tessellation | 8x AA | FS @ 1920x1080: Score 750 @ 29.8fps

* BF3 typically runs at or close to 60fps up to 90fps on some maps - everything maxed out now, SO AMAZING!

* Can run Skyrim on High Res. pack with 20+ mods at seemingly 60+fps

* Sleeping Dogs with High Res pack - 42-45 FPS solid

* Max Payne 3 on Max (lol) runs like butter and is eye candy/gun porn

* Metro 2033 on max, smooth as silk

Haven't had time to try many other games yet, but ultimately this rig will be built to play Star Citizen when it comes out. By then I'll be Crossfired up and having an Oculus Rift to play with :D Also the Asus 144hz monitor makes a HUGE difference when gaming. My FPS games are solid with no ghosting and I can always spot everything no matter how fast I move around. As silly as it sounds, my K/D ratio even went up in BF3, without even trying. It really does help to have a good monitor. 

Also the Razer is my first mechanical keyboard. People may scoff at the brand, but it's very well made and these MX Blue keys...MY GOD. I can never go back to membrane keyboards. These are so much fun to type on. Plus it pisses my wife off, so +1.

All in all, it was an amazing experience. Nothing compares to the blood, sweat and tears you put into something like this. Turning it on for the first time....mmm, those feels.

And to those wondering...what the hell's up with the name of my rig?

... And technically, some really kickass upgrades for my machine.  We rebuilt it over Christmas (replaced the mother board, hard drive, ram, and CPU).  Had to do it twice, actually, the first motherboard was really warped (think, like, half an inch, we installed it anyway and gave it a shot, but it was no surprise it didn't work).

For me, this was about the best gift I've ever received.  I love my family, but they are Luddites, and technology of most forms was regarded poorly and often banned if it was recreational (no games, for example, I actually scheduled an hour with a therapist to sit down with my mother and convince her at 14 that Pokemon was alright in moderation, just to give you an idea).

While I have always been a gamer, sneaking it in where I could, I have never been tech-y, partially because my own interests tend to be more library geek than technology geek, and partially because I just didn't KNOW anyone who did anything like that.

It is really daunting to have to try to approach an entire field where you don't even have a frame of reference to begin sorting the information you are receiving out into usable bits.  Being able to hold my old motherboard in my hands and physically go over it and make the connections I needed to was amazing for me.  It gave me enough of a reference that, when we moved on to building, I wasn't quite so scared of it (previous experience with messing around with my computers interior was limited to installing my video card, and god that nearly gave me a heart attack).

In fact, when the first mother board proved to be a dud, I actually made him stand back the second time and did everything myself (though I did have him double check everything after I finished, I'm not stupid :p).

So, /r/buildapc, I have had you bookmarked forever, sneaking peeks only to be daunted by the front page full of words and facts and names that I didn't know and felt I couldn't realistically sort out.  I think, however, that it's time for me to make the next step, now that I finally can, and work on building a system on my own.

My mother happens to be in need of a lightweight pc, so I have agreed to try to build one for her.  This brings me to my actual question for you guys (I just wanted to share the story, because I happen to think it's awesome, there are few greater gifts than those of knowledge).

Putting a build someone else assembled is one thing, but I'd like to be able to put together my own, and I don't know how.

I know that all of the parts I pick out need to be compatible.  I know I need to pick a part and build to that (eg, a power supply would determine the upper limits of everything else on the system).  What I don't know would be what numbers to look at, what information I would need to pay attention to to figure out whether things would work together.

Could any of you link me to a guide, or give me a breakdown if you have time, of the key points I would need to know to determine compatibility of system parts?

I would greatly appreciate it, while google is turning up plenty of results and I have a few bookmarked, I'm not informed enough to sort the good from the bad, and it doesn't cost me any pride to ask the experts.

Thanks in advance!",,False,,t5_2rnve,False,,,True,t3_166szj,http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/166szj/so_for_christmas_this_year_my_boyfriend_to_me_the/,

MSI R7950 Twin Frozr 3GD5/OC is no longer on pcpartpcicker for some reason. I got it for £250 with the AMD 3 FREE game offer. Since ive taken the photos i have bought a new LED LG HDMI 24"" SCREEN as this old one was having problems with the VGA-to-dvi adapter.

The only problem i have encountered is that my memory frequency is 1600MHz but my in my BIOS and in CPU-Z it reads as 1333MHz. any ideas?
Case Fans are on full blast constantly because they are all 3-pin. Which is kinda expected out of such a cheap case, but looks brilliant. Don't think i have seen this case on buidapc before.

Other than that it runs perfectly, i never actually knew how much the SSD actually helps!!!! Boot up is insanely fast.

MSI 7950 Twin Frozr is also insane. Smashes through farcry3, Hitman and sleeping dogs (The 3 games which came free with the GPU) with ease on ultra/very high with 60-45 fps. Highest temp Ive seen so far is 68°C. It is quite cold here in the uk so im not too sure if these temps are good or bad.

I have always had interest in doing this, and I finally did the research and made the commitment to doing it.  Since it was my third deployment and money wasn't too much of a worry, I decided to really treat myself.  I mean, I deserve it, right?  (That was rhetorical...haha)  I did all of the research while I was deployed, and slowly bought the parts while they were on sale during my deployment.  Whatever I hadn't bought yet, I purchased a week before I got home.  

The build was really not that hard at all, just kind of time consuming, and nerve wracking at times (I thought I broke everything so many times).  I did have some issues, however.  I first did a desk boot, and that worked without any issues.  I then put everything in the case, got it all hooked up, pushed the power button, and NOTHING HAPPENED.  I was in a state of utter despair.  The motherboard has a light which indicates that power is applied to it, and that nothing is wrong.  I was thoroughly confused.  I took it all back out again, and did another desk boot.  It worked with no problems.  I came to the conclusion that it was shorting out somewhere.  For the life of me though, I could not figure out where.  I had an extra set of eyes look at it.  They discovered that on the back where the motherboard meets the I/O shield, a button from the motherboard (I believe it was the BIOS reset button) was not seated properly.  It wasn't going all the way through the I/O shield, and that's why it wouldn't boot.  

Upset that I couldn't figure that out on my own, but excited that it was finally working properly, I took my build back home to put the finishing touches back on and put it in it's new home beside my desk.  After my initial boot at home to test the LEDs I installed, I noticed that my H80 wasn't running.  I quickly shut it off, afraid that I had fried my CPU.  I took it all out of the case again and tried a desk boot.  The H80 still wouldn't work.  I installed the stock CPU cooler once again, and it worked.  My H80 had broken somehow.  Well it has been replaced now, and everything is up and running beautifully.  

Overall, I spent about $2800; that includes everything, like cable extensions, speakers, microphone, windowed side panel...everything.  I learned a TON by doing this, and I will definitely be doing it again in the future.  Thanks again for the assistance, and for checking out my build!  Comments, critiques, and advice are more than welcome!

**EDIT**

I seem to be getting a lot of comments on the prices that I spent on some things, namely the RAM.

I tried an external build connecting just the CPU + Cooler, Memory and Video card to the motherboard and power supply, and used a HDMI cable to connect to my screen.

NONE of the fans are spinning the only sign of life is the lighted up red power button on the Z87 motherboard, pressing this does nothing.

As this is my first build I wasn't prepared for this, any advice would be extremely appreciated thank you.

Edit: As far as I can tell the Power Supply fan isn't spinning either, could this be a PSU problem? The motherboard is definitely receiving power seeing as the motherboards power button is showing red light.

Edit2: NO IDEA WHAT HAPPENED BUT EVERYTHING IS WORKING NOW!? I did a paper clip test and the PSU fan spun, this actually disheartened me seeing as I started thinking it was a more serious problem with the Mobo/CPU. Connected the power back to the mobo for another try and miraculously the cpu fan starts whirling and everything is going fine, Should have this built by the end of the day, THANKS TO EVERYONE FOR HELP AND SUGGESTIONS.

There are just 18 MicroATX Mid Tower cases on Newegg. The 4th most expensive case listed is under $60 with a PSU, and looks like this inside: http://i.imgur.com/tAJx8Vg.jpg

A lot of the Micro ATX cases on the market are cheap junk compared to some of the nicer ATX mid tower or full tower cases. I realize some people want $30 cases but IMO not all people wanting something smaller than a 20""x10""x20"" case want it to be cheap.

When I see builds like [this one](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aGIb0tws_e4&amp;t=6m0s) (youtube link) with a Titan, 2 SSDs, 2 HDDs etc. in a Mini-ITX case I wonder why more people don't use smaller cases for non SLI builds.

Mini-ITX cases are a bit cramped but at the other end of the spectrum you have people buying 50 lb cases with like 15 drive bays. MicroATX cases seem like a good middle ground.

It's a shame Corsair doesn't make a Micro version of the 600t. Instead of selling it for $60 with stock case fans ship it with AF series fans like [these](http://i.imgur.com/Jz3AUcH.jpg) and let people buy red, blue, or white sleeved cables for the front panel with it.

**TL;DR** WTB good quality MicroATX Mid Tower, can't.

**Edit**: I want to add that the big IDE ribbon cables are gone, people are using optical drives less, SSD's take up less room than HDDs, most people use onboard LAN and audio chipsets instead of PCI sound/network cards so there is less demand for extra PCI slots but people mostly still buy/sell ATX cases even though microATX meets most existing needs (even SLI). Additionally, as [AntiZig](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/19rsot/why_arent_there_more_decent_microatx_sized_cases/c8qs4f2) points out below that smaller volume cases require less CMF (cubic feet per minute) of airflow to accomplish air changes so less airflow is needed for cooling and the fans rated at the same CMF would in theory be more effective in a smaller volume case.

I know the specs haven't been released yet for the game, but I need it to be able to run Battlefield 3 (i know everyone's asking for that, sorry.)

I want the computer to be great for gaming, but also for 3D rendering programs like Maya and other programs (After Effects, Photoshop, etc.) I'm a Digital Media major so I need a fast and reliable system for rendering out scenes. 

I've looked into processors and it sounds like the Intel i7's are what I need, but are there going to be any new chips coming out soon? I'd like to order the pc within a week or two, but is there anything substantial enough for me to wait a month or two for?

Incredibly happy with it thus far, everything is so fast. My question lies in this: what can I do to speed up start up, in regards to my specific system/motherboard?

What I mean is, when my PC turns on, it goes to my bios splash page (press herp for qflash, press derp for boot options) and sits there for around 7 seconds.....then it goes to a flashing cursor for about 4 seconds...then the message ""loading operating system"" displays for around 4 seconds....THEN we actually get into the loading of windows part which takes around 10-15 seconds.

So right away, from power button pressed to the actual loading of windows there's a precursor of stuff that Im not sure if I can cut out or speed up..I poked around the bios and other settings but I admit I found nothing.

My motherboard is a Gigabyte ga-970a-ud3 is this would matter at all.

I realize this is a trivial thing, and I'm probably just anal...but, even pre-ssd, it always bothered me how much stuff displays and loads before windows even begins. I fear I probably just hamstringed myself in that, that is how the motherboard/bios is.

Thanks for any insight, and sorry for a lack of knowledge on this matter.

I actually had $100 of points on my card, so it all came to be around $700 in the end. Totally worth it, I love it.

How'd I do? And DANG, RAM went up in price. I got that RAM for $40 around 2 months ago.

I got this at about $420.. Of course the price will drop lower after I finally buy the pieces. The case was a bit tough to work with, but it wasnt too bad. The Cougar fan and the NZXT fan are both very quiet. All I hear is air rushing out of my case, no squeak or squeal from the fans at all. It was running Portal 2 full out on 1080p last night with a fluid frame rate. I will install FRAPS and try to get a better number once I play some more.

I had no issues. the hardest part was not touching the boxes until everything arrived. I still ended up building it in my old case because the Casecomm took ages to arrive. As did my monitor because paypal decided to use echeque for some reason. The monitor is manufacturer refurbished and works like a charm - not a scratch. Came with warranty too. I saved £50. OCUK were really nice and price-matched most of the components I bought. They have really good customer service from my past experiences so I was really happy. 

Ive never experienced multitasking abilities such as this. It cuts through everything I throw at it like a hot knife through butter. Photoshop and After Effects take two seconds to open. On my old laptop it took about 30. It almost pre-empts my clicks it feels so fast. I installed Just Cause 3 to test the performance and its phenomenal. Ultra high on everything and its super smooth. Loading times are pretty much non-existent. Runs super quiet too - with the case fan being the loudest. Amazon sent me two coolers by mistake (or I paid for two by accident, not sure which) so I might use the super silent fan from that to replace the case fan. Intakes cold air from front-bottom and exhausts hot air back-top. 

The Casecomm has insane cable management considering it cost me £28+ delivery. Check out the pics. I was worried I would have issues with the cabling but the most I struggled with was stuffing it all behind the mobo and closing the back lid. 

I spent a little bit over budget (£700) but I didnt take a monitor into account back then. This will last me a good few years, and should games progress, I'll just pop another 670 in there. 

Spent a few weeks researching and the best tip I can give is **MAKE SURE YOU KNOW YOUR NEEDS** so you dont go overspending on shit you dont actually need. Also, dont get too nit picky about parts: I got too carried away picking a monitor - reading about dead pixels, poor blacks and backlight bleed etc etc. Do a little research but **dont let one bad review put you off**. If you like the look of it; get it. If its broken, you are within your right to return it. This is why I went with reputable suppliers.

From the first time builders who posted on it, I got the impression that they would have welcomed with open arms a comprehensive guide that just explained in brief detail what each component does and what parameters should be considered when choosing them. The intent of this guide would be providing a brief, centralised insight on every key component.

So I started making said guide, which you can find **[here](http://min.us/mzLqnC2LZ#7o)** for the moment. It is currently in pdf format, editable with LaTeX (the source code is on the same folder for anyone that wants to play around with it). 

It will go on a separate wiki page like the FAQ, so people can edit it if they wish, and the mods can easily keep track of changes and roll back if needed. The updates will be entirely community driven -- I'm not claiming any sort of ownership to it, and anyone may do as they please with it.

So now, I need some feedback on it ! Any time you could take to review what I've written would be much appreciated. I have a couple of specific issues :

* Some general trivia on AMD chipsets is needed in the motherboard section to mirror the Intel trivia, but I'm too out of touch with AMD to do that.

* Does the motherboard section need an explanation of power phases, or do we consider that trivial unless the poster specifically talks about heavy overclocking and deal with it on a case by case basis?

* Going down to 4x throttles the GPU, I remember that from somewhere but can't find a source. 

* Should all the guide be voiced passively (i.e. ""one could"" instead of ""you could"", or evading that altogether and just describing the components neutrally)

* The pictures come from a variety of review websites for the moment (not sure if that'll remain as is in the wiki version), can anyone confirm that they fall under Fair Use ?

* Do you think that assuming that the build is for gaming for the guide,  and having to correct people in individual [Build Ready] posts when they're not making a gaming rig is more sensible than avoiding any bias ?

* Mention anything you come across that either *is* wrong or sounds wrong, I have a tendency to make convoluted sentences which may not be in the best interest of the guide.

1355442513.0,150,self.buildapc,14taiy,How do CPU coolers like the 212 plus and 212 evo work? I try to give an engineering explanation.,173,23,42,http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/14taiy/how_do_cpu_coolers_like_the_212_plus_and_212_evo/,"So I'm in my 4th year of mechanical engineering and we learn stuff like fluid mechanics and thermodynamics, which is the study of fluid motion and energy transfer. I started browsing this subreddit a week or two ago and upon looking for CPU coolers, it seems like these two models mention have high reviews. People post about the temperature it can maintain versus other cpu coolers as a comparison and justification to why they're better. This is fine, however, I'd like to give an explanation from an undergraduate engineering perspective.

What caught my attention about these types of CPU coolers is the fact that it utilizes copper heat pipes as the means for transferring heat away from the CPU to the heat sink. Heat pipes are capable of heat transfer several times greater than compared to regular conduction heat transfer (heat transfer through the contact of two bodies). Heat pipes are hollow tubing that have been vacuumed of air and filled with a bit of water. The vacuumed environment creates a low pressure environment. This is important because it allows water to boil at a lower temperature, as compared to say 100 deg C at 1 atmospheric pressure. When any fluid like water boils and changes phases from liquid to gas, it absorbs energy for this transformation to occur. This is why when you boil water at room temperature, it does not exceed 100 deg C even though it's still being heated; the energy is absorbed in the phase change. 

The water close to the CPU boils and turns into a gas absorbing energy. This area close to the CPU has higher pressure due to the new gas phase and moves down the tubes to a lower pressure area (the heat sink part). The heat sink is kept cool due to forced convection (forced heat transfer caused by fluid motion) by the fan. The heat sink is capable of a lot of cooling because it's fins act to increase the surface area of which heat can be transferred away due to forced convection. When the steam gets to this area, it is cooled and condenses back into liquid form. Similarly to when water boils and absorbs energy, here, when the water condenses it releases energy that was stored in the phase change. In a heat pipe, its not uncommon that the temperature at the opposite end of the heat source is actually greater than the heat source point. This energy transfer via absorbing extra energy in a phase change and then releasing it else where in another phase change is what causes this phenomenon and why it makes heat pipes so good at transferring energy compared to normal contact heat transfer.

Some notes about heat transfer. When talking about convection, the heat transfer rate is proportional to the heat transfer surface area. Fins help to achieve this and the bigger your heat sink, the bigger the surface area, and the higher the heat transfer rate. (The 212 heat sinks are huge!). Furthermore, the higher the air flow, the higher the heat transfer coefficient is, meaning increased heat transfer rates. When talking about cooling, all that matters is the rate and not the amount of heat that will be transferred. Copper has one the highest thermal conductivity meaning it disperses heat into its body the fastest compared to other elements on the planet. This is why the make such good heat transfer material.

I hope this explanation helped understand why these types of heat sinks may be so good at cooling.

Our goal for this is gaming and basic school work for the kids when they need to get on the web.  The first thing you will notice is I do not have a SSD and that is because i cannot afford that right now and want to add it in later.  I understand how awesome SSD is but with two kids, my budget is very tight to start out with. In the next few months I plan to add a SSD just not out the gate.  Another goal I have is I need to build this so I can play   in 2560x1440(korean monitor) The games we play  are Quakelive,RIFT,WOW and my sons FAVORITE Garys Mod.  By the end of the year we all plan on playing Elder Scrolls online. Each one of us has our own WOW Characters and we all love MMO’s.  

So our priorities are  2560X1440 27 Monitor  for playing Elder Scrolls online.   I have two parts list and I have already bought the case, power supply and cd drive. 

http://pcpartpicker.com/user/ckpetrone/saved/1VEN i still need to figure out how to come up with the extra cash for this so this build is actually a little out of my budget by almost 200.00  I am selling a few things I don’t need any more and hope to come up with the extra 200 for this.  

http://pcpartpicker.com/user/ckpetrone/saved/1VEh  800 is my sweet spot

I appreciate any help that you can offer to point me in the right direction

I started planning this project about three years ago, when I came to the conclusion that there were no nice-looking cases available. Everything had a strange shape, or pieces sticking out, or LEDs all over the place. I wanted something simple, quiet, no bigger than necessary, and with good cooling... and since I've been working with wood since I was about 5, the material of choice was obvious. Water cooling seemed the best way to keep everything cool and quiet. Construction started about a month and a half ago. I won't include too much text here, just pictures from various stages of construction. Someone unfortunately lost the memory card that had all the pictures between finishing the woodworking and this morning, ie. putting hardware into the case... But most of the construction effort is here. The pictures suck until halfway through, sorry.

So far Corsair has rather consistently shown that it will not compensate damage caused by their products as well as steadily having poorer customer service vs about 1 year ago when they would reply almost instantly (within 1-2 business days)

some links: 
- H100 leaking and no word on replacement and Corsair's new compensation policy http://www.overclock.net/t/1300669/corsair-h100-leaked-onto-my-brand-new-graphics-card-and-motherboard/0_30

-AX1200 problems http://www.xtremesystems.org/forums/showthread.php?282719-AX1200-welded-its-PCIe-connectors-in

http://forum.corsair.com/v3/showthread.php?t=110264



I'm sure that people would've had positive experience with corsair (like me), but just reading those threads IMHO its unacceptable. 

Corsairs new compensation policy is
-$150 for a GPU
-$100 for a motherboard
-I'm not sure what it is for RAM or a CPU

TLDR: Corsair is having QC issues with their H~ series line of AIO water coolers. Their CS is starting to lack compared to the year before and their now only compensating a **amount** per each component now if its damaged by their use of their products compared to when they used to compensate full cost. 

I think we should put some pressure onto Corsair to do something about this.

This is the largest number of moderators that we have ever added at one time, and each one is being brought in with a specific purpose in mind. They're all highly competent people and I'm sure that they are all going to do the subreddit proud. 

The first moderator that we're adding is the baby faced /u/markrobbo96. At only 17 years old he'll be the youngest of the bunch, but his age is no indication of his maturity. Not only is he very active in the subreddit, but he's also highly active in our IRC. He's shown a great deal of ingenuity with his website -- http://www.choosemypc.net -- and we all feel that he'd make a great addition. Wish him luck as he's thinking he'll be studying computer science at university next year. He also hails from the UK, meaning that he might be available hours that us North Americans are asleep.

The second moderator that we're adding is our new CSS monkey -- /u/ThoughtA. Dealing with CSS has always been one of the relative weaknesses in our current subreddit moderation team, and ThoughtA is being brought in to rectify that. ThoughtA is 22 and a computer science student from the good ole USA. We're going to try not to hold the fact that he used to be a /r/gamingpc moderator against him. Their loss is our gain.

Last but not least, we have /u/Reshesnik. Although you might not have seen much of Reshesnik on the subreddit, he founded our IRC channel along with manirelli and has been instrumental in getting it set up and configured. Reshesnik is being brought in to handle most if not all aspects of IRC. He's being added to the subreddit moderation team so that he can see and respond to modmail that pertains to the IRC channel. Of course, you might see him around the subreddit more often performing various maintenance tasks. Reshesnik is the old man of the operation at a withering 33 years old, and is probably yelling at you to get off his lawn. He works as an attorney.

Give them all a round of applause!",,False,,t5_2rnve,False,,,True,t3_1f8gkw,http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/1f8gkw/im_proud_to_announce_three_new_moderators/,moderator

[Video of XBMC + Steam Big Picture very smooth integration](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpiuGChujYo)


[Pictures](http://imgur.com/a/pCMPl#0)

This was a strickly Buildapcsales build. I know there is no sense in having 2133 in a mobo that only takes 1333. haha

I was able to gather the pieces to this build fairly quickly over the period of about 2-3 weeks. I'll break down each part and where the cost came from. CPU/Motherboard combo at Microcenter took $50 off. Memory was a Newegg Shell Shocker deal that came with a $20 rebate. Video Card was during that MasterCard deal at Best Buy where if you spend $100 you could get an instant $50 off, glad I was able to get this as Best Buy took this coupon away within a few hours). Case was a Newegg Shell Shocker as well with a $20 rebate. Power Supply was a Newegg Shell Shocker as well with another $20 rebate.


This build went fairly smoothly. The only part that was a struggle was getting XBMC and Steam to work together. I kept having the problem of XBMC going into windowed mode and not being refocused when exiting out of Steam. I was able to solve this with a small script I found, (if you want this I can post it. I cannot remember where I got it). I was then able to research automatic torrenting using RSS feeds. I used utorrent and set up all my favorite TV shows and I have them download automatically as well as having my XBMC library refresh every 5 min so I can watch as soon as possible. :-D They are presented in the fashion seen in the video above. 


I will admit. I do have two other coolers that I got for dirt cheap, an H60 and a Zalman CNPS9900 MAX. I tried the Zalman first in place of the stock cooler. I got everything arranged and in order then put the cooler down...The mounting screws were too short. I didn't realize that this cooler wouldn't fit on an AM3+ cpu. So I removed it, wiped the thermal paste off and got everything ready for the H60. Mounted the H60 without a hitch and it looked beautiful...then I turned the pc on. The fan sounded like a freaking vacuum cleaner. It was working as intended but was way too loud so I decided to remove that cooler. During the removal process the water block felt like it had a cement grip on my cpu so I had to twist and pull quite a bit. That was a bad thing. I pulled the processor out with the cooler and slightly bent the pins, my heart sank. The next 30 min was bending the pins back in to their original position. Whew I thought I got it :-D. I move over to my motherboard and noticed that during the water block removal some thermal paste had scraped off a bit and fell into the socket. FUCK ALMIGHTY, my heart sank again. next 10-20 minutes I spent cleaning off as much as I could. I reseated the processor and I could feel that the socked was thinking, WHOA WHOA WHOA!!! Your pins are not perfectly straight. They were straight enough so I pushed down some more and it snapped in. I then mounted the stock cooler and prayed as I pushed the power button. Everything turned on!! Checked the BIOS and everything looked good. Now this is my 9th build, I guess sometimes things just do not go smoothly haha. You might remember my [Game of Thrones](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/1072qm/build_complete_the_wall_game_of_thrones_inspired/) build from last August.

",208,59,230,http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/jyw6t/buildapc_psa_unless_youre_desperate_dont_buy/,"Bulldozer is just around the corner. No, *really*, it is. **Unless you're desperate to build right this moment, it'd be a bad decision to purchase parts now.**




**If you're planning on building with AMD** CPUs anyway, wait. Bulldozer might be a better option, and if it isn't better, it should manage to lower the price of your chosen chips. If you have to purchase parts for your AMD build now, make sure your motherboard is compatible with Bulldozer! The motherboard you want for Bulldozer compatibility is AM3+.


**If you're building with a Sandybridge chip**, wait! Bulldozer might end up outperforming Sandybridge in price/performance ratios - especially when you consider how much cheaper AM3+ motherboards are than H61/P67/Z68 boards. Also, there's a pretty good chance Bulldozer will take down the prices of Sandybridge, if Intel wants to remain competitive. 

Oh. And so we're all clear, ***BULLDOZER IS DUE IN ABOUT 3 WEEKS FROM NOW.***

If there's anything I left out, let me know and I'll add it in. :D

-----------
By the way guys, I'm not saying Bulldozer ***will*** be awesome, I'm saying Bulldozer ***might*** be awesome, and it'd a shame to miss out on what could be. It's AMDs first new chip architecture in years, so I think I'm this is relevant to everyone's interests, if you're considering building soon.

He even got the K90 for ""free"" thanks to Corsair rebates ;)

Sadly, his GPU did not arrive in time for the build, and I only had enough time in the day to install Windows sans drivers, but it was a good day. One of the girls was in charge of camera duty, but she was too busy playing Saints Row 3 on the PS3 to take pictures, and I was completely lost in the moment.

Also, don't judge the Sandy CPU. It was ripped out of his old computer (and replaced with an i3 2120).

They are not major, but here I go. A lot of people ask questions, but do not answer them. This is okay, but what will eventually happen is a post every few seconds, overflowing the new section resulting in many people not getting their questions answered. So first I encourage people to answer as they post. Lets say I know about video cards. For every post or two I would answer a question in the New section about video cards. Also we need to cut down on some questions. First don't be lazy, as you experience this subreddit for complex questions about specific parts, compatibility, and others, we tend to ask even simply questions that can be easily researched. For example, what is the difference between an i5, and an i3? This can be asked, but to not overflow the subreddit, a quick google search, and comparing processors on the intel website, and comparing products on Newegg will give you all the information you need. Also, use the reddit search bar. MANY of the questions we ask have already been asked in the past. Do not stop posting, that is what this makes this subreddit great, but also have the courtesy to:

1. Answer as well as ask

2. Search for questions that have already been answered

3. Google your question, if you believe it is general enough

4. Enjoy. With these tips, this subreddit should flow smoothly even with more and more subscribers.

With that in mind, we are pleased to announce that [BuildsBot](http://buildsbot.com) is joining the [PCPartPicker](http://pcpartpicker.com) team!  We are very excited to be working together for this community.

BuildsBot will continue to run at [buildsbot.com](http://buildsbot.com) and duiker101 will continue to grow and maintain it, only with more resources at his disposal now.  We will be working on providing even more useful information through sharing between the two sites.

duiker101 is still the point of contact for BuildsBot feedback, though you're welcome to message me as well - I will forward any feedback I get on to him.  If you have ideas on how we can better integrate the sites, we would both love to know.

This is a situation where I feel like the whole will be greater than the sum of the parts.  While we have some ideas in mind for the sites, we'd love to hear any suggestions you might have for us.

I'm personally very excited to work with duiker101, and I think great things are ahead.

Woo! so yeah, this is my build, it was a lot of fun. took me about 4.5 hours in total, i was taking my time.

It went relatively smoothly. It turns out one of my ram sticks was bad however, sent it back and got a replacement, all worked perfectly after that. 

As seen in the pictures, i had to have my CPU fan a little higher because the ram was so tall, does that look fine? My thoughts were as long as i don't get ridiculous temps it should be perfectly OK. 

Anyways, I've been using it for the past week or so, doing some editing in After Effects and Photoshop and Premiere, works like a charm. my old computer (a 2008 macbook) just friggin crashed whenever i tried doing 3D in Photoshop so this is amazing. (Not to mention it runs Minecraft like nobody's business.)

So thanks BuildAPC! you guys are awesome! couldn't have done it without your help.  It was awesome and I learned a pant-load throughout the whole process. You won't see me with a pre-built computer any time soon.

If I want to install windows/games [already installed on a HD] onto my SSD how do I go about doing this?

Do I just install windows, and just make sure it boots from the SSD and be done?  OR do I have to uninstall from my current drive?

Also I'm assuming I can't just copy paste the games I want from the HD to the SSD, or can I?  Do I need to reinstall everything all over again to the SSD?  Would this cause issues when the game is looking for it on the HD but its now on the SSD?

Overclocking: Yes

Oh well. Now this wasn't meant to be a budget, save every penny possible build. I knew I was going to get good performance no matter what way I cut it so I went with parts that I liked. I happen to be a big fan of nzxt and their phantom case so there was no way I wasn't getting it. Ends up that case supports like 50 fans and I only had 4 xD So I had to find a way to hide the 40 wires that were included. I got the super overclocked 680 because I like nvidia and I was going for an nvidia 3d monitor. I overclocked the cpu to 4.1 GHz for now, I don't have the greatest motherboard so I'm not sure what it can handle yet. I also don't really know how to overclock so I need to do more research on what I'm supposed to do beside just pushing up the speeds. I haven't overclock the GPU yet for the same reason. No idea how voltage, memory clock, and clock speed need to be changed together.


This is also my first real build I've ever done, so it took me a while to figure out where all the wires went. Cable management was a bitch on this guy.

Anywho, I happen to like it, so enjoy.

Just wanted to let you know that I have added the full Intel Xeon E3 series of CPUs to PCPartPicker.  This has been a pretty popular request, especially the E3-1220 and E3-1230.

As with all the other CPUs, I have included the compatibility restrictions for all the LGA1155 motherboards that I currently list.  (Needless to say, with Xeon CPUs, it's quite a bit more complicated compatibility-wise.)

You can find the CPUs here:

http://pcpartpicker.com/parts/cpu/#s=24&amp;xcx=0&amp;sort=a0

Initial pricing right now is for Newegg, though it should pick up prices for Newegg Canada, Amazon (US/UK/CA/DE/FR), and several other places in just a few hours.

This is just the initial set - I hope to expand the server-part offering over the coming weeks.  Soon I plan to add ECC RAM, server-class motherboards (including dual CPU models), Xeon E5 series CPUs, and possibly AMD Opteron CPUs.

Cheers,

Philip

I am so excited to finally finish my build, I am also kind of sad. I turn into a little kid when it's time to build a new computer. So much joy and excitement researching and planning out your own little monster of a PC. I think everyone on this subreddit can kind of relate to me in that way. 

Anyways, I would really like to think the people in /r/buildapc and /r/hardware for enduring and helping me though my endless questions about what parts I should get. I would also like to thank Philip @ **PCPartPicker**, you have no idea how much trouble and time you save everyone that builds computers. I think I have spent more time on pcpartpicker than anyone else on /r/buildapc. I have went through so many different parts trying to find what I want. I've had a 3570K, 3770K, 8320, 8350, 3820, 3930K, and the Xeon 1230v2 as my CPU at one time. Also I was a click away from getting the GTX690 before I realized that I have turned into that power hungry zombie I turn into when I am building a computer.

I am so glad I went with the 3570K over the 1230v2 I was originally going to go with. Just so happens my 3570K is well put together and runs with a lower voltage than what I usually see.

Once again thanks to everyone that helped me with all my questions. This really is one of the best communities I have been apart of.

When you go to shut down the PC it seems to go through the motions of shutting down all programs and eventually the monitor shuts itself off, but the light on the power button stays lit and you can hear the fans still moving. The PC will finish shutting off if you hold down the power button for a few seconds, but I feel as though it shouldn't have to be done like this. Any ideas?

**Edit:** Something that might help; I'm able to use the restart option just fine just not the shut down one. When I do restart, the computer shuts everything off (even fans) and waits 2 seconds before turning itself back on.

**Edit 2:** I upgraded my BIOS from 1.4 to 2.8 and the problem still persists.

It's looking good. I should be able to get in to PC gaming again - that makes me happy.

On the downside, the video card is having issues. It seems like sometimes when the screen updates it does so all blocky (this is using an old monitor, I haven't gotten the U2312HM out yet). I think it's the monitor, but if anyone else has/had the issue please tell me!

EDIT: Downgrading to stable drivers appears to have fixed this - we'll see!

It's a good computer and it looks very okay inside (I'm new to cable management, but it looks fine to me)

All stock clocks because I wanted minimum noise - the GPU gets loud under 99% load but otherwise it's quiet. 

GPU: 40c idle, furmark peaked at 75c  
CPU: 34c idle, prime95 peaked at 56c

All in all, noise is amazing thanks to the case. Very low noise. The fucking hard drives are some of the loudest things in there - fans are all quiet (stock fans on low power - 40-60% all around).

ASRock's bios is good. I like being able to control the fans very easily.

All in all, glad I finally splurged.

Sorry, few pictures right now, and they're unflattering (sorry, flash!)

This one is a build challenge. However, don't be going straight over to pcpartpicker this time! The catch is that you must create a build list **containing only parts available from BitcoinStore.com.**
 
The goal of the build is to create a low-cost gaming computer. **The budget is $500.**
 
The winner will be selected from the submissions by a panel of three judges. Entries will be judged on their raw computing power, creativity, and proximity to the budget cost. Don't be afraid to be creative to set your entry apart from the rest.

**Upvoting/Downvoting has no effect on how a submission will be judged. Please do not downvote other user's posts unnecessarily**
 
**The winner will receive their entire build list for free!** It is assumed the winner will be able to assemble the computer themselves and we will be looking forward to seeing the finished product [Build Complete] thread.
 
We will do our best to include international contest participants, however if the winner requests international shipping and the shipping costs exceed a reasonable amount, we will have to provide arrangements for them to pay their own shipping or the increase over standard shipping charges and if an arrangement cannot be made the prize will be awarded to the runner up.

Anyway, sorry to make another thread on almost exactly the same type of website twice in a week. Bad timing, it just happened to coincide. Its been over 6 months since I last posted about my own site, and I wanted to show it off after making some new updates.

Its been a long time in the making, working on it on-and-off, but Ive finally got it to the stage where it makes accurate gaming builds at pretty much all the price ranges for the US folk. Its a big labor of love for me and I enjoy helping people out here.

Some of you might have seen me around /r/buildapc and I do my best to help people out. This has been a valuable tool which I use primarily to do that - post perfect cookie cutter builds at the different price points.

---

I recently expanded this to other countries (UK, Canada and Australia) so although the Canadian version will be pretty much perfect as they have the same access to parts, the UK and Australian builds may have parts which are not the best for the money depending on sales.

Please note that these are **strictly gaming builds**. I fully intend to keep this updated with sales and updates with parts where possible and this would be made very difficult if I introduced other uses (though I may expand to them eventually)

Drag the slider to select a budget. Release and the site will fetch a build at that price point. You can also click the up and down buttons to each side of the slider to adjust in increments of 20.

You can toggle the inclusion of an optical drive and Windows by clicking the respective buttons.

You can get a link to the build on pcpartpicker or markup buttons to post to reddit or forums using their respective buttons too.

Simply copy the URL in the browser to easily share the build. It contains all the variables you have chosen.

Works in Chrome/Firefox/Safari/IE10 but sadly not older versions of IE as they don't support html5 replacestate which are required.

---

**Please post your feedback** - every single little piece helps me out, and if it is a simple part change because of a sale or one part being better than another, I can easily swap it out. I am very confident in the builds at this point, but Im sure some of the experts here can tear some holes in a fair few of them. As is the nature of something so volatile.

**New features** to add are always welcome, but I can't make any promises. Unless I have the current stuff *perfect*, I won't consider adding new features.

I understand that some of you may be suspicious of my site and whether it is good enough to rely on, but if my generator spits out a bad build I will consider it failed. After all, if it isn't reliable what use is it? Im committed to getting it to a point where it is perfect, bar personal preferences :)

Id also like to thank Philip at pcpartpicker, of course, for the super accurate pricing information and ease of use of his API, accommodating everything Ive needed.

Haven't really seen any builds on /r/buildapc using Lian Li cases, so I figured I'd take the chance to show mine off. 

The case is actually 2 years old, taken from another build I had done back then, but case makers don't really change their aesthetics in that period of time. It originally started out as a college work/gaming machine, but having graduated it's now primarily used for gaming.

**CPU/motherboard:** Pretty standard for this sub. I went Intel over AMD because I just valued single-threaded performance a little more. Runs circles around my old i3-550. Stable at 4.5 GHz right now.

**RAM:** I know, I know. 16 GB is overkill. I started out with 8, but kept getting memory issues when running when running Civ 5 (I have a bad habit of not closing anything). The same set I had bought was on sale again, so I just went for it.

**SSD:** Literally the best purchase I have made. If you don't have one, you really don't know what you're missing.

**GPU:** Would have tried an AMD card this time around if this thing hadn't been so cheap ($180!). Performance is great, but this card made me realize how much I dislike the reference blower design. A lot louder and less effective than the open-fan GPUs I've owned in the past.

**Case:** I've been moving around a lot lately (will move again in August), so I opted for an aluminum Lian Li case. I do love the all metal design and I'm a sucker for brushed aluminum finishes. It's also noticeably lighter to carry than other cases I've worked with.

**5.25 Drawer:** Second best investment next to the SSD. I kid you not.

**Fans:** My CPU cooler fan's bearing was dying, so I decided to replace the case fan and the CPU fan with Cougar Vortexes (Vortices?). They're pretty good budget fans, and the 140mm fan especially is really quiet.

And there it is! Total price for parts (not including peripherals) after sales was about $900. Let me know what you guys think!",,False,,t5_2rnve,1367254810.0,,,True,t3_1dc4pn,http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/1dc4pn/build_complete_lian_li_gaming_build_1100/,

Edit:  Read the submissions requirement.  I'm going to stop reminding people to put their country.  If you don't put it in in the initial submission, you will not be added to the spreadsheet.  I also will not be checking for post edits on your country, so make sure you have it the first time.  

Edit 2:  Since I'm seeing a lot of people not following the rules, here they are again.  Do not enter unless you have 50 comment karma and your account is at least 30 days old.  If you enter when you do not meet those requirements, you will not be added to the spreadsheet.  Only enter after you meet those minimum requirements since I will not be going through and checking to make sure your meet the requirements before the contest ends, only at the time of entry.  And like said before, if you do not include your country at the time of submission, you will not be added to the contest.

Edit 3:  Please do not put abbreviations for the country.  Unless your country is referred to by it's abbreviation in common parlance (USA, UK, UAE, etc), do not put it.

My question for you guys, is really about the case and the motherboard:


* First off, which case(s) would you recommend, which has great air flow/cooling options?


* Are there any motherboard features (or the lack of same) i should be aware of, when building a Micro ATX build (ram size, compatibility, anything)?


* Has any of you any positive experiences with these kinds of small powerful builds? If so, i would love to see some pictures/benchmarks/thoughts about it.
