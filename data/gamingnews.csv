1297099428.0,266,self.gamingnews,fgyeh,To all of our new readers: Welcome!  Let me tell you how this subreddit works.,329,63,56,http://www.reddit.com/r/gamingnews/comments/fgyeh/to_all_of_our_new_readers_welcome_let_me_tell_you/,"This is a community-driven news aggregation subreddit.  I started it last year and its initial purpose was to filter the pure news content out of /r/gaming, with me and the other mods performing regular sweeps and cross-posting the news posts to this subreddit.

I later opened up the subreddit to all submissions in the hopes that the news content would come here as well as to /r/gaming, so that /r/gamingnews would become more than just a series of cross-posts.

Here are some things I'd like for you to keep in mind as our community continues to grow:

 - The mods are content-submitters.  We all have sites we like and don't like for various reasons.  I hear the concerns about too many posts from one site or another, but I can't justify calling someone a spammer when the content being submitted is perfectly in line with the goals of the subreddit.  The readers always have the final say on which posts get the most attention.  This ties very closely into my second point:

 - If you want to see a greater variety of content in /r/gamingnews, then POST SOME, and upvote others who do the same.  I admit we don't have much to offer you except a modest amount of link karma, but it takes a special kind of person to complain about the quality of content without bothering to help us shape the body of content.  The reality right now is that if we didn't have any prolific submitters submitting lots of content from just a few sites, this subreddit would hardly have any content at all.

 - Final point: there will be no public-square drama.  If you have a question or concern, please send a message to the moderators.  Whiny self-posts, attempts at public lynchings, and other forms of rabble-rousing will not be tolerated (comments on posts such as this one are welcome, however).  If you've expressed your concern and you don't like the response you've received from the moderators, please feel free to unsubscribe and start your own subreddit.  If you want to lead a mass migration back to /r/gaming, be my guest.  I want this community to thrive and be the best it can be but, if we disagree on how best to achieve this, my opinion is the one that will prevail.  

My comments here are not directed at any specific person or group.  Those who contribute constructively to this subreddit have the sincere appreciation of the other 4935 of us.  Thanks for reading and, again, welcome.  Please feel free to express your opinions below.  I'm happy to answer any questions.  

 \- insomniaclyric

**Edit** - 4 Hours later: we're creeping up on 5000 readers.  All you have to do now is start posting news links here (even if they are just cross-posts from /r/gaming or the same link you are posting to /r/gaming) and this subreddit will really start to come alive.  Thanks everyone for your supportive comments and for hanging in there throughout our growing pains.",,False,,t5_2rsaw,True,,,True,t3_fgyeh,http://www.reddit.com/r/gamingnews/comments/fgyeh/to_all_of_our_new_readers_welcome_let_me_tell_you/,moderator

In light of such rapid growth, I've decided to make the subreddit public so that we can get some comments and conversations going, should that be what people would like to do.

I have given moderator powers to the four submitters who have signed up so far.  Full disclosure: at least one of these individuals has ties to a gaming web site and posts content from said web site to /r/gaming and now /r/gamingnews.  Because of the tiny stature of our subreddit at the moment, I'm prepared to give all of these people the benefit of the doubt and I trust that there will not be any moderating shennanigans.

As always, control of content remains in the hands of the readers - to upmod what interests them and downmod what doesn't, and to send a message to the moderators if there is something posted which they feel doesn't belong here.  This subreddit will not be a free-for-all; we will keep our content tailored to the narrow scope outlined in the sidebar, as our readers should expect. 

Please feel free to PM me if you have any questions or concerns, either now or in the future.

There have been some great discussions in the comments since I opened up the subreddit and I couldn't be happier with how this project has turned out so far.

Just a few things I'd like to clarify:

- please only use the 'report' button to flag obvious spam, or submitted content which is somehow derogatory, offensive, or otherwise morally unacceptable.  

- If you feel that some piece of submitted content should have been left in /r/gaming because it isn't news-worthy enough or for whatever other reason, you have two options.  The first option is to hit that downvote button with all the wrath you can muster and send that worthless piece of content into oblivion where it belongs.  Your other option is to tell a mod, either by using the 'message the moderators' link in the sidebar, or by sending a quick PM to one of us directly.

That's all for now - again, thanks for reading.
