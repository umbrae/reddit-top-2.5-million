1366133141.0,134,self.MMFB,1ch0xu,My best friend of 5 years raped me a week ago and hung himself last night...,148,14,68,http://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/1ch0xu/my_best_friend_of_5_years_raped_me_a_week_ago_and/,"Well, I guess the title sums it up pretty nicely but here's some backstory (sorry about the length):

Basically, this guy (we'll call him B) and I met when in high school when we were 15. We instantly became best friends and did everything together; we ended up going to the same university and everything. I guess looking back on it now I had him pretty deep in the friend zone and didn't realize it. 

About a week ago we were just finishing up our final assignments this year and we decided to get drunk and high at his apartment to celebrate. His roommate was out of town and nobody else was there. B talked me into drinking/smoking way too much and he ended up telling me that he loved me. I said that I was sorry but I didn't feel the same way, and he forced himself on me. I tried to tell him to stop and push him off but he wouldn't listen and I was way too fucked to do anything. After he put his arms around me and wouldn't let me leave his bed, so I laid there for a couple hours until I was sure he was asleep, and I extracted myself and left.

I didn't tell anyone about it, I know it wasn't my fault but the fact that I was drunk, high, and good friends with him might have made it seem less credible if I said anything. He texted me the following day apologizing and asking if we could talk about it, I didn't respond. He kept trying to contact me for a few days, and after ignoring him for so long I finally told him to leave me alone. He said he was sorry and that he wished he could take it back. 

Yesterday afternoon he texted me for the last time. He said ""I'm sorry about everything, I'll make it better."" I didn't know what he meant by that and ignored him. Early this morning I got a call from B's roommate... apparently last night he had hung himself in his closet and he just found him this morning. He didn't leave a note.

It's afternoon now I've been crying in my room all day, my roommates think it's because B killed himself, and while that's a huge part of it I also feel like it's my fault. I know he fucked up by raping me but I feel like if I had just accepted his apology or talked to him he might not have done this. I'm sure that he killed himself over me, and I feel horrible about it. Literally the last thing I ever said to him was ""fuck off."" The fact that we've been best friends since we were high school kids doesn't help matters. Also, he had depression/bipolar for years, and I don't think this will be heavily investigated because of his mental issues. I don't know if the texts to/from me are still in his phone or anything, I feel like I would have been questioned already if they were, but I have no clue. I'm still waiting for more news.

I have no idea what to do. I feel like I should tell the police, but what's done is done and there's no way to take anything back. I don't want to be the one to slander a dead guy. It wouldn't do anything but upset people, and that's the last thing I want to do. He was a great friend throughout the years and while that doesn't make it any better I just think he made a drunken, fucked up mistake, and he didn't deserve to die for it. I'm normally pretty well grounded emotionally, but I just feel so torn up about everything and don't know who to talk to about this.

My dad was diagnosed 2 years ago with a Frontal-lobe brain tumor, both my parents are doctors, He was 55 years old, and well, I just found out 4 hours ago that he passed away, and I really don't know what to do...

The day before yesterday, I woke up with my older brother (I have two older, one in college, living with us, and one graduated and married) to go to school,

I went to check on him and I found him heavily snoring, (he had sleep apnea before), and his head was on the bed directly without the pillow, so i lifted his head on the pillow and woke my mom and told her, i tried to wake him, but i noticed he wasn't responding, then he still was snoring, she told me to left it more, but i noticed there was something wrong, so i told her to get up and check on him, and it turned out that he had a seizure again...

So, by ""again"", he had a seizure before, and it was absolutely horrifying, and we called an ambulance and such, anyway, and 7 months ago, he had Pneumonia and thromboses, and was in the hospital for 3 months, so my point is, I thought he was gonna pass away in both of those times, but he didn't thankfully, but our lives got turned upside down in those 2 years..., anyway, he turned out to have had cerebral hemorrhage and tumor recurrence, and he passed away...

It really hurts, that I found him in that condition, that I was the last one to say goodbye to him before I went to sleep but I didn't spend much time longer with him, that I won't see him again, I've accepted that he was eventually going to pass away, but, I don't know, it still feels like a terrible kick in the guts, and i really want to cry, but i just can't...

I was staying with my aunt since i had to go to school that day because there was something really important, and i came back to her house yesterday, and no one was home, so I couldn't go and see him, and suddenly 4 hours ago they show up (My mom and 2 brothers) at the door, and they sit down and such, my mom's eye was kinda red, I felt there was something wrong, and my oldest brother told me to ""let's come and sit down"", and i asked him if there's something wrong, and he wanted me to sit down again, there I knew it, he hugged me and told me what happened...

I didn't cry or anything, and we kept talking for the next 2 hours, and I asked him if it's okay if i stay at my aunt's for the next couple of days, and well, I am, and the burying is tomorrow, funeral is the day after...

Anyway, don't know what to say anymore....
I just felt like posting this, because i needed to let off some steam...

At the beginning I would see him regularly, every 2 weeks, but his visits became rarer and rarer, to the point where I would only see him a few times per year. He wouldn't call and I was angry at him for this - I thought he didn't want to see me. At some point he moved to spain and I didn't even know until several weeks later. He moved back and I had no idea were he lived or anything. The last time I saw him was a couple of months ago and it was awful - I came back crying. He had gotten a new girlfriend who was much younger than him, he was drinking tons, taken up smoking again and was obviously very hungover because he threw up in the middle of the street. He was also coming off as very arrogant and rude and I hated it.
Yesterday my mum told me that she had been contacted by the police and that he was dead. I found out that he had been very ill, mentally, for a long time and that his depression was why he had not contacted me for so long - he didn't want to me to see him like that. I think that was also why he had seemed so horrible when I last saw him, he was over-compensating when trying to seem normal in front of me and my sister.
To make things worse, he had tried to call me 2 or 3 weeks ago while I was revising for exams. I ignored it and didn't answer because I didn't want to speak to him after how he had acted the last time I saw him. I can't stop thinking about this and I feel so guilty because it probably made him feel even worse and more lonely (he had gotten divorced again towards the end of last year).

1330592887.0,82,self.MMFB,qcqd5,I just had a really distressing experience on the way back from the Library at 3:00 AM.  MMFB?,88,6,37,http://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/qcqd5/i_just_had_a_really_distressing_experience_on_the/,"Let me preface this by saying I'm not really sure how I feel.  I'm really freaked out and I'm really distraught, but I'm not like angry or sad or anything.  I guess I just need someone to help talk me through this.

A drunk girl was falling all over the place and seemed disoriented just across the street from the library.  So it's really late and it's really cold out and I really want to get home.  But I'm just thinking, what if this girl falls and can't get up or can't find her way home?  What if, even if it's a small chance, I wake up tomorrow and see in the State News or through an email alert that this girl got hypothermia or wandered into the street or something else horrifying like that.

So me being me, I walked maybe twenty yards away from her and call out to her, ""Hey, are you okay?  Do you need me to call anybody for you?""  At first she says she's fine, but I can tell she's not because she immediately trips again.  She has a visible and very bad scrape on her right knee from it.  I call out again, ""Do you need help?""  This time she says yes.

So I go up to her and I try to be really calm and friendly, ""Hey, my name's Matt.  Do you want me to help you get home?""  She says yes.  ""Do you need help walking?""  Yes.  So I go up to her and help her to her feet, and she puts her arm around my shoulders to help her stay upright.  ""Can you help show me where you live?""  She says she lives in Cedar Creek, it's a shitty little neighborhood of apartments right by my dorm, but about a mile away from where we're standing right then.

So we start walking and she's still tripping a lot.  She's visibly bleeding on my new jeans that I got for Christmas... but jeans are replaceable.  Whatever.  But let's focus on the important things.  She complains that she's cold.  It is pretty cold out, maybe 30 degrees.  ""Do you want my jacket?""  She says yes.  So I wrap my jacket around her and we keep going.  She's complaining about her boyfriend, how he should be the one making sure she gets back safe.  She says he's probably screwing some other girl right now.  She says the scrape is from when he pushed her down.  I try not to let it show how horrified I am by this.  I just keep repeating to her, ""You're going to be fine.  We're going to get you back home and when you wake up you'll feel a lot better.""

She's crying and crying about how much of an asshole her boyfriend is.  She even starts asking me why I, some guy she doesn't even know, would help her get home safe when her boyfriend wouldn't.  I tell her, ""I saw you fall and I was worried about you.""  She says that guys don't do that.  I joke, ""I'm an English major, we're naturally effeminate.""  I'm trying to cheer her up because she's really upset.  Then she totally wipes out and drags me with her.  My jacket gets really dirty.  I'm freezing my ass off in 30 degree weather in nothing but a t-shirt and jeans with another human being's blood dripping onto all of it.

We're pretty close to her apartment by now, and I manage to get her the rest of the way without her falling again.  I leave her at her door and she gives me back my jacket.  And now here I am typing this up.

I think I did the right thing.  It was just really distressing and I don't know what to do about that.  I never even learned the girl's name.  I'm going to go take a shower and try to sleep, but I could really use some guidance.

MMFB,80,5,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/jwvlt/girlfriend_of_15_months_died_i_am_17_years_old/,"This is a long story, and a large portion of it you might find objectionable ... but try not to judge, please.

My girlfriend Sofia and I actually met on an online game.  We became fast friends and chatted regularly, and neither of us were actively seeking to meet anyone online, as we are quite social people in real life.  It was kind of a case of ""love just happened"", and within a week we were hooked.  We've had our ups, downs, and everything in between, but overall we had a very mature and real relationship.  It just wasn't something you'd expect from teenagers.

Neither of us would have let anything go beyond friendship if we did not live near each other.  It was just a matter of luck that we did live within two hours of each other.   We began making phone calls, and meeting up after a short while.

Sofia had a rough past and had an undiagnosed disease killing her for years, starting when she was 13.  Her heart was always weak, she got horrible headaches, late and very painful periods, very swollen lymph nodes, frequent infection and fever, everything under the sun, really.  She saw doctor after doctor and received referral after referral.  Tons of medications.  Nothing seemed to get her better.

She was nearly raped when she was in kindergarten, but escaped with a broken finger.  This set up a lot of emotional issues that always affected her.  I helped her through every problem and everything that scared her about relationships and being close with someone, especially a male.  I stayed with her when she was paralyzed with the irrational fear that I'd hurt her like her previous ex's did.  And I stayed with her every night she was barely conscious because her heart was so bad.

I was the reason Sofia was still fighting to live.  She didn't smile a lot because she was always in pain, but she always smiled around me.  I always smiled around her too.  It's the deepest feeling I've ever felt in my life, and I loved her more than anyone and anything.  I could always make her laugh and giggle, even when she's trying not to because her stomach hurt when she laughed.

I can honestly say that even though we are so young, I knew that she was the one I wanted to marry.  I don't really care about what anyone thinks of that, because we were both sure about that one fact, if nothing else.  We treated each other like husband and wife anyway.

We did eventually start having (safe) sex - both each other's firsts.  This happened for multiple reasons.  We knew we were going to be on the aisle with each other one day, so we felt no reason to wait when it seemed to be true love. Her heart was weak, but she knew that eventually it would give out.  That's why she wanted to do it sooner rather than later, while she still could.  Lastly, she wanted to give me every part of herself that she could before anything happened to her.  It turned out to be a great pain reliever, better than any medicine she was on.  It's also the most happy and carefree I ever saw her.  It's really amazing, being able to replace someone's pain with love like that.

After a slow degradation of her health, Sofia's heart finally gave out last night.  I don't know what to feel right now exactly, but I feel such a horrible hole in my heart.  I knew from the beginning of our relationship that this could happen someday because of her illness, and I accepted that - but it still doesn't take the pain away.  She was such an innocent person, truly just that cute, innocent girl who never deserved an ounce of pain.  It killed me to see her in pain every day.  It was so unfair to her.  My only consolation is that she is no longer hurting.

I'm so lost right now, and very depressed.  I feel like I lost half of who I am.  I can't even be happy anymore ... she had her whole life ahead of her and now nothing.  Her health robbed her of a normal teenage life and eventually the rest of her life as well.  I can't fathom why such tragedy can happen to such an amazing person.  I wish like hell that life were fair.  I'm learning a tough lesson too early.  I'm not even out of high school yet.

So like many other days, we were watching the traffic, waiting for the next customer to call or drive up, when we notice a man driving a large red truck reverse from the intersection and squeal his tires across our parking lot. The woman who was in front of him had apparently taken too long at the intersection trying to turn left, and he was fed up. ""What a jerk"" we agreed, and eyes were briefly turned to his vehicle and hers to see what would happen. She then pulls an immediate right instead and also enters our parking lot... a bit odd, but maybe she'd just remembered that she needed washer fluid or something. 

A moment later, a frantic scream of ""HELP ME! SOMEONE! SOMEONE PLEASE HELP ME!"" from our parking lot, even through the closed door we can hear it perfectly. I exchange puzzled looks with Shane, the assistant manager working with me, and head out the door to investigate.
  
I was two seconds out the door, and what I saw... time seemed to stop. Standing next to her car, crying and screaming is a young woman in her mid twenties, holding the non-responsive body of an infant in her arms.  I immediately told Shane to call 911, that there was a baby here that was not breathing. He dials the phone, and I rush back outside with one thought repeating in my head. ""Please don't let it be dead, please don't let it be dead... please, please don't let it be dead.""

I locked eyes with her and in a moment that I will never forget, witnessed the worst moment in that poor woman's life. Her greatest fear had jumped into reality.  Her look was of frantic fury and desperation, combined with a horrified energy, and a helplessness which like a spark, jumped right to me, knocking the bottom out of my stomach. And she pleaded with me, baby in her arms, to help her, to do something.

It was a realization of every parent's worst fear, playing out a hundred times worse than anyone could have possibly imagined; something you wish no one should ever have to go through. Just the thought of which will jolt you out of your sleep in a cold sweat... and here it was before me.

There's a wide variety of crying, but NOTHING compares to the sheer heart-rending sound of a mother crying over her child. It is a different sound all together, because it's a sound that doesn't communicate information, but pure primal emotion.  It jolts the heart, floods the system with adrenaline, and puts you right to the very edge; capable of anything. I never fully understood the stories of mothers lifting cars off their children until I heard that sound.

The 911 disbatcher is giving Shane instructions, and I'm trying to relay these to her, but we tell her to bring the baby inside. I go over to help her and I see that blood is foaming out of the child's mouth and nose. It's tiny face is covered in it, and so is the mom's arm and hands. She starts to bring her child inside, but doesn't want to leave her three year old son who is in the back seat.

I help the little guy get out of his car seat, and try to tell him that everything is going to be alright and to stick close to his mom. The infant is on the counter now, where grimy mechanics routinely plop down power-steering pumps and broken starters, it's delicate presence there, rendering all the commerce meaningless.

What happens next I will swear happened in the span of what seemed like less than a minute. The mom say's it's a little girl. Shane on the phone with 911 and confirmed that she has a heartbeat. We turn her on her side, and still with the blood bubbling out of her mouth and nose, the very fragile baby is able to draw a quick convulsing breath. She is breathing. The mom hyperventilates. I try to dab the blood away with a paper towel, but more keeps coming.

""Just take a deep breath... everything is going to be fine, the ambulance is on it's way.""

I touch the baby's hand, which is not even as big as my thumb. It's cold and unresponsive.

""I heard a gurgling it sounded like she had spit-up. I reached back to clean her up, saw that it was blood...""

And as she's saying this I don't remember watching her say these words, because everyone's eyes are locked on that little baby girl, waiting for that next labored breath.

Sometime during this, before any emergency response vehicles arrive, a customer walks in. Some sort of strange auto-pilot engages. I find myself saying: ""We'll be right with you sir."" The customer surveys the scene and nod's horrified. Absolutely ridiculous in retrospect.

Two more labored breaths go by.

The police arrive. They are there maybe ten seconds when an Ambulance blazes into the parking lot, followed by a firetruck and two more squad cars.

An EMT practically sprints in, immediately picks up the baby, and whisks it into the Ambulance as the police frantically yell, ""Which hospital!""

""Childrens!""

http://i.imgur.com/KTeqfl7.jpg

I manage to snap this picture before the ambulance burns rubber down the street. The police help the woman lock her car, which is still running. They take her and the little boy in the squad car and follow the ambulance. Suddenly everything is over. Clocks start running again.

...   
   
""Do we have any disinfectant?""   
""There's some in the bathroom...""   
   
...   
   
I clean up the blood from my counter as the store sits in a stunned silence.

I remember selling people parts for the rest of the day, but that happened like I was watching a movie on mute. In the background. I zoned out and my thoughts kept straying to that little baby on my counter, bloody, gasping for breath. I'm going to remember that image forever. I remember the color of the one-sie she had on, pink and blue flowers with lime green trim.

The police came back later. ""She was alive, but it wasn't looking good"" they said, and refused to elaborate. They asked us some questions. We learned that the child was only three weeks old. They took down my information, in case they needed to hear what I'd seen. As they're asking questions the crime lab rolls up to take pictures.

It occurred to me later that this sort of evidence gathering is standard, in case it was a situation of child abuse. I didn't even want to contemplate that thought, but they continued to ask the questions. My shift ended. I went home.

The more I thought about it, the more I couldn't understand what had happened. Babies don't just start bleeding for no reason, it made no sense. Why did this happen? Was she ok? I hoped she was.

I was out of milk.

Later, standing in the grocery store staring at the wall of milk, the time traveler in me imagined all the things that that three week old girl could have grown up to be. The life she could have had, which may have been drastically cut short. The birthdays, the graduations, the late night study sessions and messy morning making Christmas cookies... all violently ripped out of time, never to exist. Suddenly and for no reason a happy healthy baby girl was taken away from her parents, after only three weeks of being alive. A completely helpless, innocent life... The injustice of the whole thing suddenly fell on my shoulders, and I cried. There in the milk aisle in front of a perfect strangers I just started crying.

And as I retell it now, I feel that same crushing sadness wash over me. It will be a long time before I will be over this. At the time of writing this, I don't know if that little girl is alive. I will try to find out. I hope she lives. I hope she lives a full happy and productive life... and learns to play the cello, and dance, and have chocolate cake... and never ever take her life for granted. I hope so much that she's ok...

I'm sorry if this is more personal than what I normally put on here, but I needed to get this out. I needed to tell this story, perhaps in the hopes of somehow dealing with it...

**tl;dr: I watched a newborn baby almost die on the counter at work.**

UPDATE: I learned that she is alive in the PICU. Fingers crossed.

UPDATE: The father came back to retrieve the car and said the doctors believe a blood clot burst near her heart, an almost un-heard of thing, with no way to predict it. She was admitted to the ED in full cardiac arrest. As of yesterday morning she was still in critical condition, but alive.

My GF lives in the same town as them, and I figured I'd stop by and see her afterwards.  My parents and youngest brother and I went out to dinner at the local Pizza Factory, and about halfway through the meal, she walks in with her ex.  She immediately saw me and I saw that look in her face, like she knew she'd been caught.  I had no idea what to do to, I just sat there, it was extremely embarrassing.  My mom asked me if I wanted to leave, but I didn't want us to get up and leave halfway through our dinner on my account, I would've felt bad.  My GF and the guy didn't stay long, she walked out looking pretty embarrassed as well.  As it turns out, she and him had been talking and flirting for awhile prior to this happening.  He'd been sending her flowers behind my back, and I don't want to think about what else may have been going on.  This is all made worse by the fact that not too long ago I was struggling with major depression.  I never wanted my parents to see that side of me again, I know they worry about me, but to see what I saw in the restaurant only made me feel worse, and I felt like I let my parents down by getting so broken up about it.  I know that's not the case, but that's what my depressed mind convinced me of at the time.  I'm feeling pretty terrible right now as you can imagine.  This all happened after I dropped about 1,500$ on a weekend in Vegas for her birthday, so I feel pretty used.  And I can't count the number of times she told me that I treated her like no other guy has, that I was the best man she'd ever met.  She would also say that she was the most honest person I'd ever meet and that she'd never play games, so I guess I'm just a little in shock right now.  I don't really know what I'm looking for on here, maybe somebody else has gone through something similar, but I'm feeling pretty terrible right now.

I miss my mom. We had a really difficult relationship growing up and we had just managed to repair our relationship when we found out that she had stage 4 lung cancer. We got two months of complete happiness with one another. I would help her out; take her to her doctor appointments, bring her groceries, teach her the Internet, come over and cook for her and take her garbage out and clean her apartment. I brought her presents - a necklace, one that she loved especially, and one that I am wearing now.

Instead of being able to call my mom in the middle of the night, now all I have is an urn full of ashes to talk to - and urns don't talk back. They just sit there and be urns. 

I knew she was dead the night before I found her body. I called her and asked her to get online so we could chat. She said she would, and we told each other we loved each other. She never got online. And she would always be online within 5 minutes of telling me she'd get on AIM. 

I came over the next day after therapy fully expecting the worst, and I found the worst. Slumped over in her chair, covered in blood. There was a full cup of water sitting by the sink - the cup of water she said she was going to get before she got online. The sink was full of blood, blood leading from the kitchen to the living room, culminating in a giant mess of blood underneath of her, in her chair, where she passed out from blood loss and died. 

I can't get the image out of my head. I can't get that video out of my head, that video that plays and plays where I can see exactly how and when she died.

The only thing I can take solace in is that the last things we said to each other were that we loved each other. I just know she was scared while she was still alive, and bleeding so much. And I never wanted my mother to go that way. The day before she died she had just found out that her tumors were shrinking, and that some had gone away entirely. We thought she was getting better.

Over the last 14 months I have slowly been losing touch with her. I believe that she has been embarrassed about her situation, only wanting my mom to help her and provide support. I will admit, I am bit scared and keep my distance (especially recently). This entire journey has been so hard on her. She has went through radiation twice, her boyfriend of 3 years broke up with her because he couldn't handle the stress it put on their relationship (fucking pathetic), and she has now lost all mobility and her ability to speak. As I type this, I can hear her sleeping in the next room. Her shallow breaths and the growl of the oxygen machine she is permanently hooked to have a pretty ominous feel. It makes me sick to my stomach. I am at a loss for words on how I feel. I have never lost someone close to me, and I'm not sure how to cope with these feelings of sadness. I wish I had spent more time with her. She really is an amazing person that I never imagined losing. Obviously I spend as much time as I can with her, but between working full time and going to school, it is certainly less than simple. It tears me apart to see how quickly her condition is deteriorating. Just a month ago she could walk (with heavy assistance), and speak very clearly. I want to be there with her as much as possible, but lately I find it difficult to maintain my composure when I'm around her. For fear of making her upset, I have hidden in my room for the past 24 hours, bawling. She speaks of angels being with her as she sleeps at night, and its comforting to know that she isn't scared of dying. I just don't want her to. :(

Edit: She passed early this morning. Thanks for your kind words.
Edit 2: I have read and reread all of the wonderful things you all have said. Although I feel like this is a dream, I am surprised by my lack of sadness. Sure I am upset, but I feel really numb.

Guys just don't talk about things like this where I come from. A small midwestern town in the USA. However, after some years, and thanks to the help my dearest friends, I went to a mental wellness center and I have been able to talk about being a victim of rape with others who have had similar experiences....  This is my story.... 

While at University I went to a party with a girl I was dating. I didn't know anyone but her there. We split up and said we'd meet up later on and I was having a nice time, but apparently in mixed company.

 I had a nice conversation with a man and ironically talked about dating and Love. He was from a foreign country, had money, nice clothing, good looks and a nice car, but wanted to know why women wouldn't date him. I told him not to worry and that he doesn't want to find a woman that is after all those things. That he should be patient and the right one would come to him... He seemed receptive and we exchanged contact information so I could help him with his English and that we could establish a friendship. I feel I made a great friend that day. Still do. He was a very nice man amidst a crowd of what turned out to be, very disturbed people.  We had been drinking pretty heavily and I was a little out of sorts, but nothing I'd consider dangerous... Certainly felt I had my wits about me... Last I remember was someone coming out giving us shots of vodka, then... black..... 

Before that I'd never not remembered going to bed and only one time after that, has that happened. The second time I was luckily with a close friend. We were at a bar, I had a single drink felt awful, told her I needed to leave and blacked out. My friend brought me back to her place and I apparently puked all night long.... So, I've been drugged twice and luckily, only the first time resulted in rape. 

Back to that night....   After that shot of vodka, I am guessing I was still able to convey how to get me home, and me weighing 220 pounds, I am guessing it took two people to bring me there... I was brought up to the third floor, into my apartment, and then raped. I was 20 years old.... 
From the looks of the aftermath I've concluded that it was indeed by 2 individuals... I woke up to a horror scene. I was slumped over the end of my bed with my pants halfway down my thighs. Feces was on the floor and in my underwear. There was vomit all over the bed and nightstand and the smell still brings me back to that day...my hemorrhoids being as bad as they are right now, have the same odor and I feel this is why I am able to remember so much of it right now.  Though, when I can sit down without flinching, just thinking about it can bring up the odor. It is like reliving that experience...

 In a daze I walked towards the bathroom to try to get sorted out. I was in shock. My body was shaking and I felt on the brink of passing out...I felt cold and my skin was pale white when I looked into the mirror upon entering the bathroom. Looking down at the sink, I found a note from my roommate.... He had left it there thinking I had got so drunk that I had defecated on myself and the floor, not been able to pull up my pants after a failed attempt to poop, puked in my sleep and left a huge stinking mess in the apartment and left my door open for him to see.... The note said things like, hey SHITTY roommate, you need to clean your SHITTY mess up. This is a bunch of bullSHIT and you smell like SHIT you scummy SHITbag. the note went on with every word SHIT being in large letters. This didn't help me any and I immediately found myself crawling into a shell... It was surreal. Like I was in some sort of twisted movie... 

After standing in the bathroom for a few minutes in disarray,  not believing, or not wanting to believe, the truth of what I was seeing, feeling and smelling, I stumbled out and went into the kitchen. What couldn't get any worse, did, as I found a dried pool of blood and what appeared to be dried ejaculate on the kitchen floor. After reading the letter and then seeing this I decided that I couldn't possibly tell anyone about what had happened. I was a college athlete. No way would anyone respect me if I said anything about this...

As if in some nightmare I just began to clean everything up. It took a few hours... First cleaning the feces off of the floor in my bedroom. Then taking my soiled and stained underwear, throwing it in the trash and taking the trash out. Then, washing the blood and ejaculate off of the floor in the kitchen... After cleaning the shared space of the apartment, I then took a shower to try to wash away what couldn't be washed away in the shower.... Feeling my collapsed and tattered butthole in utter disbelief I began to wonder... Why did this happen to me?? How? What have I done to deserve this?

I thought that since I had told some friends and family that I FELT like I was Jesus amidst a very intense spiritual experience the summer before I was raped, this was why. God's wrath... I also Blamed myself for being a fool and being so careless trusting people I had just met... I began worrying that I had some disease and I was going to die of some STD for what I'd said... Thankfully after being tested several times over the next years, I have come up disease free. Thank God for that.

Then, I had to start cleaning my room. Vomit was on my covers, sheets, clothing and nightstand so I had to take everything down to the laundry room on the first floor. Then, I washed my nightstand and alarm clock. 

After that, a splitting hangover came over me. I sat in my room alone while my roommate and his girlfriend didn't say anything to me for being a SHITTY roommate... Once my laundry was finished I put everything back in as best order as I could. Thankfully the puke washed out ok. I couldn't really eat or think straight for who knows how long after that. I had the worst hangover of my life and felt like I was outside of my own body til late that night and still weird the following days... Going to the bathroom was a reminder each day for the next week or so as I was healing physically and it has never really felt the same since that moment... 

 I never told anyone about this until about 3 months ago... To be mentioned is I have terrible hemorrhoids because of it and it has been my reminder of that night/following day, for 7 years running. For 7 years I felt like they had put something inside me that didn't belong there. I felt like some alien lived in my body from that day forth and that it was always watching me somehow...

 After finally speaking about it I feel I have finally been able to grow again and have been able to fully forgive them. I understand that they must have had something bad happen to them in their life that they would do something like that to me... I feel lighter now... I've met and know what it's like to have friends that have experienced things like this. All the people I've spoken with at this point are women and I haven't met any men to talk with about this... I feel that my women friends that have also gone through this, actually see and understand me. I've  found great comfort in knowing that I am not alone in this. They and the friends, family and counselors I have shared this with, have been so kind and helpful to me. The tears that came amidst coming out about this have been the only waters that have been able to wash the stains of that day from my heart..

 I know there are more women out there and I'm certain there are men out there, that have gone through this that could benefit from sharing their story with me and/or with family and friends... I would like to extend my hand in friendship/brotherhood to anyone who has been through this or any form of relationship/sexual violence or abuse and would like someone to talk with. Talking about it has helped me immensely and I would just like to offer this opportunity to others...

Also, if anyone has any remedies/holistic balms/salves for hemorrhoids I'd greatly appreciate the help. When I spoke about it the first time I hada major flare up and I was in a lot of pain, bad swelling and the odor is very strong. That was the worst episode of hemorrhoids in my life and, and it seems, it is directly related to talking about it for the first time. Fascinating how the mind and body is so connected.

I'd also like to mention that I don't feel that the friend I made that night had anything to do with it. I don't even think he knew about it even though it was his friends' party. 

He had called me a few weeks later to see what I was up to. I was going to see some family so I was unable to meet up with him... I was also still reeling with the fact of what happened and wasn't exactly ready to go spend time with him either though...I wasn't ready to face that music yet... I just hope that if he found out about it, that he doesn't feel I blame him for it, nor think he was responsible...

 I also no longer blame the two men that did this to me. They have far greater problems to face than I do. I just pray that they can find peace in their hearts and forgive themselves for what they've done. I've forgiven them. They aren't holding me down any longer...

I also don't want my former roommate or his girlfriend to feel bad. They didn't realize what had happened. They just thought the wild child had finally gone too far. They've both been through the toughest times of my life with me and I Love them dearly. 

Amidst it all, I've found that Abuser and the Abused are equally worthy of compassion. Abuse only comes from a feeling of lacking something. Love, Compassion and Goodwill are the only things that will fill that space... Being abused made me feel like I wasn't worth anything more than abuse...and certainly not worthy of a fulfilling Love relationship... However, Once I began to tell my story and others extended compassion to me, this is when I stared to find real Peace..... I am ready to go out into the world now :-)

My Name is Louis and I hope this helps someone out there. Thank You for Listening. Feel free to share with me. I'd be honored to help.

I found out we share some common interests, and me not having anything to do, I went to visit her at her store maybe once or twice every **two months.** I visited her maybe 4 times over the span of a Summer, and at the very last time, I heard her talking to a customer about how she couldn't stand me or my girlfriend visiting her and how big fucking pains in the ass we were. Well, that fucking sucked.

I am part of an online forum, and I asked a personal question there when I was having real bad family issues. Eventually everyone started attacking me for no reason and called me a bad person, when I literally didn't do anything.

All of my peers have completely different likes, dislikes, ethics, and beliefs than me, so I'm not friends with many of them, and most dislike me for no reason other than ""I'm different.""

So, people just fucking suck, or I suck. I don't know. Oh well. I hate people. :(

Just wanted someone to say that too. Sorry. Turn CSS off with Reddit Enhancement Suit and then downvote this post, please. ",,False,,t5_2sjdn,False,,,True,t3_p16di,http://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/p16di/people_are_jerks/,

He looks at me, upset, and says ""Oh, right... well, then you can't work here. Bye.""

I was stunned, and left feeling humiliated and beaten. I tried not to let it get me down, and immediately marched into every store I could see. Most places wouldn't even let me finish asking if they were hiring before shooing me out or interrupting with a condescending ""Nooooo.""

Have no one to talk to about it.",51,5,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/on3ck/husband_died_4_years_ago_thought_i_was_over_it/,"TL;DR: Husband died four years ago, leaving me alone to bring up my baby. Thought I was over the worst, lately I've realised I'm not over it at all. Still completely in love with him, and it hurts. In a new relationship but struggling to deal with it.


I met my husband when I was 18, married a year later, son born a year after that. When my son was 6 months old my husband died. I fell apart, but kept it together on the surface, because I had no choice, and babies are a good distraction. People would tell me they couldn't believe I was coping so well, when actually I wasn't at all. Just kept up the facade and tried to get on with it. The first 2 years afterwards I was just numb, did what I had to do and avoided dwelling on my feelings. Once I started to feel a little less numb, I completed a college course and got accepted for a degree course. But during this time I was also seeking out comfort in the wrong places, flings and one night stands, ensuring I didn't get too close to anyone.

6 months ago that all changed, I met a lovely guy and began a relationship that actually felt like it could work. The last month or so things have suddenly got a lot more difficult, all the feelings and grief that I've spent the last 4 years avoiding, have suddenly hit me. I feel like I'm right back in the first stages of it again. I've quit uni. I'm unintentionally distancing myself from my boyfriend. I've distanced myself from most of my friends and family, I'm avoiding contacting or seeing anyone. I can't talk to them about it anyway, no one really understands, and I don't expect them to. I just feel down, really hopeless. Like no matter what I do, what changes I make in my life, I'll always be the girl who was widowed with a baby.

Lately my son, who just started school has become very aware of family. I've spoken to him, shown him photos, tried to ensure he knows he can talk to me, but 4 year olds aren't too great at sharing how they feel about difficult situations. He has said it makes him sad that his Daddy is dead, and that he loves him. He's recently become quite anxious about death, probably 2-3 times a week he'll say that he doesn't want me to die. I've been honest, and admitted that everyone does die, but it won't happen for a really long time, and that he's not got to worry now. I find comforting him, and discussing his Dad's death really, really hard. I don't (and never have) discussed everything with anyone, I find it too hard to talk about, and just close down when the topic is raised. He's hinting that he wants my boyfriend to fill the role of dad. I don't know if either myself or my boyfriend are ready for that.

I'm really confused about where to go from here. I had stupidly thought I was over the worst, (or at least, as over it as you can get) but fear that if I don't try to actually figure out how I'm feeling that this will keep happening, and I don't want to spend the rest of my life in this limbo. I'm going to see if my doctor can refer me for counselling, but I find opening up to anyone so difficult, that I'm not sure how much it'll help me. I don't know what to do about my current relationship, whilst there are small niggles in the relationship itself, the main issue is me, my past, and the effect it has on me. I don't know if it's even possible to deal with these issues whilst in a relationship, or if it's fair to drag him into it. He is, and will always be second best. If I end the relationship I hurt myself, my boyfriend and my son. If I keep it going I feel like I'm burdening my boyfriend, who before meeting me had no issues to deal with. Also, if I try to maintain the relationship and fail, it's going to make it worse for my son.

I've quit uni, as the stress wasn't helping, so I now have no idea what I'm going to do long term either, but I'd be happy just sorting out current issues at the moment.

In April of this year we found out we were pregnant. It was a complete and utter surprise - I was on the pill - yet, somehow, it happened.


We were terrified at first, but a few months pass and our excitement grew.


At the five month ultrasound we find out she has a problem. A very large problem called Epstein's anomaly. Her heart is too big. Way too big. Her body won't be able to support it and her odds of survival are essentially zero. We are mortified, terrified, and beyond - but I was still pregnant and at the time we had to just focus on the day to day pain and pressure of pregnancy.


Two months later, I go in for an ultrasound and they find no heartbeat. I was induced. My first epidural didn't work so I spent a lot of time in pain. My contractions were too close together for hours so they had to give me medication because my body was wearing out. And then, at 2:38 in the morning on October 28th, 2012, she was born. They wrapped her up and we sat with her and cried. They sent her to the morgue.


It has been a month. I go to work every day, come home. I don't really cry, I just feel this deep hollowness in my chest. I'm sure that anything that could be said here is something I've heard before, but.. I don't know. I just don't know.

She's put a lot of love into collecting them from everywhere she can during her travels around the US and Canada. (TINY sample of the collection: http://i.imgur.com/VQotV.jpg)

Unfortunately, she was recently diagnosed with breast cancer. The prognosis is very good, and she's expected to win as it was caught fairly early. That's the good news. The bad news is that her treatment plan involves at least 6 months of chemo starting soon and perhaps a year battle all said and done. Here's some proof, I know it doesn't say BC on it, but it's the best I could do quickly this morning on the way out the door with what I had. (proof: http://i.imgur.com/hKqIp.jpg)

I was hoping to use the power of the Internet and Reddit's kindness to overwhelm her with business cards from around the world. Do you think you could spare a stamp and a few minutes of your day to drop a few cards in the mail? They don't have to be yours. They could be a card from the restaurant down the street, the dentist office, a roofing contractor, a mechanic,  one of your colleagues... it doesn't matter. Just grab a few during your travels and anonymously drop them in the mail. Just a few cards from cool places will go a long way. Even if you can't send some cards, how about an upvote to get this in front of more people?

I can't thank you all enough. I'm using a throwaway and a PO BOX to protect her privacy.

Last Saturday night, my friend and I were walking a few blocks from a bar we go to every saturday night. I was extremely intoxicated and we were walking a few blocks away from the bar in order to find a place to pee by the river. Three guys came up from behind us and started attacking my friend. I tried pushing one of them off, and starting fighting with him. Me and the guy were exchanging blows (and I think I was winning) when I was hit by a second guy with a pair of brass knuckles. I believe I fell into a wall and hit my head again. I was out cold.

The next thing I remember, I was three blocks from the scene asking my friend whose blood was on my hands. My blood was on my hands. I had a huge laceration on my head and I was bleeding badly. I don't remember anything that happened in that 10 minute window from when we were attacked to when I was asking my friend what happened. I should have been taken to the hospital but I couldn't think clearly.

My friend was hurt, as well, but he wasn't hit with brass knuckles. I was knocked unconscious and beaten while I was down. I went to the hospital the next day, and I had bruises all down the back of my neck. 

I don't know anything of what happened that night. I feel violated. I can not get over the image of myself lying face down in my own blood, unconscious, being hit over and over again. I didn't want to go to the hospital because I could not afford any hostpital bills, but I ended up having to go the next day when the bleeding from my head wound would not stop. The nurse told me my laceration was 2 and a half inches long and 6mm deep. I didn't realize it was so severe. My cut required 5 staples to close. I have a broken nose and a broken ""auxiliary sinus"". I can't eat solid food because my teeth on my right side are somehow damaged and hurt when I chew with them.

We did file a police report that night. The cops said I wouldn't have to pay anything in the hospital because I was the victim of battery, but I am now looking at upwards of 4 thousand dollars in hospital bills. 


I cannot focus in class. I feel like permanent damage has been done to my brain. I hear my teacher say a sentence but I cannot remember what it was so I can write it down. I cannot focus on anything besides last saturday night. 

I'm hoping somebody can relate to me a similar story where they were knocked unconscious and beaten, and where their brains were malfunctioning for a short while but eventually they were fine again. I hope that my head will be okay soon. My mind is most important to me and for it to be damaged permanently is incredibly scary to me. I hope it will be okay again someday. I hope that I can focus in class again someday. 

TL;DR: I was hit with brass knuckles and beaten further while unconscious. I had a concussion and now I cannot focus on anything in class. I feel stupid now.

I wasn't raped, or even molested really, but I feel so intensely violated that I haven't been able to function for over two years.

In November two years ago, I had just gotten my license and my dad decided to let me drive up to his best friend's house(like an uncle to me) in the Bay area and sleep there for 2 nights and see the city with him before I go to visit my grandmother for thanksgiving. 

A year prior, at a family bar-b-q he touched my inappropriately in the jacuzzi and I told my dad right after. My dad was livid and had a very long talk with my uncle (lets call him jesse since thats his name). So after Jesse talked with me and explained me ""meant nothing by it"" and was ""just joking around"". But ever since then I felt kind of weird around him. I don't think I'm overreacting but everyone else seemed to forget so I just kind of ignored it. 

Fast-forward a year and its Nov and I'm at his house. Every night he had wanted me to sleep IN HIS BED WITH HIM. Keep in mind im a fucking sixteen year old girl. I can handle my own shit and can sleep on a couch ALONE. So I was firm and did not sleep with him. But the last day I was there, my grandma called to see when I was going to come over.

He flipped.

Once I hung up he screamed at me for what was about 45 minutes. He made me call my grandma and tell her I wasn't going to see her. The whole way home (we were visitng colleges) he told me I was stupid, a biggot, and all other sorts of stupid shit. 

Sorry this isn't written well but I'm just spewing out shit as it comes to me. I think I should also mention that he was fired from his job at a children's amusement park for inappropriate behavior with a young teenage girl (not consensual obviously). 

Anyway, we get back to his place and by now its storming. I grew up in SoCal so the most we get is some rain and maybe a little wind. This thing was a STORM. The power was out so it was dark and we were in his room. I told him I was hungry and he just starts screaming that I'm a ""fucking stupid bitch"" and a ""spoiled brat"" and all this other horrible things. I grew up in an extremely loving family. I'm not kidding when I say my parents have never said a hurtful thing to me IN MY LIFE. So hearing this was not only a huge shock but these words physically hurt me. 

Of course I started to cry and his whole demeanor changed. He asked why I was crying (WTF?) and asked if it was because of my parent's current separation (it wasn't). I got up to leave and I swear I have never seen anyone move as fast as he did. **He sprinted to his bedroom door and blocked the way.** 

Right then I knew I was in deep shit. I tried to stay calm as I went to my suitcase and started packing my things. He walked away from the door and (ill never forget this. its the most terrifying thing that has ever happened to me) I just remember seeing his two huge feel cluck loudly on my left side and noticing the detail of his shoelaces as I hear him say **""If you think you're going anywhere, you're sorrily mistaken""**. 

I remember thinking that there was no way in hell that was going to be my last memory as a virgin or just being alive. I took my chance and scrambled to the door. He grabbed at my ankle and I kicked and ran downstairs. I grabbed a knife and ran outside and was soaked instantly. My phone was in my pocket so I took it and called my dad. I stood right under a streetlight so if there was anyone they could see me and help. I was sobbing and screaming but the storm was so loud no one heard. I thought I was going to die and it felt like a horror movie.

My dad answered on the third try, and once I was able to tell him what happened in coherent sentences, he told me to GO BACK INSIDE! I thought he was insane, but he never steered me wrong, so I went back in. He asked to talk to Jesse, so I gave him the phone. They argued for a minute or two, and then he gave me my phone back. My dad told me to go get my stuff and go straight to grandma's and that Jesse would not stop me. I did just that. 

As I was trying to leave, he blocked the door again. This time I was not having it. (I still had the knife.) I told him that if he did not move I would kill him and then call the police. He moved and I left. As I left he said ""if you leave, we aren't going to speak for a very long time"". 

That is the last time I have heard his  voice.

He sent me a text a few months later claiming he has ""*too much glib for his own good*"". WHAT THE FUCK?! fuck that. 

**But this part takes the cake**. In March 2011, my grandpa (dad's dad) was in the hospital on a ventilator. He was going to be taken off the next day so we all went to say our goodbyes. Death is really hard on me so I went last. Right as I was talking to my favorite gramps, I look up and see Jesse. He was just standing there, staring me down. His legs were spread in a power-stance with his hands on his hips. He was leering and grinning and destroying me with his eyes all at the same time. My stomach dropped and my legs went numb. I didn't know what to do but I wasn't about to make a scene in my grandfather's final moments. I kissed my grandpa and said goodbye and left. 

I will never NEVER forgive him for that. I can't forgive myself. He stole my last chance to tell my grandpa I loved him. I completely forgot because of the shock of seeing Jesse. I lost 7 family members in the past 3 years and this death is the only one I really cannot get over. I think about my grandpa weekly and I think of the ordeal with Jesse multiple times a day. I have tried to tell my parents about this but they jsut don't seem to understand. They show they care, but they never do anything about it. 

Am I over-reacting? I feel like shit all the time since that November. I can't trust any guys and I just hate myself. Thanks for reading all this if you did.

TL;DR My dad's best friend is a molester (probably a rapist if he got the chance) but didn't get the chance to get me. But I feel very violated and cannot get over it two years later.

Their dad is just slowly earning back visitation. He's a criminal - abuse and sexual abuse. Alford plea. Terrible thing, that.  I will likely gain custody.  Hopefully. I'm scared I won't be as good a dad as she is a mom. 

I'm just venting I'm sorry. 

Edit 9/14: she is as or about as stable as last few days. Yesterday we did a video deposition for help in custody. Today, I was granted shared custody with their father and a visitation/parenting plan put into place should she pass away. I made special mention to my concerns regarding logistics of funerals, etc. Her lawyer says this is a big good thing for me. So yay on that. I hope the kids are safe when with him, and if God forbid, they are not - I now have a legal leg to stand on. I'm scared still, crying a lot, but feel like I'm making her proud. She has said that I am, too. 

Edit 9/16: Her energy is so very low. When she gets full of phlegm, she asks for help. And I do. I worry if she passes she will be angry with me that I didn't ""push"" harder. I help her then hold her and cry and recite the Lord's Prayer. The Hail Mary prayer has always scared me because it mentions ""now and at the hour of our death""...

1367654864.0,45,self.MMFB,1do4jt,Raped by best friend. He was found guilty. Sentencing hearing happening soon. Everyone hates me.,47,2,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/1do4jt/raped_by_best_friend_he_was_found_guilty/,"Ok.

I was raped by my best (male) friend after talking with him about me being a lesbian. He admitted it to the police the next morning because he felt guilty. I saw his confession, and our stories matched almost word for word. He went to jail for a bit and was bailed out. Then he started telling everyone that it was mutual and that I falsely accused him. 

He also sexually assaulted my sister 3 years ago. None of us turned him in because he was young and we wanted to show him love and help him by being supportive. We all started talking openly about sex with him. Not in a graphic way, though. He was molested as a child and never seemed to understand sex and how it works within relationships. He was also raised in a conservative christian home where sex was taboo and not talked about. Viewing sex as taboo often caused him to feel guilt and shame (after doing sexual things with others). So, we talked with him about sexuality, love, biology, and how they often intertwine. We were young then, too, and thought that we could ""save"" him.

The sentencing hearing is in a week. All but 2 of our mutual friends have turned their backs on me. His family believes that I am intentionally lying to avoid admitting to a relationship with him. He even admitted at trial that he knew I was a lesbian, but thought I ""wanted it"". We had talked about fetishes before (not in detail - more like, 'What causes one thing to be a fetish and another not to be?') and my sister and I once mentioned that having someone show dominance over us was what we would probably consider our only fetish. We also talked about that with him in front of our SO's. It wasn't a secret conversation. Still, in the court room he said that I manipulated him into it.

Somehow people think that he is telling the truth. I understand why they do... I mean, they love him. I did, too. He was like a brother to me. He knew me better than most. I can't wrap my mind around the fact that he would create this lie. At first I thought, 'It's because he's afraid of facing prison.' So, we offered him plea bargains (each with no prison time- just house arrest) but he denied them. He kept telling everyone that I was a selfish and manipulative person.

All I wanted was for him to be forced to go through therapy (individual and family) and drug rehab (he has been overly sexual with quite a few women while high). I just wanted him to get help. I wanted to show him that not all women will take things like this quietly and roll over. I loved him too much to want him to go to prison. I still do. Maybe that's stupid of me, but I honestly believe prison will make him worse. Either send him away for his entire life, or don't send him at all. I wont get into my views on the prison system...


I just feel insane. I hate this. The betrayal is more than I can handle. I can't stop loving him. I want to, because it hurt so fucking bad, but he WAS a brother to me. He WAS my family. I feel physically ill thinking about all of this. I tried killing myself twice last year and failed both times (thankfully). I'm better now, but I still have so much guilt. I wonder if we were too open with him about sex. I regret not bringing his problems to light 3 years ago after he assaulted my sister. We all just loved him too much. But love wasn't enough. It was a hard lesson. I feel like the world is slowly crushing me. We're in a small town and I see his family and friends driving past me all the time. I want to scream. I want to punch the wall over and over. I want to turn back time. I believe I did the right thing, but I also can't help but hate myself for turning him in. He confessed, and he admitted it (which is the only reason he was found guilty in court), but it doesn't make it hurt any less.

I miss my best friend. The nostalgia is constantly breaking me a part. I have no friends anymore because he convinced them I lied. That's not an exaggeration. The only people I see are the girls from group therapy and my family. I feel like I didn't do enough to help him. And I'm confused... I can't seem to grasp what happened. It's been over a year, but it feels like only yesterday. The pain is overwhelming. All this time I spent loving him and trying to convince my prosecutor that he needed therapy, not prison. I pushed SO fucking hard for him, even after he hurt me... but then he just kept on ripping me a part. They always tell you to report things like this, but the trial process is hell. It's hell and they hate me and my best friend is convincing people I've never even met that I'm a liar and he's writing letters to the Governor about his innocence and his mother is bad mouthing me and I'll never get to hug his little sister again or eat dinner with his parents or sit in his back yard singing songs or drive through the back roads late at night talking about life and love and our place in all of this.

My older sister said ""you know what you did so stop faking the amnesia"" but I told her there are a ton of cases like this with ambien but she's too stubborn or ignorant to listen.  She blames me for making things harder on mom but I had no control over this.  My mom said if I apologize to everyone that will smooth things over.  So I did.  I apologized but I still got the cold shoulder from my siblings the whole time I was there.  My mom was the only one on my side (being a nurse she knew this happens with ambien) but she was so grief stricken she spent most of the time isolated in her bedroom.  I was all alone with no one to console me.  I had to stay until we got my dad's ashes and that seemed to take forever.  We scattered them where he wanted them to be, but there's no headstone or anything else, it is as if he didn't want to leave any trace that he even existed. 

Two days after my arrival my fiancee took our dog to the vet because she was alive but couldn't move.  Turns out she had a brain tumor pushing on her motor functions and at her age (16) she probably wouldn't survive the surgery, even a younger dog wouldn't.  She had to be put down so I was dealing with 2 losses.  He couldn't afford her cremation because he paid for my flight because we are pretty much broke.  His uncle felt so bad that he paid for her cremation.

Now we have no money between the two of us and my alternator just broke.  It costs more than we have.  Now I feel like I've lost everything.  I can't get rides to work, or to my doctor (which I really need right now).  I'm just so overwhelmed with grief and selfish self pity that I can barely stand it.

I knew from the start that she was sick and only getting worse. Her condition was by no means fatal, but improvement always seemed impossible. As far as the level of passion, it is fairy tale. The tragedy in this all would make for quite the tearjerker film.

She is very religious, and I am atheist. She is in pain every day. Sometimes when she blacks out, she swears that she sees heaven. It's painless and peaceful, and when she is near blackout, I often hear about the meadow that she needs to get to.

She doesn't want to live a life of constant crippling pain, but she has for me. For an entire year. She made it to a year, which by this point is a feat in itself. However this milestone is bittersweet because while it is hopefully just one of many years of love, it looks like one of many years of horrible pain for her.

The pain is enough to make her want to give up and just wait for me in heaven. The only reason she keeps fighting is because I ask her to. I am, in a sense, responsible for her pain because I ask her to live through it. That kills me inside every moment that I have to see and feel her pain. If we had never fallen in love, leaving this earth wouldn't have been so difficult for her. She could finally escape the pain without too much trouble and fear. Instead I give her a reason to stay, which might sound great to someone else, but really is quite horrible when one has to see the pain every single day. I gave her a reason to fear death.

What do I do, Reddit? Do I let her escape the pain because I love her, or do I ask her to keep fighting so that perhaps she can one day be cured so we can live our life together?

There was no ""rape"", it was about ""fun"" and I ALWAYS made sure she was having fun. As weird as it sounds.

I was raped by my mother a LOT. So much so, that I honestly it was normal. I have decided not to marry and have had my tubes cut....

I have had a LOT of sex as a 20-30yr old with 18-20yr olds, and as a YOUNG 20 year old, I always found myself hanging out with 14-18 year olds with major daddy issues....

Which led to a LOT of awesome underage sex, and none of them are upset with me....but I know it was wrong...

I mean, she was GENUINELY concerned about my orgasms, as I was her (probably fake) ones.

We were both raped by my mom and her brother. If you've ever watched kiddie pr0n, you have probably seen us.

Is this a one time thing? Or do some women see this as a ""nice"" act by a brother in a similar situation?

I never penetrated her...it was always....I dunno, ""soft"" play? I would come while watching her play with herself, or she might give me that awkward handjob while smiling and waiting so we could go out and swim...

Fuck...Someone? I need to talk to someone....

I know where to get kiddie porn, and I've actually found three videos (from the 70s) of us....

Which made me come buckets....which messed me up...jerking off to me being raped by my mom and her brother...

I just want to chat with someone. I've had YEARS of therapy, but have never gotten the nerve up to tell her that it turns me on....

I have to confront her tonight.,43,5,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/10h1gs/my_wife_cheated_on_me_i_have_to_confront_her/,"So, as the title says, I've gradually discovered evidence of an affair that is at least starting (I don't know if it's progressed to sexual contact yet or not). It started with her trying to make me jealous about a guy at our kids' school who was flirting with her. She became very distant about two weeks ago, started going out randomly and with very vague information on where she was headed. So after a little bit of text-message snooping, I discovered that she was with him. 

We haven't had the best of relationships recently. She complains that I don't make enough to support the family (even though I work two jobs and make over 75K). She's started babysitting a few days a week, but claims that it's making her have a nervous breakdown and that she's growing to despise me for making her do it. 

So now I have to go home, have the most difficult conversation of my life, and find out what happens next. I love her and would do anything to repair the relationship, but I won't sit still if this relationship is going to continue. She has already involved our kids in this. She took the older two to a company picnic with the douche on Sunday, while telling me it was a party the kids were invited to. When I asked the kids later whose party it was, they looked scared and didn't know how to answer. Also, my three year old told me randomly - ""Daddy, I don't like mommy's friend Mark""

So I guess I could just use a little support. I'm weak, and can barely keep food down. My head is spinning and I can't concentrate at work. And I don't know what to say, knowing that I need to be mature, but also knowing that she has a verbally volatile tendency and is doing her best to avoid me just now. 

I also need the strength to not go cut the guys brakes, or at the very least let the PTA know that their treasurer is a home-wrecker. 

Thanks for listening...

EDIT: Thanks for the continued support. I've been tired and frustrated and confused, and it's hard to put it all into words. I'm not entirely sure where things stand. It seems that things haven't gone quite as far as I worried, although it's still on a bad track. I can't trust her right now, and she moves back and forth between wanting to work it out, and giving me shit. She was abused heavily as a kid, so I understand where some of her issues come from. But it doesn't excuse all of the issues she's showing recently. 

Lately, I've come to realize that everything that she complains about me, is something she's guilty of. She's one of the most selfish people I know, and my general reaction is to just give in to make her happy, or take her pain onto myself.

I don't know what I want. But it's killing me. I've been so depressed and isolated. I want friends badly - she's basically separated me from having friends, while at the same time giving me grief about being isolated. I want to enjoy life again and not feel like I'm in this marriage as a piggy bank and a punching bag. I want to feel good about myself again - the way I look, the way I feel, who I am. I want to have intimacy. Not just sex (although I miss that terribly), but conversation, love, etc. I'm not sure what my next step is. She can't leave, and she knows it. Her quality of life would diminish greatly. So she continues taking advantage of me, knowing that I won't be the first to end it. 

I've been told by my therapist that I need to focus on making me happy, and being content with myself again. That is easy on some days. On others, the anxiety and depression get the best of me, and I fret.

We got her meds and mixed it with gravy to make it easier for her to swallow, but after a few months of daily medication, I could tell that she just wasn't acting the same anymore.
Then one night, sitting in the window awning, she jumped down into the  backyard and disappeared for two days.  I had just started a new job and was having a very hard time coping with the thought of her being gone, wondering where she could be, and worried without her meds, but just as I was leaving for my first day, she walked right into the kitchen as if she had never been gone.  I swear it was like seeing my dead father walk through the door.  I held her and cried like I never have before, then I took pictures of the two of us, hoping she would never leave again.  
Something wasn't right though, she was not acting the same, staying in on spot the entire day and only moving when there was food presented.After another two days full of love and sadness, she disappeared again, this time for good.

We met in October 2009 and started dating in November of that year. We moved in together in May 2010 and by July I got pregnant. This was our first child. When she was about 4 months we got married. 

As soon as he came home from work today I got everything ready to make dinner for him. I try to start a conversation with him, he's not very responsive just says he's tried but he's got a look and tone of annoyance. I told him whatever his problem was he shouldn't take it out on me, especially since I'm making dinner for him. (This is a huge problem for us since he always complains that I don't cook for him). He replies he doesn't care because it's not like he can't go buy his own food. So tell him he should do just that and put everything away. He continues to say to me ""make me food."" And I'm just thinking ""all you have to do is apologize and I'll make your damn food."" Well no such thing happened, instead he took all of his things, EVERYTHING, and left. 

I dropped out of HighSchool and got my GED because he didn't want me to go to school. I lost my friends because he doesn't like them. I've done so many things for him and it seems like he doesn't care. I feel like this was a stupid reason for leaving. and I think he was just looking for an excuse to leave me. This Saturday he also got a bit annoyed with me for no reason in front of his sisters just because we were deciding where to go out and I kept looking at him (I wanted to go out, he didn't) and he's like ""what are you looking at?"" Everyone got quiet and it was so fucking awkward. 

Our daughter is about to turn 1 year old next month and we were planning her birthday party, we had already bought her, her clothes and I made the invitations and decorated the envelopes and he didn't care. 

I kept asking him why he was doing this and he just kept saying ""I have nothing to say to you."" I can't think of a single thing that he has done to go out of his way for me. Since I've been with him I've dedicated myself entirely to him and I feel really bad not having him here. 

My worries is not only that he left me. But before I met him I had planned to finish hs and move back to Mexico to go to college and live the rest of my life there. Well I'm still here, in the US, I can't get a job, I don't have a drivers license, or anything. He's going to help me with our baby (expenses) but what am I supposed to do let my mom pay my bills? I can't even get a job at fucking McDonalds because they do e-verify. My only option is to move back to my country with my daughter. He can go see her whenever he wants. however in NC we can't get divorced untill we've been separated for a year. And I have no money for a lawyer, I don't work and he never gave me money he just bought me what I needed. 

I wanted to be with him the rest of my life. But if this is what it took for him to leave, I guess I can't force love.

I talked to a friend about this earlier tonight, but I still feel like I haven't processed it all.  Hopefully this post will help.

Anyway, I've been dating someone for a long time now. We have an odd romantic history.  Known each other for a few years, but long distance wasn't working out.  Some months ago, I moved to his city and we've (at least that's what I thought) started things up again.  I was really happy.

About a month ago, I messaged him asking what his plans for New Year's Eve were.  He never responded or acknowledged my message, which was weird.  I let the idea of spending it together drop when he left town for work - he was vague about when he'd get to return.

Here's where it gets serendipitous and *really* weird.  I decided to try and find something to do on my own then for NYE.  Being new in town, I started to look through meetups.  Seeing my interest on some of the comments for meetup pages, someone e-mailed me out of the blue about this ""awesome"" New Year's bash being held.  Turns out... it's my SO's party.  His name, e-mail address, and home.  And through talking to this person and clicking through comment pages, I found out that he has a whole set of friends that I didn't know about who don't know who I am... or that he has been dating someone.  The party is going to involve dropping E with cuddle rooms that he seemed excited about.

I'm feeling pretty numb right now.  Am I overreacting by being really sad about this?  It's just... ouch.  And it was very awkward speaking to his friend who didn't know who I was.  I thanked him for the link and left it at that.  I messaged my SO about it, but I'm really afraid? Hurt? Confused?  I don't know. I don't know how I feel, just that it's bad and I'd like to feel better.  I know that how bad this probably is will hit me like a truck probably tomorrow.  Or maybe it's not that bad?  Right now I feel like I'm stuck in that awful moment right before a car accident when you're thinking ""Oh shit.""

1366054819.0,38,self.MMFB,1ceqdw,"F*** it, I'm airing everything out (Wall [of China] of text)",41,3,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/1ceqdw/f_it_im_airing_everything_out_wall_of_china_of/,"Every since I was young I've lived in poverty.

As a child I would stare up at the stars through the window where I slept on an air mattress with my two other siblings and wish to be one of those kids who had food in the house and who got new toys and was allowed to have friends over. I was an awkward kid and my parents couldn't afford new clothes or braces so I was made fun of so much that the kids developed songs to sing while they chased me home and threw rocks at me.

Then as an adolescent the abuse really started to set in. My parents had always been good parents until circa 2006 when my mom went back to meth. It was a secret, obviously, I didn't know of it until a few years ago. My parents started fighting and when my dad went to bed, my mom (being all tweeked out) would stay up for hours, banging on our doors and accusing us of stealing and doing drugs.

I met a man at my Mom's work who flirted with me and made me feel beautiful despite never even being kissed. At 14, I lost my virginity to a 31 year old man. We would meet for four hours every other Saturday when I was allowed to leave the house and have sex in dirty hotel rooms. I was completely in love and willing to do anything for him. My parents found out after my cell phone bill was $300 over the normal price. I was forbidden to see him and he told me outright that he planned on returning to a wife and son I knew nothing about.

After that whole fiasco, my home life became unbearable; I was not allowed any privacy, any means to contact the outside world (except when I was at school but everyone knew about my 31 year old boyfriend and I was an outcast. When I was 15 years old, I dropped out of high school and ran away to the closest major city. I met a boy who cared for me and let me live with him. I love him desperately and he abused me physically and emotionally, cheated on me, and made me sleep in the car when he was mad because I had no where else to go.

Sometimes I'd look up at the stars from the backseat and wish that I had enough money to eat. I would get so hungry that I wouldn't be hungry and I wasted away to a very low weight. This went on until I was 18 and after catching him fucking another girl in the bathroom at a party, I left.

But we still lived together and it was easier to do that. When I found another boyfriend, I dated him in secret for a few months before my ex confronted me and said that I needed to leave for ""cheating"" and ""going behind his back"". I told him to go fuck himself because I was paying rent but he retorted that I had never paid rent. I told him I had proof and that I would go to the landlord but I learned that he had been taking my cash and saying it was his and telling my landlord that I was delinquent on my payments.

So I moved out and went to live on a friend's couch while dating the new guy. I got a retail job but could never make ends meet and my boyfriend didn't work -at all- nor made any attempt to. I had to quit my job move up to my grandmother's house to avoid living on the street and he went with me. That was great for a little bit; my dad put money down for a down payment on a car and I was working full time.

Then that boyfriend broke up with me to leave one of my so-called ""friends"" and my bipolar set in -hard-. I couldn't breathe, I would go through panic attacks, I tried raping my ex when he was over (although I wouldn't call it rape because he ended up on top), I tried to kill myself at least 4 times. I still have the gashes where I cut down to the bone on my thigh. My grandmother died, leaving me her house and my Dad (who was separated from my Mom) lived in the master bedroom while I had a whole room to myself.

It was alright for a bit, I was trying to work through it but things started to get... weird. I started hearing voice, seeing things, having vivid dreams that I was a fairy-tale princess who was protected by dragons and my ex bf was a silly fairy prince. I started hearing the voices of things I thought were fairies or spirits but sometimes they would be dark and tell me to hurt myself.

Then came Toby (name has been changed). Toby changed my life forever. Toby was everything you'd ever want in a man: Tall, handsome, patient, hung, stable, intelligent, funny, and as devoted to me as I was to him. He believed in my silly fairytale so much that he 'discovered' his own 'character'. We lived in my grandmother's house, my Dad loved him, and everything was perfect up until Thanksgiving. My dad moved back in with my mom and they were trying to fix it; my mom had started taking prescription pills for pain and would hand them out to my brother and I like candy. We'd been fighting a lot lately, mostly over money. I had a part time job but it only afforded me enough money to pay my car payment and cell phone bill. He had to buy food, pay rent, etc etc and though he made good money, he was fed up. I'd also ballooned out to 200 lbs from the 120 I was when he had met me. It's not like I hadn't been looking for a job, it was the end of 2008 and I wasn't aware of the world outside my own.

Near Christmas he told me that he was planning to move closer to work so that our relationship could grow and heal. I bought that hook-line and sinker and watched him grow happier and happier as he got all settled in. I wanted to be happy for him but suddenly he wasn't returning my calls and he just didn't care anymore. In January, I took a few Vicodin and felt brave enough to break up with him. So I did.

And then everything fell apart. The bipolar sent me into a hole that I had no hope of every crawling out of. I tried to kill myself several times in that empty house and my parents begged me to come home to be safe. I relinquished my ownership of my grandmother's house to my father and moved home. It was... okay... I would try half-assedly to find a job while my mom fed me pills and tried to help me back on my feet. Toby and I were kind of keeping touch and definitely still having sex.

I took a job as an exotic dancer after seeing pictures from a friend on FB of her being one and it looked so amazing. Suddenly I was losing weight and Toby was interested. He was impressed with how independent I was. It was the first time that I'd been completely financially independent and could buy whatever I wanted. I moved back into the city into my own place, eating any pill that was given to me, and clinging to Toby desperately. I needed him. We weren't together but we still had sex. He wanted his freedom to pursue other girls but when he couldn't find them, he would 'settle' for me. This went on for a year. We would text all day, I would beg to see him, try to seduce him via text, act confident and independent, and when he called my bluff I would spiral down into a panicked depression. When we were together I was never allowed to talk about my feelings -that pushed him away-, if I wanted any time with him at all, I had to fight to and then act perfect when he was around so he'd want to hang out with me again after that.

The economy started taking its toll on the clubs, I was spending most of my money trying to appear stable to Toby and buying pills but I knew I was going to lose it so I started selling my body. I lived alone so I would find men at the clubs and invite them back to my place to make some extra money. I always used protection (the times I can remember anyways) but I was sleeping with Toby AND doing all this. One guy blackmailed me into sleeping with him for free and letting him do whatever he wanted. For a month straight I lived in constant fear that Toby would find out or that this guy would report me. I let him rape me whenever he called and acted like nothing was going on around Toby. Things were nightmarish. I had been in a depressive state for well over a year; I would cry for hours, alone in my apartment, face down on the carpet and cutting all over my body. I wanted so badly to die. One day I decided I was going to end it. I looked online and purchased what I thought was cyanide. When it arrived, I told Toby and turned off my phone. To my surprise he showed up at my apartment and demanded that I go to an emergency room. I was starting to get a really bad tummy ache and I didn't want to pay for an ambulance so he drove me there. On the way I vomited all over his car and he missed his opportunity to go to Disneyland with a girl I didn't know he was seeing. He stayed me as long as he could; he watched them shove hoses down my nose and my mouth, my legs were shaking so violently and uncontrollably that I had to be physically restrained. They pumped my stomach and found that I had not been sold cyanide, that it had been something else (can't remember the name). A few hours later I was transferred to a behavioral clinic for 5150 but I talked my way out of it and was out the next day. They gave me Zoloft to start getting my bipolar taken care of and at first it actually worked! Everything felt like it was going to be okay. For my birthday Toby and I went to Vegas together. That week was amazing and I found out a few weeks after that that I was pregnant.

I was stoked. I wanted so badly to have something to keep him around and now I would have him for the rest of my life! He was so good to me, buying me food I was craving, rubbing my feet, being a sweetheart and holding me as I fell asleep... I talked for hours about the baby name and how we would raise it and assumed that he agreed but a week later he told me it wasn't a good time in his life, or mine, that I should try to get my bipolar figured out and to be more stable. He promised me that if I had an abortion that A) we would freeze his sperm and try again in a few years and B) that he would start treating me better and get back with me.

In my state, Planned Parenthood is require to show someone getting an abortion the sonogram of the baby. I started bawling when I found out it was twins. I'd always had dreams about having twin babies. I though my dreams were coming true. I cancelled the appointment and was so excited to tell him! Needless to say that he was not as excited. He convinced me that it would be really easy to have twins again with his frozen sperm so I hesitantly said goodbye to the lives growing inside me and went through with the abortion.

Toby was wonderful during the aftercare. I felt so loved. It was the last time I would ever feel that way.

An exact week later he stopped talking to me. I didn't get it. He'd moved into an apartment in my complex so I sat outside his door and cried and begged and banged until he came out. He said he was disgusted with me and that the friend who had gotten me into stripping had told him all my dirty secrets. The drugs, the prostitution, the lies. He said that he was waiting on test results from an STD check up and that he was writing me off. I hit rock bottom. God I was... Destroyed. My parents once again begged me to come home so that they could care for me and keep an eye out. I obliged, happy to have a change in scenery and told Toby I was moving.

When I was finally all moved in, starting to feel a bit better because I felt safe, I called Toby. We ended up arguing on the phone and he hung up on me, leading me to text him over and over again. I tried calling some more and finally a female picked up.

I thought I had called the wrong number but she informed me that she was his fiance and that I should really consider overdosing and just ending my pathetic life. I panicked and hung up. Then I hopped into my car and drove two hours to his apartment. On the way there he finally gave up and texted: ""Fine, come on over and we'll talk."" I showed up about 30 minutes later and knocked on the door. I expected to see him but instead she opened the door and started berating me. I could see him sitting on the couch with her dog in his lap, just allowing her to say hurtful things. She used every dirty little thing that Toby had told her about me, twisting the words into me while he watched and ignored my pleas. I'll never forget how it felt...

I don't remember much... but I ended up back at home with my parents in a fucking pile of tears. My mother subdued me with an assortment of pills and I slept for a few days. When I woke up, I felt an emptiness I'd never felt before. I knew that I was done. That it was time to go. While my parents were out and my little sister downstairs watching tv, I stole a bottle of tequila, all of my mom's pills and my exacto knives (My parents had hid them from me), climbed into the big, warm tub, and slashed my left wrist down to the bone. I remember pulling the tendon aside to keep cutting just in case I survived because it would have ruined my ability to use my left hand.

Apparently I passed out because when I woke up I was in the hospital, drunk as hell, and watching my wrist get stitched with 37 stitches. By law they had to 5150 me (I was on my 11th 5150 in my life) and it was there that something changed.

Someone actually listened to me. They told me it was okay to hurt, and to not be perfect, she taught me to accept myself and from that day on I wanted to succeed. When I got out of the hospital, the world seemed brighter, seemed more alive. As I healed, the medication started to really take effect and I was headed into a manic phase. For about 6 months I was on top of the world. I learned how to skateboard, started smoking weed, quit the pills AND cigarettes, got in touch with old high school friends and even got to date a boy that didn't even know I existed in high school. Everything was wonderful.

Until he broke up with me and I was spiraling down again. I told him I was pregnant even though I wasn't, I threatened to commit suicide and then felt obligated to so no one would think I was just doing it for attention. I got up to 17 5150s, ended up in jail twice for petty theft (mania makes you think you're invisible, that you can do anything), and started taking pills again. I found out that Toby had, legitimately married the new girl a a month or so previously and I secretly hated them both for it. This went on for a few months and then I started to come back up. I struggled to get stabilized but I didn't have a solid foundation to do so. In October of that year my drug addict brother stole my car and totaled it. It wasn't even paid off yet but it now sits on my credit as a charge off. He never once tried to fix it but he was not to be trusted. He'd fucked over everyone in my family multiple times.

One night after feeling particularly suicidal, I disappeared back to the city to spend the night with the ex that I had originally moved down to the city to be with. We were very much like siblings so it wasn't weird or anything. The next morning I got a text from my dad saying to never come back, that my mother had found all her pills and some jewelry and a few hundred dollars in my room. I denied it because I didn't have any of those things. My mom had set me up. To this day I have no idea why but when I got home, my room was in shambles; even my teddy bear had been pulled apart to search inside his stuffing.

I immediately called everyone I knew to get the fuck out of there. My very good friend's family invited me in but they live an hour and a half away. I decided to ditch everything, move in, and start my life again. I enrolled in community college, spent healthy time with the mom and sisters. It was like a real family but their dad had a temper and although he never EVER hit anyone, it made me really uncomfortable. They must have felt the same way because they informed me that they couldn't keep me there anymore.

Again I am panicking to find a place to live. I have no where to go. My ex got in contact with me randomly and asked if I wanted to spend the night again. I said yes and that night we talked about me living on his couch til I found a place. I was ecstatic. I moved the three boxes of my stuff I still had left over down to the city and hit the best manic phase I've ever been through. I was smoking weed a lot, expanding my mind, teaching myself ASL, skateboarding in the beautiful summer weather, and generally loving being free from emotional pain and my parents and my life.

I couldn't find a job though. I had only a skateboard to get around and a rapidly declining amount of money for public transportation and food. The money dwindled down until I had nothing. Once again I was wondering where my next meal would come from and that's scary shit. I lucked out one day and got an interview for an office job. The boss was incredibly understanding and took me in like a daughter; he bought me gifts, helped pay for things, gave me a full time job, was fulling accepting of my bipolar and never ONCE tried to come on to me. Life was going good. I got a puppy, started biking to work and getting in shape, I had a few flings here and there and while the breakups still sucked, they were slowly but surely becoming less dramatic. I still lived in poverty but it was okay because the city was beautiful and I was hitting mania straight on.

I spent a lot of time deciding who I wanted to be. I dissected who I was and altered any parts I wasn't happy with. I would find parts I didn't like and just phase them out. I liked myself. I was proud of how far I'd come, how much I'd matured, how feel I was from Toby's control over my heart. My brother asked to visit one weekend and after hearing his pathetic tale I invited him to live with me to try and put his life back together, like I had. I fed him, bought him clothes, smoked him out, didn't charge him rent and even found him a job. We were putting our family back together and making in work in a way that my parents had not done.

Last October I got back in touch with a boy I'd been in love with for many years but that had never been single until now. I thought it was meant to be -obviously because I had waited for him- but I instinctively knew that he wasn't over his ex and when he finally broke it off for that very reason, I went crazy.

October, November, December, January, February, March... 6 months or depression. I gained weight, stopped working out, could barely get out of bed... I felt useless. I hadn't had a real relationship since Toby and I was starting to believe that I would always be single but half of me wanted that. I was terrified of ever loving someone again because of Toby. I had thought that this new guy was the one. I don't know why, I just knew, I was in tune with the spiritual world around me.

But I was wrong. And that disappointment sent me straight back into a 5150. At that point I had missed so much work that my boss had to let me go in January. I didn't care about anything. I was empty. I didn't shower regularly, I didn't hang out with friends. Half way through March I set the goal to throw a birthday party to celebrate how far I'd come. My depression made it damn near impossible to to get anything done but I dropped all my saving into this party, I wanted to really celebrate and show my appreciation to all my friends.

Then suddenly I caught my brother with pills and coke. He'd been taking the money he was supposed to give me for rent and buying drugs. We had a knock-down drag out and I told him to get out. He then proceeded to tell everyone at his work that I had kicked him out for no reason. I found out that he had been using my car and acquire THREE parking tickets that were all overdue and in the hundreds. He'd been stealing cash from a private safe I had under the bed so I couldn't cover the rent that he owed me. He worked at the dispensary I bought from and convinced his boss to cut me off and cancel my membership.

Then I discovered bed bugs. I spent an entire paycheck hiring an exterminator. So much, in fact, that I couldn't afford a bed and now, again, I sleep on an air mattress.

The day of my birthday, I woke up alone, cried, baked for my big party and got high. A group of us went to set up the venue and I was SO excited. I left the rest of the stuff to people who were already dressed and ready to go and headed home to get all pretty for my birthday. Naturally it took forever but I felt beautiful. I was so happy and proud of myself. I imagined how dreamy my ball would be and when I got there....

Only the people who had helped put the party together were there.

60 people had RSVP'd and 3 of them actually showed up. I faked being happy and grateful all night because I didn't want to be rude to my guests but that night, for the first time in years, I cut.

And now we're here and I'm 15 days away from being homeless. Again. I have a car I can sleep out of but I don't qualify for unemployment since it was under the table. I am on food stamps now. I have $3 to my name and no opportunity for work. Not that it would matter. I'd work for a few months and then the bipolar would destroy me and I'd lose my job. That's just how my life works. I tried for disability but they view mania as a period of stability so it looks like I'm just sad when bad things happen and then I'm fine the rest of the time. It's an awful cycle.

I just want to be normal like everyone else. I want to be stable, to have a job that can work around my disability, to have a steady enough paycheck so that I don't have to worry about making rent. I want to go to school and do something my parents will be proud of but I'm stuck in poverty. Whenever I make any extra money I magically end up with a bill that takes it all.

I gained so much weight that none of my bras fit and they trap them painfully during the day because I can't afford to buy new ones. I've had to steal basics like deodorant, shampoo, soap, etc etc. I sleep on an air mattress with a slow leak and up until recently I was sharing a tiny bedroom with my brother. My car is falling apart; every time I turn her on I pray that the engine will start...

It gets me down that I live in poverty. I've tried so hard to grow and be a normal person but I have no control over this bipolar. I am at the mercy of my emotions and the voices of my tormentors in my head. I don't know what to do. I don't have any money to move, no hope for a stable job.

I guess if you're still reading, I'm going to kill myself. It's apparent that this life doesn't want me to succeed. I'm not meant to be here. I'm tired and have felt empty and different since Toby. Not a day goes by that I don't think about suicide and I'm tired of the consuming thoughts. I'm ready. I have no fear. I only dream of peace. What a sweet sigh of relief it will be. Just like falling asleep.

I think about suicide often, but luckily I haven't completely bottomed out yet. I'm afraid that it will happen one day.",42,5,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/16tuvn/im_a_student_veteran_and_i_feel_extremely/,"I'm 25 and a veteran of Operation Iraqi Freedom. I wasn't there when it was really crazy or anything, but I did experience things that most people never will. It's even tougher because I'm in college and I have no way to relate to anyone. I have people to hang out with, but I don't feel that life has an substance to it. Everyone drinks and parties, which I enjoy doing, but it's all empty. After Iraq, I just don't think that my life will ever be as exciting as it was there. I don't think I'll ever be integrated successfully back into society. I've been diagnosed with PTSD and was on some anti-depressant meds for awhile, I got off because I don't like the idea of being tied to a pill for my mental health. I was seeing a counselor at my school which helped, but since we've been on break I haven't seen her since the school has been closed. 

I haven't been depressed lately but last night was a tipping point. I went out with my roommate who plays baseball for the college and his baseball friends. I don't have any friends of my own in this town. To make matters worse, being around this group makes me feel like I'm weird and inferior, because that's how it was in high school. I don't think I should feel this way, I'm fucking 25 years old and a combat veteran, but I'm marginalized in every conversation. 

To top it off, at the end of the night I got a ride home with a girl that I kind of know, and her friends. I wasn't remotely interested in any of them, all though they were attractive enough. Everything they said was benign and trivial. One of the girls insulted my age and called me weird for not being like everyone else. Normally I value my weirdness, but lately I've been feeling more isolated than ever. I guess it was like a Gump kind of moment.

Anyways, I was watching Louis CK today, and an episode about him doing a USO tour came on. I started crying. I was already upset about last night, but then seeing everyone in uniform makes me upset that I still have friends in Afghanistan and here I am in my boxers eating a fucking hot pocket. It makes me feel beyond worthless.

I don't know if I would qualify myself as suicidal as of this moment, it comes and goes. I used to own a pistol but I sold it at the request of my counselor, which is one of the best decisions I ever made. That used to be the worst temptation for me. I knew that all it would take is one squeeze and I'd be gone. I'm sure if it came down to it, I could find other methods, but I'm trying to keep myself positive. Typing all this out has actually helped.

I hate feeling alone. The sad part is I do it to myself a lot. I have a supportive family and friends who don't live in town that I can call anytime. I guess just not having anyone similar to hang out with in my town makes things worse, and with all of the additional issues I have with PTSD, making new friends that are 7 years younger than me is not easy.

1353164365.0,39,self.MMFB,13cpci,Dad Unexpectedly Died,43,4,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/13cpci/dad_unexpectedly_died/,"It's been about a month since my dad died unexpectedly at the age of 56.  My parents were vacationing out on the west coast (We're from Indiana) celebrating their 30th wedding anniversary.  They were having a blast just talking and planning out the next 30 years together.

They were driving along in Oregon when he just died of a heart attack.  My mom had to get down on the floor of the car to somehow stop the car.  I seriously have no idea how she survived since they swerved from the right lane, to the median and back over to the side of the road.  They both were not hurt and they didn't hit any other cars.  I'm so thankful that somebody was watching over that car cause I don't think I'd be functioning if I lost both parents.  Or if I knew we caused pain for any other family.

My older brother and I got the call at 6 pm on a Friday.  We were preparing to leave town to go to a wedding.  That weekend was basically suppose to be a little vacation and really fun.  Instead we flew out to Oregon to get our Mom.  She was all alone for almost 24 hours since we have no family out there.  I just feel so awful for my mom cause they loved each other so much.  I had a boring, safe childhood, and I was always loved.  I knew they would fight, but they got through everything.  They started and ended each day with a kiss and ""I love you.""  They set very high standards for what I expect in relationships.

We got Mom home and started planning the funeral and viewing.  It seemed, and still does to an extent, like an awful dream.  Like, I'll be sitting at home and he'll walk in like always.  My family and close friends have been great, but a little overbearing.  It was always the 4 of us.  I'm not particularly close with extended family, but I always knew I had my Mom, Dad and brother to help me.  So them asking what they can do to help, and we tell them serious things like ""Blow leaves"" or ""Mow the grass"", and they just laugh at us, hurts a little.  I didn't need yet another thing of chili.

The viewing seemed so weird.  My dad was in the trucking industry so quite a few people came to it that we've never met in real life.  Or if we have, it's been over 10 years.  My brother and I keep making sure Mom was okay.  We had an unspoken agreement that one of us would be with her at all times.  I was staying back at our house since I moved out 2 weeks before their trip.  That was the last thing we did together as a family.  I was plotting what to get my brother and Dad since they moved all my belongings in the rain.  I owed them yet again.

The funeral was even harder.  My parents are Catholics (converted a couple years ago so I am not) so we had a mass.  It was so weird.  Mom chose to sit in the middle of us kid instead of the end of the pew next to Dad.  I could barely look the my right because I was next to him.  I half expected him to sit up and ask why everybody is crying.  Father did a wonderful service.  Made it very accessible to us non Catholics.  Explained the symbolism of his actions at the end.  He also incorporated talking about Dad's habits (Same church pew, golfing, etc).

The church had a luncheon afterwards because we chose to bury Dad in his hometown instead of the one I grew up in.  The luncheon was really great.  Got to talk to my step grandma about Dad and Grandpa.  It took us forever to get in contact with her.  Dad was her favorite of his siblings (don't tell them that though) so we knew we had to find her.  I was the one that broke the bad news sadly.  She's a postal worker so I called her post office and left a message.  Common sense just tells you that when you are hearing from me instead of Dad in regards to him, it's bad.  But she drove 5 hours to get to the viewing and funeral.  My best friend from high school drove 2 hours to be with me.  The luncheon was a nice break in one of the saddest days of my short life.

The burial was next.  I don't know how we got through it honestly.  It was a short ceremony, but bitterly cold and rainy.  All the stereotypes I hate about burials happened, of course.  After the deacon was done, Mom couldn't leave.  All my family members kept badgering her to leave and she just couldn't stand up and leave Dad.  I stayed by her side and played defense as best as I could.  I understood completely.  She just needed time before she could leave her soulmate behind to be buried.  So I stayed next to her holding her hand until she found the strength to stand up and leave.

And then life had to continue on.  My brother, couple of friends, and I stopped at Dad's favorite Coney stand and had bakes in honor of him.  We then headed back to my brother's house to have a party.  We already had it planned before everything happened and we knew Dad would want us to have it.  So we turned it into a festive wake.  We only used Dad approved shot glasses (favorite sports teams, places, etc).  It was great.  Kept my brother and I busy and distracted for that night.  Our friends turned up in force and made sure we had a good time.

Real world beckoned us to return.  My brother worked with my dad in the business they ran together.  So he's running that now all by himself.  I come into help on my day off.  Mom always did the books so she still does that.  I think it'll survive.  Dad built it and so we are keeping it alive.  I had to returned to my job that Tuesday.  Everybody kept mentioning that Dad bragged about my job.  I just graduated from college and this is my first real job.  Everybody knew about it.  He was so proud of me.  He always always bragging about what job interviews I was going on and how I graduated college unlike most of my family.  

It just seems so unfair.  Why him?  Why now?  I feel so selfish for thinking of things he's going to miss out on.  Like, giving me away at my wedding.  Our father-daughter dance.  Grandchildren.  Life in general.  He was always there for us 3.  Always.  Did whatever we needed him to do and more.  But now, he's not.  So I'm also angry at him for not taking better care of himself.  I'm scared for our future.  He was my safety net for learning how to do things in the real world.  If I ever stumbled, I knew he'd be there and catch me.  Now I don't have that net. 

I want to make him proud.  I want to hear his voice again.  I want to have one more hug from him.  I'm trying not get buried in regrets, but it's hard.  Life is just hard.

If you made it this far, congratulations.  You now know more about me than most people I know in real life.  My father was a wonderful man and I'll miss him everyday of my life.  So now, I ask for just a couple of things.  Advice for getting through holiday season.  Advice for getting through life in general.  Finally, funny stories, links, images.  He was always making me laugh, so I have to continue to do so.  MMFB please.",,False,,t5_2sjdn,False,,,True,t3_13cpci,http://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/13cpci/dad_unexpectedly_died/,

I don't have a lot of friends here, most of my close friends left during the early stages of sequestration, before furlough set in.  I'm the only person leaving during furlough (which ends at the end of the fiscal year, September), so I'm going to be the only employee in our entire 12 year history of this department to leave with absolutely nothing.

I was really looking forward to that picture and matting.  I'm never working in government again, so it was going to be my personal memento of ""I did this, I worked here.""  And now I will have nothing.  I'm a contractor too, so my last day is a Friday which is a furlough day.  So my last day will be spent entirely alone as the rest of the office is civilian employed.

But I oversee our project budget, and we *just* sent them a check for about 6K.  It's unallocated, open money.  And they can't spring the $10 (max) to buy the matting and print the picture?  And the farewell parties were donation based, never from DoD money.  But they're not going to have a good-bye for me at all.  It makes me feel worthless and like no one cared about me here.

Things had been doing poorly for a while, she just seemed totally uninterested and just generally didnt care. She never supported me emotionally and always asked for more and more. She complained about the relationship and sex and everything but made no effort to make things better.

For the past 3 weeks or so she has been talking to her co worker too frequently. Well, I always told her I was uncomfortable with it but nothing changed. She would text him constantly even while we were together. I feel like she was emotionally (if not physically) cheating on me.

She wants to bring this guy in liue of me.

visited me constantly after surgeries, Made me feel beautiful when I was bald, and was my rock for the whole relationship. He was my first love.

I go to a small private high school so we dont have all of the ""staple"" events that the average high school has. For example, we dont have homecoming dances because we dont have a football team. We also lack a few other major events, but i cant think of them at the moment. So anyways, because of the lack of events at our school, a lot of students at my school go to the events at other schools. And once they make a connection with someone from that school, they get invited to their personal house parties too. But i just get so frustrated by that, because no matter how many friends i have at this school, i never get invited to the big parties. And at my own school i actually am very well-liked, and i do have a few friends at other schools, but they arent the ones that throw the parties. I used to not care, but now i just feel so alienated. But then some people actually threw a BIG community-wide, teen-only party that i was actually invited to! But i kept getting so anxious about it, and everyone was going just to grind and hook-up with girls, and i was really afraid. So i didnt go. And whats worse is that i punished myself for my bad decision and kept reliving it like a nightmare in my head. But then i realized that the real reason that i was turned off by the hooking up and grinding (and on some level for all the other parties that i wasnt even invited to) was because i think im gay and i hate it. Ive always had a kind of attraction towards guys, but i never paid any attention to it (basically tried to ignore it). But now ever since ive been introduced to masturbation and pornography (as most boys my age that i know do), my same-sex attraction has been more pronounced. Im only ever attracted to gay porn and i fantasize about sexual encounters with my guy friends. So now im even more anxious and scared because i dont know anyone who is gay and im worried that it will alienate me even more by the friends i have. There's really a lot more to this story, and the problems im having now, but ive never been able to get advice about this topic, and i want to keep this post focused on it. And ive already typed out so much! So please, i really need some advice in any form, or if you can recommend a better subreddit to post this to. And if you have a question or need more info, instead of downvoting, you can just ask and ill answer. thank you!

And one more point is that i can't help thinking that what social things that my friends do is the ""right"" thing to do. I wish that parties wasn't what kids are ""supposed"" to do. I wish i could tell my friends how i feel, because then they probably would invite me to things and be supportive (at least some of them). I wish i could grow up and have good experiences and be proud of them. And most of all, i wish i could accept the fact that im gay, and that there would be people that i would fit in with, and truly feel like a strong part of something good.

I am also scared for my cats.,41,5,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/xem3k/21_year_old_alcoholic_here_im_poor_and_scared_i/,"Hi Reddit. I thought about doing an AMA, but figured my sadness belonged here. 


Here's a little bit about me, starting from when times got rough. My dad died when I was 11. Heart attack at 39. He was a  great guy, a nurse in the cancer ward of a children's hospital his entire career.


I discovered my mom was an alcoholic when I was 14. That's when her abuse started. Usually not physical (only got  physical if I shouted back at her). She frequently told me I was the worst mistake she ever made and I wasn't worth the  air I breathe. I had to hide from her. She worked at a newspaper company until she got laid off about a year before I ran  away. The job had late hours, she usually got home around 1am and would then pound an entire bottle of cheap vodka  straight out of the bottle. I would frequently find her laying on floors, covered in vomit, naked. She would have sex  loudly with strange men when I was home. She was a monster and I hate her.


(Cool story before I continue: when I was 19 I was contacted and told she was put into treatment. I went and got all of her things worth saving [the house was actually condemned and moved her into my apartment building, gave her $3,000 which she blew in a month, I paid her rent for 3 months, then she moved in with me [she still had no job] started drinking, fucked some shit up, moved in with an old dude and since then I have cut off contact with her.)


This abuse continued until I dropped out of highschool at 16 and ran away at 17 to Minneapolis from the small town we  were living in. I had saved up $300 from the burger-slinging job I had been working at. It was going to be my first  month's rent money living with a girl I knew from highschool named Kelly. The dude Kelly was fucking found it and stole  it. Since he was a scary gangster I was unable to confront him about it.


Fast forward a little bit, and thanks to help from friends, things are going okay in Minneapolis. I have a job at a nice  diner and I'm making friends. Things are definitely okay.


I feel like I should mention here I was severely anorexic from ages 15-18. Then I put on like 45 pounds. At that point I  was still getting periods, though.


So after a while Minneapolis just got to expensive. I didn't want to see my friends anymore or do anything fun or even  leave the house to get groceries because I was so ashamed of my weight. I was at 145lb and I'm only 5' tall. So I became  a hermit. I couldn't look people in the eye when I worked. I decided to move to Des Moines where it would be cheaper,  effectively cutting off all of my friends.
 

Once in Des Moines, I got a job as a lunch lady at a highschool for $10 an hour, but the hours sucked. Only about  25/week. I became severely anorexic again (I would not eat for days and when I would it would be like half a piece of  bread), lost ALL the weight I had gained, got REALLY happy (seriously I love being skinny) and met my boyfriend there (he  was 17 I was 19. Not THAT creepy) and quit. 


I then got a job at a coffee shop. Things are going okay. I am happy. I love my new boyfriend, he's pretty cool. He  doesn't work, though.


In the beginning, this was not a problem. He was living with his mom so I didn't have to feed him. And I didn't feed  myself. Being anorexic is very nice on a budget. 


Eventually I got promoted to manager at the coffee shop. Nice pay increase, it paid like $22,000 a year. I am still  anorexic at this point and I have stopped having periods (but again, couldn't be happier). Things are good, except at  work. The job is hellaciously stressful. I was working 72 hour weeks. I got no overtime or support from the DM's. I  stayed at that job for over a year, but I decide to cut my losses and go work at target. Things are still okay, but  financially a little shakey. My boyfriend is still not living with me.


Then in walks the biggest sociopath douchebag on the fucking planet. He was a regular at my coffee shop and he manages  the concert venue just down the street from my store. His assistant just quit. He asks me to come work for him. I'm  fucking stoked! It's going to be so awesome! He's such a nice guy!! Wrong. So fucking wrong.


In the beginning it was great. Goin to work at 9:30 and getting off at 5 everyday! Just answer the phones, send out  emails, file stuff, sell tickets...easy! Sure I have to stay late if there is a concert, but whatevs. I get to watch TV  and drink beer. :)


Well, that's how it started. Seriously, I think the manager went insane. He started nit-picking all of the things we were  all doing wrong and going off on these lengthy lectures about how he can't be the only one that pulls his weight around  here (all he did was sit on the phone all day and play video games most of the time. I am not shitting you). This is the  conversation I had recently with his assistant after me on facebook (who quit after a month):

funny story to tell you

I'm listenin


--July 10 (assistant)
he has to find a new assistant, though he doesnt know that yet, dont have any shows so they want to lay me off with no  unemployment for two months while c____ sells tickets for the 2 shows we do have even mikes gonna be laid off


--July 10 (me)
Holy shit. Ain't that place fucking stressful? I hate C____ so goddamn much.
And they're losing MIKE!? Oh man. That building is going to close the fuck down because the giant fatass is such a  sociopath dictator. He thinks he's the god of the V______, that he's the smartest person alive, and everyone else is a  worthless dumbass that doesn't pull their weight.


--July 10 (me)
Anything going to happen with the bar? Chad still good?


--July 10 (assistant)
AGREEED TO EVERYTHING
i think mikes just laid off for a little while but chad is good for now, who knows theyve laid him off before
im already doing interviews for a new job though
kinda funny that c____ is gonna do box office so he has to answer the phone and cant leave
im not training a new person hell have to


--July 10 (me)
He's lucky me and Chelsea put together ""the bible"" (also, I hate how C____ is always like ""Don't fucking ask me  questions, it's in the bible"" when it isn't), that'll make training a little easier.


Good. Get the fuck out of there. C____ sucks the life out of the people around him. I love my new job, I wouldn't ever go  back to the V____. 


And that is funny. I like picturing how frustrated he'll get and thinking ""god, now he finally knows how all his fucking  assistants felt.""


2 years (or maybe 3, but I think 2) as manager and he's gone through like 5 fucking assistants. How can he not think he's  part of the problem?

____________________________________

So now you can kinda tell where stuff started to go downhill. I became a raging depressed alcoholic from being around  that asshole all the time. I put on 20 pounds.Then 
that stupid fatass cuts my pay down to $9/hr! 


I realize I need to get the fuck out of there before it kills me. So I apply at a new coffee shop (the last one closed  down a month after I quit. The place fucking FELL APART WITHOUT ME) and BOOM get hired! Woohoo!


Now we're pretty close to the present. I got hired about 2 months ago (actually my first day was May 31st). So far things  have been...a little better...but the money is running out. I started writing bad checks to get food when my account was  overdrawn. Now I'm getting a bunch of collection letters and the major grocery stores all have me on their ""bad check  list"" (their system won't take my checks... I didn't even know that could happen...). We are constantly out of food. All  I can think about is getting drunk to ease the pressure on my chest, the wrenching in my heart from anxiety, the  depression and the hopelessness...


My boyfriend can't find a job (he lives with me btw, started right about when I got a job at the concert venue) because  he has no experience. We fight. I hate my body. I spend every day with him and I can't imagine losing him but sometimes I  just want him to go away. But I do love him and he takes care of me when I get too drunk (all the time). He is very  tender and considerate, I have never met such a sensitive guy. Sometimes I feel bad that he's with me, but I've taken  good care of him. I bought him fun things when times were good... 


The end of my story is this: They only scheduled me ONE DAY THIS WEEK. ONE FUCKING DAY! 7.5 hours! I don't know what I am  going to do. I am so scared. Someone please help me.

But when I do, nobody cares.",39,3,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/uca7c/i_dont_always_have_interesting_things_to_say_but/,"I don't usually tell people my problems.. I was raised to think that no matter what issues I had in life, whoever I told them to had it worse and didn't care. So I kept my mouth shut. It's cost me relationships, friendships, a bond with my mother and father, and it's left me feeling cold and apathetic. 

Just the other day, I couldn't take a whole lot of bottling shit up, so I just vented a short paragraph of my crappy day to a friend.. To which she replied ""Yeah.. I don't want to think about my ex.""

It took me back a minute, but then it hit me. People really don't care about my problems.. Even when the rare moment occurs to which I wish to share them. Not even my best friend really realized that for once, something was wrong with me.. I understand that she is going through a hard time with her ex, but I've spent hours listening to her.. Letting her cry on my shoulder. Trying to console her through her pain. When she needed me, I drove 30 miles to be with her for as long as she needed. 

So, why am I so easily shaken off? Why is it so easy for people to ignore me when I actually want to talk to them? It just reiterated the psalm that has been beaten into my head as a child. I've even been told by multiple people that it is no way to go through life, you have to talk about your problems, etc etc. But when it comes down to the very few times I feel like spilling the beans, it just confirms my beliefs. Nobody cares, unless it's about them.

This really breaks my heart and makes me want to withdraw further, which is unfortunate because I'm in the process of getting to know my new boyfriend and trying to open up to him. I've also listened to him the few times he's spiraled into an emotional night, but I don't really know if he would ever listen to me, either. Not that it's a huge problem because the pro's outweigh the con's when it comes to him.

But I'm going through a very hard time right now, and I'm realizing that not only do my friends not want to listen to me, but I don't have any to begin with.

This doesn't make sense.. I'm an outgoing, happy person. I'm very active, love to party, I'm very nice.. Maybe overly nice sometimes. I'm talented, interesting. I'm not mopey and I have a lot to offer. Why am I so alone?

I can't talk to my mother about the way I feel, because it's her who has installed this thought process in my head that your problems will go away, you just have to tough it out and not be whiney. My dad is in jail for literally being a ridiculous person.. He's not a criminal, he's just so ridiculous that a serious of events have landed him in jail. (He's actually there on his own will.)

My brother is autistic.. Good luck getting him to listen to me.

So, I'm here. Venting to strangers who probably care less than my careless friends do. 

The worse part? I even want to brag sometimes.. Through all this shit I'm going through, I have so much good going on. My friends don't even want to hear about THAT. I would much rather be venting about how well I am doing with tattooing, how awesome my new boyfriend is. I went cliff jumping for the first time this weekend. I went 60-70mph on a QUAD and it was my first time even riding one (I wasn't driving, of course.) The morels are popping up around my house and I LOVE to cook with them.. Doesn't anybody want to hear about how good mushrooms that grow behind my shed are? FUCK.

So, it's not that I'm an unpleasant person.. I have plenty of good to talk about as well as bad. But it seems like nobody wants to hear either. I just want somebody to listen to me. Maybe even ask how my day was and actually WANT to know as opposed to using it as a filler.. 

Well, If you read this, thank you for listening. Feel free to ask me any questions, it would be appreciated to know somebody takes a small amount of interest in what I have to say.

No problem, says Bob (my therapist), I can help you beat this without drugs, but it'll be harder.

He wasn't joking. The past four months have more or less been hell. I wasn't sleeping. I wasn't going out and doing anything - I spent nearly all my time at work, or school, or in my apartment. I was missing classes and missing shifts and not always even being able to call in for the latter. I managed to keep my part-time job and keep my head afloat in a single class, but it wasn't easy, it wasn't pretty, and not all aspects of my life went so well. I wasn't taking care of myself - the apartment I was more or less sharing with my girlfriend was filthy, our relationship was going downhill fast, and my normally hyperactive sex drive was more or less nonexistent.

The relationship is worth more discussion, because my girlfriend (our one-year anniversary came about a month before I started therapy) was, for a long time, the only thing holding me together. I'd come home from a shitty day, and she'd cuddle me and make it less shitty. Not better - nobody could have done that - but less shitty. It wasn't a healthy relationship for a long time, though. I wasn't capable of doing my part in ANY way, because the depression was just screwing me up that badly. Every single ounce of energy I had was going towards trying to get my head on straight and trying not to have my life utterly collapse out from under me while I did so, and there wasn't any left for her.

I wasn't dating a complete pushover, and she didn't like that, and we fought a lot, but we weren't communicating well (one of us was depressed) and so the fights weren't often on topic. We were also both very reluctant to break up with the other, me because I was basically using her as a lifeline (and yes, I feel guilty about that) and her because of past problems that aren't my story to tell. So things kept going downhill, because it was an unhealthy relationship and it wasn't ending. Finally, things came to a head last week. She cheated on me with a friend of hers.

Since I'm a terrible storyteller, I'm going to add an aside about how therapy worked for me here. Basically, the psychologist I've been seeing (who I found through Psychology Today's listings, in case anyone needs help finding one, and who was open to helping me regardless of financial situation, though my parents gave me some help there) is what's known as a cognitive behavioral therapist. I told him all about what was happening and how I was feeling, and he would ask me about how I was thinking. Once he had a good picture of my mental processes, we talked a lot about how many of them were not only inaccurate but self-defeating, and how I wasn't thinking about life in a wholly realistic way. He gave me a lot of help replacing those with more realistic, positive, and healthy ones, and those processes slowly got better, but it took time, and even once I'd made significant improvement there things weren't really getting better in terms of how I felt emotionally. It got to the point where even though I wasn't comfortable going on meds, I was seriously contemplating it because I was sick of feeling bad and wanted to do something about it.

Anyway, so my girlfriend cheated on me, six days ago, and thankfully called me directly afterwards to tell me about it. Then the weirdest thing happened. I felt hurt, sure, and I felt REALLY disappointed in her, because she's better than that. But it didn't crush me. It didn't make me feel horrible. I was able to keep functioning, even though I felt really hollow inside and frankly not very great at all. I told her I was breaking up with her but that I didn't hate her or want her to feel horrible, hung up the phone, and went to talk to a few friends about it online.

The rest of that day...was rough. I had a ton of stress in my life already, but thankfully no school or class that day. I ended up going over to my mom's house to help her with something, and I ended up briefly in tears a couple of times. But I got through it, I went home at the end of the day and I got a good night's sleep. I woke up the next morning feeling better, but still rough, so I called in to work sick (feeling bad about that, of course, mainly because I've done it so much thanks to the depression) and stayed home.

That day was better, though. I started feeling a little better. I realized consciously how unhealthy our relationship had been, and that I was honestly a little glad to be out of it. That made me feel a little guilty, but I'd made a lot of progress in therapy, and I kept telling myself that feeling guilty over how I felt was unproductive, that wallowing in guilt wasn't solving anything, and that the best thing I could do was just accept things for the way they were and move on in a healthy fashion. And the strangest thing is that it actually worked. Not just in terms of convincing myself that that was the case - for a while, I'd been getting that far, but it wouldn't make me feel better, and then I'd feel even worse that it wasn't working. It actually improved my emotional state. I did a bit of cleaning, I got back in touch with some friends I hadn't talked to in way too long. I made a profile on OKCupid, because I realized that I wanted to meet new people and I was told by people I trust that that was legitimately a good way to do that for the socially-adept-but-currently-withdrawn.

The next day, Sunday, I woke up feeling all right. Not good - I hadn't woken up feeling good, or had a day that I felt good for the majority of, in months - but neutral, which is nice enough when you're used to feeling like shit all day. And that stayed with me all day. I did a bit more cleaning. I made some plans with friends and with strangers online. I stayed in control of my thoughts, and managed to delete some compromising photos of my girlfriend and myself from my phone without feeling awful or collapsing or contemplating doing anything less than completely honorable. The last, thankfully, is par for the course, but the first two are completely unprecedented in recent history.

Then monday came. I woke up early - which never happens - and the strangest thing was that I woke up feeling GOOD. Actively optimistic, happy to greet the day, looking forward to class (there's this cute girl...) and even to work to some extent. And by the time I was on the way to class, I realized something. A redditor I know, who was depressed and on medication, had described the day he started taking meds as waking up and going ""oh hey, this is how OTHER people see the world!"" Monday was that turnaround day for me.

Since then, things have kept going well. I'm feeling actively good about myself, and I have been consistently throughout. I'm staying in control of my thoughts and emotions when bad things happen and looking on the bright side. I'm keeping up with all my responsibilities. I have an active social calendar planned - this weekend is going to be crazy in the best way. My therapist thinks I've made legitimate progress that's core to who I am as a person and is talking in terms of seeing me less often unless things turn back around. And the part that made me want to post here is, it hit me more or less out of nowhere. Therapy helps, guys, and I heartily recommend it. I've heard that drugs help, but they weren't for me, and I now have proof that that's okay. But the most important thing is, if you can't see a light at the end of the tunnel, don't get discouraged, because a week ago, I was feeling shitty and didn't see myself feeling better any time soon. Today, I'm feeling awesome and a trained professional thinks I'm likely to stay that way for the foreseeable future.

Feel free to ask me anything, or share stories, or whatever you like. While I'm here, I'd like to thank a very special redditor, mbingo, who provided me with help in the form of pizza and being an incredibly fucking kind human being on two separate occasions while things were bad. To those of you who are here to help out others, not get help, you really are that awesome. It is impossible to overstate how much a random act of pure kindness and generosity can help someone in a bad spot get through the day. I love you all.

Thanks for reading.

EDIT: Holy crap, this got long. TL;DR: Bad stuff has been happening, but therapy helped, and so I'm dealing with it constructively, and doing that has turned my emotional life around and has more or less cured my depression, or at least the way it used to cripple me.",,False,,t5_2sjdn,True,,,True,t3_n53um,http://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/n53um/im_finally_beating_my_depression_maybe_i_can_myfb/,

I don't know how she knew, she just knew. My mom talked to Nancy and her family about what happened. It was obvious that something happened between my dad and Nancy, but anytime my mom would try to talk to Nancy about whether or not the baby was in fact my dad's, she wouldn't answer and would just start sobbing. Nancy's brother claimed that he had caught her and my dad together once. Basically, there was a lot of evidence piling up against my dad. I learned that my grandfather was actually in the same situation when he was younger, and his family paid the girl and her family to pretend like nothing ever happened. We're pretty sure that my dad and his side of the family did the same thing... They paid my babysitter to pretend nothing ever happened. She refused to have an abortion, so she gave birth to a baby girl, and gave her up for adoption. It really bothers me to know that I have a half sister out there somewhere.

Here's the thing. I am a highly intelligent woman, with a Master's degree, a sense of humor, and a kickass body. I love nerdy shit, and I am very open minded. I rock it in the sack. I am kinky as fuck, but I am also a goddamn great girlfriend. Or at least I would be. Because I am not demanding. I am kind. I am considerate. My ideal date is at home watching movies and a home cooked dinner. I split everything 50/50. I don't expect crazy gestures or expensive gifts. I am faithful and loyal. I have never cheated. I have a great job in public service. I am giving, good, and game. I am still young at 26.

So fuck me that I keep being stupid somehow and end up wasting my time with these motherfuckers that don't appreciate how awesome I am and how awesome I find them. It's not like I fake that I am cool with just fucking around. Nope, I learned a long time ago to be very honest in relationships and dating. I am upfront that a) I ideally want a relationship and b) that relationship would be monogamous and c) I'd like to date to find out if we'd work in a relationship and take things slow and d) if you're not cool with that, we can be friends. No pressure.

And yet the past 3, count 3, guys that I have spent a considerable amount of time, effort, money, and heartache on have been in the same pattern. Where I am upfront about my needs. They seem cool with it, say they want the same things, and then we start taking things slow. Then, of course, they end up getting frustrated that we're not fucking. I'm considerate but adamant about what's right for me. They turn around and say I love you, I care about you, I want to be exclusive. Let's make this work! Me, being fucking stupid me, doesn't want to be jaded and let the past dictate how I treat this new awesome person, and so I agree and rejoice. So we date. We become exclusive. We have great sex. And then he turns around and says fuck, this was too fast, I just want to be friends IMMEDIATELY after sex. And then he fesses up and says he just said he wanted a relationship because he wanted to get fucked. And then when I am reasonably and understandably upset about you lying or not being adult enough to know what you want and respect the needs and desires of other people ahead of getting your dick wet, you whine and whine about how you ""don't like being made to feel worse than I already do.""

Fuck. You. All.

I apologize to all of the mature men out there that are ok with a woman wanting to be friends first and respects that she's looking for a relationship down the line. I hope that I find one of you, that we date and form a good friendship, and became great partners. I'd like that. I wish that I hadn't lost so much of my trust in your gender. It's not fair to you.

After a few slightly cryptic messages it became clear that she had been raped. I'm not an overly emotional or angry person but that news shattered me. I continued to talk to her while going in to work only to arrive, turn on my heel and go back home.

Whats worse is her big fear is that this will change things between us and all I want to do tell her how much it wont, how everything will be the same but I know it isnt, and then I hate myself because I'm punishing this person I love further for something she had no control over. 

I have experienced certain things before in my life that upset me to varying degrees but none of them come close to this. I really wish she was home where I can look after her (as much as she would get angry at the thought that she needed it).

Please MMFB...",37,4,52,http://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/htxxf/due_to_some_physical_defectsmedical_conditions_i/,"(This is going to be kind of TMI. Sorry)

Long story short...I have a plethora of birth defects/conditions which has resulted in me having pretty messed up genitalia. I have never told anyone this (besides my parents, some extended family and obviously my doctor). I would rather not get too into this, but let's just say that it's very noticeable and there's really no way to act as if things aren't messed up. I have never been naked around anyone else. I don't really like being naked by myself, to be honest. It's kind of difficult. This also results in me being sterile. There is an absolute 0% chance of me being able to father a child. My body also doesn't naturally produce enough testosterone, so I have to inject hormones into my thigh every other week and will have to do this for the rest of my life. I could have surgeries done to help correct things, but there is nothing which can make it all normal, so to speak. And anyway, said surgeries aren't covered by insurance and are very expensive. I don't know when I could afford them, but I'm guessing it wouldn't be for 5 to 7 years at the minimum (student loans and all that fun stuff).

I haven't ever really had that much of a sex drive, probably due to the fact that I really hate my body, but lately it's practically skyrocketed. It is driving me up the fucking wall. Couple this with the fact that I am for whatever reason seen by women as attractive (and not just isolated incidents, but several drawn out cases), and I'm not doing too well. It is so frustrating to know that these situations are presenting themselves to me, but that there's nothing I can do. It upsets me to know that I can never have the same relationship with sex as most people can. I can't ever relate to any of that stuff, and it makes me feel like an outcast - not only from my peers, but from Western society as a whole!

I have never even kissed a girl because I am so self-conscious and anxious about how things are. There have been plenty of opportunities for that and for much more, but I have never taken advantage of them. It is endlessly frustrating to see my friends having relationships and being sexually active. I am also going to college in the fall, where I'm guessing that sex will be even more present. It is just endlessly frustrating to me. I really want to eventually be in a relationship and to be a father. I have known that things aren't going to be easy for me for quite a while, but that doesn't make it all easier, I guess.

So, yeah...I feel really messed up. Thanks to anyone who took the time to read this.

I’ve always been that guy that people initially dislike or think is weird. The ones that stick around or are forced to be near me usually become my friends or generally like me and then after a period of time they get pushed away. I’ve never had a long term relationship, friend or anything more. 

My longest relationships currently have been with people I have never even met in real life but speak to on the internet. I’ve known them for about four years now and I’ll be flying out to meet them for the first time in a few days. My time speaking to them has been filled with some doubt whether to keep in contact but they seem genuinely excited to be finally meeting me. I can’t help but be skeptical that I’m not the person they think I am. I’ve easily known people for longer who have eventually gotten sick of me.

After finishing university just over two weeks ago I’ve started to notice the typical human behavior I’ve experienced for my entire life. Ending secondary school I didn’t really get on properly with a lot of my friends and by the end of it I was the typically victimized person of my closest friend circle. Being gay never really helped in an overly masculine group and I would be constantly picked on for it, not that I ever admitted it to them or even to myself until a later on, which they sent me abuse for and eventually forced me to delete them from Facebook cutting off the last weak ties we had. Cutting off contact was easy when I didn’t like them but after university I’ve found it harder.

People don’t contact me. I don’t get messages asking how I am or what I’m doing or what I’ve been up to anymore. When I contact them they seem happy to oblige and share engaging discussions and stories but never the other way round. People just don’t give a shit enough. It isn’t the fact that no one contacts me, some do, but only the people that I don’t want to contact back or enjoy talking to for one reason or another. I’m a pretty shit person. I tell people this but they don’t believe me, until they realize. 

So what are my flaws? What eventually leads these people on to think I’m a decent valuable friend and then eventually decide to abandon me:

- When I get comfortable and honest with my friends I become very negative and realistic because I am. I won’t sugar coat things or just be nice for the sake of it because that’s not really the person I am. When I’m done impressing them and trying to get them to like me I slack off and then they start to realize what a mistake they have made.

- I have this horrible mix or arrogance, confidence and a not the best but a not bad understanding of life. I can persuade arguments to fall my way sometimes and can either be very compromising or not at all. Due to the nature of trying to impress and be nice to casual acquaintances and then being more honest with people who I think are my closer friends means that they grow to like and then to hate me.

- I catch people out when they are wrong and will confront people. Sometimes I can be funny, other times cruel and sometimes just plain brutal. People have said they have to be careful what they say around me. I enjoy playing devils advocate and trying to exhaust the possibility that they could be wrong before believing something. That’s sort of how my brain works and to people it can be seen as condescending, intense or arrogant when I don’t think of it in a threatening way but that’s just the awful way I process information. It comes across as distrustful because I am a distrustful person. I’m always happy to change my mind but I feel that I have to be persuaded.


- I’m not a consistent person. An  ex-friend once said I can be the either the loudest person in a room enjoying being the center of attention or the quietist not really wanting to talk to anyone. I have depressive selfish tendencies which means I can get worked up easily over little things and find myself fighting with myself to control them. If someone irritates me, even if they are a close friend, I won’t say anything to them until being a bit of a dick for a while. I convince myself I actually hate them until the red mist disappears and I eventually come to a realization. By then it’s a lot of the time too little too late.

Being back home now after university no one messages me to go out. I live too far away for anyone to bother with and the one friend that does live near me I don’t enjoy going out with. His friends are pretentious and to a point so is he. People don’t see it but when I’ve been in need he’s been happy to fuck me off. I’ve also been the person asking him if he wants to hang-out at times and was pretty persistently ditched. I’m more than willing to return the favor now, however I can’t ditch him to hangout with anyone else because there isn’t anyone else in my life.

All the friends I made at university have other groups of friends they can hangout and talk to. Not me, I know it might be selfish to be jealous but to see them hanging out with people and having fun when I have to spend my time sat indoors isolated from everything makes me more than depressed. For the first time I heard about a night out people went on that I wasn’t told directly about and I’m pretty sure it won’t be the last. I am slowly fading out of their lives like I have with everyone else I’ve ever known.

In September I move to another city for a new job and to meet new people. Some of my university friends have promised to meet up with me and hang out with me a lot but I doubt they will be able to follow through with that, partly cause of me being a shit person and partly because they will always have other friends that are a better alternate than hanging around with me. Another cycle, a new group, another facade of getting people to like because I’m that pathetic I can’t help it and then eventually getting bored or them getting to know me too well to the point where they dislike me.

Trying to break this cycle feels like the curse of my life and I’m not sure if it will ever truly end. Being a self pitying dick is the worst kind of person and for that reason keeping hold of friends seems like a pointless task that I am doomed to fail. I don’t really know if I will ever be really happy. Drugs and constant substance abuse kept me sane through uni but with a clear head I only realize how fucked I truly am. The good times still outweigh the bad and I will go on in my life making enemies. It’s interesting to see my Facebook profile constantly slowly depleting and is a constant reminder of what I am.

People never know this about me until knowing me for a long time. I don’t give up this information right away because people would just go running. I can’t tell the people that say they are my friends now because I have no idea what they would think of me and it would just confirm their thoughts. 

I am a shit person and life for me isn’t easy but I can just about make it bearable for periods of time. Hopefully that won’t end but I fear eventually it will. No one can make this right, I feel like I am just doomed to this existence.

I'm posting on reddit because I don't have people in real life to talk to about anything going on in my life. A lot of you guys have lost important people in your life, I haven't been that unlucky, and I do have friends, a mom, a dad, etc.
I have crippling social anxiety, which makes it impossible for me to try and talk to family members about anything and everything, I also have depression, and have since I was 14 years old, I will be 21 this April.

I'm a virgin, never held hands with a boy, kissed a boy, nothing. I think this is all in relation to just social anxiety, and how I look. I'm 6'1, overweight, and suffer from PCOS (Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome), which causes me to grow hair on my face, chest, back, stomach, etc, and when I was 14 I started to shave it all off to try and look ""pretty"".
I have many dark scars because I scar easily, and I know its not attractive to men - long story short I've given up on ever finding someone because I understand why guys wouldn't want me. I've accepted that and it's okay.

I recently got my dreams crushed because after 3 years of planning to go abroad - my flight tickets went up in price and I can't afford the $350, after spending $400 on a visa I will not get money back for, and I am now jobless.

On top of all this, I have been having regular fights with my mother (who I still live with because I cannot seem to get a job that isn't something that only lasts three months,) and they have been starting to get physical and so emotionally abusive that my depression is back in full swing. 
The worst part is my friends think my mom's ""cool"", and say I'm overreacting because I'm just stressed out.

I want MMFB to be everything it has the potential to be. I have noticed that responses range from a simple ""get well soon"" type of response, to a dynamic and well thought-out explanation of advice for people and their troubles.

I just want to remind everyone that there isn't a right or wrong way to make people feel better (to a degree, it is wrong to say something that will blatantly hurt someone's feelings). You can take it figuratively and just say something that you think might brighten someone's day. Or, you can take it literally. You can really MAKE someone feel better by telling them what you think they might be doing wrong and how, in your opinion, they should go about fixing it.

I suggest to the people who do the latter to be very sensitive in their responses, but do not be discouraged from saying something to the OP that they might not really want to hear if you really do believe it will help them feel better. 

I believe, at first, I wanted this section to be a place to garner sympathy for problems, but over time I have really learned to respect responses to people that originally didn't want to hear their faults, but ended up being extremely grateful for the advice.

I have started advertising campaigns for MMFB. I’m not super-wealthy so I’ve just been using the cheaper self-serve ads, but I recently got into contact with the owners of the ad campaigns and /r/PimpMySubreddit and in a few weeks we should start seeing MMFB ads on the right-side ad spots. If anyone else would like to help out in any way (Making ad art, or wanting to do a self-serve ad) feel free to message me and I will get back to you ASAP.

She was called Sophie; I was young when I named her and I thought that the name suited her well. My dad rescued her from a shelter, so he said he found it really hard to sign the papers that allowed her to be put down. For the past few days I kinda knew she'd be gone soon - she had lost so much weight and stopped eating and drinking so we had to syringe feed her supplements. Even when you expect something like this, it never really prepares you for it.

She liked to jump onto my lap when I was doing homework or just on my laptop, and would always try to nibble on any crisps I had.

She only had one eye because she got an infection and had to have one removed. [Sometimes I'd put a googly eye on her because it made me giggle](http://i.imgur.com/fkccNOS.jpg).

She was nearly 15 years old and it turned out that she had a tumour on her liver and there wasn't anything that could be done. She's not in any pain now, which is a relief. 

I have two other cats that are about a year old, and Sophie taught them how to be cats I guess. We found the other two (along with three more) in our garden after a feral cat had given birth and then left. We kept two, I gave one to a friend who had one of her cats put down recently, and the other two went to a sanctuary that my step-mum's friend owned.  
One time Sophie killed a mouse and then left it for the kittens and they didn't know what to do with it. Now we get at least one dead thing brought into the house per week.

[She liked boxes](http://i.imgur.com/BAIvhYh.jpg) and [loved sleeping](http://i.imgur.com/16wtP3C.jpg). She longed for freedom [after having her eye out](http://i.imgur.com/HYowaRg.jpg), even though she never really left the garden.  
She was just a cat, but she was my cat and I loved her. She was there through my mum dying, my granddad dying, and numerous other pets passing away. 

She's buried in the same corner of the garden that another cat, Mog, and our Siberian Husky, Xena, are.

This is where you come in, reddit.

A few months ago I was in a relationship with an emotional cripple of a man. It only lasted for about five months. I usually like rough sex, and so did he, so I felt like we had a good thing going as far as sex goes. 

About a month into the relationship he started out a sexual encounter by slapping me HARD in the face. I usually enjoy slapping but this felt more like getting punched; my ears were ringing and my head hurt. I told him that was too hard and he eased up a little although not enough, he continued with the face slapping as he was violently pushing his dick down my throat.

At this point not a single cell in my body was aroused and I was really more scared than anything. I wanted it to stop but I figured the easiest thing to do was to just continue and hopefully it would be over soon. I know I could've said no, but didn't; a part of me was afraid that he wouldn't listen. It lasted for about ten minutes. Afterwards I headed straight for the shower and stood there crying for a long time; most of all out of shock. 

I know this wasn't at all rape, and I don't think he actually wanted to hurt me - he's just an emotionally disturbed person. I still *feel* like I've been violated though. And this makes me feel all the more stupid since I don't feel like I have the right to feel raped since it wasn't rape. 

Ugh. I just want someone to justify my feelings about this. I want to know whether I have a right to feel bad about this. It sounds idiotic but that's all I really want. 

**EDIT**: Thank you all for your replies, they really help. I just wanted to say that I'm fully aware that in the eyes of the law, this was not rape. I guess I'm trying to deal with letting myself *feel* raped even though I technically wasn't. I don't think he would've continued if I'd said no, but he didn't seem to care enough to check to see if I was still consenting either. 

Side note: he told me his ex had accused him of rape once. Not sure what to make of that.

I decide to hang out with J and get drunk. M comes to hang out too. I have one mixed drink (2 shots) a shot and a few sips of another drink. It was late and I lie down on the couch feeling a bit woozy. J starts touching me, sticking his fingers inside me and I tell him I can't do this, I don't want to, stop, M is in the next room and he's says M isn't there. During this I pass out.

I wake up, my bra's undone and I feel still drunk. I go to work for 10 hours, during which I figure out my underwear is on sideways, and I don't remember taking my pants off or putting it that way. During my shift I go to the washroom and my ass burns and I notice some blood on the toilet paper. I think  maybe it's spotting as I'm on the depo shot. Then I have to go again a few hours later and there's an intense burn and blood in the toilet. I'm worried I'm sick at this point.

When I realized that I'd been raped was when I had sex this morning with the guy I'm seeing. It kind of hurt when he went in and when we were done there was blood all over his dick and it wasn't period blood.

I have no memory of what happened later, but I asked J what happened as my bra was unhooked and he said he tried getting with me but I was passed out so he stopped and went to M's and smoked a joint.

My bed is big enough for two people to lay in, and we cuddled a little. I'm  bisexual and everybody knows this, but I lean much further to the male side of things. She took my hand and put it on her boob. I did not allow anything further than that to happen, and we both went to sleep. She later goes and tells our group of friends that while she was asleep, I took her bra and shirt off. Now she is a big girl, way bigger than I am. (And I am a male.) Some of them knew from the start she was a liar, and some were skeptical. I talked to a few of them and she is throwing in new things into the story as days go by from what I hear. 
I would be able to move on past this except I keep getting hurt by them. Initially a bunch of my friends blocked me from communicating with them. (Block skype and facebook etc. Fine. I can handle that.) 
Now pictures of things we've all done all summer are being removed from everyone's facebooks if they have my face is in there somewhere.. Every single friend. They would rather let a known manipulator be in their life rather than someone who has established himself as a friend you can count on to do something if needed. I've always been there for all of them and they have all finally turned against me. 

I basically have no friends now, I feel the stigma of the word molest when I never did anything that was claimed against me, and what makes me most sick to my stomach is friends of friends will be going to the same university as me, and I don't know if they are going to spread the lie even more.

My girlfriend of a year and a half was cheating on me for the last two months of our relationship. I wasn't told, but I found out and called her bluff. I kicked her ass to the curb for good. None of that in my life. Horseshit. Still hurts like a bitch though.

My ex before her, whom is still the gold standard to which I hold relationships, informed me that because I went ""No Contact"" to try and get over her and better be able to handle a friendship between us later, (Because I didn't want to hear about who was plowing her while I was trying to heal, and you know that's exactly what would happen), she never wants to speak to me again because I ""erased her from my life after three years.""

And then today, to capstone all of this, I come home to find out my cat, the only thing in the world that made life worth living when I was this down in the shits, had been put down while I was at work because her leukemia finally caught up. I HELD MY FUCKING FATHER WHILE HE SOBBED BECAUSE HE COULDN'T HANDLE IT. I'M 23 YEARS OLD. I'M BARELY A GODDAMN ADULT.

MMFB, I'm a recovering alcoholic. After my last big breakup (not the most recent), I developed an awful habit. I drank most of the day. I drained my savings. I pissed everything away because that's just what I did. And I stopped drinking when I met my ex. And after all the shit with her came to the forefront, I still didn't drink.

But this pushed me over the edge. In the past hour, I've burned through a pint of gin and two six packs. And I've already got two more cases of beer just waiting. I don't want to die. I just don't want to feel anymore. This month has destroyed me and every bit of hope I've ever held.

My IRL friends gave me about a week's span of listening before I was bombarded with their problems. I HAD FIVE GIRLS ADMIT TO ME THEY WERE CHEATING ON THEIR BOYFRIENDS RIGHT AFTER I FOUND OUT THAT MINE WAS. I've been relationship counselor, I've been doing everything to try and power through this, but I'm not strong enough, and my support system is bullshit.

Come in, get your hug on, tell me your problems, and let me carry some of the burden. My back is already broken, what's a little more weight to see someone else smile. God bless you all.

The only person I knew within 300 miles was my girlfriend, who had taken a job there a few months before my move.  Things were going pretty well here, I did well on my first exams, and seemed to be meeting a lot of new people.  I'm naturally a very friendly person, and a decent-looking guy to boot, so it was pretty easy.  The only downside was my excessively-pessimistic and downer roommate, who I was usually able to escape.

Now I find myself feeling very different about my situation.  I have somehow faded into the background, and it feels like I am a ghost.  I am largely ignored, despite my friendliness and efforts to get involved.   Nobody answers my calls or texts anymore, and anything I try to organize (fun or academic) sees very little interest.  The only people I can talk to are my girlfriend (who is always traveling for work), or my roommate, who will only make me feel worse about my situation.  I don't have many opportunities to make friends outside of school due to the time requirements of class and studying.  I'd like to move out and find a new roommate, but I have nobody to live with.  

Ultimately, I get the feeling that there's something wrong with me.  There's some new problem I have, but can't seem to figure out what it is.

This would be difficult for anyone, but given my very extroverted nature and need for social interaction, it is even worse.  I'm feeling especially bad right now, because tonight is my birthday.

Turned out to be the worst.,36,7,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/q5wh5/was_supposed_to_be_the_best_week_of_my_senior/,"Yep it's about a girl. A beautiful girl, extremely talented artist, the girl that keeps me up at night, the one that I think about before going to sleep, the one I see in my dreams and the the first person I think about when I wake up. She's extremely smart and unlike anyone else at my school. The only girl I could think about for the past year and a half.

I took 2 art classes this year, hoping she'd be in one of my classes. She wasn't in either of them at first, but she was transferred into my second period art class a week after school began. I really had no idea how to talk to girls and in the beginning of the year, I had to muster up all my courage just to say hi. We eventually started talking more and more. 

We were talking everyday and I would always walk with her down to her next class as we talked. I was always late to my class 3rd period, and I'd get scolded. I was okay with that, since spending just a few extra minutes with her was worth it to me. We would pass each other in the halls and she would always smile and wave. 

2 marking periods had rolled by and she was no longer in my art class. We talked more on Facebook, and after school, when I was working for extracurricular clubs, she'd stop by and say hi around 4:00. I'd stop what I was doing and we'd just talk and walk around the school until she left at 4:30 on the late bus. 

It was really really obvious that I liked her. My friend told me she liked me too and I should ask her out. So I finally did. It took me until February but I called her, told her I thought she was beautiful and asked her out. She said yea. I asked her if it was too awkward. She told me it made her happy. We ended up scheduling it a week and a half in advanced since she was busy, but we were going to go out President's day weekend on Sunday.  Valentines Day, I bought her roses and we talked some more. 

I could not have been happier. Here I was planning to go out with the girl of my dreams. Needless to say, I was excited.

Then came Saturday night.

She called me around 11:30 pm telling me she had to cancel. She said she was busy with the Cooper Union home test. I told her it was okay. I knew she really wanted to go to Cooper Union and she had a lot of work to do. It was okay. She sounded really sad so I decided I would try to cheer her up by dropping off flowers when I was supposed to pick her up. Little did I know Flower Shops aren't open on Sundays and I spent 2 hours driving to 3 different shops. I decided I would just head home at that point. We would reschedule after the weekend. I'd let her focus on her work and I'd call her back on Tuesday.

So I eventually did call her. I asked her if we could reschedule and everything went to shit. She responded with ""Sorry... I can't go out with you... because of [John]."" [John] was an old friend of mine and a college freshman. I was crushed. I told her I had a couple questions and continued by asking when they started going out. ""Valentines Day."" I had no idea how to respond at this point. It felt like my chest was imploding on itself and everything was being crammed inside. The only thing I could ask was if she ever liked me. ""Yes... but I've liked [John] for a long time and I like him more than you."" I haven't been able to stop thinking about those words for the past week.

I haven't seen her smile in about a week, and she avoids me while in school. She knows my schedule and knows how to not see me. We've passed each other once outside. She wouldn't look at me.

The past week I've forced my self to eat. Food just sits in my mouth and doesn't taste like anything. The process of sleeping has been painful. I still can't stop thinking about her.

Sorry for the long corny post. I just need a place to vent. I told myself I wouldn't get depressed. I've gone through that once and I told myself I would not let myself get that down ever again. It just hurts.

Nobody knows except a couple of close friends and I can't really talk about it.

I thought she felt the same way, she made eye contact almost all the time and her eyes went all fuzzy when she was near me, and she always seemed to act very nervous and scared around me.

But a couple of days ago I decided to ask her ""When you look at me, does it feel different to when you look at anyone else?"" There was a deathly pause and she looked really nervous and her eyes went all fuzzy, she stared at her feet and for a second I thought she was going to say yes. But after some fragmented rambling that I couldn't understand she started saying things like: ""I'm not... I'm not..."" and wouldn't finish her sentence when I asked.

And then, *finally*, she said no, but very vaguely.

The worst thing is that she looked so red and flustered afterwards and it's just making me want to believe that she does feel something but is in denial. I don't want to give myself false hope, today in school she just completely ignored me and acted like nothing happened. So even if she does feel the same way, there's nothing I can do :(

I feel so stupid and useless having wasted my time on this. It hurts like hell whenever I see her. It took a heck of a lot of motivation to ask, and when I did my heart was racing, I was shaking and I could feel blood rushing in my ears.

Please MMFB.",40,7,47,http://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/o1ohr/really_in_it_lost_everything_have_nothing_no/,"Hello, I just found this subreddit today. I'm on the east coast of America. Last spring I graduated from college and have yet to find a job. I have a specialized science degree, which I now feel stupid to have pursued as there is very little job market without getting further education, which I don't have the funds to do. After graduating I found out I can't go home and my boyfriend of two years at the time who had a job and place suddenly broke up with me because he was afraid of having to support me. Up until then we had both planned on me moving in with him and us getting a bigger place after I found a job. Well he freaked out, can't go to my parents -they don't have room and I am also not welcome, so I ended up crashing with friends. 

Slowly I burned through friends as I searched for jobs, eventually I ran out of friends and still no job, ended up staying with my brother at his place, on the floor of the extra room in September. Around this time my ex felt bad and got back in contact with me, and me feeling so low, let him back in. Shortly after I started staying with him sometimes but was careful as he made it clear that he didn't want me just moving in right away. After two weeks I got a job offer 3 hours away. I asked him what he though and he said I'd better take it, sounded like a great opportunity. So I took it and he ended up being mad at me for it, saying I had been using him and that he was gonna let me move in but I left instead, etc. After a week he apologized and we started dating long distance. Then I got sick and had to be put on antibiotics. I forgot about the contraindications with birth control and got pregnant. Started freaking out. BF said don't worry about it. Said to quit my job and come home and he will take care of us until I find work. 

I fought it for a while but he kept pushing me to quit and tempting me with how great it would be and eventually I gave up, quit and came back to search for a job. At first it was fine and then soon he started freaking out, wanting to control everything I did and who I talked to (we had never lived together before this). After three weeks he says to me that he doesn't really love me, doesn't know why he thought I did, this was all a mistake, I'll never find a job because I'm useless and we are completely wrong for each other. He says If I don't get an abortion he will fight me for custody because he thinks I am so worthless. This is the sum of what he said abbreviated, the things he actually said were far more detailed and cruel. He said these things after small arguments concerning how often I clean the house and where we should move to.

After realizing who he really is I agree an abortion would be best, especially because I have nowhere to go, no job to support myself or a baby, no friends to help me, no family who cares (the brother is mad I ever went back and says I deserve what I get). Now I have to figure out how to afford one, find a friend to take me and find another place to live, all while trying to find another job. I know I'm stupid and made mistakes here. It's just so hard to rise above when you are completely on your own. The hardest part is that this baby was wanted at first. An accident yes, but still welcomed and now I have to find a way to not want it, otherwise I will be condemning it and me to a worse situation than I am in now. 

TL;DR homeless, jobless, getting dumped while pregnant, no friends or family to help. Kind words are appreciated. Anything to MMFB about the abortion is appreciated.

She is all over the place and I know that sounds insensitive but I need space right now, and I don't want to hear her crying at the top of her lungs throughout the house all day and all night. I don't think my mother would like to deal with my sister either, but she has too. My parents had known each other for 40+ years, so she is going through her own process and is in complete shock. I can't even imagine what my mom is dealing with at the moment. The one problem I'm having is with my boyfriend of 9 months, he's not really understanding what I'm going through. He claims he does, but he really doesn't. He keeps saying jokes that are basically making fun of me and I tell him to stop and he gets annoyed that I don't want to hear them. He doesn't understand why I'm offended by them when they're direct insults that are ""jokes"". Last night I sort of teased him sexually in bed and then got incredibly sad and he seemed to be annoyed that I didn't want to do anything anymore. We barely cuddled last night, and this morning I got annoyed with him and he didn't even come over to comfort me. He told me, ""I thought you were asleep"". My boyfriend isn't giving me the support I need and I don't know how to tell him what I need without him getting upset or annoyed with me. He's focusing on his emotions and being kind of self centered in a way. I'm very emotionally unstable and he's not understanding that I can't really handle much right now. He sometimes gets annoyed with what I'm wearing if it's even a little not purposely slutty. I've been a little snappy and he gets upset with me for being like that, but I can't control my emotions at the moment. He has been sleeping over since saturday, so today is now wednesday and he said he'll want to hang out with his friends before he goes to college and I understand the importance of that but I told him I need support and he said, ""well I've been here for the past 4 days!!"" like it was some sort of task..which just made me feel worse. I don't think I'm being at all unreasonable saying that I should come first especially when I need this support right now. I love my boyfriend dearly, I just don't know how to make it work with us right now when I need his support the most.

EDIT: I was not expecting a response like this, thank you all so so much. I really appreciate all the advice and will take it all into consideration. Thank you for being such an amazing community, I will be sure to message when I need help or someone to talk to. Things have gotten better, my boyfriend admitted he has had no idea what to do. We just had the memorial service yesterday which was lovely. Thank you all so much again!!

I fucking give up.",32,2,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/1g309a/going_on_29yo_single_for_5_years_and_running/,"All through college I dated my first ""love"" and it was great.  We were infatuated with each other.  Soon after I graduated college though, the relationship fell apart.  3 months after we broke up she was in a new relationship... 9 months after that - engaged.  I took it hard, but continued to soldier on, hoping and praying that out there, there would be a girl waiting for me.



A year passed.. then another... then 3 more. 


Don't get me wrong - I'm putting myself out there.  I've dated girls... at least one every 2 or 3 months.  The connection just never happened for me.

So I continue to age.  I continue to watch as one-by-one everyone around me has the love of their life fall conveniently into their lap, while I'm here struggling.. alone... hopeless.

Then, last month, I met Evelyn.  Something hit me when I saw her for the first time.  I knew I had to ask her out... and after 3 months of waiting to cross paths with her again - I asked her out.  She said yes, and we went on a date last week.  I thought it was fun - we had drinks, good conversation.. it even got to a point where I thought maybe the convo was dieing and it was time to call it a night.  So I asked her if we should do another round.. she shrugged and said ""Sure!"".  I really felt she was interested in me.

Then today, we chatted and I asked her out again... ""Sorry, I have a lot going on right now, I don't think we should hang out again""

I'm CRUSHED.  It hurts so much to think you see a light at the end of a tunnel.. and then the light fades, and all you see is the darkness again.  I'm back at the start.  Completely alone again.

TL;DR: Almost 29 and still single.  I've been dating for years.  I'm tired of watching every glimmer of a relationship shrivel up into nothing.  Tired of watching all of my friends' relationships flourish while I continue going nowhere.  I fucking give up.

The short of it is I'm scared of the end of the course. 

As I will have to be ""in the real world"", have a job, be functioning etc. And after years and years of mental health struggles, its freaking me out that I will *have* to function, if I dont function and hold down a job after the end of this course, I will just be a finacial drain on my SO - who only earns minimum wage, and has no true responcibility to me, we aren't engaged or anything, he is just commited to me and loves me, but with someone in such an unstable mental state, it wouldnt be surprising that I would be left on my own.

And that may be a slightly negative outlook, but is not a farfetched one - monetary strain on anyone causes other strains elsewhere.

So aside form that, I have no family to speak of - alcoholic mother and a father who did unspeakable acts. neither I talk to, nor do I want to talk to. So I am truely on my own. I have to be in a functioning state of mind when I leave this course, I have to be able to apply myself, I have to be able to deal with the public, these are just given facts. they are need toos, must do's. there is no ifs ands or buts.

I am not elligable for state support after this course due to being supported through college by the state, and also living with my SO, his pay is supposed to support us both, when it doesnt even do that, and believe me when I say we have everything cut back and restricted in terms of out goings.

I am seeing a psychologist, working with DBT on attachment issues, anxiety, depression, abuse, PTSD, Trich, self confidence, etc. the list is as long as my arm. I am not receptive to medication, and they are not an option. I have valid reasons, please understand that.

Aside from all this stress, falling behind on course work, having no family, no one to help me, and being a drain on the only person who does support me even a bit, the friends around me, are very very few and far between. 

And when I am like this, I just cut off. I hate **hate** talking about this to others, becuase I get so curt, so closed, so un-me that people get offended by it. And I am well aware everyone has their own problems, and I dont want to be the broken record, or take over their time with my whinging, it may be justified for me so I feel better, but that doesn't justify it in my eyes, to take over someone elses life for that moment when tehy have their own monumental  problems going on.

I talk to my SO, but it hurts him so much to see me this way and be unable to fix me. 

So I am alone. Fragile. Stressed. on the verge of break down. And I just need it all to go away. I need people to care. So I am turning to you guys.

Just, be kind. Listen (read), and make me feel somewhat better, even just validation at this point. I'm so warn out with hurting so much, and letting bits out and people around me shrug like its what theyve all heard before. 

It damn hurts to have living blood realitives who love  a bottle of cider more than they have ever loved you, and you had to raise *them*, imagine going to school, age 8, having to sneak home to look after your new born sibling because your mother is passed out, cook, clean, bottle wash, and go back to school. That was my life. and I am tired and burnt out.

**I am so sorry, if this is too much and I understand if you close this, but I just need kindness.** 

I am sorry.

1352474291.0,30,self.MMFB,12wyuq,"My wife implied today that she feels threatened by me (physically), I have never threatened or abused her",34,4,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/12wyuq/my_wife_implied_today_that_she_feels_threatened/,"Well here's my story... I need to get it out somewhere.

Some background:
Recently I've been under a tremendous amount of pressure... I moved to Poland (from UK) in search for work, and marriage.
I recently found work, and after weeks of getting my official papers sorted (eligibility to work in PL etc) we are in the process of moving to our new flat in Poznan.

Moving is a stressful time for anyone, as we all know, but I'm finding this even more stressful, as I am starting a new job on Monday... I haven't worked in 2 years. So this is a big shock to the system.

I've been getting wound up over little things not going my way (stupid things, like PC restarting itself, things not working, TV not tuning etc) - and raise my voice in anger at the item in question.
Sometimes I may bash something that I know won't get broken - but even so I wont bash it hard... just enough to vent my frustration.

I get this frustration from my fathers side of the family (not that I am trying to make excuses), but even he never hit a woman.

So what happened?
We were in the car on the way back from the foreign office.
We are talking about getting stuff for the new flat... things we need.
Now we don't have much money to last us the first month before my payday, and I am questioning the bits on her list.
I suggest different things we can use... or I ask ""what if...""' kind of questions. - I want to save as much money as possible for the month ahead.
She starts getting all irate at me, and looking at me as if I have no clue what I am talking about.
One raised voice, leads to more raised voices.

I stop, and I explain to her that I am not raging, I was simply asking about alternatives to the things on your list. As we are strapped for cash, and we need to save rather than spend.
I said we don't have to get these items straight away, we can make do without them for a month.
But she was failing to understand the point I was trying to make.

This was winding me up, so I said ""f*ck it, buy what you want... I'll just go hunting in the nearest forest for food later in the month"".

It left a bad taste on the mouth for me to say it, so after 5 minutes, I said to her to calm down and try to understand where I am coming from. 
I'm not saying these things on purpose to wind you up, I am legitimately trying to save us money.
I said to her, if you need something, then fine. I may question it at first, but explain why you need it.
If I think it's fine, then it's no problem... or I may offer an alternative that you may not of thought of.

This wound her up even more, and she goes on about me ""raging all the time"" and ""smashing and breaking things"".
I said in my defense that I have never broken a single thing... I've been under a lot of stress, but I only vent it out on things that won't break, even so it's a controlled vent.
I said, if you seen me when I was much younger, you would realize how much ""rage"" is actually possible. (Was referring to my teen years - many years ago, which she apparently didn't catch on to and said...)
""What you gonna do? Hit me??""

I sat in silence, I mumbled ""I can't believe you just said such a thing"".

I said that I have never ever hurt her, never once threatened her, never even insinuated anything of the sort.
I said, yes I get angry... we may argue, but I would NEVER EVER hurt you.

She sat there... no remorse on her face, not a word in response.

Then I hear a ""You did raise your fist at me, when we had trouble with your papers"".

I knew exactly what she was talking about, and in my defense said ""I never raised my fist at you... if you looked, both my arms were up, and my hands were open"" (Kind of like in the movies where they scream at the skies)

She was still adamant about it.


All in all, I am so upset about this whole thing... that she would even consider this notion.

When we got back, I went to the bedroom, and honestly, burst out crying. (I am 25 years old, I haven't cried in over 10 years).
She still walks in, saying ""You don't think I was scared??"" and a few other things I failed to listen to.

Now the thing is... if she was genuinely concerned about my frustration issues lately, she would confront me about it. - I know my wife.
But she is so stubborn, that she still hasn't apologized for saying such awful things about me.

We have been married for some time now... 99% of the time we are fine... the 1% we may argue, like any marriage, but honestly, not a lot.
I love my wife so much, and it pains me to even think that she ever thought I would hit her. It makes me question about whether she feels safe around me.

I'm not in denial about some anger issues I have right now... but once I get comfortable in our new place and my new job, I will be back to my old self.
It's just that I would never... it sickens me even to think about it... and even upsetting me now just writing about it.

I would rather she confront me about my anger issues, rather than just come out with what she said.

I just wish that she never said such a thing... it really feels like my heart has been crushed and stamped upon.
The question is now, does she still love me? If she feels threatened by me, how can she stand being under the same roof as me?

As I have said, I have never hit or threatened a woman... ever.
I saw it once a number of years ago, and came to the defense of the woman... and if I ever see it again, I will always protect them from these disgusting people that abuse their partners.

I am not that kind of person... she knows that, yet still came out with what she said.


Sorry for the long post... it needs to go somewhere. 

Thanks for reading.

*EDIT*
Just want to say thank you to the constructive responses I have received.
I will be changing my ways once my new job starts on Monday - getting more exercise (for physical relief), using services to manage our finances, instead of arguing about it, and generally try to keep calm in frustrating situations.
I know to some, it may seem like I'm a bad and violent person, if you think that, then you are entitled to your opinion and I don't blame you. 
I just hope the people that do know me, know me better than that, and know that I will do anything to help keep my marriage in tact and keep the woman whom I love dearly by my side. 
I've quit smoking for her, and certain other habits, if I need to change my ways more, then I will.

Here are the bullet points. 

First off, I would like to say that I understand that I am nowhere near the bottom end of society. I have good health and don't go to sleep hungry. This is just the story of recent events that indicate a serious streak of bad luck/timing. 

Graduated with a B.S. in May with tens of thousands to repay. 

Beginning of June, I was charged with rape in the second degree. I didn't do it. There was no penetration, she just blacked out and was told we had sex. Conservative Christian. I was so drunk that night I couldn't even get it up. 

Lost all of my Uni friends. Undesireable No. 1. Outcast. Nobody wants to hang out with the maybe rapist. Alone for the summer. Couldn't move home, court order. Ex-friends didn't even want to hear my side of the story. 

Letter from the school banning me from the property. Can't go to any reunions, home games, anything. If I'm spotted on campus I will be arrested. 

In November, the case was coming down to her word against mine so I took a plea that was supposed to be for no jail time. This was an agreed-upon plea by both my lawyer and the prosecutor. She came in and begged for me to be punished, so I got a month in county. Lost my job. Spent Christmas and my birthday behind bars. 

The lawyer cost $50k. Worth it, I think. 

Got back together with my girlfriend (we were on a break at the time of the alleged rape). She then went abroad for the semester. Watched over Facebook as my girlfriend fucked every guy on her Fall study abroad program. Many times. And a lot of the locals, too. 

We almost got back together, until I read a message from her to a few of the guys she fucked that said, ""I miss having you in my bed."" Sent while she was visiting me and sleeping in my bed. 

Had to drive cross-country twice to move back home from Uni. Bought a lot of gas. Deep in credit card debt and still no job. 

In January, my car broke down. Computer too. Dentist says my orthodontist did it all wrong. Need major jaw surgery, followed by braces. Family can't afford it. 

February. After dropping my dad off at the airport, I forgot I wasn't carpooling anymore. Ticket for that and for speeding, although I was going with the flow of traffic. Officer said that wouldn't have mattered if I wasn't cheating the carpool lane. This one was definitely my fault. But still, bad timing. Did not get the minimum fine. 

About to sell a family heirloom to pay off debt. 

I only hope that there is some sort of statistical balance in the universe. Either I deserve this string of unfortunate events and it will stop soon, or later on I will have a slew of really good luck. Who knows?

**tl;dr** College debts, falsely accused of rape, $50k lawyer, month in jail, lost job, abandoned by friends, banned from alma mater, credit card debt, girlfriend fucked a whole country, need jaw surgery but can't afford, car and computer broke, speeding ticket, have to sell family heirloom.

Last year, I was doing my GCSE exams, and I was in bottom set for maths. I was there because I hadn't done very well on my first modular exam. However, I worked so hard, and even though I was taught the material up to a B, I taught myself the rest and gained an A. I then taught myself more complex algebra and calculus so that I could take an exam which would enable me to take an A Level in Accelerated Maths, which would mean that I took my whole maths A Level in one year instead of two, then take Further Maths A Level in my second year of college.

Anyway, I had a difficult start to the year maths-wise. Everybody else in my class had been taught all of the GCSE material, and some had already done the first module of the A Level as well. Because the teachers taught the class to these people instead of to people at my level (basically just me) I struggled a little. I ended up hiring a tutor and I then started doing a lot better.

Last week we had our first modular exam. I had done lots of past papers, getting 100% in some, and felt prepared. However, the exam was much harder and a little different from what we're used to, as in the question style was a little different. Everybody- and even the really good people in the class- thought that it was hard, and the best girl in the class cried because she thought it had gone so badly. I was upset too, because maths is important to me. I want to be a physicist.

Anyway, my maths teacher told us all that the questions were no harder than usual and weren't any different, to our protests. She has done the paper herself and told us that it was an ""easy"" paper. 

She told me that ""If"" I carry on with the subject next year (meaning if I pass the Maths A Level) I will do even harder stuff than that. She implied that I do not belong in a grammar school (a school you have to obtain especially high results to be able to attend) and that I am not suited to maths. She said I would need ""all the marks I can get"" in my next exam.

Please make me feel better, Reddit. I want to be a physicist, and failing maths would ruin my career. I was always very good at maths, lacking in confidence but very good, right up until this year, when I had this teacher.

We have been together for six months and are hopelessly in love with each other. She is my world. I owe my life to her; I was suicidal before she came into my life. When I met her, I thought I could be happy now. But we are constantly being separated, harassed, and persecuted because we are homosexuals. I'm not happy because she isn't happy. And because I' so worthless, I mess up trying to fix it and make things worse. 
Her parents accidentally found out about us early in the summer and banned her from any communication with me whatsoever. Our solution was that I would sneak out of my house at midnight and climb into her window using a ladder...which is my favorite memory of all time. It worked for a while, but not long; Because that's when I fucked up for the first time. Biggest fucking stupid mistake of my life: I *forgot the ladder there* one night and her dad found it. She had to tell him everything (I would have made up some lie about it, but my girlfriend is very bad at lying). As a result, my girlfriend's parents sent her to a mental institution for one week and then sent her off to stay with family in another state for the rest of the summer. I didn't see her at all, but she did have in her phone while in another state. At the end of the summer her mother came to my house, scolded me, and made me promise not to be romantic with her (I lied). But despite all of this my girlfriend forgave me, easily. And our separation only drew us closer until school started again (I'm a senior). Upon reuniting, my girlfriend gave me a journal she had kept over the summer inside which she had written me a letter every single day. She's perfect. After that horrifyingly lonely, painful summer, I thought now I could be happy seeing her every day, and she could be too. 
However, not far into the school year we were called out by the dean of students for holding hands. It's pretty suspicious that straight couples just blatantly make out in the hallways, but it's such an offense when I hold the hand of the girl I love. Things like this destroy her. She gets so depressed, and I cannot forgive anyone who makes her feel this way. Worse, she has to go home to her parents who have been so cruel to both of us. So I thought, I have to be her knight in shining armor. But I am weak and small and fragile. I cannot even take care of myself. The second time we were called out, it was clear how unjust this really is. Our offense this time is hugging. Come on, everyone hugs. I hug my teachers. I can hug my male friends, fine. But when I hug her it's apparently a PDA. I feel discriminated against and my girlfriend is extremely depressed. How can I console her if I cannot hug her? 
I talked to the school administrators today. I wanted to be a hero. I cried my eyes out the whole time, saying how unnecessary and painful this had become. And they sympathized greatly; but did not allow me to hug her still. I don't see how I can get away with touching her at all now. I feel powerless...
To top it all off, I fucked up again. The school contacted both of our parents about it and my girlfriend's mother has now lost all faith in me because I broke her promise. Also, my girlfriend yelled at me today. She looked so sad this morning, and to console her, I grabbed her hand under a table where no one could see. But she resisted and yelled, saying I don't get in as trouble as she does at all when I do these things. I just fail, and fail, and fail. I've found my princess but get no happy ending. I hate myself for failing so much. I cannot even hug the girl I love the most to ease my pain. I cannot ease hers. I only makes things worse each time. I want to punish myself. I used to self harm for two years before, and now I want to start again. I want me to hurt. My beautiful girlfriend deserves someone stronger. But if I lose her, my life will end. More than anything, I just want to see her smile. ",,False,,t5_2sjdn,False,,,True,t3_m833h,http://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/m833h/all_because_were_both_girls/,

This is my most valued friend. He's helped me through breakups, my parents divorce, deaths of loved ones, stupid little things that bothered me...you name it.
He has always been there for me when I needed him, he would cuddle up next to me and lick my nose and let me know that everything will work out ok. He's been with me for 13 years this November.
A few months ago he disappeared for a night, I was so worried. I took a flashlight and walked around in the woods calling his name. After about 11 hours of calling his name, checking his favorite hiding places, and shaking a 20lbs bag of cat food I heard a faint raspy meow from a nearby tree. Something (most likely a coyote) chased him up there and he had gotten stuck. I quickly climbed up the tree and carried him back home.
I collapsed onto the bed and was starting to fall asleep when I heard him coughing in the bathroom. When I went to go check on him I saw that he had thrown up a few times and he was wheezing really badly. I cleaned up the mess and combed his fur to try and relax him. Every other minute he would have a coughing fit. I was trying to not freak out. While combing I came across some dried blood and found the source, An inch long thorn was embedded into his neck. Me, having a mini panic attack, ran to my dad in the other room and frantically asked for his help. He refused saying ""He'll get it out himself, cats do that"" I wanted to punch him. I ran back to the bathroom and got out a pair of scissors, gauze, and some bandage tape along with a tweezers. I'll spare the details and just tell you I got it out without a problem. Lewis then crawled into his litter box and fell asleep. Which was really weird considering he is kind of snooty and only sleeps on furniture. I sat in the bathroom waiting for something else to happen, and guess what, something else happened. He woke up after a while and threw up this clear gooey liquid. Almost like drool. In half an hour he had thrown up about 7 times. I was in full blown panic because his wheezing was getting worse by the minute, he kept having coughing fits, the skin under his fur was red from a fever and it was 5am. I begged my dad to let me take him to the vet and he said "" No, leave him be""
So, being myself, I sneaked him out to my car and drove off.
When we got there the vet did an examination and notified me that there is a lump on the back of his neck. Assuming it was from the thorn, I explained that and he said this is different. He sat me down and went on to explain what was going on with Lewis...
Lewis has cancer and it's reached his lungs. There isn't much that can be done other than to make him comfortable.
I'm not sure how much longer he has left. I'm telling you this because...well I needed to tell people that would actually care. He is my best friend.

He is my life, my world. His father is a loser who doesn't pay support. So everything in my life I have worked for and gotten on my own. It isn't much but I do my best with what I have. 
What happened, It was 1 year 5months ago on Saint Patrick's Day. I meet up with my brothers in the morning to have a few drinks and spend time with them celebrating (they do this every year, this was the 1st and last time I will ever join in their festivities) Things got outta control (go figure) I had to make sure I picked my son up no later than 6pm. I was really drunk and kept asking them to just take me to him, and that I lost my phone so I couldn't call anyone close to him to pick him up for me. They didn't take me, we were late in getting back to my brothers place. I took off; I think I was crying most of the drive as I knew I was late. And all I was thinking of was my little boy waiting for me at school wondering where I was, as I was 45 minutes late in getting to him. I wanted to die inside just for that fact. I become the 1 thing I never wanted to be, that parent that is a loser and lets their child down.
Now when I get pulled over, I am in the passenger seat of the car. My dumb ass Tapped into a White Van (the ones with the gray bumpers) I tell they guy I am running late and keep going. (I should have given him my number; maybe he couldn't have called the police (even though there was not 1 lick of damage to either vehicle)) I arrive at the school (were my boy is) I go into the school apologizing for being so late, I had lost my phone, I am so sorry.... They have my friend on the phone (the one I would have had pick him up) I talk to her and she tells me she can pick me up, but the teacher at the school offered me a ride, AS I WOULD NEVER EVER! Have driven in that state with my son in the car. So she drives me home, or tried to. We drive past where I had tapped the Van, and he says, oh there she goes. They pull me over and so starts the fun. 
Fast forward to today. All the lawyers say is don’t worry ARD, ARD. Well they denied my ARD, now I get to go to jail for 3 days, pay massive fines I'm sure, and I have a feeling I will get a new bill for my lawyer.  
Why do I ask to make me feel better? I feel horrible, I feel like the biggest piece of shit in the world. I have never done anything wrong in my LIFE! I don’t want to go to jail. I can't sleep, I was crying last night and any time anything comes up that has to do with this entire mess of a situation. I don’t know how to get past this feeling and just suck it up. I want to get out of this mess, Run away and hide. The system treats you like you killed someone. I made a mistake! I’m SORRY PLEASE I AM SOOO SORRY.. I don’t even drink like that, it was a 1 time STUPID STUPID MISTAKE! Why can’t anyone forgive me, help me. All the trouble for a DUI is predetermined. You are a piece of shit and they don’t give a crap about why or anything. They just want to make sure you give them ALL of your money. They denied my ARD because my son was in the car, even though I wasn’t driving and never had intention of driving. Now they want to put me in Jail (72hr) and pay fines, probation and put this on my record for the rest of my life, and forget about car insurance.
 Well they are taking me from my son for that time, and also taking money from me takes activities I could do with him away, so they are hurting him as well. But then it all comes back to. If I would have made the 100 other choices that day this never would have happened. And now there is nothing I can do about it. They are labeling me a bad mother and a horrible person. And that is what I think. And I Can’t get it to stop, I know it is not true.. Someone help me…… I know this is a ramble… but thank you for listening.

I'm trying to make myself look more interesting in all kinds of ways, but in the end it always ends up pretty weird and maybe creepy not to mention pathetic and sad

Worst of all, I've got no goals. I used to make these sorts of things I'd achieve, but now i ran out and there seems to be no point of doing anything now. Really the only goal i have now is to go to bed and wish for some sort of an exciting dream.

I asked out a girl who i felt i could really trust, now that she rejected me we practically stopped talking. Ever since then i got into some really heavy moodswings. For some reason i feels as if she betrayed me even tough i don't exactly have an explonation to that.

Sometimes i just feel like sitting on the far side of the class so that i can avoid any contact. Sometimes i feel like i need to talk to people more but i know they're not interested. I always tried to be somewhat rational, but it's really getting out of hand lately. I don't know what I'm waiting for.

Before this, I was bored, depressed, and I just wanted to get the fuck away from home. I got a job offer, and I took it. I was ecstatic about it, I thought I was finally getting a start on my life. There was one thing that I didn't foresee, though. I was going to be alone with no friends or family nearby. It didn't take too long for this feeling to sink in.  

The first month of working the new job seemed fairly decent. The people seemed nice, and I was starting my career. About a month into the contract, I began having second thoughts about taking the job offer. Sure, it was a job, and it was (faintly) related to my degree, but I just can't stand this kind of work. I end up spending at least 90% of my time sitting at a desk going over documents and emails, or setting up meetings. I find no joy in it; I have never felt any semblance of excitement or anticipation to come into work. I end up being angry on my drives to and from the office because of the traffic/other drivers. It's hard to find anything positive that my time here has given me.  

I ended up spending my birthday alone. No one had actually called me or spoke to me in real-time that day. The best I got was a bunch of Facebook posts mostly because there's a handy little reminder for people so they can look like they care. I haven't spoken with my family in over half a year. I've been sad/depressed, and I don't want to talk with them in this state. At least, that's what I tell myself. I spent Thanksgiving by myself, and I'll end up being alone for Christmas and New Year's as well. I haven't made any friends in the area. I never had a visitor outside of family (and that was only once). The people I work with don't really talk with me, and I seem to be left out of conversations or whatever quite a bit (especially lately).  

I know people will say that this is something that I could fix by changing things about myself, and I know this is probably true. It's just hard to do that when you feel like there's no one to support you or help you. It's like being in a hole with no way to climb out. I know I don't want to be like this anymore, but I don't know what I can do.",,False,,t5_2sjdn,False,,,True,t3_nee0h,http://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/nee0h/ive_messed_up_my_life/,

",33,4,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/mrt4p/i_am_suffer_from_chronic_unyielding_loneliness_i/,"I am a chronic sufferer of loneliness.  Ever since I entered middle school at age 11, I've always been alone.  Plenty of acquaintances over the years, but no friends, no companions.  Just me.  I'm 23 now.  


I've spent a decade staring suicide in the face.  I no longer fear death.  But I don't want to die.  It would be so inconvenient for people like my family, who do not know my pain and are too ignorant to understand (my past attempts to communicate this pain were fruitless).  They simply don't know how bad it can be.  I haven't wanted suicide in about three years now, but I still feel such a bad pain in my chest from loneliness sometimes that I wish I could cry.  But I can't cry.  I haven't been able to since I was 14.  


I am a good person.  I am polite, I help people whenever possible, I try to be generous, I am smart and well-informed, I've been told I'm handsome/cute/good looking, and I always try my best.  I'm going to university to become a teacher.  I don't do these things because I think I'm owed or that I fear NOT doing them.  I do them because I choose to, and because it makes me feel good to do them.  But I am still so lonely.  


I want to love a girl.  I want to know a girl that I can talk to and feel like she's understanding what I'm saying and not just passing the time by talking to me.  I want to be the best boyfriend in this girl's life that she'll fall in love with me, and be the best girlfriend in my life.  I want to fall asleep next to a girl, happy to know that she is right there.  I want to feel excited whenever I get a text because ""Oh my god, it's her!""  I want to be concerned for someone else as a SO, not just as an acquaintance.  


I'm not really interested in sex.  I'm still a virgin, but I don't care.  I think I might be asexual, but I'm probably just so inexperienced that I don't know how to want it.  I'm probably demisexual if I'm anything, so I couldn't have sex with someone that I didn't truly love and care about.  I can't remember if I've ever wanted someone sexually.  


But that's beside the point.  I want a companion.  A best friend.  She doesn't even need to be around me all day, every day.  She just needs to be in my life, and for me to know that she loves me and that I love her.  I want a girl to hold close to me, to hug me.  To cuddle with.  To listen to my embarrassing insecurities and tell me her embarrassing insecurities in turn.  We'll reassure each other.  I want to kiss her.  I want to hold her hand.  I want to watch movies with her, like WALL-E, and love the details and trivia behind it.  I want to talk about philosophy with her.  I want to play video games with her.  I want to stroke her hair, and for her to stroke my forearm while we talk in bed before going to sleep.  I want to go on a cross-country trip with her and have an adventure and make memories together.  I want to know where she's ticklish and for her to know where I hate being touched so we can bug each other.  I want to look at her while eating dinner and admire her because I love her so much.  I want her to leave me little notes to find in places because she loves me so much.  I want to hear her giggle at the little jokes I make, and I want her to send me whatever interesting little things to read whenever she finds them.  


I want to love someone.  


But why do all the people I meet feel so far away?  Why do all the girls I talk to have no impact on me, even absolutely beautiful and intelligent ones?  Why am I this way?  Why am I so good at living alone and being alone all the time as the introverted person I am, but still feel such a yawning, aching emptiness inside me for someone to love?  And then not feel it for people I should?

I'll just describe each of the title's events in their own bits.

1. My boyfriend and I have been down to counting pennies all week. I've been torn up with stress and guilt over him not being able to have nice things like caffeine for his long early commute to work every day (not something he complains about, but I want him to have so much).

2. A week ago my boyfriend's nice Toshiba laptop was stolen. We were both tired and in a rush at a pawn shop. He had the old netbook in the bag with his laptop and we forgot the bag and laptop in a rush to get him to class. I went back and found out that the security footage revealed that some stupid kids took off with it. No record of a transaction with them.

3. My birthday was Wednesday. I'm not a big birthday person whatsoever, but I think anyone is a little extra inclined to be sad on their birthday if it's shitty. We're groomed to think it's important. I spent the day alone after work because my boyfriend's Wednesdays are extremely long. I thought today would be nicer, as my dad was going to take us to dinner. We got a free meal, and he gave me some money as a gift!

4. And then we went home, and our big barn cat Payton was on the floor, pale and limp. I tried and tried to resuscitate him. I still taste it. It's awful. We rushed to an emergency vet. They couldn't save him. They think it was likely heart failure-- maybe the effect of a genetic condition we didn't know of. We haven't had the money to get such tests since we adopted him in January. The gift money has to pay (most of) our vet bills. We'll have no extra money for quite a while. The other cats are going to be so sad and confused. My boyfriend is utterly crushed.

I'm so tired. I've been tired for so long. I've cried so much lately, and now it hurts to a point I can hardly stand. My head aches and my skin is so dry that my tears really, really burn.

Today I was wondering whether some awesome clothes that were way too small last year would fit now, so I tried them on.

They did, they looked great. With my hair done, some make-up.. I could look quite *pretty* now, even. I looked almost like a woman who would 'deserve' a boyfriend. I never felt like that before.

Don't get me wrong, I'm NO prize at all. I'm not deluded. But I do look.. okay, now.

I've gone from morbidly obese girl to slightly fat/chubby smart/neat looking woman. I take a lot of care of myself now, like my style, do my hair and make-up, and.. I really feel I look presentable. Maybe even attractive, to the right guy.

But I can't be happy. I try to be, my health, my own esteem.. I have gained those things. But I'm not happy. I was happier when I was fat.

I have no one to share it with. I did have a boyfriend, but I broke up with him recently. We met on OkCupid. He was completely into me at first (or acted like it), asked me to be his girlfriend after a couple of months. Few months later, turned out that he only wanted me to be his girlfriend to have sex/affection on tap whilst he flirted and tried to 'pull'/date other women. Hotter women. Curvy, voluptuous ladies that I could not even begin to 'compete' with. Granted, none of those women were interested in him.. but that's not the point.

I wish he could see me now, in my 'new' clothes. Just to see his face. I havn't lost that much weight since he last saw me, but I looked *good* today. I looked almost equal to the 'hotter' women he was trying to get with while 'being with' me. Almost. I still have the loose skin underneath, and that hint of a double chin, flat boobs from weightloss.. But I looked nice.

I live in a small town, and financial circumstances mean I can't move out - or even travel out a lot of the time. I can't even afford to get a new job and move.. I'm in the UK, and everything is so expensive. I like my single life here, I have hobbies and interests.. but absolutely no way to find more friends or date. I don't want to do internet dating, not now, not after the last experience. I trusted him, and he crushed me. I don't even want to see another dating website right now.

No man whose face will light up when he sees me looking extra nice for him in the clothes that now fit, no friends to go for a drink with, no one to cuddle with infront of a film or playing a video game. No one to be happy to be seen with me, smile at me. No one who thinks plain ol' me is beautiful. No one for me to love wholly back. And no real way for this to happen in the future, either.

I feel I'm getting old before my time. Mid-20s, already destined to be a spinster, with no one happy to see her. I'll never see someones face light up at me, get a loving kiss..

So, it's not just about sex, but here's the rest of the post...

We have occasional sexytime only on the horny night of her cycle, and miss out on most of those even... She insists on me initiating, but even trying less than once every couple weeks it's a 80%+ rejection proposition... She says it's because there's something wrong with how I'm approaching... not masculine enough, not connected enough, not &lt;some behavior&gt; enough... We've discussed this much and it's kind of like she's saying ""hey, if you were rev'd up more then maybe it would have worked.""... But it's become impossible to come to it rev'd up with this rejection rate, the rejection crash afterwards is painful enough (emotionally, and uncomfortable physically) without being rev'd up... Even when we get past the rejection, the sex isn't that great anymore, and I'm feeling lost :-(

It's not like I'm repulsive or anything either... I'm in great shape... She's constantly commenting on how much she loves my smell...  It's also not like she's a prude or anything... maybe it's because her self-judgement?  She's 70+ lbs over what would be commonly thought of as a healthy weight, but she knows that it honestly doesn't make me any less desirous of her (unfortunately)...

I'm totally committed to her, love her so much, and although divorce has been tossed out in anger occasionally in our 20 years, it's certainly not a part of our reality... we're together for life and we both know that...  but just this morning I came to honestly admit to myself that the pain in the rejection is just too much to bear, and I've given up on any hope of happy good sexytime anymore :-(

She was so happy for me that she bought me a lot of stuff for my dorm (even up until the day before she passed). She was always telling me she wanted to have my smarts. I would give all this up just to have her back... I still remember her last birthday when she blew out her candles and made her wish... She didnt say anything but she started crying and we all knew what she was wishing for.

I had recently broken up with my girlfriend at the time, and meeting her made me feel born again. I fell in love pretty much at first sight, but shortly I learned that she had a boyfriend. I was dissapointed but decided to move on with my life, except she started looking for me. She would always come to sit with me and chat at my desk, text me during the weekends to find out how I was, she added me on Facebook and would message me every night as soon as I logged in. We started to become really good friends, and then a mutual friend, and co-worker passed away in a traffic. accident. It was really hard on her, so I became worried and tried my best to be there for her. This only made us closer, and we started talking on the phone staying up all night, only to hanging up to get ready to go to work. I finally confessed my feelings for her one night in her car, and she told me she felt the same way but wanted to keep me as a friend. I understood this but told her I had fallen in love with her and I was going to need some time and space to get over her. I knew I wasn't going to be able to be her friend and be close of I had feelings. She eventually told me she eventually told me she loved me too we hugged for a long time and I ended up kissing her. 

After this we began seeing each other. At first it was very secretive, only going out late at night and she usually come to see me. It was amazing, I've never felt this way before for someone. It was excilirating. She told many times that she also had never felt this way before. I thought it would be a matter of time until she broke up with her boyfriend to be exclusive with me. We had so many talks about life and our thoughts am she confessed that she never trusted anyone else as muh as she did me. She told me I knew her better than anyone, even her friends and family, even her boyfriend. Once she looked at me in the eyes and tolde I was the love of her life. I felt exactly the same. I knew from the beginning I wanted to spend the rest of my life with her. 

Well time went by, she found a paying job and so did I, so we stopped working together. And it wasn't happening. She hadnt broken up with her boyfiend. After an incident when he saw her running into my car, we finally talked about it and she tolde that she was in love with both of us and could make a decision. She was torn and knew that choosing one would mean losing the other and she knew that either way her heart would break. This is when things started going wrong, I told her I wanted to be exclusive and be her boyfriend but if she couldn't leave the other guy I would understand. She would always beg me not to leave her because she thought I would stop being her friend too. She told me she needed me in her life. She confessed to me that she and her boyfriend were no longer intimate. They wouldn't have sex for months and fight about it. She thought there was something wrong with her and had gone to therapy for it. But we had sex all the time and it was amazing. She told me with me she had love, passion, intimacy, and support and understanding. We kep seeing each other, but started fighting more often. Then one friend asked me if she was with me or not because her Facebook said she was in a relationship with some other guy. I checked and coulnt see anything, it turns out she had blocked me and few of my close friends from seeing her relationship status. That was big fight that eventually would be the root to everything ending. 

I stopped trusting her from this point on but I still loved her and believed she would be mine one day. She did eventually break up with him on New Year's Eve, and came to see me. I thought finally she's mine! But our problems didn't go away. He wasn't ready to be my girlfriend but instead of telling me she would just keep treating me like a secret. I wanted to be a part of her life so badly. I should've been more patient, she did get out of a very long relationship (5 years) and she wasn't truly over it either. She broke it up for me. But tey remained friends. The thing was, he always knew about me and told her he understood. Well, I wasn't happy and she wasn't happy. But out relationship was still good. We spoke every night on the phone and chatted over Facebook at work. We did see each other once a week or every two weeks. Sometimes we would go Oma snowboarding trip or have a sleep over (at my house of course)

Things didn't change and my feelings of unhappiness towards not being in the relationship I wanted to be got bigger and bigger. We were fighting on regular bases. Many I was ready to give up, break it off and move on but kept coming back because it was too painful to not speak to her. I missed her and we still wanted to be in each other lives. She finally confessed to me after me begging for an answer that she wasn't ready for a relationship. She wanted us to be more casual (something she would never thought she would say) mainly because he wasn't ready for the transition of having a new boyfriend. She didn't want the pressure of having to do any explaining. I thought fine, I can do that but it did hurt.

We kept on having an on and off relationship and had many fights. Her now ex was still a big part of her life, and in my opinion she never did anything to ""end"" her relationship with him. All her friends and family thought of them as being an item. There was constantly pictures of them at parties on Facebook and comments from friends about the two of them. I would usually lose my mind and call her to confront her, her excuse was they were both invited and had gone separately, and she couldn't control what people said on Facebook. 

I had hurt her so much that it was becoming hard for her to be intimate with me and the idea of a relationship was hard to imagine. We tried being romantically involved and it didn't work, she really wanted to have me in her life as her best friend. I couldn't understand why, I still love her despite everything she had done that hurt me.

One night I finally had it. We had grown apart so much and it would weeks without seeing her. Our phone conversations didn't happened as much anymore, and the fusing out she was still hanging out constantly with her ex made me lose it. She told me the reason she hung out with him was because he never put any pressure on her. They would just hang out and talk about other things. She said I always asking her what was going on? Whether we were together or not? It eventually became stressful to see me and talk to me because of it. I was drowning in uncertainty and I needed clarity. So one night after a huge argument I lost my temper over the phone, yelled and cussed at her an hung up. The next day I called her and told her, what we were doing wasn't healthy and we should stopped talking to each other and seeing eah other for a while, and that maybe one day we could be friends. She said ok. 

That was a year and half ago. I constantly break down every few months and go stalk her twitter/Instagram. She blocked my number and Facebook. I'm sure she blocked my emails too. I can't stop thinking about her. I miss her. I feel like we were right for each other but we didn't handle properly the circumstances under which we met. Anyways, she got back with him shortly after. About a year later they bought a house got engaged and today is their wedding day. 

I tried reaching out to her. I even saw her once for a few seconds this week. I wanted to beg her no to get married. I've had the worst week of my life. It's pretty obvious she's over me and wants nothing to do with me. I did speak to her per chat once briefly last year and when I asked her why we find work out all she said was ""I'm sorry but it wasn't meant to be""

Since I stopped talking to her, I've gotten involved in many activities. I played in a soccer league for a while, I took acting courses. I'm in a band, I've been in a couple of short films both behind and in front of the camera. I went on a trip to my home country in South America. I've tried dating, I have an online dating profile. I still can keep her our of my mind. I miss talking to her, I miss having her to cheer me up, support me and hear me about whatever was going on in my life. I imagine myself having conversations with her constantly. I start a new job, and on the first day I picture myself telling her how my day was, what my job is like. But I neer actually talk to her. 

I did think she was the love of my life. Instill think she is, but seeing her and build a life with someone else is tearing my soul apart. 

I know this was the wrong person to get involved with. Everything points to it. But she hve something no one else has. I felt connected to her and close. At one point we were crazy for each other but our problems pulled us apart. 

She is getting married today. I lost. I lost her. She starts the rest of her life with some one else today, and I'm just sitting here alone typing this. My heart is broken. I thought I was doing fine, but this week was a huge step back. I don't even want to move on, I just want to feel sad. 

TL;DR - I met a girl and feel in love. She was in a relationship, I was her affair. After it all went to hell she got engaged to her boyfriend and is getting married today.

Well, no. Not great. If things were *truly* great, this wouldn't be happening.

On paper, you're everything I want in a man. You're kind, compassionate, intelligent, funny, level-headed, supportive. You have a secure job in a prestigious career. 

But I guess relationships don't operate on a checklist of requirements. Because these past few months, I've felt so miserable. The spark is gone (was it ever truly there?) and our differences - which used to be so endearing - are starting to rear their heads more and more. My significant other should energize me, but I only feel drained and anxious around you.

I'm coming over tonight to end things. I've felt sick to my stomach for the past two days and have hardly any sleep to show for it. I love you, I care about you, but I don't see us working out. Sometimes failed relationships don't boil down to an ""asshole guy"" or a ""clingy, needy girl"" or other obvious red flags.

Sometimes two otherwise perfectly normal, stable people just don't work out.

I've never broken up with someone this long into a relationship before, and I'm scared as hell. As much as I hate it, I know what I do tonight will hurt you. But I can't stay with you just because I'm scared to upset you or leave you alone. 

My only consolation is that this shouldn't come as a huge surprise. This past month and a half, we've had two serious talks about our relationship crumbling. We tried to jump-start it, but in my heart of hearts I knew it was nothing more than a new layer of paint over the cracks.

My hope for tonight is that you feel, at least partially, the same way.

I love you and want you to be as happy as you can.

Unfortunately, that's just not with me.

I really don't want it to be a big deal, so I want to just tell someone so I don't have to think about it. 

Last year, I got drunk and slept in the same bed with a friend's male friend. This is because there was only one bed, and I didn't think it was a big deal. He was pretty touchy at first, which should have been a clue to tell him to get the fuck out, but I told him I didn't want to do anything and turned my body away from him, thinking that was it. I woke up to him groaning and shoving his fingers inside me. I told him to stop, and I turned away again, but I didn't tell him to leave the bed! I don't know why! I felt totally grossed out and horrified. The rest of the night, he kept edging his hands to my waist band and not letting me sleep, even though I kept telling him I just wanted to go to sleep. WHY THE FUCK didn't I tell him to get out of the bed!? 

Finally, I was sick of his advances, but not having the balls to tell him to get out, I asked him if I could just blow him so he would stop bothering me. I swear, all I wanted was for him to stop waking me up. It was awful, and I feel totally fucked up for doing it after he treated me like that. I wasn't into it at all, because I just wanted him to cum and be done with it. I asked him what I could do to make him cum, and he said talk about how wet I was, so I said that hoping it would work. Instead, he climbed on top of me, and I was fucking terrified. I told him that I didn't want to have sex at all, and all I wanted to do was go to sleep. Thankfully, he moved off of me. A few minutes later, he left the bed.

Even with the present frustrations, I still do. If I didn't, perhaps I wouldn't be so frustrated.

My wife has PCOS- polycystic ovary syndrome. It leads to excesses of estrogen and testosterone, some weight gain, some excess body hair, and a complete loss of sex drive.

We've been trying to treat this for years. When we met in 2005, married in '07, and even up to about 2009, there were no symptoms, our sex life was great, and all was right with the world.

Late '09 and into early 2010, she was diagnosed with PCOS. She can't take the birth control because she feels poorly on it, and metformin hasn't done squat.

The weight gain doesn't bother me. It's at most 10 pounds, and at 5'7"", being 158 pounds isn't bad. Bothers her more than me. The hair growth is mostly just a small patch under the chin. She shaves it off and it's gone.

Worst is the low libido and lack of sex drive. We can go more than a week without sex, and even then, I can tell that most of the time she's doing it because she thinks she owes it to me, not because she wants it. The last time I can think of where she acted like her old self during sex was more than a month ago.

Half the time, she can't get wet enough to make it comfortable for her, and she hasn't been able to orgasm in months. This is all despite copious foreplay, everything I can think of to make her feel special and loved.

All of my friends are states away and it feels awkward to outline the depressing details to them, so I don't really have an outlet to process this.  If you choose to read this, thank you for listening.

Basically what happened:

I am currently employed in a state across the country from where my parents live, but it's a temporary position and about to end in 1 month.  Ever since I started this job, I've been looking for work, networking, and trying to build career opportunities for myself.  (If you're in the Bay Area, hit me up!)

Coming from a different generation, my dad doesn't understand why I've been struggling so hard to find permanent full time employment since I graduated with my Master's degree last May.  He's never been unemployed and has had a 6 figure salary for most of his career.  My mom is a stay at home mom who has never held a job.

Anyway, so one day (about 2 weeks ago now) my parents sent me a bunch of e-mails in a row about me looking for work and how I need to find a job.  They've been doing this consistently ever since I moved out here, and I was getting a bit fed up with yet more e-mails about how disappointed they are and how I need to get my life together.

So I responded by reaching out to them emotionally, which I never do (complicated family history), and outlined just what I've been going through.  How I need to go where someone gives me a job and have little choice in the matter.  I listed out some of the numbers of job applications I've sent out over the past year (I lost count as I wasn't keeping my spreadsheet up to date, but it's in the hundreds).  I asked them to please lay off the pressure for a while and not tell me how disappointed they are in me.

My dad's response was to ignore all that, and repeat himself about how I need to get better work and make better choices by moving somewhere with a lower cost of living.  A bit baffled and hurt, I told him that he was being ignorant and not listening to the reality of my situation.

Well, that's when shit blew up.  My dad calls my other family members and rants about how he doesn't know what to do with me, causing panicked calls and messages being sent to me.

Next, I get two e-mails from my dad.  The first is addressed to me but CC'd to the rest of the family where my dad tells me that he's decided to retire after the next year and will be taking a large salary reduction and focusing on vacations with my mother.

The second is a private e-mail to me telling me to change all of my permanent addresses on my major accounts to my current one (I was still using their house while I was moving around for consistency on my bank accounts), that I will need to get a new cell phone number (number was still on their family plan), and that if I end up unemployed after my temp position to not use their health or dental insurance under Obamacare or to refer to their home address in any way from now on.  Essentially, he told me to cut off my last ties to them.

My dad signed it saying that they wish me good luck in my job search.

After that, another weird e-mail about how I should e-mail my dad's secretary to live with her brother in San Francisco, but that my dad otherwise wants nothing to do with it or me.

I haven't heard from them since, and it's just been getting bits of information filtered through my siblings.  My oldest sister said I should definitely cut ties with them as soon as possible, but for different reasons.  Apparently my parents had been trying to snoop into my bank accounts and phone account, trying to find a way to read my text messages.  Also, they've apparently read insurance statements accidentally sent to their house and the fact that I've had appointments at Planned Parenthood might be factoring into this.  Oldest sister thinks I should cut my losses and run, possibly look into restoring links with them in the future but at a cool distance.

My second oldest sister is upset that the family is being a bit torn apart and wants me to make up with them and apologize to my dad for calling him ignorant.  :/

And yeah, apparently I'm no longer welcome at family holidays from now on.  Sigh.

I don't understand this or my parents' behavior.  I don't know why they think I deserve this.  My theory is that my dad panicked thinking that I was about to ask for money or to move in with them, but in reality I just wanted some emotional support, or at least to not be torn down by them.  I have *never* asked them for money.  Now I'm just completely emotionally cut off and cut off from any kind of support from them.

So far I've been saying fuck 'em and I'm pretty ok with it.  It's been a long time coming for various reasons.  The timing is horribly unfortunate, though.  Because now my support system is 100% messaging friends who are out of state.  Because of my transitory status, it's been really hard to make close friends out here.  I'm pretty much alone and it's a weird feeling, and feels pretty dangerous considering how depressed I've been getting over various aspects of my life not working out and then this.

It'd be really nice to have an example of the light at the end of the tunnel.  Because all of this struggling and then feeling ridiculously emotionally abandoned sucks pretty hard.

Not to say that it's that bad.  I know a lot of people out there have had it worse, with abusive parents or parents with alcohol/drug problems, or no parents at all.  With me, I have parents.  They just don't want to support me or be in my life anymore for whatever reason.  It feels so weird.

I think the ""fix"" for me is to build a ""family"" elsewhere.  I've had trouble with that in my past, though &lt;insert cult joke here&gt;.  I think finding awesome friends to have that with is great, but the problem is that I still need to make friends out here.  Oh well.

my dad doesn't talk to me aside from telling me how better he always is than me when he was my age and degrading everything that I do. he keeps mentioning that I'm a disappointment because I decided to study in engineering while he wanted me to become a doctor (the classic Asian family story).

The thing that I don't get is that everybody loves my older brother, although he studied in finance and not health sciences, he never does anything, and always needs to borrow money from my parents because he's always in debt. up until now my dad GAVE (not borrowed... GAVE) 75 000$ to my brother for absolutely no reason at all, while he refused to LOAN me some money to help me  pay the down payment for my house, even though I promised to pay him back. he also bought my brother two cars (one Acura that he totalled).

Once I even stopped helping my parents around, figuring that my brother, being the favourite, could step in and do something at least. what happened was that I received a barrage of calls from my sisters and brother saying that I was ungrateful and that I should do more for my parents.

Another thing that happened very recently is that my dad invited everybody for an all expenses paid vacation to a resort this summer. everybody was invited.... except me. and they didn't even tell me that they were leaving. I learned it while I came over my parent's as I usually do on Saturday to mow the lawn and clean the house, but noticed nobody was home. I called my dad and when he answered, he called me an idiot because he'd get roaming charges on his cell.

What I'm trying to say is that I feel hated by the people that are supposed to love me the most, my family. I've never purposely done anything wrong all of my life and yet, they don't call me aside for asking for help, or criticizing me for not helping when I can't. It isn't helping me that my birthday is coming up and that I'll be alone for the first time in 24 years on that day.

These are pictures of my cat Shadow, two before, when he was younger and this was not a problem, and two that I took this morning. He's always been a character, because his meow is weird and rattly and because he likes to sleep in the sink and happily licks the faucet when there is water pouring down on him. And he's always trying to hump Snowflake, our girl cat, because he seems not to know he's been neutered his entire life. He's such a sweetheart, even if his front paws weren't declawed he wouldn't ever try to claw up anyone. He doesn't even bite, he just goes limp when you pick him up.

About a year ago at his vet checkup he had lost weight, and the vet told us he has an overactive heart, meaning he burns up calories too quickly for his body and can't gain weight... this seemed fine since he gained weight halfway through the year, but in the past month or so, he's started looking more skeletal. When we started watching him we realized that he literally never eats. After the vet told us he found nothing else wrong, and he might just have lost his sense of smell, my mother bought a flat of really expensive special diet food for him, and he nibbles a bit on it as we try to fend off the other cats (Socrates is a fatty). But then he loses interest. He'll eat a bit off our finger, or off a spoon, but the story's the same - half an ounce into the food he just stops and wanders over to the sink, and sits, meowing pathetically. I can feel his ribs individually, feel every bone of his spine, fit my thumb and pointer finger around his stomach just in front of his legs. He's more skeletal every day.

We tried oil-packed tuna... We've tried fish oil on their food, tried loving up on him to try to coax him into eating, but we just can't make him do it. I don't know if there are any other options for getting him the nutrients and calories he needs but I have this strong sense, I just... *know* that he is dying, a little bit every day. And I wish so much I could make this easier for him, because starvation is one of the most awful deaths I can think of, it's so slow and miserable, and I can't do *anything* about it.

TL;DR: Shadow is slowly starving to death. Should we keep trying to feed him, or put him down? Every time I think about it I start crying.

I love my cats to death. They were furry little balls of comfort whenever my family was being stupid, and they bounded up to greet me every single day I came home from school. How will Socrates and Snowflake cope? Should we just put Shadow out of his misery? Make me feel better, reddit...

EDIT: Shadow had lost an entire pound since the last check-in a month ago. He only weighed like 6-7 lbs in the first place. When the vet attempted to draw blood, his veins kept collapsing because they were so thin and he was dehydrated -  eventually they got some and are going to do every sort of test, but they also mentioned that they could feel his thyroid gland, making it pretty likely to be hyperthyroidism, which is actually good news, since that's one of the things we can actually treat. As mom talked to the vet I found out he also has cardiomyopathy, which is permanent damaged function, though I think he was just born with that. Hopefully if the thyroid treatment works his heartbeat will slow down too. We currently have him sleeping on a heating pad and blanket (his temperature was below normal) and have fed him anorexia diet wet food a few times through a little oral syringe. We will have the results tomorrow morning. Thank you all for your suggestions and support and I will update tomorrow as well. :)

EDIT 2: The results came in and mom texted me them at school. Shadow is in liver and kidney failure and there's really nothing that can be done to save him at this point, so we're putting him down - if mom can get home early enough, tomorrow evening, if not, Thursday evening. He's been laying in a corner of the living room he's been in for days, been using his carrier in that room to urinate since he can't make it to the litterbox. Sometimes he wanders listlessly, calls out loudly in distress, but mostly he just lays on his side with his eyes open, quiet. I've already sat holding him for an hour today, crying, but undoubtedly I'll do my share of mourning tomorrow as well. I'm just very glad I don't have to do it alone. My boyfriend's been with me all afternoon, as well as at the vet yesterday, and he's offered to come tomorrow too. I feel kind of numb. All I can really do is let Shadow know we love him and want to comfort him, even if he wants to hide from us, and keep him as comfortable as possible with towels, blankets, heating pads. And that we have been doing.",,False,,t5_2sjdn,True,,,True,t3_sca3o,http://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/sca3o/my_8yearold_cat_is_dying_of_selfimposed_starvation/,

by Brianna Wiest	 

Nothing is eternally damaged. Not even you. I think we have a tendency to exacerbate things in our minds by the way of not being able to let them go. Logically, it makes sense to stop thinking about something that upsets you, but we just can’t. It’s like we want to torture ourselves. It’s like we want to think through the issue just one more time and see if we can find the light at the end of its tunnel but we never will. We just drop ourselves further into the cesspool and we can drown ourselves there.

After a particularly difficult phase of my adolescent life, (it seemed difficult to me at the time) I asked my mom, why me. And she immediately said no, you’re not going there. She told me that everybody has these issues (referencing the specific ones I had at the time). Everybody deals with these things. She did, her friends did, my ancestors did in one variation or another. This was nothing new and this is nothing that I have been solely victimized to.

And I think her words hold true for a lot of things. Yours was certainly not the first heart to be broken — in fact, I would say that unrequited and lost love is the most common tale of human suffering of all time. If anything, what we should learn from the past is that its normal. It’s almost guaranteed to happen in one way or another or in one form or another.

So we just can’t sit around and let ourselves crumble when these things do happen — even when we’re feeling like all of our worst fears came true and there’s no reason for going on. Even when you feel lifeless and like there’s nothing that can propel you out of it– well, you’re right about one thing. You are the only way you will be propelled out, one small step at a time.

I supported her all through college, helped her through the passing of her father, and we were even making plans about marriage. And now.. I feel all of that is pissed away. 2 weeks after we broke up she found a new guy and they look genuinely happy together. I'll admit it, the last year and a half wasn't our strongest but I thought we would get passed all the dumb arguments. Anyways... I tried to force myself into dating other girls but get rejected.

",28,4,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/1au91z/im_bipolar_my_mom_just_told_me_she_wants_to/,"I was recently diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder. Getting a diagnosis is helpful, especially in terms of getting treatment, but there's something about it that makes me feel like a crazy person. I'm on a mood stabilizer, which seems to be helping, but sometimes I feel flat. I also have Ativan for when I start to freak out, which I try to use less than a few times a month. I just feel like I'm down ALL THE TIME and I can't pull myself out of it and like I can't win. For example - it's Friday, I want to go out and have fun, but I can't really drink, and I hate standing around sober with large crowds of people in loud places. But when I stay at home like tonight, I feel miserable and like a giant loser. :/

I'm home from college on spring break and my mom is really drunk and informed me earlier that she can't handle life anymore. This is is really hard because she seems to be the only stable thing in my life and she kept talking about how it isn't worth it and she can't do it and all of that. My stepdad and her friend took her to get help, and I think she's going to be okay, or so they've told me, but it just really unsettled me. I feel bad now for the bazillion times I've called her crying telling her that everything is out of control and I want to drop out of school and I hate everyone. It sounds like she feels the same way. 

The best part of my life right now is my boyfriend, who I love so, so much. We've been seeing each other for almost a year, and plan to live together this summer. We go to school hundreds of miles apart though, which really complicates things. On one hand, I really just want to be with him, to be able to sleep in the same bed as him and talk to him in person and not feel like I have to cram months at a time into a single visit. On the other hand, I recognize that college is supposed to be a time of growth and self-discovery, and that I need to be grounded. We're in an open-relationship, which, I'm both insecure about, but I don't know if I could handle exclusivity either. I know long distance is making me miserable, but I also know that I **love** him and he makes me so happy. And I believe he feels the same way too. 

I guess all I'm looking for is stability. I want my mood to be stable, so that I'm not the haphaphappiest motherfucker one day and then spend the next three months curled up in a ball in my room hating life. I want stability in my personal and romantic relationships, not all the uncertainty of secretly suicidal moms and going back and forth between loving my relationship and the independence it affords me and being so heartsick that I can't sleep.

Within the last year or so it has become much worse. When i'm down I can never work properly, I will avoid seeing my parents in evenings, I will generally not give a shit about anything, thinking of death ALL the time, mainly thinking about people I love dying and how I don't think I could handle it at all, and that surely it would be better if I killed myself. I think at least twice in the last year the only thing stopping me from killing myself was thinking about how sad it would make the people I love if I did. When I am down, I will always think of ways I might kill myself. It's really random. For example I will be cutting vegetables and I will fleetingly imagine myself stabbing myself. Or I will be plugging something into a socket and I will just think for a second ""I hope this electrocutes me"". An accidental death seems like an easy way out.. right? All these things I have detailed are getting worse as time goes on. It is getting to the point at which I am kind of scared of myself in a way. If something bad were to happen in my life, I genuinely think it could lead me to killing myself.

Anyway, recently I confided in my parents about this. I had originally not wanted to (they are doctors and I thought they might just dismiss it as stress or something) but talking to a friend and reddit persuaded me to tell them. I originally said that I was going to make a GP appointment and that they couldn't stop me. However I talked to my dad (technically has a psychology degree and sometimes works with depressed patients), and basically told him everything. He said that he thought it could have some 'cause' (eg exam stress) and that I might just be pointlessly medicalised and that in the UK doctors were very weary of diagnosing mental health issues in young people as opposed to other places (eg the US) and that we should try to change our lifestyle a bit instead. I have tried this. I have been going to bed earlier, socialising with them in the evenings more, cooking more, eating more healthily blahblah. It hasnt helped. I have felt so shit recently.. I have had a week's holiday and yet I have done none of my work. I have done nothing at all. The only reason I have actually bothered getting up and eating is because it's easier than arguing with my parents. I have just stayed in my room listening to depressing music, reading depressing books and doing fucking nothing. I don't see any bright light at all.. after I told my parents I thought something might be done.. but it isnt going to. I am also waiting to hear back from uni's to see if they are giving me a place. I've applied to medicine and so have to wait longer than most people, so it doesn't help that my friends are getting offers to their courses. I had a kind of inkling that I might kill myself if I got rejected from all 3 unis, but I dont know if I actually would.. I have put in so much fucking effort over the last two years and if it comes to nothing then I dont know what I will do..

If you have read all that then I thank you from the bottom of my heart. Knowing I have people who I can open up to and who won't judge me is one of the only things keeping me going.

Its just that sometimes I feel really really lonely and I just want someone to take an interest in being my friend, ya know? I'm at a big university, and I am in a sorority. Last semester, I made a lot of acquaintances this way but I just couldn't ever take it to the next level and actually become friends with anyone. Over the break, I told myself that this semester would be different and that I was going to make new friends, but it just seems like everyone already has friends and they just don't want to be friends with me. What is so wrong with me that I cant make friends?

To make matters worse, my boyfriend is at another university six hours away. He is very similar to me in that he doesn't have a ton of friends, but at least our friends from high school are close enough for him to visit. I tried searching how long of a drive it would be for me to go visit some of them and it just seems that my school is about six hours from everywhere. I feel like I've isolated myself, and now I'm alone and sad. I love my university. It is totally perfect for me, but I just feel really alone right now.

My parents are really loving and supportive, but sometimes they can be very judgmental. For example, they've decided that they don't like my boyfriend because they think he doesn't fit in with them, even though they always have a great time with him when we're all together. So that also makes it really hard because I feel like I'm not making them proud of me. They always talk to me saying that I don't seem happy, but that just makes me even more upset because again I'm disappointing them.

He seemed like a pretty cool dude, we talked for a while and eventually I added him to my friends list on Steam. The next day, he started talking to me again; we chatted about our interests, what we were up to, just generally talking. Over the next couple of weeks, we became closer and closer, and we eventually became pretty good friends, and that meant I was there for him. His cheerful attitude was nothing more than a mask; he was actually severely depressed and even frightened at times, although he never mentioned why. Naturally, I did what I could to help him.

One day, he finally told me; long story short, he lived in a shithole with  his mother, a prostitute who constantly abused him. It had been this way ever since he was little, and now, at the age of 16, he was working 2 jobs and skipping school to be able to pay the rent, with no help from anyone else. I saw that he was lonely and broken, having grown up basically in hell on earth, and naturally I did my best to cheer him up. I played with him online whenever I got the chance to, talked about the possibility of meeting up IRL (although that never happened), comforted him when he told me about how his mum had beaten him up. It wasn't anything light, either; he'd apparently suffered from broken bones, being beaten unconscious, and all sorts of horrible things.

As the weeks turned into months, he got worse and worse, being too depressed to get out of bed, rarely playing games anymore, and constantly mentioning the idea of suicide. He'd tried it many times before I met him, apparently, and every time he mentioned it I did my best to talk him out of it. Time passed, and the New Year came. He grew ever more distant from me and all his friends, saying only a few words before logging out. I thought he was just busy, or something. I should have read the signs.

Suddenly, he completely changed his profile. He removed his screen name, got rid of his display picture, and changed his profile to say only one word: ""I'm sorry"".

That was 3 days ago. He hasn't been online since. We've all been posting words of encouragement on his profile, begging him to come back, but with no response. He hasn't answered his phone in over a week, and he changed his voice mail to say the same thing: ""I'm sorry"".

We're all worried sick about him. We're fearing the worst has happened. I've never had to deal with something like this before.

My ex (technically still my husband) dumped me about 8 months ago, out of the blue, and I thought it was the last straw. Why go on? It was obvious how completely unlovable I am.

I met this dude in 92, I was twelve. HIs name was Ross and I fell in love with him like woah. He was a little older than me. We dated for a while, and when we broke up it hurt like nothing I had ever felt before. We met up again in 95 and then 96, and countless times after that. He lived in Boston, and I lived in CT but we would bump into eachother every couple of years, fall in love all over again, infuriate each other, **Love** each other, laugh with each other, hold each other, and for some reason or another, move on. I had his name tattooed on me when I figured out how to do homemade tattoos. I covered it up after one of those breakups (with some terrible butterfly that looked more like a moth), and eventually got the whole thing removed. You can still see it faintly though.

We met up many times over the years. He was my on again, off again for over fifteen years. 

I don't think we have **one**... soulmate, for lack of a better word. I think we have many. I've had friends of the same sex that I feel were soulmates. I think people come and go into your life to learn something, or to teach you something. I took for granted the fact that I always reconnected with him. 

The last time we found each other, on myspace (go ahead, LOL), I told him I still remembered his phone # from when we first met, he was amused. I still remember it today, 19 years later. We talked almost every night. He said sweet things when my dog, one of the great loves of my life, died. He wanted me to come see him so he could hold me. He didn't want me to be sad. 

He asked me to come see him for my birthday, in March. I toyed with the idea, and **really ,really** wanted to!  I checked the train schedule. I fantasized about it. I hadn't seen him in a couple years, so it seemed about right. 

We began arguing over the phone all the time. He would get drunk and project all this anger onto me. I would say ""Hey baby"" and he would respond ""Why are you always so angry!?! You're still mad about that thing I did ten years ago, aren't you!??!"" He drank Jameson like water at this point. He was always *face wasted* at an increasing rate which became daily. He only wanted to argue. He would yell that I slept with other people... ever, I didn't care about him if I wouldn't make the effort to come see him, everything was a lie! I would hear other chicks in the background and he would tell me what he was going to do to them. We had an argument. We both screamed and yelled. 

We had yet **another** fight. He didn't call me back. I decided to reinvent myself. I ended up getting a rescue Boxer just a few weeks later, and I took over the role of Mamma, again. I figured we would meet up again like we always do. I missed him tremendously, but I had been through that so many times with him that I thought I would just roll with the punches and be fine. We would meet each other again in the future, and repeat. 

 I'm going to Boston in a couple weeks, and thought it would be amazing to meet him for a drink or ten. In typical me and him fashion, I thought I would find him and send him a message, we would meet up, hug and be happy.

Today I learned that he died soon after our last conversation. It could actually be that he didn't call back the next day because he was dead. He died in 2009 and I'm only today finding out. I have one less soulmate on this planet. Even though we were so erratic, he was my constant erratic person. I'm 31 now, I've had him in my life one way or another since I was 12. 

I'm only today finding out that he's gone.

You don't have to read this, and I doubt anyone will, but I just want to rant.

Today, at school, my friend H* started crying during recess. Considering that it happened on a playground, most people would probably think that she fell off of a swing or something similar. But that's not what happened. In actuality, she had a breakdown. She revealed to me, E, and a few other friends, that she's been cutting herself because of anxieties about her boyfriend A. After this, E revealed that she's had a drinking problem for three months. Next week marks her one month sober. She's thirteen. The worst part is that I have a secret that I've never told anybody.

I hate myself. I find myself absolutely disgusting. Sometimes I turn on the shower on as hot as it gets and I stand under it just because it hurts. I've never gotten as far as cutting myself, but I want someone to help me before it gets that far. I hate feeling like I need to be helped, so I push people away when they try to help. My worst fear and my greatest wish is for someone to find out about this. I don't want to feel so insecure, and I want someone to help me keep myself together. I feel too conflicted. I cry myself to sleep some nights. Actually, most nights.

I don't know the last time that I felt happy. My whole life has been one big act, and I can't take any more. The only problem is, if I get rid of the mask that I use my whole life, who will I be?

Over the last couple of years all of them have either become married or have recently had kids. I'm happy for them. But eventually, nobody wants to do anything anymore.

I miss that old life. We weren't getting hammered or being stupid. Just getting drinks and talking. I feel like I don't have any friends anymore. I miss it.

I was relapsing (not in the way that you'd think) into a negative mindset. I was thinking.. well I don't have close female friends. I'd just fall into the same cycle- i'd get rejected a lot, or i'd find someone nice and then.. after a while, I'd get forgotten, or replaced, or suddenly I'm not important or worth talking to anymore. I'd fade away from someone's thoughts. I'm sure at least a few guys have this problem, but this post doesn't apply to just them. It applies to anyone that is having trouble letting go of their past friends, or people that used to matter to them.

I was thinking of a few female friends, that I'd drifted apart from. People **knew** that, when I got depressed over this.. it'd be all i'd think about. I wouldn't necessarily, vent and explode or be an oozing puddle of sadness.. but the friends or people that i was on good terms with, would notice. And I know, please believe me I know- its hard. Its hard to let go, because you remember people, as they were- how they were so kind to you, how they used to be- and thats great that they were. 

But **if you keep holding on to what the past was, you might.. blind yourself from (ever) realizing what you have right in front of you**:

Either people that still legitimately care and want your company, or meeting such people-

So on the way to work, when I was thinking this- I wrote this on tumblr as a reminder to myself. To look at it whenever I really do.. wander down that path in my thoughts. And I'd like to share it with you guys here at MMFB. If you need time, take it. But it doesn't mean you have to be alone when you do. The real friends you have, won't mind. I dont know if you've heard the somewhat common phrase

**“Those who mind don’t matter and those who matter don’t mind.”**

I wholeheartedly agree. I don't necessarily know if I got a clear coherent point across here, but maybe I can sum it up here- you're never truly alone- I'm positive that someone, somewhere feels your pain, and would be there for you- be it an already existing friend, or someone that could and would talk to you about it- in real life, online, tumblr, or here on reddit- and without further ado here's my note to myself that I called at the time, ""No, Ryan..""

&gt;Don’t do this again. You’ve been doing so well the past week. You cheered up, you remembered what real friends you have

&gt;Please don’t think of the bad.. Thank them for the memories. For not leaving you alone back then. But things have changed, and they’re not the same. Those people are gone.

&gt;You deserve (and have) friends that are willing to show you that they are here to stay and keep you away from that hell called loneliness forever more.

&gt;You’re worth more, than what the bad memories are making you feel like. Everyone’s been telling you this. And i agree. I believe in you.

&gt;You have so much care and love to give to your friends. its been showing, constantly. and they’re only happy to be there for you.

1373697438.0,23,self.MMFB,1i7g6v,My mom died; please help.,24,1,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/1i7g6v/my_mom_died_please_help/,"My mom died less than 2 months ago after over 7 years of battling cancer, including the relapse about 3 years ago that eventually did cause her death. I find it very hard now to remember her as she was before cancer, but the more recent memories are burned into my brain and so I try not to think about them at all. That's not how she was and that's not how I want to remember her.

My mom was my best friend, and I mean that with all my heart. I feel like now there's nobody I can talk to, since my dad's in the same if not worse shape than I am. Everyone keeps saying 'if we can help...' but I don't want anyone's help, I want my mom. And she's never going to come back and I haven't dealt with that at all and I don't know what to do.

I hate myself... how I look, I'm morbidly obese, I'm not really attractive, I'm gullible and naive and way too nice for my own good and it's gotten me screwed over by people before. By the same point I worry - a lot - that I'm not nice enough or that people think I'm mean or distant. I'm really, really introverted and for the past ... probably 5 years or so I spend upwards of 12 hours (usually closer to 15 or more) hours on the computer, playing games or reading or screwing around. 

I'm also scared to death about developing diabetes - I'm apparently pre-diabetic - but I have a very, very hard time with doctors or hospitals, and a bad experience with the dietician I DID go to a few years ago. I never went with my mom to chemo, or to see people in a hospital because I just cannot be there. The last few days of my mom's life she was in a care facility and we pretty much lived there.

I'm not sure if this is relevant but my 17-year-old cat died a couple of years ago, and well, she wasn't litter-trained at all - see the part later about my house - but I would really like to get a puppy though I've been putting that off. And I keep coming up with excuses about waiting 'til we move - which is pretty much true - but really it's because I'm not in a good space and I don't want to fuck up another creature's life like mine is, or be petty.

I've been having trouble sleeping for about a year as well, usually just going to bed really late (3-4am), and then I sleep in 'til noon. I used to get up around 5 every morning so this has really shifted me around. I sleep alright once I force myself to bed, but I get tons of headaches, probably because I'm on the computer so much.

It's slightly easier when I'm hanging around with friends but being introverted I find that being around people - even people I love, my friends really are wonderful - is very, very draining on what little energy I can muster up anyway. And then when I'm alone again I go back into the same state of not caring about anything. And I'm really really good at putting up masks and pretending I'm okay so nobody's really noticed.

When my mom passed everyone kept telling me that I had to be strong for my dad, and even he says that he doesn't know how he would be doing if it wasn't for me holding him up... And he has said since then that I don't have to be strong, that I can cry and whatever and I have but I don't really feel like it's okay still. I just feel... numb, all the time. Sad or angry, but that's kind of muted.

I am lucky in that I have the money and the time to go to school and not have to work, but there is literally nothing right now that I'm even mildly interested in. I've been to post-secondary twice now and quit due to lack of interest... grades were fine, had A's or A+'s through all years. I just don't care about anything enough. Even projects I try to start, I'm really, REALLY gung-ho - like dedicating 6 hours at least a day for the first 3-4 days - and then I just lose all interest and stop doing them. 

And our house is falling apart - both cleanliness and literally actually falling, there's a nice leak in my bedroom right now - and we're wanting to move but I'm so afraid nothing's actually going to happen and we'll still be stuck in this rotten, horrible place where everywhere I look I'm reminded of my mom. My cat used to use the house as a litter box, essentially, and my parents never got the carpets cleaned or anything. And my mom used to deal with all the financial stuff and it kind of got foisted on me just so that we'd actually PAY the bills but I can't even get up the energy or the... 'caring' to do them, so everything gets done last minute.

And I'm really furious at myself and sort of at my parents... they've joked for years that they're both procrastinators, and that I got a double-dose of procrastination from them... but it's TRUE and I put things off and off and get yelled at and promise to fix things but I never do, and I want to blame them for never setting a decent example but how can I? It's still ME who is NOT doing things.

Don't know if it matters at all but I'm female, early-to-mid twenties. If you've lost someone or dealt with this feeling before please, please tell me what to do. Something. I don't know.

Specific examples (sorry for the rushed formatting, I'm really upset right now) - he told me that the blueberries and blackberries would go bad, and that he'd bought them for me because he knew I liked them, so hurry up and eat them. He says this all very aggressively. I'm not sure how else to describe it. No big deal, right? I told him to calm down, you bought them two days ago, they're fine, I'll eat 'em. He goes rigid. I know I'm in trouble now. That was a pretty stupid thing for me to say, because 1) he hates being told to calm down, and 2) he was already very angry with me for ""treating your parents like crap"" (which, please believe me, I do not). He walks away for a second, and I breathe a bit, but he comes back a minute later, demanding that I hand over my phone. I should have just given it to him. But this happens every goddamn weekend, so I refuse. Besides, he has to go (he works out of state, and I only see him on weekends, thank God). So he starts spraying spit on my face because he won't stop *actually* screaming at me in front of my grandparents, who don't do anything to stop it. He moves between the door and the chair in front of me restlessly, never letting up in his threats of cutting my phone service. Stupid thing number two I do - I tell him to go right ahead. He's getting louder and louder now, if that's possible, and I finally tell him ""this happens every fucking weekend"". I know I've killed my cause then. When I tell him to stop screaming in front of his parents, he says *what did you just say* (this is him completely ignoring the fact that he swore at me not two minutes ago, too). So. I know I sound like your typical sullen, rebellious teenager, but please, please, *please* trust me when I say that my tone of voice is a lot more civil than his, and I usually attempt to reason with him (unsurprisingly, this never works). I guess I'd had it then, evidenced by my behavior (which I am not proud of). But this man has terrorized everybody in my family at one point or another. He's beat my mother, my brother (not so much here), and myself, he's called me lots of unkind names, he's told me I'm a failure, he's threatened to pull me out of school, he's threatened to kick me out, he's punished (and continues to punish) me unreasonably, he will not listen, he takes offense to the most random gestures, he becomes this *monster* when he's angry - I can't stand him. When he opens the door Friday night and enters my life for three days, I can't stop feeling this churning uneasiness in the pit of my stomach. I guess my mother submits to him, but she can be pretty harsh with me and my siblings. Still, she tries not to do anything to upset him. I hate it. We all have to tiptoe around him, just because he has the nastiest temper I've ever seen. And the most infuriating thing is, whenever he tells us our punishment, he *laughs*. He chuckles this self-satisfied chuckle, like we're really getting it now. God fucking dammit. I can't stand the man. I lost all respect for him a long time ago. I appreciate everything he does - working out of state must take a huge toll on him - but I know fathers who work just as hard who don't hurt their families this way.

1365173456.0,24,self.MMFB,1bqhla,I just woke up from a dream about someone I loved and will never see again...,26,2,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/1bqhla/i_just_woke_up_from_a_dream_about_someone_i_loved/,"This is tough to type out. Stream of consciousness ahead.

I'm one of those people who forms really, really deep attachments when I care for someone. I take a very long time to get over breakups and failed relationships. This is a problem, for sure, but being an adult means managing your problems and I do so. Most of the time it's fine.

Today doesn't seem to be one of those ""most of the time"" days. I woke up about an hour ago from a dream about a particularly strong attachment who is now gone. The details don't really matter. They're gone, completely.

Once in a while you meet someone who manages to punch through any sort of logic or rational thought and just draws you to them -- inexplicably and completely. If you're lucky, your instincts are wired correctly and getting close to them is a good idea. If you're even luckier, the sentiment is mutual. Long story short: neither of those were true for this situation. 

And you do what nature makes you do in that situation -- you try anyway, and you fail, and it hurts worse than most things you'll ever experience, but the pull was so strong that deep down you know you'll never regret it.

And then you wake up ages later and you have that dream where the two of you are standing in Grandma's kitchen and you're cooking a simple meal because that's what was on hand, and the two of you are talking and tell them you've missed them and you've wondered if they were well and you ask them to stay in touch, no strings attached and no expectations, and you completely mean it and you know you mean it, and you can tell by their polite smile that they don't trust that you mean it and don't want to get caught up in you again, but you choose to interpret that as a maybe anyway because the moment is so perfect, just to behold and observe and hear that voice again -- intuition and futility be damned, you're going to enjoy this meal and this time together while it's here.

And then you wake up, and they're gone. And you sit with the day off work, every image fresh in your mind, the memory of the voice clearer than ever, and you choke back a tear while you look at an old picture and you know that they aren't an email or a phone call or a facebook message or a letter or even a road trip away anymore. They're gone. So much left unsaid. You say to yourself ""all I ever wanted was to resolve this and make it feel complete"", but of course that's a lie. You want to embrace, to press your face against theirs, and to stay there until your last heartbeat passes and that's the last moment you'll ever experience.

You know what to do. You know you have to put it aside. You have a whole day to live. The sun is bright, it's warm, the birds are singing. You have friends and family and people who love you, and you have only limited time with them, too. You should go to them. You should have lunch with the people who make you laugh. You should make that simple meal in your dream, but make it huge, and call everyone you care about and bring them to your table and celebrate life and friendship. You should take a drive or a hike or a ride or a walk and remind yourself of the whole world out there for you to discover. You should let the things around you now be the most important things in your world, the way you've chosen that they would be.

But...they aren't the most important, are they? Not today. Today it's the one you left behind. And your mind and your heart have made that decision for you. You don't get a say in it. And you can feel the anger on both sides, welling up inside you. The part of you who gave you that dream resents you. It feels cheated that you won't embrace what you've lost and go find that person. It doesn't understand that you can't, and you feel guilty for cheating it. The part of you who knows better resents you, too. It knows you should have more control. You're better than this. You've shed enough tears. You're a grown man, be in control of yourself.

And then in the back of your mind is the voice of experience. He knows that tomorrow, you'll feel better and it'll fade into memory like everything does. And he's the one who cries.

Because she really deserves more, don't you think?

Of course, I talked myself out of it, mostly because of a sudden fear of heights/being unable to find a building without a guard rail.
I called them the next day, and said I was sorry but I had some phone/personal issues and the secretary took a message, which apparently said something about me QUITTING. So I cam to work that night and they said I had told them I had quit. Well, they were busy that day, so they said to come in on Sunday and we'd talk it out.
They called me just a few minutes ago saying that they'd have to let me go because of 'the policy' and that htye had just let antoher girl go before me for the same reason, and if the first girl found out they had used the policy in my favor or something, then she'd take it up to the HR and that wouldn't be good on the store.

Now she is back and we are picking up the pieces. I'm getting very mixed signals, so last night I got drunk and phone snooped, and found out she's having sex with a co-worker who has a gf himself.


So I'm not feeling too good. Here's the background info.

I'm a 21 year old guy. My ex is 19, and we started dating four years ago back in high school. We only just recently broke up at the end of September, so we have been dating for a loooong time. We were talking about marriage and we even got an apartment together with 2 other mutual friends. We both were attending the same college, until she decided to join the guard to pay for school. 

She went to basic training, and when that was over she flew me out to see her graduate, then she went to tech school. We could skype and talk on the phone and text as much as we wanted, but soon she became more and more distant. She had made some friends with some very wild girls (she is usually more the socially awkward type) and started drinking and partying on the weekends with all of the new guys and girls she had met. Long story short, she became so distant, and I became so irritated by that, that we decided to break up and maybe try to pick up the pieces when she got back. 

She got back a little over a month ago, and since then we have hung out a few times. She is living with her parents instead of living in the apartment we got together, but thankfully she still pays her rent. After the first few dates I was getting mixed signals from her, so I told her ""I still have feelings for you, and you don't have to tell me how you feel about me, but I just want to know if I'm barking up the wrong tree or not"", and she said she didn't know how she felt, but that she still wants to hang out.

When we hang out, its nice and flirty, and we kiss when she leaves. When we hang out and drink, we make out and she crashes at my place in my bed. We spoon and stuff, but we have not had sex since she has been back. It has left me very confused, but I figured maybe she just wants to take it really slow. My more recent thoughts however are that there is another guy that she went to tech school with that works at the same base as she does now. It's a horrible feeling, and the mixed signals are so painful to endure from some one I cared so much about, that every time we part I never want to see her again, and I want to move on. It's almost impossible to get over her though when she comes over and makes out with me and sleeps next to me once or twice a week.

So just last night we went to a party together and made out a little and what not, and then came back to my apartment and fell asleep next to each other. She had left her phone on my nightstand, and being a little drunk, I saw it as an opportunity to get some answers, so I went through her texts. I know I know. Never a good thing to do, but I wanted to know what was going on here.   

I really didn't want to do it. I don't want to be that guy that sneakily goes through her phone, but I'm dying here. So I go through her phone and read the long conversation between the guy I suspected and her. It's exactly as I suspected. 

First off, the guy has a girlfriend, and from where the conversation starts, she is saying, stuff like ""I know you have a girlfriend, so I'll let you make all the moves"" and ""I don't want to be the bad guy here"". Then she goes on to say things like (damn this is hard to type) ""I want to have sex again, but that probably depends on how things are with your girlfriend"" and ""That was the best sex of my life"" and ""you have a nice body"". He says stuff like ""Hey you should come early so we can have sex"", and ""I was just thinking about how I want my dick in you again"". One particularly stabbing segment was when, apparently they hadn't had sex in awhile, and she claimed to be having sex with me again in what looked like an attempt to get some jealousy thing going on or something. She referred to it as ""lazy sex""

At one point, he says ""Every time I have sex without choking something I die a little inside"", and she responds ""Every time I have lazy sex I die a little inside"". So fuck, he chokes her when they have sex too. I had done that here and there when we used to be together, but I was never very comfortable with it. It is something she likes I guess.

In a conversation with another co-worker, the guy asked ""so did you and (a totally different guy) do the dirty last night?"" and she replied ""Why don't you ask him? I'm more private when I'm sober"". So it sounds like shes had sex with 2 guys since she's been back.

All of these texts were dated 12 days ago, and she hadn't spoken with any of them since then, except for early yesterday. Today is the first day she actually can go work on the base (which is an hour and a half away), and he has an apartment down there, so It's the first time she will be in his area. She said ""I finally get to come work tomorrow"" and they made plans to go get burgers.

I hate the feeling I have right now. I wish I could just forget her and move on, but I can't. Her parents are going to pay me some very much needed money to help them with a house they are building, and she invited me to thanksgiving and a concert. I wish we could still be together, but I feel like I'm being dragged along by this monster she has turned into. I just want to do the work for her parents, get the money, and then never talk to her again.

No surprise should come here, but this is a throwaway account. Also, this isn't really intended to be too much of a story of my medical history(wikipedia and WebMD are still up as of the time of this writing), but I will answer those queries.

Also, apologies if some of this jumps around or seems convoluted. A few of the things in my post...I've never even told to people online, let alone family or friends. And I think I've lied to myself on a number of them, also.

Basically, this post exists because I need to vent. And if talking it through helps me out, then added bonus. I feel as if I'm at an impasse in my life, due to my 'secret' condition. I'm in my early 30's, and I don't feel as if I'm a Forever Aloner-type, but I definitely have an insane, almost crippling fear of intimacy. 

I've never gotten past first base, despite a number of chances. I feel no need to. I imagine it'd only be a mix of humiliation and frustration. During the first part of my 'adulthood', it was almost not a problem, as being a young, single, workaholic/alcoholic chap is pretty much acceptable in your 20's. I'm somewhat charismatic in social settings, so a few eyebrows have been raised when I don't bring a date to events/weddings/etc...

As such, most of my experience with women comes on a friendship level. It's possible I've been 'friend-zoned',(although some of these girls are like long-lost sisters to me) but I never felt that way. I literally felt like that was my only option. As far as dating and potentially marriage is concerned? Well, I'm literally too much of a chicken shit to really try it. I know a lot of people can envision their lives without a partner, without raising a family, but I really have trouble doing that. These are things that I want, but I'm scared(yes, I'm a chickenshit) that it won't happen for me. I'm scared that I won't find a mate that can have a relationship with zero physical contact.

After asking me to find her keys (she was always losing them), I went into the bedroom and tossed them to her. This caused her to EXPLODE, taking some swings at me (I've trained in the martial arts for about 10 years now), and I told her to leave, hoping that she would go sleep it off at her friend's house. Once again she exploded, swinging at me, biting (she even fell and went after my crotch), and so I had to physically remove her from our house. The police were called, so I made arrangements to be bailed out if need be (in my state the man is usually arrested in domestic dispute calls) and sat on the stoop outside. The police showed up, handcuffed me and her, and after interviewing/interrogating us both they released me and asked if I wanted to press charges. I told them that not only did I not want to press charges but I wouldn't show up as a witness for any trial, so they let her leave with our friend.

Edit: I really did, and still do love her.

Edit_2: I'm going to try to keep answering until she's finished leaving, and maybe slightly afterward. I've never opened myself up in public like this before, &amp; y'all really are helping.

New Development: She's bringing her ex-con brother-in-law to help her pack &amp; move.

New Development 2: So she's not coming to pack on Friday &amp; moving on Saturday. She just sent me a text message to tell me that she's packing on Saturday &amp; moving on Sunday.

New Development 3: She's here now packing her stuff up. She brought her father &amp; her sister (the ex-con's wife); the ex-con didn't show up. None of them have said a word to me the entire time they've been here. 

I find it funny that people that once considered me a member of their family aren't even asking my version of what happened, but I guess they are their own family. Nobody seems too angry - whether they are avoiding the conversation or assume that there was some craziness involved I'm not sure of. At least it's been quiet.

When I got back to college, I was banned from the frat where all my friends would go because of some vague incident that I don't remember (apparently I rudely pushed past a brother, who happened to be president). I got used to spending my saturday nights alone, dreading the moment when my roommate would walk through the door and see me in my shame. Next year at college was mostly the same, but my new roommate was almost never around. I started smoking weed about once a week to help with my insomnia (an hour before bed time or so), but this quickly became every day, and then in between class or whenever I had a couple hours to spare. My grades started to drop too, and I had to drop a few classes just to stay afloat. Flash forward to senior year, and things have deteriorated predictably. I spend almost all my free time in my room (single this time), getting high and watching tv/playing video games, I've skipped more classes this semester than all my past semesters combined (I'm going to be failing at least 1 class) and I have no social life. Most of the time for dinner I get fast food and sneak it into my room in my backpack (to hide my shame). I've probably spent thousands of dollars on weed over the past three years, some of it mine, some of it my parents which they trusted me to spend on food and essentials. Now, I'm going to be graduating college late with a terrible GPA (2.7) and I'm overwhelmed by guilt and regret. I hate what I've allowed myself to become, which is a drug abuser that epitomizes apathy and laziness. I'm so ashamed of what my parents would think if they knew how I lived, how little fun I've had in college, how poorly I apply myself. I can't stop thinking about all the wasted opportunities and aspirations that I've ruined, and it's really messing me up. Any advise or solace people could offer would go a long way for me, these are the type of things that I've never said to anyone I know because I always pretend that everything is OK on the outside, so sorry if it's a bit rambling",,False,,t5_2sjdn,False,,,True,t3_n8i7c,http://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/n8i7c/an_addiction_ive_always_denied/,

I'd made some decent money as a teen, graduated high school a few years early, went to college, drove a functional car, and things were pretty good overall.

Last year I was arrested for attempted purchase of a 20$ bag of coke.  Ever since then my life has been horrible.  Jail was a humiliating and terrifying experience for someone who'd never been in that sort of atmosphere before.  It carried a unique and degrading sense of powerlessness that seriously rocked my self esteem and left me with ongoing anxiety.  I guess I'm registered in some sort of system now, since I'm constantly being pulled over and harassed by cops.  I had to drop out of school because my anxiety got too bad.  The state attorney's prosecutor won't be happy until I'm in prison and a convicted felon.  My only offer is 3 years probation.

I've never stolen anything, or hurt anyone.  I'm not violent.  I've done tons of community service.  I'm an engineer in the medical industry.  I make alright money.  I was a DARE graduate.  I got to meet the president when I was in high school.  I'm not a drug addict and I've never sold anything.  I'm really not sure why the government is so keen on ruining my life.  I was going to be a doctor.  I don't understand how a criminal is preferable.

If probation just meant to stay out of trouble, don't do drugs, and don't get arrested again, then fine, I could manage that.  But if I went on probation they would have to call my job, which I would lose, and my landlord, who would evict me.  They would have to call every potential employer I found.  I have to PAY a monthly fee to be on probation, and if I don't, it can be a violation.  So they take away my means of making money, charge money, and then if I can't pay, I go to prison for two years.  I've already blown $20,000 trying to fight this.  Also I'm not supposed to consume alcohol or be at any establishment that serves alcohol.  And that's what, every restaurant sans Dennys?

When I was going to school I had so many scholarships that I'd get money back for every semester I went.  If I get convicted, I lose it all.

Attempted suicide counts as a violation of probation.

I used to believe in this country.

I don't have parents to turn to.  I've tried writing letters and contacting all of the state politicians, but I can't even get any on the phone.  I just enter adulthood and it's already all messed up.  I'm not a bad person, the governments trying to take away everything I have, and I'm in some pretty dire need of rescuing.  If anyone's buddies with someone in the Florida state government, help a sister out.

just decided not to commit suicide this December. 
MMFB",29,5,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/ikx0v/iama_recovering_21_year_old_hikikomori_virgin_who/,"This is my first post on Reddit so I'm not sure what to do and I apologise for the length but anyway, . . .

I have been a hikikomori for 3 years, since I was 19. Before that I was a shut in and played WoW for 2-3 years, when I was 14-16/17.

I tried to go to college in those 2 years but failed miserably, dropped out 3 times, screwed up my life and have been locked in here ever since. I am a very weak person.

I have under 5 friends. One I consider a friend but have only known for a few weeks. The other 4, I either don't like or don't feel liked enough by. All of them online. I haven't had a real life friend for over 3 years. 

I am/was pretty hardcore. More so than the protagonist of ""Welcome to the NHK"" but not as bad as ""Me-Teru no Kimochi"", but close.

My door is always locked. I didn't talk to anybody and always left notes outside my door. I only left my room at night or when I was sure that no one was home. I drilled 3 holes in my door that allowed me to spy on the outside hallway. I had a 'water system' for intake and passing of water. I still do all of these things. Except the water system, which is mostly abolished. Mostly.

I was planning to commit suicide this December via hypothermia (I had it all planned) and lived a year of my life believing I was a dead person sitting. I honestly believe I am too weak and unwanted to exist in this world. I was going to be kicked out (I have relatives in prison who will be coming out shortly and I fear for my life) and did not have an ounce of hope that I could continue living. 


I decided to 'recover' but it is hard and I don't know what to do. I'm very scared of the future. I went job hunting today with no luck because I don't know what to do.


To be honest I may resort to suicide again.

Please make me feel better.

She is infatuated with me and she'll kill herself if I break up with her.,26,2,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/1jdjv7/i_have_to_break_up_with_a_girl_who_lives_6_hours/,"Here's what happened, keep in mind i'm 16 and I have Aspergers syndrome and anxiety disorder.

This girl on Instagram liked all my pictures, put a lot of compliments on my selfies, and left me her number. I texted her and she said that I was really cute and that I'm a great photographer and artist. We started flirting a little.

I like her, not in a romantic way though. She lives 6 hours away from me.

2 weeks later she texts me again in a flirty tone and we started flirting like crazy. She even said she wanted to fuck me. Here's where things go downhill.

She said that I saved her life with all the quotes I post on Instagram, and that she was about to kill herself. She said she loved me and asked me to marry me. I said yes, well cause.... well actually I don't know I'm fucking stupid. I didn't think she meant it. My friends tell me they love me all the time. 
  
2 days later she made a big long text. She said that I was the best guy she has ever met. That I'm The One for her. That I'm the only source of happiness in her life. That she hopes one day we'll meet and be together forever and ever. That she need never wants to lose me, and if she does she'll die.

This scared the shit out of me. I didn't know this was a relationship. We have never had a real conversation. Only flirting. We barely know each other. She has no idea what my personality is really like. How the fuck does she love me? All she's feeling is infatuation and lust.

At this point I should have told her that I didn't know she meant it. But I didnt. I went too far. Cause I'm a fucking dumbass.

2 weeks later, we sexted on snapchat. She sent me a pic of her topless. I knew this was going too far, but it would've been rude to break up with her then. To make it up to her I sent her pics of my chest. She showed her tits more. She asked if I had a boner. I said I did and she told me to jack off for her. And I did. And we did this 3 times.

I feel fucking awful. I went too far. I ABSOLUTELY FUCKING LOVE that a girl likes my dick. and I couldn't control myself. 

I have to break up with her. I have to get away from her. But I'm afraid she'll kill her herself. I don't want the feeling that I killed someone. I'm afraid that her parents will go through her phone and find me in her texts. I don't want the police to come after me. (Would they?) How do I handle this? I can't ignore her texts forever.

I have a break up letter written for her, ready to send. I'll post it in the comments.

Anyway,on with the story.I know this gir-WOMAN(Im 34,shes 32) we will call her Michelle for purposes of the story.Ive known her for about 5 years,hadnt seen her for the better part of 2,and had been thinking about her around christmas of last year,and we reconnected randomly a couple months ago.We used to live in the same apartment complex and became really close.She got pregnant shortly after we met,and was going the single mom routeAt the time I was going thru a terrible break up with my fiancee' and she was there for me in the way of a distraction,some comfort and affection,but it was never sexual.More int he way of just hanging out,taking her to work/dr appointments,tot he store,etc.We would smoke herb,eat food,watch tv.At one time I wanted it to be more but she more or less made it clear it wasnt happening.

She moved out,in with family,had her baby,lost her baby (to relatives,due to her addictions and lifestyle,not death)and more or less turned into somewhat of a fuck up,while I graduated college,found a job,lost some weight,but am still working on getting over my ex,getting my self confidence back and everything else,yet living a lonely ass non social life due to the nature of my work,which was impeding the last part.

The last time I saw michelle,she came to my former apartment before I had moved out,beating on my door at 7 am in the morning,ringing the door bell,yelling my name,obviously wearing down from an all night drunk and God knows what else fest.I had already told her i had no desire to be around her when she was drinking due to several earlier incidents that involved unnecessary drama and me babysitting her.

SO she comes in,and says,""i just got raped,wheres your pot?""

I said ""what the fuck are you talking about?""

And she goes on to tell me in a cool,calm collected fashion how she went out with these two dudes she just met and got really wasted and was having fun with them but then things got ugly and she wanted to stop and they didnt and they took advantage of her.

As I am listening to her story,im thinking about all the morons she has fucked since Ive known her.The random guys out and about,the guy from the club that she brought home one night and let impregnate her, random myspace hookups while pregnant,the one I walked in on at her place that drove from three counties over just to fuck,the fact that I was almost a random hookup because the first night I met her she was drunk on her balcony and saw me carry out garbage with a beer in my hand (the rare occasion that i drink) and invited me in with her roommate and a little strip tease action started and this was back when I still had a girlfriend and a conscious so I got up and left,and kicked myself for it ever since,but I digress..

Sp while shes rambling on about her night,I'm stewing ont he fact that she has just barged into my house at 7 am unnanounced,and smoking the last bit of my weed and i wasnt sure when I would get more.Not to mention the blatant disregard for MY roommate,when things were already getting bad between us.I was also stewing on all that I had done for her,and practically been a great boyfreind,and reaped none of the benefits,plus everyone telling me (my roommate,my freinds,other neighbors,)that she was just using me for pot and transportation.

So I told her it was best if she left.I told her she came over unannounced and drunk,when I dont like her drunk,with no disregard for no one but herself and just looking to get a buzz to keep the party going.I also told her she just smoked the last bit of weed i had and was saving it for later in the day when I got done doing some shit i had to do,and she just helped herself to it.She said a few choice words,mainly questioned our friendship,and left.

I decided to take it to facebook.I basically wrote this:

""Look michelle,I really like you as a freind and in another life maybe we could be more but I think you have a thing with men were you use them.You cant be happy with one man to fullfill all your needs you need men like me and bill (bill is a 72 year old version of me that she knows,a ""sugar daddy who gets no sugar"",and someone she calls for help when her life is in crisis and talks mad shit about when she dont need him)
 for emotional and financila support and then fuck just any old body.Where are these men that come from all over to fuck you when you need a ride to the store,or to work,or to the doctor,or to help you move?Why are they so eager to come running when youre horny but they ghost out when youre in a bad way?""

She wrote back with a few more choice words,admitted to having men issues,but told me not to worry and that Id never have to help her ever again.


Fast forward to early june this year.

I was up at my dads house cleaning some shit up in the garage and saw her mothers bible ,the one she told me to hang onto and read when I was going thru my rough patch (im not a religious person but i humored her and appreciated the thought)on the desk.I got to thinking about her again,and thought i should look her up.I got out to the car and went to leave and had a new text message..

from michelle...

""hey man whats up!long time no see!i miss your face!""

I went back to the garage and got the bible.

two days later she texted me again,and we talked a while,then she mentioned she wanted to smoke some weed,so invited her over.

She came over,we hugged,played catch up over a couple blunts,and she proceeded to tell me whats been happening with her.She told me all about going skydiving,and taking up with this awesome guy named jeff,and how she really really liked jeff,and he is the one that took her skydiving,andhow great and lifechanging it is,and they were staying at this skydiving ""farm"" somewhere in GA with a bunch of cool hippy skydivers.

Till one day jeff went to work,and michelle,just being michelle,decided she would spend the day hanging out being one of the boys.Well,some one decided a few beers would be a good idea,and michelle,being typical michelle,decided she could just have ""one beer""...

michelle never has""just one beer"" and then thats the end of it.Michelle has to have one,then another,then another,then some liquor,then some coke,then let your imagination run wild as to the shenanigans she gets herself into when she decides to have ""one beer""..

needless to say,32 year old michelle got really drunk and fucked (while ragging) a 17 year old virgin who works as a parachute packer on the farm,while her elite skydiving boyfriend was at work making a living.the whole farm found out about it including jeff,and it turned into a big scene,then she missed work,called while drunk and lied about her car being fucked up to cover,then showed up three hours into her shift still hammered,in HER CAR,the one she forgot she told her boss was fucked up,and lost her job.
so lets recap.shes lost her boyfriend,place to stay,whole social circle of friends,and bad ass job,all over ""just one beer"".

so she bailed back home and shacked back up with bill.

now shes also telling me about two other ""boy toys"" shes met at this farm,who are madly in love with her and want her to come stay with them,but ones in jacksonville and ones in mobile,and she""doesnt know what to do with them just yet""...and im also hearing how bill has let his house get foreclosed on,and moved into a small camper on a plot of land out int he woods in the middle of nowhere by a creek,with no running water,and that she'd been sleeping at his camper for a week in a small recliner,showering outdoors with a solar shower,I.E roughing it,from a ladies perspective.

so here i sit,about 6 hours after she got to my house,and listening to all this,and realizing how late its getting,im starting to realize,she has no intentions of leaving tonight.the gears in my head are turning,so i figure,what the hell,its been three years since i myself have been laid,she is apparently throwing the pussy around these days,so i asked her did she want to spend the night ..

she practically said yes before i even asked..


so i get her some boxers and a t shirt to sleep in,and we get ready for bed.

i ask her if we can make out for a little bit,and she said ok..

i start getting all worked up,but i can tell she just isnt feeling it,but i thought maybe she'd take one for the team,and once i went down on her she wouldn't care anymore,as ive turned many a ""no's"" into ""FUCK YEAHS"" just by giving some head,as Ive been told im quite skilled...

she stopped me dead in my tracks at her belly button and said ""nope""

i was like""aww wat the hell why not'

""cause man""..

and i said ""cause man?thats the best excuse you can give""..

she laid there in silence..

i asked her ""am i really that repulsive?"" 

to which she replied ""no,its just...""

i just rolled over and said ""today i learned a 17 year old virgin has more game than me""...

she moaned and said ""ohhh fuck you man its not even about that"" 

""what is it then? do you know me too much?am i too familiar?if i was some schmuck you just met  at the bus stop would you fuck me?""

I said I was going no matter what. He pretended to call his mom back to tell her he wasn't going anymore. Then I asked to look through his phone.

We started jumping to crazy conclusions that he was shooting up at someone's house or got too high and crashed his car. Finally at around 12:30 he texted me saying he was fine and had been back at our apartment most of the night, drinking by himself. He said he lied to get out of the house because he wanted to go to his friend Marc's house to hang out and that he did wind up going there but only for a little while. I came back to our apartment and there was an empty six pack in front of him so he was telling the truth about drinking at home, at least. He apologized to me for his behavior and explained himself to his mother, who then told me she thought maybe her son deserves more, as if I'm ruining his life. We're grown adults. This child was planned. And he already has a 3-year-old. He said he didn't act out because he's overwhelmed by us having a baby, but because i expect him to spend time with his family and focus more on his obligations than on simply going to work, returning home, and expecting me to do it all on my own while he borrows my car every day. He's been apologizing all night but his promises that he's going to improve seem so empty to me. I have no idea how I can get him to actually act on his promises.

I continued to apologize over and over again, asserting that I didn't mean to make anyone angry, while also speaking through sobs.

Everybody was super friendly, and I was getting to know everyone. There was this one guy named Alex that worked there who was really funny. Nice guy, always laughing, and an upbeat and generally fun person to be around. He was an Asian man with a half-red mohawk; whenever he would win a game my friends and I would chant ""Rufio! Rufio!""

Last Friday when I played with him, he opened up to me, seemingly randomly, telling me about how bummed he was about some things; money, his family, etc. He asked me what to do about his problems, and I, being completely oblivious as to how deeply he felt about these things, argued that he was making too big a deal over things, and that how his family was treating him shouldn't be as important as it was to him. 

He got really cold all of a sudden, and got mad at me about how important family was, and how I wasn't taking him seriously; how *nobody* took him seriously. I backed off and played with some other people for a while. I wanted to apologize, but he left before I could. 

This Saturday, there was an anime convention at my University, and the store he worked at would be bringing tons of Magic cards, and it would generally be a good time. I walked in, seeing almost all the employees, and I was waiting for Alex to get there so I could apologize to how I made him feel. I asked the owner of the store where he was, and she quietly told me that he committed suicide. I was absolutely floored, and I can't help but feel that I pushed him over the edge, because as far as I know I was one of the last people he talked to.

This is the first time someone I know died. I've been fortunate in that respect. But I think the first person I know that has died has died in part because of my not listening to his cries for help.

My son loves music, he's good at music, he taught himself to read sheet music, play the guitar and the harmonica and is about to embark on learning the euphonium.

I have work at eight in the morning at a job where I'm central command of at least seven other people, but I could not give less of a fuck. I'm sitting here rocking back and forth wishing I had the little guy back in my arms...

I guess some backstory is in order.

My apartment was robbed back in December one week before Christmas. They stole nearly every technology item I had. My 360. Gone. My laptop. Gone. My high quality studio headphones that I use to write music with. Gone. I took all of that in stride, however, as I had the money saved up for a newer laptop and all my things were backed up remotely on a secure sever (thank god for dropbox), but when I looked on my bed...

Wolfie was gone... he was nowhere to be seen... The bastards took him...

It was... ok initially. I had other stuffed animals I could hold and cuddle with, so I figured I'd just get over the loss of him and move on. But, as I sit here typing this... Goddamnit, I miss him so much. He was my little buddy for a lot of my late highschool and early college years that helped me get through rough nights of studying and heartsickness.

Wolfie was a relatively rare plush only made for a brief time in the 1980s. He was made as a promotional plush for the Big Bad Wolf rollercoaster for Busch Gardens. I stumbled upon him at a yard sale one day, not knowing where exactly he came from. I kept him in my closet for a while, but as I became more interested in werewolf folklore, I got more attached to him. He was one of those plushes that was both adorable and ferocious to hold.

[This is the only picture I have of him right now.](http://i.imgur.com/njjVS.jpg) He was sitting on top of my ""finals load"" for the season (my massive pile of caffeine and various candies that I used to fuel my late night study sessions at the end of my Bachelors).

I've tried to find a replacement for him, but all options seem to be well out of my price range and extremely hard to find. [This is the only one I can find right now, but it's listed at well over $200](http://www.ebay.com/itm/Vtg-Big-Bad-Wolf-Busch-Gardens-Karol-Plush-Toy-RARE-Shirt-Stuffed-Amusement-Park-/310421464386)

I guess I just don't know how to handle this. I thought I was getting better, yet these feelings of longing and missing the little guy just kind of hit me out of left field tonight. Maybe it's not the fact that he's gone, but the fact that I was violated and he was stripped away from me.

I also play the piano for 11 years, baritone saxophone for 5 years and the flute for 7. When I was younger, my parents would go to extreme measures like “No playing with friends,” or “you don’t get_____ if you don’t get an A.” They do not allow a girlfriend, television, video games, and computer (unless for studying, which I should be doing right now). Though I'm on summer break I am signed up for several gifted and talented classes and science, spelling, and engineering competitions along with marching band and cross country. I am also fluent in spanish, which took many hours a day. I also practice the piano for 2-3 hours a day and am caled the same names if I mess up. As you may guess, I never rest. I can't remember the last time I had more than 4 and a half hours of sleep, which is very unhealthy. This has happened my whole life. I respect my parents very much, but am just tierd.

I'm desperately trying to fix myself, and my life. I don't know if I'm strong enough to get through this. I really don't.

I had my son when I was 15, therefore becoming a problem to everyone around me. I'm not an idiot, I'm not selfish, I'm actually trying incredibly hard to be a good parent, and an encouraging and nurturing Mom. I try and do these things, and then feel horrible guilt every time I hear the complaints about how teen parents are basically ""robbing"" infertile couples from having a happy family. Like I alone have committed the most selfish deed by trying to raise my biological child when I should have selflessly put him up for adoption so he could have a ""real family"".

That wasn't what I even intended to write about, I'm just having a really bad day.

I'm Bi Polar too, Type 2. So with me, you'll find lots of depression and only short periods of hypomania... So to say, most of the time I'm sad, and sometimes I'm crazy.
And I'm managing it, somewhat well. My outside world is well organized and managed, for the most part, it's just what's inside that's killing me. 

I graduated school and got accepted into College, I'm an involved parent and take parenting courses and ask for help whenever I feel stuck. I have lots of hobbies and passions, I have a caring boyfriend who supports me, and the most incredible kid who is the single most important thing in my life. 

Yet inside, I feel so sad and broken and alone, and I feel like I can't tell anyone. I feel like by now, as I just turned 20 in January, I shouldn't feel the same sad way I did through my childhood.

But in all honesty, if you looked at my journals then and now, there wouldn't be very much of a difference. I still get to points in my life where I don't know how to react emotionally and can only cope by cutting myself. Considering it used to be a daily thing, and is now only about once every five months, I'd say it's a huge improvement. But it's still there, that feeling. And when I do combat the urge, and just deal with it on my own, the shitty feelings I would have let out by cutting remain inside, festering and turning into yet another internal scar.

The worst thing right now, is my Mom. I don't want to play victim and say she's the reason for all this, but she's definitely the reason for a whole fucking lot of it.
As a little kid she completely destroyed my self worth. She made it clear that I was of little worth to her, and that my existence was the result of a failed marriage to my Father whom she hates. I'm just another by product of something she despises. 

She's BiPolar Type 1. That's the one where you're always depressed, but you get crazy and stay that way too.

When I had my son, she decided to switch her focus to him.. Maybe because I wasn't worth fighting for anymore.. Or whatever.

She fucks up, all the time. I've just told her to go away from now, leave us alone. But she doesn't listen well, which is why she showed up on Christmas day at my Grandma's and attacked me while I was trying to get my boy in the car.

Filing restraining orders on your Mom is a lot more fun than you'd expect. Except not really, and instead it's painful and even though you're in the right, you still feel like there's a huge neon sign hanging above your head screaming ""TRAITOR"".

If you actually read this much, thanks a lot. I didn't realize how long I had gone on for.
I was suppoused to meet with my psychiatrist today, but I don't feel comfortable enough to explain myself. I've been seeing her for months and she doesn't have a clue how I actually feel.

Instead, my therapy today will consist of taking my son to the library, getting new books, and then picking up some valentine's cards and decorating for his preschool friends. I may not be working through my problems right now, but I will be happy. On days like this, being happy is the main objective.

Again, if you have read this, I'm really grateful for your consideration. I feel like everything is in place in my life, everything is working fine and coming together, but I'm trapped behind the good old fucking brick wall of depression.

I feel alienated and ostracized from the world around me, and I am fearful and judgmental of those around me. 

I feel like every ""thing"" is fine, and working well. Yes, all the ""things"" are ok.

But I'm not. I'm still me, at 11 years old, suicidal and self harming. Drowning beneath my feelings of worthlessness and fear. Confusion and distress. To scared to speak out and to angry at myself for being proved unlovable by my Mom.

Secretly, under all my hard work and happiness, I still truly feel...

I deserve all the bad things that happen to me, because I am truly a bad person.

....And I don't want to feel that way. And I don't know what I can do to feel better....

I noticed at parties, people rarely talk to me, and if anything its just to be polite and introduce themselves. For example, I quite often find myself in a group and I'll be drinking by myself while everyone else is having a laugh. It almost gets to the point I have to whip out my mobile to look busy because otherwise I'd be sitting there doing absolutely nothing.

I've also noticed that my number of friends are dwindling. While my group of ""bros"" are finding relationships, they're changing and I'm finding less of an ability to connect with them. It's not that im immature, anything but, but I always get the perception that they now look down on me because they're established while I'm still single (and have been for over 6 years - im 26 atm).

I'm going to start working on my diet and throw out all my clothes because they're so fugly. From my previous jobs, the girls I've known have said I look much better wearing colourful clothing (and atm all I have is depressing black and dark blues). I moved away from coloured clothing (like vibrant tees) because it makes me look more fat.

Looks aside, I really wish I could ""clean"" myself up, get rid of whatever negative energy I have and wish I could just be desired by people in general. For once in my life I wish someone, preferably a female, would actually want to hang out with me, call me, text me.. something.

Its pretty hard being totally undesired, knowing once I had a female in my life that totally wanted to be with me - even in that mildly overweight state back then.

1322850882.0,24,self.MMFB,mxsbx,Don't want to go back to doing sex work ,29,5,35,http://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/mxsbx/dont_want_to_go_back_to_doing_sex_work/,"Hi reddit.

So here's the deal (using my throwaway account).  I got an MBA this past spring.  Thought I would be totally employable, but I'm not.  I have gotten a fair amount of interviews (2 this past week) for admin positions and other things that I am overqualified for, but no jobs.  I have a part-time thing but it's commission and not paying enough.  Yesterday, when rent was due, I had a total of about $75 to my name (my rent is over $600).  

My friends all say how awesome and employable I am, they've helped me re-vamp my resume and cover letters, and I am a really hard worker - overachiever, actually.  Went on foodstamps already (thank FSM I can actually buy food now), and I am at the end of my rope.  I can't go on government assistance (welfare) because I pay too much in rent but it would cost me too much to move.  My family has no money (I'm the only one in my fam to even get a college degree, much less a masters) and I've no rich friends to ask to borrow from.  Plus, later this month I will have over $120K in student debt coming due from undergrad and grad (even though I worked all through school, MBAs are one of the priciest degrees to get).

A bunch of stuff happened (financial crises: car accident, death in the family etc) about a year ago that led me to doing sex work to get by.  Massage+ (or executive massage, if you will).  It wasn't as bad as one might think.  No oral/vaginal, just hand jobs.  Gave a really nice massage in the session before the happy ending since that is my trade (I'm a certified massage therapist).  No one at school and most of my friends would never have guessed, and truly I judged it harshly before I had to resort to it.  As they say, walk a mile in someone's shoes.  Anyway.  I had a couple of experiences with douchebag guys that just made me feel DONE.  And I promised myself that if I ever felt that way I would honor it and not go against it - I have worked too hard on my emotional and mental health to sacrifice it (abusive background, insane family, typical survivor, but I have worked really really hard to be a mostly functional human).

I have a couple of money-making things in the works but can't sell much more off to make money.  I even thought of selling my nearly worthless car and my purebred dog or my computer, but the reality is, I need these things - computer and car for work and dog for sanity.  I can't turn to doing private client massage because I can't carry my table right now (back still injured) and I would have to drum up clients in an already massage therapist-saturated area to work at a rented space.  Plus, I have been doing it for over 10 years but have less than the minimum hours needed to work at most spas where I wouldn't have to carry my table.  I even went off the antidepressants that I had been on for several years because I just can't afford them.  Luckily, I am not suicidal but it's been an added hardship.

I *really* don't want to go back to doing sex work.  Going against that feeling of being ""done"" would make me feel like a whore, which I never felt when I was in that line of work since I honored how I felt and had really good boundaries around it.  

I just don't know what to do.  Please tell me it will be ok.  I know there are lots of people in my situation (and worse, like in Sudan and Ethiopia) and so I try to content myself with that but goddamn it's hard.  I had the first panic attack I'd had in years yesterday and I am still recovering and can't even focus on applying for work when I am in such a state.

**TL;DR I have an MBA and I'm on foodstamps and might have to go back to doing sex work to make money for rent**

I’m 25, and I’m the (entirely) single mom of a gorgeous, quirky 6 year old boy with autism. He is considered severely autistic right now because his communication is severely limited (although beginning to progress, which is amazing!), he isn’t potty trained (despite my best efforts), refuses to engage socially or make eye-contact, and has many obsessive rituals and routines that he is strongly attached to. I love him so much, but I’d be lying if I said it was easy to be his mom, especially since his dad is completely out of the picture so I am raising him alone. However, I refuse to put a ceiling on his potential and hope that with a lot of diligent work on my part and cooperation with his many therapists that someday he will be a fully functional and happy adult. :) 

Despite the whiny tone of this post, I realize that I’m actually very lucky. I am fortunate enough to work full time at a company that seems interested in helping me build a career with them; they give me very positive evaluations and I have been able to promote.  I also am attending college full time where I work extremely hard to maintain (thus far, at least) a 4.0 gpa. I attempt to exercise (at home) at least 3 or 4 times a week and work very hard at keeping up with all the chores and housework at home. But between all of this, I am extremely exhausted and increasingly lonely. 

Dating is an impossibility because between work and school, I feel like I barely get any time with my son as it is. On nights I don’t have school, I get to see him maybe 4 hours, and then nights I do have class, I don’t get to see him more than 30 minutes. Weekends I reserve to spend time with him, which leaves no time for dating, or any other social activity for that matter. His autism restricts the activities we can do and the places we can go, and those limitations make it difficult to downright unenjoyable to try and plan social activities with him involved. I am also well aware of the fact that the selection of guys who will date a single mom with an autistic son is a very slim pool. 

I am just feeling so depressed and lonely. I know eventually I will be out of school and making more money (hopefully!) which will free up some time and hopefully eliminate the paycheck-to-paycheck struggle we currently deal with. After I put my son to bed tonight and made sure all the rooms in the house were clean, I just felt so depressed. What does it really matter if our house is clean? No one but him and I see it anyway. Some weekends the only people I talk to are my son (who doesn’t really talk back) and my dog (who doesn’t talk back either ;) ). I work so damn hard every single day, and yet there is no one to tell me that they’re proud of me. I imagine what it would be like to be enveloped into a warm, comforting hug and want to cry. I would love to go one day without changing a pull-up, for pete’s sake; I’ve been doing that for 6 years! And I wish my little boy could tell me how he was feeling, even just once, without having to resort to frustrated screaming. : ( 

Thank you for indulging me in this super long, whiny vent. I have no one I can really whine to about this in real life, so it feels good to get it out there somewhere. : )

Yeeahh no.

I got the last rejection letter in the mail yesterday. Roughly three months ago, I went in for an interview at the school expecting the worse. The admissions counselor highly favored me, told me that I still have a chance from a holistic perspective, and dismissed me with a huge smile on her face, giving me her warmest regards.

Yet, second by second, I feel more and more ice chill up my spine and through my veins. Bitter cold.

High school was disastrous for me. I was morbidly depressed and had no control over myself/no concentration, especially since I was struggling with Bulimia, which took in the world around me for as much food it took out. I also never developed any discipline relevant to a school environment until I needed it, and even so, it’s still a habit that’s not fully developed.

My grades were awful. At my lowest I didn’t do much besides hope to die every day, and I couldn’t do much besides that because poor nutrition and anxiety drained me of any energy at all. It seems like now my past wishes are finally coming true because my options towards the future are slowly restricting themselves to almost none.

I mean, I expected this with with my terrible grades and lack of anything spectacular to offer to the school i.e. extra curriculars, but progressively, with my consistent failures, I feel like I have nothing to look forward to, I feel deserving of nothing, and I feel like one of the least desirable people in our society. Not only from being rejected the opportunity to pursue a higher education, the only thing I’ve been looking for ward to since the day I stepped into my high school, but because I feel as though I’ve always been rejected by almost everyone else in my everyday life too. With all the socialization involved with being a senior, this only gets worse.

Today my best friend was offered full financial aid and acceptance to her dream school, which is ranked within the top 10 colleges in the country. She found out after we visited it today together. As happy as I am for her, I can’t help but to feel equivalent to a piece of chewed gum stuck under a city park bench.

One last poem for my poetry buddy


Ever since I realized that I liked men, I still have wanted it all. I wanted a tender relationship where I found someone who was perfect for me, and I for him. As our love grew, we would want for nothing else and be happy in that fact, together. Maybe we will adopt. Maybe we'll move to the city. Maybe we'll fuck life in the norm and join a traveling gypsy band. 
Whatever we did, we would decide together. We would learn together. And grow together. Just the two of us. 

I was so very wrong to say that I never felt that there was an us, poetry buddy. I felt an us so incredibly strong that I couldn't hide myself and you. But how can I feel and trust that ""us"" when you think it's perfectly okay to share what is so very special to me with others, under the name of expression? You say you are a butterfly. But when we kiss it is so special to me. So perfect. When I am told that you go and kiss other men, it tells me that it is not special. It hurts me, because it makes me feel like I won't ever truly make you happy, and I fear you'll always need more. If this is truly what you want, for what reason did you text me last night and say ""fuck other men. you are all i need."" That is all I wanted to hear. I let my guard down and was ready to move forward and trust you and trust us. 
Today you told me that the very night you sent that text, last night, you made out with another man.
 If it means nothing to kiss other men, then why is it so necessary to who you are, that you can't stop, not even for me?

*Live in dads old house that he doesn't use
*Dad get's gf, she hates us, now we are getting kicked out
*In college, trying really hard to get a job anywhere but no luck
*Just can't do it anymore

My day has been terrible. Went to go look at an apartment for me and my mom and it will costs too much. No matter what I do, no matter how I budget I have to put money on a credit card every month, It's a never ending cycle.


I hate my dad. He doesn't care about me. He is apparently getting married now and he didn't even tell me. He even planned a vacation for him, his fiancee and her kids but I can't go. I asked very politely if he could give us some money to help out. His response was ""Uhhh...ummm.........try getting a job."" I have tried getting a job you scum, I didn't have the world handed to me on a fucking plate. 

Every time I try to get a job anywhere it's always been the same, I didn't have the qualifications, I don't have enough experience, or they hire someone older than me.

I just don't know what to do anymore. I've sold almost all my stuff so that we can pay off all the bills and have gas in the car. I just don't know what to do. A few people have messaged me telling me to go check out r/assistance and other stuff but I am sick of borrowing money. I hate asking for money. I'm tired of owing other people money. I hate being at the bottom of the damn chain begging others for money. I'm 18! I take care of my mom and I get no help from anyone. Nobody cares.

I even hate helping other people. I know it sounds bad but it's true. I am online at times and I look around reddit to offer any advice I have or try to cheer people up because I can. But I hate it. I'm not happy. I want to smile, I want a friend, I want someone to hold again. I hope my ex stays alone forever. Why should she get to be happy? She left me to be with someone else because she basically didn't love me anymore. Now I'm alone, crying every night, I have nobody to talk too. I can't make friends, I try but I just can't do it.

I just can't do this anymore. It's too much to handle. I want to be held and told it'll be okay, or go too sleep and never wake up. Either one would be great. I don't want to be awake in this world anymore.

And then I skipped town, left the country to go to graduate school. Don't get me wrong, it was amazing, and well worth it.  But I come back having quit my jobs and no place to live and positively no savings.  I couldn't legally have a job over where I was for visa purposes, and even if I could, grad school was a bitch, I certainly didn't have the time.

I am a film and video major at Columbia College Chicago and I have an ultimate dream of making a blockbuster film based on the Warhammer 40k Dawn of War Campaign centered around Force Commander Gabriel Angelos. 

Some days I feel like everything I am doing in film school is for nothing and that anything I think of that is remotely interesting to me can't be done because of XYZ reasons. I recently found an idea to make a film for a competition called Firefox flicks and wanted to get a crew together. When I sent a bunch of people who I admire working with a message over Facebook I didn't get a single response. 

Because of this and other small various related incidents I feel like I have no direction in my life and there is no way for me to switch my majors due to how much money I'll owe the government when I get out of here and how far along I am with Film program.

On top of that I feel like I somehow blacklisted my name on reddit because everything I ever post gets downvoted and  I know that isn't a huge deal but it is demoralizing. I suffer from obesity and I try to lose the weight but fail every time I do.

I've gone through life being a fairly introverted person and the fact that a girl that I was definetly attracted to was making the effort to get my number kind of blew my mind. We talked and hung out a few times and I decided to ask her out. This whole time she seriously thinks i'm the greatest guy ever and she really seems to be crazy for me (which is weird for me). This girl would do anything for me.

 Months pass and she tells me she had been raped prior to meeting me (i'm thinking it happened 4ish months before we met). She was 15 at the time and the guy that raped her was in his early 20's, it's really fucked up. It was her brothers friend and she never explicitly said so but i'm fairly confident she was drunk/stoned when it happened. 

She said she was literally carried off by this guy kicking and screaming and thrown in a room as the guy proceeded to rape her. No idea to what extent, im afraid to ask. The dude leaves the party and says to her brother ""dude i just fucked your sister."" 

This is all she told me about the incident itself but i was absolutly devestated. I almost broke up with her out of disgust and sadness that this sweet girl had gone through that but I just couldn't justify doing that to this girl that I care about.

I'm begging you to give me some advice. I've continued to date her and we have regular sex and we're both clean. She's 17 now and im 19 but it literally is constantly looming overhead. The fucker that did it was caught and paid something like 200,000 in bail and is now back out on the streets. i've never met him.

I'm seriously asking for help here. I feel like it is a huge setback and I find myself laying in bed at night with this feeling of absolute repulsion and anger about it. Theres nothing I could do to stop it I didnt even know her then but it just for some reason will not go away. It kills me. I try to be supportive and she doesn't seem to think about it much. But I know I do. almost daily. 

TL;DR girlfriend was raped before I met her and the anger is constantly looming over my mind

1331853812.0,21,self.MMFB,qyjhq,"Got myself in a horrible situation. Fell in love with a girl with too much baggage. She left. Super depressed, NEED HELP!",23,2,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/qyjhq/got_myself_in_a_horrible_situation_fell_in_love/,"I've gotten myself into a pretty fucked up situation here and need some serious help. I worked as a delivery man at this pizza place close to my house. I started working there last summer. I started to like the girl who worked the register. She was really pretty, I'm talking a solid 9.5/10. Around September before college started again I came to find out she is dating my boss. She's 18, he's 28. I decided I don't really need to work during college. My boss was pretty lenient and told me I can come back and work there during winter break. Now I should mention I've had emotional problems ever since highschool and had been seeing a therapist for about a year. When I started college I was feeling good and decided I don't need therapy anymore and stopped cold turkey. Now for about the first month I was good. But I started fucking up. Basically I ended up dropping every class except one and ended up passing with a C. I was feeling like a fucking failure. 

Ok so winter break starts and I go on a drug binge for a week. I start work afterwards. Now a week in I realize the girl and the boss's relationship is getting kind of rocky and she has started to talk to me about it. Basically we talk when he's not around and I give her advice and shit like that. Now one night when we're talking I notice she has scars on her wrist, I don't say anything though. That same night I'm awakened by a text. It was her and she wanted to talk about her relationship and all that shit. Now at this point since I've stopped therapy I'm feeling pretty depressed. After she's done telling me about her bf she asks me if there's anything bothering me...and well I spill every god damn thing. This sparks something between us. We texted all night pretty much talking about our problems. I asked her about the scars and she tells me she had been cutting since 10th grade, and that she had tried to kill herself before by taking pills. She also told me about a few times where she was almost raped. And I told her my thoughts of suicide in the past and the fucked up shit in my childhood. We made a bit of a connection that night (through our problems). I was intrigued by her...everything she told me interested me.

Now fast forward a few days. It's New Years I'm at a party, she's at home and I get drunk and tell her I liked her. Now after I told her this our conversations go into the next level, we start flirting at work and pretty much text eachother all day long. She opens up to me fully and I do the same. I come to realize her parents are super religious and her home is basically a prison, her father is insanely controlling and abusive and forces her to pay bills. Alright so the closer we get, I start to notice she's really depressed, she keeps telling me to leave her and that she's bad for me and that I deserve better and she will end up hurting me. She always talks about wanting to disappear or just leave this country, basically she talks a lot about isolating herself. But the attachment I felt to her was too strong and I couldn't walk away. I started to fall in love with her and she told me she was falling in love with me. Well she ends up having a lot of fights with her bf at this point and we just keep getting closer. We've hung out a few times, I taught her how to drive blablabla. So one night she calls me crying, saying her bf choked her and pushed her around and bruised up her arms. Now at this point the most we've done is hug, I can say that I still had some respect for her bf and didn't go any further than that, but after she told me this all bets were off. I take her to a park that night to calm her down, and we held hands...she cried a bit and I held her and kissed her (on the cheek), I asked her if she wants to stay with him and she told me no. So after this we start to really miss each other when we weren't together. We're literally texting from the time we wake up to when we go to sleep. And one night she decides to sneak out of her house and we end up making out and touching and all that stuff in my car. So, yeah she cheated on him...Alright so we do this a few more times and I decide I want to take all my classes with her when college starts up again. Idk but I think I got a case of White Knight Syndrome and really wanted to save this girl from her life. 

Now take into consideration that all this is happening while I'm still working there.  So I start getting jealous and angry when she talks to him and hugs him and laughs with him, shit like that...So we get into an argument one night about why she won't leave him. She tells me she's afraid of change and that she loves him. But I still can not leave her. The thought of losing her scared the fuck out of me. So she's basically depressed every day now, and I'm spending most of my time trying to make her feel better and it also starts to affect me in a negative way, (lose my appetite, have obsessive thoughts, fear of losing her). A week before college I decide to quit my job. Ok so college starts and we take our first class. The night before we had a pretty weird conversation. She had started to feel guilty about cheating on him and kept saying she really loves him. She tells me I should leave her because I deserve better. She says she feels like the only reason I fell in love with her was because I opened up to her and that it would have been the same with any other girl. So now my anxiety is pretty bad and the feeling of losing her is eating away at me. I tell her not to leave me and she said she won't. Okay so next day I take her out to this viewpoint I know and she was acting really weird and wouldn't kiss me. That really fucked with me, but she ended up kissing me a bit later. 




THIS IS WHERE SHIT STARTS GOING DOWNHILL




Now I drop her off and she goes to work. She sends me a text saying ""omg don't text me until I text you"", now this usually meant that her bf was suspicious (not the first time). So about an hour later she calls me and tells me to come pick her up, she didn't say what happened. I go get her and she tells me that he broke up with her because she sent him a text she was supposed to send me. I take her somewhere and we just sit in the car, she cries, she calls her friend. Well he ends up calling her and telling her to go back to work. Okay so she texts me later that night and she's super depressed about the whole thing and feels very guilty. She tells me that he won't let her touch him or talk to him. Now the next day I take her out again and we're just in the car. I notice she's acting weird and she tells me ""I did something..."" but she wouldn't tell me what. So I push and push until she shows me her wrist and she had cut herself. Now that fucked with me a lot. She was obviously hurting really bad but I thought she was just going through a phase. Now I take her back to work that night and she texts a few hours later telling me she left work because she couldn't take it anymore. She told me that she had told the guy the text was for me, but she had made up a story about how I had told her I liked her and that was the only reason she was texting me. She wouldn't tell me where she is. She tells me she's taken 12 advils...now I start to freak out and don't know what to do, she kept telling me she's fine and that 12 advils won't kill her. She wouldn't tell me where she is. So she goes home and I feel better and I just fall asleep cus at this point I'm mentally exhausted. 

So next day around mid afternoon she calls me and says she left the store again. She comes to my house and she just cries and cries and cries. He calls her up and tells her to come back to work so I take her back. Now it's Tuesday (Valentines Day) and I have a breakdown. I'm absolutely scared that she's going to fucking kill herself and I can't call her or text her because she's at work. I end up calling my therapist and setting up an appointment. Now around 4pm she calls me and tells me the guy is freaking out about the text and has lost his shit. I tell her to just get the fuck out of there but she won't listen. About 5 hours later she texts me saying she told him everything about what we did. And I'm thinking okay so it's over. Nope...She breaks down, FULLY BREAKS DOWN, and tells me he didn't even get angry that he cried and blamed himself. She tells me she made a mistake that he was the love of her life that he was her world and that she broke him. She got super suicidal, really dark shit. So now I'm freaking the fuck out and I try to calm her down telling her he wasn't good for her, but nothing is fucking working. So I tell her I'll fix this and I'll get them back together. I start texting him literally begging him to take her back so she doesn't fucking kill herself. He's drunk as fuck and he's telling me that he can't be with her anymore and that I should take care of her from now on. So here I am, in the middle of this shit, a girl I had fallen in love with is trying to kill herself over another guy, and the other guy doesn't want her. So after begging him for about an hour he starts texting her and calms her down.

 Now next day, Wednesday. She goes to work again and it's the same thing, he's crying, won't let her touch him or talk to him. She calls me up tells me to go over there and ""give her soul back"". At this point I am mentally broken. I go over there, none of us talk, I just sit in the kitchen staring at the floor, this last for an hour until suddenly she's crying and screaming at him telling him she's sorry that she fucked up that she loves him. He's telling her he can't be with her anymore that she's like his sister now that he loved her and she was his life. I'm still sitting there and can't say anything. Just had the most empty feeling. And out of nowhere he grabs her and tells me to check her bag for pills. I wasn't sure wtf happened but I check her bag and tell him there's nothing there. Then she distracts us and downs a bottle of pain meds. The guy grabs her by the throat and throws her on the floor and sticks his fingers in her mouth to get her to throw up, this lasts for an hour. So now she's telling him she'll kill herself if he doesn't take her back. So we spend the rest of the night calming her down, and he tells her they'll work things out.

 Now when she's not paying attention he takes me to a corner and we have a talk. He tells me he doesn't want to be with her anymore and that he needs my help to leave her. He tells me he'll let me have her and that he'll just sell the shop and move away. At this point I'm pretty desperate, not really to keep her but to make sure she doesn't kill herself. So I agree. Later that night when I'm home she's texting me, basically the same depressive things. She ends up falling asleep but I didn't know...so I start freaking out and so does the other guy. We're basically losing our shit, he tells me to copy paste whatever texts she sent me that night, and he tells me that from this day on I need to send him her texts. Okay so next day she calls me in the morning before work, we talk a little and she tells me she'll call me when she gets home. Alright so fast forward, she texts me, again talking about the same depressive shit. I show the guy those texts. But then she says what I had been dreading ""We need to stop talking"", so she calls me, we have this whole crying session, her telling me how amazing I was to her and that she'll never forget me and that I deserve better and that she'd still like to keep in contact through e-mail. Now I didn't tell the guy anything about the conversation we had that night. I just told him she called and said she doesn't want to talk anymore. Ok so that's that. 

Now next day (Friday) around 2:00 PM or so the guy calls me and tells me he wants me to send her a text. I tell him she doesn't want to talk anymore so what's the point? He tells me it's ok, he wants to help me get her back and that he wants her to ""lie"" to him, so he has a reason to leave her. He told me she went to pick up her brother from school and that I should hurry up and send it before she gets back to the store. So I sent her a text saying ""I don't mean to bother you but I just wanted to know how you're doing"". She doesn't text back. So later that night I decide to go out with a couple of my buddies and smoke some weed because I'm feeling like shit. So around 11 pm he calls me again. He tells me that he saw the text I sent her because she came into the store 2 mins after I sent it and he asked to see her phone. He said she told him she didn't see it and he said it was ok. Now he told me to send her another text in 20 min. He says the same thing that he wants her to lie to him. He says he's going to be good to her for a while make her feel better but that he'll do something really bad and make her leave him. I say ok. Now I smoke weed and I start thinking about what's been happening. And something within me wasn't feeling right about doing this to her. The whole texting thing felt really wrong and manipulative. So I end up texting her and spilling the beans. She's pretty pissed, she says I was the only person she trusted and that I fucked that up. But at the same time she's texting him and she tells me ""I still believe him"" but won't tell me what he's saying. Anyway I tell her I'm sorry that I wasn't thinking straight that this whole situation has fucked with my head and I get super depressed. 

So next day she calls me, and I tell her what happened again and she's angry at me blablabla. So she tells me he's calling her and hangs up. She sends me a text saying ""Don't text me, don't call me, nothing. I'll explain later."" So the whole day I'm depressed and just sleep. I expected her to text me when she got home but she didn't, so I text her asking her to tell me what happened. No answer...I get woken up to a text from the guy. He tells me that I fucked up any chance of getting her back by telling her his plan. He tells me to never contact her again and that she's his gf and he's recording all her phone calls and texts. So I'm still thinking she wanted to keep in contact through email...so I email her the next day but I get no response. Now Monday night I send her a message on youtube asking her to talk to me, she responds by saying ""what do you want me to say?"" I'm pretty depressed now and I say some things I shouldn't have said, she tells me she's happy now and that she loves him and that he's her life. She tells me I should have left her like she had told me to do and that a lot of things had changed since Friday. Then she just stops messaging me. This honestly fucked with me really bad. 

I can't believe a girl that I had such deep feelings for is able to so easily delete me from her life. I ended up getting super drunk a week ago driving around and I called her like 6 times leaving voicemail messages. Her bf calls me because I guess she told him I called and I'm crying my eyes out telling him idk wtf I'm doing. He tells me to go see him at the shop and we have a talk. Idk wtf to do anymore, I'm really depressed and I just wish she would keep in contact with me. I'm scared to leave the fucking house because everything reminds me of her. I'm feeling really empty and have thought about killing myself numerous times. Idk why I can't get her out of my head, I want to be friends with her. I feel so fucking weak and vulnerable, I'm trying to man up but nothing seems to be working. I've come to find out she has something called Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD), at least from what I've been reading on the internet.I need all the advice I can get right now because my thoughts have become very negative and it's taking a toll on my life and I'm genuinely scared of the world. I really want to move on from this but I can't fucking get her our of my mind, I think about her all day long and I dream about her every night. I miss her a lot and still want her to be a part of my life, just as friends, but I can see that it won't happen. I really need help here.

I belong to a number of social networking sites, and all of them give me the same idea of the social norms of women. They involves the norms of relationships and perceptions of the opposite sex. In my American society, men and women are supposed to be seen as equals. Apparently this does not apply to relationships. Women want to have the same things as men, but when it comes to relationships, it all comes down to the man. I always see things about how ""the guy is supposed to text the girl first."" Well honestly, if the girl wants to talk, she should just fucking talk to him. Why is it the responsibility of the man? What kind of shit is that? There is also this belief among women that men that they like should like them too. If that male doesn't, he's a bad person for only wanting to be friends, or whatever the case is. Girls also say that ""guys are so mean and shallow."" Apparently that statement doesn't apply to them. Numerous times I have seen guys get embarrassed by a girl, either publicly, or online. It's always a deep, personal attack that leaves the guy scarred. But, if a guy does this, even if it's not as severe, it's seen as horrible. One more thing I would bring up is something that I saw this morning. I was on one of the social networking sites, and a girl posted this. ""Guys see girls as books: if they don't like the cover they don't bother reading what's inside."" Now yes, I understand, some guys do, but girls do it too. But what gets to me, is what she posted 16 minutes later. ""Cute guys should message me."" Now, this is only one example, but it's the most recent of a series of similar experiences that I've seen. Honestly, it's annoying as shit. I'm tired of it always being the males fault. I'm tired of it being one way. ""I'm glad we broke up, I can't believe he was hanging out with that slut."" and then posting ""I can't wait to go out with the guys tonight! It'll be so much fun ;)"" Now I know that there are some girls that don't do this, but I think there are too many brainwashed ""fairy tale ending"" girls out there.

Let me clear this up. I'll try to do this by typing out my train of thought that lead to this somber epiphany. I am very overweight, the victim of child sex abuse, bullying and emotional abuse at home. I don't want to lose weight because i have been heavy all my life and its become part of who I am. I have never had a girl friend or a date or anything really. My life is really just me against the world. So I don't want to lose weight because it has never come from me to want to. I don't want to give into the world. People tell me i should lose weight for my health or to get a girlfriend but I don't care enough about my life to want to be that healthy, and no one who wouldnt love me as I am now is worth the time and effort to lose weight for.
This is where I began to unravel. I noticed that I can't have what I want if I hold the course. I want more than anything to find my one and start a family. Nothing else really means anything hobbies are just leisure to me and a job or even a career are just a means to an end. even my dream job if I could have it is just just a job it wouldn't be fulfilling enough to keep me going. I can't get a woman to love me as I am for some reason I suspect my looks. But I am so unwilling to give into this world that has been so cruel to me that losing weight feel like betrayal. That so much of my life and who I am is built on this me vs the world mentality, that changing would mean shameful soul crushing defeat. If i broke down and lost the weight nothing would change. I would still be angry and bitter and depressed. I would hate the world even more so because i had to change because i wasnt good enough. I realize if I gave in then I wouldn't enjoy the things i want so badly if i did get them. If I lose weight I admit I'm not good enough. If then iI find someone I will never fully love them, I will always resent them because I gave in. Because in my eyes they don't love the real me. I can never escape this pit of anger bitterness and depression. I will always feel this way this is nothing I can do to change this. My weight isnt the problem is the that I am depressed that I am bitter and angry and scarred. And I don't know what will change that, nothing will, I was robbed of my innocence and happiness long ago and I have just been left to grow angrier and more bitter and more depressed and to fill the hole with food. Nothing I can do will change that my dream of having a happy family is impossible. I will never be happy I will never know mutual love. I will be trapped in this hell forever till I can't take anymore.
That when I realized will either I kill myself soon out of loneliness, or i kill myself down the line out of bitterness and resentment. But I won't see old age I wont age and wait grandchildren grow up. All paths lead to my suicide. Sooner or later no matter what I do that's how its going end for me. When this thought first hit me and sunk in I cried, like a baby I just put my head in my hand and cried uncontrollably for an hour. And though my tears I begged for help, and I am still begging for help. I don't want to go out like that.

As the title says, I failed my entrance exams into my Masters degree. I had to do a resit exam this week, and I failed it. I should've studied harder, but I didn't think I'd fail. Hell, everything has always fallen into place for me. So now I'm not allowed entrance into the Masters section of my degree. If I wanted to get back into it, I would have to write the examination committee and ask for a resit (and then it's not even a guarantee I'll get it). The resit would take place in November this year. I'd then have to wait until February next year before I can really continue with my thesis and so on.


I'm at a loss what I should do now. I'm turning 23 soon, and I only have a Bachelors degree (dime a dozen). I have no real 'goal' in life. I always figured that if I had a masters degree, I could get a decent job and then eventually earn a good amount of money. 


But ever since I took that exam this week, and knowing that I won't pass (barring an act of God - 0,00000001%), I've been indifferent towards anything and everything. I just have no real....passion anymore.


I don't know what to do, how to get back on the horse etc again. Time flies, and if I were to continue like this, I'd be 25 before I'd finally get my degree (assuming they'd want to grant me a resit).

So basically someone I know died, she was transgendered, and her family were completely shit to her which led to her eventual suicide.

I'll paste this here

Stuff her family did:
Beatings from her dad and emotional trauma from her mom. She was also raped by her cousins. Her parents were super religious and the radical church they went to was not radical enough for them so left and started preaching to her and her sister in the living room everyday.

It triggered her anorexia at an early age. After she started transitioning and dealing with her anorexia, her parents would comment on how much she was eating and that there was no way people would beleive she was a girl with the ammount of food she was putting down. The huge ammount of food would be two frozen burritos a day.

When she got in the car accident that put her in a coma for two months and resulted in some minor brain trauma, her parents back billed her for all the hospital fees (the $25k that their insurance didnt cover) and never let her forget how they ""chose"" to help her.

Basically on her obituary, and funeral page her family are whitewashing it completely, censoring any attempt to let people know what they did. Any attempt to refer to her as a she and Natalie gets quickly amended to Nathan and he by the family.

http://sheetsandchilds.net/nathan-ronald-castor/

What kind of place can I take this kind of information to, where her family can't touch it. I want people to know what kind of people her family were, on a well known website. Everyone wishes them condolences yet they don't know that the family are the ones who contributed greatly to the pain she suffered in life, and are now dishonoring her and her friends in death by censoring any attempt to let her identity be known.

Through most of high school I was a pretty well-liked guy and had a solid group of 15ish friends I'd spend time with almost every weekend night. I was confident and invested in my friendships and in my hobbies. Sure, I had some bad days, but I spent most of my time very happy.

Then a year and a half ago I moved to college at a state university. And shit, have I been lonely. I have a friend or two I made out of necessity (basically just somebody to live with so I don't get a bad match of a random roommate), but I literally have nobody to spend time with on the weekends. To make things worse, I go to a huge party school in a college town, so I feel like this entire city is having the time of its life and I'm just so entirely lost.

I think I've gotten to the point where I realize just how complete my loneliness is. I was happy here at first. My entire freshman year I studied unbelievably long hours. This was a habit I could not keep up, so this year I started going to parties at my older brother's house just off campus. And that seemed great for a time. But I just show up, get drunk, and leave; I never make friends or even contribute anything to the tight-knit group that always hangs out there.

All in all, I guess I've come to a point where I realize that I never gave a damn about my classes and I never really cared about the people I partied with; I just used intense studying and binge drinking to push my loneliness to the back of my mind (as juxtaposed as those two pursuits may seem).

This loneliness is so complete, and I lack the balls to do anything to deal with it. I've considered drinking alone, trying drugs, offing myself, dropping out of college, moving away for a while ... but I never do any of it. And that's a good thing, I suppose, since all those things in the back of my mind are such desperate measures. But at the same time, the lack of something cathartic like that lends such a constant, consuming edge to being lonely.

I don't know what to do, but I'm sick of my life being how it is. Sorry for such a long post, and I know there's probably thousands more of these out there.

I live in England and i am just starting my own business, i was at the shop putting some shelves up and boxing in the electric meter when a group of lads started banging on my windows and swearing at me i ignored them so they started kicking my door which is glass, i have wioreless shutter controls so i clicked the fob to make shutter go down as i did it a couple of them started to grab the shutter i could hear the motor stressing trying to move. so i stopped the shutter and sent it back up (it had not even made it halfway) i opened the door and told them to ""clear off and let me finish my work."" after i said this one of the lads behind me shouted ""Are you daft"" and punched me in the back of the head, he then punched me in the back of the head and pushed me in the shop.

the next thing i know ive got my back to the counter with 4 guys all punching me so i punched the closest one (about 17yo) ducked down and charged my way out. i ran to the indian takeaway 2 doors down and shouted ""call police.""

the lads then came in the indian and started trying to punch me so one of the indians grabbed me and threw me into the back and blocked the door so they couldnt get in (couragous man) but what happened next amazed me the lads shouted ""bring him out here or we'll smash your windows"" the owner Ali said ""smash them then but you arent having him"" (they didnt smash them though).

the police arrived and took me to my shop the lads had gone when they saw them about 8 cops turned up in total i was of course shaken and examined my shop they had put a hole through my newly built counter and dented my wall which had just been plastered this morning but not to much damage.

as i was talking to the police man he said there isnt much he can do because they have more witnesses (which is absolutely atrocious i think) then my sister arrived and said 3 big guys where looking for me (i was petrifide im 5'8 and way 9 stone) but she said theyd come to help apparently one of the guys had seen what was happening and called his mates they had all raced down in car to come help me the police say the guy commented saying ""the little lad wouldnt have had a chance there was about 30 of them and about 10 went into the shop"".

It's just that my SO doesn't communicate to me at all. He also doesn't do things with me that couples do, like go out together with friends or visit my family. He never does anything for my birthday, or even say 'Happy Birthday' to me. I always feel like I did something wrong, and there probably is something I did wrong in his eyes, that he wants me to feel bad about. I think he's a psychopath. What makes it worse, is that I went to my best friends birthday dinner today, and (got surprised), to meet her (first) new boyfriend for the first time. I am happy for her. She's waited a long time to find someone, and he seems really nice, and someone who will treat her well. It's just that seeing that happy couple just makes me feel even more depressed that my marriage isn't working out. There's no one I want to burden with this stuff IRL when I am upset. I am just writing this out on Reddit to MMFB. I don't expect any advice or replies, but feel free to give them. 

edit: More Info:  
I've heard, communication is the key to a happy marriage, but one of our problems is that there is no communication. So there's bigger issues than having disagreements that need to be dealt with first. I am introverted, so I don't talk much, but he is even more so. His not communicating is an excuse/symptom from having disagreements, but it is also a personality issue with him. He doesn't talk to anyone he's (blood/marriage related) to. He doesn't talk to his parents for no reason I or they can figure out. I asked him before we got married, and he said he didn't have any issues with them.    
  
Nothing is going to be solved without communicating, but I think it's hopeless communicating to someone who doesn't want to listen. Communicating (when you're an introvert) is hard enough as it is.   

2nd edit:  
I went to my parents place, and I didn't mean to tell them about my issues, but it came out, cause they asked. It was like a dam breaking at the worse possible moment. I had no idea it'd affect me so much. I walked off awhile to gather my composure, and my dad came to check on me, but I just didn't want him to see me this way. I know, it's not relevant, but I love my dad very much. The last thing I want him to do is worry about me because it's not good for his health.  They also suggested that I talk to him, and to look at what makes him upset at me, and see what I can do to fix them since I am not fault free. My dad suggested having him see a psychologist, but it's not one of the most do-able solutions.   
  
An online friend who's been through this before, suggested that I separate from him for awhile to shock him into doing something about improving our relationship.

1307389666.0,23,self.MMFB,ht3mn,Social Anxiety problems anyone?,24,1,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/ht3mn/social_anxiety_problems_anyone/,"This is my first reddit post. I've been a long time lurker, but these past few days this has been weighing on me, and I just need to get it out somewhere. Also, as an advanced warning, this is going to be long winded and most likely poorly formatted. I'm mostly spewing things as they come to mind, so try and bear with me. 

I'll start off with some information about myself. I'm 22 years old, still live with my parents, have a part time job as a bank courier, have been in and out of a community college for a few years now. I'm encountering a growing amount of self loathing with each passing year.

I've always been sort of a shy guy. I've only dated two girls to this day, and both of them have made the first move, due to me being anxious and over-analyzing their intentions. I have a few friends, most of which I've known for a long time (I'm terrible at making new friends). My shyness seems to have reached some kind of new level in the past few years when I find myself getting anxious and ignoring calls from friends or family (both of which get frustrated). In the past year or so, I joined an upstart band as the keyboardist, but stopped attending practice after a few months due to the extreme uneasiness I would feel trying to fit in with my band-mates (who were all extremely social people). I liked every one of them; but I couldn't shake this anxiety and was losing sleep dreading practice.

I'm perpetually tired during the day. This, I know, is largely due to the fact that I'm up all night; but I find night to be the only time I can really relax. Nightly walks are one of my favorite activities. I used to play games a lot during the night. I now find myself browsing the internet mindlessly, dreading the morning.

I'm pretty good at acting casual and outgoing when I'm confronted with a necessary social encounter (such as a boss, or a friend of a friend), but it's like a huge weight off my chest when the conversation ends and I can escape to a bathroom or my car. I really feel like I have nothing to talk about with anybody, and tend to get incredibly awkward when a topic is brought up which I have little or no interest in, or knowledge about (politics and sports being the two prime offenders).

I recently joined a gym in an attempt to help quell this anxiety. I'm not overweight in the least, or even out of shape really, but I figure it can't hurt. The last relationship I was in ended over 3 years ago, and I can't help but be scared of being Forever Alone. Then again, it doesn't matter how toned I am if I can't carry on a conversation with girls I'm not extremely familiar with.

One of the most calming things that has happened to me recently was a friend of mine introducing me to one of his friends. She's actually 5 years younger than me, and in high school still. Pedobear jokes aside, we hang out a lot at night (completely innocent in nature, and I have no ulterior motives). We mostly play video games and take walks around town. It feels great because it's so simple. There's nothing complicated about it, and I don't feel like I have to be something that I'm not around her.

I wasn't in school this past semester because I'm not sure whether I passed my classes in the previous semester. Class itself can be a problem for me. I actually enjoy learning, but the environment makes me completely paranoid to the point where I dread going. I miss days here and there when I'm feeling particularly anxious about it and end up falling behind. Halfway through last semester, the school changed around the website and everyone was supposed to receive new login info. I never did, and called the given number twice before I became too nervous that I was doing something wrong and never called back. I couldn't check my grades or assignments from that point on, and to this day have no idea if I passed all of or any of my classes. I also received a notice in the mail the other day saying that I owe ~$2000 to the school which FAFSA apparently didn't take care of. I barely make enough money to cover the gas I use on my job, and can see no way to come up with the money. I want to go back to school this next semester, but I don't know what effect this debt, or my grades will have on my further education. I'm completely terrified of asking for help, to the point where I will literally make myself sick over it.

I mentioned previously that I'm living with my parents still. I've actually had several different friends offer to get an apartment or a house with me (I'm incredibly easy going, and almost impossible to provoke). The band I was in for a few months even offered to let me live with them for free. The idea of having to be around people constantly terrifies me, however, and I always make up an excuse as to why I can't move out at the moment. I also feel like if I move out in the state I'm in now, I'll in a way have sealed my fate and have little chance of finishing up college.

I see nothing good about myself, and no matter how much I try, I can't help but feel anxious about just about everything in my entire life. I have no idea where to even start getting out of this hole which I feel I've dug myself into. Has anyone else gone through a similar experience that would be willing to offer some advice? Thanks a lot if you read all of this. Even if nobody does, it felt good to write it out.

TL;DR: I'm a 22 year old who lives with his parents, has a part time job, isn't in school at the moment, and is terrified of just about everything (including friends at times). I'm in a bit of debt, can't stick with anything, can't ask for help, and the most calming thing in my life is a high school girl that I play video games and take walks with. I have no idea what to do.

Lil Bit was such a good dog. My mother found her in 1998 ish, she was a pregnant stray. My mom loved her so much. One story she used to tell was about her philandering boyfriend. One night after he had been MIA for awhile he came to see my mom. Lil Bit would not allow him on the bed. He said, ""get that dog off the bed!"" She replied, "" Why should I? This dog has been more loyal to me than you, and SHE deserves to be in my bed, not you!""  She even fought off a pit bull that attacked them on a walk, and had Lil Bit in its jaws. She beat it in the head with a 2x4 until it finally let go. Lil Bit carried the scars proudly , four punctures on each side of her chest. 

Years passed and my mom gave Lil Bit to my brother because she moved to California. I was busy raising my family. She really never wanted anything to do with me when she was with my mom, she was a one person dog for sure. Fast forward to 2006 my brother got real sick. We went to see him and discovered his animal hoarding was out of control. Lil Bit had no hair and was fighting to survive among 6 other dogs and who knows how many cats. My mom asked me to take her. 

 She also had another litter of puppies to care for. I took her home with me, a loyal dog like her deserved a better life. She had 3 puppies that I quickly found homes for with friends. Then she was my dog, and we nursed her back to health. Her red hair became long and luxurious and she loved having a spa day and being groomed. We loved her to pieces every single day till the last. When I had my baby in 2009 Lil Bit took over and became her nanny. That same year my mother died so Lil Bit was one of the last remnants of my mothers love. She became a sort of icon. I keep mothers ashes on a little table in my office and Lil Bit always slept under it.

 She was my constant companion, the first living thing I saw in the morning and her big brown eyes were the last I would see before I went to sleep. I work from home, and she would always sit under my desk. ""lets go to work Lil Bit!"" and she knew exactly what that meant. 

 On Monday after her walk she had some sort of seizure. The vet said this could happen, and when it did we should know it was the end. She had severe damage to her lungs because my mom and brother were chain smokers. She would get these coughing fits which would settle down after awhile but this night, she just couldn't catch her breathe.  I held onto her for hours while she laid her head on my chest and stared into my eyes. It was like she was saying, "" Its OK, I'm fine! don't cry"" She was trying to comfort me. 

 My other dog Max knew something was very wrong and I could tell from his behavior this was the end for our Lil Bit. Me and my girls just sat there and cried, holding her, telling her how lovely she was and the best dog ever. We finally went to bed, and the last thing I remember was her coming to my side of the bed and struggling to breathe. I got her on the bed and she curled up next to me. 

 Soon she was very still and I felt her spirit go. This was on Tuesday. We are all still so sad and cant believe shes not here. Even the pee stains on the carpet make me cry, remembering how she would try so hard to hold it when I slept late.  

I feel like she can never be replaced and how cruel it is that all good dogs cant just live forever.  I cant get over this heavy sense of grief. Ive had human friends who passed that I didn't feel this level of grief for. Please help me feel better.

He's from a southeast Asian country. He's an extremely abusive father/husband. In the past, he has physically beaten my mother, my sister, my brother, and I. However, the two main recipients have been my mother and I. I am the oldest of three.

My mother is also abusive. Not to the same degree, but she is. Once when I was in seventh grade, my sister and I were arguing over a small thing. Some random cookie she had stolen from me that I was saving. Or something like that. My mother got so mad, she threw a ceramic plate at us. It missed and hit the floor. One of the chunks of the plate sliced what I found out later was my Achilles tendon, about 90 percent through. Couldn't walk for about 7-8 months. I lied to everyone as to how it happened.

I have depression. I didn't believe I did and I denied it, till my second year of college where my advisor forced me to go to the counseling center on campus. Now I have a school therapist and psychiatrist. I told my parents this year. My mom doesn't believe in it. My dad doesn't understand it.
He's very abusive still. Not so much physically, though he constantly threatens. More so verbally. And emotionally. He yells so much. He has a very short temper, and will start to yell at the top of his voice and insult and berate you even if you do something simple, like spill water on the floor.

I hate it. I hate it so much. I can't talk to him. He doesn't understand. I want to die and kill myself. I want to sooooo bad. He doesn't know I want to do it because of him. He knows that I have depression, but the only way he has ever acknowledged it is by joking about it. He even told me brothers and sisters against my wishes.

He always has to pick something wrong about me. He is just...so....mean! I can't stand this. It hurts really bad. And I don't know what to do. I can't leave because I still go to college and I have no means of financially being stable alone. I don't know what to do. I can't stand this.

I want help so badly. But I don't think there is anything or anyone that can help. My father will kill me one day, whether he realizes it or not.

I feel shameful/ashamed submitting this, because there are people here with much more serious problems than me. What they are going through seems so 'real' and my problems just seem to be a result of weakness and failure on my part. 

I'm 29 years old. I'm currently studying a year diploma to get back on my feet. This is after two years of unemployment, which included about 6 months of touring with a band that I had to quit due to too many injuries.

Previously I was studying a masters, which took me 2 years longer than the normal time to finish. I got the highest possible mark for that in the end. I was all set to make it in the academic world, but I burnt too many of my bridges. Part of this was due to my poor work ethic as a result of my depression and alcohol dependence.

I was unemployed partly due to the economic situation, and partly due to poor life choices, I think. I was forced to live at home with my parents who were quite harsh on me. In a way I don't blame them, how would you feel having your son who is in his late 20s still living off you? The town I lived in was small and conservative and everyone was quite open about judging me. Add to that it was one of those dead end towns where everyone is forlorn and hopeless. 

I smoked pot to cope, I always have. When I was in high school my parents told me that I wasn't depressed, even though it was quite clear that I was. They wouldn't allow me to go to therapy. Later in life I found that marijuana could help me cope. I relied on this in moderate amounts to medicate myself. I was once able to go onto antidepressants and they were great but my parents would constantly argue that I didn't need them. So I went back to marijuana. My parents see marijuana as bad as heroine. And they attributed my lack of a job to it. At the time my knees hurt so bad I couldn't walk, as well as my shoulder being dislocated. As much as I want to please them, I felt like killing myself and my depression was quite unbearable.

So I applied for this diploma and bank loan, but my parents offered to loan me the money instead and not have to pay interest. I agreed. I currently have two part time jobs and am barely making ends meet. 

I have been trying to improve my life. I exercise and eat healthy. I don't have a partner. My friends, both male and female, see me as a great guy and wonder why I dont have a gf. Despite this I feel as though I have nothing to offer a woman. 

I'm trying hard to sort myself out. But I feel so scared. Today I got given the wrong directions by train officials so hopped on the wrong train and missed a conference about resume writing and getting a job in the field my diploma is for. I'm terrified of not getting a job. Having to live off my parents. Being alone.

Her mom said that I deserved to know this. So after the initial shock of it all I asked very politely if they had already made funeral arrangements and if so where and when. Her response was

""Psh yeah I'm not telling you and don't ask anyone either because you are not welcome to her funeral. i just wanted to let you know that she had passed because she did still care about you.""

My ex and I dated almost 2 years. She cheated on me and slept with another guy. When she told me she cheated I said some cruel things. Nothing like I hope you die or anything but I did call her a slut out of anger. That was the last thing I said to her and I feel terrible about it now. 

I do care about her. We were each others firsts so part of me will always love her. But her mom won't let me to the funeral to pay my last respects because her mom doesn't know the full story of why we broke up. Her mom still thinks she is a virgin. So when I called her a slut all her mom knew was that she had left me for another guy, her mom didn't know she cheated on me or slept with me in the first place.
She still thinks her daughter was the innocent girl who never did anything and I won't tell her otherwise.

- Just got fired from my job.  Long story short, I was a nurse.  I sweat blood for this motherfucker.  I mean, put up with a lot of shit...like, one day had people screaming “die, faggot” at me while I tried to help someone who was spitting hepatitis-infected blood all over my face kinda shit.  I took a two-week vacation, and when I came back they'd fired me without really giving a reason.

- Oh, I'm gay.  So the “die, faggot” bit probably makes a little more sense now.  I also live in bum-fuck Egypt...the few friends I have are hours away.  Obviously, so are other gay people.  My longest relationship lasted like, two weeks, which is satisfying in a personal best kinda way, but in comparison to other people feels hopelessly inadequate.

- I've been fired from half of the jobs I've ever held.  I kinda have this bad habit of fucking up everything I lay my hands on, as near as I can figure...I work really hard, but apparently am just way incompetent.  The longest job I've ever held, I held because I was really good at covering up my complete lack of effort.

- I come from a long line of fuck-ups.  Honestly blocked out a lot of my childhood, but what I do remember was physical, emotional, and sexual abuse...which does sound kinda Oprah, I'll admit, but it's the truth, however melodramatic it may seem.  Mah Pops was the primary abuser.  My siblings are all following in his footsteps as well as they know how, as far as drug abuse and general lack of responsibility are concerned.  Mommy Dearest's just as traumatized as me, in her own way...a few months ago, I walked into her house to find her overdosed on benzodiazepines.  No forewarning...she just wouldn't answer the phone when I called, so I went inside and found her lying in her own piss screaming loud enough to be heard from the street. Not exactly Hallmark movie material...I just suppressed it as best I could, then went about with my daily activities.  Oh, and everyone else in my family hates me for not being a heterosexual redneck infant factory.

TL;DR:  My life's one huge fucking wreck.  If you want any more details, feel free to ask; I'll be awake, cutting myself and drinking, for at least another few hours.  My challenge is this:  if you can legitimately make me feel better...well, name your price.  I'll honor it...one of the few good things I can say about myself is that I keep my word.  If your naïve altruism can penetrate the horrors I've seen and lived, I'll do what you ask.  And if you think I'm hopeless and should kill myself, well, by all means, say so.

1364265605.0,21,self.MMFB,1b0nlq,The person I love the most is going through hard times and is shutting me out,22,1,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/1b0nlq/the_person_i_love_the_most_is_going_through_hard/,"Some background:

I’m a 24 year old guy who wasted most of his life away playing video games through highschool and most of college until a life changing experience changed my ways when I was 20. I tried to turn my life around and be more social. I made more friends, I attempted to get my first girlfriend many times over, but it was failure after failure. It started to get to me, I started to feel like I would be alone forever. Most girls just walked away when they found out I was a 20 something year old virgin.

The story:

Right before my 24th birthday I met a girl on a dating site. We went out on a few dates and had a lot of fun together. It started to blossom into a real relationship. I will admit things went really fast. She told me she did have some mental issues like depression and some of her exes affected the way she saw guys and stuff. They were real assholes to her in so many horrible ways. We talked about it here and there and I was ok with starting something with her. She just wanted to be up front with me. A few days before my birthday we were cuddling on the couch and one thing led to another and I lost my virginity to her. We talked about it for a long time beforehand and she wanted to make sure I was ready and all that jazz. She was really sweet about it.

From that point forward we were “official.” Awesome…first girlfriend and I lost my virginity, high five! From that point everything went fine for the next month or so, but I could tell she started to change a bit. She would get upset more often, she would get shorter with her texts, and she stopped wanting to have sex so much. She was about to start another job leaving her schedule with virtually no time for me according to her and I told her I was ok with it. Another week went by and we barley talked although I tried. Then one morning I get a strange phone call from her. Out of the blue she says she thinks we’re moving too fast and we need to slow down. I say ok…what do you want to do? She said we needed to stop having sex and kind of back up a bit and take things slow. I was ok with this although I couldn’t help but think something was up.

About two days later I get a text, she wants to meet up. As soon as I walked into the door I knew what was coming. She said she couldn’t date me anymore because she just had too many problems in her life. I won’t go into details, but it involves mental issues, family issues, past mental trauma from exes, not knowing where she was going in life, the list was pretty long. She said she was going to start going to therapy on a regular basis to try and help her along. She said she didn’t want to bring me down with her even though I said I supported her 100% and wanted to be by her side as she tackled her problems. As much as I pleaded with her it didn’t help. She did say that once she found herself and fixed her problems we may find ourselves together down the road. She walked out with me I bawled my eyes out as I gave her one final hug.

That wasn’t the end though. We still texted every day like nothing had happened. Sure we talked about us a little bit, but we tried to make it not weird. She knew I was feeling hurt so a few days into the breakup she said she would give it a try and stay in the relationship with me while she worked on herself. I saw her once during this time and it was really awkward the whole time and I kind of just got the vibe she got back together just to try and make me happy. Fast forward a couple of days and we had a fight about something really dumb and she said she couldn’t do it and we were done again.

We still text every day and she still calls me about every other day. I try to ask her how she is feeling, how her therapy is going, and questions about us, but she says I’m interrogating her and gets upset. So most of our calls consist of her venting to me about her day and me just listening. Every time she asks how I’m doing I don’t lie to her, I tell her I’m not doing well. I just want to be there to help her through this but she doesn’t want help. I love and care for her, but she wants none of it from me right now.

I end up really upset about every other day and cry a lot because I just can’t shake this feeling. She was my first girlfriend and I lost my virginity to her…I kind of expected to be with her for more than a few months.

I know exactly what I would tell someone if they were in my shoes right now. I would tell them to lay off, stop talking to her so much, and move on. Find another girl. But it’s so much easier said than done. I went the majority of my life with no girlfriend…I tried so many times. I wish I could find someone to move on with, but to me I’m in this rut with walls higher than Mt. Everest. I feel like I’m going to be forever alone for the rest of my life.

How do I feel better? Someone out there please just give me some ideas to let her go for the time being and enjoy my life because right now I feel like I’m walking around with this cloud of depression surrounding me and I can’t ever be happy about anything. I feel pathetic that I am so attached to someone that I only dated for a few months….I just don’t know what to do.

""Stupid slut, stay away from my boyfriend.""

It's true he cheated on her with me. I don't know if he told her or if she found out from scratchmarks. I feel horrible. She was my friend. But so is he and we've been friends for 6 years. We talk all the time and we're always there for eachother. I always try and help him. But we got drunk and he hopped on top of me. I said I didn't want to, to think of his girlfriend. To break up with her first. He danced with me and told me he loved me. I said this but eventually gave up and went with it. The sex was short and hurt.

I felt horrible but that doesn't excuse what I did. I knew he wasn't single. Now I have to face her at the mall when I want to bus somewhere. I have to know that I hurt someone so bad.

I never have done anything like that and urged him to talk to her. Hell he was saying shit to his ex when they were seeing eachother and made him fess up. He's not a terrible person, I care about him, but he's not ready to be in a relationship.

Then last night I saw a cute older guy. You know everyone has a fantasy of being with someone older and experienced. We got to a strip club, we make out and he buys me loads of stuff. He says how he loves being single and doing whatever. We come home. To his wife who tells me I have to leave and he's lying out of his ass. I cry and tell her I'm so sorry I didn't know. I felt so horrible I had no clue he was seeing anyone, he sdaid he was single. Now she has to deal with the fact her husband went to a strip club and brought home a girl half his age.

I feel so shitty like what the fuck is going on. I don't want to leave my house.

EDIT: I texted my friend asking to talk and he told me to go fuck myself and that I'm cut. Cause he told her the truth. I'm glad he told he but if she asks I'll tell her what I know happened.",,False,,t5_2sjdn,1358945402.0,,,True,t3_1734fk,http://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/1734fk/im_asshole_fuck_mmfb_please/,

I found out my girlfriend or 8 or 9 months, I don't remember, it was my longest relationship by far though, was cheating on me. With multiple dudes. She was a terrible girlfriend. But she got me to stay with a combination of making me feel like a human pile of shit who noone else could love, and more or less threatening suicide if I left her. Well I found out she was cheating and I left her. No suicide, she got with the guy she was cheating with. I'm single. While I feel confident in the decision I made, my self esteem and body image are shot. Ive never had good self esteem but I'm at an all time low here. I hate my body, I hate my face, I hate everything about myself. Noone ever says otherwise so I guess subconsciously that makes me think its more true.

My school work hasn't been great either. I go to a college prep school, and the work is hard, and I'm not smart. I take 2 AP courses and an advanced math and science course. Last I checked, I had an F in all four. I dont know what to do. Also, I have SATs and ACTs to take in the next 2/3 months. People keep asking what I want to do, but I honestly dont know. I graduate in 2 years, and I'm lost. I'm so alone. I dont know what i'm gonna do, and my parents keep telling me, each and everyday, ""As soon as you graduate, youre out on your ass"" and I have no idea and no prospects and I'm so scared. I have no usable skills or talents. I'm useless. I'm scared.

On top of that I'm severely depressed, a fact that my family refuses to acknowledge. Anytime I even begin to cry I'm told to ""Shut that shit up"" and take it elsewhere. Because of my bad grades, I can't text or call people, and the only means of communiqué I have with my ""friends"" is Facebook and Skype. Of course any and every time I even sit in front of the computer I'm told Ive been sitting there for hours playing video games and told to go do something real. This is coming from my Mr. Mom, ""work at home"" father, who if you checked his internet history would be full of Youtube clips of old SNL sketches and Amazon reviews. Coupled with that, very rarely am I allowed out. Not that I have anywhere to go.

My 9 year old brother is a prick. He knows he's the favourite child and he flaunts it. My parents buy him expensive gifts, and shower him with love and affection. I recently asked my mother if we could go to the store to buy new pants because several of the 7 pairs I own no longer fit. She told me ""You have money, buy it yourself."" The ""money"" that I have rounds out to about $20, money I got by saving lunch money by not eating. I can't drive either, she knows this. It's not like we're short on cash either. My mother is a well paid doctor.
I'm so alone, and so sad all the time and I dont know what to do. Its hard to put into words. I would never kill myself, but goddamn it sometimes I feel like thats what the world would rather me do. I'm so lost. My closest friends are my movies and reddit. im so alone

1355428113.0,20,self.MMFB,14su7a,My father figure and mentor killed himself. I am feeling very down about life in general. MMFB?,21,1,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/14su7a/my_father_figure_and_mentor_killed_himself_i_am/,"I did something dumb. I told one of my best friends that I liked her, even though she has a boyfriend (who's a big jerk) and I knew she felt that way about me because all her best friends told me she did. And they told me to tell her how I felt and I did and it was one of the best conversations we ever had. But then her psycho boyfriend flipped out and told her she couldn't talk to me anymore so we haven't spoken in a few months save for one text. It was a dumb move on my part and I regret it everyday, because I felt that this would happen but I listened to her friends and my own tell me to go for it because they all wanted to see her with a better guy.

So a few days after that happened, I come home and I find out that my Uncle, who is my godfather and also like a second father to me, killed himself. I still remember seeing my mom walk in. I had never seen her like that and I knew something was wrong. And she couldn't get the words out so every horrible thought flashed through my head. Was it my dad? My brother? I have never been more afraid for 15 seconds in my life. I can't get the images out of my head. I wrote and read a eulogy at his funeral and that was so painful. I just wanted to call my friend and talk to her, but I knew I couldn't. This is the third special person in my life I've had to see go within a year, and this one was so hard.

So I've spent the last few months very depressed. But I think I changed. I don't love myself, in fact I wake up every day and wish I was someone else. I have a very low sense of self-worth and I don't feel happy anymore, always asking if I'm good enough, and always answering that I am not. 

I drive to visit my uncle's grave all the time and just sit with him. He got to the point where he just couldn't take life anymore and he chose to end his. I feel that that would take away the pain I feel. I think about ending my life everyday and I struggle with deciding whether or not too. I feel like I am a burden to the rest of my family that is doing so well. My dad is doing so well at his job, and so is my older sibling, and my mom is running a very successful charity that helps people. I don't know if I'll be able to live up to them. I'm nothing, and I don't want to hinder their lives in any way so I think I would be best gone. 

I am moving back to the city where she lives in a month, and I really want to fix things with her. I feel horrible for screwing it up. I don't know what to do with my life though really. I'm really sorry for rambling and I really am sorry if I'm complaining too much. I don't know, I've never felt this way and I don't know what to do. I'm scared to talk to anyone because they'll think I'm just being dumb and immature.

Furthermore, it looks like I won't be going back to school this year, because my mother refuses to give me her tax information to file the FAFSA.

Nobody is doing anything to help me out. I'm 22... I don't know what to do in this kind of situation. I don't know what financial things I need to do. I don't have anyone to turn to.

I'm currently on high-school. The summer has started and I have no any friends left that I can just spend a great time. Year ago I met few awesome peopile, that turned out into a great friendship. I just tought, I'm so lucky with them and I felt so good. In that time me and my best-friend found each other our first girlfriends. I felt realy happy at the first months with her... We broke up some time ago. The thing is, that I heard my best friend was such an a***** and was lying to me and my other friends most of the time as we were going out. I was so dissapointed, that all the time we knew each other, he was telling us bullshit about other peopile, his situations etc. Tough, he tried to hit-up with my girfriend when we had some disagreements. Me and friends told him that it's enough and we weren't speaking to him at all. My classmate made a birthday party. Mostly everyone got drunk and it went out of control... My ex best-friend just started to tell llit about me, my ex-girlfriend and my last friends, so he revealed my secrets to mostly everyone out there at the party. He made some realy drunk guy punch me in the face for few times and made mostly every friend I had there hate me realy much even if some of them hated me a little before, now it turned out terribely. I felt so broke, that everyone at the party hated me for just becouse he revealed me secrets, tough he pranked them. A'right, I had some friends left, but now... After all the time when we were talking about that guy, how sick is him and what and as***** he was, they are talking again and beeing friends again. I can't go alright with the whole thing if the only friends I had, whose secrets were revelead by my ex-best friend who just made everyone hate me by liying, are again friends. So they basicly just don't give a thing about me - the situations that happened at the party and before. I won't forgive that to anyone. I just don't want to be in contact with them at all, but now I have no friends and for me it's hard to get new ones. The only ones I have are online friends that I met playing some games - they'r the only ones that I can talk about anything, but I have never seen them and probobly wont.

I'm fifteen. I have my own laptop and have had it since sixth grade. When I first got it, my very tech savvy parents put parental controls on it, which is understandable. I wouldn't let a sixth grader on the internet without some sort of protection now that I know what's out there. Since then I've obviously had my parental controls removed and as of late have enjoyed more or less unchecked access to the internet. My parents used to check out my history every once in a while but as I've grown older this has started to not be the case. Because of this, I have become complacent, not deleting my history and such. I have been frequenting 4chan's /b/ and /gif/ for a little over a year now. Because I had relatively free usage of the internet, that was pretty much okay and I didn't bother doing it in a private browsing tab or deleting my history. Pretty much the only time I ever used a private browsing window was to watch porn. 
   This would probably be all A-OK, but this morning I forgot to print out an essay that I had written over spring break for my AP world history class. I texted my dad and asked him to go on my computer and email it to me so that I could print it out at school. That went well and I was able to turn in my essay. In biology I was joking around with a friend (who also frequents 4chan) that I needed to be permabanned from 4chan because it was affecting my productivity. That's the funny part. When I got home today, I decided I wanted to see what was on /b/ this afternoon. Hello, what's this. K9 safe web parental tools pops up and informs me that I'm not allowed to access 4chan.org because it contains pornographic content. At this point I know I'm up a creek. I opened a new private tab to check some other sites, mainly pornhub and the like. All blocked by K9. I'm feeling pretty bad at this point. I guess when my dad used my laptop to email my essay, he poked around in my browsing history and found some 4chan stuff from yesterday and installed this parental control application. To make matters worse, I went on 7chan for the first time yesterday and explored some unsavory boards like /bestiality/ out of curiosity, shock, and horror. I definitely wasn't looking at horse porn for sexual satisfaction, but that's certainly the way it would look if someone glanced at my web history. I'm horrified to think that my dad may have seen that. I don't want my parents to think less of me. 
   My dad is really non-confrontational and hasn't brought it up. I wouldn't be surprised if he never did. I don't want to talk to him but I probably should. You can understand the mortification and sheer uncomfortableness of a conversation with your mom and dad explaining to them that all the fucked up shit that's I've seen is nothing bad and that I'm not into bestiality. It feels really bad man. Also, as icing on the cake, this K9 safety thing won't let me access imgur or youtube, so my other hangouts are now out of the question as well. I don't really know what I'm looking for posting here, but the subreddit's called make me feel better and that sounds good enough.

My problems can't even compare with most of the ones here. But the thing is: I was with my girlfriend at the mall, we were going home and went to catch a bus. Only the two of us on the stop, three guys came to us and announced the robbery.

I showed him my empty wallet, in an attempt to make him flee, but he searched my pocket and took my phone. A bus came by, so they didn't get the chance to do anything to my girlfriend. But the thing that is really bothering me is the fact that I didn't react. I am sure I would never let them lay a finger on her, but we could have easily run, or even turned our backs and walked. The kind of robbery was just that we were easy victims. They were in three, of course, but they wouldn't want to gather attention.

And, six years ago, it had happened the first time for me. They took my shoes and hoodie. Two guys. I was 12 and it haunted me for quite a good time, especially the fact that I just stood there, did as they told me. Even if they were unarmed.

And now, with the girlfriend I care so much and I couldn't do anything. I know it's the right procedure, so nobody gets hurt. I know that's what police encourages. But I can't help but feeling weak, and can't help but thinking that she is also thinking of me as weak. If she had just left, or if I was alone, I don't think it would have made that much impact. But the situation as it went, the feeling of impotence... :(

Help me feel better please.,22,2,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/qwf7s/i_am_21_and_in_a_great_deal_of_pain_help_me_feel/,"It will be 3 years this May since my cousin committed suicide. When he committed suicide I was 18 years old. We found out that he was on the way to the hospital 2 days after I had attended my high school graduation. I was coming of a big emotional high for me. I hated school pretty bad because I was picked on throughout most of my time in the school system. It let up once I made it to high school. I didn’t respond right to my cousin’s suicide. I turned it inward and am now suffering from it. I wasn’t even in the ER room when they pulled the plug. My mom was, my Grandma was, and another aunt was there. Of course his mom and sister and bum dad were there. His youngest brother was driving up from 6 hours away. We drew the short straws that day. He wasn’t there where my cousin (his brother) was ripped from us. I never got that chance to say goodbye like the rest of the family (along with my youngest cousin). The reason I got pulled from the room is because I tried to step out of the way when nurses were trying to enter the room in the beginning. I was trying to get out of the way, but apparently that was perceived as a sign that I didn’t want to be there because I couldn’t handle it. That is how I got left sitting in helplessly in a room the entire night. He had a rough life, there’s no doubt about it. I don’t think could take any more abuse. He ended up shooting himself in front of his mother, in a field leaning against a tree. The paramedics were able to revive him in the field, but…

Fast forward a few years and I now have an incarcerated uncle currently serving a 6 month stint for assault and he has a trial scheduled for the end of this month which could lead to an additional 2 years inside. All of this is due to the fact that he will not admit he has seizures from a fall that nearly killed him before I was even born. Couple that with an alcoholic enabling attention whore of a Grandma, who refuses to accept the truth and consistently waffles and you get a recipe for disaster. I don’t really know how many times I’ve heard the same story from her. She just won’t accept the truth. She also has this uncanny ability to play stupid. Of course this allows her the ability to make everybody else do everything for her. She even learned to drive in Chicago, on a manual transmission (Stick) no less, but refused to get a license so she could get a ride everywhere almost every fucking day. Of course this is my mom’s responsibility because my grandma wants nothing to do with me. In turn my grandma will no longer think or do anything without my mom.
This brings me to my mom. She has got to be the most caring/loving person I know. She is the only consistent parental figure in my life. She has to put up with my dad who is an alcoholic who spends most of his days ignoring/brushing us off. I am pretty sure he hates me to the core of his being. He never cares unless I’ve done something wrong. In his eyes I am to be seen and not heard; I am to be constantly busy, but be able to drop everything at a moment’s notice. He answers to no one and pawns his house responsibility on to my mom and I.

I used to be strong, but lately I have become thoroughly depressed and probably have anxiety. It seems as if everywhere I turn I see failure or everything I try to do ends in failure. I feel used on an extreme level. I still have a strong bond with my mom, but she is one person. As it is she has enough to deal with. I don’t want to burden her with my problems. With what she has had to endure, I feel it would only depress her more. I am in a tail spin and can’t seem to pull out of it.

The sad truth is that if anyone in my family finds out I posted this because they magically found this I have no fucking idea what the hell would happen, but I wouldn’t doubt that it would end in a long ear bleeding lecture on how you keep your problems to yourself. Lord knows I’ve heard it before.

TL;DR = Lost a family member to suicide, have incarcerated uncle due failure to admit medical problems, and an alcoholic enabling Grandma that lives a la-de-Fucking-da lifestyle where she gets everyone to do everything for her by playing stupid. I only acknowledge one parent (my mom). My alcoholic dad hates me.

Although really this isn't so bad, just like, I keep replaying it over and over again in my head and I don't feel any better about it. 

I consider myself an above average guitar player. I know that like a bazillion people play, and I know they all think they're good, but really this is something I've devoted years of my life to because I genuinely enjoy it. Besides my close friends, most people don't even know that I play at all because I typically don't showcase it. 

Anyway, those friends have really been encouraging me to play in front of people, so last night I played a very short set in front of a crowd of about 40 people, most of whom I had never met. It was a ghastly performance. I was very nervous, and in my stage fright I played really poorly and I forgot a lot of lyrics. I tried to play it off like it wasn't a big deal and kept going, but it was so  obvious. I started losing the crowd after the first song. It's really discouraging to be up on stage and see the audience just chatting with each other and looking bored. 

I know that if I don't take pride in my work then nobody else will, but the thing is that I take great pride in my work. I am very proud of it. But for some reason it all falls apart when I try to share it with anyone I'm not intimately close to. It's really frustrating to fail at something I know I can do, and have done countless times before because of nerves. I don't know how to get over stage fright besides getting back on stage and getting used to it, which part of me really wants to do. But it was such an embarrassing thing for me that another part of me just wants to withdraw.  

All of my friends told me I did well, but I think they were just being nice. They are the people who have heard me at my best, and they know I can do better. And I know I can do better. 

Ugh. I know this isn't even close to being a big deal in comparison to other things here. But for me it was just an incredibly mortifying experience, and I  can't shake the embarrassment.

Feeling horrible.,27,5,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/q7990/any_horribly_embarrassing_drunk_stories_to_share/,"I went to a professional meeting, where there happened to be a fuck ton of famous individuals in my field attending, schmoozing, and going over some important plans for the future.  Afterward, we all hit the bar.  Excessive drinking happens to be... common in my field.  Work hard, party hard.  But I tend to be the ""responsible"" person at these events.  I've been the one herding people back to their hotel rooms on more than one occasion.

This time it was different, as I had my confidence bolstered by making some damn important connections and received a whole pile of business cards out of this meeting.  I'm a really shy person with social anxiety, so this victory was new for me.  I was all starry eyed about getting a more important position, possibly a new career.  Cue me drinking more, talking more, and really getting on fire.  Then I hit that point where I was one drink over my personal limit.  I was sloppy drunk.  And then there were free shots being bought for me.  Maybe some shots being fed to me by a new acquaintance.  I have *never* drank like this.  Annnnnd I went over the deep end...

A friend called me earlier today and said that some awkward comments were made about how ""way drunk"" I was by a colleague.  Apparently I was ""getting intense"" with probably the biggest name at the bar, approaching him over and over again to try and get a friend hired with his department (already apologized to her for that).  Shit.  The worst part was that an ex of mine randomly texted me in the middle of the night (I didn't text first.  As fate would have it, the ex was insanely drunk too and sent me messages which I interpreted as mean spirited).  Yup.  There was drunk crying.  A lot of it.  FML.

Now I'm in that awkward hungover moment thinking... fuck.  A week's worth of work making connections possibly swept away by a few hours of tequila shots.

**tl;dr Never drinking at professional events like that ever again.**

I want to crawl into a hole and die of embarrassment.

My father has been a minister for the majority of my life, and now manages a university's IT service to students. I started attending public school in 7th grade, which started an incredible downward spiral back to earth... because I'd been sheltered.

I've never been a great student, and almost failed nearly every class I've ever taken at least at some point, before being forced to bring the grade up by my parents. I was born in the same town I went to the latter half of middle school and high school in, but didn't live there *until* 7th grade. So in turn, I had no friends until I made a few in middle school and in the high school band, and stuck with them ever since. However, these are the only real friends I have. They got me through high school, along with being in the band.

I dated twice. Period. Once in middle school that was a result of my stupidity at the time and no real love was involved on my part, nor did relationships matter in middle school. Later, I dated a girl in high school, less because I loved her, and more because I felt sorry for her. She'd lost her mom, and was stuck in a terrible family situation. She'd been obsessed with me for a while, and I didn't realize it until we started dating. I was a miserable SO. I always found reasons we couldn't go somewhere and be together. I finally broke up with her because I was doing more harm than good. Now, I've got a *huge* crush on one of my closest friends, who's already told me that every time a friend reveals they have interest in her, it greatly upsets her. She's ridiculously shy and has anxiety issues worse than my own. I really don't want to fuck it up. So I'm terrified of even making a move.

Since I've always been a bit of a musical individual, I'd been playing piano and bass for a long time by the time I hit high school, and proceeded to pick up vocals and the guitar. I was apparently good with them, and I found out a couple of my friends played guitar/bass too. We set out to create a band of our own, and still haven't really gotten anywhere. It's been three years. I'm almost ready to start looking somewhere else for a band, but I'm convinced I'll never make it. My voice is too low to be considered good for rock, and gives out too quickly, despite being strong to begin with. I'm fairly clean on guitar, until you tell me to start playing the best I can, and my left hand doesn't want to cooperate with my right. I've been playing for almost five years and I still can't get that right. I practice all the time and I never seem to improve. I have stuff I've recorded myself on [SoundCloud](http://www.soundcloud.com/benreaves), but I can't make myself happy with any of it, and the best stuff is hard for me to reproduce now. No one I know or that can help me start up expresses any real interest in it.

Recently I graduated my high school with top honors. I was in the class of 2011. Most of my friends graduated with honors as well. I was the only one that got accepted to a university's honors program. The university is in the same town that I went to high school in, and I still live at home to save money (we can't afford tuition AND housing). I proceeded to start badly in ALL of my classes, and became really anxious about them. Each time I made a mistake, it got worse. Once, I turned in a topic proposal to have it ripped to shreds by the teacher in my honors composition class. Eventually I was afraid to even go to class. At the end of the semester, I had a 0.54 GPA. This put me on academic probation and I was no longer permitted to take honors classes. I accidentally missed my advisement appointment and got so fucked in the registration process that I came out with only 8 credit hours, as opposed to the 14 I was taking the first semester. I started off badly in those classes as well, forgetting a paper and a textbook.

Then, shit got real. The lack of hours decreased my financial aid enough to cause me to owe over $1500 that I didn't have. My schedule was cancelled. I don't know if I'm going to be able to take classes in the fall or not. And the longer I wait to get an education, the harder it's going to be to pay for it.

Through all this at the university, I've held a student job as a technician in IT services, relevant to my major. I'm no longer a student, but I still have the job. So this concerns me if I can keep the job. Because when I lose it, I can no longer pay for gas in my car (which needs repairs I can't pay for), subscriptions I've begun, or anything I've wanted for the past five years my parents wouldn't buy me (because we didn't have the money, or they were just being dicks).

I'm really no good at anything other than music production or some IT work (even in that area I'm just okay). So any job I get without landing it at the local music shop--which I've already learned will not hire me as a producer or engineer--is going to suck and it'll only make things worse.

I got extremely scared when my family asked me what my final grades were... so I lied and told them I had the makings of a solid 3.8. It's what they wanted to hear. It's what they expected of me. I appear as the guy that has it all together to literally *everyone* but my closest friends, who either aren't any help or are becoming abrasive.

I've also nearly lost my religion, which I'm not sure is a bad or a good thing. My entire family is Christian and I was once too, but I'm not so sure anymore.

That thing about everyone thinking I have it all together? Yeah. Most people truly believe that. A lot of people actually assume so because they don't care. No one cares about me, it seems. And it's becoming more and more that way with my closest friends. I rarely get to hang out with them, because they have other things to do... and I've already told them what shit I'm in.

Throughout high school, especially senior year, I felt non-human. Often I wished I was something else. Now, I'm feeling like I'd be better off if I just fell into a coma and never woke up, or even died. At the same time, though, that scares me. I don't want to die, but I have no reason to live.

All I ever wanted was to feel like I mattered. I wanted to have worth. I wanted to be loved, too. But now I'm finding that I don't matter, that I'm worthless. And there's not a shot at love, because no one really loves their partner anyway.

TL;DR - My entire existence has constantly been challenged, and now I've made a huge series of mistakes that I didn't have (nor could have) the wisdom to prevent.

1329045712.0,23,self.MMFB,plykf,I can't seem to get my life together... I'm burnt out,24,1,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/plykf/i_cant_seem_to_get_my_life_together_im_burnt_out/,"**Abstract:  /firstworldproblems**

This past year has been rough (I'm 25, for context).

1) I joined AmeriCorps after 4 months of unemployment.  It's something.  I've really grown as a person and gained a lot of skills.  But I'm tired of feeling ashamed when I use my food stamps at the grocery store.  I'm tired of low income housing.  I'm tired of working 60 hours a week at my work site for less than minimum wage.  Management has been preoccupied with conflict and things falling apart, and it's been trickling down into my job.  I hate working there now.  I'm also really sad that I feel like my career of choice is slipping away from me.

2)  Speaking of low income housing... I'm sick of getting ripped off by both my landlord and the building manager, who I found out was overcharging me for internet so he could make a profit off me and my neighbors.

An upstairs neighbor also tried to break into my bedroom in the middle of the night after harassing me for the past few months.  My landlord feels sorry for him (he's an addict with nowhere else to go) so he's still living here.  Landlord even tried to guilt trip me for complaining about it.  I regret not calling the cops now.  I bought a stungun.  I'm trying to move, but with my budget it's comparable to wrestling a pig covered in KY in a pit of razor wire to find a place that isn't a crack den.

3)  I can't get a job in what I studied (forensic science) for the life of me.  I have a Master's degree and a couple of years of experience volunteering in labs.  I get the door slammed in my face by HR for more qualified applicants, read: ""We want someone with a chemistry BS and 5+ years of **paid** experience.  Fuck off.""  State budget cuts causing hiring freezes doesn't help either.

4)  I keep trying to get into other jobs, but I am at a loss.  Even Starbucks doesn't seem to want me.

5)  I hate the city I currently live in.  I miss my old city.  Sometimes, there's actual tears over missing it so much.  I wish I could afford to move somewhere else, but yeah... AmeriPoor.  Instead I'm stuck in this city, in this job, being bored to death.

6)  Mostly friendless.  I moved across the country for this AmeriCorps position.  And it's hard to make friends with the hours I work and I have zero connections in the area, outside of the person mentioned in #7... :(

7)  I've been strung along for 2 1/2 years by the person I love (in love, romantic squishy I-want-your-strictly-hypothetical-babies love).  We met a few years ago, became friends, dated, then became long-distance, and then reconnected when I moved out here.  I hoped things would be different once distance was no longer a problem for us, but it's not.  He's in a transitional state in his life, too.  He's starting his own company and is overworking himself to get it to run.  I've asked if he needs me to help him with anything, letting him know that I'm here if he needs me, etc.  I've poured a lot of my energy into providing him with emotional support when he needs it.  Despite the fact that he says he loves me, we're not in a relationship and I'm facing the fact that there's no room in his life for me.  It's pretty crushing, especially considering that I've invested so much into this non-relationship.

I've never paid attention to Valentine's Day, but this year I have been thinking about how nice for once it would be just to get flowers from someone.  Even if it's just from a friend.  I've never had that before.  I don't know.  Lately I've really been craving appreciation.

8)  I can't use reddit meetups to make friends, as the guy in #7 is really active in them and has effectively banned me from attending, as it's ""his social circle.""  Sigh.

9)  Health problems.  Thankfully, I have insurance through AmeriCorps, but I am really worried about being able to afford any co-pay on things.

10)  I'm worried about my car.  It's on its last legs and I'm required to commute and travel for my job.  It's... ahhh.  I need it to hold together.  Even if I have to duct tape the poor thing together, I need this car to keep running.  I actually did use super glue and some foam to jimmy a fix for the brake light switch.

11)  Got rejected from the PhD programs I applied to.  So that door is closed to me for at least the next year, and I dread going through the process again.

12)  I am terrified, absolutely terrified, of being unemployed again when my term of service via AmeriCorps ends in August.

1328370535.0,23,self.MMFB,paovr,Remembering a friend lost last night,26,3,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/paovr/remembering_a_friend_lost_last_night/,"I just need to work it out a little, and writing helps me organize my thoughts. I thought this was the most appropriate subreddit to do a little storytelling about my friend. I don't really expect you to read it all the way through, it's quite a wall of text, I just need to get it out.   

Last night, my friend passed away from this life and home to the Lord. To put it simply, I have never met someone so loved by so many people. I spent the last two days in the hospital in the ICU waiting area. At any given time of the day there could have been 15 - 20 people there sitting and waiting and trying to do what we can for his wife. When the news spread that he was on the very brink of passing, by my estimation, no less than 80 people came to see him. Honestly, I felt a little bad about how much real estate we were taking up; people literally lined up down the hall for a chance to say goodbye to him. I wondered how frequently the hospital saw a literal crowd of well-wishers for a single patient.  

Now, let me tell you about my friend. He's a great guy. I don't think it's possible for anyone to meet him and not like him. He was the truest example of a Christian I've ever known. He loved God and Jesus so much and he wore it on his sleeve. He was never pushy or pretentious about it, he just simply exuded it out of his very being. He didn't just wear it, he lived it. He was so loved by others because he heaped love, openness, and kindness upon everyone he ever came across, and it was infectious. He had a an unending child-like innocence and enthusiasm to him. 

He loved to cook and eat, especially for and with others. People were welcome to just drop by at his house anytime for a meal. And a meal wouldn't just be something like instant noodles. Oh, no. A meal would consist of pasta, salad, soup, fish, ribs, and steak. The dude went all out for food. If we went out to eat, he'd try different things, or at least have us try something we'd never had before. The last time I went out to eat with him, we had ramen noodles with squid ink soup. It wasn't new for him, but it was new for me. After he had cancer, he used to have the most hopeful, then pitiful expressions when he asked his wife if he could eat something he knew he shouldn't eat and she said no. She kept a strict eye on his diet, but at the same time usually threw him a bone and let him have just one bite, though, and he would savour that one bit so very, very much.   

And it didn't stop there either. He and his wife are so generous with food. Not just serving it, but ever since I was in school, they always paid the bill. At first, my similarly-aged friends and I protested and tried to pay for ourselves, but they always told us ""When you're working, then you get to pay us back. But right now we're working and you're still in school."" Eventually we learned to stop resisting. Then I got my first full time job out of school, and I took them out to the Keg to eat. What did they do? They paid the bill. I couldn't fight them off because they were seasoned pros, I had no chance. Eventually I had to come up with with some strategies. This included simple ones like quickly snatching the bill before they could. More involved ones included leaving cash in the car console and calling them afterwards to tell them where it was, and excusing myself from the table to go to the washroom, and actually going to the cashier and pay. That one was my favourite, and they came to call it ""Pulling a [my name]"". (And then they did it themselves on other friends who were equally as bill-grabby.)

He also loved to build Gundam models. He'd collected boxes and boxes of them, but never had the time to build them. You see, he worked as a pastor before he became sick, and when you're a pastor, especially one like him, you have an extremely busy schedule. When he got cancer 5 years ago and was forced to take a leave from work, he finally had the time to build his Gundam models. Oh, but he loved those models. He spent hours building and painting them. They were one of the silver linings he managed to find in the long, tiresome journey of his illness. Building the models helped him keep his mind off how terrible chemo and radiation therapy made him feel. But it wasn't just a distraction, it was a real passion. He knew everything about those Gundams. He'd light up whenever he talked about them, and I had no clue what he was going on about, but I let him go because he was so happy to. (Secretly, his wife hated the models, because to her, they were, in a way, the fruits of his illness. So she never wanted to hear about them, even if she tolerated their existence.) 

He enjoyed camping and being outdoors and going on roadtrips with his wife. He was always very curious, collected random nicknacks, and yellow was his favourite colour. He wore lots of yellow. The walls in their house are painted various shades of yellow. Yellow made him happy, because it reminded him of that generic yellow happy face. The man even had yellow overalls. Where do you even get yellow overalls???? When he was diagnosed with cancer for the third time, he knew his chances of seeing the other end of it was slim. He told us that if he died, he didn't want us to wear black at his funeral, he wanted us to wear something colourful. I can already imagine that it will be a sea of yellow that day. It's kind of a ridiculous picture, isn't it? But that's just who he is, and what will become a part of his legacy.

I think the most amazing thing about him was how he connected with everybody. Small children love him. Insufferably cocky teens love. His peers love him. And the elderly especially love him. He really got kids. Ministering to kids was his passion. He could really get down to a kid's level and really communicate with them. He was even caught up on the latest toy fads and kids TV shows. I've never been sure if he was caught up so he could talk about it with the kids, or if he was caught up because the kids told him all about it. 

His completely non-judgmental openness and gentle way of mentoring people let teens connect with him. You know the kids who're too cool for you? The I'm really awesome kids? Yeah, they were there too, sitting right alongside the kinda awkward and dorky kids in the hospital, waiting to say goodbye. He was so real and genuine and never talked down to anyone, and it was so subtly powerful that he brought people down to that level too. He listened intently no matter what you had to say, and if you had an issue, he'd give you the wisdom of his experience if you wanted it. But mostly, he was just so fun that you just wanted to play too, and you can't be a pretentious teen or snobby adult and play. You have to be like a kid to play, so he managed to get everyone's inner-child out. 

He was so kind, thoughtful and respectful that the elderly loved him too. In the hospital, his mother in law was lamenting how her friends always told her what an excellent son in law he was. Oh, I know he had a few gripes and annoyances with them, but he was gentle about it and usually just let them have their way if it was simply just a difference of opinion. He and his wife welcomed them into their home when they moved here. He took them out to eat. When an additional car was needed, he bought a new car and gave it to them and kept the old one for himself. His MIL said she knew he was good to them and she loved him like he was her own son. She didn't even see her son very much, but he was always there (well, I mean, living in the same house and all).

Oh, and he loved his doctors and nurses too. I mean, by no means was he ever thrilled about seeing them, because the need to see them meant there was something wrong that needed fixing. But he appreciated them so much for all they did for helping him. He didn't just tell them so, he'd show them his appreciation in the form of food. He and his wife got them coffee, snacks, and  chocolates. I visited him in the hospital last week, and I don't think there was a single nurse who walked by without saying hi to him and his wife.

I am trying to think of a negative thing about him. It's like one of those trick questions on interviews: What is your biggest weakness? And then you have to answer in a way that's actually a positive. That's actually the only kind of answer I can come up with. He'd work too hard and exhaust himself. They were too generous. (Not that it put them in a compromising financial situation, but we wanted to treat him back!) That's about all I can come up with. I'm probably biased. (Maybe.) 

The last five years have been hard on him and very especially his wife. He was diagnosed with cancer one, twice, and three times. He was actually so close this time. His FB picture is him with his new oxygen tank the first day he got home from his latest surgery to remove cancerous tumours. The surgery (+past surgeries +chemo&amp;radiation) had left him with so little viable lung he needed it to breathe at night. But even so, what does he do? He poses with it with a grin and a peace sign. He was home for about two days before he was taken to the ER for shortness of breath. He'd gotten pneumonia, and given his extremely decreased lung function, this was life threatening to him. He was put on a ventilator because he couldn't breathe on his own anymore. Despite the antibiotics and whatever else he was put on, he went into sepsis. His organs shut down and, two days later, finally his heart did too. He was with family. 

As a favour to him, and to me, please get your annual checkup done regularly. I know it's so temptingly easy not to, but try to eat well and stay healthy.  

Goodbye, my old friend.

I don't have a great past. Broken family life, financial struggles. I was in an abusive relationship for three years that ended only after he proceeded to rape me. I've struggled with depression, self-injury, and eating disordered behaviors. I've been in and out of therapy and hospitals.

Finally, I'm starting to make progress. At nineteen, I live with my significant other, work two part-time jobs and attend community college full-time. I pay my own bills and take care of myself. I take my medication regularly, and have stopped cutting and purging.

I was on children's Medicaid. It was revoked two weeks ago, on the grounds that I make too much money (I make about $850/month). I can no longer attend therapy and will soon run out of medications. My car broke down, and it will cost more to fix than the car is actually worth. My abusive ex has attempted to contact me, dragging me back into old thought patterns. My hours at work have been cut drastically; next week, I work a total of nine hours. 

I want to cut. I want to lock myself away where no one can ever get to me, where no one can ever hurt me again. I know I have it pretty good; I'm not starving, I have a place to live.

* I have been out of work since August of 2010. I am 46 years old, I have no **documentable** skills, no college degree. I have applied and/or sent resumes to over 200 different places with **zero** success.

* I need a place to live after the divorce is final (February 1st). We own a house, but for obvious reasons I need to move out.

* After the divorce is final, I can no longer be carried on my wife's health insurance; this is disastrously bad news for me since the antidepressant that I take so that I can function costs $360 per month if I don't have coverage.

My mother I would rather have nothing to do with. I don't ever want to see her fucking face again.

I just... hate... almost everything right now.

I'm glad I have my boyfriend... but when he's gone, I can't stop crying because my mind keeps floating.

I can't stop crying.

I don't like feeling hopeless. I'm doing the best I can to find work...

We're living in a very small space - four rooms, tightly packed - so there isn't much room for three small kids to bounce around. I don't mind them jumping ON the bed but I do have issues with them jumping OFF of it. We have this discussion on a daily basis. Sometimes I have to lock them out of the bedroom. Today, the bedroom was locked most of the day.

About an hour ago, they were playing in the bedroom, and all three came out yelling and crying. Our oldest had jumped off the top of the mattress and landed on his knees in the doorway, on top of a metal strip bolted into the floor - and one of the bolts cut a gash into his knee about an inch long.

I thought at first Oh, no big deal, we'll just put a Band-Aid on it. But then, looking at it, I realized it was WAY too deep for a Band-Aid. My husband was freaking out, literally running in circles, cursing.

We wrapped a hand towel around his leg, elevated it and put pressure on it. We got him dressed.. he likes to run around in his underpants at home.. and we found him his favorite Batman shirt to wear. I hugged him and told him to be brave, and explained what the doctors were likely to do, and told him it would hurt but not for long. And he and his dad went to the hospital.

Several years ago, our oldest hit his little brother in the face with a toy car, and the hospital called CPS. I was stuck at the hospital under supervision in my little boy's room for four days until a worker could come out and allow us to be released. This lead to six months of routine visits from CPS, accusations (not allegations but flat-out accusations to my face) of child abuse, and phone calls from a caseworker that left me in tears. It was extremely frightening, unnecessary, and stressful.

I'm terrified that this is going to happen again. I'm scared that CPS is going to find fault with us for this, and threaten to remove our children - or actually do it. Because we're poor and we're struggling. 

We're actually in the midst of a CPS case right now because our oldest was going to school reporting he had no food at home. We have food - not much, but we get by - and he's a picky eater, so when it gets down to Ramen noodles or rice and beans, he refuses to eat.

This time the caseworker is actually helpful, and doesn't try to make me cry. She understands we're working to find jobs and trying to fix the problems with our food stamps. I have no concerns about those allegations because I know we're doing everything we can to fix the issue.. but I've been treated like an offender without cause in the past, and I'm concerned it might happen again.

I keep trying to tell myself everything will be fine. He'll get stitches in his knee and he'll come home and everything will be all right. But there's this fear..

Help. :(

**EDIT: Thanks for the support, everyone! My little guy got stitches and is now safely home again, tottering around like an old man with a broken hip (not from pain but from awareness of the injury). Apparently he was calm and brave at the hospital and went through the whole ordeal without freaking out - a major accomplishment from such a hyper-reactive guy!

Finished out the 100% SoCo tonight. Damn it hits me hard. Every time.

Sitting in my kitchen, it's overcluttered. Everything from my minivan is here, because it died at the weekend. Silver lining to that cloud - it was being written off anyway due to a crash for which I was not responsible. I have the cheque - I have yet to bank it. We'll see if it clears.

I wanted to go and see CSS play tonight but passed because it's been raining all day and i don't want to drive in this crap.

Nobody offered to accompany me to counseling. My father didn't come out to see me. Nobody has even asked if I'm okay.

And christ, I know how selfish and jealous and juvenile this sounds, but when I was in the hospital for something similar 2-3 years ago, nobody visited me, sent me flowers or offered to help.

College grad, applying to grad schools, living at home, generally depressed. I guess what's most relevant is the fact that I've never been in a relationship. I've had some repeat hookups, but that's about it. This is really contributing to how naive I feel about the situation.

So, my friends convinced me to join OKCupid. Kind of on a lark, because they thought it was funny. So I did. I went out with a grand total of two guys. The second guy I met, I fell for. 

On our first ""date"" our conversation seemed so natural- not awkward at all. He was way cuter in person, smart and successful. We only met for a little over an hour before parting ways, and to be honest I wasn't really convinced I would hear from him again.

The next day, I get a text saying how much of a great time he had and how he would like to see me again. We made plans for the following night, a Friday. I met him and ended up having SO much fun. We went to a few bars and got a little tipsy. He kissed me at the end of the night.

A few days later he took me out to dinner, and this went on and on. He told me I was pretty, held my hand, paid for all my shit (even when I begged him to split it). We had sex around the fourth date. At this point, he still seemed totally interested, sending me texts like ""when am I going to see you again?"" and wanting me to meet his friends, etc. He told me I was the only girl he was seeing.

Being so unexperienced in relationships, I was over the moon. Even my coworkers were telling me how much happier I seemed. Then, slowly, he began to pull back. 

After about a month and a half, we fell into a pattern of only seeing each other about once a week, never on weekends. He was ""busy"" a lot, where he used to have all the time in the world for me. I pulled back as well, not wanting to seem needy. He would still take me out and be very sweet to me but would rarely text me other than to make plans and there was no more talk of meeting friends. 

This lasted another three months. I knew something was wrong, but didn't know what to do. We hadn't had a proper relationship talk, but I liked this guy SO, so much I didn't want to ruin anything. I told him I was starting to really like him; he told me he liked me, too.

One morning I found a long, brown hair in his bed. I'm a blonde. I left his apartment and immediately started crying.

A few weeks later, I finally gathered my courage and asked him what he was hoping to get out of ""this."" Needless to say, he told me he didn't really want anything serious and was happy just hanging out with me like we had been (and having sex, obviously). We ended up ""breaking up,"" mostly at my request. I was devastated. He didn't want to talk about it.

Now I'm just trying to deal with all of the emotions I'm feeling after this. I just feel so **stupid**. Like, I actually thought he liked me. Even worse is the thought that maybe he liked me at first, but then lost interest after getting to know me. He was likely hooking up with other girls as well. I should probably get tested. Being so naive about relationships, I just assumed I had finally found something worthwhile.  I'm really broken up over this. 

I'm also idealizing him and putting all the blame on myself. Like, maybe I should lose five pounds and then he'll want me back, as his girlfriend this time. Stupid, stupid, stupid. I don't know how to stop this self-hate and stop hoping I'll run into him and he'll ""take me back"".

I just feel so used. 

Sorry for the stream of consciousness, I was hoping writing this out would make me feel better. 


**EDIT: Thanks, y'all. Your comments have actually given me a lot of perspective and things to think about. I'm still hurting, but even though it seems like it's the end of the world I'm sure I'll be okay eventually.

Of course, I'm not **really** going to kill myself. Mostly because I fear death too much. That's it. If I wasn't afraid to die, I would've fucking done it. The only people brave enough for suicide are the cowards.

In any other circumstance, if she had just ended our relationship, I would still be upset, but I would be fine. The fact that she fucking cheated on me, though... it makes me angrier than I knew possible. I gave her **everything** and in return all I get is impending sadness.

 So here's my deal: I'm a second semester senior in college and I'm going nuts. I go to a school where everyone is required to do a senior project/thesis, and I'm a double major, so that means I'm doing two. One is for dance, which requires us to choreograph two pieces (one per semester) of about 10-15 mins length, and a paper that's 20-30 pages. My other is for philosophy and the project is a paper of 65-125 pages. I knew what I was getting myself into when I decided to double, so I know I'm the only one to blame for that...and there's no way I'm quitting one when I'm this far along.

The dance project I'm not so worried about. It's my philosophy project that's really starting to drive me mad. Before I left for break I had about 35 pages written, which isn't bad, but I didn't do as much work as I should have over break (re: I did nothing) and since being back I feel like I've just been running in place. Mostly I've just been mentally flipping out about this thing. It's due in 70 days, and I have to read a ton of books for my research (mostly, I just need more quotes and references put in since I have almost none). I've read a few, but really not much. Obviously, I should have started reading these texts a while ago, but my focus before was getting all my existing ideas out on paper and such, plus...reading for school is the thing I'm literally worst at. I'm that person who immediately has 200x more trouble reading something once it's assigned for a class. Plus philosophy readings are hard and take time. But it needs to be done! But I'm having so much trouble doing it. I still have 2-3 chapters of my project that I haven't even begun writing. Usually I see my project adviser every week, but haven't seen him since being back, and we have a meeting tomorrow, and I have to tell him that I've basically done nothing worthwhile since we last spoke in December. And it's almost March! Ahhhhhhhhhhggg.

Another issue is that because I'm a double major, I have double the requirements. I have requirements of the school (which are a lot), the requirements of a dance major (surprisingly a lot), and the philosophy department too. So basically, while all the other seniors are taking one or two classes this semester, I'm taking five, and so all that schoolwork is factored in too. Plus I'm in two other dance pieces. I feel like I can't juggle this all, and especially not while keeping my sanity. I don't want to turn into a hermit and stop going out/seeing my friends...mostly because I know this would probably make me horribly depressed. But I need to get more work done and I need a way to make myself do it. And I need a way of feeling okay missing out on partying/going out on some weekends. Right now it just feels like I'm not doing anything productive enough (although I have been trying to do some work every day) or like anything I'm doing just isn't enough. I feel like I've lost track of my train of thought with this project and am afraid I won't find it again. Basically I'm just super anxious about how the hell I'm going to finish this thing and I feel like I'm going absolutely insane. A couple minutes ago I actually started crying in the library. I know this is probably very trivial compared to a lot of posts here but if you have anything encouraging or helpful to say I would really appreciate it.

During my last two years of high school, I began to branch out and I made a few friends with whom I am still close. 

Then freshman year of college happened, and I somehow managed to have a lot of friends - it was the first time in my life that I had an active social life, and it became really overwhelming. Out of all of these friends, there were two girls whom I considered my best friends, and we hung out every day and became really close. I'm now in the second semester of my sophomore year, and neither of these girls go to college with me anymore. The large number of friends that I used to have has gradually dwindled down, until last semester I was hanging out with only one small group, but now, even they have stopped returning my texts and inviting me out and I don't know what I did. I just feel like everyone has left me and I've never been so alone before. 

My mom called me yesterday and asked what I did over the weekend, and I told her that I went to a party and went sledding, even though I just stayed in my dorm wondering why no one wants to hang out with me anymore. She knew I was feeling lonely and it made her so happy. I just couldn't stand the thought of her thinking that I had gone back to being a friendless loser.

Earlier this year I made the decision (under a doctor's care) to withdraw from psychiatric medications for a bunch of reasons that I still stand by today. I'd been coping pretty damn well, and then a bunch of shit got piled on me (boyfriend went overseas with the military, lost my job, family issues, possibly an eating disorder) and the stress is making me symptomatic.

I basically have this fucking Greek chorus of...I don't want to say voices, because with the knowledge that I have a thought disorder, that sounds like I'm hallucinating, and I'm definitely not. But it's like a bunch of internal monologues going on at any given moment, and they're all goddamn bullies. It's like getting picked on by a group of people who follow you around at all times, know every secret, every thought, every insecurity you have, and they exploit all these things in their criticism. 

Even the stuff I see as a personal victory isn't safe at this point. I got a job and was really excited about it (after three years of being disabled I felt super pumped that I'd even felt up to putting in an application) and posted something about it on Facebook. About 30 people ""liked"" the post, and I was in full-on celebration mode when the monologue started up. ""What the fuck are you so happy about? You got a job as a goddamn barista. You're going to be making coffee for people. Anyone can do that, fuck, anyone can do that in their sleep. Your sister's a medical assistant and your boyfriend is Defending Our Freedom and you're excited to be making lattes for minimum wage? You're pathetic. Look at all these people who are congratulating you -- they feel sorry for you. They know what a fuckup you are and they're trying to be encouraging about your sorry excuse for a job because they know it's all you can even handle right now. They're not excited for you, they pity you because you have no ambition and will never amount to anything in life. You might as well kill yourself now, you don't have any purpose or worth, just give up and spare everyone the misery of having to deal with your dumbshit ass for the next 40 years.""

It's like this with everything. Every move I make, everything I do or don't do gets me screamed at by these fucking demagogues in my head. I can't do anything to please them, and even when other people wrong me, they find a way to make it into my fault because I'm a worthless sack of shit. There's a monologue for everything that's going on, sometimes there are five or six at once, and I can fight one off but the rest just get louder. 

This has been with me constantly throughout my life since I was a child, even before I started showing thought disorder symptoms. This summer was good for me, I had a bunch of awesome stuff happen, stress level was lower than it's been in years, and as a result the monologues were quieter and found less to criticize. But then, like I said, I hit a stressful period, and it's ramped up until it's the worst I've had to deal with it in recent memory. 

I can't fucking do it anymore. I am afraid to act because I'm so tired of feeling like every action I take is going to make everyone hate me and I'll be alone and miserable for the rest of my life, but when I do nothing I get yelled at for being a pathetic sack of shit who can't get out of bed. I can't eat. I have trouble sleeping. I'm taking it out on my amazing boyfriend, and in turn he's getting frustrated with me because he can't seem to grasp that this is not a choice I'm making, and of course when he gets frustrated the monologue changes to ""do you really think he's going to keep putting up with your bullshit for much longer..."" etc. 

I can't win against my own mind. It knows exactly which insecurities to exploit from moment to moment. I can do nothing to please it. Sometimes I can turn down the volume, but I can never turn it completely off. And at this point I'm not even sure if it's schizo symptoms or just my incredibly broken sense of self-worth. All I know is I cannot keep going like this. It's killing me. 

I've made an appointment with a therapist, and hopefully that'll help, but I need a quick boost to get me through today. MMFB?

We have a ton in common, we're both decently well off, smart, funny...etc.  She tells me off the bat, ""I'm not going to sleep with you.""  Which is perfectly fine with me.  I was never one for meaningless encounters and was looking for someone to spend time with.  Well, things progress and one Friday night I spend the night at her place.  We fool around a little, but it's mostly just cuddling and pleasantry.  I stayed there Saturday night too.  That Tuesday, we go out for drinks and we're having a good time, hold hands on the walk back to her place... For not having any meaningful contact with a girl in 6 years, I'm on cloud 9.  We end up in her bed and we end up having sex.  A bunch of times.  Fall asleep in each other's arms.

Wake up the next day and we each leave for work...I don't hear anything from her all day so I try texting her at around 9pm.  No reply.  Tried again the next day around 4...nothing.  She's completely ignoring me and has effectively removed me from her life.  In a last ditched effort, I even texted, ""Are we still even friends?""  Nothing.

I thought I'd finally found someone that I can spend time with.  Someone I actually care for and enjoy being around.  Unfortunately, that doesn't seem to be the case...

* A job is required for my practicum. I have only 1 month to complete 300 hours and I haven't even started the application process yet. 
* I have really immature friends and they're actually nice but they just don't get me, or how to give me advice or cheer me up. 

*happy birthday, happy birthday...*

I feel like nobody's there for me, I'm really just watching American Pie right now hoping the blatant sexually oriented humor would cheer me up at least. I need a nice, warm, tight hug and I miss my girlfriend and my family. It feels as if all those problems are coming at me at the same time. I know I can cope with any of them if they were coming at me alone, but they're all coming at the same time and I might be overacting but its as if nothing is going my way.

I also told him I feel horrible about the way I've treated him, and lied by telling him my siblings felt the same way.

He was telling me to not bring this up ever again but I have this urge to tell him something when I see him in the morning.  What makes it worse is it's kind of a hard concept for me to get across.  Here it is: I know people that I recognize are illiterate and I know people that I recognize are dumb, some of these people are close friends and I can see it's linked to how they were raised.  I don't think him and I are literary afficianados or anything, but because he was neither of those, he helped to encourage me to read.

She had been in a terrible relationship with a sociopathic heroin addict for a couple of years. I had tried to talk to her about how horrible he was for her, but she was a very trusting person and loved him very much, so she stuck with him. Her logic, somehow, was that she didn't want him to be alone in his addiction.. so she let him shoot her up with heroin. She became a heroin addict and ended up moving something like a thousand miles away to be with him and live with his father. Things didn't work out there, and she ended up moving back about a week or so before Christmas of 2010. She got off of the drugs, broke up with him, got a job, got a place to live, and was doing generally better... we were all excited. 

And then he showed up at her work when she got off, one night.

He told her that he just wanted to apologize to her for everything. Said that he had gotten off of the heroin and felt bad about everything he had put her through. Jess was, like I said, a little too trusting... yeah, I'd go so far as to call her naive. She let him go home with her. That was the last night she was alive.

They found her the next morning. The autopsy said she had died from a heroin overdose. She had 17 external injuries and 3 or 4 internal injuries to go along with that. Her ex boyfriend stole all of her money, debit/credit cards, her IDs, and took the rings off of her fingers. He's not in jail. 

I don't know what to do right now. I know that I need to get over it, and that dwelling on it and crying over it isn't going to bring her back. 
Nothing can bring her back. But I'm still so incredibly angry. He's not in jail. I don't think he will ever be in jail, and he really needs to be. He killed my best friend. Typically people who overdose on heroin themselves do not end up with 17 external injuries and internal bleeding.

(I'm a woman.) I've teased her about how she can't knock it (sex with girls) 'til she tries it, but since we live together I never wanted to cross any lines that might make things uncomfortable.

I just got off the phone with her. She's in Utah visiting her family for the holidays, and apparently last night she slept with another girl and she is completely giddy. She actually said ""I think I'm in love,"" and that she was on her way to see this girl again right now.

I did everything I could to sound excited and happy for her, but as soon as I hung up I burst into tears. On the one hand, the door is open, but on the other...there is no way I can compete.

heres where problems arised: her mother and stepfather decided to not approve of me, and never let me over and did everything they could to have her break up with me and be with someone else. there were no reasons for their hatred, except that they took an exceptional effort to not like me and make me aware of it. eventually i was forbidden from coming over, her little brother and sister were told to stay awar from me. but that didnt stop her and I from loving each other. her real father loved me to death and loved how i took care of her and did everything in the world for her. she would spend time over my house with my family and friends, who took her in right away and made her a part of our life, our family.

I did everything in the world for her that i could, i would drive food to her in the rain in 40 minutes of traffic, bring her coffee, help her with schoolwork, supported everything that she wanted to do, and was always there for her, 200%. I loved her, and i never made her feel less important than anything else in the world. i even threw her a surprise 21 bday party at my house with all of her friends from school waiting at my house, something that shes always wanted. i loved her more than anything else, and i made sure she knew it whenever i could.

cut to three years later. a boy in her class ( i graduated from school the same year i met her) had been constantly attempting to get with her while we dated. he would call her at all hours of the night asking her to come over from my house and cuddle with him in bed, as he was lonley. see, he has dumped his current gf three times in a row, only to go right back with her when realizing that no other girl wanted to talk to him. hes also a major liar and mentally unstable, claiming to have attempted to kill himself as well as some bullshit story about him and his friend killing a drug dealer in an abandoned warehouse when they were in middle school, and never told anyone. he plays guitar, poet, and pretty much the pretentious hipster tortured artist stereotype that will come into your head. hes an asshole. well she started hanging out with him on a regular basis, and started staying over. her mother and stepfather got the four of them tickets to an expensive show and dinner, something i was never offered. she started spending the night over there as well.

cut to this past june, i told her how i felt about this gnuy and how much time she had been spending with him over me, and kind of throwing me to the side. after what would be our first fight, her mother made her break up with me. it was painful.

three days later she calls me to hang out, and we begin hanging out again, and eventually dating again, although she wants to keep it a secret from her mom and stepdad. things seemed really happy again.

cut to october, we begin saying i love you to each other again. but as it turns out, it really didnt mean much, since i found out the day after halloween that she was going over that boy's house behind my back and sleeping with him while with me. it went on for three weeks. 

when i approached her with what i had found out (a conversation i saw between her and her friend) she felt guilty, so much so that she didnt talk to me for three days. i told her i was willing to fogive her and we could work past this.

it turns out she didnt. two weeks ago, she started making posts on her facebook and tumblr about how much she loves her new boy, how much she cant wait to fix him, and all these things that should be about me, not someone who doesnt deserve her.she even made her recent school project about him and her, photos and all, even though she wont tell me i know exactly what it is.

christmas is almost here, and i cant help but feel hopeless. shes everything i wanted in a girl, and the only girl ive ever really loved. everywhere i go i am haunted by the ghost of her and I, and im just miserable knowing that i loved a girl so much, only for her to just walk away from everything. she doesnt talk to me anymore, lies to me constantly about what shes doing, and most recently someone i was very close to died, and she wasnt there for me at all. im 25 and my career is now just really starting to become a reality, but i feel hopeless, im not looking forward to christmas and i just miss her. i feel used. please reddit, help me to feel better. help me to know that im going to be ok. i dont have much of a heart left to share with anyone, because she took just about all of it and walked off.

The reason I'm typing all this out right now is because I think it might help me get out of this rut I'm stuck in. I'm posting under a throwaway account because I hope that I can get everything out and walk away and maybe feel better.

I'm currently a high school senior. It's December and I've barely started my college applications. It feels like I've been trying to make up for my mistakes for the past two years now. I used to be a straight A student and I'm used to success. When high school started, I'm not entirely sure what happened, but I must have fallen off the ball somewhere because instead of A's I got mostly B's and even got my first ever C. But I figured I could get over that and everything would be okay.

Unfortunately it turned out that sophomore year was the calm before the storm. Around October of 2010, I fell ill. I can't even remember what it was I was sick with, but I missed an entire week. And then my sporadic migraines started and I would end up missing around two days a week almost every week. I was constantly playing catch up and trying to keep up with everything. I ended up with one A, two B's, three C's, and an F in physics.

My physics teacher was an angel and agreed to let me make up work over the summer and then change my grade. However, I think something in me broke during my junior year. The thought of that F and those C's kept me from focusing on moving forward. Even today I keep thinking ""What's the point? I'm already a failure. What can I do that will change that?"" My parents are not helping this cause either. I love them all the same because they are my parents and that's what family does, but I'm tired of hearing comments about how I won't be able to get into a worthwhile college and that all their hopes and dreams for me have gone down the drain. I'm really tired of hearing them say that they feel like liars because they used to brag to everyone how bright I was and now they can't anymore.

Anyways, long story short, I ended up not actually getting much of my physics work done. I was supposed to hand it in in September and it's now December. I don't want to ask my teacher if she'll still accept it because she was already going above and beyond the call of duty.

I have friends, but I've never had a girl stay romantically interested in me for more than a few weeks, and physically I've never done anything more than kiss (I've made out once in my life). 

Anyways, I met an awesome, gorgeous, super-friendly girl who I have a class with, and we've been studying together and over the past few weeks I've been crushing on her pretty hard. Normally I wouldn't go for someone as attractive as she is, because I feel like she is ""out of my league"" but I misinterpreted her friendliness as flirting, so I thought I might have a chance. Yesterday I invited her out with a bunch of my friends, and she declined. But not until later in the night through a text, and she didn't give a reason. So now I'm fairly certain she isn't interested in me.

I feel the normal shittiness associated with rejection (I ended up getting blackout drunk last night) but I also feel guilty about the whole situation. Like I should apologize for thinking of her as potentially more than a friend. I don't know how to describe it exactly. Like by being attracted to her it's a breach of trust or something.

And of course, there's always the fear that the feedback loop of getting rejected -&gt; putting myself out there less will mean I'm never going to meet someone.

1312553958.0,20,self.MMFB,j9vg3,"I screwed up my chances at romance, possibly forever.",22,2,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/j9vg3/i_screwed_up_my_chances_at_romance_possibly/,"Not a throwaway and I don't care. I feel like I'm spiraling downward and need to talk to someone about it. I don't even care if anyone responds or not.

Here's the story: I'm terrible with women. I'm in my early/mid 20's and I'm a virgin. In high school I fell in love with a girl and tried to get her to notice me for years, but she flat-out rejected me. I didn't get the hint and still tried to get this girl to like me despite the obvious hopelessness of the situation. I must have seemed like a psychopathic serial killer to her; always staring at her and following her around in the hallway. She was right to send me to the high school guidance counselor's office, where I wept uncontrollably and had to promise to stay away from her, which I somehow managed to do. It took two years before I stopped thinking about her every day.

Because of that, I never really had any kind of dating experience in high school and I didn't learn how to talk to women. I tried in college a few times to talk to girls, but something would always get in the way; half the time it was my own insecurities, thinking they were far above my league. So I didn't do any dating in college, never went to any parties or events because I'm nauseated by the smell of alcohol and loud noises hurt my ears, among other reasons.

But I was perfectly all right with being alone. I convinced myself that it was something that wouldn't change, so I should get used to it. It was almost comforting knowing that there was this sort of stability in my life. I know that sounds perverse, but it's what I thought.

At any rate, right out of college I get a job at an office. There's another girl who works there; let's call her ""Lillian."" I meet this girl and she seems OK to me. A little high-strung perhaps, but reasonably pretty. Anyway, both of us are there for about seven months. I'm friendly towards her, but no moreso than I'd be to anyone else.

One day I'm down in a storage room processing some deliveries when Lillian comes in to pick up something. She sits down and we have a chat, same deal as usual. In the middle of our conversation there's a pause and she starts giggling a bit. I sit there like a deer in headlights, confused. She looks up at me and says: ""So, what are we going to do about this?"" I mentally scramble trying to figure it all out when soon it becomes apparent to me: she likes me. To be more accurate, she *likes* me.

Armed with this newfound knowledge, I try to play it cool as my heart beats at Mach 4. Soon we set up my first-ever date, to be held the following Monday. That Sunday was the longest day of my life. I knew that whenever anything this good happens to me, I find some way of screwing it up. But I went for it anyway.

Monday comes around and we leave the office together to go see a movie. It was January and cold as shit as we waited outside the theatre, but inside I was on fire. I was actually making attempts at flirting with this attractive, intelligent girl who showed even the slightest amount of interest in me. I gathered what little courage I had and acted on my best behavior.

The date went quite well. The movie we saw wasn't the best thing ever, but I wasn't there for the movie. I picked the perfect moment to hold her hand during the film; I sort of slid my pinky finger over hers' before trying to move in with the rest of my hand. I got scared for a second when she took her hand away, but it was only to remove a ring and then our hands were locked for the rest of the film. I was on top of the world in that theatre.

The film ends and the time comes for me to muster my courage to ask for a kiss. I try to surreptitiously apply chapstick while walking out of the theatre and I notice her applying some kind of lip gloss or something at the same time. A voice in my head says: ""Pinky, is she pondering what I'm pondering?"" My heart continued racing as we stood in the theatre lobby making small-talk. Finally I got myself psyched up enough to do it. The conversation went something like this:

""So Lillian, I've been meaning to ask you, and feel free to say no, but would it be all right if I-""

""Yes.""

""...kissed you?""

""Yes.""

After a little bit of positioning. I moved in for my first kiss ever. The first ""phase"" of the kiss was a bit off, I hadn't done it before and didn't really know how to position my lips. She asked me ""how did that feel?"" I couldn't think of anything witty to say, so I just said ""I don't know"" and she laughed a bit. Then I moved in for the second ""phase"" of the kiss, this time I was getting the hang of it, but I must have done something screwy because I think I felt her teeth at one point. Finally, at the third ""phase"" the magic happened. It was wet and juicy and loud and amazing. If I close my eyes I can still feel my lips pressed against hers'. I wish I could stop the world at that one moment, because everything in it was exactly right at that moment. For the first time in my life, I understood what real happiness felt like. The only thing I could think to say to her after that was a whispered ""wow.""

So the date ended and on the train ride home I'm elated beyond all description. I felt exhilarated and free and alive in a way I had never known before. She had told me at the end that we should do it again sometime, leading me to believe that this was not just some casual encounter for her. I should point out, however, that I cannot read signals at all and was totally unschooled in the ways of dating ettiquete. Remember this fact, as it will be important momentarily.

The next day at work I found it difficult to keep at my usual job with her sitting twelve feet away from me (obviously our co-workers didn't know about our date). My whole life seemed so much brighter at that moment and I couldn't have been happier. This, however, is where I ruined my chances with both her and probably anyone else forever. At the end of the day we were both on the elevator going down, alone. I turn to her and say:

""I don't know how I'm going to explain to my parents that I have a girlfriend now.""

You know how people often talk about what they would do if they had a time machine? This sentence. I'd go back in time and kick my past self in the balls before he could utter this sentence. This is possibly the worst decision I've made in my entire life; I honestly thought that was how it worked, that if you went out with someone and wanted to keep going out with them, that constituted a relationship. Needless to say, Lillian was taken quite aback at this and left the office weirded out. Idiot me took about two days to realize the magnitude of what I had done and I tried to apologize to her in letter form (where it would be more difficult to misspeak) but the damage had already been done.

The following week, we sit down together (in that same storage room where this all started) and talked about it. All things considered, Lillian was actually quite patient and gracious about the whole thing. Her feelings boiled down to what she told me at the end: ""I can't give you what you want."" I told her that all I wanted was someone who understood me and who I could understand, even a little bit, and that she had essentially already given me that. However, by now I could see that I wasn't going to get anywhere and we parted semi-amicably.

That date was six months and twelve days ago today. Since then I've made ten attempts to converse with women, mostly random strangers, but have had nothing in the way of success. I joined Reddit three months ago and made a few attempts to communicate with women over it, but the result is always the same: eventually they just stop talking to me and pretend like I don't exist. I think that's what hurts me the most, actually: at least if they insulted me I would know they put some effort into responding to me and acknowledged my existence.

Meanwhile, Lillian still works here and every day she looks more and more beautiful than the day before. She's twelve feet away and I can't reach her. Is it possible to miss someone who's right next to you? I doubt she even remembers our date; I'm probably just a minor footnote in her life at this point. I'm just some guy at work who didn't understand relationships. None of those other women I've tried to talk to gave me anything resembling attention; at best I could get brief, polite conversation.

Last night I made another attempt to talk with a woman on the train coming home. I started with small-talk about the lack of air conditioning, but before I could do anything else she got up from her seat to make a phone call, then sat down in a different seat as far away from me as possible. When she did this, something snapped inside me and I just started crying. I haven't cried in years but I couldn't stop myself.

That night I tried to go to sleep but I'd keep waking up crying and I couldn't stop myself. I just kept thinking about how I don't deserve any kind of romance or relationship in my life because I'd just find a way to destroy it like I did with Lillian (Lillian insists that I deserve someone, just not her). I pondered about how I'm alone again, but instead of being content this time I'm deathly afraid of being alone. For a brief instant I knew true happiness and then I destroyed it. Sometimes I'd have rather not known it at all, because now I know the state of pure joy that will forever elude me, now all I see on the streets are couples, and every time they hold hands or draw themselves nearer to each other I get sick to my stomach, knowing that I'll never be able to experience that beautiful emotional connection to another human being. I don't even really care about sex or anything like that, I just want someone who I can complain to and who can complain to me, someone to share joy and misery, someone who doesn't avert their gaze every time I walk into a room like I'm a mutant or something.

I have so much love I could give to someone and no one to give it to. I feel like I just want to stop existing. I don't want to kill myself; that wouldn't accomplish anything. I just don't want to keep going through the process of living, I don't want to keep experiencing rejection everywhere I turn, as if every woman I encountered was like a brick wall that I can't circumvent no matter how hard I try. I haven't been this miserable since high school and if I tell Lillian all this, she'll probably either ignore me or give me some pat advice and then go on with her life. Although it isn't as though I'd want to bother her with all this anyway; I've already dragged her through enough of my problems and I'd hate myself if I caused her any more distress.

So there it is. Someone make me feel better. Or don't. I don't care. I don't matter very much anyway.

I'm 20 years old and I found out in January that I was 6 weeks pregnant, and in that same moment I found out that my boyfriend and baby daddy didn't want anything to do with the child. I had told him several times throughout our relationship that if this situation ever occurred that I would NOT get an abortion. And after weeks of fighting with him over it, I finally told him that he either needs to step up or step out. He kept his mouth shut, but began to distance himself from me.

He would listen to me cry and vent and he even celebrated my birthday with me when my boyfriend decided that he didn't care enough to do anything for me. We hung out all the time, and would just spend a lot of time talking and texting about anything and everything. From work to video games to random stupid things in our lives. He would take interest in how appointments went, how I felt throughout pregnancy, and always reminded me to try and not stress out so much over things, because it was bad for both me and the baby.

It was a sad good bye, but we reminded each other that we would keep in touch thanks to technology, and it wouldn't be too long before he would try and make his way across the state to visit me for the day, and it wouldn't be long before I came back to the area to visit the baby daddy, since he was staying in the area.

And for a while I was doing well, wasn't thinking about him much, and even started talking to three nice guys on OkCupid, although I've only met one and we haven't seen much of each since. Anyway, admittedly this depression spell comes in the wake of learning that he ""restricted"" me on facebook, after I ""restricted"" him.

**Quick background info about everything:** We met in university last year. He would show interest in me in class (staring, complimenting my work, etc.) I'm really shy so I actually avoided him for a while out of nervousness but toward the end of the year I warmed up to him and was able to have short convos with him without stuttering. (I have social anxiety, and I'm not good with guys). Anyway, the class ended last April and I ran into him once that summer while working. Last October he randomly messaged me on facebook saying he missed me, we should hang out, text, etc. Overall he acted like he liked me. 

After we exchanged numbers he'd text me  nearly everyday, and I'd respond. He even tried to ask me out to dinner once. I own a small business so it was difficult to find time to visit him since he lives a few cities away from where I currently reside. *BUT* I made sure to mention 3 times that we could meet each other half way. He was never interested in having to travel any distance to see me though and would never answer that suggestion. Randomly he started ignoring my texts for days when he was the one who texted me first nearly all the time. 2-4 days later he'd text me back apologizing like mad, saying how terrible he was, and that he was busy with school/had fallen asleep/was depressed). ...

I found out through his twitter that he was actually talking to other girls many of those times.I have severe social anxiety, and I suppose, a fragile heart. I've never been in a relationship. The thought of a guy actually liking me and wanting to date me seemed surreal. I was naive enough to think I was wanted, that I deserved love. Instead I was made a fool of and badly hurt because of my ignorance. I hated myself, I cried often and blamed myself for the way he treated me. (I still do look back and nitpick at my behaviour, what I said. trying to figure out how I may have messed this up). I was a fucking mess. I didn't know how to move on from that. I still don't I guess. But I still tried. Literally the only thing I could think to do was erase his phone number (ignore any further texts) and restrict him on facebook. Just try to avoid him forever if possible. 

Recently those feelings of intense hurt, guilt, depression/anxiety have been coming back very strongly. It's because there's a high chance that I'll run into him next weekend. He’s gonna be attending a convention I’m going to next month as a vendor. I heard he plans to spend most of his time in the vendors area (where I’ll be stationed) and I can’t help wondering what will happen if/when I run into him. (He's approached me at conventions in the past, and I just don't know how to deal with seeing him again.) I mean, I’ll ignore him if I see him. But what if he approaches me? What will I say? How will I get out of it? Thinking about it makes me so nervous I get sick to my stomach. Plus it also rekindles all my hurt feelings and insecurities about why being he played me in the first place. : / 

**EDIT:** He texted me today saying: ""hey ____ :) long time no talk. I take it you’re going to the convention on the weekend?"" I haven’t responded to him yet. I don’t want to, but I fear not replying will make him think I’m angry/hurt. (I am but I don't want him to know). I just don’t want to deal with him anymore. I’m afraid if I reply he’ll say ‘oh, let’s chill.’

To be honest I think the only reason he’s contacting me is because I’ll more than likely be the only person he knows who's going to the con. He asked around if anyone wanted to go with him weeks ago, and didn't get many responses. Look at that, I’m a last resort yet again.

1362025896.0,17,self.MMFB,19dlqe,Stressed and really sad... Looking for fellow Redditors who will listen and won't judge... ,22,5,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/19dlqe/stressed_and_really_sad_looking_for_fellow/,"I just want to note, this is my first thread/post ever on Reddit. 

I just have a lot of things in my life that are stressing me out to the point where I'm just continuously sad. I try to do all the things and surround myself with the people that I know make me really happy, but nothing works. I've had more feelings of wanting to be alone more than I have ever had before and I can't seem to take myself away from listening to the sad songs. I hate being that kind of person that sulks around feeling sorry for myself. But that seems to be what I'm doing...and I hate it. 

My schoolwork is stressing me out beyond belief and I feel like there are never enough hours in a day to get all my work completed, but everyone goes through it. 

I feel like I can't make any of my friends happy because I can't clone myself into 20 people and be there when they want me to be there. My roommate continuously gets pissed when I'm not in the room for an extended period of time, and she sometimes acts like my mother asking where I was, what time I got back (if she goes to sleep before I get back), etc. I also get the lectures of ""You really shouldn't be doing this because..."". She openly admits to being an introvert, which is perfectly fine. She loves to be on her MacBook. I'm just a little more extroverted and choose to not stay put for many hours at a time. But everytime I go somewhere, I feel bad knowing she's upset that I'm not there. She had a bad experience with her last roommate not being around much. Its not only her, but a lot of my other friends want me in lots of other places. They just get mad when I can't be everywhere, making me feel like a complete failure and that I'm good for nothing except hurting people. 

My relationship is slowly falling apart... in my eyes. I've dated my boyfriend for almost three years now. He's 20 and I'm 18. We go to two different colleges. The long distance isn't the problem, oddly enough. I've just reached a breaking point. I'm continuously the scapegoat with him as well as his mother, who he's more dependent on than he should be at 20 years old. My dad also seems to be a scapegoat for them too. I can't stand being blamed for things when he doesn't wish to take any responsibility for anything. He also can't seem to make simplistic decisions on his own without someone making them for him. I know there's someone out there who can mother him, but it can't be me. 

But I'm afraid... Because our relationship has been 3 years in length, its just become normality, and the thought of losing that normality kind of scares me. But I know its time to move on and say goodbye...

Another reason for this is because I've met someone here... 
Someone I care for a whole lot... And he's told me he feels the same.
But he also has a girlfriend... and his relationship, as far as I know, is happy. We have become close friends, but ever since we admitted to having feelings for one another, we've kept our relationships out of our conversations. We're both honest people and we haven't done anything physically, but our feelings have become more in depth. 

He and his girlfriend meet up on the weekends She's 16 and still in high school; both of them from the local area. The day they hang out, I have a dark cloud hanging over my head because I consistently think about it. Its not jealousy. Its longing. Wishing I was her... 
Despite the fact I wish it was me, I hate being selfish. I've met his girlfriend, and she is really a sweet and genuine girl, and she is really pretty. Seeing how happy she is with him, I would hate to see her get hurt... And I would feel absolutely horrible if I ended up being the reason why, despite the fact I barely know her. 

I know it sounds odd to say that last statement in a way, because I know other girls who have easily said, if they win the guy's heart, they won't feel sorry at all whatsoever. I'm not catty, and I don't believe in having no emotion or sympathy for the other party. I seriously would feel bad if I was the reason she'd have her heart broken. But seeing them together... it really hurts... The thought of the fact I can't be the one that makes him happy... breaks me. Really rips me to shreds. 

I'm very particular in who I confide in, and who gets my trust. I just feel like my friends right now would just judge me negatively for how I'm feeling, on top of that, I just feel like they wouldn't understand. I would confide in the close guy friend I've come to basically fall in love with, but that's the worst thing to do when it involves him and his girlfriend, so I don't even consider talking to him about it.

Long time lurker here with a new account, this is my first post and maybe it should go in /r/Parenting but that seems to be dedicated to new parents with young children only.  I guess I'm posting it here in /MMFB because, well, this really fucking sucks.  I feel torn up inside at what to do...i want to do the right thing but i'm torn and feel myself just struggling to not feel incredibly depressed about this whole thing.  

This may be a ramble, i'll tl;dr at the end.  This entire post probably belongs in a ""first world parenting problems"" more than anywhere else, but I've been at this crossroads for a few months now and just need some outside ideas, thoughts, or even just a couple words of encouragement that we'll make it through this without my family being torn apart.

Quick background on me: I'm the husband in a very happily married for a couple of decades now and my daughter is and always has been the apple my my eye.  My wife and I also have a son, he's a little different than me, but my daughter and I are cut from the same cloth...first born, daddy's girl and all that.  She was a great baby and overall we made it through all the typical ""difficult"" years (terrible twos, terrible tweens) without, from my perspective, it being too difficult at all.  My wife stayed home for about 13 years with our daughter and son (who is younger).  I struggled with depression since my younger teenage years and finally accepted help in my mid-30's.  I am currently, by choice and guidance from my doctor, unmedicated.  The mental tools i've developed over the past few years work to keep me floating peacefully...and I can move through all the worry, self-doubt and self-deprecation in a way I never thought possible 10 years ago.  I still have quite temper at times, but I've also really worked on that aspect of myself.

Quick background on her: She's a smart girl...driven beyond belief...loyal to a fault...she may even really have a type-a personality with a great sense of humor.  She has struggled, since she was a younger teen, with depression and anxiety which she has been treated for (through medication and therapy) and is currently medicated.  This shadow, unfortunately runs in the family on my side.  She goes to a local private school, but lives at home because she also rides horses which we keep at our house.  We currently pay for her car (it's the 3rd one for her...she's totaled the prior 2) so she has some modicum of freedom and because of her schedule (riding, school and work), having only 2 cars is not an intelligent option.  She works part time and uses her money for various things but primarily on gas and to help us offset the cost of keeping the horses (feed, vet, farrier) and goes to school full-time.  She also has some decent privacy at home.  She's got a full schedule and has goals in school and for riding her horses to prepare for show season.  She is the opposite of lazy...she words hard.  I'm proud of her and her dedication and her work ethic.  

But...it's like pulling teeth to ask her to help us with something.  Her and I can only carry on the most casual of conversations because many times when i ask her for help things either don't get done or they get done in a half-assed manner then gets angry at me for pointing out how half-assed they are.  So, in that, she's probably a typical teenager I guess?

Last year, after talking with my wife and finally understanding how important it was to her that I become a bit more flexible, I began to really pull back on my expectations of what I could expect from our daughter.  I have no idea what it's like to parent an 18 year old or how best to do it.  My experience as a young man was, well, not what I want to repeat.  So reigning in my expectations were intentional and, you know what, it was very insightful to feel like maybe I was the cause of some of the animosity.  So, I pulled back and tried not to be such an asshat about things.  I worked on lowering my smartass attitude and having a longer fuse.  My wife knows I did and I'm proud of how I was able to step back from feeling so frustrated.  From, at times, not really even liking her and her narcissism..  It helped lower the bar of tension I think.  Things I'd get pissed at kinda flew by without a bat of my eyelash and, overall, things went better.  They went better because I had to work hard to be better.  But you know, for all that soul searching my experience last night illustrates the reason I'm here, feeling like i'm close to the end of my rope with her.  

I go to school myself, and have an series of exams I need to do for work.  Therefore, my nights have to be scheduled pretty religiously.  Given this information I approached our daughter calmly seeking her help for one night a week to get my son to where he needs to go.  I remained calm in the face of her obvious frustration at my request.  This was another scenario where 2 years ago we would have ended up yelling at each other, but I calmly illustrated what i needed, at which, she had a nice healthy yell at me that she would do it on Wednesdays for me.

My wife, fortunately, heard the entire thing.  Heard my calmness...my intentional calmness and my simple request.  It's at times like last night, and this has happened a few times since I dedicated myself to being more patient where I really feel like my daughter is a genuine bitch.  I've been stewing on her reaction since last night and can't come to another conclusion other than she doesn't feel any need to help us out without a fight.  We don't hold the things we do for her or the things she has over her head as threats because that would drive her away.  We do these things because we love her...we love her a lot.  I'm lucky to have such a great family...but Reddit, i'm tired of the fight for help. 

It has driven me to the point of asking her to move out.

But I worry.  As a father I worry she won't finish school.  As a father I don't know how she can support herself?  Can she move into the dorms and then just pay the price of having that debt over her head?  I worry I am overreacting to what is typical behaviour for an 18 year old...that I should just learn to deal with it.  We all make the bed we have to sleep in and so I have no doubts that she's a result of her upbringing, but at some point a person makes a decision to be a nice or a mean person.  That she would hold a grudge against us and cut us out of her life is what my wife and I fear.

She has a scholarship which pays for about half of her school and the rest is on loans.  My wife and I have a life to lead and I wonder when it's time to push her from the nest.

Maybe i'm not looking for answers, but just needed to vent.  Thanks Reddit.

tl;dr - want the best for our responsible 18 year old who lives at home, but getting tired of the attitude and of feeling like i'm the bad guy.

I'm 28, I've never had a girlfriend, I'm the absolute opposite of the archetypal attractive guy and thus get no attention or respect (I literally *hate* all attractive people and thinking about their wonderful lives makes me sick), I have social anxiety, I have generalized anxiety, I can't call or go to a doctor, the acne won't stop even this late into the game, I drink alone to numb the pain (I'm drunk right now), I can't make or keep friends, even if I had potential friends I wouldn't know because my heart is black and empty and I feel nothing for no one, I spend every weekend in my apartment alone (aside from my cat and beer), I can't talk to people or my parents or anyone who might be able to help, I sit around and play video games not because I want to but because that's the only thing I can do, I have no hobbies or talents beyond being okay at video games (online shooters mostly) and guitar, and, if this is all there is for me, I don't want to be here anymore.

I am living with the love of my life. I love him for who he is, and I accept his flaws, all except the fact he is not ready for commitment.

We've been together for five years. We are both young, in our mid-20's.

I left my life behind in my home country to travel across the ocean to be with him. He got a job in a faraway country from me, but it was closer to his home country. It was so difficult, but I started to settle in.

We had our problems all couples have after moving in together, but things improved so much. I was happy having him in my life every day in person rather than through a screen, and I thought he was too. But suddenly he wants to break up.

He says he loves me and there are so many things he likes about living with me, but he cannot shake the feeling he is being restricted. He has always had trouble knowing what he wants. He never tried to talk to me about having this feeling. It totally blindsided me.

The moment I told him how I felt about everything, he became unsure of his decision said he didn't want to break up anymore. We tried to go over some things that could help him feel ""less trapped,"" but to be honest there is not really anything I can do. He already has a lot of freedom, and I can keep giving and being accommodating, but it will not help him decide any faster what he wants in life.

I told him we can't go on like this and he was right, and sadly I will move back to my home country. I am so in love with him and I am scared I will never see him again, but I cannot spend my life with him when he is so hesitant about giving himself to me.

I told him I love him, and that I want to marry him, but I know he isn't ready or maybe just doesn't want it. I told him I can't stay because my very presence is a pressure to him, so I need to go. I said to him, if you ever decide you want to marry me too, come find me.

I cannot put my life on hold for him anymore and wait on him to slowly decide. I need to live my life with or without him. I already knew I wanted to be with him. If he can't decide that, what kind of life is that for me?

I spent so much effort to make a way to be with him. Leaving behind something and someone so important to me - even though I know I must - is the hardest thing I have ever done. Ugh...

MMFB.,22,2,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/11g1nk/watched_my_boyfriend_have_a_nervous_breakdown_a/,"A bit of background: My boyfriend and I met 5 years ago in college. We didn't start dating right then because he was in a serious relationship with another girl. Two and a half years ago, she left him out of the blue, after 5 years of living with him. I helped him pick up the pieces, and we started dating shortly afterwards.

My boyfriend is 30-something and recently moved back in with his parents, because his sister-in-law didn't want him living with her and his brother (who got married earlier this year after a whirlwind courtship), and because he couldn't find an apartment to move into. He's been there a month so far, and is (obviously) really depressed.

Today, after coming home from eating breakfast out, my boyfriend felt ill and passed out for several hours. When he woke up, I saw a side of him I rarely see, and when I see it, it scares the shit out of me.

He started babbling about ""being more open"" and needing to ""speak up"". He felt immense resentment that he's not as ""successful"" as his peers. He also told me that if it wasn't for me, he would have killed himself two and a half years ago after his last girlfriend left. I knew of this suicide attempt (he was close to jumping from the balcony of his high-rise apartment) and I still get upset anytime there are references to 'jumpers' anywhere.

He was also stumbling around his room, and kept asking me why I was so scared and crying. As someone who also suffers from mental illness, it's really hard to stay strong when someone you love is so tormented and anguished. Eventually, I gave him some Ativan/lorazepam, and he kind of reverted back to someone closer to himself.

Needless to say, I am extremely worried about him. I wish we could live together, so he can get out of his parents' house, but I'm about to leave my part-time job at the end of the month and am going to school full-time with student loans. Even if I kept my part-time job, I don't work nearly enough hours nor make enough money to even pay for my phone bill half the time.

After what happened today, I know how much I can love someone unconditionally. And I know I would do ANYTHING to make my boyfriend feel better. I just wish I could handle my emotions better.

Before I begin, this is a throwaway, so I don't upset the other people involved.

We/I lost a good friend today. A person I've known for many years. The kind of guy that's always smiling, always ready to help. Crazyest ideas first. 

We were having a good night yesterday. Just hanging out in our own little clubhouse, laughing, messing around, the same thing we do every week. Making plans for the weeks to come... Something we do every saturday. Most of us left a bit early, but his 3 best friends stuck around. They got into a little argument, they asked him to come to a big party, where the rest of us were, he didn't want to, and being a little drunk, he escalated things a little. So the 3 others left for the party, stopped half way, turned back to try and get him to come anyway. He was still angry for no appearant reason, so they left him there to cool down. 

An hour or so later, they get a call, it's the guy asking how to turn off the lights. Everything seems normal. A bit later, his 3 best friends get a text, saying ""I hope you regret this, for the rest of your life"". Being at a party, and never being confronted by a suicide before, they didn't think to much of it, neither did we.

The morning after, his brother wakes up to notice the guy's not at home. So he calls the best friends, they don't know where he is. The brother goes out, the guy has the tendency to just crash somewhere in our bar, to go pick him up. He walks around our bar, to find his own brother, hanging in the middle of our forest.

This afternoon we got a call. Everyone involved in our organisation had to come down, there was important news. The moment I got there, and saw my friends' faces, I knew something was wrong. Maybe an accident or something.

I step out of the car, and they tell me what happened. It was just... such a mindfuck... We all sat there. For hours. A psychologist came by, but none of us are really ""into"" that kind of thing. But we/I need someone to talk to. So here I am.

I'm not sure what to feel right now. On one hand, I feel sad. It's so surreal to know I'm never going to see him again. On the other hand I'm mad. Why did he do this to us? Why did he do this to himself? Nobody saw this coming. He was happy, for as far as we knew. So many questions that will remain unanswered. 

But most of all, I just feel empty. It's only been a couple of hours, but I have the feeling I'm allready moving on, combined with guilt that I'm allready trying to get passed this...

A little over a year ago I was hospitalized for about a week. I had apparently accidentally overdosed on prescription medication (I remember taking 1 or 2 pills of my medication and next thing I know I am in a hospital). That is a whole different story in and of itself, but a few weeks after I was discharged a received several different bills from several different medical organizations, due to all the tests that were done on me. The biggest one was more than $99,000. 

I got a few calls from the hospital, leaving me messages to call them back. I never took any of their calls; I was too paralyzed with anxiety to respond. After a couple of months or so, they transferred the balance to a collections agency. Again, I neglected their calls. Nowadays, I get about a call from them a week. In the message they say that they have a ""limited time settlement offer."" I KNOW I should call them back, but I can't bring myself to do it. I get incredibly anxious just thinking about it. I had to force myself just to write this.

I have thought of bankruptcy, but I have about $4,000 in credit card debt that has slowly mounted as any sort of financial aid (I am in college) has stopped now that I am entering my 6th or 7th year as an undergraduate. I know nothing of repossession and what would happen to everything I bought , especially considering I have sold as much of it as I could (books, movies, games) just to make minimum payments on my cards. Furthermore, the collections agency has placed a mark on my credit and is now a very poor score.  I have no idea if bankruptcy is even the right thing to do in this situation.

I have no job; though I have ramped up my job search in recent weeks (have been applying to places like Best Buy, UPS, FedEx, grocery stores, pizza places, etc). I expect to graduate at around this time next year. But this whole situation is constantly looming over my head. This summer isn't helping; now that I am out of school, I have so much free time I do nothing else but think.

Please help me reddit...

It's all my fault too.",21,1,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/vo9nw/kissing_a_girl_first_time_parents_outrage_its_all/,"Please read this, I really need some advice. (It's not about a girl, more about about parents)..

Alright, so let me tell you guys a little about myself. I'm 18, male, and I've been on and off with this one chick, I've never dated her, and I liked her, oh and I've also never had a girlfriend or hooked up with a girl before. Basically, today me and her hung out (since almost a year ago), and my intention was to hook up with her.. which I did, I held her hand, I hugged her a lot.. And here's where the bad part begins.. You see.. my parents, always tease me and shit, and always ask questions when I'm seeing girls. And to prevent that, and make it simple, I found a quick solution.. I told my parents ""Hey, I'm going to my friends house (a dude) to program"". And they agreed.

However.. As I was driving her home, my parents have work close by.. Guess what happens? First they call me, and say ""hey, I see your car, why are you driving here?"" I said I was showing my ""friend"" around my other house.. And they are like ok, wave to us as we pass by. And I'm like for sure.. This is where it all goes wrong.. They notice that I'm riding with a chick.. and my mom calls and starts bashing her, saying she's a prostitute and she's too skinny and a crack addict (which is totally not the case).. But then I tell my mom I'll talk to her later.. Which I did.. But before so, I dropped her off at her house, and I told her I've been meaning to do something for a while, and here it goes, and I made out with her.. Feeling great, I head home, my mom calls again. She starts crying, whining and going insane. This is just some of the stuff I said.. Keep in mind, my mom always confuses me with her brother (my uncle) who lives in Poland. There was a time when he was around my age and he dated a prostitute, and she lied to him, and now my mom just wont get that out of her head.

Basically she went like this:
""She does all sorts of drugs, she hangs out with drug dealers, she will lie to you and say she got pregnant from you and file a lawsuit, she will mooch you out of all your money *sob sob sob*, she will mess up your mind and you will instantly fail at life and you will be destroyed, she has no goals in life (yes she does, she's going to college).. She is a whore bla bla bla, youre just like your uncle, same exact mindset""..

Alright, I responded the best I could and let me tell you, this is the first time my mom was so insane about me being around a girl.. I tried my best to respond with a good response. But honestly.. what could I do to fix the situation.. my mom and dad are both mad at me for lying (which I understand), but honestly, I couldn't tell them straight up that I'm going to hang out with a chick, everyday.. would be like ""how was it with her?"" ""how is she?"" ""what is she doing?"" ""bla bla bla"", and my dad... well my dad would tease me about it constantly, and they'd whine about how they ""pre-selected"" women for me that would fit me great... REALLY? It's not the 1660's. And I don't talk to them, and I honestly don't feel like it...

To add, my parents are Polish, so am I.. but still, all you people with normal parents be happy that you have normal parents..

But the trouble doesn't end here... My car (1987 camaro IROC-Z) was running fine all day when I was with the girl.. Started up fine every time.. Guess what? Parked it outside my house.. Next thing you know, I was going to pick my parents up from work (they work late shifts), and it wouldn't start... REALLY? I doubt karma, or any of that spiritual crap exists, but things like this really make me wonder..

Now that I am stable and have a home I brought him here to live out his golden years (he is about 18).  He's survived being the runt of a litter with pneumonia, being hit by three cars, several life threatening conditions, and awful neglect.  He nearly died when I came home and found him shivering in my parent's garage, weighing less than 3 lbs when he is supposed to be 8 lbs.  But unfortunately my furry angel is 90+ kitty years and I'm in my late 20's.  I feel like I'm going to spend the rest of my life missing him for those times he was there when everyone else that should have protected and loved me left or died.

Please knock some sense into me/MMFB.,19,0,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/pdq08/apathy_my_chance_at_a_love_life_please_knock_some/,"I know there are people in far worse situations, and I feel slightly ashamed at ""complaining"" (I have a job and wonderful parents who are supporting me through school), but it's a genuine concern of mine and I feel that people's input could be of some help. I'll provide as much information and answer as many questions as I can. I'm a 27 year old heterosexual male from Canada.

My apathetic world-view is killing my chances at a normal life/relationship. All my life I have never really committed to anything - quitting any club or activity if I even bothered to join it in the first place. I am generally dispassionate and dispirited about everything - although the rare times I show interest in something I can be very passionate about it. If I were to guess, self-diagnosis tells me that I may have a deep-seated fear of failure, which is why I never apply myself. I skimmed through high school and college with little-to-no effort on my part - I knew I could technically perform better but just feel completely unable to give a shit. It's like my brain doesn't connect the effort now with the reward down the road. I'm in University now and am struggling with simple things like picking my courses. I have little interest in anything it seems, and like I said I don't connect the dots to the prosperous rewards down the road. Someone tell me I'm a stupid, over-priviliged yuppie. So, big deal, you might say. Almost every student/person my age is uncertain about their future. Well, I can deal with carving out my academic/professional life. The biggest problem with my apathy is its affect on my love life (or lack thereof).

I'm fairly reclusive now. I live in a house with other room mates, but I rarely leave my room any more. I just can't get interested in the bar scene/outdoors/any activity at all. All I do is hang out in my room, smoke weed, and play video games (although recently I don't even want to play video games).  Although I don't think I'm hard to get along with, I just can't fathom beginning a relationship with anyone. Even if I did meet someone, what would I say?

I don't actually want to spend the time with anyone, I just desire a relationship. This was never really an issue before, I've always simply lived my life doing what I want and completely disregarding anything I wasn't interested in. It never occurred to me before to actively seek out a partner, I've always naively figured that I would eventually just find my soul mate.

This has only become an issue for me recently. I know I'm still young, but I can't help but look to the near future now. In 3 years I'll be 30, the age at which most people get married and have children. I know I shouldn't gauge myself against other's expectations/norms, but not only do I not have a girlfriend at the moment, it's been almost ten years since I was in any sort of relationship - and none of those were serious relationships, I'm lucid enough to realize that I've never been in love.

As stated, I don't think that I'm hard to get along with/bad looking. I'd assume it's just that my apathetic attitude towards everything is a complete turn-off/signal that I'm not interested. I remember a discussion with a female co-worker who described me as 'rigid' when we were discussing giving out hugs (or something like that). She just never saw me as the 'huggable' guy (not sure why I remembered this or thought it was relevant, I never had feelings for her). The frustrating thing about it is I have an unlimited capacity for passion, it's just that my apathy knows no bounds. Even if I see a girl I find attractive, my mind immediately goes into dismissive mode: ""What the hell would you do together?""

I know it's hard to follow my ramblings, I will answer any questions anyone has to the best of my ability, I just hope that someone has some insight/input/similar feelings that can help.

So knock some sense into me, tell me I'm being stupid, point out the glaring idiocy in my pitiful mental prison I've constructed for myself.

I just want to give up. I don't want to deal with this anymore. I should just let them lock me up. At least I'll have a bed, my meds, and no one will bother me.

I'm 15. And I know it'll get better later on and I know that I'm supposed to be enjoying my life right now. It's fuckin' hard to nowadays. So I don't go on and on for ages about how it all happened, here's a short list (in chronological order, more or less):

- I ""fell in love"" with a girl in ninth grade, tried to ask her out multiple times, didn't work out, heartbroken
- Moved from freshman to sophomore. Grades dropped from As to my first F
- Around here is probably where the suicidal ideation begins. Slightly at first, all the time now
- Girl I ""fell in love"" with started (and still is in) a relationship with one of my best friends (Guy I've known since second grade)
- New semester starts. Barely any homework being done due to depression induced laziness
- Today, I got rejected for the third time by one of my closest female friends
- That female friend is moving at the end of this school year
- Loss of life, loss of hope, loss of optimism, loss of sleep, loss of pleasure in my hobbies, loss of self pride, loss of dignity, loss of care for the future, loss of care for myself physically

Ffffffffffuck me. I'm so lost right now. I don't have anywhere else to turn besides my first psychiatrist appointment. Which is like a month away. *sigh* All I can do now is trudge along through life. Existing.

Deep down inside, I still care for my friends and family, which is why I'm still here and why you're reading this. It just makes me feel like shit knowing that all these people care for me and I'm thinking about offing myself. It's a cycle. Hating myself because I hate myself.

I shied away from him when family was in the room, I was always quiet when he was near. In middle school I began to realize that what he had done to me was not normal like he had said. That everything I had let him do to me was absolutely wrong and disturbing. He used to tell me that no one would ever love me unless I let him show me how to please men, because it was all I was good for. He told me that no one would marry me because I was so ugly. I used to believe every word he said and it has taken me a long time to realize that he is wrong. When I was 6 he stabbed me for crying loud enough to wake his wife, but she already knew what he was doing and didn't care. The wound wasn't big enough for me to have to go to the hospital, but I still have the scar. He abused almost all the women in the family including my mother, who blocked it out until it was much too late. When she did remember, she confronted him and asked if he had done this to any of her daughters, he said no hadn't. She has asked me many times if I was ever touched by him, but I have always said no because I think it would absolutely crush my mother to hear what had happened to me. The only proof I have to any of this is my nightmares, which happen all the time and my scar. My extended family refuses to talk to my mother, father, sisters or myself after the confrontation between my mother and grandfather. They told us it was our own faults, that he is a changed man and would never hurt anyone now. I was told by my aunt to forgive him like god would want or I would never see my cousin again and she would renounce me as a family member, no middle school student should be told that by anyone. I have never had counseling for anything that has happened to me because I do not have the money and it would raise questions with my parents that I do not want to answer. My grandfather has never been arrested for any of this and the last I ever heard of him was when he was working at a boys and girls club, which my mother called immediately and he was not allowed there again.

I found out I was (unexpectedly) pregnant last December. Had a very touchy, high risk pregnancy which culminated in me being induced, undergoing a c-section and losing 2.5 liters of blood in August. Luckily baby was healthy.

Unpaid 6-week maternity leave decimated our finances.

Developed postpartum depression and considered suicide. 

In November totaled car in accident trying to avoid hitting a bear cub. 

Today my four-year old son who has autism broke his collarbone. We took an ambulance ride to the hospital to the tune of $600. 

ETA: the $ part is minor compared to him not being able to understand why he is in so much pain and why I can't fix it. For instance it's 2:30 a.m. and he is saying ""mama this is my body, make me feel better"". I think this has been the hardest part of the year - seeing someone I love so frigging much in so much pain and not being able to do a damn thing about it.

I was also informed today that my husband's ex-wife will be returning the two older kids on Christmas Eve rather than Christmas Day at noon. Apparently I can pull two stockings out of my ass with 5 days notice. 

The oil tank is currently on empty and my husband is going to buy $30 worth of diesel. 

Reddit has been incredible with helping me with gifts for my kids this Christmas and I don't want to negate that at ALL. I am just wondering when the hell my bad luck will end. I feel like there is nothing I can do to enact positive change.

Each one of my teachers are borderline incompetent, two lovably so, one just an asshole, and the others are just bad teachers. I'm getting no sense of accomplishment from being here - just sitting in class, usually playing a game or reading on my phone - while people do presentations week after week after week with little actual instruction from the professor. There's really no reason to go to class, as our classes are so big that the teacher can essentially only lecture from the book, rather than foster any meaningful discussion.

Also, my Japanese classes are borderline pathetic. I've not learned a single thing in the past 3 months - just cramming the morning before a quiz tends to be enough. The book itself has no context, and the teachers just teach at us, using the term ""Intensive Japanese"" to just mean that we go really fast with no chances to actually use the vocabulary/grammar that was in the book.

And I just don't get Japanese people. 3 months here and I haven't made one Japanese friend, which was one of the points of coming here: to speak Japanese! If I do meet anyone, we just talk during that one time and then I never see them again. Also, my host grandfather is borderline demeaning - he treats me like a child, going so far as to tell me multiple times how to use the electric kettle, the toaster, or how to wash my hands. His house smells like cat pee because he decides to line his cat's litterbox with only newspaper, rather than kitty litter.

I should be super happy about being able to get out of the US and have experiences abroad, but all I am is angry at things: the school for wasting my time, the people for being so difficult to interact with, inanimate objects or situations (such as houses for not having insulation, so they're cold as shit all the time, or for things being just different enough from their counterparts in the states that it throws me off a little), and myself for thinking this way despite knowing that I shouldn't as it's a great experience for me. I mean, the only fun things that I've been doing have been playing Skyrim, and going to izakaya and getting shitfaced with my gaijin (non-Japanese) friends. I've wanted to cut my program down to a semester, so I can just go home and still get my study abroad requirement out of the way, but as the Japanese semester ends after my school's new semester starts, I'd have to go back home for 8 months (where I have few friends, and am not sure that anyone would be looking to hire for someone who won't be working long-term) and then take another semester after I should have graduated which may/may not be covered by my scholarships.

The only upside is that I've met someone who I really like, and likes me back, but there's a downside too: I'm too scared to do anything with as I've never actually been in a relationship before.

  * In January I hit ice, totaled my truck and thought I killed my best friend. After the accident, that was the scariest minute of my life, seeing him unconscious slumped over me, blood all through the cab. He made a quick recovery and jokes about it now, but I still feel bad.

  * In February, my Dad was in a head on collision and totaled his truck as well. Even though I was in college and didn't need a vehicle, it was still hard for a family of 3 with 4 jobs to get around with one vehicle.
    
  * In March, my Dad and I both got new vehicles, but mine needed $1000 in work done and we struggled paying all the new bills since I'm in college, had just a minimum wage job, and my family was paying for my schooling. Then, it seemed I met the girl of my dreams (guess how this ends). We clicked immediately and the more time I spent with her, the closer I got. We both respected the sort of mutual agreement that it wouldn't last or we couldn't get too serious. Every time we were intimate, I never pushed her for anything, something I kind of pride myself on.

  * In April, DreamGirl and I had an argument about our theoretical future and she decided it would be best to just be friends. My thought process: ""Ok...wait...no! Fuck!"" Then, for months, just empty lonely feelings. On top of this, I almost failed 2 classes.

  * In May, I layed my dirtbike over and got a nice, cozy, 3rd degree burn over much of my right leg and was gimpy for a couple months.

  * In June, my body hated me more after I went white water rafting, got thrown out in a class IV, and punctured my side on something submerged. At least I have nice battlescars now.

  * In July, my Dad had a few old friends over at a party at our home. His best female friend got drunk and jokingly sat on his lap. Mom caught this and was naturally upset. The ensuing trust, happiness, financial, etc. arguments ensue and I felt I had to mediate them. Now, in no way had I ever expected this. 25 years my parents had been married with hardly any smears on their relationship. Then, late in the month, I got the call. Dad was leaving Mom. I immediately called him and just...broke down. I've never cried so hard if at all. I lost all respect for him and all my sympathy went to Mom. I also got 3 points on my license for rolling through a stop sign.

  * August, the divorce goes through. Mom has had depression since I was born, so I worry. And worry....and worry. About what, I don't know.

  * September, college is back! Yay! I &lt;3 college! Or so I thought...my hometown is close to my college, where I live, and every weekend my HS friends came up and wanted to party and drink. Fun at first until they start becoming drunken assholes and I increasingly have less fun and worry about them.

  * October, I can't say no to going out with them, but I don't want to drink. The one day I do drink more than a few beers, my 21 y.o. sober friend drove me back to my house so I can get my wallet I forgot. On the way there, a cop pulls us over, sees that I've been drinking and writes me up for underage drinking. I want to be a teacher. I NEED to get this off my record, but it's now December and I've heard nothing. A week later, my boss calls me to say he's letting me go because of insurance purposes, what with the accident and 3 points on the license. (I was a delivery driver). Well, fuck...

  * November. I'm down. I think I may have depression, I had to drop a class due to low grades, and the effects of the Sophomore slump hit hard.

  * December (so far), my laptop screen fries.

  Now I'm left with a sense of what else can go wrong. The 3 times I've gotten laid can all be attributed to alcohol and I have no potential for any serious relationship, which is the one thing that could make me happy. I'm lost. I have, however matured a lot. I don't do any drugs, either. Advise, tips? Anybody been through similar years and came out stronger?

  TL;DR, My year's been shitty. Now I find myself just sort of waiting for the next bad thing to happen. Help please?

We arranged to have our belongings picked up on November 12th and shipped on November 15th. When they showed up to pick up our belongings it was a different company called Troy Moving. We asked why they were there and the driver told us they were hired to bring our belongings to A-2-Z's warehouse because they don't have small trucks. We thought nothing of it. It turned out Troy was subcontracted by A-2-Z to move our stuff to Kelowna. 

During the process of them loading the approached my husband and told him that there will be a charge because they have to carry our stuff down stairs. We told them no, we had told them there were stairs and it wasn't stated in the quote so we aren't paying. The driver also told us we are being charged for the mattress and furniture wraps. We again told him that it is something we aren't paying for, this time because it was stated as included in the quote. He made note of these on the paperwork and at the end of loading asked my husband to sign. Since he had made notes of what we didn't agree to pay my husband signed the paperwork. 

We left on November 15th to get to Kelowna. On November 20th I emailed the moving company asking if they had an ETA of when we could expect our belongings to arrive and got no response. On November 21st we arrived in to our new rental apartment. On November 22nd I called the moving company first thing in the morning to find out an ETA. They said they didn't know and would call me back. I waited all day with no return phone call so I called them about 40 min before they closed. I was put on hold for 20 min and forgotten about. I hung up and called back and was told they still had no idea where the truck was and when it wold be arriving. The only information she could give me was that I would get a call 24 hrs before delivery. 

After spending a couple nights in our new apartment we had secured before we moved (I had a friend check it out for me) we realized we could stay there. It was not soundproofed from the upstairs suite and continuously interrupted our daughters sleep. We found a new place quickly and let the landlords know we would be moving at the end of December. 

It worked out that my Aunt and Uncle were leaving on November 29th and would be gone until after new years. They let us know we could house sit for them and have our belongings delivered there instead since it was much closer to our new apartment than the apartment we were currently renting. It also meant we would have a bed to sleep in and pots and pans to cook with. We were at the time sleeping on an air mattress and had camping cookware. I emailed the moving company on November 26th to let them know we had a new address for the delivery. They never responded. I called them on November 28th to see if they had gotten my message and they said no, but then changed their story to they had. I asked again for an ETA and they again knew nothing. November 29th they finally told us our belongings were in Vancouver (for those of you who don't know you have to drive past Kelowna to get to Vancouver) and gave us a delivery date of December 1st and send us an invoice. When asked why they didn't deliver our belongings and instead took them to Vancouver they told us it was because we changed the delivery address, which makes no sense.

The invoice we received was for $3414.88. I was blown away, how could it be this much. Then I looked over the charges and realized this wasn't what we agreed to in the quote it. The surcharge to Kelowna quoted at $150 was $225, the $450 dollars that was suppose to be waived if the weight was over 2000 lbs was still there. The stairs charge and the wraps charge were there. I emailed them back telling them about all the inconsistencies I also told them I wanted a 10% discount because of the lateness of the delivery and the horrible customer service. I told them I had calculated using the quote and the weight they had written on the invoice (4640 lbs, which I think is high) and including the 10% discount the total I should be paying is $2239.27. They changed the quote to $3330. They changed one charge, the Kelowna surcharge. I emailed them back again telling them I was only paying what I was quoted. I never got a response back. 

The truck didn't show up on December 1st it showed up on December 3rd. I had a bank draft made out for the price I had told them I was paying. The driver wouldn't unload the truck until I payed him and I didn't want to pay him until he unloaded and I could see everything was there and nothing was broken. He refused so I called the Police. They arrived within 10 minutes. I showed the driver the cheque and he said it didn't match the invoice he had for $3330 so he again wouldn't unload. I explained the emails and he said he's just a driver and called the office. They told us pay the amount on the invoice or we don't get our stuff and they will take it to storage and hold it there until we pay. I said am not paying so they might as well take it to storage until we figure this out. The Police told me they couldn't make them give us our belongings but did think they were scamming us (implied and not in those words). We asked the driver for his number before he left and he wouldn't give it to us. After cooling down and talking to some people we decided to pay the invoice and take them to Small Claims Court. We called the moving company to ask them to send the truck back and they were closed, so we left a message. 

December 3rd was a Saturday. On Monday Dec 5th we called them to let them know we were willing to pay and to please send the truck back.They claim the driver left our stuff in the truck over night and tried to store it on Sunday here in Kelowna. They said nothing was open so they took our stuff to Calgary, where it now sits. We told them about trying to contact them on Saturday to come back and asked when they would now deliver. After calling them 4 times, each time being told they didn't know what was happening, we received an email stating that there was now another charge on top of the $3330 of $1450. We had to pay all that if we wanted them to deliver or belongings. 

We have to borrow money from family and use all of the money we have to pay what wasn't covered by my husbands new job. This means no buying groceries, gas or even Christmas presents unless we use a credit card. We have called every help line we can think of and we get the same answer. Pay them and take them to court. One place told us they we could start a file but it would take 10-12 weeks before anyone got to it, not helpful. If you happen to know someone or something that can help us please feel free to private message me with their information. We still plan on taking them to Small Claims court but know that even if we win we probably won't get our money as you have to enforce the judgment yourself. 

**TL:DR** We hired a moving company and they are extremely overcharging us and holding our belongings hostage and there is nothing we can do but pay them.

**Edit**The $4000 included meals, hotel &amp; gas to get from Toronto to Kelowna as well as the cost of movers

**Edit** Grammar

**UPDATE** We told the moving company that we would pay and asked for a delivery date. They told us Dec 22nd was the earliest and they wouldn't guarantee that there wouldn't be more charges. In light of that we have arranged for a family member that lives in Calgary to rent a truck and bring our belongings to us. The moving company told us if we do that we just have to pay the $3330, but lets see if they stick to it when my cousin shows up tomorrow morning. 

**UPDATE** WE HAVE OUR STUFF!!! It all looks to be here and in good condition. I haven't had a chance to open boxes and won't until we move in to our condo. My cousin and a friend rented a trailer, loaded and drove our stuff here. He informed me that A-2-Z was courteous and informed him that they found this post. I was surprised to hear that. I guess Troy Moving is unhappy with what I have to say from what he told me.

He has a longing to steal, lie, stay out late, and has no motivation to do well in anything, accept Runescape, even though he's 13. He expects our parents to give/get him anything he wants for nothing in return. He says he hates them, and would love to move out, but he constantly comes back to them for anything. 

My parents have done everything in their power to help him. They've driven 8 hours to get to a hotel and treatment facility, where they stayed for 5 1/2 weeks (With the hotel not payed for by insurance, and costing incredible amounts.), are currently sending him back and forth between mental hospitals. He's not getting any better, and every time they go to visit him, he says he can't wait to get back to breaking the law, which is the only thing keeping him going at the moment. 

Because he has aspergers, I used to hate him, for he was almost always mean to me, but now that's all changed. It doesn't feel like home without him, and It's getting progressively lonely, with me actually having a breakdown at school once.

It's incredibly hard to change him, because of the aspergers, which causes someone to focus in one one thing, typically what first satisfies him/her, so he has fixated on stealing/breaking the law. He's even gone into jail, made us go to court, and cost huge amounts in fines. Please, if you can, MMFB and suggest ways we can help him. He loves to code and do anything on computers, as do I, is fixated on Runescape, and loves to steal/break the law if that helps at all. Thanks for reading.

Life was shit growing up; I spent several years in a deep, deep depression where I withdrew almost completely from the world. About two years ago I made my first real friend (via World of Warcraft). I was very interested in her, but got friend zoned pretty hard. I was content with it, because at least now I had a friend I was close to. 

About a year back, at the patient encouraging of this friend, I started to pull myself out of it. Quit WoW, got into therapy, started exercising, about 6 months ago I moved out into the countryside with my father and started working and socializing where I could. I was doing good. Even met a girl, online but it was something, you know?

This last month or so everything has gone to shit. 

Things with the girl fell apart. It wasn't anything bad and I'm not angry about the circumstances. Things were just going better than the distance between us would allow, and distance was something neither of us could handle. We don't talk anymore. Upset as I was over this, it was something I could handle. I wasn't going to let it bring me down.

My stepmother lost her job, and my father's disability only brings in enough to pay the rent. I was helping where I could, but now I'm out of work as well. I scraped by doing freelance work (farm work, gardening, lumber, etc.) while searching for a full-time job (still doing this, still no luck). We're slowly starting to lose various utilities as we can't pay the bills, and we're desperately trying to find a new place to live. Hard times are nothing new to me. I'm not concerned about where things will end up, they'll work out.

I started to lose a lot of sleep a couple weeks ago. I'd sleep for an hour, then wake up thrashing around and feeling as though I were fighting something or someone off of me. So for a while I've been running on very little sleep, feeling numb because of it. It got to the point where I was so sleep deprived that I began hallucinating. It became really apparent to me how alone I was, and I became more haunted by this than I ever had before in my life.

I made a final push to get out of the friend zone with my friend. Rejected again. I can't handle the pain of being around them anymore, so they're fading out of my life. I still can't sleep. I have no friends now, no prospects, no work, therapy isn't working out very well because I can only afford to see them once a month, I'm losing my home. I feel like my progress is coming completely undone faster than I can react to it.

The final straw that caused me to write this post just happened a little while ago. I was looking forward to today. Gorging myself on food, distracted from everything for at least a little while. Then, *with the first bite of food I take on this glorious day*, I chip a fucking tooth. First bite of Thanksgiving food, and I chip a *FUCKING* TOOTH. Suddenly I'm livid with anger at everything in my life, and I'm not an angry person. I've spent my life avoiding anger because my childhood was ruined by angry people. Now I'm pissed off and depressed and I feel so tense that I might have a god damn aneurysm because of all the shit I seem destined to live with.

1313560419.0,19,self.MMFB,jlbcy,I married a Schizophrenic.,26,7,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/jlbcy/i_married_a_schizophrenic/,"I'm 23 and my husband is 27. We've been together since 2007 and married since 2010. Being young and staying married is hard enough without a mental illness, but somehow we've stuck it out this long. It's hard though, I won't lie. I'd like to share my story.

When we met, I had just turned 20. I was wild and still living with my parents. I was flighty and fun and off-the-wall. I was a waitress in a local restaurant and our mutual friend introduced us. He was the most handsome guy I had ever met and I instantly felt sparks. He was shy, yet charming. He wore a band tee and jeans and had a scruffy goatee and a gorgeous crooked smile. Our friend's wife wrote down my phone number and gave it to him. He called me the next day. 

He would stop by my restaurant every day and drink a cup of coffee and watch me. All my co-workers were jealous of me. ""Why isn't he here to see meeee?"" they would wine. I felt so alive back then. He made me feel amazing.

We hit it off immediately. It didn't take long for us to move quickly. It seems like the first three months of our relationship was about sex. On his bed, on the couch, the back of his car, the back of my Jeep, the back of his father's car, his grandparents' guest room bed. It was exhilerating. But it didn't stay that way. Before things could become more serious, he informed me of his illness. At the time, he was 24. He told me he had been diagnosed with Schizophrenia when he was 20. I was intrigued and almost found it exciting, being the weird kid that I was. I was into (and still am) morbid shit. Boy, was I in for a ride.

I had problems at home with my parents. I wanted to move, so we found a place and moved in together when we had been together only 6 months. I had never lived with a guy, ever. The place we chose was within our budget - the absolute ghetto. We had a 1-bedroom at $450/month (waaaay too much for the quality!) At the time, he had a decent job making $11/hour. I had a shitty fast food job making $6.50/hour. We scraped along for the first couple months .... and then he quit. Abruptly. Quit. He hated his boss. I flipped out and demanded that he find a new job so we wouldn't become homeless. He found a gas station job but kept it less than a year. It ended with a screaming match between him and his assistant manager. This is when he decided to tell me that this gas station job was his 32nd job in less than 10 years.

He told me that the medicine he was on wasn't really working and he couldn't shake the feeling that everyone he came into contact with was making fun of him. This angered him to the point of wanting to kill innocent customers - something he could only stifle with his cigarettes. I remember he smoked a lot back then, worse than he does now.

I was devastated.

He decided to try one more time to hold a job. This time he got a job at Wal-mart as an overnight stocker. He was left in a little room with a computer, learning the basics of the job through a video tutorial. This was pretty standard stuff, but he became completely overwhelmed, had a massive panic attack and walked out of the store. I think he had been there five hours.

With the help of his mother, we pursuaded him to consider Disability. He refused at first, but we finally coaxed him into it. He felt like a failure and didn't want to put the burden on me, but I stepped up and took the challenge. It turns out that a person can't be working for a year (thus proving their inability to work), so he wasn't allowed to even attempt another job for at least a year. This killed him, but he obliged. 

I ended up getting lucky and landed a job at the same place he made $11/hour, except I was in another department making $9.50/hour. I worked 60 hours a week and paid 100% of the bills, including his insane cigarette habit. It was the most difficult period of our lives, but we got through it. 

When he was awarded Social Security Disablity in 2009, we were so relieved. He started paying the rent direcrly from his check each month so that our biggest bill would be taken care of and we wouldn't have to worry as much. It was around this time that my company downsized and a lot of people were laid off - including me. After living in the ghetto apartment for two years, we decided to move. 

We're now living in the boonies (the country for all you city folk) and we're happy, for the most part. My husband has been on Disablity for two years and out of work for almost three years. His paycheck pays our rent and he's left with only $149 extra after it's paid. He's lonely and doesn't have many friends. The ones he did have don't bother coming around anymore because he doesn't have a job and can't afford to go have fun. We were in a car accident two years ago that resulted in a $10,000 lawsuit on the lady's part. It wasn't our fault and our insurance had lapsed the day prior because the mail system lost my car insurance check and we were not aware we were driving without insurance. Thankfully the lady wasn't hurt but now we're forced to bankrupt (that plus all our medical bills and other crap). My husband's license was taken away and now he can't drive. We only have one vehicle (I'm paying it off) and I use it to get to work. I work in a restaurant full-time and make almost as good of money as I did at the last job, but we have more bills now that we're more established. We're doing a little better, but he's still so depressed, isolated and miserable. He spends his days playing Call of Duty online. He says he's okay, but I know he isn't. I'm gone at work ALL the time and he's here with the cat. 

Through all this, my husband has been in therapy. The only problem is, he won't tell them the truth about what happened to him as a child. I'm not a psychiatrist, but I do believe that illnesses like Schizophrenia are with you from birth, yet I also believe that certain factors in your early life can trigger the symptoms. For example, my husband suffered from horrific sexual abuse from two different family members and he started showing symptoms of Schizophrenia a few years later. He chased his poor mother through the house with a butcher knife at the age of eight. He cornered her and threatened her life at fourteen, but she didn't press charges. He claims that he barely remembers these instances. 

He had a lot of hate for his stepmother. This was mostly due to the fact that she was his father's mistress and she's the mother of his half-brother, who is a spoiled brat. He doesn't have a very solid family foundation aside from his mother. His father is a rootin' tootin' cowboy truck driver who told him to ""suck it up"" and ""work like a real man"". He believes my husband can turn his symptoms off and on. He's wrong.

He was always a lover of horror movies and that love still rings true today. He can quote you EVERY line from Psycho, Evil Dead, Halloween (and all the sequels) and so on and so forth. He's seen them all over 300 times each, I kid you not. He has an unhealthy obsession with serial killers. He's told me that, as a child, he looked up to them. He understood how they felt and wanted to become them when he was older. 

He is currently on 1000mg of Depakote and 250mg of Zoloft. This is his fifth medicine combination in three years. It seems to be working fairly well for him, although things get ugly when he's running low. Thankfully, the place he goes to for therapy works with us due to our income so we can pay for his medicine. It's my responsibilty to make sure he has it, and I slip up every now and then. One time, we couldn't afford his medication for 6 weeks. It was hell.

When he doesn't have his medication, it takes anywhere from 5-8 days for him to start acting ""different"" and about two weeks for him to go into full-on ""oh shit"" mode. He'll become more withdrawn, more concentrated. He's irritable and angry. He'll sit and sway back and forth for hours. He believes I'm up to something and I won't tell him the truth. He won't look me in the eye when I'm trying to talk sense into him. He'll twitch and whisper to himself and start scratching at his head and punching himself in the jaw. When he becomes angry, his eyes remind me of a scared raccoon who knows he's about to be shot with a rifle. His expression is intense and terrifying. Simple conversations go out the window. To cope with it, he'll sleep. He's slept for 6 days straight before. He only got up to pee and drink water and would go straight back to sleep. He's no longer my husband.

Why am I typing all of this out? It's therapeutic for me, and I'd like to know if anyone has ever been in a relationship with a Schizophrenic. How do you deal with it? Most of the time, when it gets bad for us, I call my Grandmother and let it all out. Other times I just take a hot shower and cry for what feels like hours. Why do I do this to myself, you may ask. Some days I just don't know. But to be honest, I do it out of love... because when he's on his meds like he should be, he's the fun and vibrant man I fell in love with. I'm terrified of our future. I'm so scared that his mind will turn into mush and I'll have to sign him over to a mental hospital. I've read up on other situations like mine and the outcome is usually pretty grim. Schizophrenics, as a whole, gradually get worse with time. Most are in hospitals at the later part of their lives and most are abandoned by their loved ones... either by choice or by suicide. At least this is what I've read.

What I *want* to read is hope. I want to hear that I'm not alone. I've been faithful to my husband all this time. I'm not ugly, and I could easily find another man if I truly wanted to. I honestly love him and worry that if it wasn't for me, he would be on the street. I don't know who else to turn to. Help, reddit?

MMFB",22,5,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/1j25vi/i_male_26_just_kinda_broke_up_with_my_best_friend/,"Sorry this might be long, and I'm not even sure if this is the right sub but I just kinda gotta write about this.

So, this afternoon, due to recent events, I had a talk with I would describe as my best (female) friend but love interest, and we kinda sorta broke up, or put our freindship on hiatus. How this came to be is a quite complex story but I'd like to walk you through it.

I've been a shy and slightly socially akward kid. I never really had trouble finding friends, but I was more on the quiet, friendly, observing and following end of the spectrum. People always have and continue to make me very nervous, and naturally I had an especially hard time getting to know girls. My first relationship happened when I was 18, and suffice it to say that low self-esteem, self doubt and anxiety turned this into a train wreck over the course of six months, after which she ended the relationship because I didn't have the balls to do so. After graduating from highschool I went through a weird phase where I gained a lot of unnecessary weight and had a bad overall look, so my non-extistent chances with the ladies and my social feedback didn't exactly increase my ego. By that time I already had a feeling that I might be depressed (thinking back I might have been so since I was around 16) and when I started to study at university I really was stuck in a rut. I did things but I was generally miserable. Around this time I met the girl in question and she was the polar opposite to me: She was confident, sociable, popular, incredibly pretty and just communicated joy of life with everything she did. 

Lacking the required, uhm, ""alpha traits"" (I don't like this term a lot, but it pretty much boils down to this) I naturally didn't just confidently walk up to her and have a talk, show some interest and see where things could go. I immeadiately put her on a pedastol and admired her from afar. As time went by, we started to hang out via mutual friends and after a while I got enough courage together to tell her I liked her. She softly rejected me and I kinda was OK with us just being friends for the time being. However, by that time I had really fallen for her and instead of getting better (physically, mentally, socially) for my own good and move on, I unconsciously started doing things for her, for the off chance that if I got good enough she would accept me. We hung out more and more and ended up as best friends and pretty much shared everything together. Over time we had quite a few talks about how we felt for each other and the verdict was pretty much the same every time, that I wanted to be with her but she wanted to be freinds. Later, this changed to freinds with benefits for her (meaning she would have enjoyed fooling around with me but still not consider anything serious). You have to understand that she is a very sexually positive person but at the same time very bad with committment. I would see guy after guy come and go, she totally enjoying herself and I more or less openly devastated with jealousy and shredded self-worth.

I went abroad for a year and things started to get better. I felt like I was getting more confident in myself as a person and the distance and the lack of contact we had gave me some air to breathe. However, when interacting with other women she would always pop into my head as the one and only, so all fooling around was just distraction and never very engaging for me. When I got back I started therapy for social anxiety and depression, but I really felt the two of us had had enough time apart to have everything put in perspective, and maybe I was finally able to let my romantic aspiartions go and just enjoy the deep friendship and respect we had for each other. So for roughly one year all was well, she would tell me some stuff about guys and I wouldn't mind, but last weekend something happened that made me completely loose my marbles.

She visited me and was supposed to stay at my place and we went to party with a few friends and aquaintances. As it all happened, she made a move on such an aquaintance, a guy I wasn't really close with but whom I liked as a person. He reprocitated and that night she didn't stay at my place, and I completely lost my shit.

We had a talk two days later where I told her that, even suprising for myself, I was totally pissed at the situation, at the two of them and at myself for still being this petty. We had a good and long talk and re-evaluated our freindship and what to do with it, and she said as the guy wasn't really pushing things in a specific direction anyways, they probably wouldn't end up together. So for 24 hrs I was reliefed and thought maybe I could continue on my path of becoming better for my own sake and accept her freindship for what it is. The following evening however, when she was supposed to stay with a mutual female freind of ours, she ended up sleeping at his place. And the following three nights until she left town again.

So this afternoon we had a talk and I wanted to know what was going on and if she remembered our talk from before. She told me she really liked this guy and I told her that I could not continue this way. I had analyzed our relationship before and tried to phrase things simple: I ffeel we probably never had a real freindship, but rather that I was sometimes more sometimes less still hoping for the two of us to end up together. I told her that I was pissed that she made a move on somebody I frequently run into, because there was no way for me to avoid this situation when I wanted to hang out with my friends. I told her it pissed me off how this guy, who of course is naturally confident and sociable, can pull off in one evening what I had (sometimes unconciously) tried to pull off over the course of 5 friggin years. I told her I was not yet going to cut her out of my life completely, but that I would drastically cut down our contact and keep that option should things get to painful for me. I also told her, and I firmly believe that, that she has no fault, aside from choosing that guy. It wouldn't have been different with anyone else, and I was simply a low self-esteem jealousy time bomb waiting for a reason to blow. To quote myself: ""She was the right woman at the wrong time and place, and I was the wrong guy from the very beginning."" We ended the talk on sad but good terms, concluding that time would show how things played out and that I would break off contact as much as possible (mutual friends...) if the cycle would begin again. I finally have to move on, and while it hurts so bad to forcefully push her out of my life it's the right things to do. She will never give me what I want, I will never be what she wants and this kind of relationship is neither a true friendship nor honest love nor worthy of anyone involved.
 
I feel weirdly betrayed, my self-esteem is crushed again, I can't stand the idea of having to interact with a guy that until recently was a likeable dude to me, I already miss her and I feel like a junkie on withdrawal. I hate my brain and myself. And in the midst of all this I realize how little outside of this weird relationship I did over the past 5 years to actually and honestly meet other people. Full on quarter-life crisis, feeling too old to do the stuff young students do and just a general wave of sadness and depression washing over me.

Thanks for reading, sorry for the long post and please help me make me feel better.

Most of the time for legit reason, other times just because I felt like an embarrassing friend, and I'd be doing them a favor. But eventually, it whittled down to me just having my girlfriend at my side. She understood, and I was glad she did... but then she broke up with me. Why? Oh, no reason. Just because. Literally. That's it. She stopped having feelings for me. I did nothing wrong. She figuratively told me, ""tough luck chump, good luck getting a new girlfriend eventually."" I can't talk to her anymore. It hurts me too much. I don't even dare looking at her twitter or tumblr anymore in fear she'll be swooning over another guy after she told me I was irreplaceable. Which WILL happen, she's 19 god damn years old but it she doesn't act like it. Moving on. I got to saying ""At least I have..."" and then I basically went into shock. I had no one now. No friends from school which I used to talk to, no friends who I was awkward around. I have no one. I have made new friends, here and there. I got into contact with a friend I should have been talking to more and she actually made the post-breakup a little easier. I also made friends here and there from dumb homestuck rp because I'm a huge faggot. But, here's the thing. I'm scared to talk to them. I'm scared to be their friend. I don't want to feel the ache of losing one more friend. I'm scared of being a terrible friend, and I'm scared of terrible friends. I can socialize mostly fine now, but I'm not sure if I even should.

In the beginning, he said things that made me think that he wanted a relationship. After we fucked, he said he just wanted sex and wasn't sure if it would turn to anything more. I accepted this because I really liked him and wanted him happy. I told him he was so special to me but I would try to just be his friend.

I would message him everyday asking how he is. I would send him cute pictures of things he liked. And when we fucked, I did everything I could do to make him happy. I worshiped his cock, swallowed his cum, did anal, etc. Anything for him.

Well, the other day he wrote a Facebook post about how alone he was. He ended up getting into a  conversation with a couple people where he complained that women didn't wanna talk to him and a girl recently rejected. He even said ""who would want a NICE guy like me"".

I didn't even know he was talking to another girl.

This hurt life a knife. What's wrong with me? Obviously he finds me attractive. When we hang out, we laugh and have the most fun. I don't have a prison record. What is it that's so bad about me?

So I ended up sending two super long paragraphs of emotionally charged bullshit to him. That's the most embarrassing part. I'm cringing now. I'm sincerely thinking about deleting Facebook (how we communicate) or blocking him. 

I mean, I was just good for sex. I get it.

I try to think of things about him so I can feel better about this, like he's an alcoholic...he's generally an asshole...etc. But I can't. Deep down, he's a special guy. 

And for some reason I'm not good enough.

Should I delete him? I mean, yeah, right?

Is it possible to die of embarrassment?

Now, I hate this fucking place and only went because one of my friends convinced me to come. Anyway, when I got there, the girls I was with were ahead of me, so it wasn't clear that I was part of their group. As soon as I got to the door, this fucking stupid meathead fuckwit of a bouncer asked me how many drinks I'd had that night, I said 3, which was the fucking truth. I stand there talking to him for a minute, trying to convince him that it wasn't a fucking lie to no avail.

So I rang my friends, told them I wouldn't get in, and waited in the middle of fucking no-where for them to come out because it was my only way home. So it's like less than 15 degrees centigrade outside probably, and, thinking I was going to get into this place, I left my jumper in the car. So I was now outside in the cold. NO-one would come out and so much as give me a fucking JUMPER, never mind keeping me company.

I waited outside for close to 3 hours, until I saw other people I knew, but weren't exactly friendly with, they were refused entry as well so they called a cab to go somewhere else. Because these guys are evidently far better people than my apparent friends, they offered to give me a lift home in the cab. I thanked them profusely and tried to give them $20 because it only seemed fair, they insisted I keep it, because they thought I was having a shit night.

So the next day, I was incredibly pissed off at what had happened, and had friends telling me how much of an awesome night they had, even though they knew I felt like shit. One of them even laughed at me because he thought it was so fucking hilarious. I was so pissed off that I snapped at several of them, including ones not even present the night before. I pretty much apologized immediately, because it wasn't fair of me to take it out of them like that, but I feel like I've done damage to those relationships now.

So basically, I'm pissed off for being refused entry, and it's made worse by the fact that people who I previously thought to be my closest friends wouldn't even afford me the courtesy of coming out and giving me a jumper, then going back in, even though I would have fucking LEFT the club and kept them company in the same position.

FML",21,4,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/1837jf/update_i_dumped_the_best_girlfriend_ever_but_i/,"So after 4 days of not talking to each other, I sent her a long email explaining that I did indeed still want to be with her. I told her that she has been on my mind ever since I broke up with her and that I was sorry to hurt her and that if she wanted we could get together and talk. I am not the best at these types of things so I didn't even expect an email back from her. 

She emailed me back and said that she missed me more then anything in this world and that she needed to see me. It almost scared me how..needy she was seeming at this point, but then I realized I needed her too. In the months we have been together, she never expressed how much she needed me, only through her actions, like being affectionate, sex, and spoiling me. (like I did to her) 

So we met up after work at her place. She was so happy to see me and we hugged for a long time without saying anything, and I'm pretty sure she cried a bit, but right when she let go of me she didn't look at me and went to the bathroom. She came back looking a little sad to see me. We sat down on the couch together and sort of further away then normal. She said it was so weird to be near me but not able to touch me. 

I told her that without her in my life I felt empty. I have never felt that way before. I said I wanted to be with her more then anything and that if she wanted we could be together. I'm not the best at wording everything, so she told me I didn't have to explain and that she is very sure she wants to be with me. We kind of sat there in awkward silence and not sure what to do and then she just started to giggle, so I opened my arms up to have her come hug me and she did. 

We spent the rest of the night cuddling on the couch and even made out a bit. I didn't even think about having sex with her, I just thought how great it was to have her in my arms again....

I know I won't fuck this up again and the whole 'love' thing is still in question, but I do know she is exactly the kind of girl that I want to fall in love with. Going to her place again after work and we are going to the movies and dinner, so I hope I can really show her tonight how much I want to be with her and I hope I haven't made her insecure now.

And I know, in theory, that it's not true, that at least, I'm average.

As if I'm beyond fixing. 

I used to have a healthy dose of confidence when it comes to my looks. I had good days and bad days, just like anyone else, but I guess at some point last year I started having more bad days at the expense of good days and slowly but surely, I didn't even notice it at first, but every day was a bad day, and still is. 

I take care of myself. I do my hair, wear make-up, I've even started working out because I honestly don't know what else to do, but it's not making me feel any better. I have great friends and an amazing boyfriend and all of them keep telling me I look good. It's not that I don't believe it - I just don't feel it. It can really bring my mood up to hear these things, but at the end of the day, I think I shouldn't be building my confidence on the foundation of other people's opinions. I just can't convince myself that I'm not horribly ugly, no matter what I do and no matter how much I know, on a rational, logical level, that it's not that bad. 

I have been going through some other issues, deaths in my family, not being able to find a job, health issues, so I know that must have contributed as well, however, I used to have problems and hardships before and I endured as the same person I was before. And now... I just don't know where all my confidence has gone.

MMFB,21,3,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/13o4og/i_was_informed_yesterday_that_i_have_lost_most_of/,"Okay, a quick summary of events. Two years ago, my fiance and I were sharing an apartment with my sister and her two kids when our bedroom got infested with bedbugs. My sister didn't want to move (""The kids need stability, I don't want to move again."" was how she put it). We couldn't afford to live in the city we both had grown up in and due to our desperation to get away from the bugs I had to quit my awesome job and move in with his mother 500 miles away. However, we also couldn't afford a moving truck so we loaded up our two-door Cavalier with as much stuff as we could with the understanding that we would return for our things at a later date. Last year our Dad died suddenly and after that my sister hooked up with a loser that knocked her up, caused her to lose her job and stole all of her savings from her. She couldn't pay her rent and she lost the apartment. She is now living with a friend. She didn't bother to tell me that my things were in danger of being lost and said that some of our stuff was in storage. This happened two months ago. She only informed me of this yesterday and then refused to speak to me about it when I burst into tears. 

I have no idea what is gone but I'm going to assume it's pretty much everything. I am devastated. I couldn't sleep last night because I kept thinking about all of the things that we've lost. Books, clothes, collectibles, furniture, records, CDs, childhood toys...all rotting in the Johnston landfill. I keep trying to tell myself that it was just stuff but some of it was pretty valuable stuff, like the Soviet-era silverware that we got from an actual Soviet defector and some of it was sentimental, like the roll-top desk my grandmother gave me and the music box that belonged to his great-grandmother.

In summary, my parents passed away this year, lost health insurance, my school decided to revoke my financial aid for two previous semesters (so I owe them $6k), I lost my job recently and my boyfriend just got relocated to his hometown 3 hours away for work. I live in an 1100 sq. ft. house by myself, and as a generally social person, I'm depressed all the time. Before my parents' passing, I wasn't the happiest person either but now I just don't know what to do with myself. I reach out to my friends, however they have their own lives and I can't expect them to be around 24/7. I see a therapist, but while she is a good therapist and I'm comfortable around her, I don't know if she can help. I cry almost every day and I have a lack of desire to do anything I once enjoyed. I apply for jobs still, but I have no hope of actually getting a position, even the ones that are not in my trade.

This has all happened fairly recently, but its like every time I do something good for myself, I take one step forward and 7 steps back. I am so trapped and the thought of being completely helpless physically hurts me. 

On top of that, I was diagnosed with skin cancer (squamous cell carcinoma) when I was 14, and deemed cancer-free at 20. I still had to go through radiation and preventative chemo because the growth had reached sub-dermal levels. I'm 23 now and I've noticed moles that have grown in such a way that worry me. I'm Eastern European, and we generally have a tendency to have these growths. Needless to say, I can't afford any type of check-up or office visit that can test to make sure these growths aren't a cause to worry.

I don't know what to do. I'm scared because I don't feel like I have a future and no one seems to care. The family that I do have, doesn't talk to me, especially my aunt who promised my mom she would watch over me (I've seen her 3 times in the past 6 months since my mom passed away).

I was having a lot of fun with him, and I was pretty excited thinking that maybe things were getting more serious. 

Stupid me. That was the last time I talked to him. The weekend after, he told me he had to work and the next time I texted him to hang out, he just never responded. A few days ago he updated his relationship status on Facebook, and his new girlfriend is absolutely stunning. She seems like a cool chick and I want to be happy for this guy, but I'm so hurt. He didn't even have the decency to say ""Hey I'm seeing someone else, so I can't hang out with you anymore."" Just completely stopped talking to me.

Ive not been feeling great today, my past is really starting to get on top of me lately. Im not really homeless, as such. I have a place to sleep, but I have no where to really call home.

I guess i should start with my parents, thats where it all begins really. Im a student, and i work part time, its not very well paid, but its a job, and its a good foot in the door for what could become a career. My parents are divorced and live seperately. They  *HATE* eachother, and throughout my childhood always tried to convince me and my brother the other was evil, this led to a lot of moving, a lot of not talking to one parent or the other, and a lot of upset. Neither of my parents are ideal, but my dad is by far the worst, sadly he convinced me for a long time my mum was the worst. My dad is a lazy, violent, stupid, unemployed, angry alcoholic. I did however, for some reason live with him until a few weeks ago. He got very drunk, tried to ride his motorbike, i said dont do that, and confronted him about his alcoholism. long story short, he threatened to hit me, me and my brother decided to leave. My brother left, i was about to leave but he wouldnt let me leave the house, he ended up beating me up, and i hd to run out the back and jump a few fences to get away from him. I called the police and he was arrested that night. Hes not a nice person.

My mum is a lot lot nicer, and at least has good intentions, but shes an extremely difficult person to live with, she puts you constnatly on edge, you cant do anything right in her eyes, and she makes everyday life incredibly stress full. Sorry thats enough about my parents. I hadnt seen my mum for about 2 years (or spoken to hr at all) until a few weeks ago when my dad went nuts on me. Im living at hers now, and she tolerates me. But its very vdery clear shes very upset with me, and dosent particularly like me. Wedont talk much, and i keep out of her way as much as possible. I understand that shes hurt by me not seeing her for so long, but i dont know what i can do to fix it. At the moment shes letting me live in my old room from when i was a kid, but I know this wont last more than a few weeks more. 

As you can tell im not at all close to either of my parents, the person i was closest to was my brother, hes 16, but hes got his head screwed on. Hes normally pretty intelligent, and a nice person. But hes extremely confused by what happened when my dad attacked me, and my dad has managed to manipulate him to think i attacked my dad, and im the bad one. Despite the fact that I decided NOT to press charges on my dad, so he doesnt spend his final months in prsion (forgot to mention he has stage 3 cancer in his bladder, lungs and liver, and probably has a few m onths to live, but im not too bothered by this). But if id made a statement, and taken it to court, he WOULD be in prsion right now. I decided for that not to happen. and im STILL the one doing wrong, i dont get it.
 So basically my brother thinks im a horrible person and is totally blanking me, he wont even acknowledge my existence.

So at the moment im living out of plastic bags in a bare room in my mums house, with a bunch of people who realy dont like me. My mum wants me gone, anywhere. And my brother/dad hate my guts.

There is one more really big thing thats upset me for the last few months, my ex girlfriend. We met on a forum not to dissimilar to reddit, on the live chat. We where both young, just finished high school. We fell completely in love. I travelled over 200 miles by train to see her every week, then when she moved i travaled even further, and kept our relationship togethor. She was my first, and last girlfriend, the first time id had sex, my first kiss, even my first hug. I loved her to bits, she was my everything, she was what made everything bad about the world ok. She was my reward for enduring the less pleasent aspects of life.  But they say all good things must end, our relationship got a little rocky, she expressed how she didnt like the distance, and started acquiing a few male friends. And seeing them more than me. I saw it coming but it still landed like a punch in the face, she cheated on me with a guy from her course. For a few months i was just a broken person. COmpletely brokn, but i picke myself up eventually and carried on with life. Im over her and i dont want her back, towards the end of our relationship she wasnt a very nice person. But i still dream avout her most nights. And most of my idle thoughts are about her. I have 2 recurring dreams.

The first is a little graphic, sorry. We are doing it in her room with these candles she always liked burning, all I can see is her back, and I reach down and give her a hug. The second was this time we had a shower togethor, we where bored, and kinda cold. And decided to jump in the shwoer togethor. I can picture it so vividly, her standing infront of me, and her brown hairs all wet. it really kinda shines, and looks nice. I give her a kiss kiss on her head, and she looks up at me and smiles. She has a really beutiful smile, she jsut looks at me and her expression perfectly captures how we both feel, and she gives me a kiss on the lips and the dream ends.

So thats about it i think for my story. Im just feeling really, really lonely at the moment, and I needed to get this off my chest. Im so uncomfortbale, and unwelcome where im living at the moment. But i have no where else to go.

Sadly most of my money for the last 2 years went on train tickets to see my ex, so I dont have a great deal of money saved up. Im on the second year of my course, so Im thinking of quiting the second year, and doing the rest of it in a few years, working full time for a few months, then renting a tiny flat or something. I worked it out and I can *just* afford it, if i save for a few months. What id really love more than anything is another cat, and my own tiny shitty flat. My human skills are pretty fucked up after all thats happened, and i deffintiely get on best with animals. So id love kroe than anyhting another cat to cuddle, and be with.

My boyfriend has decided to make zero effort in making me feel even a little bit special.  He's been moaning about his game crashing all day, we had fairly lacklustre sex in which I didn't even reach the point of attempting to orgasm before he came and fell asleep.

At the moment I live with my boyfriend's sister and his two children.  His sister has been complaining all day of a shoulder problem, which she can't help, but my offers to help around the house i.e. do the washing, do the cooking etc have been met with no thanks or apology.

And now I am home alone, looking after the two sleeping children while my boyfriend waits for two hours in A&amp;E with his sister, which is kind of him, but again, no thank you, no ""sorry I'm leaving you alone on your birthday"" or anything.  Not even a phone call to say how long they'll be.

So I'm sat drinking a glass of wine trying to convince myself that all of this is ok, knowing that nobody really cares its my birthday except me, knowing that it takes a lot of effort to give me a bit of love and attention for a day...I know this, but it still makes me feel like crap.

We have a child on the way. It was unexpected, unplanned, and we're not entirely ready for this and not entirely thrilled about it, but we're adults (both 38) and we're going to be parents, so we'll make it work. I have two children from my prior marriage, who are wonderful despite their mother, who &lt;insert clever ex-wife joke&gt;.

Problem. Our yet-to-be-born child has Down syndrome. Tough break, right? You know, I think in my selfish moments sometimes that every parent who has a Down syndrome child in their home has already been through the worst of it. The worst part? The pregnancy.

My son (we learned the gender through the genetic screening) only has a 66% chance of survival to term. Depending on who you ask it might be more like 40%. For the science geeks - nuchal translucency was over 6mm. 50% chance of serious heart defect requiring surgery. Think about that - heart surgery on a newborn baby. It could be that when he's born he'll have to be flown 5 hours away via air ambulance so that they can do emergency heart surgery. He may have bowel deformities requiring surgery. Thyroid problems. Good lord, the list is unbelievable. You know how always hear 'mother and child are doing fine' when someone talks about a birth?

That is almost certainly not going to be us.

My home is filled with tears, stress, anger and fear. I'm worried I'm sinking into depression. In anger I threw a printer at my basement wall last week. (I recommend the all-in-ones, the scanner glass makes a satisfying sound) 

My brain says 'everything is probably going to be fine' but 'probably' is a nightmare word when it comes to your child's life. I just want him to be born healthy, smile at me and grow up enough that we can watch Star Wars together. I just want to be a father to him, and he may die before I get the chance. I haven't met this boy yet, only seen him on the ultrasound and yet I love him so much, I can't imagine losing him.

How am I going to get through five more months of this?

EDIT: Terminating the pregnancy isn't an option. Not for religious or moral reasons, but just because of who we are -  we wouldn't be able to live with ourselves if we'd decided that our son shouldn't live just because he's got developmental problems.

Second Edit, a little less polite: Telling me to kill my child is not going to make me feel better.

She even went to university in a different province, but I called her almost every night and talked. At the end of her university when we were preparing to move in together, she cheated on me. It broke my heart, especially because she was Christian and ""waiting for marrige"" then gave it up to a guy who she had known for 2 weeks. I was hurt and pissed.

Despite this, I still tried to remain friends after she broke up with that guy. It was hard, and eventually we deicided just to be civil and not connect much unless in social situations. This also dissolved as she got pissed off when I mentioned her cheating on me a year after it happened. She threw a fit and we cut all communication.

Since then I have met another girl, and even had a baby boy who turned 1 year old a few months ago. Yet every now and then she comes from nowhere, on facebook or at my work, and just says hurtful things about how I am an idiot, how she was the best I would ever had and she is gone, how I ruined my life.

I know I am better then that and they are just cheap insults, but this is seriously the only person in my adult life that I actually wish terrible things upon. Things that make me ashamed, I want her hurt, I want her broken down, I want her to lose all her firends. There are times even when I wish someone would rape her to make her feel like nothing.

My neighborhood is mostly poor Hispanic families. No one my age lives here, and I can't go to bars to make friends. I miss open mics, I miss protests, I miss learning, I miss being around beautiful, smart people. My friends are happy to see me, but I'm always a tourist when I visit. I can't be part of their bands and clubs and running-jokes. I miss having a girlfriend, I miss honesty, I miss cuddling. I isolate myself: whenever someone is romantically interested in me I lose attraction or talk myself out of making a move. I've blown so many chances, I have so many regrets. 


I miss sex. I sometimes go to parties on weekends but I only drink a little (I exercise 3x/week; plus half of ER patients are dying of alcoholism) so I can't talk over WUB WUB WUB and I'm scared of being a person that just grabs chicks and starts humping ass and so I crash on a friend's couch and feel shitty the next day.

She broke up with me about a month and a half ago after a two and a half year relationship. I was completely in love with her and didn't expect it at all.

As to be expected, I was destroyed inside. It has overwhelmed me with sadness.

We were still getting on until about a week ago. I was at her house to pick up my passport and have a quick catch up when she asked me to set something up on her laptop, but when I opened it there was a letter to another guy open. It honestly looked like a letter she had sent me, with my name replaced with his, and with a different title. At the bottom she told him she loved him. I felt like my heart had stopped. Especially because I know how much writing a someone a letter means to her. She only does it with the people that mean the most to her.

I know who the guy is and I always worried about him and her, but whenever i brought it up she denied it and I believed her because I thought she'd never lie to me.

It has literally been a month and a half and she is already telling this guy she loves him. It either means she is confused and rebounding or (more likely) she had a thing with him while we were still officially together.

What is even worse is she told me she broke up with me because she couldn't trust the way I acted around other girls. I was friendly with other girls, but never dishonest or unfair - and what is even worse than that is she has told everyone that she knows and even my friends that I was the unfair one.

Now I have no one, she has another guy, and I still look like the evil one.

I feel like my life is grinding to a halt. I am still in love with her, and we did so much together. The hardest part for me is that I always thought I would have her then when times got hard and now that I want to be with her the most, I can't.

I'm so scared that if I don't get my shit together I'm only going to plunge in to a deeper state of depression. I have a history of depression as does my family. My brother went through a similar situation at my age involving a girl and he went to an incredibly dark place.

(girl problems)

I've been with this one girl I am madly and deeply in love with, and have been this way for as long as we've been together.  
She really pulled me out of a massive slump in my life, and I have become dependant on being with her, she is my only friend, and so much more than that.

Recently she moved far away from me for a greater education, I would move to her in a heartbeat if I could, but it's not an option I have unfortunately..  

We agreed to try a long distance relationship, and as much as people say they never work, I was coping just fine.. But apparently she wasn't.. There was another guy, who liked her. She never told me most of this to keep me feeling secure, as I am usually quite insecure and such.

Anyway, whenever I open chrome (I am a firefox user), it always signed into her facebook.. And there was this message, from this one guy.. They had apparently met and watched movies before together, just the two of them, no intimate conversations, and it seems like purely friends.. I didn't want to ask about it to not seem like I invaded her privacy in anyway.

I finally bought it up, since it was eating away at me on the inside, and apparently they were developing feelings for each other.  
Come out two year ""anniversary"" (just been together for 2 years, no marriage). I send her flowers, etc. And she breaks up with me the next day, I find out a few days later that she has been getting intimate with this guy ever since we broke up (and they even attempted to do the deed), all since we had broken up.

Knowing I don't want to lose her, I immediately book last minute flights to go see her for the weekend. We spend an amazing weekend together, but the whole weekend, she has him set in her heart.. After an amazing weekend, she's in tears and can't decide between the two of us. But tells me she needs someone there with her and I can't be that person.. Since then I've come home and being home is worse than ever. I hate being away from her, and my life is not worth living anymore. I can't find any reasons to be happy, and this city I live in is the biggest shithole filled with idiots and dropouts.

She says she still loves me, and can't bear to lose me as a friend. I want to be there for her, and I always do, but being friends only makes me miss her more, I've done everything I possibly can to get her to reconsider, but she won't even give me a chance and it hurts more and more by the day. I also am losing her more and more by the day.

Also, I know there are plenty of fish in the sea, but I also need something to pull me out of this rutt that I am in now, and I can't get her off my mind..

But awhile ago, I started getting feelings for her. I think about her more than I should, I miss her when she's away, and I just want to be with her more than I should.

She's already seen other people before and I haven't felt jealousy, so I'm not worried about that. I just want her to be happy with someone and I have some absurd hope that I could be that guy.

- I always have to check expiration dates on food. 
- I am wary of eating in restaurants - I can't see how the food is prepared and I don't get to check the expiration dates.

- I almost refused to take anything for my anxiety because I was afraid it would make me ill. 
- For a while, I suffered from anorexia because I was afraid to eat.

I repeat: *not a single question was fully answered*. This has NEVER happened to me.

This midterm is 18% of my mark. What if it happens again?

I am not a flirty person. I grew up isolated from most people so I'm very awkward and I don't wear makeup, dresses, etc. I dress mostly in men's clothing and the most feminine thing I do is get periods.

My personality is abrasive and confrontational. I get told often that my humor is mean spirited. Also, I am not very attractive, honestly. I'm saying this because the problem I am having is so goddamn confusing to me.

Ever since high school, I will get at least a couple of male friends confessing their affections for me. It is not a matter of physical attraction, I've just had a fucked up life so I don't want to be in a relationship where I am responsible for another person's happiness. Having the power to make them extremely happy or devastated scares me, and I have yet to have feelings for someone else. (No, I am not a lesbian.)

I do have true friends, the kind that would never leave you and will always support you, but they are females. I connect better with men, but somehow, I have maintained a healthy friendship with these girls. Trust me, I am ecstatic that I have *several* friends who like me. Going from having no friends in my childhood to having someone I can talk to makes  me infinitely happy. Anyways.

After one of my male friends confess their feelings, I have always politely and gently rejected them. Of course, it is hard to be their friend afterwards. They always end up drifting away or demanding I give them a chance. Honestly, I don't want to. I want to be alone for the rest of my life. I don't want romance. I also don't want to give it a shot when I know that I am not physically or emotionally attracted to them. Yes, we get along but I don't want to date you. Like I've mentioned before, I have had a very fucked up life. Lots of sexual abuse, which is the main reason I don't want to date anyone. I don't want to have sex with anyone, I have never felt the need to. I know not every man is going to hurt me sexually, but the thought of being kissed disgusts me. Of being touched. Of dating and being lovey-dovey. It sickens me completely.

I have had three friends confess to me last month. Two of them are absolutely awful about it. I said no, and then they both started calling me in the middle of the night, yelling at me or demanding that I give them a shot. Why is it such a problem that I don't want to fake it? They *want* me to. They want me to and when I said it would be leading them on and that I am uncomfortable with it, they turn even more furious.

I tell them that they will meet a girl who is lovely and kind and patient but they won't fucking listen to me.

The last friend accepted it and we maintained what I thought was a friendship, but he sent me a link to his blog where he wrote poetry and blog posts about me and how he wanted to die and kill himself.

Honestly, I am terrified and uncomfortable around people and this shit just makes me want to cut off all ties with society and just live out my life alone. Every time I think I made a friend I've connected with, he does this and harasses me about dating until ultimately cursing at me and cutting me out completely while talking shit about me.

He broke up with me when my depression became too much of an emotional burden to him, but we had reconnected and were seeing each other again. He lost his job, stopped leaving his house, and made the decision to return to live with his parents and potentially check himself into psychiatric care voluntarily.

He didn't get that far. On Tuesday night he was drinking and decided to overdose on his antidepressants. He realized shortly thereafter what a mistake he had made, and called 911.

He was unconcious Wednesday.

Thursday he woke up and called the one friend whose number he had memorized. She was in Kansas. She called me and I spent all day in the hospital.

I was with him when he was still on one of the medical floors, holding his hand while they waited to transfer him to psych. I gave him his last kiss before they moved him into the locked ward where you cannot kiss visitors.

I sat with him in the most depressing day room imaginable because visiting hours were right when they transferred him. I held his hand and tried not to cry.

He told me that this is what hell is.

I don't have anybody irl that I could talk to or ask and I just really would like advice or someone to talk to or hearing about other people who have gone through similar things but I don't really know where to go. I was pretty much raised christian but I had an incredibly open minded family who basically told me that they are christian, that is what they believe, but I am free to believe whatever I want. I hated church (it was long and boring) and they never made me go, never pushed me to be anything I didn't want to be, never condemned me for believing what I wanted. Religion wasn't a big deal and we didn't talk about it but I guess I just sort of decided I wanted to believe in god anyway. I'm not a practicing christian at all, I probably wouldn't even identify myself as christian if I was asked since I don't really like institutionalized religion but I'd be lying to myself if I said that I didn't pray. I pray all the time, I pray every night and when I'm upset or stressed out I pray. And I feel really lost and ashamed because I pray and by extension still believe in a god on some level. I want to just make the full jump into atheism, it's like one part of me knows that logically there is no magical cosmic being that nobody can see dictating everything around us. It sounds ridiculous and made up. But even knowing that it's like I can't tell myself it isn't real. I'm having a really hard time with it, I don't know how to describe the feeling but I almost feel like someone close to me died. I just feel empty. I don't know where to go for help, I'm afraid to ask people in my life who are christian because I don't want to seem like I am doubting or testing them/their religious convictions and I just know they'll inevitably tell me to ""have faith"" and ask god, have faith have faith have faith, and it makes me want to scream because I don't have any faith left. I want to move on but I don't want to give up god, I guess. I've been on and off sobbing all day, I don't know what to do. THe only way to make myself get over it for short amounts of time is to just push it away and pretend it isn't there but always whenever I have time alone and nothing to distract myself it comes back.

Should I go to a pastor? A councilor? I don't know. It all feels really melodramatic and I am ashamed and embarrassed to admit that it is making me so depressed but I can't even make myself do anything. I wouldn't say I feel suicidal but I just don't know what the point is anymore. I always had prayer to rely on and now I don't know.

I was bullied by the entire school from 7th-10th grade for not fighting, not playing sports, and being a dark-skinned black person (as opposed to light-skinned). I wasn't the only person going through this at that school, but I never got the chance to meet the other afflicted kids. Instead of concentrating on my studies, I had to prepare for what would happen the next day, each day. Whenever I studied instead, I paid dearly for it. I was slapped with baby lotion, insulted by my teachers, had my desk flipped with me in it, etc. Once, I was simply trying to take a piss, and was attacked in the bathroom by a group of five. Got a huge gash on my arm, but it healed up. Standing up for myself didn't work, because, like I said, it was the entire school. No matter what I did verbally or physically, I would be outnumbered (Cowards, I know, but they apparently thought it was ethical). 

Reporting them to the staff didn't help, because they supported their behavior. One of the teachers once started telling one of the students that no one liked him and he would never be anything in life because of it. Everyone just laughed. The teachers were not all that good either. My algebra I teacher let the students teach the class, grade the papers, and put grades in the system. This was a school that was located in a town that valued sports, fighting, etc rather than academics or anything truly worthwhile. They once interrupted an important exam during school hours for a girls' football game that everyone was required to attend. This wasn't a mostly black school either, it was highly diverse. It wasn't in the ghetto or a rural area either, it's just that the people there were just...evil. My parents' responses at first indicated strongly that they didn't believe me when I explained the situation, but one day they decided to tour the school and found out I was right. They flipped shit and pulled me out immediately. 

When I left the school and the area it was in, after seeing and being the victim of so much depravity throughout the town, I read in the newspaper that it was voted #2 place to raise your kids. I threw it away and convinced myself the article wasn't real, and that such an outlandish statement would never have become a general consensus. After moving to where I am now, people are respectful, kind, and basically normal. When I was simply able to walk down the hallway to class without anyone giving me shit, trying to trip me, or anything else, I could hardly believe it. I have made As and high Bs ever since and have gotten into my dream college. I've also gotten to job shadow for NASA. I do admit that it has still been a lot harder for me to trust people now though. I frequently have relapses on what happened and through these periods I feel intense hatred, anger, and sometimes sadness. This can occur at almost any time, at school, at home, etc. I don't really know how to put it behind me, and I recently read that kids who were bullied never truly get past it. I look at people who were never bullied in high school or had trouble at home and can't help but feel jealous.

I can't see a future.,24,7,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/1hfsjz/everything_ive_ever_cared_about_has_been_taken/,"This is a long story and starts a while ago. On a throwaway account because I wouldn't want anyone involved to find or recognise this.

About 16 years ago I was going through a tricky time romantically and personally. I was coming to terms with the fact I had spent my childhood emotionally abused and bullied by my father after my mother left to go explore her lesbian side or whatever and my 'first true love' (god how I hate that term but it's how it felt at the time) had just gone off to uni and predictably things had fallen apart. Looking back I was gripped by a deep depression, but as my depression first tends to manifest as sardonic humour neither I nor anyone I knew really noticed. I was 17.

Enter G. Now G was 29 years old and worked with me. She was divorced and I later discovered already had a child from her previous marriage. She was also very, ahem, experienced and, umm, quick to share that 'experience' with me, if you catch my drift.

It was the perfect storm - I was young, heartbroken and with absolutely no self-esteem and she was older, experienced, confident and not shy to tell me what to do, how to behave, what to wear, etc. I fell infatuated with her almost immediately. My lack of experience with life and relationships meant I didn't recognise the abuse for what it was until years later - until the physical stuff started.

Now, I have to forgive my friends for not realising what was going on - she's 5' and puts on a very convincing 'game face' when she wants people to believe she's a helpless damsel -- I'm 6'1, built **big**, and everyone assumes that means I must be dominant/ 'not afraid of a little woman'. But I was - I spent most of my twenties with this woman and lived with daily terror.

She systematically separated me from all friends, family or any outside voice that could highlight how badly I was treated. She used every form of control you read about - I was not allowed any money, or to spend any of 'our' money. I wasn't allowed to be late home without letting her know first. I couldn't decide *anything* that affected us both or even just me. 

And when I use the term 'not allowed' I don't mean I'd get the silent treatment for a bit or a nasty note on the fridge. I mean I'd have various things thrown at me, or things that were precious to me 'accidentally' broken or lost, or be publically humiliated at the next opportunity. She didn't actually start hitting me properly until very later in the relationship but I'd accumulated so many mental bruises by that point the physical ones barely registered anyway.

Then we had our first child. Quite simply the most amazing day of my life. Our daughter was and remains the most incredible thing to ever happen in my life. For the first time I felt I meant something more than myself. G didn't even bond with her at first so I was doubly lucky in being able to do everything from the night-time feeds to bathing her and everything in between (work schedule be damned).

It also, unfortunately, marked the point she began using our baby's happiness as a weapon against me. I'd begun to become 'numb' to the pain she would inflict upon me, but she could make me do anything by casually neglecting our baby if I didn't do what she said the moment she said it, she'd wait until I was at work and then call with the baby crying in the background and make some comment about how she '*would* feed her but she was too tired at the moment because I didn't do X or Y for her when she asked earlier'. 

I won't list all the ways she did this but with our first, and latterly second child she would use them as pawns like this upon the slightest whim.

Finally, when I was 28 I also faced some very difficult circumstances at work (yes, this was during the 'global financial crisis' years). Ultimately he pressure of having to hyperperform at my job (a very nice one, but high stress) and be constantly bullied and abused at home topped off with discovering from a friend that G had been having multiple affairs for years through a second facebook account caused me to crack and I suffered a full-on nervous breakdown.

Whilst hospitalised I was referred to counselling for the first time in my life and I must say it single-handedly saved my life I think. The counsellor helped me to see the twisted knot of crap I was calling a relationship wasn't 'healthy and normal' but instead very 'unhealthy and abusive'.

It took me about six months, but once day I asked G to take care of the children for ONE evening whilst I went out (she otherwise wouldn't care for them at all citing 'the stress of living with you(me)' as her reason). I came back after two hours to find my 2 year old son asleep on the floor under the table covered in spaghetti having eaten nothing and my daughter sat with a jar of nutella watching unsuitable telly, with G meanwhile shut in her (used to be 'our') bedroom literally phone-fucking some random guy. That was the day I finally told her to feck off and find somewhere else to live.

Now, at the time, she'd just returned to work and I had resigned following the breakdown so I agreed to put my career on hold and take care of the kids full time. Not because I wanted to do G any favours, but because I remembered how much my family splitting up hurt when no one paid us (the kids) any mind, so I wanted my children to know at least ONE parent was willing to dedicate their time to THEIR wellbeing.

Now fast forward to last year. My mother (who left to go be gay) had finally made contact with me after more than 15 years. not the traditional way, of course, no that would be far too boring for my family apparently - nope I heard from her for the first time via a call from the hospital telling me she was in after an overdose of vodka and pills. So off I went to the hospital to find out wtf was going on.

Turns out her partner (female) had been abusing her for the last 15 years. Well, she didn't tell me this, she just told me what her girlfriend would do to her and as I was just going through the whole thing myself I recognised the abuse when she couldn't.

So whilst I was trying to rebuild a very low income life for me and my children (G only saw them alternate weekends and occasionally during the week so she could claim child tax credit and child benefit without having to actually give up time she could be screwing other guys I assume) I was also trying to extricate my mother from a deeply abusive relationship so I didn't wind up getting a call one day saying her next suicide attempt had been successful.

There's a lot that went on during this period but the important thing is that ultimately, without my having to use threats or ultimatums of any kind I finally managed to get my mother to prosecute her abuser. However as the trial was likely to be at least a year away it wasn't over yet. I had to ensure she wouldn't change her mind, which she nearly did several times. Finally she agreed that if me and the kids moved into her house, she would feel more secure. So, given she had the spare rooms and her partner was restricted from coming near any of us by court order I did that.

Unfortunately this is where the wheels start coming off. One of the things my mother had hidden from me was that she had developed alcoholism during her ordeal. Now, I managed to stop my children from ever witnessing her drunk but it was a constant anxiety. What's more it meant I was often spending money I couldn't afford to top up her income as she'd fudge figures in the weekly housekeeping budget to hide her addiction.

Finally the trial came around and we waited with baited breath for a custodial sentence - sure 15 years of sexual, emotional and physical abuse would attract a fitting sentence? Nope - they fined her £200 and awarded THEMSELVES £500 court costs.

I think for me this was the proverbial straw. I'd put my whole life on hold, endured anxiety that would give a three-toed-sloth an ulcer, been calm and played EVERYTHING by the book and the judicial system didn't even think it was worth giving a single night in a cell for our trouble.

I'll admit, I became deeply depressed. I wrote about it on a blog to try to externalise how bad I was feeling and went to the doctor to get referred to counselling again.

Only that didn't work out - because I'd moved to my mother's my old surgery had silently deregistered me, and then it got worse - because my mum's ex-partner was going to force the sale of the jointly-owned home I couldn't be registered with a NEW doctor because I didn't have an address I knew I'd be in 6 months. I was between the proverbial rock and hard place.

On top of all this, my mother had been going to special domestic violence counselling with an organisation called 'RISE' who, unbeknownst to her, had been reporting to social services every single time my mother told them I was feeling down with 'concerns over my mental health' without telling her.

Now we come to February - I knew the house had to be sold so was looking for somewhere for me and the kids to move (truth be told I was looking forward to not having to be a parent to my own parent as well as my children) and suddenly my mum tells me the contracts are being exchanged in a fortnight. Turns out she'd privately sold the house and not told me 'to protect me'. Of course it had the exact opposite effect, I suddenly had 14 days to find another property, get referenced, pay the deposit and move me and the kids in.

Literally whilst I am reeling from this I get a knock at the door and it's the social workers.

Now I had never had a problem with social workers - in fact I'd asked them to check on my ex once before when the children had told me she'd reverted to her neglectful ways on the days they were there after her moving out. However these social workers were different.

For a start they wouldn't tell me why they'd come. In fact on three different occasions they told me three different reasons. None of those reasons turned out to be honest.

Next they were asking some strange questions about domestic abuse, something I explained had been dealt with BEFORE I'd let me and the children move in here.

In essence I sleepwalked into a trap set by my ex-wife and her new rich boyfriend.

Now I don't really want to go into all the grisly details but it transpired G wanted to move ~150 miles away to live with her new boyfriend and give up work. The only way she could do this was to accuse ME of being the domestic abuser, which she apparently did to social services.

Long story short they took my children away from me based upon the word of a serial adulturer, neglectful parent and abusive partner. I am having to go through a 6-12 month assessment to prove that I'm not a nutjob, all the while only being able to see my children *supervised* for an hour every couple of weeks.

On top of this, she refused to return the children and sent me the email from her solicitor on the DAY I was due to sign the letting agreement for the place I had miraculously found for me and the kids, leaving me homeless as well as childless.

Since then, my life has been one long exercise in misery. I've had to learn that social workers don't give a shit about getting to the truth, they just care about 'clearing the case'. So a large-built tall guy, to them, MUST be the abuser in a relationship. In their reports for the court they have repeatedly completely omitted any of the many positive things reported to them by people actually involved in my life, all of whom were very open and forthcoming about how good I was at being a single father, and have presented G's lies as 'the most likely scenario'.

Within a month of my being put in this position she then moved her and the children 150 miles away, and because I am 'under investigation' I could do NOTHING to stop her.

So my poor children, who are quoted as saying 'nothing' when asked what was bad about living at daddy's house, are now shipped half-way across the country to live with a serial abuser, liar and neglectful mother. I'm crying just thinking about how confused they must be about the whole thing.

Meanwhile I am forced to live in a hostel, with a 4 year gap in my employment record, looking for a job and a room in a house because the cretinous government decided people under 35 no longer deserve their own flat. Yeah, finding someone who wants to share a house with a 33 year old father of two is a fucking BREEZE (not).

I'm slowly having to sell all my possessions as I run out of places to store them. Literally everything I ever had and cared about has been taken, and I don't know why I'm carrying on any more.

I can't seem to wrap my mind around it, any of it. How it can happen. How can so much weight be put on the word of such a manipulative liar? How can I be forced to break my solemn promise to my children to protect them from their mother when she can manufacture a fait accomplis through the law like this??

I only cope at the moment by putting it all out of my mind as much as possible. But then I see something that reminds me of my kids and it's like I pulled a plaster off an open wound. I mean I literally crumple like so much waste paper and can barely hold my own body up with the weight of the injustice my kids are going to have to call their life.

I just don't know what to do.

Sorry for the long post, but I needed to talk to *someone*, and given I now know I can't even trust counsellors, and I don't want to burden my friends with all of this in case they get tired of my shit and stop calling me or taking my calls, I figured reddit was my final option.

How do I get back up from this? What's the point when everything just gets taken away? I just want my children back, but if that's not possible then I'd settle for just being able to enjoy things again because right now nothing, not my favourite ice cream or even sex is anything more to me than just 'meh' and it's been this way so long I've forgotten how it feels to smile without forcing it (I wish I was joking).

I haven't managed to meet anyone, I don't really know how to. meetup.com has virtually nothing on there for this area.

It's a smallish town in a remote part of England. This would not be my first choice of place to live. In fact, I have been wanting to move to London for years. Though any big city would have been good. I grew up in a town in the countryside, and I really didn't want to go back to another (even smaller) place. I studied in Bristol, and I enjoyed it there.

Just as luck would fucking have it, I'm offered a job literally on the other side of the country to London, and about 180 miles from Bristol. I can see that it's a beautiful place to live, but I'm bored. I have very low confidence and self-esteem. It's near impossible for me to just go out and meet people. I thought I would be able to find people through music (I'm a flautist), but the fact is that most classical musicians seem to be of a different generation. So unless I want my circle of friends to be people in their 60s, it's not a good way to find others. I really am terrible at making friends. Life is always very lonely for me, and I've only ever had one relationship in my life, 6 years ago, and it was brief. The only really close friends I ever had were in high school, but I don't live near them anymore, nor do I have much contact with them (incidentally, most of them live in London now, another good reason for me to want to move there - at least then I'd know some people).

I live alone in a flat, a choice I'm wondering if was such a good one. Unfortunately, my (somewhat rushed) search for shared houses only found places with students, not ideal for someone who works 9-5:30, since I need peace in the evenings. Plus, I wanted to avoid all the drama that seems to come with student accomodation.

So I'm sitting here on my computer over this bank holiday weekend, feeling fucking miserable, fantasising about suicide and wanting to leave this place after only 3 weeks here. I cannot wait until my work contract ends, so I can go. Unfortunately, I have another 11 months before that happens.

Thank you everyone for your responses I am a bit better today. I got encouragement from you and a friend that helped me put some stuff in perspective.

",24,6,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/1b2rtr/i_lost_the_majority_of_my_friends_in_one_big/,"I've never been so fucking depressed. There, I said it. I think I've been trying to lie to myself for the past three months that ""Hey, maybe it's not so bad. Just chin up, it'll get better soon."" Meanwhile I'm crying on a semi-daily basis. The fuck?  

Tl;dr of what happened: my flatmate and I got in a really big fight. We talked, came to a compromise, and I even asked her multiple times ""Are you sure you're alright with this compromise? Because the point of a compromise is that both sides are happy, and if you aren't, we can make a new one"" to which she always said ""I'm fine"". Turns out, she wasn't fine. She treated me like shit in the most passive aggressive way ever, absolutely burnt the bridge of our friendship for-fucking-ever, and now I can't even be in the same room with her without feeling a lot of anger and resentment and hurt.  

Which means I can't hang out with our mutual friends because they refuse to 'pick a side' which I get and wouldn't pressure them to do, but as I said, I can't be in the same room as this chick. Everything she does just pisses me off to no end now. So I rarely hang out with my friends anymore.  

We're also still flatmates until our lease ends, so I'm pretty much a hermit. I feel like a recluse in my own goddamn apartment. We have a 3rd flatmate who I used to be really close to, but now she and the bitch are best friends so, whatever.  

I have a boyfriend but he's on the other side of the country right now for school. He's also really busy all the time, so I feel like if I pester him for the attention/human interaction I so desperately crave, it comes off as clingy. He knows I'm upset but has no idea it's this bad. I don't want to scare him away with it either.  

I've made efforts to get outside and meet people and make friends, but all I've accomplished are making a lot of goddamn acquaintances. Everyone in college already has friends. Cliques and stuff. No one's in need of an entire new set of friends like me.  

Lately it's been getting harder and harder to even try. I barely leave my room anymore, with the exception of going to class. And recently, I've been skipping all my classes. I've gone multiple days without even changing out of my pajamas.  

I'm spiraling further and further into whatever the fuck is my problem right now and I don't really have the energy anymore to try to pull myself out of it. I feel like I've tried and nothing's amounted from it. And when I see my bitch of a roommate out making new friends or growing closer to the ones I used to be close with.. it's just not right.

1363656342.0,17,self.MMFB,1akbqh,I reported my co-worker to our Sergeant for inappropriate behavior.,17,0,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/1akbqh/i_reported_my_coworker_to_our_sergeant_for/,"I started a law enforcement related job a few months ago where I work in a small team of 3-4 technicians.

I'm not sure where to begin. Two of the techs used to date. They had a messy relationship and a messy break-up. Being a young woman and the fact that the female half of this doomed duo has severe jealousy, anxiety, and anger issues, the officers we work with and admin workers kept saying they were afraid for me. I shrugged this off, as she (let's call her Mindy) was great to me in the beginning. Very helpful and nice. The male half (let's call him Bruce) was also very professional and nice at first.

Allow me to recap a brief timeline:

Bruce invites me out to happy hour with friends and wants to keep it hush hush at work. I honor the request as I like to keep up boundaries between work and personal life up, too. Big mistake, as one night Bruce spends the time trying to feed me shots, hits on me, gropes me, and tries to hook up with me. I tell him no by any means, that I only wanted to be friends and most certainly only wanted to have a strictly professional relationship from then on. Awkward, but I let it go because a) he kept it outside of work and b) he was a bit sadly drunk and pathetic about it, so I felt bad for him.

Flash forward and I slowly become friendly with Mindy, though it becomes stressful because I realize she's a bit of a time bomb. I have caught the tail end of her yelling at Bruce at work for seemingly random reasons, which he never reports and I have been advised that I can't report as I am not the victim of this.

Our lead technician leaves for another position. After which, I start to realize he's been a buffer between me and the worst of their interactions as well as the one balancing the work load between all of us.

I start to take on more and more cases. At first, it felt like a good thing, as I am new and eager. But slowly Bruce and Mindy's attitude towards me shifts to assigning me tasks, usually ones they'd rather not do.

So under this atmosphere, I work overtime for the 4th weekend in a row, taking extra time to mistakenly keep the peace between them as neither wanted the time. I get into work this morning and there is another case to take on. Unilaterally, they both separately tell our supervisors that I will take the case. I do the case, pissed off but I take it, and then after getting back into work I ask them for a word.

I say, upset of course but even-tempered and brief, that I don't mind taking on cases, but that I would appreciate being asked first. That's all. (Note that we are all in the same position - equals - this is important)

Mindy blows up. She raises her voice at me and yells, both to me and Bruce, that I am ""in training"" and that she was in the right to give me the case. I note my exhaustion and that I took the overtime, she states that it was easy overtime and that I was getting paid for it. Bruce walks out of the room. I attempt to disengage because she is yelling and obviously does not want to be reasoned with. She keeps yelling, stating that we take turns with casework and that we're all equals (my thoughts: then me taking 4/5 cases in 2 days is ""taking turns""? On top of two projects and the work the lead tech was responsible for before he left?). I state that we don't have to fight about it, that I only asked to be asked. She yells that we're not fighting (oh boy) and that I'm pissed because I didn't want to do the unpleasant work. I admit that I was pissed, but that it wasn't about the nature of the work. She tells me that I'm lying and ""Admit it. Admit it. You came in here pissed. Let's talk about this like adults."" (Note that I am half her age, so now that it is hours later I do wonder if this was said as a power move due to my age) I say ok, let's talk. She rolls her eyes, rants, yells that the system in place is to take turns and I need experience. I tell her that I understand her point of view, but by this point I realize it's a lost cause. She angrily states that she has been good to me, I agree to stop her yelling.

Flash forward, admin in the office see that I'm visibly upset. They assume what happened, and I'm surprised at first that they could guess. Apparently, Mindy has a history of putting work on and bullying anyone female from work that hangs out with Bruce. She doesn't know about Bruce hitting on me, but she knows that we were both at the St. Patrick's Day work happy hour. Apparently, she's been written up several times for physically and verbally threatening other female co-workers. I was urged to report the yelling.

And so here we are. I reported it, fairly and without embellishment imho, to the sergeant. On top of that the issue that I had casework thrown on me by both of them without input.

Tl;dr the lessons learned: Confront co-workers with a supervisor present. I may have been trying to handle it on my own without getting anyone into trouble, but that's what the higher ups get paid for.

My ex girlfriend of almost four years broke up with me almost three weeks ago. For the past few months we had serious convictions of tying the knot her later years in college. I set up a savings account for the ring and the wedding. I figured that with us getting married and wanting to have kids I was going to need a stable source of income. I was looking at some culinary schools and striving to become a chef and fulfill a old childhood dream. I was beginning to set course for our future together. 
      The day she broke up with me, she came over to my place and told me I should start attending church again. She was on her way to church that very evening and I suggested that I attend with her and we could go together for a few months and see how it works out. After some discussing we sorted out that she wanted to go on my own accord and because I believed and not to merely please her. I told her that there would be no reasonable likely hood of that ever happening and that pretty much sealed my fate. 
 Just to give some context, I was and indoctrinated in Catholicism. I was a pretty devout one till about my high school years, at least for a short while, and we first met our freshman year. I had broken up with her before during high school because I actually had serious considerations to join the priesthood or becoming a monk. Ironically, it was actually my time off during spring break my senior year that I spent on a retreat in a monastery that actually lead to the end of my faith. 
       Fast forwarding to the present, I have since spent a great deal of my time when I'm not working studying the basics of philosophy, modern logic, ethics, and subjects of related natures. Needless to say that my pursuit of these schools of thought has only furthered my skepticism of any flavor of religious faith. While, I am not a fan of the term, I am an atheist. I told this to my girlfriend who a few months ago joined what would seem like a Christian fundamentalist sorority, as expected she was not delighted to hear this. Months went on and every now and then we would discuss this invidious gulf between us in terms of beliefs, that never ended well. Eventually it lead to her breaking up with me. If I'm at fault, I am completely blind to what I did wrong. 
     But anyways, now that she has broken up with me, I have been completely released of all burden of responsibilities that I mentioned toward the beginning of this post. I now have no idea what to do. These past few weeks I've just been working and sleeping. My studies have become bland. My hobbies have lost their taste. I don't know what to do for the future, I completely planned my life around us being together. I feel lost at sea, my compass has been shattered and  the stability of my mental health has taken quite a shift. I'm beginning to build myself up again slowly but it's painful and my mind is limping by.

While this is a process that I'm still trying to figure out, I just wanted to ask for any of you guys/girls who have been in a situation much like mine; how you got over it, what you did, etc. While there is no one right answer and advice is just that, advice. I feel like sharing in some experiences and exchanging words with you guys will help me along my path.

I solute the people who couldn't get the right help on time. I mourn for them, because at least for some of them, those awful terrible feelings would have improved and disappeared again, if there had been enough time. 

You out there, please try hard to not give up. Please try to find the right help. Have my virtual hug... ",,False,,t5_2sjdn,False,,,True,t3_17moc1,http://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/17moc1/i_feel_much_better/,

I am exited by genuine, mortal agony, I have compulsions to hurt people every single day sense before i can remember.

it's like a drug, it's better than drugs. 

I close my eyes and all i see is choking up blood and busted lungs and splintering bones and it just feels *so good.*

I've been this way since before I can remember(the first time i can remember it i was four), and nothing I do seems to change it. I'm 23 years old and have never had a sexual partner. I'm friendly and outgoing to everyone, have tons of friends, a 3.9 GPA and every night I fall asleep to fantasies about murder. Nobody knows, not a single soul. It gets really lonely.

i control myself because i have to, but when i'm walking down the street my mind just goes wild, splitting skulls, knife wounds, blood and pain is all that fills my head.

I'm afraid to go to therapy because I don't want to be labeled as a threat (also i can't afford it). But that's a lie, i am a threat, because when I lose my temper (very rarely) I completely lose control. all of my carefully erected psychological architecture comes crashing down and all i want is to inflict pain. i've killed animals, when i was younger, i'm ashamed to say i enjoyed it.

 I decided when i was very young that if it ever came down to a choice between my life and someone else's i would take my own. i'm not suicidal, i'm not really angry or depressed as some people suggest. i'm usually pretty happy, except the inside of my head is an abattoir. 

 I'm not a sociopath, I feel everything, some dislocated sense of empathy keeps me in check, at the same time my emotions are slowly killing me, because i know what i am and i know that i can't stop.

(my friend's name) hey!
&gt;
I was looking through my old emails and then saw that I never replied back to your emails. I'm so sorry :'( 
&gt;
Ok so this is going to be a very long venting session. Like the one we had in French class all the time. oh 6th grade. I haven't taken French ever since so I've never actually had the chance to vent since then haha.
&gt;
So anyway I miss you and everyone at (my school name) soso much. I have friends in Japan of course but they never quite live up to you guys. As in, they're all really shallow and obsessed with being an ""artsy hipster"" which is great but isn't worth sacrificing everything else for. Basically they're all so superficial. And I guess I sound horrible right now and probably even just as judgemental and patronizing as they are about people who don't fit into the definition of ""hipster"" (I escaped that doom because I own a polaroid haha), but honestly can i just have one introspective conversation with them without one person declaring proudly that theyve cut herself in the past and/or making a miserably failed attempt at trying to be deep such as but not limited to ""i'm so scared that people don't like me."" sigh. obviously there are going to be a handful of people who dont hold a favorable opinion of you, and a few more too if you're that sort of person who's easy to dislike. no offense or anything, because most of them are all really nice. they're just...empty and willing to mindlessly believe the ideals (indie, hipster, ""depression,"" awkward moments, one direction...the list could go on) that society forces upon them. ugh i guess i sound so full of myself right now and i hope you don't think i think i'm perfectly thoughtful and have mastered the complications of life. because i haven't. i'm just as imperfect a person as i could ever think of, and i'm simply looking for people who could share that thought and strive towards improvement. these people around me haven't even realized that they have their faults as well, and if they have, they embrace it and make no efforts to change for the better because they hold a certain pride for not fitting into social norms and being inconventional/rebellious and take that pride as evidence that they are completely at ease with themselves when really all they are doing is hiding behind their own insecurity. i really hate the emphasis popular culture and the media (cough tumblr cough) place on us to become unique, because it gives people an excuse to run away from ""conventions"" because to them it's an enemy to personal individuality; what they don't realize is that conventions are essential and helpful in defining your own place in the world, because once you think about it, every aspect of life is built on those conventions and to abandon them would be impossible.
&gt;
anyway. phew. that was a lot. if only i could write that fast when writing essays. minus the many runon sentences i probably made. this isn't my typical school writing. i hope you followed my train of thought, and if not i'm sorry. i really am.
&gt;
have you read the perks of being a wallflower? if you haven't you really should. it's probably one of the best books i've ever read and consists of a series of letters that a character named charlie sends to a stranger as a way of self-reflection. you're not a stranger but i'm sort of aiming for that with this email - pure, unfiltered self contemplation, whether it holds me in a favorable light or an unfavorable one. i guess that's one of the pros of moving away from some of your close friends. you know they're amazing people with passions and doubts and values who will judge you fairly by your character, but you have no obligation to say what they would like to hear because you're never in actual contact with them. as in, they can't exactly influence your physical life. there's only the fact of their existence and the assurance that they have read your letters. no fake emotions or coverups. i hope that made sense. i don't exactly know how to describe it. but it represents an opportunity for candid self-judgement of the human i am at the moment, which i'm in desperate need of right now. 
&gt;
i'm sorry this email seems to be taking forever. i swear i'll be done soon. all i need from you is that you read my words, whether you understand it or not. or pretend to have read them. just make it believable. 
&gt;
anyway the reason i started to write this letter in the first place is that i'm working on my boarding school essays now. well, barely - i've only read the prompts and wrote down a few notes here and there. anyway, reading the prompts - lessons that i've learned, a semi-autobiography, what i want to see in society, etc - i noticed that i don't have a very strong sense of self. the character is definitely there and i have firm values. i just don't know how to define them into intelligible terms for my brain or the admission officers to understand. which is very strange, but i think i know why. i don't mean to bring up the subject and it's high time i've moved on, but basically every aspect of my life now comes down to that decisive month of february 2010, and i'm afraid this one does too. do you remember what happened then? i don't. i've trained myself to be in firm denial of the events that may have happened and my heart has repeatedly refused my brain's right to even acknowledge the events. over time i've managed to build a virtual barrier around that line of events within my thoughts, one that probably takes a lot of effort to cross. i wouldn't know - i've never allowed myself to even try going over that border. i know the skeletons of the occurrences, but for about 9 months now i've been in absolute rebuttal. anyway, this is why i can't define my character. because my character roots from the events, and anything that is even related to the events  is now isolated within that wall, and to access it would cause tremendous stress on my mental stability. oh god. mental stability. i did not just write that. because i like to think of myself as a perfectly sane person in control of my feelings and thoughts. as demonstrated in my building of the wall. i'm not going back to the wreck i was. ever. 
&gt;
but lately that's becoming a difficulty. it really is. i guess this is part of growing up: the urge to become more sure of oneself. to stop pretending and know what makes me who i am. and this boarding school essay totally presents that opportunity to come in terms with who i really am, and although my 12 year old self would've cleverly worked out a way to shield my inner self and carve out a whole another story of a total stranger, my 14 year old self finds it hard to abandon this ideal moment. i want to know who i am. but the wall is huge. and i'm afraid that if i go in again, i'll unleash the monster that i was in the past.
&gt;
but even when contained, the monster defines me and taunts me and sometimes takes over me. like an emotional flashback, i guess. one moment i let my thoughts loose and they begin to wander and let their guard down and this tremendous unexplainable wave of emotion and fear and paranoia and guilt comes crashing down on me and suddenly i hate myself and i'm swimming - ha jokes i can't swim - being washed away in a mass of liquid vacuum. sorry that doesn't make sense but it's exactly how it feels like. i'm drifting whichever way the tide is washing me to but there is nothing there when i try to grasp any little substance that might be there and nothing for me to take a deep breath of and calm down. and then that goes away and i'm see the world through rose tinted glasses again and all is well and i love people and i am thankful for my family friends myself grades teachers and food.
&gt;
so basically the monster defines me. and the monster defines my character. and i cannot finish these boarding school application essays without finding my character, which i can't do without encountering the other machine-like creature within my brain.
&gt;
i guess it's sort of amusing that considering those circumstances, i still try to convince myself that i'm mentally stable. hah. i am though. so many people have it worse than me. there'e only one kind of people that i truly hate in this world and its the people who try to play victim. and whatever i do, i'm not going to be one of those people. so yes i'm mentally stable. i happen to be very good at fooling myself into believing something when in actuality it's contrary to reality. i am perfectly stable. i really am. i am. i can't be anything else. i won't let myself be anything else. even if i have to pretend to be stable, that's better than facing the reality of my frame of mind.
&gt;
except for this time. i cannot pretend to be someone else in the boarding school essays. my conscience won't allow me. but the thing is, the reality is horrible. devastating. i am actually one of the most awful, disgustingly terrible people that i could ever think of. and unlike what you and the others have been trying to convince me, it's my fault. 
&gt;
meanwhile i'm actually having a pretty good life which i feel horrible about because i can think of so many people who deserve it a lot more than i do. i won an award for my app which was released on the app store in october and have 18000 downlaods. and that's japan alone. i've been featured on various media for that because it;s unusual for a girl/woman to be interested in technology in japan let alone an 8th grader. yay? i got a new camera for my birthday have an iphone 5 and got a macbook pro retina. i have nice friends with amazing outfits (ha, superficial. but i never said i didn't like good clothes. miss urban outfitters &lt;/3) and my ssat scores were great. my neighbor got a new puppy and since i babysit their daughter i get to play with her. i had penne for dinner today which was amazing and i'm having a sleepover with 2 of my friends tomorrow. oh god now i'm just procrastinating. i'm debating whether i should press the send button or not. speaking of which, google just updated their interface. i haven't exactly made up my mind about it but the send button is now located at the bottom (instead of at the top) and as i'm typing the blue of the send button is glaring at my eyes. i didn't mean for the email to be so long and i'm pretty sure its incoherent and so full of runon sentences and fragments and blah. i'm sorry. usually i would go over my email but since this one is so long (1727 words last i checked... hah this is just as long as my term paper wow) and its pretty late in the evening i think i'll just leave it and hope you don't get too frustrated. anyway you don't have to reply to this. i don't expect you to go out of your way to try to make me feel better because writing this letter has already served that purpose. i feel like some weight has been lifted off my shoulders and although theres a lot more to be cleared, it's a start. again, all i need is the reassurance that a good person is reading this email. i can't really explain. 
&gt;
please read the perks of being the wallflower if you haven't. it moved me and i swear it will move you too. i trust that it will move you. because you're a human albeit a good one. and then you'll get a pretty good understanding of where my thoughts are coming from and maybe you will reread this email after youre done with it and have some sort of sympathy that may have been inexistent before. in case you don't have the time, i've attached a screenshot of one of the most moving paragraphs in the book. 
&gt;
i would like to say that this would be the last venting email i would write to you but i can't promise anything.

The classes at my school have these interactive whiteboards and the students got a hold of the remote when I wasn't looking. They kept freezing the image whenever I'd try to write and they had a ball getting me to try it again, even after I just assumed it wasn't working and tried to move on.

Didn't even get to see 21. Fucking heart attack. There are tons of people who mix drugs everyday, he does it one time and boom! it kills him. It's not fair. 
   My mother has started drinking more. She's actually drunk right now. Instead of once a week it's every other night. I tried to talk to her but she won't acknowledge it. She gets mad at me when I say something and goes on about how she isn't an alcoholic. She's tried to kill herself in the past over some girl and I don't think she ever really got over her, plus a dead child...I'm sure that's not helping any...I want her to be okay but it's hard when she won't listen. 
   My father keeps making broken promises. ""Oh, I'm coming to see you soon!"", ""I'm going to start talking to you more."", etc., etc. After 20 years of this I have come to realize it's just a lie. But it doesn't make it hurt any less. My father is a cool person in general but, he's a terrible father. I always thought I was doing just fine without him...but I want a dad. 
   I'm in still in love with my best friend/ex. He's all I have. He's pretty much the only friend I have left. I can't get over him. I'm so scared of losing him. But tonight though...I was trying to talk to him about my brother...and he just...slowly made his way towards the door, trying to leave. After I sat there and helped him talk about some of his problems, he tried to leave when I needed him! But I can't stay mad at him. I still love him to much. 
   I hate being alone, so I guess that's why I won't/can't let go of my ex. I'm alone right now and I feel so...cold, empty,...dead. Non of my friend will listen to me anymore. No matter how big my problem is, theirs is somehow worse.

I had a very happy childhood, up until the time I was 11. Later, I was made privy to the information my father was an alcoholic, etc., and the family wasn't as awesome as I thought. Anyway, I had a crippling fear of the dark, and to help me get over it, my dad said he'd sleep on the floor in my room. Guess where that went? For the next four years, he molested me. (I fucking hate that word, I hate it, I hate it, I hate it.) 

Over the course of these years, these things happened: I had a really bad case of anorexia, and had to go to treatment when I was thirteen. I ran away twice and tried to kill myself. I self harmed, rather pitifully, and all through this, my poor mother and older brother had no idea why I was acting out so much.

When I was fifteen, I finally told a friend what was happening. She told a counselor at school, and I got taken to foster care. No one, not my mother, not my brother, no fucking single person believed me. I lived in foster care for a few months with a wonderful family, but then I got sent to another home which was very abusive. She was intensely religious and hated me. She yelled at me constantly and said that I was fat, lazy, all of it. She said I was evil for liking Harry goddamned Potter. 

I got sent back to live with my mother, who eventually decided she believe me after I consented to take a fucking lie detector test. I had to take a lie detector test, and I was the one who got raped for four years. 

By this time I was sixteen. My mother and I went to live with my grandmother, and things slowly got kind of better. I couldn't sleep, though. Hardly ever. I had terrible nightmares and had to go to therapy for PTSD treatment. I had finally had enough, and when I was almost seventeen, my mom pulled me off the roof when I was trying to jump off. I went to the hospital for psychiatric care (for the fucking fourth time,) and got sort of better. 

Now I'm alright, ish. I'm almost eighteen, I have good grades, and my life is okay. But. I'm just so sad. The relationships I have with my family are so tainted. My family doesn't want to believe me, because it hurts. I don't know if I can ever fully forgive them. I just need someone to make me feel better.

TL;DR: I was molested for four years and the disbelief from my family has affected me profoundly. ",,False,,t5_2sjdn,False,,,True,t3_yd606,http://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/yd606/after_i_revealed_my_abuse_my_family_didnt_believe/,

It's a rare epileptic disorder, and can be potentially catastrophic (read: he could lose all skills/development and/or brain function) if not treated.  We spent a week in the hospital, and with every seizure, he could potentially be having more brain damage.  

It's heartbreaking to watch, and we have to give him a shot every day plus additional medicines twice a day that he absolutely fights.  The struggle to get medicine down his throat or in his thigh is so stressful that I cry daily.  I hate to force him down, but if he doesn't get enough meds, he could have major seizures.  (The one lucky bit is that he hasn't totally backslid on development for now, and if you were to just meet him, you wouldn't think anything was wrong unless you witnessed a seizure.)

On top of this, I just started a new job, which comes with all the added stress of newness plus leaving my baby at home with a nanny for the first time [since the meds make him immune suppressed, we cannot put him in group care].  I've never felt so guilty walking out the door, and worry every minute the nanny isn't watching him as closely as I would.

To top it off, we just got the FIRST medical bill (of infinity more) and ONE of his FOUR medicines cost 3x my annual salary.  It nearly equals our total mortgage.  We have medical insurance, but not sure yet if we'll be fully covered for all of these things.  Even if they pay 80% of it, I don't know how we'll do it...only time will tell what will be covered.

I'm so worried for my baby and so stressed about the short and long-term for all of us.  Someone just make me feel an eensy bit better, please and thanks.

I have a hard time every day just to get up and keep going, the only reason I am alive today is because of my wife and son.

When I was injured I did not receive any compensation or help with my medical bills, just told to turn in my gear and that there isn't any positions that i can take with the county even with a pay cut.

 I am not supposed to lift anything over 25 pounds but my neurologist knows that my son is 40lbs and I will never give up holding my child but I have to take special precautions when I am carrying him like a back brace and have him stand on a chair for me to pick him up. He is only three years old and I cannot just ignore his want for his daddy to hold him. My Neurologist just advised me to do this only occasionally and it will be okay. 

I returned to college after my injury and finished my AA degree in social work and I am applying to start my BS degree in Criminal Forensics.

Currently I am Unemployed but I apply for 20+ jobs a day because i cannot just not work, i hate to be unemployed and it doesn't matter what job it is that if I can get a career that does not involve heavy lifting I will take it in a heartbeat.

My neurosurgeon cried when he saw my MRI scans because I will never be the same. He offered to do the Spinal Fusion but after further talking to him that with spinal fusion you have to go back every 5 to 10 years and get the vertebrae above and below the fusion fused and eventually I would have my entire spine fused and I would be extremely restricted and possibly in a wheelchair. So we decided to not do the fusion, I have been looking at the pro-disc disc replacement but it is too dangerous of a surgery currently for me to opt in.

I have been through allot and never asked for anything in return I just need advice as to how to make my life easier. I am in constant pain because of my injury and I know that narcotics will stop that but after being in the medical field I also know how highly addictive they are. I occasionally take a Oxycodone maybe once a week but I avoid them as much as possible. Because when I am on Oxycodone although I do not feel the pain I have a hard time stopping myself from going and doing hard work outside at my farm. Then i just wake up crying and screaming because I overworked myself and it ends up making my situation worse.

So currently when i take a narcotic i have my wife stay with me the entire time as to make sure i do not do any heavy lifting or bending at all because I have the Drive to be active and I long to just go do physical work like before i was injured.

I spent Six months in a wheelchair, and two months of being paralyzed when I laid down to go to sleep because my L4 and L5 vertebrae pinched my sciatic nerve when I laid down but when I sat up i had severe pins and needles from my waist down from the feeling coming back to my lower body.

I have had Five MRI's, Three CAT scans, Three steroid injections, Two lumbar punctures, and three months of physical therapy. 

I am 22 years old and that is my story.

Well to start off I am only 16 so I never got close with my brother, but I worked for him in his bussiness and he is moving and selling the bussiness to his assistant. So he is training me to do the bussiness, but he will move far out of state in a few weeks but, but I have to see him tomorrow and I don't know what to do. BTW this is the first time he has done this to me, he has done it to my mom, kids at my church, my dad, and several other members of my family and most male friends he has.

Well here is the story.....

It all started at the field that me and my brother and my youth group play ultimate frisbee at. We had asked someone to grab some drinks from the quickstop near the field. The person who was getting the drinks drove up and the person with the frisbee held it and kept walking with it, no one said anything. (some people still wanted to play) Then he dropped it in the road, I picked up the frisbee and kept walking. Then my brother yelled, ""Jesse, you better drop that frisbee, or I'll tackle you"" ( my name is Jesse) Now my brother normally just jokes about things like that, so jokingly back I just chucked the frisbee somewhere randomly in the field and walked over to get my Gatorade. And the my brother told me to pick it up, I just thought that I was going to get my drink and then get the frisbee. My brother got louder so I decided to get the disk first before he got mad, then someone else started to walking over to get the disk, and I thought my brother saw the guy getting the frisbee. So I just turned around to get my drink and I hear someone running at me, and then someone grabs my hair and the back of my neck. It was my brother, he yells at me ""go get the frisbee!"" I eventually get free from him and hold my ground. He pushes me and says ""if you ever try to act cool in front of your friends again I'm going to knock you out!"" I say ""I wasn't trying to act cool I was just messing around with you and James was going to get the frisbee anyway!"" And then he screams something else that I couldn't even understand and walks away. I walk right behind him to go get the frisbee because I didn't realize it was that big of a deal. He turns around and pushes me and asks why I am walking behind him, I say to get the frisbee and say I am sorry, he then pushes me and grabs my shirt and says ""if you ever try to pull that bullshit on me again and try running up on me, I will smash you"" I just say ""I didn't run at you or even think of trying to hurt you, let me go!"" He pushes me and I grab my wallet and phone and drive home. Then I tell my mom about it and she just explained that I just have to be careful of his anger problems. And just want to point out the fact that there were 3 adults one 19 one 20 and one 25, NO ONE STOPPED THE ARGUEMENT! Also he threated to hit one of the other adults before a few months ago.

So that was what happened tonight and I am just really upset and I cried when I told my mom about this (and I never cry) because all I ever try to do is empress my brother and make him happy and he was my hero. He apparently doesn't give two shits about my feelings, so reddit make me feel better or give me advice. I am just fucking lost with this whole ordeal.

I am terrified, MMFB.",22,5,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/x2t9f/about_to_become_homeless_female_in_the_next_2/,"Well, I knew it would eventually happen. I'm going to be homeless in the next 2 weeks. Here's the quick and dirty version of the story:

I used to work for a bank, then they laid me off, I scrambled to find a job (any job), I asked for assistance via my friends, got it. Found a job at a restaurant, I made just barely enough money to live, I had a roommate for a while. Everything was going well until they left to move back in with their parents. Leaving me to make rent and utilities on my own. I had been asking for more cash assistance from my friends, and they helped me. (even though I hate asking for financial help.) Then, I got a hit with my new job, who **promised** me that if I open up my availability more, that I would get 30-40 hours a week, which is more than enough to pay for my 550/mo rent, and really cheap utilities. I even took a pay cut because they had promised me and said it was a guarantee. 

Now, after 4 weeks, I've only been getting ~10 hours every week, if that. I'm so angry that I left my other job, I couldn't get it back even if I begged. I've desperately have been looking for other jobs but to no avail for whatever reason. I just feel like I keep trying and trying and trying but nothing ever helps. I have tapped out even my parents for cash and they will not let me come live with them. The only financial assistance that I have found was the 30 bucks I made while busking over the weekend (I do living statue work, but the town I live in is very tiny.) the maybe 100 bucks I will get from my job next week, and my forever amazing, lovely, wonderful boyfriend who got a bonus this week at his job and can swing 200 bucks my way. I still need to come up with about 250 before the 1st. All of my friends wish they could do more, but can't. I'm not angry with any of them, I am thankful that they were and continue to be there for me during this time, I do have some great friends. This is nobody's fault but mine, and I'm not upset at anyone except myself.

This wouldn't be the first time I was homeless (I did a 3 week stint while I was in college, and most of that was couch surfing.) I'm 23 and female, I am afraid to live out of my car. I feel like it's vastly different for females to be homeless than males because of all those fears of sexual abuse and rape. Being tinier doesn't really help things either, I could possibly get taken advantaged of very quickly. My friends are concerned about my well being, but I try to toss it off as me being okay, and driven to figure out what I need to get in order before I finally get kicked out. I really haven't even cried about it in front of anyone, but when I'm alone I keep having suicidal thoughts and cannot stop uncontrollably sobbing right before I go to bed. I am scared Reddit.

Please MMFB...",19,1,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/w9dwr/a_year_ago_today_i_was_raped_by_a_guy_who_was_in/,"I'm sorry this is such a long post, but there is background required to understand it.

My stories starts about 5 years ago at bible camp, of all places. The camp I was at hired councillors from the local high schools, because they were encouraged to create and maintain friendships with the campers, especially with the 12, 13 &amp; 14 year olds, who were approaching high school. This included Facebook adds, invitations to hang out with friends, etc. Pretty much, campers who imprinted on councillors, could look up to them, and get help and guidence when needed. 

I met him when I was 12. I'll call him Marmite. (It was his camp name; he wasn't there for many sessions, so even fellow coucillors don't really remember him.) He was up during my session, but I never had him as a councillor, or imprinted on him, but I did have him on Facebook. 

A couple years later Marmite enthusiastically messages me, telling me how much he loves and misses me. I naturally assumed he meant to click on his girlfriend, and missed. We talked a couple times, and a week later it stopped.

Jump again to the end of January, 2011. Marmite lives about an hour away, but his little brother was going to my high school, and played on our hockey team. As per usual, we were kicking ass, so Marmite decides he's going to come down and watch. Shortly before he leaves, he messages me, asking if I want to come too. I tell him sure, I'll come over after exam review for science. (The arena is a cross the street from my high school's science labs.) 

We watch hockey, talk awkwardly, and eventually warm up to each other. He offers to drive me home after the game. He gets to my place, and before I know it, we're leaning into each other, and kissing. One thing leads to another, and suddenly we're on the outskirts of town making out, and sheding our warm clothes, grinding, humping, exploring, and cuddling. (January in Canada is a tad chilly.) About an hour later, we drive back to my place. He talks about having a relationship with me, and visiting weekly. A few more heated kisses, and he's driving away. 

From there my downward spiral into hell commences. I've had self esteem and cutting issues for years, but within the span of 24 hours this incident took me from feeling amazing, to cutting anywhere I could. The emptiness of his promises is proven a couple weeks later when he decides to publicly display the disfunction of his relationship with another girl. They break up, and he begins awkwardly trying to sext me over Facebook. This stops when he makes up with his girlfriend. Now rinse and repeat... for 6 months. Everytime brought a new wave of depression and scars.

Mid-March: After an emotional breakdown, a couple close friends start to become enlightened to the hell I'm going through.

Mid-April: A couple friends who are aware of at least SOME of the situation take me to the guidence office and book an appointment with me. The next day I'm set up with a councillor. 

June 9, 2011. I decide to stop cutting, and see if I can't pull myself out of the abyss he threw me in.

At this point you're probably thinking ""Why didn't this chick or his girlfriend just drop him out of their lives?"". Have you ever seen Jar of Hearts by Christina Perri? That's how Marmite was. He sucked us in, trapped us, and had his two girls feeling murderous towards each other. 

Skip to July 9, 2011. He wants to hang out, I say sure. Suddenly I'm on my back in a field, telling him to stop, he's ignoring me and telling me he loves me. I tell him to slow down, he pressures me into trying. I try, and am in excrusiating pain. Instead of stopping like he promised, he begins going faster, rougher and harder, despite my cries and pleads for him to stop. I finally fight him off, only to have him force me into it again. Again, rinse and repeat. I know I was stupid, but I felt like a prudent bitch, and he kept begging, and insisting, and I didn't want to blue ball him. It happens again, and again I tighten and start freaking out. After I fight him off again, he holds my face into his crotch and makes me blow him until he cums down my throat. He drives me part way home then disappears.

July 10, 2011. I tell a couple extremely trust-worthy friends what happen, between major stomach cramps, and bouts of puking. 

July 11, 2011. Somehow through the whole ordeal I don't even bleed a little. That day I hemmorage blood, and continue to for the next couple weeks. Although I have no medical proof, I believe I may have miscarried a very early pregnancy. Marmite neglected to use a condom, and a fair amount of his attack was down there. (Pre-cum?) 

July 13, 2011. Surprise, surprise. Marmite was still with his current girlfriend when he raped me. I became a home-wrecking bitch. 

Mid-August: I see him and his girlfriend at the arena, and almost have a panic attack. He doesn't notice me and walks right by.

Early January: One of my best friends and I finally patch up our relationship after the drama with Marmite almost destroys our friendship. Since then he's helped me properly heal, after living broken for almost a year. 

Early April: He stalks me briefly at a public event, before assumably leaving. I overhear his mother telling my friends mom that he wants to move back to my town. I have a panic attack, run-off and hide with a friend who spends about an hour trying to calm me down. 

June 22, 2012: I learn that not only has he moved back, but he's 15 minutes away and works with some of my friends (who are unaware of the situation).

June 23, 2012: I'm almost positive that I see him and some new prey at an amusment park. 

This past week I was on vacation, and I legitimately spent the entire week freaking out that he would find me. 

Now: I've made it 13 months without cutting, and am working on patching up relationships that Marmite inadvertantly destroyed. Desire to cut is still strong though, and depression is a constant battle. 

Today is the anniversary though. What am I supposed to do? I can't walk alone or take the bus without worrying that I'll see him. I live my life in fear, worrying that he'll jump out from behind a bush, or show up at my church. (Yes, I do attend church, but Marmite has caused a huge crisis in faith, and I'm starting to fall away from religion.) I hate that I can't feel safe here in my bed because I know he knows where I live. I've destroyed his actual ex-girlfriend's life, wrecked my own, and can't get out of this death spiral.

The first time i heard about hes death, my dad came in the room and i was watching the champions league and he said Niko died and i said what, ( at this point my whole family was crying ) and he said again Niko died while crying hysterically, i have never seen my dad cry in my life, and there he was crying like a little babby, and i didnt even leet one tear go, i just couldnt belive it, it was 21:00 oclock when i found out, and for the next two hours i was staring at the same point and i didnt move an inch, i was just schocked, i never cryed before my sisters i just huged while they were crying, and then i went to my room and turned on Amy Winehouse and stated crying out laud. When i think of him, i just smile, i know he died of the most beautiful death he could of imagined, what gives me peace is that in the last couple of seconds he was the happiest man alive, he felt free and i know he didnt suffer, he is in heaven now, and when in a year i will seat on a bike he once had, he will be looking on me and protecting me, and every time i wake up, he smiles at me, and when i go to sleep he wishes me good night. People died, he died early, but what counts is what he experienced in hes short life, hes life was beautiful, he had great parents, great girlfriend of seven years, he loved the world and the world loved him, i dont dare to dream the moment we meet, im just a little sad he couldnt live to see me buy my first bike and ride with me

Self harm, mild depressions, the teenage angsty works. Some of that is in my past. 

I grew up and got over it and now Im a 19 yo college student living on her own, doing well in school, being responsible, adjusting to single partying lifestyle. And then all it took for my self-sufficient, confident self to absolutely fall apart was this sexual assault. And I don't know why... but it has brought out past self harm, new drinking/smoking weed excessively/other random drugs mostly e. It has brought back the numbness I felt in childhood, I never cried or really felt upset just very empty. Im able to lie and put a facade up for everyone because really, I'm just a shell. A crazy shell that makes no sense and probably makes no sense right now, I'm just kind of crazy. I cant fall asleep until 6 or 7 am and sleep all day but have terrible nightmares that I get in dejavu form during the daytime. I think weed is the reason I can sleep through my nightmares. I can't eat, unless I smoke. I can't stop feeling crazy unless I'm high, really.

I cant be touched, though I realize I have never liked to be touched and wonder where this comes from. Still, I have sex with guys because I don't feel like I can say no. Logically, I know this is sick and distorted. I also know, logically, I didnt have it coming. I didnt technically deserve it but god I was drunk and slutty and retarded so I really feel like I fucking asked for it. It's a scary shame, a scary guilt, and I hate that feeling. 

I also can't imagine anybody ever loving me again, but that must be distorted too. Im not terribly ugly, just terribly crazy, terribly broken.

Why would one minor event cause somebody to break like this, Reddit? I felt pain in the past, so why is pain now so much that I can't even allow myself to think of it.

It's almost 3:00 AM where I am and I haven't been sleeping well for a while.

The crux of the issue is that I turned 20 about two weeks ago and now I can't sleep anymore because I'm terrified of my own mortality. Ever hear the song *Ol' Man River*? With the line ""I'm tired of livin' and 'fraid of dyin'""? Well, that's me right now. I'm tired of worrying about what the future will bring, what death will be like, and what happens next.

The way I'm seeing things is that I'm now roughly 30% of the way through my life. That knowledge terrifies me to no end. Every night for the past week (and off and on for at least the past month) this is the first thought that pops into my head whenever I try to go to sleep. I can't help it, it just pops in and I can't go back to sleep. I cry for a little while, try to distract myself, and if I'm lucky I'm able to go back to sleep.

I think part of this problem also goes back to when I turned 10. My grandfather off-handedly made a comment about how I wasn't a single-digit kid anymore. This thought has remained with me ever since. I've also had a very strong fear of death since then. I remember crying in the tub because I caught my reflection too many times and thought of how I wouldn't be this young again.

Now I'm sitting here, my family sleeping soundly, and I'm trying to stave off horrified thoughts of death and loss. I'm not afraid of the physical consequences of death so much as I'm afraid of what will happen after my body shuts down. I know that there's no way of confirming anything (and Reddit is to my knowledge Atheism Central), but can someone at the very least tell me that there's nothing to be afraid of.

I hope I didn't take up too much of your time.

Long story short, I got little to none of it done (I'm horrible with long-term projects; it'd actually work better for me if they were assigned and due within two weeks, regardless of their size). Now my mom's on my ass constantly about it, and it's really starting to piss me off and annoy me. I know she means well, and that she just wants me to be successful, but I also know she's very upset with me. I'm sick of talking to her.

My personal view on the project is that I cannot and will not get it done in time, nor can I get it done right. I really have no idea what the project is asking of me. It's in several parts that are fairly involved. However, I've confronted my teacher about it twice now (""What can I do to get the best grade on this? I know it's all very late, blah blah blah, what would it behoove me to do?""), so I don't think she wants to hear any more of my shit. I just don't see how it's worth it to put in now hours-on-end of work for half-credit at best (she said she'd give me half-credit on all my late stuff). It's just not worth it to me. Especially if it turns out I don't do it right. I'd rather I just forget about all the late stuff and focus on what I need to turn in right now and in the future.

I have Ds in two classes and an F in one class. My other grades are three As and one B.

This is all very stressful for me. I feel like I'm just constantly letting my mom down (I've been missing homework regularly for the past three years now). I know I get a fresh start in grades next semester, but I can't handle this anymore. A lot of the time I just wish I was gone, so I wouldn't have to deal with this anymore, though I know I won't have to in a month or so. I'm not even depressed (though I have been in the past), so I really don't want to commit suicide or run away or something.

I just want everything to go away, but I don't think it will while my mom's bitching at me. What the hell do I do?

**tl;dr I have a bunch of missing assignments in school and my mom is constantly nagging me about them and I'm almost to the breaking point because of it. What should I do?**

Thanks for the responses. Unfortunately, I can't drop any of the classes, unless I want an automatic F (if you drop a class after three or so weeks after starting it, it automatically becomes an F on your transcript).

It was up to you whether or not you wanted to open up and either way was ok. Friendly people were just as appreciated as the quiet ones and people readily found common ground.

Honestly, where I live now, everyone seems super self-righteous and kinda mean. There's like, no sense of humor here (I'm considered ""hilarious"" and... I'm not.

I had to lock in my choice by Thursday, so I went on the site and did it on Tuesday. Only I didn't. I forgot to ""Submit"" that I locked in my choices.

Called up the university admissions office, and they tell me there is nothing they can do for me. So, basically I'm fucked.

Also, might as well ask random strangers some advice. If I'm not going to the university of my choice, I've got a few options.

1. Try and see if my third choice school has different policies for expired offers. Not a program that I would consider passionate about, but still a good school, and a good program.
2. Community College for a similar program to my first choice (Not too appealing)

All the same interests, hobbies, super easy to hang out with and talk to. He confessed to being emotionally unavailable because of a recent breakup, which I told him was fine since I was moving away anyway in a few short months. We skipped the part where we were friends first and jumped straight into being lovers. He later confessed to being in love with me. While I love him very dearly as a friend the timing was just all wrong and I'm not sure I reciprocate his feelings.

He told me that he had no expectations and he just wanted to be my friend and to let him deal with his feelings on his own. Despite this I am a perfectionist and could never remove the expectation from myself that I should *try* and have feelings for him too, try and want him. Finally, after weeks of arguments and blowups and really bad anxiety I realized that even just being friends wasn't going to work for me right now. I am going away on this year and I told him that communicating just wasn't working for me and I needed to re-focus on myself and going away and stop being consumed by this.

It just sucks because I feel like I lost a best friend. And that circumstance was against us from the start and we never had a real chance to be friends, to do things the right way. Maybe then we could have been on the same page. Or we did have a chance and we blew it for the sake of hedonism. I really just hope that somewhere down the road we can salvage some sort of relationship. It seems so tragic to me to lose this kind of connection. I know I should just move on and that there will be others, but it feels like life is too short to just let people go without a fight. And I fought for any kind of relationship until I was too exhausted to fight anymore and still couldn't fix it. MMFB, please reddit. I am so sad.

All my projects are filmed with my DSLR, on PVC pipe shoulder rigs. I say I want to concentrate on visual effects but I make sub-par Youtube quality effects for videos. Classmates and teachers say I'm a good editor and good with post effects but I think it's only because this school's never had someone who wanted to focus on that. Nobody really knows how to even open After Effects.

It's always been my dream to make videos for others to see. Not hollywood, not even TV, just Internet videos that would brighten someone's day, make one person smile, make another laugh, have one say ""that was so cool."" When I get the motivation to start that goal, it always falls. My friends can't make it. The shots don't look right. I shoot everything and the effects look like crap. Everything goes wrong to hold me back.

I see everyone's projects and they're amazing. The classmates at school work almost professionally, the reels on r/aftereffects are astounding... and I'm sitting here with my sub-par knowledge and I graduate in the winter. I'm absolutely terrified that once I graduate, I'm going to have absolutely no direction for this at all. I can't even work with visual effects professionally because I'm not close enough to any post houses.

My dream's slowly being crushed, and it's my fault. I don't know what to do. No matter how hard I practice I never see myself getting better. I always feel miserable when I think about the upcoming week of school.

It still bothers me.,16,2,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/1g1wgi/cut_my_brother_out_of_my_life_as_best_i_could_it/,"I've got an only brother who is 25. He's currently unemployed, living with my dad and looking for jobs in his field. I'm 27, have a stable career and am currently going to be moving to Europe at the end of July with my fiancé to advance in my career.

My brother and I have never been particularly close growing up. He's very sensitive to the point where the slightest misunderstanding throws him into an rage of insults. He can't control his emotions very well and is still stuck in the mentality to lash out at anyone who annoys him (to which he rationalizes as ""I don't take shit from anyone""). Very narrow minded and opinionated too. He's often outright stated ""I'm right, you're wrong"" during arguments in adulthood. After a particularly harsh berating a year ago, I decided for the sake of my own mental health to cut him out of my life. I've been trying to decades to form a healthy relationship with him, but it's very much a one-way street.

So since then I've kind of held a no-expectations policy with him. I say hello and goodbye and if he talks to me (he doesn't) I converse civilly. I don't go out of my way though, and I certainly don't let his attitude get to me (most of the time). There have been times where I put out my hand to say goodbye at family gatherings and he just stares blankly into the distance, veins almost popping out of his forehead.

Yesterday my dad planned a wonderful engagement party with the extend family for my fiancé and I. Of course, my brother didn't show up and made an excuse to avoid it entirely. My dad is a great guy, but he enables my brother's behavior so much because he's got issues of his own (whole other story). It was great party, lots of laughs and fun, good food. We made sure to thank everyone for their gifts and support and we left when a good chunk of the rest were already gone.

We get home and fall asleep. At 11PM I get a text from my brother. It's probably the first communication from him in months. It's a short message that basically states my dad is upset and that it is all our fault for being unappreciative of all he did today. Never mind the fact that I didn't hear anything from my dad, and that my brother wasn't even there.

So I text him back, saying I'm sorry he felt that we seemed unappreciative today and that it was not the case and that I would like to see him before I left for Europe. He responded back in kind, calling me selfish and an asshole and all sorts of colorful names. We went back and forth, me killing with kindness and him slinging mud. I tried calling my dad during this time, only went to voicemail (which I left and told him to call me).

So yeah. I'm pissed at my brother for being a hypocrite. I'm frustrated at a misunderstanding with my dad. And I really hate the fact that I cannot have a brother who I can have a healthy relationship with.

So thoughts? Anyone cut off a family member? How did you deal?

I'm a 23-year-old female college student with (diagnosed) Asperger's syndrome. I've been sick (a medical trainwreck) since I was eleven, which made my entire adolescence incredibly isolated from my peers and which has made it so I have a very difficult time relating at all to the life experiences of anyone my age. Being homeschooled didn't help with the isolation, even though homeschooling was invaluable because I was too sick to be in school anyway, and even though my parents put a lot of effort into me having social opportunities.

A bit more than a year ago I was invited to join a very small Dungeons and Dragons group, and I've been going every week except when it's been canceled. I was finally starting to feel like I fit in.

But then one of the people in the group started randomly fucking yelling at me for tiny things, over and over, and I've been afraid to be around her because it makes me hate myself and hurt myself and lock myself in my house and not come out for weeks.

And now? None of them are responding to my texts and they're going and doing things without me. I feel fucking worthless and repulsive and awful. Why did I even think they might want anything to do with me? Why did I even bother? How the fuck could I have deceived myself like that? Why am I such a worthless piece of shit who nobody would ever give a shit about?

And to cope with that, I keep fantasizing about (other) people I respect actually caring about me and wanting to be around me. I won't go into that because it makes me feel creepy as hell even though it's certainly nothing sexual, but I will say that these fantasies becoming reality is an extremely implausible scenario, and that's not from a depressed of-course-nobody-would-care-about-me point of view.

And that just makes it worse, knowing that the only thoughts that seem to help are so very unlikely to be (and shouldn't be) actualized, and I berate myself for even thinking these things, and I hate myself more.

I met my ex-gf (hereby known as Felicity) about 2.5 years ago. Things went exceptionally well and I knew I had found the right person for me. Almost from the first conversation we had, (about her baking disasters and me being a CIA agent) I knew I had found the right person for me. She was someone that understood me, and someone who really loved me for he I am, and for no reason other than that. Very quickly into our relationship, she let me know that she had a daughter. And I was fine with that, despite the fact that I was some loser of a man who didn't have what it took to take care of a family at that time.

After only two months, I told her that I love her. It was the first time I've ever said that to anyone, and the first time I have ever felt that. Just to provide a bit of background about myself: I was abused as a child. My parents favored my brother over me since childhood. I was beat regularly and for any reason whatsoever. I watched as both my father and mother swung their hands violently after me, and I felt as they struck me with their hands, or any weapon they could find. One of the earliest memories I have of my life is of me feeling suicidal and crying.

Saying I love you to Felicity was the first time I have ever felt that way about anyone. I knew I was on to something. About 6 months later, she introduced me to her daughter, at the time she was 6 years old. I had no clue what I was doing and it was the best time of my life.

Because my ex was afraid that I might leave her and her daughter when I got bored or whatever, she never let me actually meet her daughter in person. I've only known her voice, her pictures, and one video, Her daughter and I started off our relationship by playing video games. 

First, Left 4 Dead 2. She enjoyed that game so much. It made her brave, it scared her, it made her laugh and scream from terror; it made us get close. I helped her kill zombies, and she helped me kill zombies. She'd have me kill all of the witches because those were the scariest monsters in the game. Every time I failed to properly kill a witch, she'd laugh at me. And she'd heal me as soon as I got up. She'd heal me whenever I got any damage on me at all. That was her favorite thing; healing.

After Left 4 Dead 2, we started playing World of Warcraft together and that was so much fun. I took her all around the world and showed her everything there was to see in that game. I took her to all the dungeons and we talked about what we liked and didn't like. I took her to some of the questing areas and we rescued the creatures in the cages, or we killed the evil creatures. I took her to Dalaran and we played hide and seek. We played cops and robbers, too. Right by the flower stand. I'd act like I stole a bunch of flowers and she'd chase me all throughout Dalaran.

Shortly after that, my ex Felicity and I started having problems with our relationship. Mostly my fault. Jealousy, fear of abandonment, and a feeling of everlasting neglect that I felt at the time. None of that was warranted. It was all me. After one really big fight, we stopped talking and because of that, I stopped talking to her daughter, too. That fight was on the 22nd of May 2012, and the last time I talked to her daughter was on the 21st of May.

A few weeks later, after I regained my composure, my ex and I started talking again. I told her I'd change. A few months later and the same problems were still there. I promised I'd change again. Winter of 2012 began and still, the same fucking problems all over again. We stopped talking around the end of December and I began a long journey to getting better. I began to fight every single thing that I suffered in my childhood. All of the depression, the neglect, the abandonment, I fought all of that and once I *knew* I was a better person, I contacted my ex again in late February of 2013.

And things were going so well. Not a single argument. I wasn't a prick any more. I was the idea person to date, the ideal father figure. I had educated myself so I could get a better career. I had read parenting books. I was saving money so I could move in with Felicity and her daughter. My relationship with Felicity was perfect. I was happy and although she hated me still, I knew she still loved me and wanted things to work out.

I looked forward to hanging out with her daughter again. I was doing so well that I knew it would not be long before I could talk to her again.

This last weekend, her daughter was in a car accident. She suffered severe brain injuries and was unfortunately not able to recover. Today, my ex texted me that she'd never wake up.

And there you go. That's the end of that. Maybe it was destiny, although I don't believe in that, but even if that were the case, I could have gotten at least another year with her if I hadn't been such a fucking idiot. Fighting over the most senseless things I could think of at the time. Not realizing that everything I've ever wanted was right there in front of me already. We had talked about getting married and having kids together. 

Her daughter said ""I love you"" to me for the first time a few days before we stopped talking.

""I am a person who always puts on a façade. No single person on earth would suspect that the way I act around my friends is literally just an act. I just keep my emotions where they are – on the inside. Like, a layer of my personality which is what I let other people see, and layer beneath that, for the entire sixteen years of my life, no one other than me has ever seen, which holds my true personality. In my opinion emotions were not made for sharing. They’re made for *trading*. But there was one person who, for the first time in my entire life, made me think otherwise. I was *this* close to showing *her* that second layer. But I screwed it up. All of it.
I was greedy. I had finally experienced the taste of accomplishment. But that was not enough. No, not at all. I wanted more; I didn’t want just a taste, but the whole dish - but *she* didn’t. My heart’s been broken before – but the feeling of being rejected by this *one girl* was something entirely alien to me. It’s honestly something I've never felt before. At this point in my life, it’s easy to let things go. *Forget*. I mean – *It’s better to have love then lost than to never have loved at all,* right? Well, not if that love is as one-sided as a conversation with a *fucking* wall.
I guess I was just caught up in the moment. Watching too many movies does that to you, I guess. But now I think to myself: “This is no *fucking* movie, you don’t get a *fucking* happy ending.” Hah. If only I’d realized that sooner. If only I’d realized that this is *real life*. I’m not going to get some checkpoint that I can go back to after I fuck everything up, like some video game. No, I had to live with my decisions. With my mistakes. Well fuck that.
The thing is, I spent weeks mustering up the courage to change who I was. *I hated me*. The ‘me’ who just sat inside all day, and did nothing with his life. The ‘me’ who had no intentions of starting some high school romance with the *girl* who sat next to me in physics class. So I changed. I changed into the ‘me’ who I wanted to be: strong, courageous, outgoing. I started working out, changed my personality (albeit not so much externally as internally), and started getting closer to her. The process was slow, and at the end of the each day I could look back at my progress and say, “Yeah, this is definitely going to work.” Isn’t that a pretentious and utterly self-righteous way to look at things? “This is definitely going to work” – I honestly wish I could go back in time and *beat myself to death*. What the *fuck* was I thinking? I thought I was mature at this point in my life – I had the ability to look at myself and say, “This isn’t a very healthy lifestyle” and just straight up do something about it. Now, I reckon I still got a lot of maturing to go before I get to where I want to be.
Eventually, I was able to change into the ‘me’ who I wanted to be, but what I didn’t realize was that it was the ‘me’ that I couldn’t be. I wasn’t made to be ‘strong’ or ‘courageous’ – I was destined to be the social outcast who limited their interactions with other human beings as much as possible. I finally asked *her* – *out* that is, and I just got flat out rejected. *Twice*. Something must’ve been wrong in my head for me to even fathom asking her out, let alone actually doing it. Not to mention the fact that I did it twice...
I made a fool of myself. *She* just wanted to be friends. *I* didn’t. It was never going to work out. That much is obvious. But not to me.
I guess all I can do at this point is forget the burdens of the past. Don’t worry about the future – it comes soon enough. Live in the present. *Forgive and forget.* **Everything.**""

Just something I wrote last night while I was depressed from being rejected by my crush.

Here's some more background info if you're interested (it's a long and unnecessary read, you can just skip to the bottom of the post):
When I was twelve I used to talk to this girl online, but after a few months of doing this, we started to drift apart (and I failed to accept this). Gone were the days where the motivation I had to keep me going through my school days was to lay down all my emotions to this one girl whose age I was never sure of. Because of this, I got into playing video games after-school, which were a major time sink with no real benefit, and ended up rethinking who I am, and how I've been acting all my life. This resulted in me becoming a very anti social person - normally only communicating with people who talk to me first (mind you, this does not mean I didnt try to act like a better person around others). When I got into high school, I kinda relied on my cousin to help me merge in with the groups there. I got into a group who played similar video games, and everything was all well and good -  other than the times at night where I lay down in my bed and wonder what I've been doing with my life (and sometimes crying myself to sleep). As a growing high school boy, I couldn't help but stare at the girls who passed by, but none of them piqued my interest. Skip to four years later, and I become friends with a girl whose personality I just end up falling in love with. It began with 'Oh, alright, I get to sit next to this hot girl in Physics' to the two of us joking around, teasing each other and generally having a good time. I didn't want to admit it, but I loved her - and I was completely afraid of doing anything that might ruin our friendship. I then thought to myself, that I can't just sit around and do nothing about this; I needed to man up and ask her out. And so I did. Bit by bit, I was working my way towards her: I started working out, talking more often, getting close to her friends, walking home with her and spending time with her on the weekends. And eventually when we were walking home together, I shut off my brain and my stupid mouth just went ahead and asked her out. She then told me that she never thought of anything more than friends. But I couldn't accept just being rejected like that. No, I had to do something. So I told her this: *""Look, I thought about what you said, and as much as I want to accept that you just want to be friends - I can't. The reason I wanted to ask you out was because I wanted a chance to be seen by you as more than a friend. I know you probably want things to stay as they are now, but I can't live with myself knowing that I just gave up after asking you once. That's why I want you to reconsider - and if you truly don't want anything more, then just say the word, and I'll be happy to oblige.""*

You guys helped me put stuff in perspective; you're all awesome!! Thanks so much!!**

I've had several stressors piling up this week, but I hadn't really let any of them get to me until today.

So there's a blood drive here on campus. They come every once in a while; I try to donate once a year since coming to college. First and third years, I got it done, almost passing out in the process (I think it's mostly in my head; thanks for that gene, Dad!), but I got the job done. Felt damn proud about it, too, insofar that I choose to donate when I know what it'll do to me for a while. Second year, they wouldn't let me since I was still recovering from a cold, but they gave me a shirt anyway. I remember asking them not to give it to me, but it wasn't a huge deal. Bad timing and all that.

That brings us to today, within my fourth year at UT. I hadn't eaten much the first day I saw them here, and I didn't have time yesterday, but today, I planned around that shit. Ate a pretty hefty breakfast, powered through some truly awful grapes (I never knew it was possible to fuck up grapes, but there you go), cost myself a trip home before heading back to campus.

I was a little nervous going in, what with the whole fainting thing, but I had the Captain America soundtrack on my phone to keep me motivated. I felt kinda badass, actually. They cleared me for donating, I got ready; everything was set.

I can never recall how long it takes to donate blood, but it's...a pretty long process, turns out. So there I am, having my essence drained out of me, and I just keep thinking to myself, ""holy crap, I'm saving lives."" After what seems like forever, they finally take the needle out of my arm. That wasn't so bad; I'm not even lightheaded!

They inform me that I wasn't hydrated enough, that they can't take any more out of me, something scientific, blah. Not wholly unexpected; I'm kinda terrible about that, I guess. I ask if they can at least use what I've donated. They say no, that the anticoagulant they use is set for a particular amount of blood that exceeds that which I can provide for them. Essentially, I just spent about an hour waiting, testing, and bleeding out for nothing. All that heroic motivation? Shaggy dog story. I haven't saved anyone today.

I'm not sure why I'm beating myself up about this, out of everything. I mean, I tried. I could have easily just not, so that should count for something. But that doesn't really matter, seems like. People waiting for transfusions don't benefit from the blood the doctors are throwing away as I type. I feel so fucking useless right now. The bandage on my arm is a lie, and I'm ready to take it off so no one else has to ask me if I've donated. Again, I really have no idea where my attitude is coming from. This usually isn't me. I don't give this any thought when the blood drives aren't around. But for whatever reason, it's messing me up now.

We broke up 4 months ago. I broke it off because of multiple reasons. I still love him the way I did when we were together, but because I knew we couldn't work out, I broke things off. I started talking to him a few days ago (just to catch up because he was my best friend). I started thinking that we could get back together until I asked the single most important question of all. 

""Do you have a girlfriend?"" 
I guess we can all guess the answer to that since I'm here. 

He says that he still loves and is still in love with me, but i know that's all bullshit. He took a long time in our relationship to tell me that he loved me. And 4 months, he's already told her that he loves her. Is it always going to suck like this? 

My friends don't understand and just says move on, forget him. But it's not that easy. It feels like my whole world is collapsing and I just want the floor to swallow me up.

I figured it would come as more of a relief than anything once it happened--she wanted to get married, and unfortunately I could not see myself spending the rest of my life with her, and it was painful to attempt to convince myself that I could possibly change my mind on the subject.

The main reason is that she has a disability, resulting from a car accident when she was very young. It's nothing too severe, but it's definitely noticeable when you meet/talk to her...mostly motor-based but some cognitive as well. I looked past this when we first started dating and, indeed, the past few years since. While I loved everything else about her, this was constantly getting in the way. I felt embarrassed to go on public outings with her, to have her meet my friends and family. I felt like a complete asshole because of this--that I couldn't stand to be seen with somebody I otherwise really liked, simply because of something she had no control over since very early on in her life. I tried to convince myself that I could eventually see past it, that it wouldn't bother me after enough time, and that might've been one of the main reasons things lasted as long as they did.

In other words I thought things would work out better if it was more of a mutual split-up than me just straight up dumping her because of a physical flaw. It did feel like a huge weight was lifted off my shoulders when we finally agreed to split up, but that was two days ago now. I feel like something's been ripped out of my chest.

I don't know how much I should go into this but the whole reason we've not been taking is my fault. I was stupid enough to fall in love with the guy and his mother doesn't think I'm ""gilfriend material"" because of my mental health issues etc.
Then, I dunno, I feel like this is just ""bluh bluh whiny teenager bullshit"", despite me being 20, but....I just... I dunno, he said he has feelings for me, and kissed me a few months ago (which, I guess it's pathetic, since before that i'd never been kissed by anyone - i'd never even gone as far as hand-holding in a romantic sense...) and a week later he's 'dating' a girl he's never met irl, and has only been speaking  to for a few moths online.
He talks about her on-stop... and.... it kills me. And, when I mentioned this to him, he promised to stop and then continued the second I went to bed. (we had been talking online) And the last time I spoke to him, he got angry at me for being depressed.
I.... I dunno how to describe it further.

I'm just proving time and time again that I'm never gonna be good enough for him.

I'm sorry for the wall of text.... and complainng about this but I'm really not doing well today. That therapy session opened these wounds up, and I've been trying my best to ignore them.

I feel like I would so much rather be alone for the rest of my life than to ever give absolutely anyone the ability to hurt me again. Which honestly... Everyone always hurts me. No matter what.

Why things happen to me. (If you want to know a lot of the things that have happened to me feel free to look back at my previous post.. Be warned though, it is long.)
I look back on the person I once use to be and it am just that much more devastated. I use to be so very outgoing. Everyone loved me. People were drawn to me like I was the air they needed to survive on... Now... People cannot wait to be rid of me from their lives.

I cry... All the time. I am stuck inside my own warped head. I feel like I cannot escape. I had a nightmare again last night. When I woke up my boyfriend had already left for school. I was panicking. I couldn't even get out of bed. I literally hid underneath the covers like some kind of child. I use to be so strong. I use to know my worth. One of the worst things is after I posted the last time I had a great day. I stood up for what I was worth. I had the ability to actually show my boyfriend how much I love him. I was able to actually let myself love. But then I slipped again. I am falling back into the dark hole that is my life. It doesn't matter what anyone says. No matter what anyone says it is like some kind of lose lose for them. I get hurt by every little thing. It is like I am so afraid of being hurt that I put myself through hurt and pain all the time so when it happens I just expect it. I just know it is coming. I am just so messed up... So very messed up... So broken. I literally feel broken. Like I would starve if it weren't for the fact that my boyfriend forces me to eat. He does so much for me. Goes to school... Work... Cleans... Takes care of me and our two dogs... and here's me... Unable to do anything besides go into work where I continue to barely function. I work in customer service.... I have a terrible fear of people. When people come up behind me I jump and squeal like they were going to attack me. It scares people. I know it does... But I cannot help it. It just happens.

I'm honest to god in a greater panic right now, typing this, than I was after getting in a car accident-- and it's been fifteen hours since it went missing.  Because I came out of that accident relatively unscathed, but no matter what- even if I find the cash soon and with relative ease -I'm still going to be shit out of luck for all the work I've lost.  That's going to cut straight to the bone if I don't recover my laptop, no ifs, ands, no doubt about it.  Like, holy shit, my notes were on that machine.  My notes from two years of engineering classes.  And the copies of my textbooks.  Almost every single project I've ever completed for school, some of which I was relying on for my co-ops.  The programs I was working on.  Like, I've got some backups lying around, but not all of them, and not all of the most recent versions.  If each hour of work can be said to be worth just seven bucks and a quarter, I've lost thousands.

It's like, I can't just not have a laptop.  In my program, there's no way around it, it'd destroy me.  My PC is an old Acer that someone's letting me borrow, it's underpowered, and I've only got use of it 'til they come back from overseas in a couple months.   I've got about a week before I fall behind, and I would not come out intact if I lost my precious GPA over a stolen laptop.  That might sound like, maladaptive, I realize what I might sound like, but it's actually super important to me.  I felt physically ill the first time I got a B, y'know?  Even if it's not that imminent, realizing that my scholarships could be at risk if I don't get a new laptop soon just, I wouldn't have a whole lot to fall back on.  And I know it sounds like it's my fault for putting all of my eggs in one basket and not making appropriate backups or saving up properly, not anticipating things like this, but this is a long string of bad luck.  My external HDD went corrupt, for instance, and I had spend for a good chunk of cash on those repairs from that car accident I mentioned.  I'm not a wealthy person in general anyway, y'know?  I'm seriously only worth 'seven bucks and a quarter', and my boss keeps trying to cut down on my hours.  Still haven't furnished my room, scraping by on rice for one meal out of every day, etc.  And it's like shit, why's this gotta happen.  Who's serving up this shit souffle anyway?

I could probably take a panorama of my room and that would show off the majority of my belongings.  There ain't a whole lot that I could really sell; I'd probably come away a hundred bucks richer if I got rid of the majority of my stuff.  Add in the hundred bucks I've got in loose change and bills, and the two in my bank account, and I'm downgrading from a $1,000 laptop adequate for my schoolwork to something about half that.  Except, fuck, how am I gonna pay for things like, y'know, rent this month?  I'm going to start wracking my brain for people to borrow money from, and that makes me feel like a giant piece of shit.  I'm new in this state.  I can't imagine going up to someone I've known for sixth months and going ""dude I seriously need to borrow some cash"", like what kind of twat would I be.

The sound of fireworks is a constant reminder of how lonely I am, and how ignored that I feel. I really tried last year (2012) I REALLY TRIED HARD to make new friends, I really tried to be more open minded than I already was...

Every year is the same. I'm always alone around NYE, XMAS and my birthday. For some reason, none of my ""friends"" seem to really care about me. I'm lucky to have a SO and my family, but NYE isn't supposed to be a night with the family, it's supposed to be a night of joy and partying with the people you love to hang out with, the peers that love you for your personality and your qualities.

My last remaining friend is traveling abroad for work, and I really don't know if I'll make it through 2013 without developing a depression.

About me:
I study medicine (I only know a few people at the university, I can't relate to most of the other people. It's too snobby an environment for me)
I produce music.
I LOVE hip hop, blues, soul and jazz.
I love books, comedy, sports and computer games.
I'm into dungeons and dragons (geeky? Since 2000!).
I love traveling (went on an interrail trip this summer across Europe with my friend. Had the greatest time in years).
I don't like letting people down.
I'm honest.
I care about other people.
I love helping out.
I hate snobs.
I don't care about the color of your skin, your (non-) religious beliefs or your sexual preferences. 
I don't drink alcohol, do drugs or eat non-halal food.

I'm the type of guy who doesn't mind paying for the movie ticket when I'm out with my best friend, because I believe in karma (not the reddit kind). If we're taking a walk and I buy sodas for us, DON'T bring it up a week later, that you owe me for a fucking soda, life is too short for that shit to matter :)

MMFB, what can I do?

Edit: wow, thanks for the comforting comments - you guys really made me feel better! 
I spend my NYE alone in bed, watching TED talks and browsing Reddit, eventually falling asleep.
About my SO: Apparently, she was under the impression that I didn't want to do anything for NYE, so she decided to invite some of her own friends over for drinks and a movie night, which really disappointed me. 
We are opposites when it comes to alcohol - she likes to drink low% alcohol, while I can't even stand being in the same room as people who drink. And of course, the entire company was drinking. Needless to say, we didn't ring in NYE together - but she did come in to me around 01 pm. 

Thank you guys - hopefully things will change this year. My birthday is 8 months away and I don't want to feel abandoned again.

* Because I barely have any money, to provide for me and my family.
* Because after having a shit youth and shit few years with my ex, I finally found some happiness; I miss her so so very much right now.
* Because I choose to provide for my wife and the boys from half way across the world, due to not getting a job/work permit in the country of my wife and the youngest not being able to get a passport, due to lack of birth certificate.
* Because this puts me in a catch 22; I can't move until I've secured income and closing the distance just feels eons away.
* Because I can't even call an emergency number due to lack of balance.
* Because with the break up with my ex last year, most of the friends that I had introduced her too, chose her side.
* Because it was universally stupid to think that I could find happiness and keep it.
* Because I got pulled off of a project due to bullshit politics.
* Because I've been struggling with keeping everything up for the past year.
* Because I have no one that I really feel I can talk to; except those few Redditors, you know who you are!

And mostly...

* Because I've been so desperate that I've literally been posting all over Reddit the past few days.
* Because aside from a few useful conversations, I'm still stuck in the same place.
* Because I tried to do online freelance stuff, only to run into a Nigerian gang trying to pull off some con.
* Because even after only having 1 slice of toast yesterday and being persuaded to ask for help in /r/RandomActsOfPizza I still felt guilty for asking for help and depriving others of a possible meal.
* Because I have no idea how we're going to pay the second half of this months rent, let alone next month's.

And to top it off...

* Because everyone is wishing each other a merry xmas.
* Because I'm not spending this xmas with my wife and kids; kids that aren't mine, but I accept as such.
* Because whatever I tried, everyone is pointing to someone else; not even airlines have a sense of humanity.

* Because I'm spending Christmas alone.
* Because I can't be ""home"" with loved ones.

So, there you have it... I'm sorry, but anyone daring to wish me a merry xmas from here on, can just suffocate on a big floppy Equus africanus asinus phallus.

I'm not going to kill myself, because a wise Redditor managed to get through to me, to not give up. I want to see her smile!

I ended up failing the test with a 59%.


I don't know how this could have happened. We had a 9 day break for Thanksgiving and I studied day and night, every day. I did the online notecards and scored 30,000 points (over 3 times the next highest score in my class), which consist of 200+ questions, multiple times. I read the book, I went through my notes several times. I was confident that this would be the test to turn everything around for me.


But I failed it and now its too late in the semester for me to get my grade up to a C-. I don't know how the online quizzes and required lab grades will be factored in, but I'm pretty sure they won't be enough to save me from failing.


A month ago, I signed up for classes for next semester and chose the next bio class (and lab) and a chem class (and lab). I need a C-, at least, to take those classes but I don't think I'll be able to get it. It is way past the date to withdraw from courses without getting a 0.


What the hell do I do know? I just sent an email to my adviser, but I doubt I'll get a response for a while. Do I just have to drop out of school and wait until next year to try again? 


I wanted to be a doctor someday and go into Bio-Med or Gen Bio, but I don't think that is possible anymore. That was the only reason why I came to this college in the first place.


I can't stop crying right now because I don't see any hope if I can't make it here. I told my mom but she just ignored me and is acting to stubborn by saying it doesn't matter and that she'll just call the school. Obviously, that won't do anything because the school isn't allowed to talk to her anyway, they'd probably just laugh, and my professor would just be annoyed.


She says I can just take it over again, but I'd have to wait until next year and there is no way my family has enough money to spend another 25 grand tuition, *without* a $10,000 scholarship this time, just so I can try the same classes all over again.


I know it will look horrible anyway when my transcript shows an F in the field I want to get a job in.


Damn it I studied so hard for this fucking test and I was counting on it to be the one that saved me. There were only 40 fucking questions, but when I looked over it, I was only positive in my answer for 20 of them.

The one that sounds like ""she fucked the next-door neighbor and then left me for my best friend at the time"". The breakup was emotionally ugly for all involved and a financial disaster for myself. We've kept little contact over the years aside exchanging some terse messages over Facebook about a few remaining financial matters and the occasional stink-eye in public.

Honestly, I despised that woman and him with every fiber of my being. I never got so much as a hint of remorse from either of them and it made me seethe with rage and hatred. I did everything for her save give her the shirt off my back and it was never good enough. I ruined myself financially to keep her afloat to the point of handing over entire paychecks just to keep a fucking roof over our head. But I was an asshole because I was unwilling to shell out booze money so her shithead friends could come over and puke on our carpet, clog our toilets, and turn our living room into a fucking dance club at 3 in the morning.

Needless to say, I was angry for a long time and it festered in me and made me extremely cynical and apprehensive about relationships. It also dredged up a lot of trust and intimacy issues from my less-than-stellar childhood that my unfortunate - but saint-like - wife has had to deal with since we met. 

A few months ago, she reached out and asked how I was. She also asked if I was ""still mad at her"". I replied - in the most mature way possible - that I moved on to better things and that she was a mistake and life lesson well-learned. I never got a reply.

I found out yesterday that she tried to hang herself and is now comatose. It doesn't look good. Part of me takes morbid satisfaction in knowing that this stupid bitch who made a fool of me and showed so little regard for my emotional well-being is finally getting hers. The more rational and compassionate part of me is absolutely disgusted with myself and sees nothing but a senseless waste. I wonder if her contacting me was some attempt at reconciliation and that in my blind hatred I missed an opportunity to finally have some good come out of experience together by helping her not harm herself.

His father (my grandfather) was abusive, ran around, and drank a lot.  My father and his brothers ended up quitting school and taking care of themselves. He had a speech impediment that embarassed him most of his life. His first wife died years ago (he raised her ungrateful daughters - his step-children, who abandoned him after their mother died.)  His next love died of a brain tumor 10 years ago.  He has had a drinking problem. Like most people in this economy, his most recent job went away. He was diagnosed with colon cancer a few months ago.  A few days ago, he shot himself in his home.  He tried to reach out to a neighbor in the middle of the night, but she missed the call.  He died of what seems to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound shortly thereafter.

Just this one day.,20,2,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/rpgsp/need_support_today_can_anyone_mmfb_it_would/,"The basics: during 4 years at a low-level IT job I was totally overqualified for, I endured bullying, death threats, sexual harassment, and getting stabbed in the back and lied to repeatedly by all my bosses AND by HR.

A week ago I was attacked on the job, in front of a bunch of people, including my boss's boss (one of the biggest liars and back stabbers).  My reaction was NOT physical retaliation, but verbal.  I read the attacker the riot act: ""You ever do that again, I'll break your arm or put your eyes out.  You have no idea who you're dealing with.  You attack me from behind like that, I go berserk.  Anyone would.  What do you expect?  Sorry, but I don't have any control over my reactions when you grab me near my genitals and pin me to the ground—so watch out.  You've been warned.""

During this whole speech, the guy who grabbed me was giggling, like it was no big deal.  Who IS this guy?  I've been asking myself ever since that moment.  I guess he never graduated from Kindergarten.

My boss's boss showed up right then and told ME: ""Stop it!  Enough is enough.""  

I couldn't believe it.  He was disciplining ME, when the other guy had violated so many sexual harassment and violence in the workplace laws that I could have sued right then.

I went straight to HR and told them the entire story.  I was on the edge of tears the whole time.

Anyway, I thought about it all weekend, just felt more and more terrified about continuing to work at this place, so I gave two weeks' notice Monday morning the minute my shift began.

Now, here's the bad part:  I'm living in terror now, every day, but especially when I'm at the job.  I have four days left.  I am terrified my boss's boss will take me into his office, shut the door, and start screaming at me (which he has done many times in the past).  The dude is very intimidating.  He grew up in a family of boxers.  

I've made arrangements with HR such that I don't have to be left alone with him, but he's still jerking me around, trying to get time with me away from others.  Why?  Because my departure is ruining his reputation.  I was THE best on my team, got the highest raises, and the highest bonuses.

So how do I get through these last four days starting tomorrow?  I'm terrified.  I couldn't even get out of bed this morning; I had a panic attack when I woke up, and that segued into this terror mode I've been stuck in for a week.

Please help if you have any good ideas.  I have a good friend who's been my therapist for weeks (he's seen it all in our line of work), but I don't want to keep taking advantage of his favors.

How does one approach the final four days of the most toxic job one has ever had (and this is after being in the workforce nearly 4 decades)?

My previous relationship was long-distance (me in Kansas City, her in Baltimore) so this was a nice change. She lived about 30 minutes from me, but that was better than nothing.

As time went on, I was feeling really left-out and un-wanted. I repressed those feelings a lot because I was sure I was just overreacting. But I eventually let her know. Big mistake on me, I guess. We didn't see eachother for a while, then the week before Christmas she broke it off with me. She said I was making her feel bad because I had told her how I felt. She also said she needed to focus on school and work, so she didn't have time for a boyfriend. I really felt bad, but I started to get over it.

Until New Year's Eve. Not even two weeks after she had told me one of the reasons she broke up with me was because she had no time to focus on a boyfriend, she was posting all this on Facebook about how she was out on New Year's Eve with her new boyfriend. It made me fucking sick and depressed and all this other stuff. Now I feel like she lied to me just to get rid of me, since she got someone else so soon even though she led me to believe otherwise.

Everytime I see her stuff on Facebook and whatever, I get really angry and incredibly upset. I can't help it. I don't know whether to talk to her and give her a piece of my mind or just let it go or I dunno. I really feel like complete shit.

Thinking you're gonna have someone to spend the Holidays with, then getting it taken away at the last second, REALLY sucks. :(

tl;dr - dated awesome girl, felt unwanted, let her know, she breaks up with me saying she couldn't have boyfriend, she gets boyfriend 10 days later, i r sad panda

I don't know what to do to help someone else feel better, and I know that others have problems that are more than likely worse than mine, but I figured it'd be therapeutic, maybe, to get it out.

I worked at a shitty fast food restaurant. It wasn't a special job. It wasn't the hardest job. Hell, it wasn't difficult at all. Maybe that's why it stings so much; it was such a stupid, menial job and I wasn't good enough, I wasn't smart enough to do the right thing to keep it.

I'm posting this because I can't stand to look at my girlfriend without feeling immense guilt. I know how her parents will respond.

my health is not really good at the moment. I'm not going into details. This is worrying me. 

I'll spend new year's eve in a foreign country for me, on my own. I'm terribly superstitious about this. I've always believed the way you start a new year is the summary of how the whole year will be. I'm terrified that 2012 will be sad and lonely then. I really need some happy news for 2012...

As I've been fighting for my health and happiness on my own for the last months, I guess I've spent too much time thinking about it.

I know some people do really suffer and have terrible problems, which is why I feel ashamed of my silly reaction. 
In my mind, it's a bit like I'll die on the 31st evening, which is stupid to say, I'm sorry. This is just how I feel and even with all the sensible arguments in the world, I can't help thinking that way.

Liked to climb legs and do other nosy kitty things.

Some background on my mother: She has a horrible, HORRIBLE temper.  Littlest things set her off and she flies into a rage, throwing things, screaming, stomping, threatening me, and then bursting into tears through the middle of it.  Not very related to the actual incident but related to the catalyst, she is also a hoarder.

My mother and brother got into a yelling argument before she left for work, and they were yelling at each other as she approached the door.  She had it open and was still screaming at him (over the fact that I had thrown out 2 year old meat in the freezer and am now labeled ""wasteful"" for it) and decided to slam the door to make her point.  The little guy had crept near her foot and stayed there as she slammed the door on him, and crushed him.

I did not witness it with my eyes, but I heard it through my bedroom door. I heard her say ""oh fucking well"" and slam the door again, leaving this time.  I don't know if the kitten ran outside, because he was nowhere to be found in the house.  I have looked and looked outside all afternoon and I cannot find him.

I get a text from my mother saying that she felt bad about killing my kitten and that she didn't mean to, but you can't take that back.  I told her I hoped she learned to curb her nasty temper and to watch what she was doing, and I was met with ""I was closing the door like I always do!  It's not my fault!""  I retorted with that I heard her and my brother fighting and I heard what she said, and I told her that she had a lot of nerve to assume I'm that big of an idiot.  Then her end of the conversation spiraled into her hating herself and feeling horrible and sorry for herself and I just ended it there.  I didn't dignify her with any more answers.

..but don't believe it, you should never feel that way and here is why.

I know this feeling worthless thing all too well. Unfortunately many people do. It's the reason why some people find it hard to get up some mornings. It's crucial to one's self esteem to understand that feeling worthless is a lie.

Before we can work on this feeling let's take a look at some reasons why many of us feel this way.
The Media
We are bombarded with images from the minute we wake till the minute we fall asleep. And sometimes we dream about those images, so it does not stop with sleep.

We are told who we should be, what we should wear and how we should think. You see it in commercials, television shows, movies, magazines and newspaper ads.

Don't get me wrong I love watching some shows. They provide a good escape when you need it. But I often times get knocked back to reality, when I realize what I am seeing. For women it is often worse. It is portrayed that if you are not as skinny as a twig you are not beautiful.

Fitness is huge in terms of self esteem, but some of these images are just not attainable and leaves us feeling worthless. Men have it bad too, when it comes to body images. If you don't have the perfect body, you are left to feel like you are not good enough.

Anorexia is very real to men as it is to women, but we will discuss that in another article.

We see what we are supposed to look like everywhere. It's hard to combat such relentless imagery. Our body image is affected by these images more than we know.
Our Economy
Another biggie is career and money. It seems if you are not making 50 million dollars a year you are not successful. Our world's current economy is based on money, so it is understandable why this mindset exists. We all would like more money so we and our families can be more comfortable.

(This one I struggled with for years and in some ways still do.)

Money unfortunately is the cause of all the poverty in the world. I have my own views on our current economy, but we will save that discussion for another time.

""Money isn't everything, but not having it is,"" unfortunately.

In our society, the more money you have the happier your life is supposed to be.
How We Deal With These Feelings
To combat these horrible images that we are confronted with everyday, we must understand why they are there and who made them.

Take commercial images for example, like on television, print and internet ads. These multimillion dollar corporations are the ones putting together campaigns because based on their research this is what they think we want to see in order to buy their products.

Feeling worthless because you want to be like the fake contrived airbrushed images is not worth your time and energy. We are who we are. Remember you are beautiful. These companies just want you to feel bad about yourself so you buy their crap that you don't even need. Love yourself!! :)
Be with people that accept you for who you are. Getting positive reinforcement from real people that you actually like can be very powerful.

I am such a big supporter of having positive people in your life. It makes such a difference. Imagine how hard it would be to try to be positive and love yourself with people all around you being negative.

Please get rid of negative influences in your your life. They can really amplify you feeling worthless.

Block out the nonsense from the outside and get in touch with who you really are. You are a star, you are beautiful and unique. Remember how lucky you are to even be reading this. And if it seems hard don't worry we will work on it together.

I tell myself, ""Hey, you're 36. You know this is how life works,"" and ""She has barely known who you are since September.""

But, none of that helps. I'm not crying sad. It might be easier if I was. I just feel - blah. I have a head cold, and I used that as an excuse to stay home from work. My family things ""being tough"" is very important. They'd think it was silly and being a slacker for me to just stay home because I don't feel well emotionally. But, I don't.  
I don't want to do much except sleep right now. I'm going to work today, because I get 3 grievance days from work, and her funeral is Tuesday. I don't see myself wanting to be at work Wednesday. (I have Tuesdays off to begin with.)

Of course, then last night when I needed to sleep - I should be sleeping now - I couldn't. I'm tired, cranky, and kinda dizzy right now from the cold.  
I have no idea what anyone can actually say that will make me feel better, but maybe actually ""talking"" about it will help.  


**TL;DR Grandma died, and I feel in a funk I can't shake.**

Saturday: And I just found out my great uncle Jack died from pneumonia Thursday. (He lived in another state.) And my grandpa on the other side is in the hospital with pneumonia. They're getting him better so they can put a burr in his skull and drain some sort of fluid or blood on his brain, and figure out why it's there. They won't let me go see him, because I have a head cold. :(  (Grandma died basically from old age, but the catalyst was pneumonia.) This week just gets better and better.

I honestly think if I wasn't leaving, we'd stay together until we graduated, and would end up getting married (or maybe not xD I know it's a bit of a crazy thought, but that's how serious we are). Now I'm sad for ending our relationship like this, but happier to be going back home.

Met a girl when I was 16. Lets call her B. We started dating, and she was my first real relationship. We both lost our virginity with each other, we did everything together, we were best friends. We spoke about how we never wanted to lose each other, and how much we loved each other. She helped me through an eating disorder that was a really dark part of my life. She was my rock. Every important memory in my adult life so far was spent with her. Driver's license, prom, graduation. I decided to cut off my plans of entering the military just so I could go to college with her and make this relationship last, because we were seriously happy and I was sure there was no way I'd ever lose her.

We got through our whole first year without any struggles, and we both got good grades. We practically lived with each other when we were there. I'm 19 and she is 18 now. I pretty much drained contact with most of my other friends because she was my best friend. 3 weeks ago, after we came home from college, she tells me (through a text message) that she needs time. 

I decided I'd give her the time she deserves, but it was really hard. There were so many emotions running through my head, and I just didn't want to accept that I might not ever be with her again. There isn't anyone else. She wouldn't really give me any answers for three weeks, and she gave me hope that we could get back together. Tonight she just told me that she thinks we should just be friends. She said I was such an important part of her life and she doesn't want to permanently cut contact. 

I feel so betrayed, so hurt, and so low. My eating disorder is back full blast, and I feel so alone. I'm having a hard time imagining myself on that college campus without her, and I just don't see myself doing anything alone. I've had so many suicidal thoughts.

1369897467.0,16,self.MMFB,1fbnxd,"Over a year of ongoing unemployment and other failures, most days I don't even want to roll out of bed",17,1,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/1fbnxd/over_a_year_of_ongoing_unemployment_and_other/,"Back in May of last year I graduated from college (not going to get too specific on details). I still remember feeling really uneasy the day of my graduation. I wasn't really sure where things were going to go from there, and I still hadn't found work. I just sort of hoped that I would be able to get everything worked out as soon as possible.

At first I tried to stay optimistic, enjoy all the free time I had thinking it would be short lived. However, before I knew it the summer had come and gone, and by the time September came around, I was having a much harder time keeping any form of positive thought about finding any work that ""validated"" the last 4 years of my life and tens of thousands of dollars. Thankfully, for reasons I won't go into student loans aren't an issue, so for better or worse I didn't having any debt to start worrying about right out of school. 

The winter months saw a lot of promise that ultimately went nowhere. Lots of interviews with no callbacks, consultations with staffing firms that never tried to place me with any clients despite constant reassurance that they would contact me should they have anything to offer. 

Since the start of spring, despite continually increased effort and time in the job search, I haven't even gotten as far as an interview anywhere. I attended a course at my local community college aimed at people struggling with their careers, but it felt like a waste of time and money, as it seemed more suited towards older individuals having a mid life crisis, and the counselors running it seemed unwilling to provide me and useful advice or guidance on what I might be doing wrong.

And meanwhile many of my friends around me have had their lives move forward. A month after graduation I was one of the groomsmen in a friend's wedding, but as the night went on I felt as though I wasn't really deserving of that, I was surrounded by tons of people way closer to him, and started questioning whether or not I have been a good friend to anyone. Most of my closest friends have work, not all in the fields they went to school for but clearly a better situation than me. Meanwhile, I can't help but feel like my life is frozen in place by things not entirely in my control.

While I should at least be thankful my parents have been supportive and still willing to tolerate all of this, I just can't help but feel like a failure to them. On an average day, I don't even step outside the house. With most of my friends busy with or relocated because of their job, we don't get the chance to hang out much if at all. Finding the will to get out of bed is often a struggle on days when I have no social commitments to worry about. As time goes on it becomes harder and harder to find joy in much of anything.

Despite all of this I at least keep trying to find work, though at some point I wonder if its time to accept a job somewhere that would trivialize the 4 years of my life on a college education. I wouldn't feel great about it, and I don't think I'd be making my parents much happier. Those are issues I can solve elsewhere, but finding a job probably isn't going to make everything better.

Around the last time my last girlfriend left me I started showing symptoms of a string of psychological problems which I am just now, nearly 10 years later, dealing with through therapy and some rather strong medication. I finally felt comfortable ""getting back out there,"" and met a really great girl in class at college. She and I spent the entire class writing notes in my notebook about pretty much everything, and we spent so much time talking to each other that I'm pretty sure we both failed the class. We have basically everything in common. 

Last week, I asked her if she wanted to have lunch with me and hang out. She agreed, and we had a great time. Afterwards, I heard that a few friends were having a party at their house, and I thought it would be a great chance to see her outside of a school environment. She asked me to drive her, and on the way I was getting all positive signs. She talked about how she missed seeing me since our class ended. I saw a picnic area next to a wooded stream, and she said we should have lunch there together sometime. We got to the party and she linked arms with me to walk in. I was pretty damn happy. I kind of really like this girl.

Then it all went to shit. At around 10:00 pm, she starts yawning. Someone else at the party asks why she seems so tired. She looks around to make sure I was within earshot (I was just down the hall talking to other friends and I noticed), and she starts telling this person how she didn't sleep at all the night before because she was up all night having sex with another girl that she's liked for a long time.

Fuck.

At this point I don't know if I'm more upset because I was starting to like this girl or if I'm angry that she'd string me along like she has. I had to leave the house for a few minutes to deal with it. Was I not being forward enough? I would at least understand if she was gay; I can't exactly ask her to change her orientation for me, but she has been outspoken about being bisexual. Since she had *never* mentioned this other person before, I assumed she was just letting me know. I don't even know how to feel right now. I feel betrayed, lead on, and let down.

To start with I'm 22 and have a good job. I may not have many friends, but those I have are great and are usually always up for doing things. But sadly this isn't the issue.

My issues span from within my own family. My father is on anti-depressants after wanting to kill himself, and is not getting better. My mother hasn't worked in months and is making no money. My family is almost on the verge of bankruptcy, which would mean moving back to my shitty hometown, where I would be doing nothing and have no friends. Both me and my brother are very close, but we are both bipolar which makes some situations difficult. 

I don't really feel bad about myself, and I feel I do mean something to people, but I don't ever get any sort of respect or admiration from anyone, making me feel that anything I do is worthless... Which usually doesn't bother me, but for the past few months nothing has made me feel genuinely happy. I put on the facade that I'm happy because I don't want to feel pitied by people. I'm strong willed, but also very stubborn, and most of the time having people help makes me feel worse. 

I also try to make new friends through work and such, but most of those have ended badly because I'm insecure about myself as a person, and the last girl I tried to date, to which I had strong feelings for, decided she didn't want to continue things as she had feelings for someone else. I think that has been the most painful thing I have heard from someone. To know I wasn't good enough for someone to even try with. Sometimes I wish I could just let it all out and cry, but I seem to be incapable of doing that.

The only reason I keep going, is for my family.

I had to call my husband in tears to drive me to the hospital for an induction.  Our baby Fiona Star was silently born the next day.

I miss her so much, and this year in particular is very hard.

We choose an autopsy due to the unknown nature of her death and my husband and my desire to have more children and concern that the situation could happen again in a future pregnancy.  Her death was due to multiple placental issues, partial abruption (even with no bleeding), issues with the blood vessels from me to her placenta, ect and was not expected to be a problem or issue in a future pregnancy.  I did have completely different placental issues with my youngest as well, but that was due to placenta previa (her placenta was over my cervix).  Thankfully she only had a two day NICU stay due to breathing issues when she was first born (@ 37 weeks) and got to come home with the same day I did.

She had lived with my sister since 1998, and I have lived on my own in a different province since 2001, so our contact was restricted to a phone call several times each day and a visit every year or two. But I loved my mother, and feel like I lost a big part of who I am with her passing.

One of the hardest parts of this - harder than not being with her at the end - was that when she died, her whole family and all of her friends called my sister to ask how she was, and everybody called her on the anniversary of her death to see how she was doing.

Especially because of the last reason... the past few days I kept thinking about him instead of thinking about how I'd try to tell her. If I accepted her on the off-chance I was wrong about myself, I know I'd just make things worse.

Almost exactly 3 years ago, my then-girlfriend left me, and then committed a suicide a few months later. Hanged in the bathroom and I don't even know why. I was able to cope with her leaving, but her death was absolutely devastating. Yet somehow I was able to hang in there.

Fast forward a year, one of my two best friends tries to hang himself, which I found out about ""thanks"" to social networks. People said he didn't finish it, but I've never heard from him since and was unable to reach him.

Lastly, over the past year my another friend was struggling with depression, which was getting worse and worse. This Monday he left to a province town for a factory job. The town's got no internet and no real means of communication, so he's gone.

I just don't know what to think. The thought that this might be me and I may have a fatal influence on people is horrifying, but my relationship with them seemed friendly and normal.

All this has affected me greatly, to the point that today I've found myself unable to go on. In the coming days I'm supposed to have an interview for my dream job, which I would kill for years ago. But I don't want it anymore. With my last friend gone, I feel like I don't have anyone left in my life, no one to talk to. It's hard to explain, but both goal and motivation in life have disappeared.

I've felt depleted in the past, but always found something to hang on to. Just sitting still until mind finally shuts itself down seems like the only viable option left at this point.

1346491284.0,14,self.MMFB,z6fxm,"Found out my Fiance may be cheating, being deceitful at the very least. I just don't know what to do. It's just all too much. ",19,5,41,http://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/z6fxm/found_out_my_fiance_may_be_cheating_being/,"This is going to be a long one. I have had nagging suspicions that my fiance had been cheating. Strange behavioral things such as always being on his phone. To the point of us sitting in a restaurant, him on his phone, and me sitting there with no real conversation. I felt ignored and unimportant, especially when we were supposed to just be having a nice dinner together, just the two of us. He would do it when we were just supposed to be snuggling and watching TV. I had confronted him on many occasions about how it made me feel. I also asked what he was doing or looking at on his phone that he had to look at it so often. His answer was always reddit. 

For a long time I resented Reddit only for the reason that it was taking him away from me. I would half joke sometimes that he loves reddit more than me and there were times when he didn't even correct me even though I am sure the look on my face was of utter disappointment but then again how could he see it with his eyes on the screen? 

The behavior of not being able to leave his phone alone never really went away and I started noticing that it was getting worse. Before if I asked what he was looking at on reddit, he would show me or give a brief summary. Now it's just 'stuff'. When I ask what kind of stuff he just says comments. He also tries to 'inconspicuously' hide the screen more. For example, placing the screen facing the table during dinner so if someone were to call or text and the phone displayed a picture or information I might not see it. 

Another incidence where I noticed this was when we were just sitting down on the couch watching TV and he asked for a shoulder rub (while looking at his phone). I got behind the couch and once I did, phone went to the side, face down so I wouldn't be able to see the screen. It's because of these things I felt he was hiding something, possibly cheating. 

After a bit of fun time one night, I was walking to the bathroom in my room when his phone started going off on my desk and this time it was face up. The room was dark so I could see who was calling. It was a female I didn't know, especially since her face came up with her name and number. I thought it was strange because we do hang around the same circle of friends, so I figured I should know this girl. It was also a Saturday at 8 or 9 at night so it felt a bit inappropriate for a coworker or boss since he works a M-F,8-5 job. I asked who she was and he said 'a friend'. To which I replied 'Oh, from work?' Nope. It was a friend from reddit. He quickly and awkwardly got out of bed to ignore the call and turn the phone face down. 

It starts to eat at me and bug me. The woman calling, the attempt to ignore/turn the phone over, the fact that the woman is the same race as me and also his type. So i just flat out ask him if he is cheating on me. He says he isn't and I am fine with that answer for a while.

I start to think that if he isn't cheating then why the behavior? Why the secretive phone screen? What could be on reddit that he wouldn't want me to see? So I join reddit in secret. I remember him telling me that he likes to post his poetry up in reddit and see the comments that he gets. So I begin my search. Some submissions on reddit I see and decide that perhaps I could just make an account so I can comment and also check on what he may be doing. He never told me the username he submitted his poetry under, but I also remembered that he had texted me some poems he had been working on and posted. I eventually found his username and started to look over his overview.

I found out that he did post his poems as stated and there were comments there dating back for about three months. What I didn't expect to find was a thread in which he is playing on sexual innuendo while commenting on another user's reply. Who is it but the woman who had been calling him since her name matched his phone followed by a year. So I am also guessing it is not a throwaway account for her. She invites him to PM in the thread so there isn't any more for me to see there.

After finding this, I went through every single comment or submission only to find out more terrible news. He has been posting on r/R4R. His personal description reads like that of a dating site. Telling about his height, hair color, and the fact that he gives good shoulder rubs. It did say in the title that it M4R-platonic chats and I am relieved the only comment was from a guy. As I keep looking through the history, I notice there isn't just one of these, but several. Some of the dates started to seem a bit familiar.

I matched the dates to text messages in my phone. I also tried to remember what I had been doing a week before. Come to find out he said he needed to get home (we are not cohabiting, I'll explain later) to do laundry and clean because his roommate made the apartment a mess. That day he had posted on r/R4R that he wanted to go to a bar and get drunk because he didn't want Saturday to be over. So I found out I was at least ditched AND lied to on that day. 

I start to see a correlation between when he says he needs to do laundry or he's 'tired' and posts about wanting to go out and do things like go to the museums or see a movie. Had he just been honest and said he needed space or wanted to hang with friends it wouldn't have hurt so much. I had a male friend read his R4R posts and he did mentioned it sounded like he was looking. My friend also said that he thought the posts were inappropriate considering my fiance is going to be my husband one day. He also thought it was strange that there was no mention of me or the fact he was taken.

I'm apparently so insignificant my fiance poses as a single man. What a self-esteem booster.

Yesterday was the last post my emotions could really handle. I had called him after he was out of work and already at his place to tell him about my day. He talked to me for about five minutes before saying he wasn't feeling very well and would have to call me back a while later. Something just didn't feel right so I went to check reddit to see if he had posted anything. 

Apparently he had made plans with three other people over R4R to do something over the long weekend and they had things come up. So I read a post about how he was disappointed and that he was up for going out for drinks if anyone else was interested. This was five or six minutes at least after I hung up with him. I had to check the time because I couldn't believe I had just been lied to again. 

Telling him that I wanted to start a reddit account was my plan to see what would happen to all his posts once he found out. I told him I was going to start an account, the first questions via text were: ""Oh yeah? What do you plan to explore on Reddit?"" (Directly from my phone) 

I already had a few of his posts and his username profile page up as tabs on firefox, so all I had to do was refresh. Not ten minutes later does he call me and start to 'show me' how to use reddit. Meanwhile I start refreshing pages. I tell him I want to see how his poetry is doing and what comments people are leaving. So I casually ask for his username so I can search him. He deflects the questions by saying that he only leaves his poems up for a short period of time just in case someone tries to steal his work.

Already having been on reddit for only 4 days, I know this is utter bull because I saw poems from 3 months back. Also, as we are talking, items from his overview are beginning to disappear. Threads and comments are also saying that they have been posted by '[deleted]'. This is a red flag for me. Fortunately I copy pasted all the incriminating posts he had made before they came up as deleted. Also, I recopied the posts after the had been posted by '[deleted]' and making note of when I refreshed and found it as such. If he tries to mention it as coincidence, It really is just too much of a coincidence that it happened in less than an hour of me informing him of my intent to join reddit. 

After getting all my information together for a confrontation, I cried. My mind raced with who I could talk to about this, who could I ask for aid and them not be offended if they had been cheated on as well, how I wanted the help of someone older and wiser like a parent. I just cried even more.

My whole family never really warmed to him. My mother an aunt hate him, my dad is too sweet to care, and it would break my grandparents' hearts to know. I called my cousin who is like a sister to me, we can talk about anything and even if we haven't spoken in a while it's like nothing ever changed. The first thing she did after I told her ___ may be cheating on me was cry. She knows about how much I had to stand up for my fiance among my family. She said that it was F'd up that he could just take all that for granted. I don't know if it helps to understand the family dynamic better but I am first generation Asian American and my fiance is Caucasian. There is a lot of pressure to say the least since I am also the first born and first grandchild on that side of the family. To keep it somewhat simple since that is a bit of another story for another day, my family gave me the toughest of times because I was with him. But I suffered through it, all the back talk and gossip among the family, being left out of family gatherings, because I love him. 

I also know that if I were to go to my mother and tell her it was over, I wouldn't get a supportive response. I would get the most painful I told you so ever. My cousin also agrees that would be the likely scenario and it hurts to think about it. She also pointed out correctly that I don't want to have to monitor someone's phone or computer usage, I shouldn't have to do something like that to make sure the one I am with is being faithful.

I tend to word-vomit when I am worked up so I thought it would be best to wait to confront my fiance about it. I want to be in a clear state of mind when I do what I need to do whatever that may be. 

I don't even know if I have enough evidence to really prove anything. I feel like I've caught him but I can't be sure. Either I can't be sure or my mind doesn't want to believe what my gut and heart are telling me. I don't even know how to confront him about it. Advice on that would really be helpful. Also if you think I have gained enough to even confront him.

**TL;DR: My fiance is being deceptive, possibly cheating. Do I have enough to confront him? Also, how to confront him?**

Update: We did talk the whole long weekend and a majority of the answers I thought to expect were answers I did get. Does it excuse the lies though? No. Am I still hurt? Of course. It perhaps is naive, but I do think in general and for other people and couples willing to work at it trust can be rebuilt. Is this update a post about someone being completely and utterly forgiven? No. Trust is a keystone to a well functioning relationship and without it things do crumble. I would be lying if I said that things were fine and I was fine. He did own up to the lying, which earns respect, not to be confused with trust. I have re-read a few of my MFT textbooks and although the breach in trust in relationships can be helped through therapy, outlooks for the long term are not very high. I have been clear with him about regaining trust. I am not sure it can be entirely regained. If it can't then the answer is simple: it just won't work, the damage is irreparable. If it can, it isn't going to be overnight it could take a very long time. There may be days where the level of trust may take a few steps back from progress because of doubts placed there by lack of trust.There may be days where he is able to show me I may be able to trust him again. I'm no fortuneteller and I don't make guarantees. The comments and support here did help give me enough strength and confidence that I wasn't in the wrong, my feelings were justified, and I was deserving of answers/explanation for his actions and behavior. He has made intentions to regain trust clear but again it will take time if it can be regained at all. Especially considering he would have to work up to a level of trust I previously held for him, that of a lover/partner and not just a friend.

-Enjoying delicious food.

Even the cheapest food, ramen, is pretty damn good. We all get to eat several times a day, so we can always look forward to that!

-Warm showers or baths

It's hard to feel bad about your life while taking a shower!

-Talking to others

You may be surrounded by douchebags, but there will always be someone around to talk. People are always interesting in some ways and there's a lot to be learned for every person.

-Taking a good piss

Hell yeah

(Lost her grandmother, roommate problems, etc.) She left the second semester because she wanted to be closer to home, but we still kept in touch. (She did admit to loving me.)

We kept in contact, but on Wednesday, all contact stopped. She stopped me in MSN, removed me from her friend's list on Steam and made it so I can't even send her a message. When we last talked, she told me she lost a great friend and I said I was there for her if I needed her, no response, just logged out of IM and no message for the rest of the night. Log in and BAM, off her Steam, off everythiny expect for Facebook. She poked me last Thursday and it has just been making me feel depressed.

I don't even know how to start this. I just feel probably the worst I've ever felt in my life. I'll just write the stuff in no particular order, my thoughts are pretty chaotic right now.

I'm a 20-year-old electrical engineering student from a 3rd world country.

I recently admitted to myself that I'm gay. It will probably affect my life very much. I don't fit in the gay culture at all. I hate gay culture and after visiting gay chatrooms and dating websites, I'm kind of disgusted by all the promiscuity. I don't know why I expected it to be different, but now it seems like a projection of general popular culture.

I look awful. I have scoliosis, my teeth suck, I'm short-sighted, my face is asymmetrical. Above all that I also have arrythmia. 

The worst thing is knowing that I have brought most of this upon myself by being physically inactive, sitting in front of my computer for hours and doing that for years and years. I feel like no one will ever like me or be attracted to me.

I come from a family of refugees. My mom and dad don't have real jobs. Mom works at a local market selling stuff, and dad does nothing at all, except some house work. We lived off of the money mom earned, grandma's pension and welfare. But grandma died 2 months ago, so now our financial situation is even worse. I miss my grandma, she was the best person I ever knew. Now she is gone, too.

I started college a year ago. I'm not doing well at all. I passed some easy exams and the ones that really interested me, but the most difficult ones are still there, waiting for me. I studied very little for the whole year, and some exams will definitely have to be transferred to the next year. I'm lazy as shit. I'm addicted to reddit, and it takes so much of my time. I browse for hours without even realizing it. I waste so much time on it, but I feel like I have no willpower to stop. I don't have the willpower to do anything. I needed 3 days to finally make myself write this. There's so much stuff to study, and every day I struggle for hours to even start studying. I totally feel like a failure. I don't have a strong motivation anymore and it fucking sucks. And the distractions are everywhere. I hate myself for this.

Months went by, but I feel like nothing happened. My life is static. It's boring. I fail at college. I didn't study enough. All my days were spent with most hours being in front of the computer. Most days I didn't even go to the lectures, since I would be unable to wake up from the all-night websurfing. I failed my own, and everyone else's expectations.

I have no real friends. The ones that I do have are good persons, and I like them, but there's not much real connection between us. I don't drink, I hate clubs, so socializing is pretty hard. I thought college would be different, but people there are still pretty much the same like everyone else. I just don't like the mainstream culture. Overemphasizing drinking, sex and shallow things just infurates me. Everything is getting dumbed down. Everything is retarded. I feel like I should have been born in some other era.

Anyone have any suggestions?",16,1,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/vhbd0/with_6_credits_left_to_graduate_got_kicked_out_of/,"So after my fourth year of university, I have been kicked out due to a lack of academic achievement and am unsure of what to do.

Here's the rundown, I consider myself an okay-average student, I haven't had any problems with my grades throughout highschool and university, I've done a lot of extra curriculars and do some volunteer work as well. This all changed throughout the last year of university for me (the Winter Session of 2011-2012), as my family had come through somewhat of a crisis, having my father trying to support three international students in Canada - two of which attend univeristy, while the youngest one is nearing the end of highschool.

Needless to say my family became really strapped for cash, being the eldest of the family I decided to do my part and mid-way through my first semester I picked up a part time job. I got really caught up in attending for my family that my grades has plummeted. To help reduce costs as well I had dropped three classes in the second semester to reduce the overall costs, but even with some good grades I had achieved that semester it wasn't enough to pull my grade up.

Now this is the first time I've been put in any situation like this, with only 6 credits left to graduate - I find myself in a bad spot. Now my Canadian visa only allow's me to stay in Canada till the end of November and I have no idea as to how I should tell my parents, or pick myself up from this situation.

In hindsight I've been trying to look at this through a positive lens, and I think I can also attribute some of this to my growing distaste for my major. I had started a major in Sociology and took a minor in Law &amp; Society (was a new program they introduced in 2009), and now that I think about it - I think the only reason I stuck with it was because I found it relatively easier than most classes. Given the chance to redo everything I'd probably have wanted to pursue a degree in computer science, since it was a field I find myself leaning towards.

Anyone have any suggestions they can shed? Would be greatly appreciated.

TLDR;

* I need only six credits to graduate from a top-tier Canadian university.

* My last year my family had financial problems and I decided to pitch in

* I ended up working too much on my work work and my school work plummeted.

* To further save costs I dropped my last three classes in the second term.

* Grades didn't cut it, got kicked out. What to do now?",,False,,t5_2sjdn,False,,,True,t3_vhbd0,http://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/vhbd0/with_6_credits_left_to_graduate_got_kicked_out_of/,

This is not entirely his fault, as I'm not able to do all of the work that I had promised I would do in the house or in his or my gardens.  I have been sinking further and further into my depression and have been lying to him about taking the lithium and lamotrogine that I have been prescribed for bipolar disorder.  I have been hospitalized twice for suicidal thoughts and am starting to experience them again, but I don't feel that I can tell my father.  He says that if I seem depressed he won't let me go back to school in the fall, and I'm so close to finishing that I refuse to let that happen.  But every time I do something wrong he's really quick to point it out and I feel that he's being really hard on me and not giving me any encouragement, and while I really should be able to handle that, my self esteem and mood are so right now that it just makes me more depressed.  Furthermore, my boyfriend of nearly three years announced to me last week that he intends to break up with me after college, and I am struggling to deal with that because he is my main emotional support and I love him very much.  Also, I have absolutely no emotional support where I am currently for the summer, because I had no friends before coming to college (I was homeschooled and isolated) and no college friends live in my area.

We originally met online, later met in person while she was visiting her family (who moved here last year) and then spent a couple weeks together, acted like a couple the whole time and it just felt right. When it was time for her to leave, she was in tears for hours and we agreed that while she wasn't in the country, we wouldn't look for anyone else and would wait until she could move here. 

Everything had been great for the past few months but for the past few days she'd been acting a bit odd. She denied it at first but then today she told me she had been re-thinking moving here. She's saying that my situation is making her worried about my future and our future, and there's a guy that is interested in her who she might be interested in too and she might have a new job coming up and so on and so forth.

Not much has been going right for me for the past couple weeks, I'm hungry, I feel really alone. Because of the anxiety I don't talk to anyone from university class anymore and I don't know anyone in about a 40 mile radius.

I said that was cool, and planned an evening out with my friend.

Unfortunately my night was much shorter than I anticipated because my friend had a long day, so I went back home early and the guys were still at the apartment just hanging out and talking. I went in to say hi since I hadn't yet, and chatted a bit. They are cool guys, so I ended up staying in the living room talking with them and my SO.

I don't particularly enjoy drinking, and my SO knows that. He wanted to try the tequila he bought, so he asked who all wanted some. Then he got to me and asked if I wanted one too. I declined twice, but he insisted that I try it since I never had tequila before. So I take a shot with everyone and more conversation ensued.

After a couple of hours, they decided to go out. I wasn't sure if I should go or not since it was supposed to be a guy's night out, but it was also awkward because it was obvious they enjoyed talking with me in the group. I decided I should just stay home, so when one guy asked why I was still sitting, I told him it was supposed to be a guy's night so I didn't want to intrude. But he and one other guy insisted that I come with. I was having fun, so at their insistence I thought it was okay. They had all enjoyed including me, and even my SO insisted I take a shot with them tonight, so I got my things ready to go.

When we get out the door, my SO pulls me aside. I think his friends sense something is wrong so they try to walk on ahead to leave us to talk. He says to me, ""I thought I told you I wanted to have a guy's night."" He didn't want to tell me directly to turn around, so when I asked what he wanted me to do, he said it was my choice on whether I come along or not. Well, how awkward. I felt suddenly very embarrassed and stupid. I knew it was supposed to be a guy's night, but I was having fun and felt included already. I guess I felt stupid because I knew in hindsight I shouldn't have gone with. I told my SO to just catch up with his friends and don't mind me, I'd go home. He gave me a kiss but I don't feel better. :(

I am never really invited out by my SO with his friends in the first place so it's not like I ever force my way in on their hang outs. I think they are cool guys and fun to talk with, and I thought it was fairly obvious they thought I was cool and didn't mind I was there too.

I don't know, I just feel so embarrassed and stupid about what happened. I work from home and have been living in this new city for only a few months. I try to go out and hang out with my own friends regularly, but I think it's still not enough for me because I'm in the apartment for hours and hours every day whereas my SO goes to an office to work and gets to see a lot of people daily. I usually just hang out with my friends one on one because they aren't ""group"" people, but I think groups are nice when you get a good one together. I'm just lonely sometimes I guess. :(

I also thought by this time I'd either be in college with a major or working at something important. Instead I'm taking art classes at community college, live at home, no job, still in therapy, and worst, I don't have any friends. I'm constantly lonely.

By the time I was 15 I wanted to die, I was angry and miserable for literally years. At 15 I hit a very low point, and my life has been looking up since then, but so slowly.

I quit smoking weed, I started working harder in school, I can go a few weeks without seriously thinking of suicide. (I've been considering it a personal miracle that I'm still alive.) 

But as good as it's been, I don't have any friends anymore. Most of the friends I had (which wasn't a lot) were drug users and I want to be sober. Most of the people I knew are away at college. I'm friendly with a few people still in high school, but I feel really uncomfortable spending time with them because I can't relate anymore beyond an older sibling feeling.

The interviewers took one look at me and it went downhill from there. It doesn't matter how professionally I dress, how well I try to carry myself, it just...yeah.

I'm totally happy for them, but I can only think of myself and how difficult that even a basic relationship feels for me. I guess my post might sound FAish, but I'm seriously at a loss as to what I can do here. 

I've had one girlfriend in my life, back in 2005 when I was in college. She was my first and me being the extreme beta person I was back then, I took it way slow, she eventually got bored and left me for a ""friend"". That hit me hard for a very long time - fast forward to 2012 and it still dawns on me the knowledge that no one has ever had genuine feelings for me ever. Not once have I ever felt what its actually like for someone to be genuely excited that I'm visiting them or anything.

So I've been thinking on how to improve myself - I can't just sit here and expect things to happen. So in a rundown:

Physically - I need to drop 20 pounds maybe. I'm 5'11"", 225lbs and I feel really ugly. I haven't changed weight since my last gf, but I just feel a sense of self disgust when I get ready for work in the morning.

Career - I've finally got myself on track with a career job in my field. The money is coming and thus I should use this for confident, but I still feel a sense of self doubt.

Appearance: I've thrown out a lot of ugly clothes and adopted more fashionable style. I don't believe in trends but I try to look neat.

Its just hard though, I haven't met anyone new in a long time. My social circles are dissipated since my friends are all married - its looking hard to bring new people into our lives. At this rate I can honestly say I can't see meeting someone new happening. In terms of relationships, I feel that most girls are far too attractive for me to even warrant a shot with them - and I can't get myself in a situation to actually meet them anyway. I already feel the regret of not going through high school relationships, I feel that all I'm doing right now is wasting my good years.

I'm not sure whatelse to think right now, there's a strong feeling of helpless and a loss of hope.

Listen... I am a paedophile. Now before you bug out. Forget what you have learned from the media and read this.

I am no monster. I am an attractive (very athletic), young adult, with many friends of all ages, who is caring and loving. I am liked by most I meet. I am pretty carefree and generally happy. I have accepted who I am and I embrace it (legally). Some times though... it rips me apart inside.

This doesn't happen often, and I normally work it out myself. I just wanted to post here, for maybe some support from someone who might be understanding. I also want to let people know... paedophiles are not inherently evil. We can be good people born with a very unpopular attraction.

I am not talking about anything sexual here. That does not matter. No. I... I just want to be with them so much. Them... as in two little girls I know. One seven and one eight. Both beautiful. Both amazing. All three of us have a great relationship. Last week they came to my house. We had so much fun together. I yearn to be with them. They love my company and I love theirs. We respect each other as equals. They know I don't treat them any lesser than I would anyone else. I love them so much. I want to be able to share this. I want to tell people. I want to shout it from a mountain top. For obvious reasons... I cannot.

Now... imagine you are in love with someone. It is no different. Besides the ages. It really isn't. Luckily for me I am not an exclusive paedophile, meaning I am also attracted to adult women and can fall in love with them... albeit at much lower amounts. 

You know when you are in love? All the love songs hit home, you daydream about your love, you just want to *make them happy*.  That is all people.

Any doubters.... you can twist it in your head all you want. All I really want to do is make them happy. I want to see them smile, giggle, laugh. Don't think they don't love me either. When we stare into each others eyes, when they sneak me quick kisses and then blush. When I am there they need to be with me. They whisper in my ears ""I love you."" 

No, I am not stupid. Children change a lot, children can be much more fickle than adults. I am not the type to freak out on them because they no longer like me as much. This has happened to me twice already with two other little girls. We still have a great relationship we just aren't... in love anymore. 

Hmm well I will get over this. Regardless of how the responses are. I always do. Actually, writing this out has helped me a lot already.

I guess I am just looking to write this down, and in the process give a tribute to this amazing person in my life.

Today, on 2/2/2012, my Grandfather passed away from a long battle with cancer. This man was a pacifist in every sense of the word, and seemed to never have a negative thought or action in his entire life. I consider him the person who raised me, and taught me to be who I am today. Without him, I would be a completely different person.

This loss has me questioning everything about myself and what I believe in. I didn't believe in much to begin with, but now it seems like I have lost all faith in whatever it was I had started with. Not only am i stricken with grief but angry at the same time that it had to be him. This world would have been a better place with him in it for longer.

1328036870.0,13,self.MMFB,p4wap,"The only friend that really understood me, doesn't want to talk to me anymore...",17,4,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/p4wap/the_only_friend_that_really_understood_me_doesnt/,"The whole story and it's backgrounds are long and complicated. But I hope, no matter how long this text might be, someone reads it and has some encouraging words, an advice or eventually both.

First of all, I'm depressive, and this for a few years, I'm 21 years old. It began as a teenager (around 14 or so) and grew slowly to a real depression, that lasts since approximately 3 years. Don't get me wrong, it was never so serious that I wasn't able to go to school or work, but It drags me down. I feel like, that I were able to get better grades, if there wasn't the depression and the social anxiety. The same applies to my work.

I don't know, if this is really the case, but since it was so serious and wanted to talk to somebody, I felt like there is no one that understands me and my feelings... until February or March last year.
A buddy had a new girlfriend and we got along. One day she called and asked me why her boyfriend was so upset. We talked more than an hour about my friend (her boyfriend), why I look so depressed, and other things. It just felt right to tell her all these things and she told me a lot to. Things that she didn't even told her boyfriend. Then they broke up. At this time I didn't even realized really, that I was missing her as a friend. As I realized I was torn apart between ""cheating"" my friend and have someone to talk to. After quiet a short time, I saw her on the bus and we talked.
I was having a girlfriend at this time, and I trusted her too and felt like she was understanding me. But I talked to her (let's call her Lisa) every now and then. After my girlfriend dumped me, I was pretty sad and down for a few weeks. The first time I saw Lisa after the break-up, she noticed, that I was sad and depressed and we hung out several times talked about our lives, and our feelings (She had mental issues too, and still has in my opinion, but this is a different story.)

In the beginning of November last year, she said, she is scared of me sometimes, because I'm emotionally cold. I was deeply hurt and didn't text her anymore. If I'm sad, I get apathetic, and it's really hard to get rid of that apathy and I think this high level of my apathy and lack of emotion scared her.

I didn't saw or talked to her since last Saturday and it was kind of like she never was scared of me. I was a bit depressed, because my friend wanted to hang out with his date instead of me. Since my other friends were at work or in the army at this time, I was alone on Saturday night. One of the things that I hate the most. I had a date on the Afternoon and discovered, that it won't work out, this was not really uplifting...
I met Lisa after my date, and we talked again pretty long, rode together at home and she agreed to come over for a drink, some chatting and hanging out. Later she texted me, that her boyfriend showed up unplanned and said sorry. I was mad, but understood her.

Today I texted her, just asking how she is. The reply was... I can't find the words for it. These are the translations, I tried to be so close to originals as possible:

&gt;Lisa: My boyfriend doesn't want that I'm spending time with you. You are a negative influence sry

&gt;Me: What?! Why?!

&gt;Lisa: I'm will block you. bye

*I tried to call her*

&gt;Lisa: and don't call me

&gt;Lisa: It's not surprising, that I'm scared of you

This was just too much, I feel so much anger and I'm deeply hurt at the same time. I just feel like shit and try not to cry like a baby.

I hope this is enough to understand my situation. Thank you for reading and I really would appreciate your comment.

1327831173.0,15,self.MMFB,p1kkg,I'm at war with my own mind.,16,1,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/p1kkg/im_at_war_with_my_own_mind/,"This is something that is getting progressively worse over the past 3 years. I seem to get caught in a daydream that takes total control over my emotions and nearly paralyzes me with fear and remorse. These are memories of my past that lead up to major changes in my life. The biggest thing is dealing with my recent divorce, which I believe is a catalyst in all this. Other issues I'm still dealing with are being forced back into church by my family and the girl I was once in love with a few years back. The church issue dates back to my childhood where I was bullied constantly until it reached a breaking point where I hospitalized one of them and was asked to leave, permanently. In that case, I was framed because the kids were the pastor's own and the others (there were 5 of them) had higher ranking members in that church (deacons and what not). While there were several eye witnesses telling the story as it actually happened, they bought into 'their' story every time. I don't trust the church, and I haven't since that happened (about 9 years ago). Every time my family mentions going to church, I get stuck thinking I'll have to go back to face 'them' again, even though it is a completely different place. Fucking hippocrates. The only good that came out of this, was I opened my mind to find the lies in the church and the constant hypocracy that blinds their very souls. The second thing that haunts me, is the girl I once loved and who loved me for who I was. This was/is a high school sweetheart that hasn't changed one bit. I messed up what we had and started a very long battle with depression. When I think about what could have been, I also think of the good times we had and how badly I want that kind of love back. Everything between us was fine until I joined the Navy. What I thought would've been a smart move caused something in my thought process to come unglued. I received a text from a friend at that read 'you're not coming back to her now' and 'she chose me'. Those 2 texts made me just about loose myself. Recently when I started talking to her again, I learned that both of those texts were lies. She had the myspace messages from that time frame when he started to separate the 2 of us (he sent fabricated messages to her too about me being with someone I met in A-school). Well, in short he succeded. Karma got to him he cheated on her and the whole lie he built came crashing down. The memories of the things I said to her rattle me to my core even now, 3 years later. Not to long afterwards, I met a girl who later became my wife. The best way to explain how we got married is that we both were rebounds off of ex's we were dead set on spending the rest of our lives with. The time span went like this. 2 months after the girlfriend issue, we met and started dating. 4 months later, engaged. 6 months later (then 2009), married. Late last year, we divorced and this is why. She cheated on me twice, once with her ex from several years ago, and again with MY best friend at the time. What happened next furthered my depression almost to an early grave. After she cheated on me using my best friend, I left the house for a few hours to get my bearings straight. In that time, she called all my friends, family, and her family and fed them a lie stating that I am out currently sleeping with an old friend of mine to whom I just reconnected with (one of my most trusted friends throughout high school with the exception of my gf at the time). They all believed her. She chose my friends wisely to avoid collateral on her end. When I came home later that evening, she wasn't there. 20 minutes later, she arrived with her entire family; all pissed off beyond belief. I was labled as an emotional abuser, a cheater, a poor excuse for a man, you name it. She nor I ever told anyone about her sleeping with her ex because she didn't want her family to look at her differently. My family knew in secrecy and supported me in the forgiveness process. Anyhow, when they left, I was completely destroied. I tried calling a few close friends, and got the same story about how I'm a horrible person for doing that. I couldn't even get up for work that morning, but when I did (I was going to be half a day late), she called my work and got me fired. 5 days passed from that time, and I never once left the bed except to take a shower or to use the bathroom. On the 5th day, I decided that this world wasn't a place for me and tried to kill myself through painkillers and alchohol. I vividly remember the faint happiness I experienced as I slipped off into what I thought would've been my final sleep. I woke up 3 days later in the hospital with my stomach being pumped, my family by my side, and a long trusted friend that I was with when I was cooling down that night her family barged in on me. She didn't call him for a reason - he knew the inexplicit truth and my family knew and trusted him. I found out that he was alarmed that I didn't call him over the past week and came over to my apartment where I was unconscious and nearing my death. That was when the truth came out to all parties. She tried to reason with me and my family saying that she changed and will never to that again. I don't and will never believe that lie again. Her excuse for cheating on me and spreading the lie that almost cost me my life was ""I felt lonely when you played your xbox or worked on your car"" and ""I didn't want my family to look at me differently"". To clarify the xbox and car, I played maybe 2 hours a week and maintained my car (I owned a Camaro at the time and was proud of it). Every time I asked her to partake in my interest, she said 'no' but guilt-tripped me into doing everything she wanted to to. Yes, I mean everything. I would call into work to go baby-sit her nieses and nephews because she missed them, or we had to take them all (6 kids total) to the zoo and buy them all toys. The day I broke her control over me was damn near the best thing that ever happend to me. While the divorce was uncontested, while in theory she sold my cars (I had 2 cars, both being sports cars because thats what I liked), my gaming systems, nearly all my other belongings, and even making me quit my Navy reserve career (or else) to try to make me 'the perfect husband' for her. It's been 5 months since the divorce and I've nearly put my life completely back together. I have built up my belongings again, I own a motorcycle and restoring a classic car for myself, but emotionally, I still can't get over this. The flashbacks of her family tearing me apart, the split between the one I loved, and the church bullies seem to take control of the very core of my emotions and thought process. It hurts my body, makes my blood pressure skyrocket, and gives me severe headaches just reliving those moments every day. Since that hospital visit last year, I've been on 4 different antideperssants. I feel happier in general, but there's always something that sinks me into that thought process. All I want is for those memories to go away or stop bothering me the way that they do.

The reason was because I just don't understand how atheists can deal with death.  I was raised Catholic and used to be able to comfort myself by the idea that death will just mean Heaven or at least some kind of afterlife.  Now, I can't do that any more because I just can't think of a reason why God or Heaven would exist.  It just doesn't make sense for me for them to.  I cannot deal with the idea that death just means the end and that's it.  The end of my existence.  Like I was never here.  And then an eternity of nothingness.  What's the point of this? Or anything? Those questions scare me so much.  I guess the reasons I wanted to post it to r/atheism originally was because so many of atheists that I know seem at peace with death.

So yeah, sometimes I even have panic attacks over it, when I start thinking about it.  I go through phases that last maybe weeks where every night is plagued by thoughts of death.  I'll be fine throughout the day, but as soon as I turn off my lights or lay down in my bed, I start thinking about it and it terrifies me.  Don't get me wrong, it's not like this happens  every day of my life, but the last time this happened I almost passed out just thinking about it.  

I've considered talking to a therapist about this, it's just that my thoughts just seem to stop on their own.  Sometimes for even years.  It's like, by the time I get around to setting up an appointment, I'm okay again.  But the nights I do have to deal with this, it's so hard for me to sleep.  Sometimes I call up a friend, but the questions of, ""Why do you think about that stuff?!"" don't help.  

How to I feel better about this?

Before I lived in a crappy, tiny little apartment with my hoarding mom(boxes to the ceiling, I kid you not) and wasn't going anywhere with my life. I had tried to apply for a lot of jobs right out of highschool and never heard anything back, and with my entire family expecting me to not only be able to suddenly take care of myself, my mom, and figure out the entire fucking world on my own, I fell into a pretty deep depression and couldn't bring myself to even try anymore.

It didn't help that my girlfriend was getting sick of that depressive attitude I had and almost broke up with me over it(along with some other things.). Keep in mind she did really try to cheer me up a lot first so it's not like she's some bitch who doesn't care.

Eventually I realized I could apply for financial aid and go to college. Stupid as that sounds, my family pounded it into my head that military or a job was my only option. Lease on the apartment ended, psuedo-moved in with my girlfriend and her mom, and things seemed happier. I didn't have to associate with the family that made me feel worthless and I was starting to get back on my feet.

But money is tighter and getting tighter. I contribute what I can, but it isn't enough to keep things stable. My girlfriend posted a thread in assistance that, among other things, tells me that she feels trapped and my lack of income and ability to drive is a huge problem. The replies don't make me feel any better about it.

This is actually the second time she's made a thread like this somewhere too. Back when I was really depressed she apparently posted something on yahoo answers about how to break up with someone who may be suicidal.(I found it by accident when autocomplete suggested a title...)

I realize that a lot of these things are true and I do need to improve in those areas...It's just a blow to my self worth and I feel really down, and it's not easy for me to get back up again.

I'm 32, female, and have been depressed from age 20-21, 24-25, 28 and 30-31. There were no major life events (in fact, I have a loving family, they supported me through university as did my government, I have a good job and a nice boyfriend). They have been episodes of depression that essentially have come out of nowhere (maybe aided by autumn/winter sensitivity). 

I was just interviewed by a psychologist, I am going to participate in a study to see whether internet therapy can help with preventing ""the next depression"". But I was so relieved that I could honestly say I'm not depressed currently, that I thought I'd share. 

She also asked about my depressions, and I remember how it felt to feel guilty (for being so weak and depressed) and feeling down, and feeling hopeless and a useless person... 

And then she asked me how I feel now, and I can honestly say I'm fine again. Sure, I'm not mrs Smile, but I'm fine. I can look back at my depressions now and see I was wrong, that I wasn't guilty or weak, and that there was hope. 

So I thought I'd come here and share that hope. I know some of you may feel (and perhaps righteously so) that your situation is much worse than mine, but maybe there's hope for you, too... Have some internet hugs from me... 

Edit: forgot to mention that I feel I'm sensitive to depression, so I may feel depressed again in the future.

First post here. Before I explain the title, you have to understand the situation I am in. I am a 21 year old virgin/heterosexual male who has never smoked, drank alcohol, drugs, etc. I have seen the effects my father (and his father before him) deals with because of the choices he made, and it is my choice to not deal with that kind of stuff.  As for the virginity, it is also a lifestyle I have chosen due to my own perceptions on life and also deciding I wanted to save that special time for the right girl. This explanation is to keep out the ""go get laid"" and ""just have fun on a Saturday night"" that I am expecting to hear. On to the real story.

About me:
All my life I have grown up a quiet and shy child. Always watching people and observing their emotions and actions. I feel like I was born with this girft of observance and understanding which has allowed me to help people with their problems and point out why someone may act a certain way, give encouragement, etc.  My only brother is 8 years older than me. I have always been more emotional about things, aaaand I also like technology. I cried at the age of 6 when Bambi's mother got shot, I cried in 9th grade when my dog died and even led to me skipping school, I take words more personally than I guess the ""average male"" would, and I've had a lot of girls say I would be the perfect boyfriend because I always understand how their emotions (the ""gift/curse"" i was talking about).  My first PC was 6 years old. Windows 1995. My brother bought it and raised me around technology, which is what I went to college for. Took every computer class and aced them. I love computers and video games. Ive played hours of NES, Sega Genesis, N64, Gamecube, Xbox, Wii, Xbox 360, and PC games from 2004 on including any game from Valve, Battlefield 2, Blah blah blah you get the idea. You could say I was a geed/nerd but I didn't care. I didn't flaunt it around because I was too shy of other people and scared of what they may think.  As for my parents, my Mother gave birth to me when she was 30 while my Father was 38. Being 21 that puts them on in their years, but it hasn't stopped them from doing all they can as my parents, even though finances have been tough for several years and we ""just get by."" Trying to make this as short as possible: I grew up with the mentality to do everything unto the best of my ability. I had 4.0 in highschool, never got a detention or any form of punishment, top pick of the class from all my teachers, graduated from a technical institute within 2 years with my associates and a 3.9 GPA. The day after my college graduation I got a job and have been in it for 5 months now. Outside of my education and ""achievements"" I guess, I am a little socially awkward. Middle school wasn't a problem because it was a relatively small school with a lot of nice kids. I was best friends with all the girls but puberty hadn't hit so I didn't care about relationships, I was just more outgoing with people i grew up with. High school was a different relatively small school and I fell back on my shy, emotional habits.  Out of about 20 kids that I graduated with, I was only friends with about 5, maybe 6.  Being ""poor"" it was hard to hang out. Most the time we didn't have enough gas for me to travel to other people's houses. I didn't have internet till I was in 10th grade and we lived in a rural area because it was cheaper. All of this leads to---&gt; it was difficult to make new friends with kids far away.  I've had two best friends from my first day of school (they followed me to highschool) for 14 years now, but seeing as we have college or jobs we don't get to see each other very much.  My brother moved away when I was fairly young, so I can't rely on him that much for personal comfort, and his wife is a jerk to our side of the family. ALL of this leads to my real problem.

My Family:
My mother and I were very close. My father was too busy trying to fix cars to sell them, which meant his work hours were everyday from 7 AM to about 12 AM (give or take, as an independent worker his hours and pay were based on how much he had in the bank and who needed a car).  I hardly got to see him very much but I was always around my mother.  In 8th grade, my mother was diagnosed with 2 leaky heart valves and some form of thyroid problem that I can't remember off the top of my head.  But the 2 heart valves gave her troubles when she was subbing at my school and almost died. She lived, thankfully, but the problem left its mark on our family.  Because of the accelerated heart rate my mother has from these leaky valves, emotions that lead to increased heart rate could put her in the hospital. For the past 7 years I have been living with a hormonal time bomb and as I aged and hormones took over my body, we began to grow apart. She saw me as her youngest and does not want me to leave to marry another girl like my brother did. Essentially, my brother has great respect for my mother and how he raised her. My sister in law does not and made sure that my mother had no hand in their wedding and she also tries the best she can to keep her children away from my mother.  Granted, their is no reason behind my sister-in-law's actions. She just hates my mother... My brother doesn't like fights so he just lets his wife get away with it. The grief this causes my mother is reflected on our household. This also makes it harder for me to look for a GF because: 

1.)I am naturally shy and feint/lock up when a pretty girl talks to me, 
2.)I DO NOT want to have to deal with my mother who watches over me and judges all my friends, which just makes dating harder,
3.)I don't want to make that kind of commitment until I feel I am man enough to support my spouse through her pain as well as my own.
(When it comes to people, and girls, I act like a combination of Raj and Leonard from Big Bang Theory) 

Frankly, I feel like I should give up on trying to find that ""special someone."" I can't count the number of times that I got close to a girl, had deep discussions about feelings and such and gave them advice, started to fall for them, and get friend zoned as they use my advice to get with the guy they like. I feel used by girls and it makes me pretty bitter.  Enough about my personal life. Crap went down today.

The Problem:
The past few years, almost every day has been arguments between my mother and I about the most trivial of things. She consistently tells me I live at home for free, I have no responsibilities, and I am lazy. Every day I have about 20 chores to complete as well as ""drop everything and run"" when mother needs a glass of water or whatever it is she requests while browsing the internet on MY laptop.  Eventually I got fed up with her saying ""wash the dishes, fix the computer, dust the house, pick up the grass (from 10 acres of mowed lawn), weedwack the grass, help your dad with the cars... because Im too busy on the internet"" after I got home from an 8 hour work day at $10/hr.  For me, I just want to rest/play a video game/tinker with my computer/possibly hang out with someone...  I don't want to get fully into the details of our fights but if there needs any explanation, I'm more than willing to expound.

Today:
Last night I had a dream that a girl i knew actually cared about me. It was a pleasant dream where it seemed like everything I ever wanted was working out right.  The nightmare was waking up. I realized it was the 3rd time I had a dream like this and I began to hate my life. I was pissed and in a bad attitude. My mother (in bed) asks me to check the internet for her. I chose not to cause i was getting ready for work. She gets up after realizing i didnt check the internet and asks ""why are you running late?"" which i wasnt. My response ""Im sorry time continues to move forward when I get ready for work."" (i was tired of continually telling her that im not running late) She continues on and asks ""did you look up my stuff on my websites?"" i respond with no, she asks why, i say im getting ready, she asks why its taking so long, i respond with ""Im sorry I cant reverse time and wake myself up when YOU think it appropriate. then i could take care of myself AND do the stuff you want me to."" She got pissed, but i was pissed first.  She then starts scolding me about how i should have a routine down for these chores, a verbal fight ensues, i defend myself with reasons for what I do, my mother's heart rate escalades, she begins to yell, my father yells ""what are you fighting about NOW?!?"" and mom says ""Its just &lt;my.name.here&gt; being &lt;my.name.here&gt;."" When she said that i stormed out. She has classified ME into a negative behavior. MY persona and name has become a title of negative viewing in her eyes.  Two weeks ago she was ready to kick me out. After a 6 hour fight between my mother, father and myself, she looked me in the eyes and told me to leave her house. My dad said ""our house."" (he pays ALL the bills, she ""retired"" 4 years ago due to her medical problem) She said ""my house, you dont like it, im leaving you to get HIM out of my life."" This whole fight encompassed the fact that I didn't weedwack the lawn and pick up the 10 acres of grass by hand for the 3rd week in a row. My mother was willing to KICK me out of ""her"" house AND divorce my father because there were grass piles outside... I honestly don't know whether to blame her medical issue, the fact that one of her sisters is clinically insane and could carry over to her, or maybe even the abuse she suffered when her father beat her regularly from the ages of 3-16.
In the end, I feel like no one I talk to cares enough about my pain to give any form of smpathy.  My brother gives the typical ""that's what mom and I went through before I moved out."" I don't think he realizes that THAT DOESN'T HELP ME AT ALL!  My father gives me the ""i wish I could have been there for you more"" garbage that doesn't change the past. My friends say ""thats life man"" or ""you should hear what I go through!"" (followed by a melodramatic whine about not getting their allowance).
There is SOO much more I could get into but I just don't have the time. Im about to leave work and head home where my mother will probably greet me with a smile and be fine for the rest of the night... 


Feel free to ask questions about anything such as: 
-My crazy  aunts and uncle and my grandfather who physically abused my mother
-My crazy uncles and the early death of my grandfather on my dad's side
-My best friends and the people who have entered and left my life
-my schooling and the choices i made
-My job and the people i work with
etc
-The arguments between my mom and dad, my mom and grandma, or my mom and brother


TL;DR
One minute my mother verbally abuses me and criticizes everything I enjoy, the next she's the loving mother I once knew. Every female friend I know has friend zoned me. All my guy friends get bored with me no matter how much I try to appease them.

I started dating a girl almost a year ago. I was a senior in college, she was a sophomore. Part of that time was spent far away from each other, as she lives in the Midwest and goes to school in Philly, where I live. But all in all we have had one of the least bumpy relationships you can imagine having. We've had so much fun over that time span.

I graduated back in May. When I left, I was under the impression that I left college for good and that real life (ugh) was about to begin. Finding a job made this summer one of the most stressful imaginable, but, as the fates would have it, three months later I was offered a full-time position back at the University, just before the new fall term started. The job offers full benefits and full graduate tuition remission, which was fantastic because I desired to pursue my MBA degree. And, above all, I got to spend virtually all my time at the University my girlfriend attends. It seemed like a win all around.

The past two months, however, didn't go like that. I felt out of place among my girlfriend's friends. When I visited her, I was there to see HER, but we always spent all our time around her friends. I just feel so out of it around them. They would all talk about clubs that they were all in and events happening on campus that, as a full-time grad student, have nothing to do with me. My girlfriend would go **hours** without even paying attention to me.

The other day, I sat down and told my girlfriend that I felt depressed that I couldn't be fun around her friends all the time, not mentioning the fact that I felt ignored by her. She said that she was extremely busy all the time running clubs and was apologetic that she didn't have time for me, which I understand. But she also said that her and I are living different lives and that ""she wants to hang out with me around other people,"" because that's the way college works. That really put me off and hurt a bit, but I ignored that to her and repeated my apologies over and over.

It's been two days since then and she's barely talked to me. We usually text each other all the time, but yesterday and over the last few weeks we've been talking less and less. She's ignoring texts of mine until hours later, when she'll change the subject. I'll respond to that, and then she'll text me back two hours later changing the subject again. 

We've been in each other's lives less and less. This morning has been nothing but random bouts of crying in my office, because I don't know how to fix this when she's not responding to my texts or anything. 

The other day when we talked she told me she still loved me, but I'm just getting the vibe that she's caring less and less. 

I wish beyond wishing I could do something about it, but this relationship seems to be fading every day. I don't know how I'm going to cope if this ends...everyone always talks about how we're definitely getting married and that we're perfect for each other. For the first six or seven months everything seemed so perfect...now it's all gone to hell and I don't know how to fix it. I just want to  be with her again and for things to be like they were.

Writing this has made me feel a little better. I just needed somewhere to vent. I don't care about uptokes or anything, I just needed a virtual pat on the back because I don't think I'll be able to talk with my family or close friends about this in person yet without bawling. It's not over yet, and I fully intend to fight for her. She can't break up with me because I'm in a rut about not fitting in in college anymore, or at least I hope not. I just can't stand the thought of her not caring about me anymore.",,False,,t5_2sjdn,False,,,True,t3_lr217,http://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/lr217/i_dont_feel_cared_about_by_my_girlfriend_anymore/,

My memory is shattered, but I can put pieces back together. I need to think about this, and I need to deal with it. 

When my mother had me she was only 18 years old. I was born 10 days before her 19th birthday. So, in that respect I know that she was not ready, and I want to forgive her. The relationship she had with my father was totally based on the fact that he had gotten her pregnant. He was 25 and a DJ at a bar. She never made it past 9th grade, had no discernable skills, no education, and severely manic-depressive. When I was three, they devorced, and my mother was awarded custody, not uncommon in the late 1980's. She was 21, and her family did not want the burdon of another child to rase, and kicked her out. I remember living in an apartment with her for a while, and then she met him. 

He was an older man, late 40's or early 50's. He owned a mobile home. For income he worked construction and worked as a janitor/handyman. This all sounds good, untill you consider that he was deeply involved in the criminal world of drugs. At first life was unremarkable, beyond what would be expected from living in a trailer park. I dont remember how or when the physical abuse began, but I do remember they would go through large amounts of alcohol, and when they were drunk they were different people. Money was allways extremely tight, and my brother and I were often Limited to one meal a day, so as to ration the food out as long as we could. And one meal sometimes ment one sandwich, or one bowl of soup. That was it. I remember there came a point when the electricity was cut off, and one horrible winter which all we had to for heat was a kerosene heater in the middle of the living room. And I remember we could only afford to turn it on at night, and during the day, it would get cold enough inside for icecicles to form on the inside of the windows. I remember my mother would beat me on a whim for things that I didn’t do, and for reasons to which I am still not clear. And there was him. 
He stored his playboy magazines on the bottom shelf of a bookshelf. One day he caught me looking at them.  I remember this night vividly. He was sitting in his chair across the room, and my mother was sitting in her chair next to me. He saw what I was doing, and made me bring it to him. He put me on his lap and starting flipping through the pages. His hand wandered down. All of this was in full view of my mother, and either she didn’t want to believe what she saw, or she was too drunk/stoned to care, in any event, she did nothing to stop him. I was only 9 years old at the time, and I didn’t understand what was happening. It continued like that for a while, and eventually he would come into my bed at night. ( I had to sleep in the living room because the only two rooms with heat was their bedroom and the living room. My brother slept on the lazy boy chair, and I slept on the couch.) Anyway, he started coming to my bed at night, the three of us (me, him, and my brother) had to take baths together, because the only way to heat the water was on the stove. This all went on until my behavior at school started to become so extreme (always in fights, always in detention, suspension, facing expulsion… I was actually kicked out of my first school in second grade, and kicked out of my second school at the end of third grade.) that my teachers started to ask my parents questions about my home life. One day, as my mother was taking me to school, and in a rare sober moment, she asked me if he had ever touched me in any bad places, and I told her yes. He had. After that It gets blurry. I know that my mother told my father, and I moved to his house. I know my father wanted to kill him. But my step mom would not let him. I know that I still had to go over there for weekend visits. 

When it came time for legal action, my father wanted to put him into prison, to let the criminals deal with him. There was just one problem, in order to convict him, they needed my testimony. I was 11 at the time. Scrawny. Terrified. I remember in great detail the chair in which I was sitting when the DA was asking me to tell her what he had done. I remember they handed me a doll, and asked me to show them. I cried. I threw the damn thing across the room. I curled up in a ball under her desk. 

He walked out of the court room a free man.
Fast foreward several years. Fresh out of high school, my only job experience was working as a bag boy for a grocery store. No discernable skills. A high school deploma worth only a little more than the paper it is printed on. No money. No family support. (my father was drowning in his own debt, and could not afford to send me to college, and I was smart enough to know that I did not want to fall into the student loan trap) so the only option I saw was the army. So like the person I am, I just dove into that head first, without a clue what I was getting into. All in all that worked out well enough, right up until shortly before my 21st birthday. How she got my number I will never know, but she called. 10 years, and I don’t hear a thing from her, and she called. Told me she wanted to see me. So she drove half way across the country to do it.

I've been diagnosed with a slew of disorders and depression stemming from childhood abuse (and being a clever kid, I kind of learned the twisted lessons abuse gives all too well). The whole ""man up and get over it"" caused me to be a combat soldier. It was hell, but I made it. After that, it was drugs and alcohol. A lot. I tried fry my misery out of my brain. That lasted for years... until I met the only woman I have ever loved, and quit it all for her. Then my mom had cancer, I was at her side more than anyone else - so she wouldn't have to fight it alone. The drawn out battle with cancer ended up destroying the only romantic relationship I had... and ended the only time in my life when things were manageable - what I equate to happiness. I powered through all my problems to be there for my mom, when I'd get home I would be a wreck, and at some point alone with my problems and the image of my mom's chemotherapy-withered body, as I cleaned the vomit from her face.

After she recovered, she said I wasn't as positive about helping her as others in the family were. That all my fuck ups and misery were my fault, that I was self-centered, and a terrible son. Needless to say, shit like that throughout my life keeps on devastating me. Now, I have crippling social anxieties. I am terrified of people. I am in my mid-30s, with graying hair. I have a few friends, none of them any help. I rarely leave my home. I minimize contact with the outside world. Every day, I want to crawl up and die. But that would hurt my little brother - the only one in my family to ever look up to me... the only person that has ever loved me as much as I loved in turn.

I'm the eldest of three children, and for my entire life, I have been singled out as the throw away..... the bad child. I remember back when I was little, my parents getting angry at me for no reason, and the hours of yelling, screaming, and hitting I endured from them. It didn't matter whether or not any of my siblings were involved, or if it didn't include me whatsoever. I always got the blame for anything that happened. As I grew older, I guess my parents figured out that if I ever told someone that they hit me (Hits, kicks, throwing me up against walls/cabinets), then their life would be that much harder. So they just started treating me as the family outcast. The unloved child. They would take my brother and sister to go do things any youngster would do. I always was forced to stay home. Whatever my siblings wanted, they got (I come from a rich family). I always got the minimal. My siblings would get music lessons, pottery classes, sports, whatever you name it. I have never been able to do anything other than volunteer work because my parents don't want to pay, or drive me, or whatever their excuse is. My siblings have gone to private schools their entire life and chauffeured around while I was forced to go to public school and ride the bus. Until I was a freshman in high school, they refused to buy any clothes for me, so I wore my male cousins hand me downs, which wouldn't be so bad if I hadn't been the cast out girl in the corner at school dressed in hoodies and camo pants. Because of this, I've never been able to go to a friends house, play sports, so I've ended up a social outcast, even as a senior. I can't get a job because we live out in the boondocks where there is no way I can get a job and/or commute anywhere without my parents driving me. So I've always been money-less, friendless, and a nobody.

All the while my parents are spoiling my other two siblings, giving them whatever their heart desires. Clothes. Camp. School. Support. Love.

I'm not a bad person. I've never done anything that they could be angry at me for. I've never done drugs, drank, threatened them, stood up to them, defied them, destroyed something.... I'm a nice person. I have a few friends who see past the dark cloud that hangs around me. Nobody else sees anything wrong with me. Just the people I live with. 

I guess I've just had it. I'm lying on the couch after just another session of mental abuse, them promising something and then yanking it away right before I'm supposed to get it.... I'm too stupid to get a drivers license. They said they would take me in tomorrow to schedule for a drive. And they told me half an hour ago that they've changed their minds, I'm too stupid. 

And I've decided that I have no reason to live. Why should I be alive? Nobody loves me. I have nothing to live for. Every dream or goal that I've ever had has been shot down.

I guess if I'm too stupid to get a drivers license, I'm not worth having around. 

I'm sorry if you wasted your time here.... I often hold out hope that one day they'll come to me with their arms open and just say that they were sorry. That's all I would need.

Take this girl I met last week for example. We met at work, she told me how she just broke up with her exbf. Told me she was feeling bad all her friends were getting married, and she is the only one staying single. For some reason, it felt as if she was giving me hints, but I was mistaken. Sent her an email the next day telling her I found her interesting, and would love to have lunch with her at work some time. Nothing. No response whatsoever. They always answer my emails till the point I ask them out, and they simply don't respond (that wasn't the first time)

He refused to take heart medicine after he lost the business, and the final years of his life he was basically waiting around to die.  He was working a menial contract delivery job, and used the money he earned to give me spending money, buy cigarettes, and buy junk food.  

I still miss him, though, even though his poor financial choices almost broke our family.  He was the goofiest person alive and knew how to make me smile when I was stressed from school or my job.  

He passed away 8/2/2010.  I saw him July 30, 2010 for the last time.  We went to pick him up to drive him up to KC, MO from Texas for my sister's wedding.  When we got there he said he couldn't go.  I was furious, I thought it was from his mental instability and anxiety associated with long-distance travel.  I walked out of the apartment while my fiance talked to him, but something inside me told me to go back and tell him how much I love him and hug him

Looking back, he must have known.  That was the last time I saw my father was the first time I saw him cry.  The entire time we were in KC, my fiance and I had the feeling we'd come back to find him dead, but not from heart attack.  We thought he would kill himself.  When we got back to the apartment on 8/2, I conveniently went to check the mail while my fiance went to check on my dad.  As I was walking up to our building, my fiance comes rushing out, phone in hand, giving me the ""STOP RIGHT THERE"" hand sign and look on his face.  It was the longest night of my life, and I was still convinced it was suicide.  It wasn't until I got the death certificate a few weeks later that ""atherosclerotic and hypertensive cardiovascular disease"" became the most relieving words I had ever read.

I've known her for almost 6 years. She was the kind of girl I was okay to cry in front of. So yes I was friendzoned before I even liked her. It all began last summer. She was away for a month and we hadn't seen each other at all. She asked me to meet her on the first day of school and I agreed. It wasn't really a school day because my university always had an orientation day for the first years. 

*Autumn fell.* I met her and she gave me a hug. It was soft in the beginning but she tightened her arms as we hugged. It was different than all the hugs I have received. So we talked for a while and I decided to go home. There was a lot more opportunities to meet up after school began. I left school feeling warm and cozy. School soon started and we saw each other from time to time.

She was busy from her housing duties and I simply was taking 7 courses at the time. But we still found time to meet and hang out one on one. 

*Winter fell.* It snowed on a particular November Saturday and I was around school area where she lived. So I texted her and we met again. She was running a bit late so I was standing in the snow waiting for her to come. The mean time I contemplated about the fact that if I actually liked her. Yes I enjoyed her company and she was everything a guy like me can dream of. And my heart had its reason my mind knew nothing of. 

She soon showed up and we began to walk across campus to sit down for breakfast. On the way she told me I was ""so funny"" and all. I thought that was good and kept pumping jokes and charm.

It ended well and we hugged good bye in the afternoon. It was already sunny. My friend called and a lot of us went up to the mountain to watch the sunset. They asked what I was doing earlier but I was reluctant to provide information. I was still wondering about her and where this can go.

I had a peaceful Christmas, and second semester had started. I moved into the dorms she lived in. It all went well and all. She was 2 floors up. We shared meals and moveis and even work out but times were as innocent as the morning dew on a thorny rose. I soon was driven deeper and deeper into this friendship.

I was grateful that I had a close friend like her and also terrified of the feelings I had been developing for her. I was terrified. Some mornings I'd wake up an hour early and wonder about her until the sun came up. There were weeks when I could barely focus on my studies because she was on my mind always.

It soon got too out of control so I text her and called her and visited her even more. It might have been selfish but I couldn't help it. She gave me strength to fight through my heavy course load and worldly problems. To my surprise she agreed to see me almost every time I asked her. I was scared.

So scared.

*Spring fell.* It was finals season again. Classes were done. So I studied with her every day. She had her problems too. One time, after a long day of studying by myself, I called her and asked if she wants to go for a walk. She said okay but she needed a minute. She then called me and told me that she wants to talk about her problems with me so I said that's fine.

I waited downstairs, and she showed up with and upsetting posture. She hugged me again and started crying and we ended up speaking until very late. 

I was scared. She's a friend of mine, but I have developed strong feelings for her. A part of me wants to just go for it but the other part said wait.

I waited.

Our friendship got to the point where we would share anything with each other. It was the kind of friendship I had never had before. But I liked her and it was consuming me slowly and softly like the flame to the candle. I thought that I loved her and I would do anything to keep her out of harm. My God was I crazy for her.

I guess I still am. Maybe that's why I'm drunk..

*Summer fell.* She went on a trip to the east coast to see her extended families. I couldn't wait anymore. I decided to ask her out and settle the deal when she comes back. I waited and waited. Her return date got delayed and it missed my birthday by a few days. I was slightly upset but I was still cool.

Finally she came back and I wished her welcome back as soon as she landed. That was Monday.

Then I finally summoned my courage to ask her out today, but before I could have said so, she told me she's now dating a family friend in the east coast. I was devastated. I thought I was hallucinating for a moment but it was somehow very real.

It's the real world now. My mind is clear as the glacial waters. This dawn is brighter and more brilliant than ever. This is me. A young male adult who didn't seem to be bothered by almost anything - devastated. 

Earlier today, at work, I told a friend that I might not be here in this particular city 4 years from now. I suddenly realized how probably this actually can be. 

So here am I. A disappointed idealist trying to get by. I don't feel sorry for myself. No, that isn't me. I am always optimistic and happy. I know this will either make me or break me. I just need time.

I did not see him consume the amount of alcohol he had (He supposedly had 22 shots of Absinthe and Tequila). No one cut him off, even though we knew he had way too much. He started playing a drinking game with a girl at the party, and she has a super high tolerance for alcohol. Roughly 40 minutes later he was super drunk, and slightly vomiting outside. We were watching him, getting him water, and trying to get him to puke. He puked some...but not enough :/

Later on he passed out, and everything seemed fine. He was breathing, and his pulse was regular. I checked this roughly an hour and a half before 911 was called. I am not a trained professional, but I thought he was going to be fine, and the others thought so as well. Some people there we not drinking at all. 

Someone was with him the whole time he was asleep. Two hours after he drank the person watching him noticed he stopped breathing. Two people there immediately did CPR.

Also long story inside MMFB,17,4,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/hrl6z/athiest_who_believes_in_abstinence_pretty_much/,"Well, let's start with a bit of history of me. For as long as I can remember being able to talk and think on my own I have never believed in a god. I have never trusted easily and do not care or trust anyone currently, and haven't trusted many people in my life. I have had a LOT of shit happen to cause this. Since pretty much 14 or 15 years old (when a lot of people I hung around with started sexing it up and all that) I have believed in always waiting for someone I would be willing to marry. Not necessarily marriage, just someone I would be willing to marry. So kind of abstinence &gt;&lt;. I also will only be with someone who also believe what I believe and is waiting. It's just the ultimate giving of trust to your S.O. imo. Anyway, my beliefs cause me quite a lot of grief because I cannot meet anyone else that believes the same as me. I am 23 years old and every day I lose out my chance even more. No females around my age believe what I do, and none have waited. I catch a lot of flak from friends who say my beliefs are dumb. I hate my beliefs but I cannot change them. I have friends that also respect my beliefs quite highly. I should also mention that quite a few people (including general doctors) have said I should go to a psychatrist (or whoever it is that deals with it) because they believe I have asperger's syndrome and severe depression.

Anyway, now for the real story: I have only ever met one person who believed what I do. Except she was kind of religious still, but I was fine with it. She was perfect in every single way to me. So many of the same interests, always getting each other interested in stuff. Geeky girl. Funny, smart, witty, beautiful. So many other things I could go on saying was good. It ended up being a long distance relationship, but we were fine with that. It went for 3 years (crazy for long distance right?). I never cared for anyone before, or trusted anyone before like I did with her. Suddenly one day she says ""forget about me"" and that was the last I heard from her. This was about a month before I was to go out and visit as well. She ignored everything I did to try and get in contact with her and I didn't go out there obviously... This was almost a year and a half ago. Yesterday I talked to a friend who told me that he had talked to her about 6 months ago and she said she had cared for me when she left me for various reasons. I decided, since I believed I had fixed all these reasons to call her. After much nervousness I finally got a hold of her. Except she wouldn't talk to me, she had her friend talk to me. A year a half later. I learned in this past year, she abandoned all her beliefs. She went and got pregnant (and then apparently lost the baby? Idk if it was before or after birth). And then she told her friend to stop talking to me. And that was it.

It shouldn't really matter to me anymore after so long, but this was someone I cared for and trusted and would do anything on this planet for... and she abandoned her beliefs that I am so obsessed with for some reason.

I don't really think it was my fault (I'm still confused, the events leading up to impact are still blurry, but what I do know is that I'm careful to the point of paranoid when I drive and I don't feel I did anything wrong). 

However, I received the citation for it. I got hit on my driver's side just shy of where I sit at a high enough mph that my side airbags deployed and my ears were ringing after my car got sent swinging to the side in the rain, and I had to deal with the hysterical girl who hit my car sobbing about how she was sorry and how she didn't see me or have time to stop because I ""came out of nowhere."" 

Fortunately I wasn't hurt and neither was she, but I'm in the middle of some other really rough life events and the timing of this was awful. My car had to be towed and I went home to spend the night alone because my boyfriend didn't have a means of getting to work the next morning. 

Then, today, after going back and forth with my insurance about which body shop that my car can be taken to, my computer power cord shorted out. 

I thought to myself that it would be okay, I'd get a replacement tomorrow. 

Shortly after that the drawer in my desk at work fell apart and came crashing down on my foot, knocking a brand new phone out of my hand and rendering useless after it hit the floor at just the right angle from less than 3 feet off the ground. I already paid $150 for it, I'm now out an additional $200 to replace it when I already have to worry about the deductible for my insurance from the car accident. 

I know worse things happen and I actually feel extremely lucky to have escaped unscathed from the accident, but I'm overworked and exhausted and at the end of my rope from other life events that I can't share, so these three things happening in succession...it's really throwing me for a loop. I'm broke now and in a few minutes when my laptop dies I will have zero contact with anyone I consider a friend until tomorrow morning.

Computer is dying now so I may not see comments immediately. But I'd love to hear from someone... anyone? Please?

I've been depressed for the past couple years because of some self-esteem issues and whatnot, but now I'm starting to think that I also have a drinking problem.  When I drink, too often I get blackout, and I wake up the next morning wanting to die from embarrassment and anger.  I've spent so many mornings crying in the shower and hating myself, but its never been enough motivation to make any positive changes.  Sometimes, I don't even do anything that embarrassing.  Other times, I'm a mess.  But no matter how terrible, I just never stop getting blackout.  I've done some outrageous shit when I'm intoxicated, stuff that legitimately mortifies me looking back on (and always will I suppose), but it just keeps happening.  

Case in point, on the 4th, I was lucky enough to spend the evening with someone I'm very fond of, only for me to get sloppy drunk and blackout.  My friends say I was fine, just drunk, but I feel so ashamed and just mad at myself for blowing this chance to connect with someone, and letting them see that side of me.  And now whenever I see pictures of fireworks, or talk to people about the 4th, all I can think about is how my drinking has once again ruined me, and how terrible an opinion my friends must have of me because I'm always getting blackout.  

I've sought professional help, but it hasn't really worked.  If anyone here has any advice, it would be much appreciated, but I mostly just wanted to get this off my chest I guess.  

TL;DR: I get blackout drunk all the time and hate myself and what people must think of me because of my drunkenness, no matter what I said/did the night before

It feels like a never ending black tunnel that I've been going down for the past three day's.

It was a long night. I sat at my firehouse on call. We get hit out for a motor vehicle accident with confirmed entrapment. I run to my gear rack, throw on my bunker pants, grab my coat and helmet, and sprinted for the door of the first response truck.

As I buckle my seat belt, I think of my girlfriend, who I had known since I first moved into town. She was my first friend. And later on became my best friend.
I was brave enough at the time to come out and I told her that I was bisexual. Ironically, she told me the same thing. And she also told me that she had liked me since she first saw me. 
We did everything together, but enough of that

I sit in the seat of the first responding truck and wonder ""what poor soul ended up in this accident?"" but I did what I usually did.
The first responder filled up and off we went. We arrive on scene to a car embedded into a tree. I didn't really think much of it, but I went straight to work.

I run around to the back of the truck and grab the hydraulic pump and the large cutters. Another guy grabs hoses and a generator light and we rush to the car. I'm about 10 feet away as I start up the pump, and run to the driver side door.

Nothing in my entire life could prepare me for what I was about to see.

I looked through the window, and I froze. A few seconds after, I started working as fast as I possibly could while bawling my eyes out. Eventually my chief ran up and tried to pull me away, but being that the person in the driver seat was my own girlfriend and my best friend, I fought back, and continued to  cut apart the car to get her out.

I stand there for about several hours with a 40 pound hydraulic rescue tool in my hands, we cleared enough space to get her out. As I handed off the cutter, I grabbed for a back board, and begin to secure her to it. When she got secured to the board, we ran to the ambulance that was on scene. I jumped in the back and prep her for transport. The EMT's tried to push me out of the rig, but I said to them ""she's not going anywhere until I'm on this rig"". They didn't want to argue, so they got ready to drive what was probably the longest half hour of my entire life.

As we speed to the nearest hospital, the lifepak read her heart flat lining. So as an ambulance is speeding down the highway, I do CPR while crying at the same time. Every compression was like me taking a bullet to the chest. It killed me to see the girl that I love sooo dearly lose her life in front of me.

As we arrived at the hospital,  we rush her out the back of the ambulance, into the hands of the trauma team waiting outside emergency arrivals. As they handed off the stretcher, I wouldn't let go. The head of the trauma team peeled me off and I stood there as they rushed off  with the girl I loved. I didn't even shed a single tear.

As I say in the waiting room, The doctor walked up to me and said ""she died while you were on your way here. I'm sorry"".

from that point, I fell to my knees sobbing while my chief just arrived hearing the date of my best friend and girlfriend.

I just lost the person I cared for the most in the entire world, only because I loved him and he just wanted to be friends. The worst part is that if I ever contact him again he will call the police.

I am in my 20s, gay, male, from South America, he's in his 50s, from USA. We met about 2 years ago in a cam website, since then we developed a great friendship, and then I fell in love with him. It was great on the beginning because it seemed like he had a crush on me (and he admitted later that he, in fact, did). Sometimes we would spend hours a day/night talking to each other on Skype, we would send e-mails, good morning messages, pictures that would make us smile, talk about our days, etc. It was just like a regular relationship, but from a distance. It was just such a beautiful friendship, but I wanted more. I wanted to develop a real relationship, I wanted to meet him, I wanted to date him. He said and made me believe maybe we would meet someday even though he didn't think he would ever fall in love with me, I wish I could just meet him, that would be enough, I don't want to die without meeting him in the ""real life"". I never did and I don't think I ever will and this is killing me.

Back to a year and half ago I started to found out he was telling me lies, and that's when our friendship started to get bad. I also started to get very jealous of his friendship with other people. Then we started to have arguments all the time, and when I say all the time I mean ALL THE TIME, every single day for the past year we've had an argument. We would get angry, yell, get sad, cry, and then make up again, on a daily basis.

I asked him to stop broadcasting in this website, and he said he would, but then I found out that he was broadcasting in another website, and then I started to find out more and more lies. The jealousy and demanding started to grow, I asked him to stop talking to the people he met on these websites, and he said he would and made an Skype account with only me on it, for about 6 months I believed that was true but later I found out he was still talking to them, but using Yahoo instead of Skype.

I would ask him questions that he would say it wasn't my business, but that's just because he was lying. Like who he had dinner with, what he have been doing for the past X hours, etc. Sometimes it were just regular questions like ""how was your day? what did you do today?"", and he would get upset, not wanting to answer me.

I told him I fell in love with him and that's when things went from bad to worse. He said he knew and that explained the demanding and jealousy, but that he didn't think he could fall in love with me.

He could be very cold, I used to tell he did not know how to love, and he would say ""maybe you're right, maybe I don't"". It was just very cold and hurtful.

The first time I said ""I love you"", he said ""Thanks"", but with time (and after me asking him to) he started to say ""I love you too"", but I felt he didn't mean it.

Recently things got really, really bad when I broke into his e-mail. I managed to make a website with a fake g-mail log-in page and that was the worst mistake I've ever made. I got his password, I logged into his e-mail and I saw many things, I found out many lies. He was so hypocritical, he would tell me a lie, and shamelessly expect me to believe it, and he get angry at me for not believing it. He wanted me to believe a lie, and he would yell at me and argue with me if I didn't.

On his e-mail I found out all sorts of things, including a lot of lies he told me. With access to his e-mail I also broke into his Yahoo, AOL Mail, Skype, Facebook... I found out many many things that made me get so furious, so angry, so disappointed that I did another horrible mistake. I threatened to put some private pictures and conversations on the internet for all his friends and family to see, of course I would never do that to him because I loved him so much, but I was just so angry that these words came out of my mouth without me thinking of what I was saying. For the past two weeks I broke into his e-mail about 4 times. On his e-mail I also talked to two people pretending to be him, his ex-assistant (which he had done things with about a year ago, and probably did more things recently but never told me). He kept hitting on my friend asking him to ""drop his pants down"" and to do stuff with him next week when he gets back from his travel, and when I told him it was another person in the account this guy (the ex-assistant) got angry I guess. The very next day he went on my social networks to call me a ""motherfucker"".

I also talked to another guy, from Singapore (Another ""crisis guy"", as my friend mention us, this guy from Singapore fell in love with him too, and the same thing happened, jealousy, arguments, etc... Same thing happened with another guy from Poland... Now tell me, all this things in common, is it too much coincidence? Are we ALL wrong and he is the right one? Sometimes it felt like he liked going online looking for guys online to play these ""games"", make us fall in love with him just to stroke his ego, and then say goodbye).

Anyway, after he found out I had broke into his e-mail and all that he started to get angry, sad, annoyed, and so did I. He ended up telling his friends and brother the issue he was having with me. I guess that this is what made him say goodbye.

Everything seemed to be getting better though, even though we were still having arguments, we were still talking and managing to smile sometimes. But about two days ago we had an argument and I said ""Go ahead, hang up now if that's what you want, I'll go and break into your e-mail again"", but I DID NOT DO IT, I hung up and went to sleep.

The very next day he messaged me saying he had deleted his e-mail and that he lost years of jobs, all his clients contacts, all his YouTube videos, his Flickr page, etc etc. I text him but he didn't answer me, he also didn't answer the phone, and he had deleted his e-mail so I had no way to get in touch with him. So I went to his personal (business) website, and as I knew the password I logged into it and added a message on the main screen asking him to contact me because I knew sooner than later he would see that, and that's the only way I could have him know that I wanted to talk to him. But that was the straw that broke the camel's back.

He texted me saying to fix his website and stop doing this and ""give his life back"", he said he had contacted the FBI to ask about what he could do to stop me from breaking into his stuff. I was shocked, I didn't mean to do any harm, I didn't mean to make us get to this point. He said he didn't want me to contact him ever again, and that if I did he would do something, he was the one threatening me now. Today he talked to me on Skype, I could not stop sobbing, he was cold, he was angry, he was furious, I kept asking him to give me a chance to fix this but he said ""no"", he said he did not want me to contact him again, he said he told his friends about what I did, and that his ex-assistant said that he was going to call the police on me if my friend didn't do it, my friend asked him not to, I don't know what will happen. I didn't mean to hurt anyone, I just wanted to be friends with him because I love and care about him too much. I wanted to fix our friendship but he is not willing to do that anymore. He said then that he might give me another chance IN A YEAR from now, and if in a year he thinks he can forgive me, he will try, but that I do NOT contact him in less than a year or he will do something against me.

I just can't live like this, I like him so much, I am willing to try to look at him as a friend, not as a lover, but he doesn't want me to try, he said I can't do that, but I think I can, but now it's too late, he said goodbye, I don't know what to do, I want to try, I'm desperate, I've wanted to die. He said I was killing him and that if he didn't say goodbye to me we would both end up killing ourselves, I don't think that is true. He said he was afraid of me breaking into his e-mails again, he made a new e-mail. He asked me not to look up him on the internet, not to go to his website, not to look for him on cam sites, he asked me to delete every picture I have of him. He asked me to forget about him, but I don't think I can.

I just don't know what to do. I want and need to regain his friendship, and even though it seems impossible I want to try. What can I do? He told me not to contact him again. God, I don't want to live this life without him on it.

**Sorry for the long text, but I'm just frightened, sad, depressed. I want his friendship back. He was one of the most important persons in my life, I don't have many friends, I'm depressed, anxious, maybe bipolar, closeted to family and the few ""friends"" I have, I was so shy and this man helped get through my shyness, he helped in many way, he helped me accept who I am, he was just the greatest friend I ever had and now I've lost him because of my jealousy and love that I had for him. I need to talk to someone I guess, I don't know. I want him back into my life. What can I do? :(**

I know there's probably a way out, but I'm too depressed to see the forest for the trees.  Here's where I'm at.

I'm a married guy with young kids.  I'm the sole breadwinner in my household, and we live in Southern California.

I used to be a Mormon, but a couple of years ago I came out as  ""disbeliever"" to my family. This led to me being essentially disowned by many family members and friends. For a time my in-laws tried to pro-actively break up my family. My wife at time expresses disappointment that I'm not an active believing Mormon.

It's expensive to run a family where I live, and I'm stuck in a job that requires I work essentially around the clock to support my family.  I've been searching for jobs elsewhere, but nothing can match it in terms of pay.  And even though I make good money, all of my money is spent on feeding, clothing and educating my family.  We live pretty much month to month.

Because I work so much, I don't have much time for friends or hobbies.  I used to work out at a local boxing gym, but the changes to the family budget forced me to cancel my gym membership.  I still work out every day, but even that daily morning dose of endorphins isn't enough to make me happy like it used to.

I'm aware that it was my choices that led to my current life, and that leads me to hate myself even more.  I'm responsible for my current misery.

I've thought of several ways to end my life to ""beat"" my life insurance suicide clause, but I've never gotten past the first phase of the plan.  
What stops me every time is thinking about how bummed out my kids would be if I weren't there, especially my son.

But the reality always hits me - I could get my family out of debt and fund all of their futures immediately if I ended my life.  And I could also end the current hell that's swirling around in my head every minute I'm awake.  

I know there's a way to break out of this cycle of self-hatred and depression, I just can't seem to find it.  ",,False,,t5_2sjdn,False,,,True,t3_1fomka,http://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/1fomka/depressed_guy_who_should_probably_not_feel/,

It had been in the back of my head for years, but for the past 6 months, I have been thinking about it a lot. I talked with my friend who is openly bi, and she said I should just go on OkCupid and find some guys to date. She was the first person I told. I already had an account, and changed my orientation. Then, for some stupid reason, I posted about it in /r/bisexual along with a picture of my face and username. I know my friend browses /r/bisexual, and this post got over 200 upvotes. Please, nobody link to that post if you have it.

So after 3 days of messaging guys, I suddenly realized that I have never had sexual fantasies about men. I tried masturbating to gay porn, but couldn't. I don't know how the fuck I managed to convince myself that I was bi. I deleted the reddit post, my account, and my OkCupid account. But my friend must have seen it, because it was the top link of a subreddit she frequents. And I told my sister I was bi. Nobody else.

It would have been ok if I hadn't posted that picture. What the hell was I thinking? I guess I just wanted the attention. But even when I was reading that thread, I was hoping that every comment was from a girl. And when I was on OkCupid, I suddenly didn't want to message any guys. Every message I got, I hoped it was a girl. I think I want to be bi because it would make me interesting. It would make me unique. And, more importantly, it would give me a reason to feel confused about myself. Not my sexual identity, but just everything about my whole identity. I could finally put it to rest: I'm bisexual, and that's where all the self-loathing came from. I was ignoring a part of myself that was screaming to be heard. Maybe that's why it took so long for me to feel comfortable dating. Maybe all my anxiety would suddenly go away.

Awhile ago, my life was finally starting to look up after a very long period of being down. I had a decent job, nothing spectacular but it paid relatively well and was enough for me to make my rent and start working my way out of debt. Had plans to get into school again. I was seeing a nice girl and things were generally going okay.

Then a higher up in the company came down with a hatchet and I was one of the people to go. Months earlier I had been in a Facebook thread that ended up being critical of the company and that outweighed years of working there, and working well by all accounts. I worked well, got along with everybody but somebody with a bigger office decided I needed to go.

To make matters worse the company happily threw me under the bus by saying I was dismissed with cause for ""violating contract terms"" so I was denied unemployment insurance despite working solidly at only two jobs for a decade. Because the first company no longer exists and I don't dare put that last place on there my resume now has virtually no references on it.

Since then I've been forced to live off of savings, generosity and by sinking myself back into that debt I was getting out of. The girl I was seeing at the time lost interest and eventually contact with her stopped. Because of my now-lousy resume I've only even got one interview with any company offering a well-paying position with most of them not even calling back, and they decided not to give me that job.

So now I have no choice. I've put in applications and it looks like I'll be rejoining the hairnet and apron brigade, flipping burgers at minimum wage (which, at least, is fairly high where I live.)

I tell myself that I shouldn't be ashamed, that any job is better than not having a job at all and my plans to get back to school to get an actual career going haven't fallen through but it just feels like I'm taking a massive step back in life. I know that I'm just doing what I have to do, that a paycheck's a paycheck and I'm not going to stop looking for better jobs in the meantime but I still feel massively depressed over it.

1369521104.0,14,self.MMFB,1f1vjc,Brimming with impotent rage the last few days since more or less deducing that my mom probably had Munchausen's by Proxy.,16,2,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/1f1vjc/brimming_with_impotent_rage_the_last_few_days/,"After a lot of dredging up old memories, and a lot of research into specific details, etc...

I'm actually pretty confident that my mom (who is now a bipolar wreck who I haven't spoken to in almost 4 years and who is not allowed to see my children) was deliberately overdosing me on two of my medications when I was a kid, in order to make me sick and garner attention from my father and my doctors. She LOVED talking to my doctors, to the point that when I got a bit older a few of them would tell her to shut up so that they could interview me rather than her.
I had a whole litany of problems all through grade school that are easily attributed to overdoses of two meds I was on at the time. 

Pharmacy back then was way more relaxed about pill counts, copays were cheap, they didn't really care how often you filled something especially if it wasn't a narcotic.

Kind of a mindfuck. I mean, I know she's fucking nuts, but this was sort of revelatory.

I still have memory and concentration problems from all the seizures I had from age 9 until around age 14. I was planning to go to med school and then my academics just took a dive around the same time as the seizures started.

Now I work a very mediocre IT job (decent pay, but nothing exciting or very fulfilling) and struggle to write.

I guess there's no punchline. Meh.

I may regret not using a throwaway for these posts, but honestly I see no reason I should, as I haven't done anything wrong and the idea that I should be even a little ashamed pisses me off. 

I spoke to my dad and brother about it, and they were pretty hostile. They've both put our dysfunctional family past mostly behind them and they don't want me digging in this grave.

I spent my entire childhood feeling fragile and getting bullied to the point of physical injury nearly every day that I was actually at school. I felt inferior and vulnerable for my entire life until my mid twenties, and until my late teens a great majority of my ""peers"" gladly reinforced that mindset (along with most of my family, who were always, on the paternal side, hyper-critical of both my father and me and my brother (but never my cousin)). It took me until 24 or 25 to realize that I could actually do productive, constructive things without fucking them up. Something as basic as writing a story that someone else would enjoy reading. 

And then to have this realization about a decade into my ""self-repair"", it's not exactly devastating, but it's sure messing with me right now.

What's particularly galling about this is that if my mom really did this deliberately, I already had Crohn's Disease. I was already sick. I was sick at 3, diagnosed at 6, and had plenty of trouble already. I had to deal with the debilitating effects of the disease and then on top of all of it had to deal with what, I suspect, she was doing to me on purpose when the doctor's visits weren't frequent enough for her. 

I was on an asthma medication with very dramatic effects at toxic levels that would have played into such a disorder nicely, and ditto my Crohn's meds, which at the time were not very advanced and full of, basically, poisons. It's possible the overdoses were accidental but it seems very unlikely given the frequency. What I can't understand is how my pediatrician was so incompetent (but then, I used him for my own daughters for a few years and it's not so fantastic.)

For various reasons, I feel like my family, especially my mom, but also my hyper-critical father, grandparents, aunts, and uncles, systematically ruined my life and made me into a miserable and terrible person that I'm ashamed I ever was. 

This realization is just the latest (and probably greatest) insult. 

Nearly every morning when I was in grade school, I'd get up and the first thing I would do was peel my fingers apart, because they were raw with severe excema (from my meds) and would have healed together in the night. Then I'd wash the cat hair and bed lint from the weeping sores, which felt like setting my hands on fire. Then I'd go to school where I'd wrap my bloody hands in toilet paper and attend class. You might imagine that this was a source of bullying, and general alienation from my teachers, who in the mid 80s felt like it was not only none of their business, but no doubt extremely awkward. 

My prospects at any kind of social life were ruined by these sort of ""disfiguring"", conspicuous, and alienating medical complications, nevermind my mom's interference in every friendship, school activity, etc, to the point that no school mate nor their parents wanted anything to do with me lest they have to also deal with her. (Not to mention how she groomed me to be absolutely paranoid and trust no one and assume that everyone had sinister, ulterior motives.) 

I really thought I could just die at any moment. If I got the slightest bit out of breath or dizzy, I thought for sure I was going to wake up intubated in an ambulance, at best. I still remember waking up *shackled* to a hospital bed when I was 10, with hard leather restraints now reserved for psychotic drug addicts, that the nurses refused to remove for hours for fear I'd injure myself in another fit. 

What REALLY pisses me off is that I've spent the last 10 years (I'm 35 now) first recognizing all of the personality flaws and insecurities and bad traits I was harboring, and confronting myself with them and addressing them and admitting I had a lot to fix. I've become MUCH less cynical, MUCH less paranoid, MUCH more empathetic (instead of just selectively empathetic), and a much better person, in my own estimation, all around. And now I feel like I've been clothes-lined. The last few days I'm irritable, snapping at my kids, pissed off, super disappointed in my brother and father, not even knowing WHAT to think of my fucked up mother...

My cognitive abilities were permanently damaged by those seizures. Sure, my IQ still tests rather high. I'm still a smart guy. But, as I try to write on various projects, I not only have to keep copious notes, but a gantt chart of my plotting, post-it notes all over the place, all sorts of memory aids because as soon as I stand up for a bit and go outside, or have some lunch, or grab a drink, when I sit down again I'm a blank slate. My ideas are gone. My connections are gone. My plot twists are gone. I can't hold it all in my head for more than a few minutes. I feel like I had all of this potential before what I really, really do believe was intentional malfeasance by my mother, and in poisoning me she sliced a huge chunk off the top, which I can never quantify or get back.

And for a while I was doing well, wasn't thinking about him much, and even started talking to three nice guys on OkCupid, although I've only met one and we haven't seen much of each since. Anyway, admittedly this depression spell comes in the wake of learning that he ""restricted"" me on facebook, after I ""restricted"" him.

**Quick background info about everything:** We met in university last year. He would show interest in me in class (staring, complimenting my work, etc.) I'm really shy so I actually avoided him for a while out of nervousness but toward the end of the year I warmed up to him and was able to have short convos with him without stuttering. (I have social anxiety, and I'm not good with guys). Anyway, the class ended last April and I ran into him once that summer while working. Last October he randomly messaged me on facebook saying he missed me, we should hang out, text, etc. Overall he acted like he liked me. 

After we exchanged numbers he'd text me  nearly everyday, and I'd respond. He even tried to ask me out to dinner once. I own a small business so it was difficult to find time to visit him since he lives a few cities away from where I currently reside. *BUT* I made sure to mention 3 times that we could meet each other half way. He was never interested in having to travel any distance to see me though and would never answer that suggestion. Randomly he started ignoring my texts for days when he was the one who texted me first nearly all the time. 2-4 days later he'd text me back apologizing like mad, saying how terrible he was, and that he was busy with school/had fallen asleep/was depressed). ...

I found out through his twitter that he was actually talking to other girls many of those times.I have severe social anxiety, and I suppose, a fragile heart. I've never been in a relationship. The thought of a guy actually liking me and wanting to date me seemed surreal. I was naive enough to think I was wanted, that I deserved love. Instead I was made a fool of and badly hurt because of my ignorance. I hated myself, I cried often and blamed myself for the way he treated me. (I still do look back and nitpick at my behaviour, what I said. trying to figure out how I may have messed this up). I was a fucking mess. I didn't know how to move on from that. I still don't I guess. But I still tried. Literally the only thing I could think to do was erase his phone number (ignore any further texts) and restrict him on facebook. Just try to avoid him forever if possible. 

Recently those feelings of intense hurt, guilt, depression/anxiety have been coming back very strongly. It's because there's a high chance that I'll run into him next month. He’s gonna be attending a convention I’m going to next month as a vendor. I heard he plans to spend most of his time in the vendors area (where I’ll be stationed) and I can’t help wondering what will happen if/when I run into him. (He's approached me at conventions in the past, and I just don't know how to deal with seeing him again.) I mean, I’ll ignore him if I see him. But what if he approaches me? What will I say? How will I get out of it? Thinking about it makes me so nervous I get sick to my stomach. Plus it also rekindles all my hurt feelings and insecurities about why being he played me in the first place. : / 

**EDIT:** He texted me today saying: ""hey ____ :) long time no talk. I take it you’re going to the convention on the weekend?"" I haven’t responded to him yet. I don’t want to, but I fear not replying will make him think I’m angry/hurt. (I am but I don't want him to know). I just don’t want to deal with him anymore. I’m afraid if I reply he’ll say ‘oh, let’s chill.’

To be honest I think the only reason he’s contacting me is because I’ll more than likely be the only person he knows who's going to the con. He asked around if anyone wanted to go with him weeks ago, and didn't get many responses. Look at that, I’m a last resort yet again.

For those of you who don't know, Agoraphobia is the intense fear of a panic attack, or a fear of uncontrollable situations to the point of actually planning your day around avoiding these situations (public transit, restaurants, etc). As a result I barely leave the house for any reason, tonight was one of those exceptions though. It was my Dad's birthday yesterday and we planned this family dinner at a nice restaurant out of town. I decided to grin and bear it for my dad, spent the better part of 2 hours making sure I looked as presentable as possible. When it came time to leave though I could feel my world closing in around me, the entire drive there I was just looking out the window trying to calm myself down.   
  
*""It's not going to kill you""*    
*""It will be over before you know it.""*   
  
After that we actually arrive there and I'm sitting in a big restaurant around a bunch of stranger. Panic meter is up to about a 8 now, and I'm about to eat in front of these people. I'm sitting next to my grandma, who I don't speak to regularly, and is also very quiet.   
My sister and my dad are talking (They are very talkative and social) and taking ""selfies."" Then all of the sudden he goes from taking pictures with her to pictures of **EVERYONE.** At one point he gets to me and I just quietly say;   
  
""Nonononono. No pictures please.""   
""Come on, Just one picture.""  
""No dad, I don't want my picture taken.""  
""Please?""  
""I don't want my picture taken..""  
  
Finally he gives up but it's too late for me,  
I was just so afraid.   
The entire table was looking at me because they thought I was gonna get my picture taken and I just.. I broke down for what seems like no apparent reason.   
I'm talking full on crying, can't breathe, can't move. I wished someone would just kill me right there. I couldn't stop it. Nobody knew what to do either, everyone ignored it and pretended nothing was happening. But that was all I could think of, I was embarrassing them and I couldn't stop it. I just wanted to go back home and never come out of my room again. I couldn't even look at anyone. The food took forever to arrive too.   
  
After all of that, I came home, went straight into my room, and cried.  
My mom called and asked if everything was okay, I said I didn't want to talk about it.  
As much as I **really** want to tell her what I'm feeling, it's physically impossible for me to actually sit down and talk to anybody about what or why I'm feeling a certain way.  
  
I just feel so trapped now, MMFB. I don't know how to fix this. I don't know how I'm going to live with this. I need a hug.  
  
**TLDR; I'm a depressed and have agoraphobia, today I forced myself out to a restaurant for my dad and had the biggest panic attack of my life when he tried to take my picture. The entire restaurant saw it and I was so embarrassed. I can't talk to anyone to anyone physically about it without breaking down.

Uhhh...All of my life I have felt as if my purpose in life was to be a mother. 

Okay.

That would be great if I wasn't in highschool and a few months under my state's age of consent and my boyfriend wasn't 18.

Sadly, we are also financially unable to support ourselves with a child even if it was legal.

It doesn't help that I have a different way of thinking and logic than the rest of America, too.

My logic here, is that since he is older than I am, and technically and adult, he should be able to marry me so we could have children.  

I understand that this view probably makes no sense to those reading this, but it has made sense to me for at least half of my life.

I must also make clear that no he has not brainwashed me into thinking this.  In fact, he is a bit worried about my logic here.

I need to get this off my chest, but I feel so alone in my thoughts...I feel like I should be a submissive wife to him and raise a large family because I am a woman...and thinking like this is unacceptable, so I have never said this before.

It's hard for me to talk to people and make decisions on where I should go in life, for fear that they find out of how I really think and feel. It's scary sometimes because I don't want them to think that there's something wrong with me and that I need professional help, because I feel like it's only me that feels this way and it's embarassing.

A plumber came to my house yesterday morning to dig up and repair a sewer line in my front yard; estimated cost: $400.  I got a call midmorning at work that they found a septic tank buried there that I didn't know existed.  City ordinance stated that the septic tank must be opened up, drained, and filled with sand.  New estimate: $2,700.  They finished the work this morning, and my yard is demolished.  Where they dug is all dirt now, as well as where they drove the excavator is all ruined.  I also lost two bushes and the landscaping around them.

I also went to the doctor yesterday to address a headache that I've been suffering from for a month.  This was my third visit to them about this problem, which up until now they've thought was a sinus infection, but two rounds of antibiotics haven't helped.  Now I have to go and get a CT scan of my head to see if that will help with a diagnosis.

My wife is sick.  She's got a cold, so I'm not able to be close to her.

I miss having a crush. Kind of. The parts where it was clearly unrequited sucked, but I miss that feeling of being really, really into someone. This was how it usually played out:

* Step 1. Meet guy
* Step 2. Fall head over heels.
* Step 3. Realize he would never feel the same way.
* Step 4. Pine after him for the rest of the year.
* Step 5. Somehow get over it.
* Step 6. Rinse and repeat.

The last time I felt that way, for the first time in my life I thought it was reciprocated. But to my horror, he turned out to be the kind of guy who abused prescription drugs, had MFM threesomes, and lied about my giving him a blowjob at his birthday party (the truth was that I had been softly crying on his shoulder because he had just told me 2 hours earlier that he didn't want a relationship). 

Oh, and I was a virgin at the time. At that point he never even got so much as a handjob.

Fast forward a few months. I'm pulling 60-80 hours a week at my job and I'm carving out time to meet guys on OKCupid. Every single one of them did the disappearing act once they found out that I had never had a relationship before. Because clearly, being an attractive, intelligent 20-something virgin automatically means you're a freak. By date 5, they were gone. It was like clockwork.

The one guy who didn't run away became my first boyfriend. There was no chemistry on either end, but he was ready for a relationship and didn't find me objectionable, and I was *more* than ready. Being a virgin, I wasn't in a place of leverage, anyway. We fell into a relationship. He thought we would last for 6 months. We dated for a little over a year until the sex slowed down to a trickle. I told him I didn't want to be in a sexless relationship (God knows, I'd waited long enough).

We broke up a month ago. We were okay with each other, but we weren't right for each other. He told me that he had to hold himself back from saying ""I love you"".

Now, I'm back at square one. Only this time, I don't feel like I have as many options for meeting available, compatible guys. I can't go back to online dating and put myself through that emotional trauma again. Worse, I just feel like I'm never going to be loved. I feel like I'm never going to have that wonderful experience of falling in love with a guy who actually respects me, *desires* me, wants me for *me*. A guy who is as right for me as I am right for him. A guy who has a crush on me.

I have a really close friend, who I'll call Bob.  Bob and I have been really close since the 5th grade.  We are both in college now.  Throughout our years of friendship, we've had many ups and downs, but one thing has always remained constant.  He has always been incredibly smooth with the ladies.  He could literally get any girl he wants.  He's good looking, tall, athletic, funny, and an all around great dude. 

I have another really close friend, who I'll call Anne.  I met Anne back in seventh grade, and she has been my closest female friend since.  Her and I have also had several ups and downs.  I liked her for years and never said anything.  We tried dating in tenth grade, but that didn't work out.  She actually pity-dated me, so it's ironic of me to even call her my ex.  She felt so bad for me that she dated me for a little over a month, then dumped me with a text that said something like ""heyy I don't want to go out anymore.  we aren't good together.  sorry.""  After that was sent she stopped talking to me for a while.  We started talking again, but something about her changed.  She got really flirty, kind of slutty, and she was just frustrating to be around.  Back in the beginning of senior year at high school, her and Bob hooked up once.  At the time, I was a little annoyed, but I got over it pretty quickly. 

I am currently finishing up my first year at college, and Anne and I have been talking a lot.  She confided to me that she ""doesn't know"" how she feels.  She said she wants to talk about our feelings when we both get back.  I received a call yesterday from a mutual friend, telling me that, although Bob and Anne go to two different schools, they've been sleeping together behind my back for a year.  This mutual friend just found that out yesterday.

I don't really think I'm mad.  I just don't exactly know how I feel.  Does that make sense?  Honestly, after everything her and I have been through, it's evident that she just isn't a good person.  I'm trying to decide whether I should just forget about her completely and move on with my life without her.  We have a lot of mutual friends, which is why I'm hesitant.  When it comes to Bob, him and I have been losing touch anyway.  I'm not really mad at him, I just can't seem him and I ever being as close as we were.

So what do you guys think?  Am I being a little bitch about this entire thing?  Please be honest.

Sorry if I didn't reference that right, I'm still learning. 

I created a throwaway just to post this, because it is a sensitive subject and I am completely lost on what to do. Sorry if this is a wall of text but detail is important here: 

This last Friday, CPS showed up at our door. My Dad talked to him for a bit (my fiance and I live with him) and start asking questions. Eventually, it comes into light that my little sister (12) had told her friends at school a story about my fiance touching her when she was 8. These guys questioned her in her room with the door shut, then me. It took a few hours but they stopped my fiance when he came home from work and hauled him off after questioning him. 

I asked my sister what had happened, confused because the CPS fellows said she had changed her story. She told me that a few years back he had went to clean some viruses from her laptop and they had begun to talk while he waited for the scan to finish. She eventually mentioned that her privates were hurting her (itching/ burning, standard yeast infection or heat rash symptoms). He mentions that there is a creme in the bathroom that can help and if not, a little saliva might help the itching if she wants to try that. After a bit she asks him if he'll please look for her and he immediately says no, not a good idea. After a bit of her whining he hesitantly agrees, looks, and puts a little saliva where its red. According to her, he was immensely apologetic and afraid of hurting her, but she insists (and I've asked her multiple times to make sure her stories match) that he did not hurt, intimidate or scare her and it had only happened one time. He confessed to this same story, hysterical over thinking he had hurt her. My sister has seemed calm this whole time, only upset at learning that he might not be allowed to come back. 

Let me clarify...there is no way, shape or form I would even be torn if it had turned out he had hurt her at all. To me, and according to her, this was all an incredibly stupid decision. The school counselor apparently overheard her telling her friend at school and this is where it all started. I am not one of those women who would cling to an abuser for any reason and my Dad and I both agree, one of us would have put him in the hospital if it had turned out to be malicious. 

I don't know how to feel...I can see how it can happen innocently enough. I volunteer with abused and neglected children and I see all sorts of sexual inferences from the honest mistake to full on rape and this, without bias, has qualified as a mistake to everyone I've spoken with on the matter. I've talked to my sister about if she would be ok with me trying to help him through all this and the hypothetical getting back together and she thinks it would be great. My Dad agrees and is supporting him.

I just don't know what to do...I've talked to him twice now, from corrections, and he seems so scared and quiet (that's to be expected of course) and he keeps apologizing, worrying about hurting my sister and he once asked if I could forgive him which I gave a tentative yes to...

I'm just...I'm lost right now, guys...I have no idea how to handle this, emotionally or otherwise. My life has always been full of dysfunction and abuse, aimed at me when I was younger, but this just floors me. If he had hurt her, I'd wash my hands of him and say good riddance but...I think, I hope at least, I am being as rational about this as possible. 

We're not wealthy at all, so I don't know about a lawyer or if it even matters now that he's confessed. I just hope he'll get the minimum and things will eventually fall back into semi-normality, though I doubt it will ever be the same....

Please, you guys...I just don't know what to do. We live in Florida, Manatee County, if that helps. I'm too many emotions at once to describe, I don't know if I'm being rational or if I'm just in shock...Any advice is greatly appreciated.

Writing to get it out. I just want to write out the events that happened over the last couple of days.  I appreciate any insight anyone can give.

I worked for a medium size company.  Probably 150 full time employees.  Definitely had a ""mom and pop"" feel to it.  Whatever the owners wanted, the organization's philosophy was to drop what you're doing and finish their task.

I was fired Monday morning after two years at the company.  I received a call on my way in to work from my boss, who asked me to meet him in HR.  I asked if I should bring anything to this meeting, and he just said ""we'll talk about it when you get here.""  I pulled into the parking lot at the same time as a good friend and co-worker, and joked with him that our boss shouldn't make ominous ""meet in HR"" requests first thing on Monday morning.  I jokingly said I hope I'm not fired, to which my co-worker replied that there is no way that would happen.

I go up to HR and enter the room.  My boss and an HR rep are there.  The HR rep says ""We are terminating your employment for failure to meet job expectations.""  At this point I really thought I was being pranked by my boss, so I look at him and say ""really?  What does that even mean.""  And he just kind of looks at the floor and repeats the same line.

I get the security escort out.  First a stop by my office, where I don't really grab anything except a calendar off my desk.  In hindsight I know I have a suit coat and a little space heater in there, as well as maybe a pair of sunglasses.  You know, little things that won't be missed, but in the shock of it all I didn't even know what to do.  My winter coat was in another part of the building, so I'm escorted over there and pass some part timers.  I say hello, trying not to make eye contact.  I pass a full timer who I worked very closely with.  He jokes about the blizzard.  I fake a laugh, and awkwardly shake his hand (totally out of place for 10am on a Monday morning) and say see you later.

On my way out to my car I see one of my closest friends and tell him what happened.  He can't believe it.

I go home, stunned.  I start getting gchats and messages from my co-workers.  ""so sorry to hear""  ""can't believe this happened""  ""do you want to go to lunch?""

I go to lunch, and my whole department of 10 people is there (save for my boss).  They describe how around 10:15 my boss called them all in for a meeting, and said ""unfortunately we let &lt;me&gt; go this morning.  Obviously I can't talk about why.  We need to hire this position immediately, so please let me know if you know anyone.""  From what my co-workers told me, he seemed sick about having to make the announcement.

So we have a lunch where everyone is angry and ""how can a company do this"" and ""the owners don't know what its like to ruin someone's life like this"" (not my words, my life isn't ruined...but I appreciate the sentiment).  I'm more hurt than mad.

I start to process why.  We had been talking since late December (our work is very seasonal, and the slow season started in mid January) about going in a new direction in the department.  I had created all sorts of new ideas for this new direction, worked with my boss and the department about implementing them, even led a meeting with some company big-wigs about the ideas on the Tuesday before.  In my time here, if I had any criticism about my performance, I immediately rectified it, and had heard only positive things since October-ish.  Not that I heard anything major negative about my performance before October, it is just the last incident I can recall where anyone had an issue.

I had a company cell phone and no personal one (this is a mistake I realize now), so I google phoned HR to ask for my outlook contacts.  The HR rep said she didn't think I could have it, but would check with IT.  I asked for my bosses phone number, because I do want to know why, and she says she can't give it to me.  That's fair...that's what HR does.  I'm a little put off because I can't phone or email my part timers and let them know I appreciate them, or even use other contacts to see about getting another job in the field in the area...so I am a little angry about that.

I do email my boss and say:
Hi &lt;boss&gt;,

I completely understand if you don't want to, but do have two or three
minutes to chat?  I don't currently have a phone but I can call using
google if you give me your phone number.  No worries either way.

If I don't hear from you, thanks for giving me the opportunity over
the past couple of seasons.  I really appreciate everything I've
learned from you, and I'm not just saying that.

All the best.

After a couple hours I get this response:
Thank you for your note.
Any correspondance should be addressed with &lt;rep&gt; in Human Resources.

Let me re-iterate, that I do wish you only the very best going forward.

Which really hurt my feelings at first.  Now that I've had a couple days to process he's probably just covering his ass on the company email address.  But I have to admit it did sting.

I wanted to ask him (and I did ask a couple other people I work with) if I'm not cut out for this business.  I've been doing it for ten and a half years, although only two here.  I really, truly believe I put out good material. But then again, I was fired.  Everyone else I work with thinks I should remain in this field, so I'm still pursing.

I sent a quick message, probably not most professional, but I wanted them to know, to my closest co-workers.  Saying that a job is a job and I'm sure I'll find another one, but I'll never get the opportunity to work with such a great bunch of people.  Gave my new phone number, personal email, and to keep in touch.  Since I sent that I've received a couple heartfelt messages that really made me cry.

So far I've filled out unemployment and made an appointment to meet with the unemployment people tomorrow.  Redid my resume, applied for jobs in New York, St. Pete FL, and Stamford CT.  Three cover letters in one day while still depressed is a lot.  :)

I've moved around a lot in order to move up in the industry.  I really thought I was good to go here, have been saving up for a house as I planned on working for this company for many years to come.  The thought of moving again makes me sick to my stomach.  It was easy when I was in my 20's, but with each move it gets more and more difficult to make new friends, and I would kind of like to stay in the Boston area...but I guess I have to take what I can get.

During the day if I keep busy with cover letters or someone to talk to I've been ok.  But once 9pm rolls around and it's just me and the TV I get pretty down.  Westminster Kinnel Club isn't working for the cheer up tonight.

Ah well.  It feels good to get out there.  And I appreciate you taking the time to read this and offering any words of encouragement.  I know finding out the reason why will likely never happen, so I'm trying not to focus my energies on that.  Easier said than done.

Thanks everyone

I'm 23,came home from college for a few days and whenever I come home we fight.. she is an enormous instigator, always feeding the fire, she likes to turn each fight around onto me. She has problems with the way I speak to her even though I am a calm and nonconfrontational person. When we fight I really strive to be calm, rational and perceptive, but she is having none of it. She accuses me of hating her, treating her like shit, and other horrible things. This devastates me every time I hear it, as this is simply not the case.. and after hearing it so much I tend to get frustrated, but I never say anything hurtful or aggressive.

Tonight the argument escalated to the point of screaming, crying, just really bad. Then she said, ""i want to kill myself. I want to die."" This shocked and scared me immensely, and though I told her that, and.tried to talk to her, she was hysterical. I was reaching a breaking point myself, so I stepped out of the house to calm down. Came back in because I was afraid she would hurt herself. She again raves about how I don't give a shit about her....now this really broke my brain, because minutes ago I was clearly scared and upset at her self-threatening words. These accusations are so damaging to me.

Something in me snapped and I left the house and called the police explaining what happened and that I was extremely worried. She's calling me nonstop so I pick up and tell her I'm sorry, she scared me, this isn't normal, I can't do this, I called the police. She was furious. They came over and spoke with us. They took her to a hospital to speak to someone, which they're obligated to do in a situation where self-threats are made. She complied but was beyond angry that I called them to intervene.

I think I did the right thing but she is seething at this point. I'm scared of what's going to happen. I'm very shaken and upset. I called the hospital after a while to see what was going on and spoke with her. She thinks what I did was an act of betrayal- ""you knew I wasn't serious when I said that! How could you do this to me? I'm so humiliated.."" she is mad beyond words and tells me I did a horrible, terrible thing.

I'm really nervous about seeing her when she is out. she is staying the night because there was no psychiatrist working at the hospital when they brought her, which sucks.. I told her to keep me informed and that I would pick her up at a moments notice, she goes ""no I'll walk home""... I'm scared I won't be able to deal with her.

I must reiterate I love my mom and when we get along we are very close, but we can go from normal to blood-and-guts fighting in next to no time, its incredible.. any words would be appreciated, thank you for reading. Apologies, this post was made on a phone.

Tl;dr verbal fight with my mom escalated, she threatens suicide, I get really scared and called the police, they took her to a hospital, she is incredibly mad at me for taking action.

Edit: Though I asked my mom and the folks at the hospital to let me know when she was discharged, nobody let me know and she walked home this morning. She's not speaking to me but I can sense the impending shitstorm.

Her blood sugar level was at 745, and she was put into the ICU.  They thought she had the flu as well.  Turns out she had really bad sepsis poisioning, and the infection had spread a lot further than they thought.  No big deal, she went into surgery and came out just fine.  Everything went great.  She was going to be leaving the hospital in a few days.  Aunts said she had a great night.  The doctor came and checked on her foot/leg last night, and was slightly concerned about the color, and said they may need to go back in.

Then, when he came in this morning, her O2 levels had dropped really low.  The doctor said that she's just shutting down, and that she probably won't make it past the next 24 to 48 hours.  My mother is hopping on a plane tomorrow, and the only thing we can do at this point is to hope that Grandma holds on long enough for my mother to get there to say goodbye.

I'm trying to tell myself that this is what Grandma wants.  Ever since her husband died back in 2006, she's been waiting to follow him.  But it's still hard to let go and say goodbye.  It's a lot to take in right now.  This morning when I woke up, she was well on her way to being okay, then a few hours later I'm told that she's probably not leaving the hospital alive.

EDIT: Just got a call from my Mom.  She changed her flight and is leaving in two hours.  They'll keep Grandma alive until Mom gets there, and then they'll take Grandma off the oxygen and let her go.

EDIT 2: Mom got there in time, which they weren't sure would happen.  They've pulled Grandma off the oxygen as of 2 AM EST, but she's still hanging on right now.  It's a waiting game at this point.

EDIT 3:  Thank you all so much for the kind words.  It's been a very hectic week, so I haven't gotten the chance to update until now, but Grandma slipped peacefully away a little before 3:00 EST last Monday, Jan 28.

My cat has mammary tumors. This requires surgery. That in itself is a money suck-- I have savings, but it still sucks. This is MY cat, my first actual cat, my princess who favors me. I know that sounds stupid, but I don't really have a loving human family, here. My cat may be bitchy asshole at times, but at least she's not intentionally cruel. Please don't make fun of me. I was already told by my award winning family that a cat's not worth the money I spent to get her checked out (300, for all the tests) already, and that she's just broken so I should put her down and get another one.

2. I work in a call center. Yeah. There's not much more to be said here. Looking for other jobs, applying, but nothing heard back yet. I'm trying to fix my situation, but just up and quitting is not an option. I have to have SOMETHING to go to first. I'm the primary earner. 

3. On that note, I never expected to be the primary frigging earner in a family in my 20's. Of course, I never expected to have someone to put up with me as long as my partner has either. She's not unemployed or anything, and is working for better work, and was in school up until this point. Understandable. But still a piece of stressor and suck. 

4. Diagnosed with depression and anxiety. In treatment. Not getting a whole lot better. Most days I don't feel like getting out of bed. Or I want to kill myself. No, I won't, no I don't have a plan, no blah blah blah. Anxiety is what kills me-- I can only do so much with cognitive tricks, and I have to remember to do them. I realize it's the more lasting/whatever alternative to medication, but I'm getting sick of every fucking day being an ongoing battle. I'm tired. I've been this way for ten years. I just want some type of relief. I also have a slew of other health problems that affect my gastrointestinal tract and sinuses, so I'm rarely well. 

In short, I hate everything. And I'm sorry about the wall of text. I don't have anyone else to talk to and I have work later. I don't know what to do.

EDIT: I felt the need to clarify, when I say family, it's me, my partner, and 2 cats. No kids, no plans to have any. Sorry about the vague wording. I'm not thinking the greatest at present.

It's not easy to give up a part of the family. I saved my dog from a bad situation. She is supposed to weigh 80 pounds but when I got her she only weighed 64lbs. She has numbers on here stomach and her spine is messed up. I think she was kept in a cage her whole life and used for breeding because she's a rare all white German Sheppard.

I have ADD and an anxiety disorder (as well as ""depressive tendencies"", according to my school counselor) and everything's just getting too much to handle.

My brother is autistic and my family has always relied on me to be self-sufficient because of that. I got straight As without being pushed, found (and still hold) a relatively well-paying job, run a few school clubs, served as an executive scout every year since I was 10, even won a few awards for my creative writing. I was really proud of myself for being able to achieve things I wanted in spite of my anxiety.

This year for whatever reason everything's gone to shit. Last year my average was 93 (not great but still) and this year I'm barely scraping an 80. Biology, something I used to excel at, is currently at 80%. Functions, which I got an 85% in last year, is so bad that my teacher wouldn't show me my last test mark for fear of upsetting me. I applied to university a few weeks ago and I don't even know if I'll be accepted, and I can sure as hell forget about any scholarships. All of those years of hard work mean nothing- this year's marks are all that matters and that's really frustrating.  

Meanwhile, my brother's having a really rough time in school (socially and academically) and everybody expects me to be able to help him because I'm his big sister. I'm trying, but there's only so much I can do for him. My mom's emotionally abusive (sometimes physically) and I need to get out of the house, but if I can't afford to go to residence then I don't know what will happen (hence the need for scholarships). My dad works most of the time and can't stand up for himself, much less make decisions for himself. They fight constantly and I've been waiting for them to get a divorce since I was 10- I really only just realized that most people's parents don't act this way. And as horrible as this may sound, I don't really have a relationship with my dad, despite living with him all my life. 

I called Kids Help Phone a few days ago to speak with a counselor, since my school counselor is useless, and the woman told me that if I made a suicide attempt then people would ""pay attention to [me] and would feel bad for [me]"". She asked me if I had ""pills lying around that [I] could take"" and a timeframe, and when I answered yes to both, she just laughed and said she didn't expect me to say yes. I would never attempt for attention though. I think about suicide a lot but I don't think I'm suicidal yet. Fuck, I don't even know if I'm technically depressed. I know that my situation isn't that bad and that there are lots of people that have it worse than I do, which only makes me feel worse because I can't get my shit together. Somebody told me to get over myself because I'm just looking for attention, and maybe I am, but that doesn't invalidate my feelings. I hate myself and the situation I've put myself in. I just feel really sad and hopeless and helpless all the time and I just don't see an end.

When I was fifteen I was convicted as a sex offender. It wasn't until I was almost eighteen when I was told that I was also molested as a child. I am twenty seven now and do not understand what a ""normal"" sex life is. I was relatively lucky. Near-automatic fear response to avoid punishment rather than out of conviction of 'wrongdoing'. Put up walls that haven't come down since. Didn't learn the psychological and physiological damage I had/could have incurred (which equated as 'wrong' for me) until I was nineteen and still learning. Every. Single. God. Damned. Day. My treatment was two years probation, two hundred hours community service, talk to a therapist once a week forty-five minutes away, and registration as a sex offender until I was twenty. 

My father wasn't around much. Parents divorced when I was thirteen. In the cold. That's the one thing I'll remember for the rest of my life from that year. It was so cold outside. It's been almost fifteen years and my mood always goes sour in the cold, from at least the end of September until March. Someone told me about Seasonal Affective Disorder and I don't know. I know I have chemical depression (one of the only things my father left me). I'm not on any medications/treatments, can't afford those. He stayed in town for another year or two before moving a few hours away. Then, after a few more years and a much shorter marriage, he moved out of state. Mom always says I'm a lot like him. Introverted and introspective. Funny and melancholy. The times we've hung out shows she's right.

I haven't been able to hold a job for much more than a year in my life, I can't find a job, failed 2/3rds of my classes this semester that I had to pay for out of pocket (broke as fuck, mooching off parent) and am still single.

To this day I have only ever been in LDRs. Couldn't feel like more of a loser in love if I tried. But the problem in my mind's eye is that I haven't found anyone who truly connects with me and makes me feel all the emotions I connect with love.

Things changed tonight. The girl I normally tutor cancelled on me, leaving my plans wide open, and strangely enough, a friend messages me saying I should come to a poetry reading and read some of my own poetry. Well, I went, and it was quite different than I imagined, but I did enjoy myself.

So now I'm bringing another lab assignment home to work on by myself, which will probably take several hours due to the fact that I'm a slow reader and it will take me a long time to understand the material, without assistance from an instructor or one of my peers.


I'm actually doing pretty well in the class, the real issue that upsets me is that nobody wants to talk to me. I was a wall-flower for the first eight-teen years of my life and ever since I've started college, I've been struggling to change that. 


I got a new haircut, I changed my clothes, I've started wearing contacts, and I started caring about my hygiene again. My parents and their friends say I look much more approachable now, yet I still feel the same.  


I've been going to a social coach and making progress in my therapy. My first semester will end in three weeks and I still haven't made any friends. It could be that being a commuter is holding me back (both socially and academically), but I live ten minutes away from school, my dad's office is literally across the highway, and it would cost an additional $17,000 to become a resident. My parents say that they'd pay for it if it'd make me happy, but I know they don't have the money for it.


My school only has ~4400 students, so I see the same faces everyday, so I have no excuse as to why I'm still alone.

1353278938.0,13,self.MMFB,13f303,My (ex)Fiance and boyfriend of 5 years OD'd on Heroin 2 weeks ago. We were in a fight at the time.,17,4,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/13f303/my_exfiance_and_boyfriend_of_5_years_odd_on/,"I don't know why I am reaching out to Reddit for this right now. I guess it is because he was an avid Reddit(er?) and was so proud when he made the front page one day lol. So here ya go Reddit. MMFB.

I was in a relationship with my boy for 5 years. The beginning of our relationship was not so great. He cheated, I stayed. He wasnt really into for the first year or so, I was. Then one day, he woke up, and started treating me really fucking amazing. I think by that point, I knew I deserved better and when he started treating me how I felt he should have, I took it for granted. I pushed him away until finally he broke up with me. He expected me to fight for it, but I saw it as a way out. 2 weeks later, he wanted me back but I wanted differently. I wanted my chance to be independent and do what I wanted to do. You see, I always put myself on the back-burner and took care of him first. When we broke up, that gave me the opportunity to do me first. I was loving it. 

We still talked almost everyday and were really good friends. I was ok with just being friends but he wasnt. He never gave me the opportunity to miss him because he was always there when I needed help or someone to talk to. Again, I took this for granted. I knew he was depressed about us and that depression ran in his family. I just assumed he was ok. 

When we were dating, he would use percoset recreationally. At first it was occasional, then it became more frequent. I do not like opiates and I did not like who he was when he was on them. Don't get me wrong, I am no muggle. I have struggled with my own addictions, and those happened to be uppers, not downers. We would fight constantly about this. He would argue that if I could do my drugs, he could do his. I would argue that he could never tell when I was on mine unless I told him so, whereas he was a completely different person on his. A person I didn't like. This was definitely a factor in our break-up.

When we broke up, he started using more and more. Of course he was lying to me and telling me that he was clean. But I know when someone is jammed out just by talking to them. I didn't think much of it because I knew it was just the percs, and to my knowledge, you can't really OD on percs. Right? Little to my knowledge, he was up to buying 20 30mgs a week.

After much digging around after he died, I found out that he had begun shooting percs about 2 1/2 months ago. He got really sick one day from shooting those, so he turned to booting dope. Again, He was telling everyone else about it but me. He still had the hope of us getting back together and didnt want to ruin it. Oh how I wish he would have told me. Nobody else did either. 

On November 2nd, he had gone to a friend's house (a mutual friend who i had no idea was using) and went in on a bag with her. He shot up in her bathroom before he left, then went home. A friend (who definitely does NOT use) was gonna come by and hang out with him, maybe grab a beer and catch up. The friend found him in the apartment with a needle turning blue. 911 was obviously called and he was pronounced dead 45 minutes later.

So the guilt trip begins. I cannot stop coming to the conclusion that this is all my fault. I won't hear it from any of you that it was not. I knew when we were together that he was depressed and suicidal. I pushed him away from me so that I could go about doing my own thing KNOWING that he had a history of depression. His addiction was controlled when he was with me, and spiraled out of control because of me. This is nor even bringing up the point that we were not talking when this happened. I was even about to apologize to him because of the fight we had but was always too busy at work or forgot about it before I was able to. The night he died, he had a conversation (with the person who went in with him) about a friend of ours who had lost his boyfriend in March. He said (about our friend) that it was a shame that (our friend) was still stuck in his depression 6 months later and not moving on. He said that a person's death is meaningless if their loved ones forget to live the lives they were supposed to because of the grief that overcomes them. I took this to be a verbal note. Maybe I am wrong, but it seems that in his state of mind, he may not have had a death wish, but didn't care whether he stayed or went.

Though we were not together at the time, I loved him and will continue to love him very much. During the most recent fight we were having, before i decided to apologize, I started to miss him. The one thing I wanted and he wouldn't allow me to do. Now it is too late and I will miss him always. He treated me like a princess and I never saw it until now. I will forever regret taking him for granted and causing the deep depression that (I believe) ended his life. I killed him and I am forever sorry.

This has lead to her being very psychologically abusive. I'm 24 and live with her. Everything that I do is wrong, and whenever I try to live my own life she tries to guilt me out of it.

In 2 weeks I leave for my first ever vacation. A very close friend of mine who lives in another country has bought me tickets as a present. I get to stay with him for 10 days. The time is already booked off work and tickets are purchased and non-refundable. My mom is not happy. I've been told to leave my keys at home, not to contact her while I'm gone so I can ""experience life all alone,"" and that she may or may not let me come back home after.

I haven't even had a sleepover since I was a kid. I've only had one boyfriend and every date I had, or any time I've gone out for pleasure (extremely rare), was made out to be horribly selfish. She always tries to sabotage it all, normally by acting sick and guilting me by telling me she cannot manager alone.

She will do everything she can to stop me from getting stuff done prior, so when I go out or, in this case, leave for my trip, she can point to how I'm neglecting my responsibilities and forcing a sick her to do everything.

A couple weeks ago she injured her knee and was sent for testing and told to bed rest or it's surgery time. Instead of that, she keeps forcing herself to do stuff on it and blaming me as it gets worse. Today it was so bad she fell. I'm terrified she'll injure herself bad enough that she will be confined to bed and I will actually have to stay home, because there is no one else to help her.

When I'm at work, she rarely even eats all day and claims she cannot get food for herself. I'm terrified of what she will pull prior to and during my trip to mess it up. :( I just want something fun. It means the world to me. A week away from the abuse and with someone I care about a lot. It's not fair...I've tried to suggest so many things to make my time away easier on her and she refuses it all. I should be so excited right now, not scared and anticipating it will get messed up and I will lose my opportunity (and friendship, as I don't think I could face him if he lost that kind of money on tickets...).

Now for my story...

At the beginning of my depression, my family told me that I had aspergers syndrome, a form of autism. I only knew then what it was at the time but knew so little about it, I ended up thinking about it negatively because I instantly seen it as a learning disability, so I couldn't achieve the potentials I ever wanted. Throughout the whole year, I was faking my emotions around people, all the time, when I was on my own I would he depressed, frustrated to think of all the things I want when I couldn't achieve them. (I want to be a psychologist, musician, philosopher and a car mechanic.) As I previously stated, I saw it as a learning disability, so therefore I thought of myself as uneducatable even though I'm one of the smartest people in my class (I go to a normal school, people didn't even know I had aspergers until I told them so I could figure if it was obvious or not.) I had nothing but the punchbag in my school's P.E hall to take my anger out, which kind of helped hiding what I was angry about. 

Within the second year of depression contained the worst moments of my life, I felt there was no hope for me. I have no speech errors except the odd slip the average normal person makes which would be a mispronounciation of a word, but I took an extra second for EVERY sentence I spoke to make sure my voice was right and the sentence was structured before it was said. It was an unbearable pressure I put myself on. The whole year however, I would cry 6 times a week average, on the toilet or in my room, if someone was in my room I'd pretend to be constipated and be crying for 30 minutes, I'd even be watching my tears hit the ground and wishing it was me falling to an instant death. I also lost plenty of sleep over it too, I was awake for 5 days straight because of the headaches I got from thinking frequently about my aspergers. Of course I didn't want to think about it, but the thought would hit me every day. One day in November, back in 2011, I was standing on my window ledge getting ready to jump. I had planned to right a 50 page suicide note on how much I loved everyone, the pros and Cons of my perspective of my life, how I felt I wasn't worth people's time and all that I 'could of' been. I ended up stepping off the ledge and thinking to myself ""I am not worth life, but I'll try help others to make up for it."" And ""If I really wasn't stupid I would be able to 'kill' away my syndrome and my memories of a kid when I was oblivious to it."" All this was happening to me and nobody knew, I was so good at faking emotions that people thought I was getting happier, wise and not a problem of his own, even though I was so upset I couldn't cry anymore even thought I wanted to so it would release my emotions more, that way I could fake it for longer.

Only this year back in January I was still depressed, but I couldn't contain it, I ended up with tears in my eyes in front of friends and family, thinking is was something small, them one day I was sitting in the back of my car and my mother decided to show her picture of me as a kid, tears rolled down my face and then she asked ""are you ok?"" I replied with an ""I'm fine"" even though I wasn't. That day we were driving around for 8 hours and I cracked, began to cry alot, pulled some of my hair out in stress and then my family brought me home. 

I have discussed the whole thing with my mother and she pointed out that since it's invisible to most people if not everyone, you're really better off than some of the average people. Aspergers has is abilities too, which can help me with things while I don't even have any disability forms showing what-so-ever. I bet some of you redditors didn't know Albert Einstein, Bill Gates or Bob Dylan had aspergers, look how successful they are! When I had found that out I was suprised that they had it, then the greatest thought struck me. ""If people that know about aspergers can't point it out on them, this could mean everyone could seem the same with me, no matter who they are or what they have."" 

Now I'm 5 months out of my depression, I'm a producer who's been on soundcloud for only 3 months and has 1,400 followers. I wrote the best essay my school has seen in years. I've talked 1 person out of suicide and 1 out of depression. I've donated 100's of euros to charities. I got great mock results for my Junior Cert with an average grade of C (Exactly what I need for a psychology course and music course for when I'm going to collage). I have more friends then I've had before. I'm actually happy. I'm proud of myself. 

I hope you now feel better and that I've possibly helped you with your depression, if I didn't, inbox me your actual problem and I'll help out as much as I can. 

Your conclusion is to always tell someone you can trust. You are never alone. Here's a tip from my own insight (May not work for everyone). You'll have shit times in life, but also very great times and family and friends that care about you!

Music can help you a lot. I like plenty of music genres, when I was depressed I began listening to Nine Inch Nails, although their music isn't optimistic at all, I felt the lyrics connected to how I felt which made me smile in honesty for a while which was hard to do at the time. I still listen to their music today and I'm glad it had helped me (i am not/never was a goth or an emo by the way.)

MMFB? ,16,2,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/tpckj/spent_the_last_month_watching_my_future_go_up_in/,"I'm a 21 year old almost graduate from my University. I was premed but struggled academically and am now a liberal arts major and taking pre-med classes. After struggling for four fucking years, working my ass off in classes only to get mediocre grades or fail and go through retaking weed out classes over and over - someone finally figured out the damn problem. I have severe ADHD and an additional learning disability that's made academics progressively harder for me to get through as they require daily diligence. 

I figured this out the Spring semester of my senior year. I can't tell my parents, they don't believe in such things (they attribute failure to my character and lack of willpower, we are a traditional asian family) and it's too late to keep retaking classes. I have my MCAT in a week, and since my diagnosis a month and a half ago, I've been seeing a learning specialist and my studying has improved 100x over. But it feels like too little too late, I won't get into medical school, hell even the Carib schools. 

Because of my delays in core classes, my university granted me a graduation extension but I need a whole year to meet my last 3 classes for my libarts major since they are only offered in (one in Spring/ 2 in Fall) and my parents think I'll still graduate at the end of this summer with my original biochemistry degree. 

I can't tell my parents any of this (between the shame and backlash, and they have struggled to come here to give me a future I can't break their hearts and they would never be able to get past it) and I've always taken my academics and future as my responsibility and its all fucked and its my fault. I always thought I was just too lazy and too stupid and between periods of self loathing for not working harder, I pushed myself and yet had little to show for it. I'm glad I know what the problem is but I'm so angry I didn't know even just a year ago, let alone maybe at the beginning of college. 

I'll never be able to work in medicine, even with this explanation, and medicine is all I've ever wanted to do. My advisor mentioned the university maaaaaay consider retroactively dropping courses they felt were unfairly targeted by my disability but I doubt that's even significant enough to do anything for the years of accumulated damage. I'm hard working, I'm not using this as an excuse or a handout, I like to study and do well. 

I graduated high school at the top of my class because all my AP courses and honors courses required just IQ and coming from a small high school my teachers knew me so well, they were so lenient when I didn't finish something on time or got distracted midway through one assignment because of another assignment. 

In the last month I've exhausted every path I can to try and rectify my record, while working hard at more classes and MCAT prep to show that I have this under control - but each day it seems more and more like I'm trying to turn water into wine and I can't do it anymore. I've never felt worse about myself, and so bleak about life. Sometimes I want to walk in front of a bus, but I couldn't hurt my parents like that. 

**TL;DR - I'm an intelligent, hard-working student with all the potential to become the doctor I've always wanted to be...and I fucked it all up, and it's all my fault and I know that, and no matter how hard I try to fix anything, I'm just one of a million other premeds and no one cares and my dreams are gone and I feel like a failure and burden that should have never existed.**

(trigger warning) :(",17,2,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/tafgm/i_need_some_insight_please_im_having_a_really/,"**hello. this is a very emotionally charged post, and i'm finding it difficult to begin. i recently subscribed to mmfb and have been glad to help others, but i realize that i may need some uplifting, too... anyway, to begin:**



a week before my 8th birthday, i was the victim of kidnapping and sexual molestation. i worked with the police, courts, attorneys, court counselors, saw therapists, etc. as a result of the evidence saved, my very detailed description (of the events, the man, his car, location, etc), and with my testimony in court, a unanimous jury ruled for life imprisonment without possibility of parole.


i am also the child of divorce. my parents split when i was 2, and my mom remarried when i was 6. after i was kidnapped, i wanted to feel safe, and to be able to trust men. my father has never been very affectionate, and i lived the majority of the time with my mom. thus, it was that my stepfather became the ""loving"" father figure in my life.


i cannot pinpoint exactly how long after the kidnapping occurred that this began, but i would estimate it to be a few months after. i was still involved with attorneys, spending days outside of school downtown in the court room. but it began in this way: (most) every night, my stepdad would come into my room to ""cuddle"" with me. he would bring books and read me stories, or tell me stories about his daughter when she was my age, or other things. he began tickling my arm, by rubbing his hands very slowly back and forth. gentle affectionate things like this are okay, right? but one night he kissed me. not just on the forehead, like a father might, but on the mouth.


i still wanted him to cuddle with me. i was still the scared little girl who needed to know men were okay, who needed to know they could be loving and safe, and not scary like the ""bad guy"". so i would ask for him to cuddle. and the kissing kept going, and got worse. he would french kiss me, he would touch my body (never my genitals directly), but still, he would ""caress"" me. i had a pair of pajamas that were silky, a tank with matching shorts. when i would wear these, he made comments on how sexy i looked. frequently. he began making comments while i was around the house, and not just when we were ""cuddling"". telling me how sexy i look, how he liked when i wore that. i didn't really understand.


one night, i remember him french kissing me, and he did something weird to my neck. it sort of hurt, and made my spine tingle, and it was strange. i didn't know whether i liked it or not, it was just what it was. i didn't really understand that either. that was on a friday ngight, because in the morning, my mom, his son, him, and i all went to McD's to eat breakfast. mom was sitting to my left in the booth, and notices something on my neck. my stepfather and stepbro are sitting across from us in this same booth. she lifts my hair a little (i don't think he noticed, but i have no clue) and says ""what is that on your neck?"" i did not know there was a mark on my neck, only that he had done something to it. i told her the cat must have bitten me and covered it quickly. this was the first instance where i began lying. i lied to her about that, but on another level, i would lie to myself. 


the thing with my stepdad went on for several months. on one occasion, he was cuddling with me when he said ""i can't be doing this. i am married to your mom."" i didn't understand what he meant, and didn't really get it. i wanted him to stay because i sought affection, but when he brought my mom up, my viewpoint changed. i thought to myself ""why did he bring mom up? is this something wrong that mom would not like?"" i stopped wanting him to cuddle with me after, although he sometimes would try to come in. i told him, shouting from my bed into the open hallway door ""NO! i don't want you, i want to cuddle with mom instead!"" sometimes, mom would come in, but she never did as often as he had, and eventually i stopped cuddling with anyone altogether.


when i mention that i began lying, i realized that was the dynamic shift that occurred in my subconscious. a few months ago, i realized i had been living my life in denial, and the deepest, most painful memory i had kept repressed. i tried once, at 17, to tell my mom what happened. she chalked it up to my being ""imaginative"" and ""making this up"" after my ordeal. i was too weak to tell her, and put it away again. at 22, after leaving an abusive relationship, i had an epiphany--i had been living my life the wrong way, and not in full honesty. my anxiety was stemming from somewhere, and i realized that i needed to take this to my family, to tell them the truth, and to tell them how i had been living, and apologize. i am a very honest and open person, and wish to confront this painful event and move forward with my life. while my mom divorced this man a few years ago (he had multiple affairs for 12 out of 13 years of marriage, real winner), i still saw him around. my mom has her own issues, and ghosts of the past (i do not know details, but i do know something happened to her), because she decides this man is still valuable to have as a ""friend"". at 22, after my recent epiphany, i decide that i need to confront her about this trauma, and undergo therapy together to get through this.


so, at 22, i sit her down to talk. i tell her what happened, and she dismisses me again. it is so difficult to say things to her, such as the time he took his pants off and i felt an erection on my leg. i told her this, for example, and she says ""well, what was he wearing?!"" (i don't know, boxers? he was not fully naked, i respond) ""well, xxxxx doesn't EVEN WEAR boxers, so that can't be true."" she tells me ""i have thigns to say, but i don't want to tell you. when i pry this information out of her, she says ""i didn't want to tell you this but xxxxx said you began 'acting inappropriately' as a child."" again, she tells me i was imaginative, that there's no way, and that i am ""making this up to keep her from hanging out with her friend."" she continued to spend time with him, inviting him to the house to walk the dogs with her. on each occasion where he would come over (after i told her, and told her how much anxiety i have over this), i would have panic attacks. the third time this happened, he hadn't arrived at the house and she had the dogs ready to go. she came into my room and found me on the ground. she told him to stop coming after that, because daughter is ""going through some things and doesn't want to see you, xxxxx.""


during the first therapy session, with xxxxx's old therapist, mom and i are talking about the events and our feelings. my mom says ""this isn't fair. we need to get xxxxx in here to have his side of the story."" this was UNBELIEVABLE to me as well as incredibly painful to hear.


my mom doesn't care about something that has hurt her daughter more than anything. although i was able to confront my kidnapper, and put him away forever, i was not able to even confront this event as a reality until recently. i tried at 17, talking with my longterm boyfriend, the only person who i could share anything with. he encouraged me to tell her, and i got it thrown in my face. as a capable adult, i'm having it thrown in my face and it is devastating me. i have panic attacks and high anxiety around my mom as a result of this. i cannot comprehend how a person who wanted to kill a man who harmed her daughter can so easily dismiss something as psychologically damaging as this. we have had 3 sessions total. even though it has been months since i told her, she did not set up an appointment for over two months. this is not important to her, this is not something she seems to even want to understand, i don't think she will ever understand my perspective, and my anguish, and it will always damage our relationship. 


**tl;dr**: i was a kidnapping victim around age 8, and testified to put my perpetrator away for life without parole. i saw a therapist. at home, my stepdad would ""cuddle"" with me, french kissing me, calling me sexy, etc. i lived in denial and realized this event was the source of my anxiety, and the reason i was living my life a certain way (epiphany after leaving abusive relationship). mom and i go to therapy, and she doesn't believe me. i don't think she ever will. she continues to hang with him, and i have terrible anxiety and a strained relationship with her because i feel like she cannot, and does not want to, understand something that is terribly hard for me to even say.

Good thing to do, right? But the upset texts and phone calls all week haven't been easy to deal with. I came home from work to find a 3ft long venomous snake in my house (unrelated, but still a little jarring).

My mother was admitted to the hospital on Tuesday. I found out during my lunch break on work, and rushed straight there as soon as I got off. She was diagnosed with cancer last year, it's in remission but she has a checkup in a few weeks and hasn't been feeling well. While there I visit my ailing grandmother with Alzheimer's. She doesn't recognize me, and actually becomes fearful and voices concern that I'm there to beat her up. I leave so as to not upset her.

Wednesday was mostly uneventful. I switched to working 10 hour days at work.

Thursday, after saying nothing since Monday morning my friend begins texting me and piling on guilt. My uncle gets jumped and is taken to the hospital bleeding out of his ears and with a badly swollen face. I saw him yesterday and there's a clear outline of a baseball bat bruised on his arm, too. Grandma gets worse, no one expects her to make it through the night.

Saturday, Grandma passes around 5am. That afternoon most of the family comes to our place for dinner to celebrate her life. It was a good day, everyone was sharing memories and it's been a long time since the family was together like that. Then my cousin, while playing with his kids, trips and faceplants hard onto a gravel driveway. He hurts himself bad (one eyebrow got completely torn off, tore muscles, etc.) and emergency crews are called. Children and adults are crying. It's a tragedy and a clusterfuck.

My parents tried their best and did a good job. But a lot of things are beyond individual control and you have to play with the cards you're dealt.

So this is what my life looks like:

* I am a single dad with an autistic kid. He's not difficult, but uncertainty of what the future holds, is crushing.

* His mom (my first wife) lives in another country and is in the process of reassigning  gender. 

* My second wife left me last year. After moving from our apartment to a home for abused mothers for several months (I didn't abuse anyone, but her son from her previous relationship had a too hard of a time adjusting to his new life, so his psychologist suggested they move to the home). I'm still devastated by that. I've known her for 15 years and idealized her for all this time. I know we can never be together again, but I can't help wishing it (and wishing her son away in the process, which makes me feel guilty).

* My dad, who was my best friend, died three and a half years ago. My mum quite lost it after that. Insomuch, that I had to severely restrict any contact with her, as her behaviour was becoming impossible. That means there's only my son and me. I have no other support whatsoever.

* Actually I do have a friend and she expressed willingness to babysit my son, should I need it. That would all be fine and dandy, had she not gone rampant crazy on me two months ago. She completely lost it and gave me much shit for befriending her boyfriend online. After that I keep my distance.

* I am burdened with a degenerative disc disease and a congenital spinal defect, that causes me terrible pain and prevents me from working for couple of months a year at least.

* I have a bipolar disorder, that's being treated and is going quite well. But still I spend way too much time depressed. With the added stress of everything else in my life, it can be debilitating sometimes.

* I also have a genetic predisposition to diabetes (almost all my immediate ancestors had it) and high cholesterol. It doesn't help that I'm obese (gained 60 lbs in the year I started taking medicine for bipolar). It makes my back, diabetes, liver function and self esteem very troubled. 

* Food however makes me feel good and makes my life bearable at times when everything is just too overwhelming. Now this just plain sucks. The only thing that makes me feel better, is also killing me in the long run. I also feel burdened by the obligation to live as long as possible in order to take care of my son, who'll never be able to life on his own.

* Hay fever for two and a half months every years suck all pleasure from the nicer weather that starts in the spring. It negates the good things I could look forward to. I'm also allergic to a million other things. So as much as I'd love to get a cat, I can't. Asthma flares up when I have a cat at home.

* With my physical and mental problems, I've had a lot of my plans and wishes shot down. I don't dare wish for things or make plans, because so many times they've been shot to pieces by something that was wrong at the time.

* Because I'm absent from work so much, I constantly worry I'll get fired. They've been great so far, but I feel guilty and like a burden on the company. 

* I have a nearly finished university degree and another college degree, but I can't bring myself to start working on them. The stress I have in my life right now is nearly killing me. Any addition and I feel 'd snap (like I have in the past).

* My doctors are no help anymore. My GP sends me to my psychiatrist. My psychiatrist just shakes her head in disbelief over my reactions (says I'm a phenomenon) and that's it. Apart from the regular therapy for the bipolar, she does nothing. Well she did recommend I go to a therapist that's not covered by my insurance. I might as well do that.

* Because I've been feeling very sick and tired for th last two months, my apartment is a huge mess. Bedore I used to clean, cook, take the trash out and keep things moderately decent. Recently it's a trash heap in the middle of my living room, where I'm camping on the couch.

I make sure my son is fed and that he goes to school in clean clothes without tears in them (something my parents didn't really care about), but that's about it. I can't seem to put myself up to doing anything more. This is, of course, bringing me down even further.


Anyway, I don't know what, if anything can be done, to make me feel better. I just needed a place to vent my pent up feelings of frustration. It will probably get better with time. 


tl;dr: I have many things going against me and I feel like crap most of the time because of it.

My fiance (26m) and I (26f) have been together for almost three years now and have been living together for one. Back in early October we found out that I was pregnant and we were thrilled! For the next couple months we got more and more excited as time passed and couldn't wait to find out what we were having and all that. In December we went to my first OB appointment only to find that I had had a missed miscarriage and that the baby had died three weeks prior. I was devastated! I still felt pregnant, I was still having pregnancy symptoms! I went and had a D&amp;C which wound up almost killing me due to a complication where my placenta had grown over an artery.  When they went to remove it it ripped open the artery and I almost bled to death. So, all in all a VERY traumatic experience.

From the moment I woke up after surgery in my hospital room (on the pediatrics floor of all freakin' places to put a woman who just lost her child) and heard (this is not an exaggeration either... it really happened and really freakin' broke my heart) the lullaby on the intercom indicating a new baby had just arrived up until well now I have felt like a failure as a woman. Like my uterus is a hostile baby killer not fit to bear a healthy child. I should also mention that I have PCOS, which puts me at a greater risk to miscarry and/or have a hard time with conception.

Family and friends have tried to comfort me with statistics and facts about how LOTS of women (even my mother) have miscarriages with their first pregnancies and ""Hell, some even miscarry without knowing it just thinking it is a heavy period.""  This doesn't really comfort me. This doesn't make me feel any less like a failure. I don't know how to feel better about this.
Since the miscarriage and subsequent near-death experience I have been unable to comfortably have sex with my fiance.  I didn't feel the desire to have sex following everything that happened up until last month. The first time we tried *he* couldn't perform because he was caught up on thinking about the miscarriage and almost losing me.  A few days later we gave it another go and it worked out, I guess. I mean... ever since the whole thing happened it is physically uncomfortable to have sex. I did some research and think I may have something called Vaginismus.

If you don't know what Vaginismus is, it is a condition where the pelvic floor muscles involuntarily tighten making penetration/intercourse harder to achieve. It is sometimes developed after a traumatic experience involving sex. You can read more about it [here](http://www.vaginismus.com) if you'd like.

I feel terrible because I **want** to have sex more with my fiance, I have (or, well, *had*) a pretty healthy sex drive up until all of this happened. Sex for me now = pain and frustration. I just want to feel like a woman again. I want to enjoy sex again. I want to have a damn baby. I *KNOW* these two things are not the only qualities that make a woman a woman, but I can't help but feel like a failure. I can't help but feel like I am ruined.

So, **TL;DR... I couldn't successfully bear a child, I can't have sex... I feel like a failure as a woman. MMFB.**",,False,,t5_2sjdn,False,,,True,t3_sjqoy,http://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/sjqoy/feeling_like_a_failure_as_a_woman/,

Things have actually gotten worse. Because I am in remission, everyone assumes I must be feeling better, and thus stop being supportive and kind. I have lots of health problems left over from surgery and cancer. The first is that my testosterone is low and thus I am tired all the time, no energy and my moods swing like crazy. I also have a great deal of nerve pain from damaged nerves from surgery, which at this point, my doctors are telling me, may by there for the rest of my life.
So here I am, depressed, tired, in pain, and addicted to pain pills with no one to talk to. My best friend is in Afghanistan, serving the miltary while his wife is at home pregnant, so I don't feel comfortable going to him with my problems. The one person I used to talk to a lot was the most amazing, beautiful, and genuine person I have met in my life time, but with the news of remission, we haven't talked much.
Talking to her is a bit of double edged sword cause it just reminds me how I am in position to pursue a relationship right now, which reminds me that I have gained weight through all this(comfort eating + lack of exercise)
All I want is to feel like myself again, have some sort of motivation to live, get back to the gym, get in shape and be happy again. Though I don't see that happening any time soon with the depression, pain pill addiction, and nerve pain which makes it very hard to walk or stand for a very long period of time.
To make matters worse I applied for financial support to help with my doctor bills and other financial needs since I obviously can't work and I was denied. I resubmitted but I am not very optimistic, I only re did it because my mom wanted me to. Then my step father and father are constantly on me about working and starting college. I can't imagine being in any routine when there are days I can't even get out of bed.
The only time I leave my house is to go to the doctor, I've tried shopping with my mom but I can't really walk through the store and we always end up leaving early, then she has to make another trip to the store and I feel guilty.
Well if anyone takes the time to read the wall of text, or just stop by and say hi, I'd appreciate it.

My fiancée and I have been together for 6 years, but I've known for the last 2 that I want to marry her.  These last 2 years have been a struggle because I didn't have a real job when I got out of college and ended up getting fired.  I knew I couldn't marry her without having a foundation for our future.  I'm back in school now, one semester left and I have an awesome internship that I'm 95% certain is going to hire me full time after I'm done.

In the last few years, I've run in to a few people who think marriage is a bad idea and cite various reasons why.  Normally, I'd shrug them off and think their reasons are invalid and that I've made the decision for myself.  I've looked further in to their arguments and I think they have some valid points, though mostly focused around divorce.  I don't want to be so headstrong and arrogant as to think I won't get divorced, but I have absolute faith and trust in my fiancée and I know the feeling is mutual.

As I said, normally I can just shake this off, and it's not that I'm doubting my relationship, but I just really want to hear some people defend marriage for a change.  I feel like ripping it apart is the easy road and I want to hear what others think.

The past year or so I've been really depressed and haven't been able to make it to most classes. This wasn't much of a problem last semester because I still aced the exams, but this semester has classes with mandatory attendance so I'm failing with no way of recovering. I can get a medical withdrawl for depression but if I do that I won't be able to row at major races like the SIRAs, ACRAs or Dad Vails because I won't pass the credit check. I've been on the team for three years and every spring something has happened that has prevented me from rowing. First year I was accused of something I didn't do and put on suspension until it cleared up (took a whole year because bureaucracy is slow). Last year I got mono and was told 24 hours before my first spring race that I couldn't race because of the illness. That crushed my spirits right there and my grades slipped because of that. I haven't yet won a medal (I've come really close though) and spring races are my best shot at one. I've worked my butt off and brought my time down to roughly 6:50 from a 7:30 in the past five months (2k time). I'm still working my butt off so I can make top boat but I won't be able to if I withdraw, and if I don't withdraw I'll flunk the semester. 

On top of all this, the girl I've liked for the past year stopped talking to me for a couple of months and is now dating one of her friends. I think that she thought we were dating while we were talking but I though we were just friends, and now I feel like I missed a huge opportunity (because it's VERY rare that I actually like a person)

I've been on my own since I was 13 so family isn't an option. I don't have many friends, and the ones I do are either busy or don't care. The fact that the friends who I consider trustworthy enough to talk to don't care isn't a very pleasant feeling either.

Job-wise, I'm a freelancer (I work as a financial advisor, prop trader, and network admin - All so I can pay for college without taking out a loan). One of my former clients has been effectively blackballing me because I refused to restructure their finances to mask their income from 'questionable' activities. I can't do anything about it because of confidentiality stuff, but I can't hold a client for more than a couple of weeks not because they interfere (They're kind of big in what they do so their credibility trumps mine).

I kind of feel like it was a waste of time working hard to get into University and a waste of time aiming for such high marks during Uni. I am dyslexic which has caused me trouble but when I did well, I felt so pleased with myself after having been told by my former depute Headmistress that I'd be ""be lucky to work in a factory"".  
Before my Mum died I had discussed going doing this course with her and I suspect that if my Mum had still been alive, I would have taken the failure a bit better (although, if she'd been alive, I would have been able to go).
My Dad is not much help all he says is ""you'll find something else"" which is what he said when work dried up at the factory I was working at and I found myself without work (still haven't got anything). My brother has no idea what to say and I don't really have any friends.

it's my 21st birthday. i've been living with my 36 year old boyfriend for months now. things have been more or less fine-- we fight occasionally and resolve things, but...for our proximity, we get along well. not the best decision to move in together, i know, but it was a mutually beneficial decision that i do not regret.

i don't see things objectively enough to really know why, but he blew up at me on friday night and has been a HUGE dick ever since. we've both gotten little sleep and have been in foul moods over the past couple of days-- there's been a lot of name calling, and he takes every opportunity he can to storm out/make me miserable.

i've been looking forward to my birthday for months now. and he knows that. i was hoping he might suck it up and at least be civil with me for the big day. when i went out at midnight, he reluctantly came with me, then left in a rage within 10 minutes of being there. when i came home around 3:00, he spent the whole night telling me i'd be better off without him, that he doesn't want to be alive, that he's going to pack up his stuff and move out, etc...

he yelled at me for getting phone calls that woke him up at 1 PM this morning. he said he was going to start packing his things, and that's about when i lost it. i threw all of his clothes out of his drawers, threw a bunch of his shit into a pile, told him ""good, get out,"" and sat on the floor and cried. it was quite a dramatic scene! i do regret acting out, but three days of this is a lot. ...and its my birthday!!

he told me that no one cares its my birthday as he left. i don't know when he'll be back. but i can't leave until he does because he didn't take his keys and he has no cell phone. he's just out there with his bike. and this is why i need your input, reddit.

i am so worried about where he is, when he'll come back, and why he's being this way in the first place. i'm going out with a bunch of my friends tonight and i want to have fun. any insights on how to ease my mind about all of this? i'd like to get my emotions under control before having a few drinks. any suggestions on a course of action as far as whether or not i should come home tonight/how i should approach him when i next see him would be helpful too. i don't care whether we break up or stay together or anything like that-- if he's going to keep behaving like this i'm better off without him, but if he's sorry and there's something going on i'll hear him out.

**tl;dr it's my birthday and my boyfriend has more or less broken up with me. i've spent a lot of the day crying at this point... a little perspective/advice would be very helpful before i go out and try to have some fun with my friends.**

I don't know these people anymore. I recently found out that someone I had considered one of my best friends tried to make a long-term SO cheat on me with her. She then lied about it, turning the blame on SO. It nearly ruined my relationship with him. This was a girl that I would have trusted my fucking life with.

The whole ""make new friends"" advice cannot apply to me. I am not in college. I chose to work for a few years to scrape up some money before going off to school. I am friendly with my coworkers, but on a strictly business level. I rarely have time to connect with new people.

I am currently a sophomore in college and just recently returned from winter break.

I miss my parents, my friends back home and mainly the sense of stability I felt at home. This seems really strange to me though, because I have a small group of friends that I live in an on campus house with and I would think that would help reduce these feelings. 

My homesickness gets so bad sometimes that I contemplate transferring to a school closer to home where my friends go to college. I know I can't do this, however, because I have so many commitments at my current school (ROTC mostly). I also know that if I were to return home, I wouldn't receive as good of an education and I feel like I would be losing so much of my own potential.

And I know I should be grateful that I even *get* male attention, despite it not being the kind that I want but here goes...

Just as the title says, I have the *worst* luck with guys. I think I'm a relatively attractive, interesting, and funny young lady. Not trying to toot my own horn, but from objective introspection, I've come to the conclusion that I'm not *that bad*. And while it's somewhat stupid to base my value on whether or not I can get a guy, it just gets me down sometimes. 

I'm basically never approached when I go out, and I've even tried sites like OkCupid. And while I'm lucky to have *some* type of success with OkC, I'd rather have no luck than something that *looks* like luck but is actually disappointment in disguise. Every single person I've met and dated (on or offline) always turns into a FWB or just stops talking to me altogether. 

I'm not looking for that. I want to care for someone and feel secure in knowing that they care about me too. And not just want sex or anything like that. I always feel like... an object. And while some can argue that I'm letting myself feel like that, I will note that I do defend myself when I notice things going downhill. I'll cut ties or call the guy out on it.

What usually happens though is that I get my hopes up, then realize the ugly truth too late. Then I get hurt.

Right now, on the outside and to others... it looks like I got it made. I just turned 24 and I own my own home, I just started my own business (a gun shop), and I have a nice vehicle and pretty nice things. I'm not made of money, but I can pay my bills and have a little left over for things I want.

When trying to talk to others about what bothers me, they immediately default to ""Yeah but look at your house!"" or ""But look at your business, you'll do great and THEN you'll be happy!"" or ""you are doing so much better than anyone else your age!"" but that doesn't really help. I know what I have and what I don't have. What I have are things and not happiness.

I am a very loving guy. I like the idea of romance and relationships and I haven't really had a tough time finding girls... but finding the right type of girls is difficult. There are tons of girls that get VERY interested in me only after they hear about what I do or see where I live or what I drive. I think it clouds their judgement of me.

I've been girlfriendless for over a year. My last relationship ended like all of my other relationships: she cheated on me. This has happened to me so many times it's unreal. But I started kind of seeing another girl recently. I admit, I've been holding back with her because of my past experiences. I was a little distant for that reason. I guess I wanted to see how badly she wanted me. But I think I put her off a little too much. And on NYE I was super drunk and acted like a total fucking asshole to her. I don't remember it, but it was pretty bad. And I had no reason to do it. 

Anyways, my problem is that I am extremely lonely. I don't hang out with old friends because I decided to get serious with my life and be responsible and they would all rather sit around, do drugs, and not take life serious or have zero ambition. I am glad I left them behind.. but now I don't have anybody to relate with or hang out with. And because of the profession I chose involving firearms.. some people don't like doing what I like to do like going shooting. And I'm not totally in ""adult mode"" yet. I still like to have fun. I feel like I'm too young to settle down and I'm too old to be irresponsible. 

All I do these days is work on growing my business and at the end of the day.. I go home and just try to find something to do. Watch TV, Reddit, work out, play a video game. It's just not satisfying. It's lonely. And since I fucked shit up with the girl I was seeing it's even worse and I realized how much I really liked her.

My brother had the good sense to leave the country so it was just my parents and I.  Due to my recent divorce, it was the first time in several years I had experienced a family Xmas so I had almost forgot how balls to the wall ridiculous my parents could be.

I didn't realize that divorce = coal in one's stocking.  I am not even remotely a materialistic person but when your sibling receives a $300 watch and you receive a DVD boxset, the disparity is hard not to note.

The constant references to my ex were charming as well.  I made a mistake in marrying him.  At least I had the courage to admit said mistake and didn't insist on toughing it out.  I mean what if we had kids and he physically abused them into their teen years and emotionally abused them at every given oppourtunity?!  Oh wait that sounds familiar...

The cherry on this holiday from hell happened five minutes before I left the house to go to the airport.  I joked that I wanted to take the dog with me and in front of extended family my father shouted at me that how could I take the dog if I was too broke to feed myself (not exactly accurate, although my ex did leave me $13000 in debt).  Ahhhhh!  Nothing like humiliation first thing in the morning.

So now I'm sitting in the airport, waiting for my flight back to city I'm currently living in while I do grad school (a soul crushing experience), feeling like a massive pile of crap.

I have a roof over my head but I have no sense of ""home"" and I never really have.  What an awesome realization to have over the holidays.

Well the store is in bad shape. We don't have a Store Manager, everyone is new. I have been there the longest. I work about 32 hours a week when everyone else works more than that, but I also have school.
I normally close the store and all the ""important"" stuff happens during the day when I'm in school. Only one of my coworkers updates me on what's going on.
I'm just a 3rd key holder, so I'm near the bottom of the management totem pole. Which is fine by me.

But the past couple of weeks I have been disrespected, unappreciated, and disregarded by two of my coworkers. I guess one of them is aiming for the assistant management position if our current AM gets bumped up to store manager.
I was blatantly scoffed at for my taste in music, I've been talked down at, etc.
I was having a rough day and just needed a minute to gather my thoughts but one of my coworkers just would not leave me be and ended up making me snap. She proceeded to email the DM about my ""rude behavior"" and my ""desire to do things my own way.""

I found the email on accident and was filled with brief rage.
Then I let it go.

I proceeded to email the DM about what's been going on at the store. The fact that people aren't following the rules and what not. Things being done incorrectly, etc. Without using names. I was just being professional about it.
(Examples, so you know what I mean;
People using cellphones on the floor, not just texting but actual phone calls. Leaving trash out on the floor instead of picking it up, not recovering. Not counting down the register during a shift change. The register coming up short on busy days/nights. Hiding in the back room. Leaving to run errands unrelated to work (things other than getting something to drink, smoke break, bathroom break, or the actual lunch break. One of them even went shopping!) Not taking the deposits daily like it ought to be done. ...things like that)
She never responded to my email.
I felt better after sending the email.

But now I'm getting paranoid and nervous that I might be let go from the position or something because of the whole thing. I know they wont get rid of me now but I'm worried I might have to look for new work after the holidays.

TL;DR I sent an email to the DM to inform her of what's going down at the store. Now I'm scared I'll be let go after the holidays because of it.

I lost my girlfriend of 2 years in a car accident in August. She was my whole life, we'd lived together for almost 18months rarely spending any time apart. We had everything planned out, from when we'd get married, to living/working overseas and when we'd have our first child. We talked about these things almost every single night.

With the help of friends I managed to survive the initial shock &amp; the funeral, however I constantly contemplated suicide. The support from my friends eventually dwindled and I found myself alone for the first time in our apartment over the last couple of weeks. I wasn't eating or sleeping to any routine and was feeling worse and worse until one night I really wanted to end it all. I decided to write a suicide note explaining my actions, However whilst writing, it really impacted me how this would affect my family and friends. I felt terrible making them go through what I was going through. After some hours of being very upset I experienced what I feel was a panic attack, then drifted to sleep. Over the next few days I dodged phone calls until a female friend who was close to my girlfriend asked to catch up for dinner the next day, I agreed and was actually looking forward to some human contact. 

The next day came and an hour before we were going to meet up I crashed my motorcycle and broke my collarbone. I was taken to hospital where I stayed overnight and the girl offered to go to my apartment and pick up some clothes etc. Whilst at my apartment she found the note, she didn't say this to me but took it upon herself to inform my dad and my best friend.

When I got out of hospital on the weekend, my dad (who normally lives 400km away) would only agree to go home if I agreed to stay with this girl, which I did and is where I am now. This morning she convinced me to speak to a psychologist at the hospital which I was very apprehensive about and he has started me on antidepressants and is organising ongoing treatment. I really don't know what to expect in the coming days, weeks, months, years. I still that feel I will never be happy without her.

My stepmother has pulmonary fibrosis (her lungs are hardening) and a whole mess of other things wrong with her, I can't remember them all. I am unable to see them very often because they live a little over 150 miles from me, and I have no means of income so it's even more difficult than it was before to make the trip. Shortly after I graduated high school, her and my dad had an argument and the stress made her illness worse and she went to the hospital. (It was not a physical fight, my dad is not stupid enough to hit her.) They sent her to ICU because of her condition, and she went on life support. They kept her under heavy sedation and had to restrain her wrists so she wouldn't rip the breathing tube in her throat out while she was asleep. She was on life support for over a week. Whenever we would visit her, her eyes would flutter open, but only for a moment before the nurses rushed in and shooed us out the door. They didn't want her to wake up, because her heart rate would go up and she would try breathing on her own. Understandable in a way, a lot of things could go wrong if her heart rate got too high.

I arrived at my dad's house the day after she had gone to the hospital, and I had only been filled in on what was going on with my stepmother. Turns out my dad had a little mishap of his own. My little sisters were told not to tell me what had happened, because he knew I would be furious. And I was. After a few days though, dad finally decided to tell me. After the argument between him and my stepmom, dad decided he was going to get drunk. Bad idea, he's an ex-alcoholic. He also has multiple emotional and psychological problems, and takes several different medications just to get through the day. I'm assuming he blamed himself for stressing her out so badly that she ended up on life support, but i'm not sure. I didn't pry too much into his reasoning, he does what I do and keeps everything bottled up inside. And i'm not sure how to say this, I've only told a few people about this, but I need to just say it and get it off my chest because the more I think about it, the more it bothers me.

He went into the backyard, and hung himself from a tree.

It didn't kill him however, he was caught, and the rope was cut. He was taken to the hospital, but suffered no severe injuries and was sent home.

The day before I left to go back home, my stepmom came off of life support with no complications. She was breathing on her own, but still in somewhat shaky condition. I felt bad for leaving, but I honestly could not handle staying down there too much longer--I love them all very dearly, but it's very stressful visiting them. Not to mention, most of the people in the house (though they're full-grown adults) don't even bother working, and I felt awful staying down there and not contributing anything. So I went home.



About two weeks ago, I got a call from my dad. He was going to the hospital. Apparently, he had been having severe stomach pains for a long time and just ignored them so he could continue to provide for his family. When dad went to the hospital, they did an upper GI, and found an ulcer in his stomach the size of a golf ball. When they did a biopsy, the doctor said it looked cancerous, but they wouldn't know for sure until the test results came back two weeks later. I'm not sure if he has received the results or not.

Yesterday morning, he told my mom that my stepmother was going to the hospital again. This did not surprise me, as she's been in and out of the hospital frequently. Then today, I answered when he called. She was in the hospital because she had pneumonia, but was being rushed to emergency surgery, she had a perforated bowel.

I'm just worried that with her lungs and body in as bad shape as it is, and her having pneumonia on top of it, she won't survive the surgery. Even if she does, it won't be for very long.

If it turns out he does have cancer, I don't know what they're going to do--they can't survive off of his disability checks alone.

We met in college, and both had ""trouble letting go"" of our exes during our first few months as a couple.  However, fast forward 3+ years and now we're a serious couple - living together, talking engagement rings, the whole bit.

I picked up his phone last week to check the weather and found explicit text messages to a random girl who he went to high school with - she's now recently married and has a two year old.  Looks like the two of them have been chatting for a few weeks...nothing more than talking, but disturbing and dirty conversations nonetheless.

This man is my life. There was no doubt in my mind that I would grow old with him. I want to forgive him and move on, but I'm a very practical person and so my rational head won't leave my heart alone. I don't know how to be normal anymore, and just when I think I'm okay with it, I feel like someone has ripped the band-aid off and it hurts all over again.

What do I do? We share an extremely ""quaint"" 500 sq. ft. apartment, everything in it, our families, friends, everything. I can't bear to think about throwing that all away, but the last thing I want is to look like a fool.

I'm a new redditor - show a girl some love?

___________________________________________________________
**EDIT**:
It's now been a week since we talked about it. I actually just confronted him while he was in the shower, started crying and fled to the other room. He came flying out of the bathroom and did nothing but apologize for an hour. No excuses, but a few tears on his end and a complete panic-stricken face. In the past few days I've had several melt downs, and every time he has listened to me and responded with how much he loves me and what an idiot he was. How he can't imagine losing me - how scared that idea makes him. I've pressed and pressed and the only reason for his actions he could come up with was that we both work so much (and consequently our sex life isn't as intense as it used to be) that when this woman initiated flirtatious conversations he got wrapped up in talking to her. The man truly seems like he's come out of a trance and can't believe he's done something so destructive. That being said, this whole head vs. heart thing is still plaguing me. I know this could have been much worse, and I do believe that his conscience would have intervened before doing anything physical, but I know that I could never have done what he was able to do, and that scares me. Am I an idiot to stay? He says that he would understand if I left, but begged to stay and let him work to fix things and make us ""us"" again. Can we be ""us"" again? Is it possible for this to have brought him to the shocking revelation of just what ""us"" means to him? If I ride off into the sunset with him, will he be prince charming who has learned his lesson and has adopted the ""i could do anything, but i want to do the things that make her feel happy and secure"" attitude?

I was dating and in love with someone who she didn't care for and she felt like keeping him in my life was me choosing him over her.

When we eventually broke up, I started dating someone new, but after a few months it was pretty clear to me that he wasn't right for me. The day before I planned to end it, I got a call from my ex and ended up sleeping with him (which is absolutely still cheating even if I had plans to end my current relationship and yes, I do feel awful about it).

In the few months I was dating guy #2, he and my best friend became friendly. She was angry at me for letting guy #1 back into my life and guy #2 was mad at me for ending our relationship, so they went out for drinks to commiserate. 

I was clearly uncomfortable with this, but she swore up and down that they were just friends, she had no interest in him, she wasn't at all attracted to him, and promised nothing would ever happen between them. She also argued that just like she couldn't make me stop being friends with guy #1 (even though she certainly tried), I couldn't make her stop being friends with guy #2. 

So I did my best to accept it and went out of my way to be friendly to him when he was around (while he ignored me and never made eye contact) as well as listening to her stories about their friendship. They quickly became best friends and she was no longer around at all.

After about two weeks she confronted me and said that I was not trying hard enough in our friendship and I was pulling away. I explained that I wasn't comfortable with her being best friends with my ex, but I had been trying as hard as possible to be ok with it. She on the other hand told me she was uncomfortable with guy #1 being in our apartment and I wasn't even allowed to mention his name. Due to the fact that she only talks about guys (and her health problems, anxiety, etc.) I felt that I didn't really have anything to connect with her on. This blew up into a huge argument where she screamed at me that I was a bad friend. 

We made up, but there was clearly some tension and when our lease was drawing to a close we decided it would be best for our friendship to seek other living arrangements. 

Last night, she sent me a TEXT telling me that she couldn't hold it in any longer. She was in love with guy #2, they had been dating for a while, and that she wasn't trying to hurt me. She said that she thought it would just be casual sex, but they fell in love (like casual sex wouldn't be a betrayal?).

Interestingly, my biggest issue is not with the relationship, it's with the lying and cowardice. If she had come to me like an adult when she started developing feelings for him, it would have been difficult, but I would have eventually accepted the relationship, just as I was accepting the friendship. Instead, she TEXT me the night before she moved out, when she knew I wouldn't be home, and told me me that she'd been hiding this from me for a month. According to her the ball was now in my court.

Now I've decided that she is not someone I need to have in my life. She hasn't been the same person for a while. I can understand why it happened certainly - she has really low self esteem and daddy issues and therefore needs as much love and affection as possible and doesn't care where it comes from (married men at work, my brother, my ex boyfriend, you name it). She felt like I had chosen guy #1 over her so she justified it to herself.

My issue is the feeling of betrayal. I trusted her completely and even though we had been having issues, I NEVER thought she would do this. Is betrayal just inevitable in every relationship? Are people really only out for themselves? How can I trust the other people in my life when I've clearly been so wrong in the past?

And is this my fault? I've certainly made mistakes. Maybe I wasn't as good a friend as I could have been. Do I deserve this?

And how do I deal with this? We haven't spoken. I never responded to her text. I'm not going to see her before she moves out today. Should I just give up and forget she exists? Should we have a conversation (and inevitably an argument because she never admits fault) with her for some sort of closure?

I just feel so lost and confused.

About 2 years when I started high school I had just gotten involved in the schools marching band. I had been a drummer for a while and wanted to try something new. At that point in time, all the kids in the school had a huge amount of respect for the program and there were so many awesome people involved, and they all were really cool and just knew how to have a good time. For the first two years I loved it. I was making so many new friends, I felt amazing because that was a new experience for me. I was friends with everyone in my section. I met my first girlfriend in the program, it was just amazing.

Then last year that girl ended up breaking my heart and I got depressed for a while. Since then a lot of my friends from the activity graduated, and now it's my senior year and I have lost all of my friends. Everyone in my section is either still in junior high, and those close to my age are assholes. I don't like the activity as much as I used to. I'll admit, this activity was a huge part of high school for me. 

I've gotten to the point where I don't really have many people to talk to. I am completely over my last girlfriend, I have a few good guy friends still, but I feel like the last time I had a real conversation with a girl was ages ago. Many of them decide to never respond to me if send them a message of any kind. I feel lonely because sometimes it feels like no one ever wants to talk to me. I just want to get myself back out there and feel as good as I did two years ago.

Ok so based on your suggestions in that last thread, here's my break up letter now:

There's something i have to say.  You know, when you said you loved me and wanted to marry me, I didn't know you meant it. No one's ever told me they love me for real, my friends tell me they love me every day. I don't understand how you love me for real, you don't even know me. You have no idea what I'm like. Like you literally just talked to me and you're already in love with me. I don't get it. Its too much for me. You said that my quotes saved your life, but that's not me, that's just the stuff that inspires me.

I have severe anxiety and I do a lot things impulsively out of fear without thinking. I'm not depressed, but a lot of stuff that happens in my life scares the shit out of me, cause I don't usually know what to do. I wanted to tell you all this before but I'm really afraid of hurting you. I feel so fucking awful right now, I'm so sorry for misleading you.

Look, don't get me wrong, I like you, I really do, you're really sweet and caring. It's just that I'm not looking for a relationship right now. And a relationship between you and me can't work out. We live like 6 hours away and barely know each other. Look everything will be fine don't worry, I'll be here if you need anything. I used to be depressed. But I soon started to realize that one day everything will be ok, things don't stay the way they are forever, the future has so much to offer. Here's a quote that ought to help you: ""Going through hell? Keep going.""
 
I'm going to send it to her soon. Once I do I'm blocking her on instagram. And on Kik, I'm going to change my name and avatar. So now I'll be safe. They can never find me if she commits suicide.

Something unsettling just happened. She told me she's going to be staying in my town for 5 days. I have no idea if its because of me. But now I feel worse. This has gone really far. Shit just got real. I have to send it.

Soooo, could you all give me some suggestions on how to improve my letter?

My schizophrenic brother who I've had some traumatic experiences with comes home from the hospital on weekends and in a month my younger sister who is a very ""my-way-or-everyone-suffers"" sort of person is moving back in a month until she can finish getting her house built (3+ months). Soooo, my home life is extremely stressful for me. Oh did I mention that my older sister is married and making 300 000$ annually combined income and my younger sister is engaged and has a job lined up for when she graduates; I love when I hear the ""So when are you getting married?"", like rubbing it in my face that I can't find a SO that can handle all my crazyness.

I cannot seem to find a job in my field. Doesn't sound like such a big deal, but ever other person from my graduating class has a job at this point and is literally loving it. I have had 7 ish interviews and two of those have said they'd love to have me; one wanted more experience, the other just didn't have an opening... then both places posted a job ad.

I'm currently in the process of waiting for a call back from a call center position, but as my degree is in a technical field, I am losing practical skills the longer I stay away. I'm honestly not sure I can DO the call center job with my odd anxiety issues as I've only ever done e-mail call center stuff before but I've got to try as I've got a pricy private health plan and medication that I 100% cannot get off of.

My other 'friends' are just labeled that because I speak to them on occasion due to sharing a class or something. The loneliness is amplified by the fact is summer vacation.

The one person I'm able to hold an actual conversation with is offline. He's probably my best friend and we don't even talk that often.

Any conversations I have seem so forced. I say hey, ask them how they're doing and the conversation proceeds very little after that. Most of the time, it's me pushing to continue the conversation.

Everyday is the same routine, sit at my computer and play games, occasionally go on facebook and see how happy everyone is, feel like shit.

Fuck, I just want someone to talk to. I want someone I can talk to nearly everyday so I don't recede into my shell and go mad from loneliness.

I'm home with my family for the summer for college, which is basically 90 days of my mom and sister insulting me for every little thing because...I don't know why. I guess I'm an easy target because I tend to make the most screw-ups in the family. I don't have a job and I've applied to every non-fast food place that would hire just for the summer in town and no calls back. I *could* get a job at my old workplace, but the boss and some of the workers there are pretty emotionally abusive and it's a terrible hellhole, so it's basically Home 2.0, but I don't attempt to stand up to people I don't know. I walk away and cry in the bathroom. Cue more insults from my mom and sister for being unable to find a job. ""Worthless"", ""lazy"", ""failure at life"", ""never going to do anything with your life"", and ""loser"" are common. Also, apparently everyone hates me because I'm rude, which is why no one will hire me. I don't understand how someone could tell that from a paper application, but whatever. I've told my mom that I have depression and she told me I should just suck it up and get over it because she did and anyone who dwells on it is a loser. I'm not stupid; I can easily see that she's hiding it very well.

I don't have friends and I don't have any way of getting out. I'm that broke. Even with a job, 60 to 100 percent of my paycheck goes to paying for a car loan and insurance because I decided it would be a *great idea to buy a new car for some godforsaken reason*. See, another screw-up. I also have to take a five-hundred dollar summer class which I have to pay out of pocket for, because I messed up in college. Screw-up. Not to mention the hundred dollar fine I have to pay to my college because I ""had a virus on my computer that they detected"". I contested it and they said an anti-virus scan wasn't good enough. Another screw-up. My birthday money gets to pay for the fine that isn't fair. Fuck money.

Anyways, this all comes back to my birthday because it's the day I'm usually tormented the most. I guess the logic is that I'm getting older and more worthless. I really wish I could do *something* that is worth something. I guess I should give up and go back to food service, but it looks terrible when applying for jobs after college that my only experience is food service, especially since I am getting a liberal arts degree (another screw up!).

I really don’t know how much more I can take…,13,0,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/1ex5cb/im_done_i_really_dont_know_how_much_more_i_can/,"I am so physically and emotionally drained at this point, so I’m sorry if this comes off as more rambling than anything.  The last 6 months have just been too much to deal with, and if it wasn’t for 3 specific people, I probably couldn’t go on anymore…  I’m sorry this is as long as it is (typed up in Word before posting):

-	Depression: On and off, I’ve battled with depression.  About 2 years ago, my doctor whom I trusted and actually liked as a person moved to California (I live in Connecticut), and I haven’t found a new primary care doctor yet.

-	Medical issues: I suffer from insomnia and migraines, and the migraines just seem to be getting worse.  I have to see a pain management specialist every month who prescribes pain killers.  Unfortunately I end up needing more than I’m given, but I don’t want to ask for anything else for fear that I’ll become completely addicted/dependent, and I don’t want my doctor to think I just want them recreationally.  Also, as of 3 weeks ago, I’ve had constant back pain, and was diagnosed at the ER with degenerative disc disorder (same thing my mom’s had 5 surgeries to help fix).

-	Job: My current job is more rewarding, but pays less than I have made in the past.  I lost my previous job in October 2011, and just started here about a year ago.  Also, I’m starting to get bored, and therefore I’m slacking in areas I should excel at.  I’m a member of management, and my bosses are very understanding, but I know there’s only so much they will take before booting me (more on that later)

-	6 months ago, my mom was told she needed another surgery on her cervical disc (this is her 5th back surgery and the 4th on her cervical disc; she has degenerative disc disease).  This got scheduled for April 17th.

-	A lot of my old debts are continuing to add up from when I was out of work.  My credit is beyond just “bad” at this point, and like I said, I’m making less than I used to, so it’s hard to even keep up with my regular bills.

-	I was excited because I only had 1 payment left on my car.  I had planned on paying it off and saving for a year to put a down payment on something I really wanted.  In March, I went to go start it, and it didn’t start.  Apparently, the timing chain broke (they replaced belts with chains in a lot of cars so they WOULDN’T break).  This blew out the engine, and the car was basically totaled (it would have cost me more to fix this than the car was even worth).  I sold the car online, and had to use that money to make my final payment, and send the guy the title.

-	I ended up renting a car for a month, which used ANY money I had extra (and then some).

-	Finally, my boyfriend was gifted a car from his father, so he let me use his old car.  Also, he said if I sell his car privately, I can use the money to put toward my down payment on something for myself.

-	About 2 weeks before my mom’s surgery, she was having stomach and chest pains.  She went to the ER.  They didn’t find anything, gave her additional pain medication (she is on pain management for her back already), and sent her home.

-	I had to bring my mom to the hospital for her surgery early in the morning on April 17th.  I couldn’t sleep the night before, so I was not only worried about her, but tired and unfocused.  I missed some things at work, and got scolded for it by my boss.

-	A week later, I went to the ER myself for major lower back pain.  After some scans, they found I also have degenerative disc disease, and will probably end up like my mom in a couple years.

-	A couple weeks ago, I got to work in my boyfriend’s car.  I went to a gas station in the middle of my day, and the car wouldn’t start back up.  I had to call my boss to pick me up and bring me back to work.

-	My mom isn’t supposed to be driving, and she had just purchased a brand new car (had 350 miles on it at that time).  She let me borrow it while I didn’t have one.

-	2 days later, my boyfriend’s car started back up.  I managed to bring it back to my work parking lot and vowed to sell it that weekend with an asking price of $2000 and listing all the issues I thought it had.

-	When someone came down to look at it, there were MANY more issues than I thought (oil leak, seal issues, starter issues, timing belt, etc.), and ended up only getting $1300 for it.

-	Last Friday, my mom was rushed to the ER in an ambulance because of the same chest/stomach pains.  She kept telling them it’s her gall bladder, but they refused to listen, did some seemingly unrelated tests which all came back negative, gave her more meds, and sent her home.  I missed another day of work.

-	Saturday and Sunday I went car shopping, was declined at 2 dealerships outright, and finally found something I absolutely love at a 3rd and they said they could get me a loan with the $1300 down.  I gave them a deposit to hold it while they get bank approval.

-	Monday morning, my mom was rushed to the hospital yet again (again, I missed work).  Finally, they did some appropriate tests and found out it WAS her gall bladder.  They admitted her to the hospital and scheduled surgery for Tuesday (scheduled for 12:00pm, finally went in at 5:30pm due to timing issues with the surgeon).

-	On Wednesday, I get a call from the dealership stating they need $1900 for the bank to approve me.  At that point I thought I wouldn’t get the car after all.  My boyfriend surprised me and said he was able to borrow the money from his boss.  I called the dealership back and told them I could do $1900.

-	The doctors told my mom she was going home on Wednesday.  She said she wasn’t ready, but the doctor is forcing it.  She was highly upset.

-	From Monday to Wednesday, my mom’s dog wasn’t as active as she normally is (she’s a 14 year old, 90 lb, black lab/German shepherd mix).  When my mom got home on Thursday, the dog was in major, major pain.  My mom and brother broke down, and my mom had to call the vet to see her.  The dog was in major pain, and they ended up putting her down last night.  I spent another night over her house on suicide watch for both her and my brother.  My mom feels she killed her best friend, and my brother blames himself for not being able to take care of her.  I tell them both to remember the good times, it's no one's fault, and she is no longer in pain...

-	They messed up the date on my mom’s post-surgery script, and I had to spend an hour in the ER at 10:00pm to get it fixed.

-	Today, I’m at work, and I’m finally caught up from missing Monday.  I get a call from the dealership saying I got the car, and I should come down with the $2900.  Apparently she meant I need an ADDITIONAL $1900 to the other $1300 down.  I told her I can’t do that, and I can’t get the car after all.

I’m trying to be strong for my mom and brother for loosing their dog, and to help her feel better for her surgeries, but I can’t take it anymore.  I’m physically and emotionally drained.  I still can’t seem to get a car no matter how hard I try, and I feel I can’t deal with everything I’m dealt at this point.  If it wasn’t for my brother, my best friend, and especially my boyfriend, I honestly wouldn’t be alive to type this.  I’m still at work, and had to excuse myself to the bathroom several times just so my employees don’t see me breaking down.  Last night and this morning, I'm trying to make my mom and brother feel better.  M

Really, I’m hoping getting this all off my chest will help MMFB…

1369126736.0,14,self.MMFB,1er5yk,My uncle just died and a fellow driver's actions/words cut me to pieces unexpectedly.,15,1,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/1er5yk/my_uncle_just_died_and_a_fellow_drivers/,"**warning**: includes some vulgar swearwords which were the other driver's words.

**TDLR**: from a close family, uncle died of lymphoma complications, paranoid that it's somehow my fault, drove home to take care of parent's dogs, I (20F) was cut off by another and after giving him the finger he called me a ""fucking cunt."" Also, I'm really sorry for the length of this.

**the back story**

My family's an incredibly close Irish Canadian type family, in that we are Catholic's who for the most part all live within a 10km (6mile) radius of each other and my parent's generation/my aunts and uncles all grew up on the farm together. Very simple, wholesome, close family.

There's this one uncle I have who lives across the field with my aunt/godmother. When my dad was being treated for leukemia as a young child, I stayed at their house. So add that onto the already close bond, mix in with years of playing at their house - I grew attached to my uncle and similarly, godmother.

At some point, don't know when exactly (before high school at least) my uncle was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. He battled it on and off for years, there were bad points but he was always strong, a fighter, and battled through. Enter the start of this school year. He was bad, in ICU in Toronto hospitals where I visited with my dad, but then he got better for a bit. Came home, had to go back in. Worried, he got better, then worse at our local hospital. 

I left home (still live with parents, attend local university, poor student, etc) to house sit for a week starting last week. I missed his decline while away apparently and my mom gets a hold of me and tells me my uncle's in ICU again, in palliative care, and if I could would I please take care of the dogs tonight. It's a stat holiday here in Canada, so of course as a part timer my lovely minimum wage coffee slinging job has me scheduled and even though I wanted to, I couldn't see my uncle right away. Blessing in disguise though, holiday meant work was slow and the supervisor needed someone to leave because we weren't making enough money so I volunteered. Headed to the hospital, called my sister to ask her to explain what this meant but got voicemail, saw all my aunts and uncles. Saw my uncle and godmother.

He was so small, skinny, and frail. Curled in his bed. He was a tall man, a huge stride which I've always struggled to keep up with when on walks with the dogs, my dad, and him. But there he was, small. Fragile, hooked up to stuff, lying there. I could barely compose myself to hug my godmother and had to leave the room. Pick up a bag of comfort food on the way.

Eventually I had to leave, to take care of my family's dogs and the one I'm house sitting. I cry the whole way home, now away from my aunts, uncles, parents, and cousin. I shower in hopes of shaking it off - I didn't want to return to the house sitting job rattled because I was doing the job with the help of my boyfriend and my sister's boyfriend (sister's away for the summer). Put on a nice dress in hopes of feeling slightly better about something. Start driving back into town for house sitting. 

Get up to a light, there's a turning lane beside me which many people use to cut others off. Look at phone, missed call, look up and there's an SUV in the lane beside me. Just had that feeling he was going to cut me off. Voila, he does. But I didn't want him to get in first. I just wanted a win for the day. Was that too much to ask?

I lost my composure, usually I don't race jerks like this but just this once I wanted this win. I wanted it because my uncle was frail and I was afraid, sad, and unable to deal. I wanted it because I couldn't handle seeing my godmother cry, couldn't imagine how my dad must feel with this being his brother, and for my cousin's son who will never know his grandpa. I wanted it because I hate working at Tim Horton's, hate smelling of coffee, hate my manager who's a creep and see no end in sight. I hate that I'm not where I want to be money wise and that I need this coffee job desperately. I wanted it because my summer school class tomorrow is on probability theory and that was the single most hardest concept for me the first time I did this damn course.  I wanted it because despite the dress I did not feel good about how I looked and the guilt of the comfort food I had packed. I wanted it because my closest friend and big sister was unreachable in this time. I wanted it because I hate the city I was house sitting in and the dog which whines and eats the bagels I bought. I just wanted to be first in that lane. Just once.

But he won narrowly, of course, and had to cut in quick because another car was close ahead. So I gave him the finger. I'll admit that, I was defeated, and I do regret my action. I don't simply mean I lost, I was defeated. Down for the count, another strike to the ledger, fml. It seemed like a good idea then, it was in the heat of the moment and not a thing I was proud of or typically would do. I failed as a person and Canadian by acting so rudely, through racing and the bird flipping. We get to the next light and the guy is next to me, windows down as it's warm. He sarcastically claps. I flip another bird as I'm fighting tears behind my sunglasses. I hear him saying something loudly, angrily, and turn down my radio to hear him out. I hear the words ""you're a fucking cunt"" and snap.

The reason why I don't race people on the roads normally and flip birds is because of respect to other people. I see customers at the drive through who are complete assholes and try to think of what their day has been like - perhaps their boss is an asshole, maybe they don't get a fair break, what if they're getting all these chocolate doughnuts for their stressed out preggo wives, maybe they're going through a rough break up, maybe their parents were jerks and never taught them better, who knows. I look at everyone and believe each personis unique and fighting their own battles, living a life full of actions and reactions that lead to situations and I try not to judge based on small instances and make matters worse. I like to brighten days, look for optimism. I serve your coffee with a smile and genuinely care when I ask how was your day. Today wasn't that day though, my day was too sucky and I couldn't do it myself. But fuck it, I thought it was my day to teach this guy that lesson so I very quickly yelled right back ""thanks asshole, this is what I want while my uncle's dying in the hospital."" Light turned, I was in shambles after that. Yelling did not make things better and I just felt even more shittier. 

We'll fast forward the rest of the time. Meet up with boyfriend at that house, he's amazing and consoling and understanding. Hour or so passes. Mom calls. Uncle's dead. Boyfriend had to leave for the night, couldn't even kiss him good night because I have to tip toe and it reminded me of my uncle's height and how my godmother won't ever tip toe kiss him... Can't sleep, crying a lot, in a strange house, get to return home tomorrow but can't wait to cry in my own bed, can't deal well even though this sadly isn't a first funeral type thing for me. Grandma on other side died two months ago, lost all other grandparents before, and a cousin. feeling very stupid and childish because of the crying, hoping some reddit cat gifs or something. Just no moose or golf related things please. My uncle loved to hunt and play golf.

**A paranoid parrot appears**

Another reason why I'm unable to sleep because of all this is because about two weeks ago I delivered a food plate my mom wrapped up for my aunt to put in her fridge from when she came home from the hospital and I'm scared that this is all my fault. I've had a bit of a head cold the past week and my throat was sore in the morning that I delivered the plate. I'm afraid that since my uncle was so sick and vulnerable, his blood count was low, and that my sickness carried over to him via this plate of food which my aunt had and I'm afraid that this is all my fault.
