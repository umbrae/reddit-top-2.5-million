1375207343.0,26,self.castles,1jd2zf,Thoughts on building a castle today.,27,1,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/castles/comments/1jd2zf/thoughts_on_building_a_castle_today/,"Over the past year I've been a member of this sub I've seen some absolutely magnificent constructions, and it got me thinking. What would it take to build something similar today? Be it a mighty fortress, a majestic castle, or just a simple motte and bailey? So I conjured up a list of problems one needs to conquer, to make the dream of building your own castle possible. Now I invite you all to join me in this discussion; to share, answer, and retort with your own thoughts and ideas on how one can go about in building a castle.


**Preparations**

1. A plot of land. Castle's aren't very small so you need good space. Most would prefer to place it quite a bit from the rest of civilization so it isn't contrasted by the Walmart next door. The ground itself must be up to par, unless you are a bit of a gambler. What would the ideal place be to build? Where would you build your castle given the choice?
2. Permits. You obviously need to be allowed to build something as big as a castle, even if it is a small one. Depending on where you live it may or may not be rather difficult. But just how difficult would it be?
3. Construction. Someone needs to build that thing, and it will probably not be you. Hundreds, if not thousands of tons of rocks need to be hauled. Who would be able to take on such a project? 
4. (Courtesy of /u/pieeatingbastard [+2]) What is the purpose of the building you want to have done? Do you want to create something historically accurate, a nice defensive structure, or something purely aesthetic? Or maybe it is something else?


**Features** - This bit is more about personal preferences.

1. What kind of castle would you like to have built? A small medieval fort or a grand 17th century castle? There are tons of different styles to choose from, some options more expensive then others.
2. Moat? Drawbridge? Battlements? Spires? Towers? A dungeon? What would you like to see?
3. Modernisation. Given that we enjoy certain comforts that wasn't available a thousand years ago, how willing would you be to bring it into the castle? Running water, electricity, heating, and even internet? It would certainly ramp up the price. But maybe it depends on if you want to make it liveable or just a place for you to chill.


**Rounding it all up**

1. There will be many curious individuals that would like to take a closer look. How would you handle tourists and nosy neighbours? What are the social implications in owning (and building) your own castle? Would you lend parts of it out to production companies to record films? What would you do if you are approached by roleplay/LARP:ers and re-enactment enthusiasts?
2. How would you use it in a practical sense? Would you live there? How do you keep others out when you aren't there? If you live in something like [Carondelet castle](http://i.imgur.com/2YlWbMP.jpg) (posted by [Hoohill ~5 months ago here](http://www.reddit.com/r/castles/comments/1971qi/carondelet_belgium_this_small_medieval_castle_its/)), it would just be a matter of locking the doors. But if you have something bigger with walls, it might be a bit more difficult/tedious (unless you get a remote controlled drawbridge). 
3. How would one maintain it? 


**The Price**

Given the wide array of options we have in building ourselves a castle, the price could range from astronomical to not-too-bad-at-all. What would be a reasonable price you think? And what would the cost be for the smallest option, something like [this (no source, sorry)](http://i.imgur.com/NeojPvs.jpg)? How much would the upkeep be? It would probably take an enormous amount of energy to keep it heated over the winter. Burning wood is an option, but it would require massive amount of work to keep the temperature level, unless you only heat the necessary living quarters (kitchen and bedroom).


**That's about it!** There might be a point or two that I've missed, so if please fill me in and I'll add them to this post. All in all, this is a thread dedicated to the question: ""Is it feasible to build your own castle today?"" I like to dream about a day were I stumble upon a fortune big enough to build me something. Personally I would love to have a simple 3-story tower with a cellar and an open fireplace. There are many sources of inspiration to our designs, be it history, books, movies, and even games. *What is your source of inspiration?*",,False,self,t5_2qrft,1375280023.0,,,True,t3_1jd2zf,http://www.reddit.com/r/castles/comments/1jd2zf/thoughts_on_building_a_castle_today/,

I've done a lot of research myself, but I have a lot of questions unanswered or that I don't feel have been answered well by my own searching and reasoning.

As a brief bit of background, I'm writing a story and I want the castle the story centers around to be *good*. We all know what a bad castle is (I hope?) but what makes one good?

More specifically:

What would make you decide if you were going to build a castle in a given location? Alternatively, what would make you decide not to build a castle in a location where one would be useful?

I notice a lot of castles seem to be near streams or rivers, but what is to stop an enemy from cutting off access or poisoning the water in a siege?

What is to stop the enemy from simply leaving a force just big enough to keep the defenders from cutting their supply lines and then having the rest of their army march on? Am I grossly overestimating the size of a middle ages army at a few thousand?

Are the towns often seen near these castles built to protect the town, or did the town pop up because that area was better protected?

How many defenders is a realistic number for a large, strategically important castle? What do you do to store food, keep animals (like rats) from eating it all for you and what do you do with waste? I know about the garderobe for human waste, I'm thinking about things like the inevitable corpses, dead animals, and other general waste. On a related note, I cannot imagine the garderobe being very comfortable and it must certainly be the one of the most hated places in the castle.

Sieges, oh, sieges. What would help you decide if a castle was worth besieging or not? Some of the weaponry used in sieges is truly incredible, but was it really used that often? Or, was it mostly sitting around waiting for one side to surrender, starve to death, or die of horrible diseases? How useful would primitive cannon (called bombards?) be for the attackers / defenders? I found some examples where they were used with limited success such as the siege of Constantinople in 1453, but I cannot find examples on when they were failures - or what could go wrong with them. So, what could go wrong with early cannons? I understand they could explode, but wouldn't that be really rare?

In the event of a siege, how would the defenders attempt to get messages out and past the besiegers? How long of a siege would you plan for (as a defender) when building your stores, or would they just be as big as possible? How would the besieging force get supplied? As I understand it, logistics in the middle ages were not nearly as good as they are now.

How did you mitigate diseases in this age? Or was it just ""If he dies, oh well."" I understand that mortality rates were very, very high and primarily from disease. Was this limited to lower classes or everyone?

On a related note, I typed 'siege of Constantinople' into wikipedia and got redirected to 'List of sieges of Constantinople' so I thought there must be multiple cities with that name, then I realized it was all talking about one city...",,False,self,t5_2qrft,False,,,True,t3_1e8n42,http://www.reddit.com/r/castles/comments/1e8n42/some_castlerelated_questions/,

We love our castles and manors;

1) [This](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_xNhpqJQqR90/TIqbuM_sF-I/AAAAAAAAIZY/-5qTuEs_HeE/s1600/Brougham+Manor+1.jpg) is Brougham Manor, North Yorkshire (This is the only pic that wasn't my own, unfortunately we never got a pic from the outside)... It was a pretty lucky find, we went to visit Brougham castle originally but the entrance fee was around £15 each, too much for a passing visit. Just down the road though, was Brougham Manor. It's in the process of being restored, entry was just whatever you could afford, we made up for it with our tea and cake purchases.

The place was amazing, so many finds around each corner... [This](http://i.imgur.com/jhjNd.jpg) is the door knocker we came across on the outside walls.. Shame about the graffiti mind.

Pretty much the whole place is open to explore (you just have to step over a few of the builders to get to places, staff were amazingly friendly though), we came across an old [Jesus statue](http://i.imgur.com/nl24e.jpg) just chilling in a corner.

On our way back from visiting this we came across another place... Not strictly a castle so apologies for that, but a large manor house. The name completely escapes me, it's still in North Yorkshire though.

[This](http://i.imgur.com/M5RY5.jpg) place was huge, the main building was closed off but glancing through the windows they had what I'd hoped they'd have, huge paintings across the walls, elaborate chandeliers, huge dining tables.  

[View looking out from the main entrance](http://i.imgur.com/W7zeE.jpg).

[This is around the back of the building](http://i.imgur.com/NdPVO.jpg) in the gardens... We only had an hour before they closed the gates up so we couldn't get around to seeing everything.

[There were 3 of these](http://i.imgur.com/bLvt4.jpg) that we saw scattered across the grounds, inside each were just a lone table with a chair.

And finally, [bonus pic](http://i.imgur.com/Mtm54.jpg) of me on a swingset that was within the gardens.",,False,self,t5_2qrft,False,,,True,t3_16b685,http://www.reddit.com/r/castles/comments/16b685/just_found_this_subreddit_few_pics_from_summer/,
