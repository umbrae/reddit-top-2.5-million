1370025091.0,83,self.appletv,1ff30i,Plex on AppleTV 3 Without Jailbreak or AirPlay is now Possible,88,5,42,http://www.reddit.com/r/appletv/comments/1ff30i/plex_on_appletv_3_without_jailbreak_or_airplay_is/,"A couple of fine folks over in the Plex forums have created a tool called PlexConnect:

&gt;The basic idea is, to:

&gt;re-use a native AppleTV app (in this case Apple Trailers)

&gt;re-route the Trailers app requests to your local Plex Media Server

&gt;re-work the reply to fit into AppleTV's XML communication scheme

&gt;let iOS do the rest

&gt;enjoy Plex on your unmodified AppleTV


Quite a nifty little trick that works wonders.  Haven't seen it mentioned on here anywhere so I thought I'd just post as I'm sure many people (like myself) use their AppleTV almost exclusively for Plex.

Apple TV $109
HDMI Cable $20

Physical setup took 5 minutes. Power connected, HDMI cable to my stereo receiver (it does video switching.) Apple TV has an optical out for TosLink, so you could the HDMI direct to a TV then use the optical to a receiver for digital audio if needed. This would be necessary where you have audio/video lag – where the words you hear don’t line up with the mouths you see.

Software setup took another 5 minutes, using the included remote to configure the wireless network (optional Ethernet is available,) then add my Apple ID.

My home network has 2 routers, multiple VLANs, DHCP/DNS running from a Windows Server with filtered forwarders (stopping kids from accessing inappropriate sites), and ISA Server 2006 for my VPN connection to my home network from remote and internet monitoring (again, kids sucking up all the bandwidth.) Apple TV had ZERO issues with my non-standard home setup. It just worked. 

Anything I have syncing to the iCloud, my purchased iTunes tracks/albums, photo stream, they were all immediately available on Apple TV. On my desktop running iTunes, I enabled Home Sharing and immediately got access to my entire library, all music, all videos,  my photos. Whatever is shared in iTunes is accessible on the TV. 

It has built-in Netflix and other streaming capabilities, but I don’t subscribe to any of them. I’ll just assume that it works as well as every other method of streaming from those content providers.

The iPad to Apple TV is probably the coolest part, for me anyway. Any media playing on my iPad, be it in the music app, video, my SiriusXM internet player, or 3rd party player, can be streamed from the iPad to the TV and stereo. It also has the option to mirror the display (and sound) of the iPad on the TV. I have played games and put it on the TV so others can see. I have a flyer app that I use for all the big retailers, so if I saw something interesting, I can just toss it up on the TV so everyone in the room can see it, no need to have everyone crowd around me, or pass around my iPad. Basically you can just extend the iPad display and sound to your home theatre. 

Multiple accounts are also supported on Apple TV. I setup my wife’s account, so all her purchases from iTunes and her laptop’s iTunes Library are available on Apple TV too. Flipping between accounts is really simple. It can save or not save your passwords for your Apple ID – useful if you have a credit card linked to your account and children accessing the device.

Screensaver options include some built-in stuff from National Geographic, movie posters or photos from your iTunes Library. There is a Flickr option too, which I really liked. I configured Flickr for my screensaver, to my personal account. You could link it to anyone’s public Flickr stream, or you can have it search for keywords and display what it finds. (Note: there is no content control for the Flickr part, so if you search for something, it will be shown. This includes any nudity/pornographic images which do not have appropriate Flickr flags set on them.)

The Remote app from the App Store is not required, but handy (after initial setup.) It makes typing things into the search/config screens fast. The included remote control input is like using the controller on your gaming console to input stuff – find letter, click, find letter, click.

My daughter’s Apple ID was not added to the device, but she can still stream music/video/display stuff to the box from her iPod (4th gen.) She buys her music from iTunes directly on her iPod, so I don’t need to have her iCloud available on the TV. This will save on bandwidth for those of us who don’t have an unlimited plan.

The audio and video “channels” are separate on Apple TV. I was playing music alone from my iPad to the box, and my daughter was able to show pictures from her camera roll, both just worked. The only thing that bugs me is if there is a second request for either “channel”, Apply TV just moves to the latest request. So if you wanted to be childish, two people could just fight with the broadcast function… My tunes/her tunes/my tunes/her tunes… and on and on and on…. That’s probably my only issue with it.

I have not done any testing with it for say access to Windows Media Center – But I could. I’ve just always used iTunes to manage my library. There are other things shown on the Apple TV home screen, I just haven’t played with them yet.
 
So for $130+tax, I’m most pleased with it. It does everything I wanted it to, and more… I would have to say it’s probably one of the best “accessories” for iPad/iPhone/iPod.

I mentioned one in another thread, but I'll bring it up here and list a few more:

- If you have an Android phone or tablet you can, essentially, add more ""channels"" to your ATV with certain apps. I tried a few and iMediaShare is the one I love. (I use the Lite version. Free is good. lol) This adds the ability to stream any photos/videos/music on my phone to my ATV. It adds channels like: Funny Or Die, TED talks, Break, Facebook, NASA, Vimeo. (I think it's also available in the Apple store.)
- If you like Jeopardy or Wheel of Fortune, the iMediaShare Lite has a Dailymotion channel and those shows are uploaded the next day, faithfully, by some random user in HD. (There are a few other shows on there, too, like older Doctor Who.)
- You can stream Sirius/XM satellite radio via AirPlay which adds tons of commercial free radio stations to your ""ATV experience."" haha. Don't have Sirius/XM? Don't have Sirius/XM? Turns out you can get a ""free 30 day trial"" at https://siriusxm.com/ondemand - without needing to enter a credit card. Just, essentially, a name, email address and zip code. You can rinse and repeat at the end of any free trial. (I wish they'd add a Sirius/XM channel though. Can't stream from my Android devices.)

So there are just a few things I do and watch to enhance my ""experience."" Anyone have shows they watch via alternative apps and airplay? Or have other tips?

Other shows I watch via the 'Dailymotion' channel from the app:

- Mrs. Browns Boys (HILARIOUS Irish sitcom. Seriously, watch it. Even if you have trouble understanding the accent for a little bit you will enjoy this.)
- Burnistoun (Scottish sketch comedy TV show.)
- Biggest Loser Australia (OK, I love accents. MasterChef Australia (search for MCAU) is also good.)
- Frozen Planet (amazing and beautiful documentary)
- Outnumbered (people who like shows like Modern Family will dig this.
- Primeval (really awesome science fiction TV show. Good special effects.)

Other shows I've seen episodes of on there (not recommendations): Here Comes Honey Boo Boo, Dynamo Magician, Gordon Ramsay's Ultimate Cookery Course, Goosebumps, Mork and Mindy, Bosom Buddies... In fact, just searching for the phrase ""s01e01"" will find many shows for you.

Still, I was hesitant because the files go through the iPad before entering the TV through AirPlay, resulting in loss of quality and/or lag. I was wrong, the picture was perfect 1080p and the streaming didn't lag at all. Best of all I don't have to convert from MKV to MP4 at all. It just plays my 8 GB MKV file no problem. Not only that, but my 5th generation iTouch can also stream to my TV without any loss or lag. I can't believe it's this easy and awesome.

Planning to watch the entire Star Wars series in BluRay quality!

EDIT:

A video and some pictures. Source file is an 8GB 1080p MKV. Movie is ""Moon"" directed by Duncan Jones.

It'll probably take a lot for me to fully understand how everything operates, so if you just want to quickly answer a question, this probably isn't the place for you.

Anyway. I've been reading about Plex, and how you can reroute some DNS dealies or something, and click on the ""trailers"" icon on appletv to access your files. 

Basically my parents have this gigantic DVD collection that just collects dust and takes up a whole lot of space. I was thinking I'd try to make their lives a little easier and more efficient. 

What I've pieced together, which is quite likely not the case and I'm misinterpreting something—is that I could take rip all these DVDs to an external hard drive (using something called Handbrake I think), plugg my drive into my router, and use Plex to access all of it via appletv. Is this at all doable? Am I completely missing something? 

Is Plex user friendly? Could I upload cover art, descriptions, and subtitles for everything? Could I have separate folders and categories? If I have 10 seasons of Friends, can I have a separate folder for each season? Is Handbrake easy to use? 

More importantly, is it *super* easy to use once everything is set up? Will my parents be able to access their library of movies as easily as they do stuff on Netflix via appletv? Is the technology not quite there yet? 

Lastly, if none of the above is possible, is there a different method to this that could work? 

For what it's worth, I have a *very* solid home internet connection. I'd be connecting the hard drive to the Airport Extreme in my room, and the appletv would be connected via ethernet to the Airport Express running on Bridge Mode in my living room. 

I'm not totally inept when it comes to technology. It's just that a lot of this media server stuff, including all the guides I've read and so-called ""beginner"" tutorials, feature a lot of jargon specific to this topic, and it gets to be overwhelming trying to piece it all together. 

**tl;dr:** I'm curious if there's a way to access files on an external hard drive connected to a router on an appletv via plex or other means. And also what this program called Handbrake is about. 


Edit: Is it possible to skip the external hard drive and use a Time Capsule?

I've spent hours and hours researching and trying different things over the past few years.

XBMC never worked well for me - icefilms (and now OneChannel) rarely work. I've tried various fixes, and they'll work for a few days, and then stop working again, either I can't browse the directories or the movies freeze during playback. I updated to V12 (Frodo) recently but it didn't seem to fix anything.

So I got Plex all setup and organized all my media on my local desktop. The shared library doesn't show up in Plex half the time, and when it does appear, a lot of the files simply won't play. The higher def (720p+) .mkv files have very choppy playback (lots of buffering) and tend to crash. XViD files seem to work okay, but overall I feel that most of the things I've tried have not worked well or consistently.

Has this been anyone else's experience? Is there something else I should try? This is kind of a long-winded rant, but I'd love to get setup with something that works consistently, and while I often see people singing the praises of the ATV and how versatile it is, I haven't seen any other threads like this on here.

If I want to play a movie I have on my computer, I usually use two options. I'll sometimes have it in iTunes^1 and then stream it through AirPlay to watch it on my television. 

Alternatively to iTunes, I use AirParrot. Because I have an older MacBook Pro that won't support Mountain Lion mirroring when I upgrade my OS, I use that application for mirroring. It's awesome. I can just plop VLC on my second desktop that is on the television screen to play any video file. 

I've noticed with AirParrot that if I am using a lot of bandwidth with other stuff, the audio and video stutters. I feel like it requires a lot of available bandwidth (I know a bit about Apple products, but please excuse my possible naivety towards network issues).

So if I alternatively just AirPlay a video to my Apple TV through my iTunes library, I feel like it's a smoother play. And it also allows me to continue doing whatever on my computer screen. But if it's a video that I had to convert to a mp4 or whatever, I probably lost some visual quality in doing so, correct? 

So what would you do in this situation? On a related note, I've also considering finding out how to investigate whether or not my Wi-Fi router is emitting the strongest signal possible? Does the router that the ISP gives you not necessarily provide the best 'bang for your buck'? 

If it helps, I have a 15"" MacBook Pro (mid 2010), 2.66GHz Intel Core i7, 8GB 1067MHz DDR3. Graphics card: NVIDIA GeForceGT 330M 512MB. Our ISP is Time Warner and supposedly gives us around 20mbps download, 2mbps upload. 3 computers and 3 mobiles on the network.

I just bought an Apple TV so I am working hard to convert all of my video to m4v.  Here are a few utilities I have found absolutely invaluable:

1. [Handbrake Batch Encoder](http://videoscripts.wordpress.com/downloads/) -- Everyone knows about Handbrake by now, but if you are trying to convert files in bulk (e.g. for a TV series) it takes a long time to add each file to the queue individually.  With Handbrake Batch Encoder, you can simply drag and drop any number of files and let the program do all of the heavy lifting.  This same website includes another utility that watches a given folder for any new files and automatically transcodes any of them to m4v, but I haven't tried that yet.

2. [MetaX for Windows](http://download.cnet.com/MetaX-for-Windows/3000-31714_4-75449693.html?tag=mncol;1) -- The iTunes tagger for video files is atrocious.  More often than not, adding artwork will hang iTunes, and trying to perform any sort of function on more than a few files at a time will hang it as well.

I've played around with a couple different options for concatenating the files, but none quite fit the bill.

How do you handle these types of movies? Do you leave them as two parts, or do you have an elegant solution for combining them? (Concatenating VOB files, then ripping with Handbrake; concatenating after the Handbrake rip; Quicktime; ffmpeg; something else entirely?) 

If there's a better suited subreddit for this question, please let me know.

Edit:

Many thanks to /u/Ream for guidance. The steps are very simple, I just didn't know the appropriate programs to use.

1. [MakeMKV](http://www.makemkv.com/download/) to rip the DVDs to separate mkv files. 

2. [MKVmerge](http://www.bunkus.org/videotools/mkvtoolnix/downloads.html) (part of the mkvtoolnix package) to combine the files into a single mkv. Add the first mkv, then *Append* (not Add) the second (and third, fourth, whatever) part onto the first. Don't just add all the files to the list.

3. [HandBrake](http://handbrake.fr/downloads.php) to convert the mkv from step 2 to an m4v. (Note that you may want to go to the Chapters tab and fix the numbering. Many multi-DVD movies start numbering their chapters from 1 again on the second disc.)

I was curious what options existed for additional features on a jailbroken ATV 2G.

I guess I should start by outlining my background, and requirements.

**My Requirements:**

* Plays divx, xvid, mkv, mov files
* Plays media from windows (SMB) shares
* Braindead simple (I am setting this up for my wife to use without help). I'm happy to sacrifice some functionality for ease of use, and a pretty UI (SSHing apps and features on a regular basis is pretty much out of the question).


**Wife's Requirements:** 

* ""I just want it to work""


**Nice to have:**

* Support for a metadata exchange service (ala MyMovies), so I can browse by cover art, actors, TV show series details, etc
* Spotify Support
* Subsonic Support


**My Background:**
I am very comfortable with Shell commands, SSH/SFTP, and iPhone jailbreaking. I don't know if the latter is applicable, but the ATV is a flavor if iOS, so who knows.


As far as I can tell, you can do Plex, XBMC, or NitroTV. I am not sure which one would be right for me, or if other options exist.

So my questions:

* Is 5.1/7.1 AAC somehow different or inferior over DTS 5.1/7.1?  I have used  [MkvToMp4](http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?t=163050) to convert my MKV's before I get into the stinky kettle of fish that is the variety of codecs the other half of my videos are encoded in.   I ask as the sound quality seems to be diminished, even though I have the 'normalize' box unchecked and the quality set to 1.0 instead of the standard .75 out of the box (What a dumb default).  It seems to lose some volume and the TV or my computer needs to be turned up to formerly scary volumes to hear voices.

* On a second machine, there is a huge library of photos, and it takes minutes to get the library and control back of the ATV.  That machine is on the LAN as is the ATV.  The photos have been added to that machines library, but to avoid duplication I don't have that machine set up to move things to central library.  They are spread across many directories, so subdividing further won't really help.

* Do you use Handbrake to convert your non-MKV files, and is there any tips for converting a huge library of video in varying containers and formats?  My end goal is simple, all my videos converted with zero quality loss, and full compatibility with Apple TV.

* Sort of an iTunes question, but I have never attempted to play HD videos in it until recently.  Why can't my i7-920 at 3.2ghz and 6 gigs of RAM play a converted 1080p movie in iTunes under Windows?  It even chokes regularly on 720.  Seems like a huge hole in the ecosystem if I have to go outside of iTunes to watch movies in my iTunes library in VLC.

* What is a good recipe for a home made thin crust pizza dough?

* I know there is no ATV3 JB yet, but now that 'people' are apparently 'working on it' I wonder if you might know something I don't.

* I would love a percentage of my pictures to be on the ATV3 locally.  I assume this is impossible which is why i didn't phrase it as a question, Alex.

Thanks for any input to any of my wonderings.

I was wondering if anyone is having the dilemma of choosing between buying a movie on iTunes or Bluray. Some of the pros and cons..

- Bluray - Low prices on certain movies, best quality video, can be re-sold, look nice on a shelf, but can be scratched and broken, takes up space, and might become old tech such as vhs tapes, and dvd's.

- Apple TV/iTunes movies - Durable (Your house can burn down, and you just re-download everything on your new pc) might outlast blurays, instant watching without switching disks, minimalistic cloud streaming takes up no space in house, but pricey movies, slightly lower frame rate, can't resell/borrow, always need a decent internet connection.

I wanted to know if anyone was having this physical vs digital movie issue. I like how my 150+ DVD collection looks, (and my VHS collection in the attic, but now with the HD and 3D movies coming out, I'm afraid of once again switching formats, and being outdated in a few years time.

I had the same problems on the older iTunes version, now on the new iTunes version.

Problem - I'm having problems playing movies and podcasts. Using the apple remote, I try to connect through home sharing to my pc. Typically having to shut down iTunes, then start back up for it to connect, Or sign off from home sharing then turn it back on. Then trying to play short video podcasts, about 5 minutes long. It will usually play the first one without a problem. Trying to play the second video, press play and it can take 5 minutes to 30 minutes for it to start playing- similar problems playing my full length movies.

I made sure my pc does not go into sleep mode or turn off hard drives. I also tried an apple forum suggestion to turn off ipv6 settings. Same results wireless and wired.

Here is what works, playing the same podcasts from the Internet via the at3, also sitting at my pc playing videos from my PC through the at3 works but I should be able to sit on the sofa and use my apple remote to play from my library.

Also, I have installed the Plex Media server and can play the same videos through my PS3 with no trouble, so I don't think it's a real network issue. I'm a programmer so I have tried everything I can think of to fix. 

Any suggestions on how to make videos play correctly?

Background:

I got my first HDTV last year ([this Samsung](http://www.samsung.com/us/video/tvs/UN46C6300SFXZA)), but the rest of my AV equipment is roughly a decade old now. In particular, my receiver ([this Sony](http://www.amazon.com/Sony-STRDE575-Dolby-Digital-Receiver/dp/B00005I9R9/ref=cm_cr_pr_pb_t)) doesn't have HDMI inputs so my connections are all a little clunky at the moment.

I'm in the process of researching a receiver upgrade and curious what you guys are using. At first I was thinking an AirPlay receiver would be great, but I think the Apple TV actually makes that unnecessary. But I don't want to have the TV on just to listen to music. I assume you can target the Apple TV as an AirPlay device and control it remotely via iTunes. I'm currently using an Airport Express plugged into my receiver, but I'd like to use the Apple TV's HDMI connection for better quality. The only other device I will have plugged into the receiver is my PS3 for Blu-ray/DVD/games.

I have pretty much every Apple product – a MacBook Air, an iPhone 4S, an iPad 2, an Airport Express, an Airport Extreme with a generic HD hooked up to it as a makeshift Time Capsule, and now an Apple TV. Currently I have all my music stored on my MacBook Air's drive, but I'm wondering if one of the other devices is a better home for the ""central collection."" Where do you store your media?

I'm wondering if any of you have any experience using an iPad in conjunction with an ATV when no wifi access point is available.  While I think they'd be willing to take the ATV and the iPad, adding a router into the mix would be a bridge to far for them.

I've considered the mobile hotspot feature on their Android phones, but I'm not sure if you can configure that for only local access... I'd hate for them to incurring exorbetant data roaming charges when all they really want is to stream their photos/media from their iPad to their TV.

Step 1) Restore AppleTV via iTunes and make sure iTunes is updated. 

Step 2) Once restored, connect to TV/Network, let it boot up once to the main screen.  

Step 3) Disconnect AppleTV from HDTV and connect to computer via  USB cable and power cable. 

Step 4) Run seas0npass, when you get to the point where it asks you to go into DFU mode, press down button and menu button at the same time until white LED light on AppleTV flashes rapidly, then let go of the buttons, wait 8 seconds ... THEN press and hold down the Menu and Play/Pause button for 8 seconds and it should enter into DFU mode.  When it does, UNPLUG THE POWER CABLE!

This works on my wife's snow leopard Macbook, as well as on my WinXP and Win7 machines.  

If it didnt work?  If the cable is bad, then WindowsXP or 7 wont display the AppleTV icon in the device manager and you will need to try another one.  I have maybe 4 of these cables lying around the house and all of them work, so its rare to get a bad cable and if you do have a bad USB cable, you dont need to spend more than 10$ on a new one.

We use ATV2 as a big speaker streamer (don't ask why...) and for now we put pics on it as a screen saver. What we would like to have is some kind of rss news display, maybe with title and short summary? Anything will do.

Is it doable? I saw that aTV flash has something like that but we don't need whole atv, just want rss option.

So, I've been thinking about getting a new toy.

Sounds like I can get an AppleTV, jailbreak it, and put either Plex or XBMC on it and get all my media, plus the added benefit of being able to buy/rent movies from Apple (Would like to try and go a bit more legit). So, first of all, I live in The Netherlands, but I used to live in the states and I still have a US bank account that I keep open primarily for my Apple account. So I have a legit US iTunes account. Will I be able to rent and buy movies from Apple? Or is there some kind of IP block. I know I can't get Netflix to work on my PS3 or anything unless I get a VPN or something which I haven't bothered doing yet. I would imagine that Netflix wouldn't work on AppleTV for me, though, right? But what about Apple? Oh and what about Hulu?

If I buy an AppleTV here in The Netherlands, it's not going to be locked into a NL only iTunes account or anything is it? They don't lock them to specific regions, do they?

How do you watch DVDs? I still have some PAL and NTSC DVDs that I want to watch from time to time. Now, I use my American PS3 for NTSC and my Mini for PAL. will I be able to access my Mini's DVD drive from the ATV? Also, does anyone know if there's a way to be able to freely play both NTSC and PAL DVDs on the Mac without the limit on changing regions?

Also, should I wait a bit to buy one? Are there rumors floating around about when the next one will be released?

I was sort of waiting to jump on the ATV bandwagon until it had sort of gelled a bit better, which it sounds like it has. Is jailbreaking it a hassle? I don't have a problem with the technical side of actually doing it, but I've never jailbroken my iPhone because I didn't want some problem every time software is updated, or just things not working like they're supposed to, unexplained problems, that sort of thing. Anything like that with ATV?

Thanks, r/AppleTV for your help. I'm a huge Mac fan, but I've never really followed much of the AppleTV news, so I'm trying to catch up!

God bless Steve Jobs.

I have tried the latest Seas0npass and the downgrade to 4.4.2 as found on the Firecore forums; both result in the same iTunes error above.


I think it might have something to do with DFU. My ATV2 will not power on at all with just a micro usb connection. I have tried 3 computers and 3 cables with the same issue. I have run iREB with the power cable + micro usb cable in and iREB indicates that the ATV2 is in a pwned DFU state, but I cannot remove the power cable (or the device simply powers off).


This is the procedure I'm using to get into DFU:

1. Plug in USB and Power cable to ATV2, don't turn on power. 
2. Open iReb, Select Apple TV 2
3. Turn on power switch (ATV2 slowly blinks)
4. Hold down Menu + Play/Pause (Faster Blinking)
5. After about 5 or so seconds the blink rate goes much faster (fastest blinking)
6. Release Menu + Play/Pause.
7. ATV2 is detected by Windows/iTunes. iREB succeeds in exploiting the ATV.

Currently I have an Apple TV 1st gen with ATVflash installed I also have a 2nd gen Apple TV with ATVFlash installed.
I currently use SMB file sharing on the 1st gen Apple TV and use the media player on the 2nd gen Apple Tv to stream my files to the 2nd gen.
From my laptop I can drag and drop files to the 1st gen Apple Tv and watch them on the 2nd gen Apple TV.  
This is simple and works effectively.  (The 1st gen operates like a NAS).
What I am toying with is installing a version on Linux to the 1st gen Apple Tv to give me a little more flexibility on the 1st gen, namely a torrent client and use of the USB port for external storage.  Would also require remote desktop access as the 1st gen is not normally plugged into my television.
Having Google'd  this I've come across some different ways of achieving this but the distros I have found with relatively simple installs act as a way to make the 1st gen Apple TV a better media player.
This isn't required I would just like it to be a better NAS.

I'd also rather not have to plug a keyboard into the 1st gen ATV.

Any thoughts/recommendations from the Reddit community?
