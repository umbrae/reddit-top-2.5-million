When I was 15 I was incredibly depressed and struggling with my OCD and anxiety. It got to the point that I decided to kill myself. I arranged everything (Note, when, where, how etc.) and waited. I waited about a week until my parents went out to dinner. I attached a note to my door telling my parents not to come in and to just call the police, got dressed in my nicest clothes, showered, did my hair, and put a suicide note in my shirt pocket. My father had a number of guns and I chose one of them to do the deed with -- a Beretta 92 handgun or something like that. I went into my bedroom, turned on some music and laid down on my bed. I put the barrel into my mouth, sang a few lines of 'Freefallin' through tears and pulled the trigger. 

Then it went into a third person type thing where I was just watching myself. I saw myself laying dead on my bed, slumped over and bleeding everywhere. I watched myself lie in my own gore for what seemed like forever. Then suddenly it felt like all the wind get knocked out of me, and I was back in my body. 

*click*

The gun jammed. I just threw it onto the ground and sobbed into my pillow for hours before cleaning up everything and going to sleep.

I have no idea what happened that day, but I'm more grateful than you can imagine. After that I really made an effort to turn my life around, and it did.

My girlfriend and I had been together about a year at the time, never had big problems, we are both pretty relaxed people. Never have had a big fight, never had trust issues, the whole shenanigan. 

So one day I was out in front of my apartment building smoking a cigarette, this was before we lived together. I had seen her the night before, had a nice dinner, gone out to a bar, then gone to my place, after which she took a taxi home. So as I'm standing out in front of my apartment building, she pulls up in a taxi. I wasn't expecting her, and was pleasantly surprised to see her. I put out my cigarette, smiled and walked up saying something like ""Hey, what are you doing here?"" (in a very friendly way). 

She scours at me, and slaps me square across the jaw. Obviously I'm dumbfounded, and at a loss for words so I just kind of looked at her. She never said anything, just barged past me into the building. 

I followed her up to my apartment, asking her what was happening the whole way, she goes into my apartment, grabs her bag and some of her stuff she left there, throws a few things at me, breaking a glass or two and knocking down a bunch of stuff on a shelf. Shecalls me a pig, says she knows everything, and that I've broken her heart. I'm trying to figure out what's going on obviously, and she stops on her way out when I touch her sleeve, glares at me again and slaps me. She tells me something like ""I hope I never see you again"" and walks out. I followed her to the street and she got in her cab, and drove off. The street was pretty empty, this was maybe 8-9am, and i watch her drive off. At this point I'm just lost for words, scared and sad. 

Then, as I'm watching the cab drive away, someone hugs me around my waist from behind. I turn around, and its her, in running clothes (she was wearing heels and a leather jacket before), and I went completely pale. She said ""hi"" in her usual happy-go-lucky tone, then noticed my look and said ""what's wrong"". 

I spun around, no taxi. It had literally driven away 5 seconds earlier, no way it could've turned in that time, and all the lights were red. I didn't say anything to her, just ran upstairs. Her bag was gone, things were still broken, my door still wide open. So then I told her. 

We were both monumentally confused, there's no way I could have mixed her up with someone else, and she's an only child. We had security check the cameras, and sure enough, Me following a girl to my apartment. The angles weren't great, and the film wasn't great quality, but it was pretty easy to see me and my face, but hers was always hard to make out looked a hell of a lot like her, but never a clear shot. 

No way it was the same girl. 

Still creeps me the fuck out, and we don't talk about it. 

EDIT: Someone in the comments made me realize I should add to the follow up of this: we did file a police report, they came, gathered up all the broken stuff, and found only my fingerprints and my girlfriend's on them, same with my door, and this girl got into my building herself, which means she knew my door code. Her typing it in is on the footage. I just hope I never see her again.

EDIT 2: Brought up in a conversation with /u/ZapActions-dower  I had a conversation with a professor at columbia (family friend) about this situation ""hypothetically"", not wanting to sound the fool. He teaches something like philosophy and other things to do with superstition and explaining the unexplainable. One of his explanations was very close to this. Somehow, a ""mirror"" of our world, running a nearly identical timeline, folded over ours or collided with ours temporarily. Maybe she saw me at the bar the night before with another girl (my girlfriend), not seeing her face, and decided to break up with me the next morning,coming to my apartment. Then the amount of a disturbance that resulted in caused our two worlds to break apart right as she drove away. I'm not really one to believe in those things, but after this, I don't consider anything impossible. Also, that makes me wonder, if that's true, how much did that fuck up this mirror world? Things can't possibly be the same there now, she broke up with me. I don't know. its a lot to think on.

EDIT 3: Thanks everyone for the theories and suggestions! This is the first time my girlfriend and I have gone into thinking about this in a while, and this is the first time we've been able to think about it without being really shaken and scared. It's sort of fun actually. Keep it coming! I'm trying to make sure I get back to everyone, unless you post something that's already been said so be sure to read! its been awesome so far! If i fall asleep i'll get back to you in the morning. Thanks again!

About 4 or 5 years ago I worked at a Little Caesars Pizza. Usually I would work inside on the pizzas but we had just started up this Monday Madness deal where pizzas were only $4 on Monday so we needed someone to advertise. I was a wild and weird metalhead so [I took up the position](http://youtu.be/V06uUmjbmgo) on Mondays of just going out there, throwing around a sign to get attention, and bring people in for pizza. Not exactly glamorous but I had fun.

One day while I was out there doing my thing I see a van coming straight at me. It jumps the curb and slams in to me and I feel it crush me against the electrical box controlling the street lights. I see a quick flash as the traffic lights flick off then black out.

I gasp and I'm still on the corner and nothing has happened. No van or anything. Well, I was a little shaken up so I decide to pack it up and walk back to the store for a break. I walk no more than 15 feet away from the corner when I hear a crash. I look back and a van just hopped the curb in to the electrical box and I watch the traffic lights flick off.

I've been reading the stories on this subreddit and have enjoyed them, so I thought I would share my own weird story with you guys.
It happened in early 2000 when I was working at a juvenile detention center in a small town in Oklahoma as a corrections officer. I was working nights at the time and went to work at nine p.m.

This one night when I arrived for work my supervisor looked confused and asked me what I was doing there. I said ""I work tonight."". And he said ""But they said you called in a few hours ago saying that you were sick."". I was a bit confused and said ""It must have been someone else and they got the message wrong."".

After everyone else showed up for work that night it was a bit more weird, but we carried on as usual and assigned everyone their places for the night; I went to work in the control room where I usually work. The control room is the center of the prison that has direct control over the cameras, doors, phones and everything. After I relieved the guard on duty and settled in for the night, I looked at the message that said I called in. It said that I had called at 6:50 and said that I had gotten sick while out cleaning up after the storm. There had been a storm the night before and it was a bit bad, but not anything that I had to go out to clean up. It was truly weird.

The supervisor came into the control about that time. He was also a friend of mine outside work and we started talking about it, and how odd it was. I decided to call my wife at home and tell her about it while he was still sitting there. I picked up the phone and dialed. After two rings a man picked up the phone and with a raspy voice said ""Hello?"". I did not know what to say for a few seconds. I looked at the phone to make sure I dialed the right number, and I had. After a few seconds the person said ""Hello?"" again in the same raspy voice. I said ""Hello. who is this?"". ""This is Taylor who is this?"" the person said. My head started spinning because my name is Taylor also. I said in almost a scream ""Where is Ann?"". He said ""Ann's in bed. Who is this?"". I dropped the phone and told my supervisor to ring me out, I had to get home, and I took off towards the door. I could hear Dave pick up the phone behind me and say ""Hello?"" followed soon after by ""What the fuck!"" rather loudly.

I ran to my car and drove home faster then what was legal, my mind racing the entire time. I busted through the door and my wife was sitting watching t.v. and was shocked at me being home. I asked her who was there and she said no one has been here. After a rather long talk with my wife, I went to call the prison to tell them what was going on, but the phone was dead.

I went back to work and when I came in Dave was acting weird and asked me ""How the hell are you doing this?"". He told me that when I left, he picked up the phone and the person on the other end sounded like me. He kinda freaked out and hung up the phone. A minute later as he could see my car leaving the parking lot, I had called back from home and asked what the fuck was going on. He said that I was a bit irate and said I was sick and did not feel like playing these games and was telling him to stop prank calling me and hung up. After convincing him I had no idea what was going on we went back to work.

Later, I find out that the phone line for my area had been knocked down the night before by the storm.

I drove it until I crashed it - nothing serious but it had front end damage that I started to fix with some spare panels scrounged from wreckers. I never got it back on the road, but a friend of a friend wanted to buy it to build a nice streeter so I sold it to him. We loaded it onto a trailer from my parents' property 20km out of town where it'd been sitting since I crashed it, and he drove off with it in about '96. I saw him driving around for a few years after that and the guy gradually built it into a decent ride. I never knew him well but I'd say hi from time to time and we'd talk about the car. He said he owed me a cruise in it after it was finished but we never caught up after then and I didn't see anything of him from maybe 2002 onwards. I always regretted selling that car, and they're hard to find now.

in 2010 my parents made moves to sell up and move into town, and told me I'd better come and get my red car if I wanted it. I didn't know what they were referring to, only red car I ever owned was that coupe, but next trip out there I went to where mum said it was, and it was there sitting up to its axles in dirt just over a rise from one of the old less used gates into the property. It had the same odd colour replacement panels on it and same half-arsed repair job I'd tried in the early 90s. Same car I'd sold to the guy and he'd restored, but there it was in its unrestored state.

Mum and dad insist the coupe had always been there, but I'd used that entry at least a dozen times to get to some storage sheds on the lower corner of the property since I remember selling it and it's just not possible to miss it where it was in 2010.

Our roads and traffic authority verify the numbers and it's definitely my coupe and was never registered after I 'sold' it and there's no record of a change of ownership.

I can't explain that one unless somehow I forgot I owned something I really really wanted and misremembered selling it and seeing it around town after.

I was taught to shake hands and say ""Hi, I'm myname. What is yours?"" This was a rule that could not be broken. One night when I was 7-8, I had a bad dream about being old. I went out to the living room to talk to my Dad who always used to play with legos with me when I had a bad dream.

This time, we got the legos out but there was a man in a chair. I went to introduce my self, and to my surprise my dad shooed me away, got out my legos and proceed to talk to the man instead of play with me. The man and my farther talk for sometime about things I don't understand and neither say a word to me. It was weird, but I was young and the legos were fun and eventually I forgot the whole thing and went to bed. Never thought about it again.

Fast forward 12 years.

I head to bed one night after having a beer or two with some friends and immediately start, from what I can tell, lucid dreaming. (I've never had a dream this vivid since or before) In the dream, I am sitting in a chair talking to my dad about what I have done with my life. He is happier than usual and very interested. In the distance I hear a young person calling for him. He gets up, walks out of the room, and returns a minute later with me as a child and box of legos. Young me approaches me, my dad shoos child me away, young me goes and plays with legos. My dad and I commence talking about the danger of the butterfly effect and how everything could change if we spoke. He insist we wait until young me falls asleep to continue talking about the future. I then have 2 more similar dreams where I see myself from perspectives of mysterious forgotten people and situations. All with my father, all discussing time travel, my future life, and the consequences of changing things.

I woke up absolutely convinced I had time traveled or the ghost of Christmas past decided he wanted to take a off season shift. It took me a week to rationalize it and still gives me the willies just typing it out.

A few years ago (2004), my friend really wanted to see a psychic on her birthday. She's a weirdo and has always been into that stuff. I sort of am too, but I never believed in the power of premonition like she did. 

Anyway, we get to the place (it was in downtown Seattle), and go in for the appointment. The psychic is a palmist and so she sits my friend down and reads her palm. I'm sitting off to the side, listening kind of bemusedly, but not really engaged. After the reading was finished we got up to leave and the palmist suddenly says, ""stop!"" She points at me and says that there's something about my energy and that she'd like to read my palm. 

I declined and said we had somewhere to be (I was taking my friend out to lunch with other friends) and that we didn't have time. The palmist seemed disappointed and said, ""I'll tell you what, I'll do you one better."" She asked for a slice of paper. Not a piece, mind you, but a slice. So my friend tore a corner off some notebook paper. 

The palmist wrote something down on the paper, folded it up, and told me not to open it until the night I knew I'd found the woman I was going to marry. I said whatever and threw it in a drawer in my computer desk at the end of the night.

Fast-forward to 2012. Last year I proposed to a girl and she said yes. We're getting married in the fall, and would have been married sooner, but her mother died just after X-Mas of longtime cancer complications. 

A few nights after the proposal I had dinner with that friend and she said, ""remember the note the palmist left for you?"" I had completely forgotten. So, giggling to ourselves, we went back to my place and met up with my fiance. I opened the drawer, dug around for a while and found the slip of paper. When I unfolded it, all three of our jaws dropped. 

It read: 
""Remember, No Peeking!
Moira S.
11/12/2004""

My fiance's name is Moira S. I still don't know how she did it. A couple weekends later we went back to the palmist and told her the story. She sat there listening with a shit-eating-grin and said that she didn't know at the time what the connection was, but that she kept hearing that name in her head. It was only as we left that she realized ""the message,"" was for me and not for my friend.

My future wife and I sat down for a reading. The palmist said that we would have a long, fruitful marriage. We're going to invite her to our wedding, under the condition that she never makes another prediction for either of us. I also still have that ""slice"" of paper. I figure I'll frame it and tell the story to our kids, should we ever commit to that.

Back-story-time: Me and my then girlfriend(let's call her Audrey) went to see a movie a couple years ago(Transporter 3...?), we both smoked at the time and were collectively out of smokes, so on the way to the theater we went to grab a pack. Because of this we were a bit late to the movie, and never had the chance for a pre-flick cigarette.

Anyway, we saw the movie, and on our way out, a friend(call him Mike) of ours came up and asked if we wanted join him for a smoke. As we walked out of the building Audrey took the plastic off the pack we just bought, took out a smoke for the both of us to share, and tossed the plastic into a trash can. As we stood talking to Mike, a guy came up to us and asked Audrey for a smoke, and she told him we were smoking our last one. This guy didn't take kindly to that, and started shouting about how she's lying and how she has no right to lie to him. We offered him a ""sorry dude"" and tried to walk away. Then things got messy. He grabbed Audrey's wrist and wouldn't let go, and started shouting ""what the fuck"" and such things. Now, I'm not going to let someone harm the person I love, so I stepped between them and grabbed the arm he was using to hold her. Then, before I knew what was happening, I had a horrible pain in my throat and stomach, my coat was getting wet, and Audrey was shouting ""STOP! STOP! STOP!"" I also heard Mike saying ""What the fuck"" and ""Oh my god."" Then, I started feeling what I could only describe as exhaustion, and I no longer had the strength to hold my head up. As my head was dropping, I saw the red all over my coat and the knife the guy was holding. My vision started going black and sounds became muffled. As I felt gravity overcome me, I heard a single sound, coming from all around me, like it was the only thing that had existed. It was Audrey, calling my name for help, just once. The instant after I heard her, it felt as though the universe began to shake, a mid range hum took over my ears, and all the black became a flash of blinding white.

Then I was inside the movie theater, next to Audrey, with Mike apologizing for startling us so badly. We were apparently ""white as ghosts."" He then asked us if we would join him for a smoke, and Audrey quickly declined. We left the theater, without saying a word to each other. I decided to break one of my own rules and asked Audrey for a cigarette when we got in my car. She took them out of her jacket and put the plastic-less pack on the dash in front of me. I began shaking when I opened it and saw a single smoke missing. Audrey let out the most fearful scream I have ever heard in my life when we drove past a guy walking through the parking lot. It was him. She insisted she stay the night at my house.

When we arrived at my place, we turned on all the lights and just cried in each other's arms. I asked her about it the next morning, and she confirmed it wasn't all in my head, but that was the extent to which we ever talked about it. And I'm sure this experience is what led to the end of our relationship, things got too intense between us after this.

A few years ago i was living in a house with some friends. One afternoon 4 people were home: my boyfriend, 2 roommates and myself. The doorbell rang. I heard my roommate answer the door. The exchange i overheard seemed odd, so i went to see who it was. There was a little boy (maybe 4 or 5 years old) standing at the door who seemed to be upset. I'd never seen him before, but just assumed he was a neighbor kid. We didn't really know many of our neighbors, so the fact that we didn't recognize him wasn't alarming. He asked if his mom was there. We told him that she wasn't. He looked really stressed and said he needed to find his mom. We told him we would try to help him out. By now my boyfriend and other roommate also gathered to see what was going on. The boy pushed passed us and just walked into our home. The layout of our house consisted of a living room and a kitchen that you entered into and then their was a hallway leading to 2 bedrooms and a bathroom. One of the bedrooms led to another tiny room (like a sunroom type thing) which had a door leading to the back yard. This door was kept locked with a deadbolt. The kid bolts back into the hallway towards the bedrooms. We are all just in shock that he would just rush into our house like that, so its a few moments before one of my roommates and i follow him back. We check the first room. He's not there. Check the bathroom. Not there. Check the other bedroom and sunroom. Not there. And the back door is still deadbolted, so he couldn't have left. Plus we would have heard it open. We started checking cupboards, closets and under the beds to see if he was hiding. All the windows were closed and too high for him to reach anyway. He couldn't have just run back out the front door either since my other roommate and boyfriend were still in the living room. He. just. disappeared. We still have no idea what happened. Never saw the boy again and never had frantic parents/police officers stopping by about a missing boy lost inside my house.

Also, we were all completely sober. It was an otherwise normal afternoon. And this was a real boy. Not a ghostly apparition of a boy or anything like that.

I was walking through my local mall with my friends, we entered a store and were browsing. The female clerk and I glanced at each other and both did an immediate double take. I walked over and talked with her, neither of us could place where we knew each other from...then it hit me. 4th grade. This was the girl that stabbed me in the nose with a pencil in 4th grade. I told her where I remembered her from and you could see it on her face she immediately remembered stabbing me. She started apologizing and talking about how crazy it was to run into me here. I told her not to sweat it. I was a little bastard back then. 

Then she asked me what I was doing in Oregon. I figured she thought I moved or something considering I don't remember her in any of the other grades before or after 4th. I explained I never left Oregon, or Portland for that matter. This really confused her. 'So you just did 4th grade in Arizona?' She said....Which confused the shit out of me. I told her I've never been to Arizona and did all my schooling in Oregon. 

She then told me she's lived in Arizona her entire life. 
She had just moved here to start college. 

We both remember going to school together and her stabbing me.
Apparently we did it from different states though.

My daughter collects these..,501,71,71,http://www.reddit.com/r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix/comments/14cz79/dont_touch_that_my_daughter_collects_these/,"I just stumbled upon this subreddit a couple days ago and thought this story might belong here. A few years ago me and my brother stopped at a shell station on our way out of town. We went in to the station purchased some drinks and some gas, paid the attendant and went back out to the pump. 

As I started pumping gas out of the corner of my eye I notice this empty water bottle in between two of the pumps. The water bottle is strangely just balancing on the corner of the bottle like [this](http://i.imgur.com/CNSTu.jpg) and is spinning really slowly around the fulcrum. This immediately struck me as odd so I stopped to stare at it and pointed it out to my brother. He said something along the lines of ""woah whats up with that bottle?"" so we both walked up to it to examine it closer.

The bottle was completely empty and as far as I could tell just seemed to be miraculously balancing there like that so I reached down and attempted to push it down onto its side. As soon as I let go it slowly raised back up to the position it was in. ""Weird, wtf!?"" as soon as I said that it seemed as if all hell broke loose around us. Another car in the station started beeping its horn, the gas station attendant started screaming at some guy behind the counter in the station, and at the same time we hear some lady yell ""Hey... Hey don't touch that!"". 

We look up and a woman in her 50's with sunglasses come wandering out of the Shell station garage. ""Hey don't touch that! My daughter collects these."" She said as she walked up to us. She then  grabbed the bottle off the ground turned around and wandered back into the garage without saying another word. 

Before we could say anything she was gone. Once she left the chaos subsided, the car stopped beeping and everything returned to normal. The whole ordeal maybe only lasted 20-30 seconds. We finished pumping the gas, got in the car and drove away. To this day I have no idea what the lady meant by ""my daughter collects these"". It just didn't make any sense. She was very obviously not an employee of the gas station either yet she wandered out of and returned to the garage as if that's just where she was supposed to be. We've often joked that we witnessed a glitch in the matrix and it seemed as if it just spawned the most random person out of the most random spot it could to come take care of it. A few weeks later the gas station was closed down for remodeling.

It had ten stories, and due to its conventional style of architecture, each story was well distinguishable from the outside. 

Anyways, my dad worked on the 6th floor, but when he brought me to work on slow days I would always play on the 5th floor where they had a small model train set in the office. On one particular day I had scraped my knee badly on an unfinished edge of the train set. It was a pretty bad injury as I remember bleeding profusely, but I don't remember the pain much. A bunch of adults offered to help me, but in my distress I refused and rushed into the stairs hallway to get to my dad one floor above. 

This is where everything got weird. 

The stairs were pretty standard. There would be a flight of stairs, a small platform, and another flight of stairs looping backwards leading to the next floor. So when I first flew up the stairs, I immediately realized that the floor I was on was the 7th floor due to the fact that there were no offices (the 7th floor was a dark storage room). Thinking that I probably just missed the 6th in my rush, I walked down a flight, stopped at the small mid-way platform, and walked down another flight. 

It was the 5th floor. The little ""**5**"" that marked each floor was on the wall next to the door, plain for anyone to see. 

At this point I was frustrated but had calmed down. There was simply no way this could happen. I only had to count my steps carefully, and so I did. Step by step I walked down from the 7th floor to the mid-way platform. Standing on the platform, I could turn my head and see the darkened windows of the 7th floor, as well as the little ""**7**"" on the wall. Turning my head the other way, I could then see the ""**5**"" from the 5th floor. This way, ""**7**"", that way, ""**5**."" I didn't even have to move. There was *nothing* in between the two floors except for the little platform I was standing on. 

By now I was sufficiently creeped out to return to the 5th floor and stay put. I stayed there for the rest of the day until a nice woman offered to take me upstairs to my dad. 

This time I was nervous but also a bit curious. Would it happen again now that there are two people? I don't remember much from this point except for one chilling detail. Earlier in my frenzy to find the 6th floor, I failed to realize that my bleeding leg never stopped bleeding, and that droplets of blood had stained the concrete stairs. Now, walking up again, I could see a little trail of dark, brownish red spots leading up the stairs. To my horror, the spots almost immediately disappeared before it could reach the little mid-way platform, as if I had never even step foot there. We kept going and the remaining stairs were pristine, no blood, no trail, nothing. Finally, there it was, right before us, the 6th floor.

Today, I am absolutely convinced that I would have found that little blood trail continuing from nothing again on the stairs to the 7th floor. I never checked though, as I don't think I'll ever go back to that building.

Before I leave a place, or even a room, I do the double-bump butt pat. Phone, keys, wallet. Cool. 

Okay, I'm with some friends a couple years ago, in college, and we're watching a movie. I go to take a sip of beer, and I notice my wallet sitting on the coffee table. Weird. I didn't remember taking it out. I pick it up, look at it and see that all my cards and cash were accounted for. Nothing was out of place. The only out of the ordinary thing was the bulge I could feel in my back-left pocket (I'm a lefty).

So, I put my wallet back on the coffee table and I reach into my back pocket to see what's in there. I couldn't be my wallet, right? Wrong. I pull out my wallet. The same exact wallet that was sitting on the coffee table in front of me. Same cards, same amount of cash. I turn to my friends and I'm like, ""seriously what the fuck is this, why is there a second wallet here, exactly like mine?"" They stare at me strangely, almost worried, and turn back to watch the movie, saying nothing. At this point I'm pretty weirded out, so I stand up to get their full attention, and ask them again, ""why is there an exact copy of my wallet sitting on the coffee table, here?"" They ask me what I'm talking about and they say they don't see anything. I look down and the extra wallet is gone. I just have the one from my back pocket in my hands.

Seriously, what the fuck reddit? I clearly remember seeing both wallets in the same eyeshot, me holding the one from my pocket in my hand, and seeing the one on the coffee table. And I clearly remember checking the contents of both of them, separately.

Did I stumble onto a copy of my wallet, accidentally left by some crew member, and my friends had to play it off like I wasn't starring in my own version of The Truman Show?

He said, ""Dear Lord, I just don't understand what I'm supposed to be doing. I feel so alone. Please, please just let me know that there's someone watching out for me."" 

He arrived at work shortly afterwards. The parking lot was empty. It was rather cold outside, so he wore a coat and gloves.

""It's nice to know that there's someone watching out for you, isn't it?""

I played hockey (surprisingly yes, hockey exists there) and naturally made a bunch of friends doing it. Fast forward 7 years to a few days ago in Canada, where I now live.

My roomate's boyfriend came over and we were talking about setting up a time to get some people together and get a few drinks before he leaves for the summer. I get his number as he's leaving, and once he's out the door, I text him my name to give him my number. He texts back ""hey, is this really Kuuz?"". I figure he's just kidding around and I don't bother responding.

The next morning I was walking downtown with my housemates in a crowd of about 800 people or so (I live in a pretty big city and this was in the middle of downtown during a small street festival) and I bumped into this girl I met once a couple of weeks prior. We exchange the usual niceties and she mentions she's with some friends that apparently know me. I go to meet them and was shocked to see it was an old hockey buddy from the middle east with whom I haven't spoken in almost 7 years and his sister. They had just arrived in Canada recently. This is where it gets weird though. We talk for a bit and do the usual catching up, when he mentions, ""Hey, I actually got a text from you yesterday"". I thought he was kidding until he pulled out his phone and showed me. Turns out it was the exact text exchange between me and what I thought to be my housemates boyfriend from the day before. So in short, by some ridiculous coincidence, I mistyped my buddy's number into my phone and texted who turned out to be an old hockey friend that I hadn't seen or talked to in 7 years who had also just arrived in Canada, then proceeds to bump into him in a huge crowd of people downtown not 12 hours after the initial exchange.

When I was 5 or 6 years old I had a vision: 
My mother and I attended an open house as my parents were hoping to move to a new area of town. My mother and I had been doing this type of thing a lot recently, so I thought nothing of it. We approach the house and ring the doorbell (the house looked kind of dead). A man opens the door; he is about 5’9”, a little bit chubby, wore suspenders and had big clear thick rimmed glasses. I remember him vividly. 


We were the only people in the open house, which in itself made me feel uncomfortable, I couldn’t put my finger on it, but something felt off. The man brings us upstairs and begins showing us a bathroom that connects two bedrooms. We are standing with our backs against one door and he is standing with his back against the other; we are facing each other. Suddenly, he pulls out a handgun and shoots my mother in the face. I feel her blood and brain matter splatter onto me. He then shoots me in the face and everything goes black. 


This wasn’t a dream as I was not asleep, but maybe some kind of premonition? I experienced it with my senses (I could feel, smell, see, taste vividly) which was something that had never happened before. I blew it off because I was a kid with an active imagination. 


The next part is where the glitch happens. About a month or so later my mother takes me to an open house. Lo and behold, guess who opens the door? Yep. That guy.As soon as I saw this man’s face I felt my stomach sink. To this day I still recall this feeling as the most threatened I had ever felt. The man made no indications that he was dangerous, but I knew better. I look around the house recalling every detail with frightening accuracy. Is this really happening?


I told my mom that we needed to leave and that we were in danger. My mother is strong believer in the power of intuition, so I could see the concern on her face, but we decided to continue the tour anyway. No surprise he takes us to the upstairs bathroom; we are standing in our perfect positions. Our impending doom is approaching rapidly and I can feel my body tightening as I prepare for the inevitable impact. He reaches into his pants discretely when suddenly the doorbell rings at the same moment he was supposed to pull out the gun. The look of disappointment on his face was so remarkable that it still gives me chills. He politely said, “Excuse me,” and walked out of the room to greet the other guests. I told my mom what had just happened; she was quite shaken by that and we left immediately. 



I don’t know what I experienced that day.

So, I'm in college, and for Thanksgiving we got Wednesday through Sunday off, so my parents decided to get a hotel and come up to visit me. We did family stuff, went hiking and out to eat, yadda yadda. 

Well, today was their last day here. Checkout was at 11:00 and they wanted me to stop by their room today before they left to say goodbye (the hotel is like a 5 minute walk from my dorm).

So this morning get to the hotel at around 10:45ish. I walk through the lobby and there are people eating the free breakfast. I press the up button for the elevator, it arrives, I get in, press ""5"", and the doors close. 

As soon as the doors close, I get this strange feeling. At first I mistake it for fear and become afraid the elevator is going to drop or something. But then I realize it's this fucking strange feeling that I get sometimes. It happens to me often enough that I've come up with a phrase for it. ""The page has turned"". That's how it feels. 

Imagine that your life is a book. Someone is reading this book, and they get to the end of a page, so they have to pause their reading briefly as they turn the page, then they continue reading. When I get this feeling, that's what it feel's like is happening to me. A page in the book of my life is being turned, and things have to pause momentarily. 

Anyways, I could go on and on about just that, but all you need to know is that this is a familiar feeling to me. 

So I'm in the elevator, going up to the fifth floor, and I get this feeling. Usually it lasts like 5 seconds. But this time it is lingering at the forefront of my mind. 

The elevator gets to the 5th floor, and I still have this feeling. The doors open and nobody is there. It's almost 11:00, checkout time, I was expecting people to be packed up and headed down to the lobby but whatever. 

I start walking to their room (512) and I feel like I am the only person on the whole floor. It is dead quiet. Again, I was expecting people to be moving their luggage and stuff so they could get going, but nothing. 

I get to their door, and I knock. All this time I still have that strange feeling. They don't answer; I knock a couple more times but no still answer. I decide to look through the peephole and see if I can see them moving around. I did this yesterday, and was able to make out a small part of the room. (I thought to do this because I do this at my dorm before I go to unlock my door to see if my roommate is in there before I enter...why? IDK, I just like to know if he's in there before I enter). But when I look through the peephole, it's totally back. Nothing. 

I thought this strange since I could make things out yesterday. At this point I'm getting really paranoid because I still have that strange feeling, and it's never lingered like this before. So I whip out my phone to text my mom and ask where they are, but the area where the signal bars usually are says ""Searching..."", like it does when you are out of service. Now, I get bad reception on my campus, usually 1 or 2 bars, but I don't ever actually lose service. 

So as you can imagine, I'm pretty fucking creeped right now. I run back to the elevator, press the down button to go back to the lobby. The doors immediately open; the elevator hasn't moved, which I again find strange since it's checkout time and these are the only elevators, I figure it would have been called to another floor by now. 

I get in, press 1, the doors close, and *boom*. The feeling is gone. The elevator arrives at the lobby, and as I step off a family is waiting to get on. A man who I assume was the dad says ""Fucking finally,"" as if they had been waiting a long time for it. 

People are still eating breakfast, everything is normal. I pull out my phone (hey look at that it has 2 bars now!) and call my mom to ask where they are. She say's they're still in the motherfucking room.

So, fuck it, I head back to the elevator. This time a lady with a maid cart gets on with me. I press the 5, she presses the 7, doors close. No weird feeling. We go up. I get off at 5. 

Now this time the 5th floor is full of life. There are people waiting with their luggage to get on the elevator, as I had expected the first time. (They didn't get on b/c it was going up to the 7th with the maid lady) Two of the rooms have their doors open with people stacking their luggage outside to leave. 

I get my room 512, and look at my phone. Oh looky there, not searching for service, I have 2 fucking bars, standing in the exact same spot as before. 

I knock on the door, mom answers and lets me in. I'm still kicking myself for not remembering to look through the peephole to see if it was all black or if I could make things out again like the day before. 

So what the fuck happened? Had the fifth floor not ""loaded"" yet for me? What the hell? I'e been thinking about it all day, and honestly I'm still really unsettled.

1362427184.0,331,self.Glitch_in_the_Matrix,19nn8e,Long read but definitely the strangest thing I've ever experienced,393,62,139,http://www.reddit.com/r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix/comments/19nn8e/long_read_but_definitely_the_strangest_thing_ive/,"My best friend found this subreddit. He told me I need to share this story. It’s kind of weird and unbelievable. I have no proof it happened, but if you want to hear a story…gather around.

In the winter of 2009 my brother and I took a road trip from Portland, Oregon to Port St Lucie, Florida and back again.  We made the trip to visit my sister who lives in Port St Lucie. She and her husband just had their first child and my brother and I were excited to see the newborn.  

On the trip to Port St Lucie we took a combination of freeways from the northwest all the way down to the southeast corner (basically a diagonal route), but several times throughout our voyage we were tremendously delayed by snow.  The trip which should have taken no more than three days ended up taking five. Because of this delay, we had to cut short our visit with our sister’s family.

On the trip back to Portland we decided to take I-10 the entire way. This stretch of freeway runs all the way from Florida to Los Angeles and would completely keep us away from the snow. The I-10 route added several hundred miles, but we both needed to be home for work the following Monday, and this was a sure fire way not to be delayed.
 
The first day of the return trip was uneventful, but we did manage to drive 1,300 miles from Port St Lucie to San Antonio before stopping for the night. The plan was to make it all the way to Las Vegas the next night, which would leave us with about a fourteen hour final day drive. The trip was going well. It wasn’t until we left San Antonio that the glitches started happening.

The car we took on this trip was a 2008 Honda Civic Hybrid. The entire trip we had been getting right around 35mpg (this is digitally displayed on the dash), so we had become very aware of how many miles we could squeeze out of a tank.  We knew to refuel around 350 miles, but we also knew we could stretch that number into the low 400’s if need be.
 
About 100 miles outside San Antonio, I notice the fuel gauge was dropping noticeably faster than usual, so I clicked the button to change the dashboard display only to see the car was getting barley 26mpg. At first I was shocked, but I reasoned it to possibly driving uphill the entire way (I still don’t know)? I thought throughout the course of an entire tank of fuel that it would eventually balance itself out and we would finish the tank within that 35mpg range. I was wrong.

I kept a very detailed log of this entire trip, and this one stop in Fort Stockton, Texas is the only anomaly in the entire book. The car which had consistently held around 35mpg suddenly finished an entire tank off at 25.8mpg. That is over 100 mile difference in the vehicles normal range. I still to this day cannot figure out why there was such a drastic shift in fuel consumption in that 300 mile stretch from San Antonio. I’ve reflected on that tank of gas several times since this happened, and I have almost come to the conclusion that it was an intentional glitch in order to make us pullover where we did.

Our original plan was to refuel about 50 miles later in a town that I cannot remember, but we obviously ran short on fuel. Anyway, with our GPS programmed to Las Vegas, Nevada, we headed back onto the road in which the GPS directed. Pretty soon after we got back on the road we realized we were no longer on I-10 heading west, instead we were north on highway 285 (here’s a TIL for some people. Evenly numbered highways and freeways are heading East/West while odds are north/south). We didn’t think much about being off the interstate because many times throughout the drive we had been directed onto bypass highways. We assumed this was just another such instance.

After about an hour and a half of driving on highway 285 we crossed into New Mexico, which was about two hours earlier than we should have crossed the border. By this time we realized the GPS thought this was a more efficient way to go to Vegas even though by all accounts it is about an hour faster if we had stayed on the 10. We were annoyed, but decided to just stick it out with the GPS and keep heading north through New Mexico.  

Nearly five hours after refueling in Fort Stockton, my brother and I were hungry and decided it was time to find somewhere to eat. Driving through this part New Mexico is kind of lonely. There are very few towns, and where there are towns, they are small and on the verge of becoming ghosts. I think their economies are built around helping travelers fill up their gas tanks. Other than that, I cannot see a reason for them to exist.

My brother and I have talked about what happened next so many times, but we still cannot figure it all out. We passed through a small town with a couple gas stations and we know the town was named Vaughn, NM, and then about 20 miles later we drove through a town call Encino, NM which did not have a gas station (that we can recall). In fact, the second town didn’t really seem to have much there if anything. I wasn’t sure if anyone was living there. I seem to remember questioning why it existed in the first place, but then quickly dismissing it and driving right through.

Not even ten miles after passing through Encino, NM, we surprisingly came upon a city/town that wasn’t loaded in the GPS. This wasn’t a big deal, because I was using a cheap handheld that lost its signal all the time, but usually the only things it didn’t display were newly built roads and recent construction areas. This city was definitely not brand new, so I figured the GPS was being buggy. The oddest part of finding this city, neither of us remembers seeing any warning we were coming up on a town of this size. It had several fast food joints, restaurants, hotels, motels, grocery store (Albertsons maybe) and even some bars. If I were to guess, I would say this city was roughly 10-20k people. 

We decided to pull off and grab a bite to eat. Normally we probably would have grabbed some fast food, but my brother saw a Ruby Tuesday’s and really wanted to try it out. There were a couple Ruby Tuesday’s around the Portland area at the time, but neither of us had been there. We had just heard they had a pretty good salad bar, and I guess my brother was in the mood for something other than fast food.  I went along with the suggestion because I was sick of eating junk.

((((((for the rest of this story, I will be N and my brother will be G)))))


We pulled into the Ruby Tuesday’s parking lot, got out of the car and walked in the restaurant. Immediately upon entering a waitress who was milling around the hostess station says, ‘Oh my word, is that N and G?’ Both my brother and I answered that it was indeed us, and the waitress went on to ask how life was in Portland. Suddenly it clicked, this girl knows who we are, but we are over 1,000 miles from home. Did we know her from back home?

My brother and I both gave very basic vague answers to her question, and I could tell she was kind of unsettled that my brother and I were being evasive. When we were seated, my brother immediately asked me where we knew her from, which was the same question I was going to ask him. I told him that I had no idea who she was, and that she obviously had mistaken us with some other people.  Not more than a minute later this guy bartender comes up and says, “No fucking way, G and N. You back for jobs?”

What? My brother went on to tell the guy they had us mistaken with some other people.  He laughed and dismissed my brother’s response as a joke. The bartender continued on seamlessly and started asking us how we fared in the three month anatomy and physiology course we had taken at Oregon State.

I remember thinking all of the sudden; this is not a coincidence anymore. My brother and I had taken a three month 15 credit A&amp;P class at Portland State University when we were in our early 20’s (We were late 20’s when this interaction happened). Finally, I asked the guy exactly where they knew us from, and he just kind of paused and started looking me over. Then he said, “Oh damn, you guys just look really similar to some people that used to work here.” 

He apologized and claimed he had to get back to work. After a bit, our food came and my brother and I noticed they had switched out our waitresses from the girl who recognized us when we walked in. That wasn’t a big deal, although a bit strange. Next a guy who I can only guess was the manager starts walking over to our table with a big smile on his face. As he gets within about ten feet of us he kind of starts looking over my head and stops. I think someone behind me was directing him not to talk to us. After he received the message he sharply turned 90 degrees and walked away without saying a word.

This had quickly become the most awkward meal of our lives.  It went from people acting like it was a celebration for us to have shown up to everyone avoiding eye contact with us at all cost. After we finished up with our meals the waitress came told us the cash registers were frozen and that our meal was on the house. 

I really wanted to ask the waitress what the name of the city was that we were in, but I also really wanted to get out of there. After leaving the restaurant we were running pretty low on gas, so I decided to refuel before we got back on the highway. I assumed the name of the city would be printed on the receipt. We were not that lucky.

This city strip was a one way road on the eastern side of the highway. When we left Ruby Tuesday’s the only way to turn was right, and it headed straight back to northbound 285. In order to refuel I would have to head north on the one way street and turn right on a side street to head back to the southern part of town to the gas station. The only available right hand turn off that one way street was closed so I was forced back onto the highway without fueling up. About 20 minutes later we found a truck stop at the intersection of 285 and I-40 where we finally filled up. 

The rest of the trip was very ordinary. We talked at length about how weird that Ruby Tuesday’s was in the middle of New Mexico. We came up with solutions about how we had doppelgangers with the same names. We joked about how people that look similar follow the exact same paths in life regardless of their upbringing. We talked ourselves into it being a major coincidence. When we finally got back to Portland we decided to do a little research and find out the name of this town.
 
Here is the google maps picture of that stretch of highway. 

http://i.imgur.com/sY3NB89.jpg

We know we refueled at a truck stop at the intersection of 285 and I-40, which means that we had to have passed through Vaughn and Encino, so there should be a city between the truck stop and Encino. I don’t see anywhere on the regular map or the satellite map where this little city could possibly be. 
We have never really been able to answer what happened that day. I can still vividly remember the waitress’s face of unease by the way my brother and I were behaving, the bartenders’ voice change when he figured out we were not the people he thought we were, and thinking the manager looked identical to the actor Ken Moreno. My brother and I know this stuff happened, but we have never been able to find the solution.

Maybe some redditors can give me an answer or maybe this was just a glitch. Maybe someone has driven that stretch of road and knows the town. 

tl;dr apparently my brother and I worked at a Ruby Tuesday's in the middle of New Mexico

This was the summer that I consider my ""awakening from reality."" We all saw some really weird shit, and we still don't like to talk about it much, but here's the strangest. So friend 1, let's call him Josh, was living on some property in a little camper, and friend 2, Brandon, and I were staying the night with him. It was already pretty late, around 2 or 3 am, and we were just sitting around watching a movie. At some point, Brandon gets up and says he has to piss and gets out of the camper, no big deal. About 30 minutes pass and I look at Josh and ask him about Brandon. He totally forgot, and didn't realize it had been so long. We decide to get up and go check outside to make sure he isn't just hanging out by himself. As soon as I stepped out of that trailer onto the ground, I got this feeling of absolute dread. I didn't want to be out there. I felt like I was no longer safe at home on this planet. Josh insisted that I help him look, but I just couldn't do it. I went back inside, and waited for Josh to come back. I kept thinking about that feeling I had, and I was still terrified. About 15 minutes passed and Josh poked his head in and said, ""scandinor, you need to go to bed. Right now. Go lay down in that bed, close your eyes, and fall asleep."" The sincerity of the way he said it made me do exactly as he said. The next morning I had to bug Josh nearly all day to tell me what happened. Apparently when he was looking outside and calling out for Brandon, he had the exact same feeling of terror, but he stuck through it and kept looking. He couldn't find him. He looked everywhere, and he was nowhere to be found. What made it worse was that he was hearing sounds that he couldn't even describe. He told me he's never been more scared of anything in his life. He gave up about 30 or 40 minutes later, and came back to the trailer, but he stayed up to wait for Brandon. Around 5 in the morning, Josh started hearing noises, so he went outside again. He was hearing Brandon's voice, but he couldn't find him. His voice was coming from several different directions. Josh described it as Brandon's voice, but intensely anguished, crying, and repeating over and over, ""I'm so sorry Josh."" Josh returned to the trailer, terrified. He told me he felt that that would be the night that all three of us would die. 6 o'clock, and Brandon comes stumbling back to the trailer, babbling incoherently, and naked. To this day he won't even bring it up or acknowledge the topic. Josh told me that when he first came back to the trailer he was saying things like ""who am I?"", ""am I back?"" ""what did they do to us?"" I still don't know what to think about it, but none of us have been the same since, especially Brandon. Josh and I are constantly seeing things that aren't(?) there, and occasionally get the same feelings of absolute terror. Never in my life have I felt so completely lost and separate from everything that I can distinguish as ""reality.""",,False,,t5_2tcwa,False,,,True,t3_143hg3,http://www.reddit.com/r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix/comments/143hg3/lost_in_between_spaces/,

This happened about half an hour ago, at home.

I was sat on the sofa on my laptop, bored. My mum got back from asda and the first thing she said when she came in was ""who were you on the phone to?"" I replied ""nobody, why?"" She said ""I tried ringing you, I was gonna get you a mcdonalds."" I went to look for it, and couldn't find it anywhere, so I called it from the house phone. It said it was busy or something, I can't remember now. Confused, I carried on looking for it. Thought maybe it was out of battery or I'd accidentally not put down the phone from the last call. 5 minutes later, I found it on my bed under a pile of clothes. The screen was lit, my phone was in the middle of a call. I have an iphone, so the screen was like this: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:IPhone_call_screen.png 

At the top, it said 'Michael'. I panicked really badly because that's my ex boyfriend, who I ended on bad terms with about a month ago. I could not understand what had happened, I thought I must have accidentally called him and then put my phone down and left it there? I don't know. It said the call had been going on for 43 minutes. Then I remembered that I don't have any credit or minutes on my phone, so he must have called me and I answered by accident. But I couldn't understand why he would have let the call go on for 43 minutes when I wasn't there. All this thinking took place within about two or three seconds. I put the phone a little closer to my face to check it said 43 minutes, and I heard something. A sniff. And then another one, like somebody was crying. I put the phone to my ear and heard another sniff, and then the fucking creepiest thing in the world happened. I heard my *own voice*. I, future me, alternate me, whatever it was, said: ""Sorry, you can get off if you want to."" It was MY voice, mine. But I wasn't saying it, I was just hearing it on the phone. It sounded like I had a cold or I'd been crying. It was quite hoarse, but it was definitely my voice. Then I heard Mike, my ex boyfriend, reply. ""I don't mind. Are you sure you don't want me to come round? I'm not doing anything."" I was so confused and shocked, I couldn't say anything, I just kept on listening. I heard my voice again: ""No, it's ok. I look a right mess and I would only bring you down."" If I was 99% sure before, I was 100% sure then. 

Michael: I don't mind, seriously.

Other me (I can’t remember my exact words, but this is roughly right): No, I have a lot to do anyway. The funeral is supposed to be next Wednesday and there's still loads of things that need doing. I have no idea what I'm doing, and Sarah's just not in the right frame of mind to do it. I thought she was feeling better after yesterday but she picked up some of her stuff today, her purse and that. She had an organ donor card in it, but I don't think she'd have been able to donate, you know because it was cancer? 

Michael: Yeah.

Other me: So Sarah got really upset about that. 


By this point, my heart was beating like crazy. I KNEW that it was ME, having a conversation with my ex boyfriend, mentioning my sister (sarah) yet I was listening to it. I couldn't listen any longer, I was too confused. The other me started speaking again, and so did I. I didn't hear what she said, but I said 'hello?' The conversation went absolutely silent. Then Michael said 'what?' I panicked, and in my panic, I ended the call. I took a few seconds to calm down and breathe, and then I checked my call history. For less than a second, it disappeared so quickly that I’m doubting myself remembering it, it said my last call was with Michael. It showed that for less than a second, then it disappeared and my last call was from the day before to my mum.  So many things about that conversation freak me out. Mainly:

1)	Michael is my ex boyfriend, who I am certainly not on good terms with. My entire family could die and he wouldn’t give a shit right now, he hates me with a passion. I was talking to him like we were together. 
2)	It sounded like I was talking about my grandma, possibly? I know she’s got an organ donor card, and she’s currently in remission from cancer. But why were me and my sister planning her funeral rather than my mum?

Both lead to me think that I was hearing an alternate me, or a me in the future. A me who got back together with Michael, a me who’s grandma’s cancer returned. That happened about half an hour ago. I spent 10 minutes searching my phone settings and stuff to see if that could help, and then I’ve just been going through the whole thing in my head. I don’t know what to do. I’m scared. I’m scared of what just happened, and I’m scared to ring Michael and see if he knows anything. I didn’t want to forget any of the conversation so I typed it up pretty fast afterwards. So many things are going through my head right now. What the fuck just happened?

Tl;dr I heard myself and my ex boyfriend having a conversation over the phone about a funeral and my sister.

i'm from germany so my english isn't the best (be patient grammar nazis).

my story (i'll make it short):

i was walking through the [corridor](http://en.frog2dragon.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/090903-expansiel-corridor.jpg) (not really my corridor...i don't have pictures of it so i'll take one out of the internet that looks similar) of the apartment building wehere i lived 6 years ago (i was 15 and on my way home).
 

 
as soon as i was at the 3rd door on the right, two guys where breaking THROUGH THE FUCKING DOOR (they've beaten each other) and threw me on the ground (they didn't see me so i don't blame them). my head was bleeding and my hands were shaking. then, suddenly, i were standing at the spot where i stand just 5 fucking seconds ago. first thing i did: check my head...NO BLOOD...NOTHING. 


now comes the part that still fucks my mind: i stared at the 3rd door on the right, hoping that something happens.(my body was shaking...i can't descibe that feeling...it wasn't fear..it was something different...) 

!!!BAM!!! two fucking guys, beating each other where breaking through the door.

i just stand there, shaking and sweating, don't knowing what i just have witnessed. 

the one guy threw the other one back in the room and i RAN to my door. at home, i just wanted to be alone.
  
  
 
  
it is 6 years later and i'm still afraid of corridors.

i don't know what happened back then (it was some kind of ""time travel"" but only in my mind. the problem is that it felt so real...the pain, the feeling of the warm blood, the smell of the floor. EVERYTHING.)

so yeah...this is my ""glitch in the matrix"" story. hope you like it.

When I was a kid we would drive up there to do some fishing and shooting, but also to collect a specific type of rock that when cut in half and polished would resemble a scenic picture of the view of mountains from within a cave. I do not recall the true name of these stones, we just called them picture rocks. My fathers friend and neighbor owned an art gallery/mineral shop that used to be a church. If you have ever driven through Start-up on your way from Sultan to Goldbar on highway 2 you might remember seeing the robot sculpture outside the shop that my dad built. This is the place that we sold the stone for $2 a pound. It was lucrative revenue for a pre-teen.

The walk from the creek where we harvested these rocks to the dirt road wasn't particularly long, but lengthy enough that you could presumably get lost while en route if one didn't know where to go. In the years we spent at this creek I had only ever seen two other people out there. One was a game warden that heard the gunshots from our target practicing session and tracked us down to make sure everything was fine. The other is the subject of my curiosity.

When I was about 14 I distinctly remember hauling a backpack full of these rocks up from the creek to my dads truck. Along the way I ran into a man that looked to be about 30 years old. We both appeared to be surprised that we would run into anyone in this rather remote section of the mountains, but as I got closer to this man (he was heading down to the creek, I was heading up to the road) he seemed to grow increasingly more startled, as if he was seeing a ghost. He didn't say anything as I passed, he just stared at me seemingly trying figure out the appropriate words ask me something. After passing him I remember thinking how much this guy looked like he could be in my family, the similarities were striking. I continued on to the truck, dumped my load of rock off at the truck and headed back down to the river to my dad. When I arrived I told him about the encounter and asked him if he had seen this man to which he replied that he hadn't. I have remembered this encounter quite vividly since then.

Last year I was visiting my family in Snohomish and decided to head up to old Goblin Creek for nostalgic purposes. It had been about 15 years since I was last up there. Along the way up there I found out that the Index-Galeema road had apparently washed out years before, luckily I knew of another way up there via Jack Pass. I found the dirt road and parked where my dad used to park and proceeded to walk through the woods down to the creek. Along the way I saw something that absolutely shook me to the core. As I was about half way through the woods I was startled to see someone else coming up from the creek, a boy, about 14 years old. He was wearing a backpack that looked to be burdened by heavy weights. As we got closer, I began to get increasingly confused and shocked as the boy looked exactly like I did at his age. I meant to say something to him as he passed, but could not figure out the right words to express what I was thinking at the moment. He passed me and kept going. I walked a little ways and finally stopped when it all really hit me. I remembered the encounter from my teenage years and realized I had just lived the other half of the experience! Both the man and boy were me, roughly 15 years removed! I turned around to catch up to the boy in the thick Western Washington woods. I ran all the way back up to the road where my truck was to find...... nothing. There wasn't anywhere else besides the road for him to go to, and I hadn't stalled so long as to not be able to catch up to him. He was simply gone. Curiosity got the best of me so I hurried down to the creek half expecting to find my dad fishing on the bank 15 years younger but found nobody.

I ended up going home and deciding that this experience was too unbelievable to tell even my friends and family. I just wanted to get this out there to the wonderful Reddit community to see what others think and hopefully to see if anyone else has had this type of experience as well.

About 10 years ago, my husband was at work and I was at home with a fever. I get high fevers pretty regularly and usually don't try to reduce them unless they get *really* high, as I have pretty good luck beating whatever I catch with the fever heat. I was feeling pretty normal, just a bit warm, not out of it or anything.

My husband called from work to tell me he was going to leave in about 5 minutes. He told me the time of the train he planned to catch.

It was a really nice cool evening, and I wanted to get some fresh air. I had decided to walk to the station to meet him there. It was about 5 minutes from work to the station, 5 minutes wait for a train, 10 minutes on the train, and then a 15 minute walk to our place. If I left right away, I would get to the station with time to spare and could surprise him. I was ready to go and just waiting for his call to head out, so left right after hanging up the phone. 

I didn't want to risk missing him if he'd left right away and caught an earlier train, so I focused and walked quickly toward the station.

Next thing I know, I am in front of his workplace. I have a wtf moment as I stop and look up, followed by panic that I somehow zoned out and came all the way here, missing him entirely... And then he comes out. He is also thoroughly freaked out because he just called me at home a couple minutes before. Only about five minutes had passed.

Even stranger, I didn't use my train pass. To this day, I have absolutely no idea how I got there. To walk would have taken an hour. ",,False,,t5_2tcwa,False,,,True,t3_16ynya,http://www.reddit.com/r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix/comments/16ynya/meeting_my_husband_at_the_station/,

We
got a few hours of riding in before the
weather changed from sunny to overcast ridiculously quickly. 

We decided to take shelter so 
the coming rain wouldn't wreck our boards. We found a nearby 
gas station and went in to get some snacks. Instead of eating inside, we went outside
under the awning. 

While we were eating, I explained to him what ""Operation Troll the NSA""
is all about. He thought it was hilarious and wanted to do it with me. I dialed his
number as I went to throw our trash away. It took a little bit of searching to find a
dumpster because for some reason, the gas station had no trash cans outside. This gave
us plenty of time to ""troll the NSA"" before I got back. 

After a few seconds, he picked 
up the phone and I began saying a bunch of dumb terrorist buzz words (pressure cooker bomb,
Allahu ackbar, second 9/11). For as funny as he thought the idea was, he wasn't really
getting into it. He responded like he was really bored, answering back with things like 
""yup"", and ""okay"". 

I headed back under the awning, and when I was about 30ft away from
him I said something along the lines of ""allah be with you"", and I hung up. Strangely
though, he didn't hang up. He had his phone to his face and was laughing and joking around.
This weirded me out, but I just hopped on my board and rode a few circles around him. 


After about a minute he hung up, looked up at me, and asked me if I wanted to do the troll
the NSA thing now. This freaked me out pretty badly. I tried to explain that we had just done
it when I was throwing my trash away. He's a pretty strong believer in paranormal type
shit, so he immediately wanted to check our phones. Mine listed a two minute call
between us from 7:08-7:10pm, and his phone listed a call about 3 and half minutes, to 
another friend (Amber). Both of the calls began at the exact same time.

it off as my crappy phone fucking up. That's because I never told him I could hear him talking

About 5 years later in real life, I moved to a new place where I ended up going on a few dates with a co-worker. She had a brother who jokingly said if I hurt his sister he would kill me. She turned out to be a real piece of work and the relationship didn't last. A couple weeks after we broke up, I got a knock on my apartment door in the middle of the night. When I asked who it was, I received no response, but they just kept knocking and trying to turn the doorknob which was locked. I realized that the scene I had dreamed about matched the surroundings of where I was living at the time. Finally, the person stopped knocking and left. Through the blinds, I could see them walking past the headlights outside in the parking lot. No return visit, but I moved away shortly thereafter as a result.

I'm sure this will get lost among the other posts, but I have never had the courage to tell anyone other than my closest friends.

This was around 7-8 years ago (13 or so). My brother and I shared a bedroom with 2 twin beds with blue sailboat sheets. Walls are a light blue and there is a TV next to a computer on the opposite wall from the beds ( Just painting the scene ). My brother goes to spend the night at a friends and I am sleeping alone in our room for the first time (I would generally sleep in my parents room, but knew I was getting too old for it) After getting past my fear of being alone in the dark, I finally turn off the TV and go to sleep. I got to sleep surprisingly quickly, but was woken up when my TV kicked on to a channel with static. I don't know the time, but estimate it at around 2-3 AM. I get up and am a bit startled, but I begin to realize something. The computer chair (made up of old, beaten up plastic and fake leather) is slowly spinning. Enough to be noticeable, but not to be making rapid rotations. This is the part that still makes me look over my shoulder every night before turning out the light to make the horrifying journey to my bed. As I stare at the chair, with the static TV channel giving off that particular frequency that drives you nuts, I see an arm sitting on the armrest. As the chair turn a small girl is sitting there. The best I can describe her is straight out of The Ring. Keep in mind this was years before it was released. The girl did nothing but sit, knees curled up to chest, staring, looking, silently waiting. As the chair continued its rotation the feeling of dread dissipates and the TV clicks off. At this point I freak the fuck out. I start screaming for my dad. My parents were across the house and didn't hear me. I sat there for 4 hours waiting to die that night. I remember the battle inside my head. ""Get under the covers and hide!"" , "" ""What, so it's easier for her to approach you?"" It was maddening.

Interestingly enough, I befriended a girl who I found out long into our friendship was a Wiccan. After I told her this story, She said, "" Don't be afraid. I have seen that spirit in your house. She only wants to help you."" I must admit I felt better after that, but still..... mother of god.

No one said a word to me or acknowledged that I was even there. My mum started getting really freaked out and then I realised why. She was quite heavily pregnant with me in the photo.

I obviously freaked out and told him I hadn't been in the basement. He told me he had seen me there for several minutes. He said he had tried to say hello, but I had seemed distant and distracted.

I called my best friend, and she confirmed that I had been with her the entire night. I was not drunk/drugged, I drank nothing all night but a water bottle that I brought with me.

It was going slow, so I passed him. He followed me all the way to the airport until we went to separate terminals. 

Fast forward to a few months* ago. I was flying out at 7:05 to Florida via KCI for Thanksgiving (my parents had retired). Driving along, I noticed almost nobody on the road with me. A few minutes later some asshole behind me turns on his brights. I look in the mirror and think ""what a piece of shit car!"" Then I shat bricks. That was my fucking car, busted bumper and all, from like 1999-2002 (don't remember what year the original flight was). So how did that car manage to stay alive since I sold it?**OH SHIT, HOLD ON!** I noticed the fucking Rasta license plate. It's cool, Rasta stuff is pretty popular. Now, after reading several GITM posts, I was starting to think maybe something is off here. I looked out my window just in time to see him passing me. We drove to the airport. Seperate terminals.

If it comes out nonsensically, I apologize. I've never put it down like this.


This happened four years ago when I was starting a nonprofit program straight out of University. The orientation for this nonprofit lasted a few weeks and was a whirlwind of new people. During one such orientation, I met a fellow---a stranger of course; everyone was a stranger---from a country I've never been to. Nothing special. It was a group setting and we were participating in a group activity. Met other people, went on to other activities, the day came to a close and I went home.  



This is the strange part. That night I'm taking a shower and recounting the day, as one will do in the shower. But when my mind comes to this fellow, it's as if time just slowed right down. I don't know how to describe this; I've never felt anything like it before or since. It was like who I was and who I will be and everything in between was one thing in that very moment----but my mind was strangely fixated on that stranger and **I knew** I knew him as a close friend. I knew his life and his stories. I knew his personality and I knew the feeling of our friendship.



Then everything went back to normal and I realized the water was cold as I'd been in the shower so long the water heater had run its course. It takes it a good half hour to do that. I just can't make sense of it.



But this is where it gets stranger still. I still wonder if I'm mistaken somehow. If I dreamt that moment in the shower, because it just seems so strange. You see, I AM now very good friends with this person. And everything I saw in the shower is true. I saw it. I don't know what to make of it. I keep saying that, but. Fuck. I just don't know.



I've never told him about it because it sounds admittedly crazy. I've never shown any hint of my knowing before he let me in on a part of his life.

My wife and I were visiting my parents, and one morning, I was in the little guest house kitchen making coffee, and she was in the shower. All of a sudden she starts cursing, and comes out nearly in tears. Her wedding band had apparently slipped off her finger and disappeared in the shower. 


She goes into the bedroom to get dressed, still cursing. But I had a good idea what might have happened. In fact, I went into the bathroom absolutely certain I'd find that ring.


I had lived in that guest house in college, and the shower was small and old with a grate over the drain. But there was a broken tile beneath the lip of the shower door. For some reason, if I ever dropped a razor cartridge or small bit of soap, the water would jam it into that crack which was almost impossible to see unless you got down on the floor.


I looked in the shower and checked the crack. Sure enough, her ring was stuck in it. I pried it out and popped it in my pocket then went to find my wife.


She opened the bedroom door right as I got to it. She told me not to worry, that she had left her ring in the bedroom, and had never taken it into the shower. She showed me the ring on her finger.

Confused, I reached into my pocket, and there was nothing there.


It's not really a big deal, but it has been something that stuck with me. I remember how the ring caught on the rough edge of the tile as I dug it out with my finger nail, and I remember looking it over to see if it had gotten gouged since it was 14k gold and somewhat soft. So when there was nothing in my pocket, I got worried that maybe I had some sort of episode.


I spent about an hour looking around the little house to see if I had dropped whatever I found. I never found anything.


It's is the first time I've ever told anyone.

1359874768.0,215,self.Glitch_in_the_Matrix,17sq10,Many years ago I drove by a mirror image of myself. To this day I cannot explain what I saw...,259,44,43,http://www.reddit.com/r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix/comments/17sq10/many_years_ago_i_drove_by_a_mirror_image_of/,"I was headed North out of town on a street that ends in a ""T"" intersection with another street that hugs the biggest cemetery in town. The street I'm on has a stop sign, the other does not, like most ""T"" intersected streets do. The street that hugs the cemetery is a curvy one but the street I'm on begins the residential area of town and is laid out in an evenly spaced grid pattern. 

As I sat there looking both ways before I turn right I notice that another Chevy Chevette (the make and model of the car I'm driving) is headed my way from the right. It's even the same color. I look left to make sure there's no oncoming traffic before I turn right, and as I look right the other Chevy Chevette is at the intersection turning left onto the street I'm on. So we're both OK to turn.

I glance at the driver as I start my turn and first notice that his mouth is hanging open in awe/shock. Odd. Then I notice that he's too is wearing glasses, he too is wearing a white t-shirt, he too has a red beard and balding hair then *BAM*: it hits me that he looks exactly like me! 

My foot falls off the accelerator as he passes by my, slowing down, and my mouth too drops open in awe/shock. The streets are two lane streets so he's not more than 10 feet from me during this turn. He passes by me slowly and it's fucking me in every respect. Same shape of eyebrow, cut of beard, balding hair pattern, pudgy overweight face, style of glasses, make and model and color of car. *Exactly* like me as now we both have this awe/shocked expression on our faces. There's this *connection* that passes between us as he's seeing himself in me, as I'm seeing myself in him.

But by this time I'm rolling out into the intersection! I grab a hold of what little composure I have left and complete the turn right, numbed. How. The. Fuck? I drive not more than 15 yards and then, checking traffic, pull a u-turn. It's a small street so it's a three point turn. I drive, quickly, back to the intersection and turn left onto the street I just turned off from. I'd say not more than three minutes has passed. If that!

When I turn back onto the street there's no sign of this other vehicle. I continue down the street, looking at the side streets left and right. I go ten blocks down this street, all the while looking left and right at the side streets to see where he might have turned off, but there's no sign of him. None! All the blocks are on straight, flat streets so it's not like he could have turned onto a side street then around a corner, or in a dip in the street, and disappeared out of sight. He's simply not there, not any where, to be found.

I finally pull over, by the local post office, as my brain is on overload. I keep replaying that event over and over in my mind's eye and...that was me I just passed! Every conceivable point of comparison (as described) matched. Fucking MATCHED! Even down to the blue faded tint of the glasses I (we?) were wearing.

For decades I've wondered what the hell transpired that day. For years I've been a redditor, but not until a few weeks ago did I know of a subreddit such as this one: A Glitch In The Matrix. I will go to my grave, with 100% certainty, that I passed by myself, in my home town, on a warm summer day. The recognition that passed between both of us when we were but 10 feet apart from each other cannot be erased from my memory.

Multiple witnesses.,265,52,62,http://www.reddit.com/r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix/comments/17lp85/hit_by_a_garbage_truck_went_through_me_multiple/,"In 1996, while working on Jackson Rd. in Sacramento CA. for the California Conservation Corps, I was a crew leader with 6 employees picking up trash along the roads. It's a 2 lane road, and leads directly to the dump, which means lots of garbage trucks.

Our truck was parked along the side of the road. We were told not to walk around the front of the truck because you might get hit.

I did just that.

I walked around the front of the truck, and I heard someone call me. When I looked over, one of my co-workers was standing on one leg and shielding himself. I walked back to see what happened, and 2 of my most religious co-workers dropped to their knees, crossed themselves and proclaimed it was a miracle.  When I reached the other employee, he could not believe I was alive, and I quote his words,:

""I SAW it hit you.""

We discussed the issue for about 1/2 an hour and I got spooky looks from the Christian employees. 

EDIT: spelling

Details: This was in January 1996, executing a contract that convict crews wouldn't take because of the danger.

My immediate Supervisor was Tommie L. Watts, a C-1 at Sacramento' CCC Satellite. That information was relayed to him, and I believe he may have been a witness.

I'm open to researching and finding the witnesses and help is appreciated.. I have a few friends from CCC on FB, but were not witnesses. I'll see if they remember the story or know how to get in touch with fomer co-workers who did witness the event..

EDITEDIT: Didn't think it'd get much attn, so I will say the full truth. This was not the first time, and happens when I am in danger I am not aware of. This was the 2nd incident with a car. The 1st happened while Jay-walking in downtown Sacramento. I'm Out for tonight, I've put out messages on FB asking if anyone remembers 'an incident' back then, but not listing the details so I can get corroborating evidence without corrupting the witness.

The plan was to drink beer, eat food and play board games and Guitar Hero. A nice weekend, indeed. 

We get there in the early afternoon, around 16:00, and start settling inn. Some are outside bringing in wood and tending to the fireplace, some are making the beds ready and some are cleaning the living-room or shoveling snow on the porch. In other words, we weren't all in the same room at the same time for the first hour or two.

At around 19:00, we settle down for dinner. There was taco on the menu, so it was a collective effort to make it ready with people cutting up vegetables, cooking the meat and setting the table. Because we all had a few beers during the time at the cabin, people were constantly going to the outhouse. This meant that the first time we're all together in the same room for a good period of time was during dinner. 

When we ate, the mood was good and we were all chatty. Talking about what we were going to play afterwards and just generally getting to know each other. Because we were so many, we had to use some chairs from the kitchen area and eat in the living room. There was a couch with room for three people, one with room for two, a chair plus two chairs from the kitchen. The seating arrangements made it possible for seven people to sit comfortably, without anyone having to use the middle seat in the three-seater. 

After the feast of cheese, meat and salsa we were all sitting around the table chatting and playing a board game. Suddenly, my colleague asked ""Hey, where is...uh... Who sat there?"" pointing at the empty living room chair. ""Oh, that was....uh... I'm not sure."" one of the guys said. ""It was that guy from... uh."" My colleague answered.

We all swore that there were seven of us on the trip, but we couldn't remember who the last person was. There wasn't a dinner plate for that seating, and it didn't look like anyone had been there. We started to count who came here in what car, and the number we came up with added up to six. At the same time, we had brought in the two chairs from the kitchen because there wasn't room enough in the living room, and we had said no to some people wanting to go on the trip because the cabin only had seven beds. 

We were quite sure that there were seven of us, but there was no evidence of us being more than six people. There was no seventh plate, seventh backpack or anything. Still, we had bought enough food for seven people, had made seven beds and were damn sure that someone had been sitting in the empty seat. We had no recollection of this person, but all agreed it was a man, not a woman.

This happened during spring in the far north of Norway, and if it wasn't for the longer hours of daylight and how close the cabin was to our city, we would have been totally freaked out. 

I still have no idea of who the seventh person should be, but I still find it odd that all of us were sure of there being a seventh person - a man - on this trip. I guess he went out of the matrix, and the matrix adjusted itself.

**TL:DR** Six people was staying in a cabin, but we swore we were seven when we came.

Since I was 7 or 8 I've had the same digital radio alarm clock. It had a brown case and green numbers. The board in the back looked like this: 

    88:88:

The dots that make up the colon on the far right would light up individually to indicate am or pm.

About 8-9 years ago I was have a restless sleep, and I thought I was dreaming about waking up and looking at my alarm clock and seeing the numbers all messed up. And in my dream I took my phone which was also on my bedside table, and I took a picture of it because it was so weird, then went back to sleep.

The next morning I woke up and forgot about the whole thing. A few weeks later I was looking through the photos on my phone and saw this:

http://i.imgur.com/l52q2.jpg

Those were the numbers on my clock I saw in my dream. A few weeks later the clock died and I kept it in a box that my mom threw out, to my dismay, during a spring clean.

Every once in a while I think about it. It is impossible for those numbers to show up on the board that the clock used. And I knew that clock really well. I'd had it for years. I listen to the radio on it. I drew it once for school. I took it apart once to see what was causing a rattle inside. It is impossible for the numbers to show up as 27277.

I swear to you all this photo has not been Photoshopped in anyway. It came right off my phone (which was a Razr, I think.)

Just a note: I use a lot of description which may seem unnecessary, but it's for a reason.

Two weeks before Christmas I realized I needed gifts for quite a few family members and friends and drove out of town to go to a mall where no one would recognize me (I live in a small town). The food court was packed so I went to this McDonald's that was across the parking lot. 

I ordered my usual (I'm a chicken nugget junkie) and went and sat down in a seat that was facing the drive-thru but also gave me a clear view of the front counter and register. There were, of course, big picture windows that let me see everything going on outside.

I was sort of spacing out and playing around on my phone when I looked up and saw an employee, a young black guy, run out behind the counter with a bag of food in his hand and run out the side door and flag down a car that had driven out of the drive-thru without their food, a black/dark-blue SUV. The driver rolled down the window and the employee handed the food through. He started to walk away when suddenly he turned as if the driver had called to him, and then he waved and smiled and the car pulled away. He then came back inside and went back behind the counter. 

I then noticed a few things happening in quick succession: a little Asian girl in a big pink overcoat was walking to her table when she stumbled and dropped her chocolate milkshake all over the ground. A woman with red hair in a blue hoodie grabbed her young son's arm and scolded him for running around, and pulled him back to the table where the grandmother was sitting. A large, older white man with a really scraggly beard took his food back to his table and his wife grabbed the fries.

I looked down to put my phone in my pocket and looked up, and I saw the same employee from before running outside with a bag of food. I distinctly remember thinking ""Huh, again? People are stupid."" but then I noticed the car was the same, and just like before, the employee turned to walk away before being briefly called back and then waving the car away.

I started to think that maybe the car had come through the drive-thru twice when I noticed those same things happening:

*little Asian girl dropped her milkshake
*redhead scolded her son and pulled him back to the table
*big dude gets his order and sits down with his wife

Things just seemed to move in the same patterns, but those were the main events my brain focused on.

It couldn't have been more than 30 seconds, but it was incredibly surreal. I've had de ja vu before, but this was different because I was totally aware that what was happening had happened already. Maybe it was all in my head, but I don't know. If anyone could offer an explanation I'd be glad to hear it, it was unnerving.

As I was walking up the street, I saw a good friend of mine. I know it was her, for a few reasons. She currently has a distinct winter coat bought in Korea, I've never seen another like it. Similarly, she carries a handmade bag bought from Etsy, with her initial R on it. Her hair was how she usually wears it. I knew she must have been walking to where her fiancé normally picks her up, and as we passed each other, she had just answered the phone, her voice entirely and absolutely familiar to me.

Because we were walking in opposite directions, she had just gotten on the phone, and I was keen to catch my bus home, I made the split second decision not to call out and say hello to her. I wish I had. 

Instead, I straight away took my own phone out, and sent her a quick text ""Totally just saw you on William Street!"" A minute later, I received her reply: ""Haha like an hour ago?"" Confused I texted back, ""A minute ago?! You're walking to the bridge!""

The next text I received from her deeply unsettled me. She replied ""I'm at home!?"" Thinking she was kidding me, I described her outfit to her ""Korea jacket, Etsy bag, ballerina bun. You answered the phone and said 'I had to call you.'""

I worked at an amusement park that had a water park in it when I was 18. This happened while I worked there, and for a few weeks was all anybody talked about.

There were several of those tall tube slides that are about 4 ft in diameter at the water park. The ride in question had two slides from one platform, and a family showed up who had a kid who was JUST tall enough to ride. So one parent takes the slide down, then they send the kid down, (with the second parent still up top).

Apparently, lifeguard up top doesn't see the kid come out the bottom and the lifeguard at the bottom didn't wave an all clear, but he sends down the second parent. Next thing you know two parents are arguing. Another employee intercedes, and it turns out that the first parent says the kid never came out the bottom.

Some supervisor arrives and they hold the entire slide, asking employees and the parents if they were sure the kid didn't come out, sure he took the one slide and not the other, etc. Everyone is a bit puzzled because if the kid was stuck in the slide, the second parent would have gone past him.

They end up having employees ride both slides down ""looking"" for the kid--or his wedged in the slide corpse. Both slides are clear. He's just gone.

Security and management is called in, and they call the kid in as a ""missing child"" just in case he somehow got off the slide without anyone noticing and just wandered off.

Then someone radios in that they found a kid matching that description across the whole park, in the non water park section.

Now, this place was strict that if you crossed from the waterpark to the amusement park, you couldn't be wearing swim clothes, and had to wear shoes. But apparently the kid was found barefoot in swim trunks.

Now, the rest I heard different stories about. I heard he was bone dry when they found him. Some people say that he was really disoriented and barely able to walk and not able to talk. I heard different versions of where he was found. Most people claimed he was just outside one of the rollercoasters (which is creepy enough because that is REALLY far away from the waterslides) but other people say he was actually BEHIND that coaster in an employee only locked off area.

A bunch of people claimed they had a friend of a friend who saw the security footage of the kid entering the slide and just not coming out. It grew to legend status over the summer.

I worked in the amusement park section, and can only vouch for this much: over the walkie talkies there was a call from the waterpark for a missing child, and it was quickly answered from someone finding the kid near the coaster. But I heard bits and pieces from people who were in the water park in one way or another that all creepily matched up.

TL;DR: Kid somehow is teleported in water slide.

I figure maybe someone here would know what happened to me, so I'll repost my reply to the original thread:

When I was around 13 my mom made me go to a church camp with a group from our church. She went too, as a youth leader. This camp was about 4 hours away from where I lived. Even at that age, I really wasn't into the whole religion thing, so I spent as much time as I could wandering off into the woods surrounding the camp to curb my depression and angst. I didn't usually wander too far in because I knew nothing about the area, but they had a path stretching far into the woods.. it passed various treehouses, catwalks, ziplines, etc. so even if I went deep in, I could find my way back. It's important to note we couldn't have cellphones at the camp either, at least, not the kids there. This was almost a decade ago, before smartphones were in everyone's pockets anyway.
The day before we left, I decided to walk as far as I could in.. and the path ended at a river. I followed the river upstream, and I encountered a cliff face that the water was running off of. I figured I'd find out where the cliff face ended, if I could in a reasonable amount of time, and then turn back. I followed it to my left, and after about 5 minutes I ran into a clearing and a small wire fence with a wooden gate. On the other side of the gate, I saw the town where I lived. I didn't believe it at first, but I was without a doubt my hometown from an angle that I had never viewed it from before. I nearly shit my pants, because I know for a fact we had driven down a freeway for at least two hours, so we were CLEARLY farther than this away. In my terror, I sprinted back to camp (which I heavily regret now, instead of walking past the gate.. wasn't really thinking, can you blame me?) and told a few friends I had made, and my mom, what I had just saw. I lead them into the forest, same path, went upstream, hit the cliff face, went to my left.. the cliff face ended into a gently sloping hill after about ten minutes of walking. No fence, no clearing.. nothing. I'm generally a pretty stoic person, so my mom genuinely believed me in what I had seen.. but no one could really explain it.
A few years later, I was telling my friend about this and so we offroaded out to where I had seen our town from the gate. Of course, no gate, no forest.. just desert. However, I looked up the camp in relation to where my town is, and it's nearly a straight shot from where I estimate I had this experience (over several mountain ranges).

I'm going to ask my mom in the morning where, specifically, the camp was so I can get a google map view of where I saw from and to.

Edit:  Here's the place, my town, and then where they are respectively.  The drive time is about 4 hours.

Well, yesterday, some kinda weird/coincidental/glitchy shit happened to me that TOTALLY reminded me of the Matrix.

So yesterday was the second day of classes at my college, and I had a class that went until 10pm (sucks). At about 9:50 we got out, and i walked from the class building to my car. On my walk, I noticed a little white baby bunny hopping along with me, almost following me, in the brush adjacent to the parking lot.

Cute, I thought, and continued to my car. I got it, started it, and let it warm up. It was like 5 degrees outside. Sucked major ass. Anywhoo, I put it in drive and began to drive through the lumpy, broken parking lot. The lot doesnt allow you to see very well, cars are parked so closely together because of the nearby apartment complex and proximity to the university. So I am driving down the major lane of the lot, and had to come to a screeching halt. The little white bunny had jumped out in front of my car. I didnt want to smash the little guy. not even 2 seconds later, I see a big truck (not a semi, but a big truck for towing shit) sped across the lane in front of me in reverse. If that rabbit had not stopped me in my tracks, I would have been T-boned by a large truck (I drive a small Mazda 3) going in reverse at a high speed, and then pancaked between it and an apartment building. I was a little startled to say the least. When I looked around, no bunny. He could have easily just hopped away while I wasnt looking, but him disappearing just made the whole thing a little more unreal feeling. So if I never see that bunny again- thanks little dude. When I got home I instantly remembered the whole ""follow the white rabbit"" thing from the first movie. Pretty cool night for me.

About 10 years ago he and my sister had what seemed to be some kind of momentary shared consciousness. 



   My brother and I were sitting on the couch early one morning when we heard my neighbor running up the stairs. After some slamming on my door we got up and went to go see what was wrong. He was out of breath and seemed relieved to see us. He related to us that he had just been having a dream that really shook him. In his dream, he had come over to our house to hang out, play video games with my brother or what have you and when he got up the stairs and knocked no one answered, but he could hear high pitched screaming coming from inside the house. He yelled and yelled for my sister or mother or I or whoever might have been screaming so terribly but no one would answer the door and he was locked out, before he found out what was wrong or could get help, he had awoken. 


  As we stood there a little unnerved but ready to calm him down and tell him it was just a dream, my sister from upstairs opened her bedroom door where she had been asleep and rushed down the stairs. She demanded that he tell her every detail. After he told her everything she looked like she was going to throw up. Evidently, moments before he had began knocking on the door she had been having her own dream. She dreamed that she had awoken and walked into our parents room where she had found our mother and father dead and covered in blood in their bed. She said she had screamed and screamed but that she was too frozen to answer the door.....that she had heard him banging on and couldn't get words out to answer his frantic calls. 


  Still gives me goosebumps.

I saw myself dying from a car bomb when I was a kid.,222,29,37,http://www.reddit.com/r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix/comments/1fjhxx/i_too_had_a_resetcheckpoint_i_saw_myself_dying/,"I saw the [post by stargeetar](http://www.reddit.com/r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix/comments/1fhywg/a_checkpoint_in_life_universe_missed_resetting/), and I have a similar story.

This is a throwaway account, since my real account has a lot of my personal info.

Here's the story, took place when I was 7 or 8, back in the mid 80s. 


I grew in a country that was in the middle of a prolonged civil war. We had the rebels fighting the government troops, neither of who had complete control of the country. The rebels controlled the country side, the government controlled the cities. The rebels would habitually car bomb the city and the government would bomb the country side.



We lived in a very nice neighbourhood in the capital city, and our house was three doors away from a government building (a large-ish house they used as offices). 



One night, I was watching TV with my mom, when all of the sudden, I heard a massive explosion. I see nothing but dust, and the walls disintegrating around me. I looked up and the roof was caving in. Everything was in slow motion, but at the same time it was just a fraction of a second and I didn't have time to react. The entire house was crumbling around me. I heard my mom screaming, then a wall fell on her. I was really freaking out.


Then, out of nowhere, I saw a face in front of me. No body, nothing, just a face. So I looked at him directly in his eyes, while the house was falling around me. I was calm now, and I knew I didn't have to worry.


Then, I blinked. 


There I was watching TV with my mom like nothing had happened. The face disappeared too.


I asked my mom if she felt anything. She said no.


A few hours later, we heard lots of people outside on our street. My dad went out to have a look. Turns out the police found a car bomb infront of the government building close to our house with enough explosives to blow up the entire block. But for some reason, it didn't go off. 


Later we learnt that the rebels had sent a message to the government telling them that the car bomb had exploded, assuming it had all gone to plan. So the police went to check and found the car bomb...unexploded. It didn't go off when it should have.


TL;DR - I saw myself dying as a result of a car bomb. I saw a man's face while this was happening, which stopped me from freaking out. Everything reset back to normal. Real car bomb didn't go off.",,False,,t5_2tcwa,False,,,True,t3_1fjhxx,http://www.reddit.com/r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix/comments/1fjhxx/i_too_had_a_resetcheckpoint_i_saw_myself_dying/,

We were sitting around the camp fire Saturday night just drinking and generally having a good time. We decided to take a walk around one of the hiking trails, and it was dark and beautiful. When we got back to the fire, I had this overwhelming urge to speak about my grandfather. I told them all about him, and it seemed strange, even for me, to just have this urge to do so. 


When I finished,  I felt it, but my friend was the first to say, that it felt like someone was missing. No one was, we were all accounted for, all six of us. But we couldn't shake the feeling that someone wasn't there any more. The night progressed, and people went off to sleep. I decided to watch the fire. I had this overwhelming feeling that my grandfather was going to die, and it made me sad, but more contemplative...I figured ""well yes, we're all going to die eventually..."" 

The next morning after packing up, I felt that I needed to check my cell phone. I had about twenty missed calls, and with out even checking the voice mail, I knew. 

I called my mother, and she had asked me if anyone had called me to tell me, I said 'no'. I just knew. 

This wasn't the first time that this has happened, it happened with other relatives who passed, I've had dreams usually a day before. But this was the first time I was absolutely hyper aware, and so were my friends in some strange way...

I have always had a little thing that I've never told anyone about. I sometimes know something before it happens. It just, pops in my head.

But these are just minor things that I've shrugged off because I had thought they were just coincidences. 

A while ago, there was another moment where I felt this ""ESP"" moment. While my dad was driving with me in the passenger seat, we were about to cross a 4 way intersection in a heavily forested area. The light was green, and we were the only car on the road that we could see. Before we crossed the intersection, a thought popped into my head: ""What if a car doesn't stop at the red light?"". Then, I felt like I was dreaming. I saw a car, an explosion, and then blackness, all in about half a second. I yelled, ""SLOW DOWN!""

My dad looked at me, and when he saw my face, he stepped on the brake peddle, stopping just before the intersection. Just after that, we saw a car fly past the red light at the intersection going from the left to the right. Of course, we were unscathed. 

I realized that I had probably just saved my dad's life, and probably mine. If I had not of said anything, the car zooming past the red light would have probably crashed straight into our car. My dad looked at me wide eyed, but he never said anything about it to anyone. Neither did I. 

Does anyone have an explanation? Why would I suddenly jump forward into the future by 5 seconds, die, and go back 5 seconds?

As I was looking at the house I suddenly had the extremely vivid image of myself continuing to drive through the intersection about a half of a mile away and seeing a car running a red light and slamming into me and then it was just nothing. What was weird for me at the time is that when I came out of the thought, I looked out the window and saw that I was just then passing the house that had originally caught my eye. I had been driving the entire time at about 30-40 miles per hour and the image lasted for a couple of seconds. I was so confused at the time as to how I could possibly still be there that I slowed down significantly and studied the house just make sure that it was the same one, which it was.

It happened a little over 2 months ago (3/20 according to the timestamp in the photo).

A couple of friends and I decided to play tennis, since it wasn't too cold. Since it was pretty late in the day, the courts were empty and one friend and I did what we usually do and scour for some spare tennis balls and use them if there were any good ones. This time, there wasn't any so we decided open up a new can.

My friend uses pink Wilson tennis balls so that if the courts do happen to be full we can easily keep track of which ones are ours. These particular tennis ball cans had 3 balls per can. We start volleying and just hitting around since we both haven't played in a while and we were waiting on a possible one or two other friends to get there. Some time passes and only one of those extra people happens to show up so we decide to play some Canadian doubles. Since there are only 3 useable balls, we decided to each hold onto and keep track of one tennis ball each.

Now here's where it got weird. After playing for a bit, maybe like half an hour, each one of us had a tennis ball in our pocket and somehow we start playing with an *extra* ball! It's weird and none of us could explain it. The BRAND NEW can only came with three tennis balls and somehow we now have *four* pink **Wilson hope 1** tennis balls. For those of you who don't play tennis, the number on the ball is random and only used to distinguish them from the ones on the court next to you and now we have four of the exact same kind.

Is there a rational explanation? Possibly. We just found it perplexing how in a set of empty tennis courts in which we purposefully checked to see that there were no extra tennis balls, we somehow wound up with an extra one of the same unique kind that none of us were able to explain how it got there, other than that it was a glitch in the Matrix.

They said be there around 7 PM.  It was early November and starting to get dark pretty early so when I left my apartment at 6:30 the sun was already down.  It was ridiculously windy that day, but not storming or particularly overcast, just lots of big gusts of wind.  I'm driving to their house about 20 minutes away and going down a normally pretty high traffic, but residential road about 4 blocks from my destination and there's one car behind me.  I'm coming up to a light and all of a sudden the wind just dies and then there are sparks everywhere.  Bright white sparks outside of all of my windows.  No noise, no sound at all.  (I don't often listen to music or the radio when I'm driving and wasn't this night either).  It lasted maybe a couple of seconds, but I had no idea what was going on.  I slam on the brakes and the one car behind me swerves around me, honks and speeds off.  I pull over to the side of the road and get out to look at my car... nothing wrong with it at all.  I don't see a power line down or anything; there's no thunder or lightning and it doesn't look cloudy, but it's really dark at this point.  The weirdest thing is that the air felt and tasted ionized or metallic and had that smell that new electronics have when you take them out of the box.  I'm a little shaken, but not hurt and no damage to the vehicle, so a few moments later I get back in and continue to drive to my friends house.  I look at the clock on my car and it says 6:58, so I should be right on time.  I get there and ring the doorbell and my friend answers after a few minutes in sweats and a t-shirt.  He looks at me and goes, ""What are you doing?"", followed immediately by, ""Where the fuck have you been?"".  I answered, ""Um... are we not doing dinner and video games?"" to which he responds, ""Yeah, dude, like a couple of hours ago... We called your cell and house phone a couple of times and you didn't answer, so we figured you weren't coming and I was just getting ready for bed.""  I look at him incredulously and ask, ""What? You said 7 right?"" thinking it was odd for him to be going to bed so early.  He just looks at me and goes, ""Dude, it's 10 o' clock.""  I didn't believe him until he showed me his watch and then had to look on his microwave and sure enough, it said a little after 10 on both.  I look at my cell phone and it says the same, 10:04.  He could see I was shaken up by this and told me to come in and sit down.  Asked if I'd been drinking or was taking anything.  I wasn't and hadn't.  I sit there for a minute and tell him what happened then think ""Wait"", and ask him to come out to my car.  I show him my car's clock which still reads 7:15 at this point.  He thinks I'm just an idiot that doesn't know how to set my car clock, but I just have no explanation for the missing three hours.  I'm sure I left my house at 6:30.

Yesterday was a though day, but I shouldn’t have written such a personal experience – and certainly not used my loved once names.

If anyone reading this experience parallel life memories: 

There are ways you can cope with it the memories and distinguish them from the once you have physically experienced, and the once you have not, and ultimately try to lead a normal life. 

Some days will be worse than others. 

The commonalities between the memories I can distinguish as his and my own are those that are out of context. I remember them because they have an emotional meaning to the other me, at least that’s what I think. When I remember them I try to put them in context to my real memories and they fall short -- I then know they’re not mine; *the memory of my good friend and I stealing apples from his neighbor’s tree and almost getting caught*. You’ll fell you know the person very well, but the memories with them will only be events which triggered a strong emotion and not mundane things like exercising, talking, taking a walk, etc. E.g. there will be gaps and inconsistencies.

When it comes to your family, this is impossible. I don’t initiate conversation where we reminisce about our childhood anymore. The safes way to talk about this is by letting them initiate the subject and following up when you recognize which of the experiences are truly yours.

When your paths diverges dramatically: Love, family. This will be hard -- and is also why I think deep emotional experiences and memories play a key role in this: There are so many of them; yours first *everything*, trips, arguments, sorrow. 

Children. You’ll remember everything and the emotions will be as real as your own. 

I cope with it by treating them as intrusive thoughts. I go to a place to be alone, usually for an hour, and just think about them.

I won’t insult myself anymore by writing it of as an imagination. That thought is ludicrous placed in context with all that has happened in my life. 

Seek a professional to talk to when it gets too hard.

My friends neighbor had a very old black lab, named Jack, that had arthritis throughout his entire body. Jack moved very slowly, we had never seen him run or heard him bark.

One day my friend and I, we were about 10, were playing by the large tree and Jacks shows up and is just hanging out with us. Out of nowhere Jack jumps up off the ground and starts jumping back and forth barking like crazy. My friend and I stopped playing and just looked at each other bewildered.

After about 15 seconds of Jack going crazy we decide to walk over to him to see what is going on. Not 5 seconds after walking over to him a huge tree branch snaps off of the tree, it was about 12 inches in diameter, and comes slamming down on the ground exactly where we were just standing.

The second the branch lands, Jack sits down and stops barking. We couldn't believe it. We immediately ran inside and told his parents about Jack running, jumping and barking and they didn't believe us until we showed them the tree branch on the ground.

Okay the start of this happened a while ago but I didn't care enough to post about it because it didn't weird me out until recently. I can't remember when in the winter it took place but I remember what happened.

I had been playing the first temple run for iPhone while pooping and there was a fork coming up. I was set on making a right turn, about as set as you can be while making split second decisions. Well at the fork, my brain, my thumb, my arm, myself were all completely set on making that right, but when I get there, I went left instead. Like for some reason, faster than possible for changing my mind, I decided to go left. It was that fast.

When this happened, a spark went through me. Like not super fast electric static spark, like a slow-moving wall of sparky stuff crossed me. I didn't think much of it because it was invisible and I just assumed a chill ran through me or something. 

I think this is where I might have jumped because from here on things were different and straight up reversed in other instances.

In all situations I played it off as ""okay my mistake"" because I didn't feel like being awkward in person.

Immediately out the door I notice there's no bleach stain on the carpet outside the bathroom. Cool.

I get back downstairs and my parents are slightly more irritable with me specifically, I figured something just happened. Except that they're still irritable with me and i have no idea why.

I had been told all the way up till that day that black people swing left. Specific people and I had had that conversation multiple times. The next time it had come up, without implying that they had heard otherwise or changed their mind, they told me black people swing right. I played it off  but that was weird.

The weather in Ohio had never been this god damn turbulent ever. The joke ""it's Ohio"" had always stood, but it had never been like this. It was sunny way late into winter, then randomly super snowy. The snow persisted and would randomly completely melt then come back in full mass. The snow persisted far too long into spring with this kind of behavior. It's summer now and just two days ago it was hardly above 40 degrees, windy, and cloudy. Ohio was never like this. It was sunny almost year round but cold for a few weeks in winter with a decent amount of snow.

There used to be specific trees in my backyard that I played on as a kid and relaxed by when I wanted quiet and peace during the summer. They don't exist. Not like people tore it down in thirty minutes and replaced it with perfectly even grass. It doesn't exist anymore. It was apparently cut down ages ago.

My first instrument in band was clarinet. Everybody in my grade knew I played the god damn clarinet. I played it up to seventh grade before I started learning a ton of other instruments. In conversation no one knew I played clarinet.

I was best friends with this one girl. After this temple run poop event, she gradually became more and more distant with me. We've completely cut contact now, and while it hurts like a mofo I can't help but wonder if it's linked to this?

Occasionally the same feeling of a moving wall of sparky spark comes back, but not nearly as intense as that first time. Every time it happens, I either go back in time a second, skip up a moment, get a premonition and know something will happen before it happens, etc.

I used to hate squirrels, they used to chuck their fruit and nuts at me every time I sat by my tree, but that was a characteristic I had learned to love having in that setting. Suddenly they're docile and even sit next to me.

I've seen wolves here in Ohio, they never lived here before.

The air is different. It was never so heavy.

I used to play louder than everyone in band on my trombone-I attribute this to the sudden increase in ""weight"" of air to me, but now I have to work a bit harder to even be noticeable in bulk band session. (The difference here is that everyone else also recalls me being the loudest-which makes me wonder if I switched with another ""me"" in this universe)

I have tons more examples. I'm confused, but as illogical as it sounds, I honestly think I switched universes while playing temple run and pooping.

**TL:DR-PRETTY CERTAIN I'M NOT FROM HERE**

Edit: A ton of you told me to see a doctor/neurologist, so I consulted my mother who is a psychologist as a first step. Here is what she said-I didn't understand some parts but I hope I don't butcher any messages.

It is important to say that there was a month and a half-long period of time a few months ago where insomnia symptoms spiked and I was going days, near weeks without a second of sleep. During this time hallucinations were not common, but very apparent.

In general she said that it is likely that I haven't recovered as much as I had thought from the wicked insomnia, and that several subconscious problems have occurred that are in the process of fixing themselves. The reason she and I predict that they are fixing themselves is because these differences haven't ever escalated and since I have more or less become used to the present, traumas seem to be going down.

If heavy insomnia had been the cause of this ""new reality"" to me, it is likely that subconsciously I have edited certain memories, forgotten certain elements to this world, and substituted other things. For example, I might have been aware of bleach spilling on the carpet near my bathroom, but we may have washed it out or something so that there was no stain. It is also possible that I had been super attached to the trees that were cut down as a kid, and after editing memories I could apparently ""remember"" sitting under my favorite trees recently. Apparently wolves always lived here. She says it is possible that everyone else forgot I played clarinet since I switched early and only play it at home. I had mentioned a difference in video games to someone else in the comments, I could have forgotten that things could be done. 

It isn't certain why the air felt heavy to me until I acclimatized. That is still iffy and weird.

The loss of my best friend could actually be my fault. Since I had been heavily disoriented, she could have been weirded out and decided to distance herself. I don't exactly agree with this, I feel like there was something else.

My parents being more irritable with me is also a weird one. It could be that I remember my kid years as being easier than now because I wasn't stressed with other things like AP classes and social shit going on around the time.

Black people swinging right instead of left was fucking awkward to talk about. She says I could have honestly misplaced words and switched directions.

Then going back to being general, she decided that I could have dreamed about some of this as well, reinforcing the newly forged memories my brain came up with. It could be a possibility because I have dreamed about this as there were times in the beginning where I was incredibly distraught (I mean, a different universe? What happened to everyone I know? Who are these people?). 

She decided that seeing a neurologist shouldn't be necessary since this didn't affect my productivity, social skills, focus in school, etc, and since it was fixing itself as well I should be good. It'll be watched to make sure I don't lapse or something.

In conclusion: If I really didn't switch universes, then the brain is powerful as hell. If I did, then I am proof that multiple universes exist.

My grandmother and I went shopping, just her and I.  We were headed to the mall, but first stopped by a shoe store.  My grandmother has massive orthopedic problems, and had to get specific shoes.  She was fitted for them, and they wrapped her packages up in tissue paper and bagged them.  We ended up going to another store there, and my grandmother made some other purchases for herself.

Getting back to the car, we locked all those packages in the trunk.

After lunch, we went to the main shopping center.  On the way in, I passed by a necklace I liked.  I mentioned to my grandmother that I would like to look at it closer on the way out, if I hadn't spent all my money by then.

After shopping, I had a few bags worth of clothes, and we stopped on the way out to look at the necklace.  I was a little short, but my grandmother bought it for me.  I insisted she keep it and give it to me for my birthday.  The clerk put it in a nice gift box for us, and I tucked it inside one of the shopping bags.

When I got back to the car, I put my shopping bags in the backseat.  My grandmother drove me back to my parents' home.  When we got there, she pointed out that everything in the trunk was her's, and everything in the backseat was mine--except for the necklace, which she was taking back to gift wrap.  I took the bags inside, and started looking around for the necklace, finding the box.  

I handed it to my mom, who opened the box--it was empty.  We started looking all around the shopping bags, figuring it had fallen out there, and through the backseat.  No luck.  Plus the little wire that was to hold it in place in the box was missing.

I was upset, but there wasn't much to do.

My grandmother called me at home later.  She had gotten home she had opened her shoes, and found the necklace tucked in the toe of the shoes.  

For it to have gotten there, it would have had to get into the trunk, into the bag, through the undisturbed tissue paper, and into the shoe.  We literally had purposefully not opened the trunk after buying the necklace.

Normally i'd say my grandmother replaced it, but the necklace was, as far as I know, one of a kind, and we live in a rural area where the mall is an hour's drive away.  She wouldn't have had time to get a new one before I saw her again.

Cut forward a few years, and I am wearing that necklace, when evidently the clasp falls open.  I walked out of the house wearing it, and later realized I just wasn't.  Two years later, I have just moved into a new house.  I end up finding the necklace in the back of a drawer in the built in vanity, apparently already in the house.

The necklace has actually gone missing again, curious to see where it turns up.",,False,,t5_2tcwa,False,,,True,t3_1eb4rr,http://www.reddit.com/r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix/comments/1eb4rr/the_necklace_and_my_grandmother/,

She had a brain injury caused by a lack of oxygen to her brain (doctors thought she must have taken too many pills, passed out, stopped breathing, and amazingly started breathing again when most people would have just died).  Our relationship was on the rocks because of her addiction and we actually hadn’t spoken in a couple of months.  Still, she’s my mom and I love her, so I immediately drove the hour southeast to the hospital she was at.  She didn’t know the president, the year I was born, or the current year.  She thought it was “1990-something.”  She was very out of it and couldn’t remember anyone she’d met after the 90s.  It was very bizarre-the things she was saying, like that her cat had died years ago (she was alive and well) and that my sister was just a baby and needed to be taken care of (she was 16).  

I should add that prior to her ending up in the hospital, I’d noticed that my period was late.  I took a pregnancy test but it was negative.  Then, while she was in the hospital, I had this incredibly realistic, vivid, and physical dream that I was giving birth.  In the dream, I felt like I was going to black out and I thought I was going to die and I was begging the doctors to make sure they gave my baby to my SO (for some reason I was afraid they wouldn’t and he/she would end up in foster care or something).  When I woke up, I was really shaken up by the dream.  

I visited my mom in the hospital every single day.  One day, out of nowhere, Mom said, “Oh so you’re pregnant.”  I said that no, I wasn’t.  I hadn’t gained a pound or anything so I had no idea where that came from, but I thought it was pretty strange considering my dream and the fact that I was still late.  She insisted that I was pregnant and even started telling the nurses that her daughter was pregnant.  I chalked it up to her brain injury.  Still, it freaked me out enough to take two more pregnancy tests over the course of the next few weeks.  Both were negative.  My mom started freaking me out-she would rub my belly and ask me about the baby.  No matter how many times I told her I wasn’t pregnant, she kept saying that I was and even started to get really agitated and emotional, asking, “Why are you saying that?!” All of the nurses who tended to her daily would congratulate me on being pregnant and I had to break it to them that I wasn’t.

By the time my mom was getting out of the hospital, I was two months late and I was throwing up without a fever or any other symptoms of being sick.  I took one more test, pretty much on a whim, and it came up positive.  When I went to pick my mom up, she had probably about 75% of her brain function back.  I told her she was right, that I was pregnant.  She just said, “Yeah, I know.”  When I asked how she knew, she just said, “I’m your mother.”

Then, my SO and I were originally hoping for a girl, but I could only picture a boy.  No matter how hard I tried to picture a girl, I saw a boy.  Even though I wished for a girl, part of me just knew it was a boy.  Turns out my subconscious was right-he’s a boy (and I’m very happy about that!)   The dream seemed to be some sort of weird foreshadowing too, because I ended up being very ill and needed to be induced a little over 3 weeks early.  The medicine they had me on made it difficult for me to keep my eyes open, and when I did open them, I saw double.  I felt like I was going to black out.  I told my SO that if I died to please be good to our son and to tell him how much I loved him.  After I gave birth, I couldn’t even stand up without vomiting and blacking out because I lost a lot of blood.  It felt exactly like in the dream.

I’m not sure if my mom even remembers this as she says she doesn’t remember much of what happened in the hospital.  Both her knowing and my weird dream still freak me out a bit.

Previously I had thought these were possibly just shorts in her mind but something different happened today.  

The weather has been very windy today and she has been feeling off for a few days.  Quite suddenly she passed out and afterward did not recognize where she was or who I was.  I thought, oh shit here goes another weird thing but several attempts to use previous methods to help her establish reality didn't work, this was the first strange thing.  She started talking about something called The Fire.  I was able to keep her conscious and talking for about 20 minutes trying desperately to gather more information.  We currently live in Texas, when I mentioned that was where she was she said Texas was gone, it burned up.  I told her it's 2013, she said that was so long ago.  She said that she has moved with her family away from Texas a few years after 2013 because it got bad there, it got dangerous.  She said we moved to a place she called ""The Tall Trees"".  I suggested California, she said that's gone now.  I suggested Washington State, she said that sounds familiar but not.  I said Canada, she said yes, I remember that word.  We went to Canada.  I asked if the kids came with her to Canada and she said we traveled together but they were gone now.  That there were no children, that everything was ash.  She said that there was fighting and scavenging to survive before The Fire.  Then there was a bright white flash and everything was red.  Everything burned.  I called in our son to show her that the kids were okay but she couldn't see him.  He sat on the bed next to her and touched her face and she couldn't see him.  She at no point ever recognized me.

We were grouped together for a project and we started talking about our family and life, and that's when we discovered something very very strange... 
My family and I lived in a small tight knit cul-de-sac from when I was born until I was 8 years old. We knew all our neighbours or were at least on first name terms. Everyone but Sarah's family apparently. Sarah's family lived directly opposite our family, but neither of us recall seeing a house opposite our respective homes. She could remember everyone on that street, the kids we played with and all the houses on the street except mine. And I was the same, I did not remember her or her house at all. Also, we went to the same kindergarten and same school. We were even born in the same hospital on the same day. Her father worked in the same company as my father. None of us ever saw each other. I asked my parents if they remembered Sarah's family and they said they have never met or seen them. Same with Sarah's family, they do not remember us.

 My father eventually got a new job and we moved from the city to a small town about 4 hours away. And who else moved there in the same year? Sarah's family. We were in the same classes for several years, again we lived in the same street - up until that project we had never seen or met one another. We had 3 mutual friends and none of them had discussed either of us to each other, this was an entire highschool school of 500 people, quite small. It wasn't a case of ""ships passing in the night"". I had NEVER seen her. 
Her mother had kept her class photos from when she was 5 years old, I was in that class BUT the photo they ended up getting was very smudged (this was way before digital photos and prints), half of the people were unrecognizable in that photo - of course the half that I was on. When I asked my mother if she kept my class photo she said she never received them, it wasn't a big deal but she remembers receiving an empty envelope from the school but no photos inside. She never got around to chasing it up. Probably just a really shitty print company? Who knows.

This could all be coincidence, but I felt like there was some looooong ass glitch in the matrix and that we physically could not see each other for several years but leading almost identical lives, after being born within MINUTES of each other. To this day I still wonder about it.

I remembered hearing it the first time in a dream which is pretty vague now, but there was a person in white who told me that was my real name. It's a made-up sounding name I've never heard before, so it would be impossible for anyone to guess without my saying it. That was about eleven years ago, and as I said, no one knows but me.

About six months ago, a couple friends and I were having a party and we were all a bit drunk. One friend, who often suggests oddball things like this at the tail end of parties, suggest we do a free-writing experiment. The goal is to give someone a bit of paper and a pen, tell them to empty their mind and just start writing. Don't look at the paper, don't think about what you're writing, even if it's just scribbles. It's supposed to be this gateway into your subconscious or something.

Anyway, I hadn't taken my turn yet, but a guy who was a mutual friend of another girl at the party was up next. He seemed uninterested at first, but finally he shut his eyes and picked up the pen and began to write. We were a bit distracted at that point, and I glanced back every once in a while during the minute or so it took him, didn't notice anything odd. Finally he stops writing and pulls back, and we all look.

There, towards the bottom of the page, in very clear letters, is my secret name.

The rest was scribbly and nonsense, only that bit was absolutely readable. One of the girls actually read it and wondered aloud what it meant. The guy said it just ""popped into my head.""

One night my uncle was driving back from town through the country to his home. It was not an area that he was familiar with, it was farm country with few homes and large distances between them. He ran out of gas. 

He walked up the road to the first farmhouse. There was a gas pump out front as many farmers keep a decent supply on hand. He walked up the driveway and knocked on the door. An elderly couple answered and he explained his situation. They were kind and happy to help. The husband got him a can and they went to the pump and he put a couple of gallons of gas from the pump into the can. My uncle walked back to the car and put the gas in the tank. He brought the can back and offered them some money for the gas. They wouldn't take any money and just said they were glad they could help. He thanked them and drove home. 

My uncle looks like a lumber jack. He was 6' 6"" tall over 300 lbs with a full beard. He was one of those gentle giant kind of guys and although you would never guess it by looking at him one of his favorite things was to bake pies. So the next day he bakes a pecan pie to bring back to the couple who gave him the gas. He drove back to the house and knocked on the door, but nobody was home. 

He drove down the road to the next house and went to the door to see if he could leave the pie with the neighbors. When he talked to the neighbors they told him the house he was talking about had been abandoned. Figuring he must have gone to the wrong house he drove along the road looking for the right place. When he couldn't find another farmhouse that looked anything like the one he got the gas from he drove back a second time. 

The gas pump was there and he was sure that it was the right house, but it was empty. He went back to the neighbors again and said he had been to the house the night before and an elderly couple had given him gas. He described them to the neighbors and they said, the people you're describing used to live there, but they've been dead for years.

After he told the story, I asked him what he thought and he said he couldn't explain it. He went back to the farm to check the pump and it wasn't working. This was the only story of this kind I had ever heard him tell. He wasn't a boaster or an exaggerator and he told the story sort of matter of factly, like I don't know I can't explain it. 

I only heard him tell the story once and he seemed reluctant to share it until his wife prodded him.

So back when I was in high school, when those Nokia phones with the changeable faceplates were real common, I got my first cell phone. It was also a Nokia, but it was a cheaper model, no user-changeable faceplate, and it was a Tracfone per-paid deal. I think it had a Nimh battery or some other technology because the instruction manual said that it had to be ""deep discharged"" every so often, which consisted of running the battery all the way down to zero power and then charging it back up to full. 

So I was doing his deep discharge thing one night and i get the battery run down, and once it's dead I remove the battery from the phone and set it to the side. Then, the phone starts making noise as if I had called someone with it. So I hold the phone up to my ear to listen, and I hear a woman pick up and say, ""Hello?"" Of course I say nothing, but just then a man says, ""oh hey! It's me!"" and they start having a conversation about nothing in particular, just catching up with each other it seems. Keep in mind the battery of the phone is still lying on the ground, and the phone's screen isn't lit up or anything, just the earpiece is playing this conversation between these people. 

At this point I NOPE'D and plugged the charger in and replaced the battery, and the conversation instantly stopped and the phone acted like normal.

I had mentioned to my coworkers that I was heading to Zips. (drive in diner style place for those who don't have them in your area) I was seeing if anyone wanted me to pick something up for them and on account of the place being cheap and quite good, it wouldn't have burned a hole in my wallet. My supervisor Martin asked what the special was, I had no idea but he asked if I'd grab him whatever that was and he'd let me off a couple hours early. I had been working the swing shift, that's usually anywhere from 1pm-9:30, 10:00pm, so a few hours more of my evening was a great bargaining tool. I agreed, and was headed out to my car when a girl I work with, Angela asked if she could tag along. I could use the company, and she was always friendly when we spoke so I saw no problem with it. 

So, we're in the car, making conversation about our calls today(we work in a call center) and bitching about a few customers who called in, and we finally pull up to Zips after a few minutes. We go through the drive through on account of our lunch breaks are only a half an hour, order a food and then as we're pulling out a white truck blasts into the parking lot, right where the drive through ends and smashes into the side of my car. I close my eyes, open them back up and I'm pulling through the drive through with Angela getting ready to order our food. 

I stopped, waited a few minutes and saw the white truck come ripping through the parking lot, right across the spot where I had just witnessed myself and Angela get hit.

1368621615.0,168,self.Glitch_in_the_Matrix,1ednl0,I had a key to a room before the room existed,197,29,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix/comments/1ednl0/i_had_a_key_to_a_room_before_the_room_existed/,"A bit of backstory: I'm a hoarder and I collect random things. I particularly love little shiny rocks, unusually shaped bolts and nails, that kind of thing. I LOVE keys. As a kid I used to collect all the old keys we didn't use anymore, and I distinctly recall getting in trouble once at school because I stole the storeroom key (it was a really cool-looking key.) Over the years my parents, and other older relatives, would find this adorable and give me keys they no longer needed, for my collection. I also collected keys that I found in the park, at yard sales, that kind of thing. In my senior year of high school I decided to conclusively quit this habit; I remember this because my boyfriend at the time bought me a beautiful jar to display all my little trinkets in. The year after that I moved out to go to university and didn't even unpack the jar for almost a year. When I did unpack it it was still sealed with a cork and I displayed it on my bookshelf but never added to it again - it became just a cute anecdote about my childhood.

In my junior year of university, I did some research work for a professor, and he gave me a key to his office for convenience. After carrying the key around for a few days I suddenly remembered that one of the keys in my collection looked a bit like this key. (I remembered it because these two keys were quite unique - the best way I can describe it is that it's double-ridged, like how most keys only have one bumpy thing you stick in the keyhole, this one had two parallel ones on the same key.) I went home and found the other key, which was about halfway down the jar and near the outside (i.e. it's very unlikely I added it after I put everything in the jar in high school). I didn't remember when or where I'd gotten the key. To my disappointment, it didn't open the professor's office, and I concluded that despite looking similar it must be a different key. Still, I decided to start carrying the second key around, in case it opened some other door on campus. I thought it would be pretty cool if it did. Either at that time or at some later point, I became vaguely aware that the key had the initials ""IS"" written in whiteout on the top bit (like the bit you hold.)

At my university, in my faculty's building, there's a room that only a few students who are enrolled in a particular senior unit have access to - I'm going to call it the 'Independent Study Room'. Every semester, this unit enrols exactly five students, who each gets given a key to this room. In the second semester of my junior year, one of my closest friends, let's call him Jake, was doing this unit. One day Jake asked to borrow a pen and I told him to rifle through my purse; he asked ""why do you have a key to the IS room?"" and I replied something like ""I don't know, I have a lot of keys?"" and then we quickly became distracted by something else. (He knew about my collection of keys and I guess I assumed he was asking about one of those. My recollection of this bit is fuzzy, beyond recalling that the conversation occured. As you can expect, at the time I did not attach significance to it.)

Fast forward to the end of semester. It's Friday. I am on campus despite not having class on a Friday because I was at the library and decided to hang around waiting for a guy I like to finish class so we could have coffee. (Strangely, I recall that fact most vividly.) I am sitting outside the faculty building and I see Jake approaching in a suit. I recall that he has an important interview today for a graduate job. 

As Jake gets closer I realise he looks veeeery stressed. He walks right up to me and says 'holy shit - you have an IS key don't you?' It took me a beat but somehow in that moment I just knew exactly what he was referring to - I know that sounds corny, I can't really explain it any other way, except that I knew he was referring to this mystery key I've been carrying around, which I pull out of my bag and hand to him. He says 'thank god, I *will* explain later' and just runs off.

I later find out that he'd locked all of his belongings in the IS room and was already running late for the interview. All of the documents he needed for the interview were in that room. If he hadn't run into me or someone else with a key, he would have had to call the building attendant, who would have taken at least an hour verifying his identity and then finding the key to the room to let him in. Nobody else from that unit was on campus that day because, again, not many people had class on Fridays.

Needless to say, Jake got the job. If that had been the end of the story I would have said it was an absolutely amazing coincidence but not a glitch - I find a key that I have no business owning and accidentally save my friend's interview with it. Nobody in my family had anything to do with the university so I most likely found the key somewhere, which made it more serendipitous.

But here's the bit that makes it a glitch: this building we're talking about was only built in my sophomore year. I stopped collecting keys in high school. I am absolutely sure about the timeline here because all of the marketing material for the faculty from my senior year reference the fact that they were going to move the whole faculty to this new building. And again, not only did I actively stop collecting keys in high school, but this key was lodged in my collection jar in such a way that it could not possibly have been added later.

I have two possible non-glitch explanations for this:
1. Maybe I am misremembering some fact, for example, maybe I did add some keys after university and just shook up the jar. This seems highly unlikely though - this habit of mine has been dwindling since at least my junior year of high school, to the extent that I more or less remember the last five keys I added to the collection, because they were all very unique/interesting and I wasn't just collecting them for the sake of it.
2. Maybe the key opened the original Independent Study Room in the old building and they simply used the exact same lock here, for some reason? Or maybe by the time I found the key the room had already been built in the new building, even though the rest of the building wasn't complete - this one seems less likely though, because I'm pretty sure the building was in its skeletal form when I visited the campus for the first time at the end of high school.

My glitch-in-the-matrix explanation for this is that it was *so vital* to the universe that Jake get this job, for whatever reason, that a large part of my whole life has been directed towards being in the right place at the right time to let him into the room so he wouldn't be late for this interview. Who knows, maybe this job helps him become a world famous person in his field or cure cancer or something. Why the universe couldn't have done this by simply not letting him lock himself out of the IS room, I have no idea.

**tl;dr found a key in high school that opens the door of a room in a building that didn't get built until my sophomore year of college, might have cured cancer.**

I posted this with a sock because my main account is fairly active in my university's reddit group and i didn't want people to ask me about it on campus. Some facts changed, like the name of the Independent Study Room, but all other facts are the same. I never told Jake the full story; as far as he's concerned, it's a lucky coincidence that his friend happens to have a key to this room and was on campus that day. Typing it out like that, without more, it does actually seem like an almost boring coincidence.

He's under this tiny overhang above the door and the light is burned out so it's just as dark as can be.  He seems to be wearing a hoodie exactly like mine with jeans to match as well.  His head is tilted down and I can't see his face but as I continue around the sidewalk towards him I see his arm go up like he was waving at me.  I look behind myself but nobody is there so I kind of nod and wave back.  I don't really regard this as spooky or anything as there are people out smoking and just being weird all the time anyway trying to strike up inane conversations with the paper guy.

I make my way around to where the guy was standing, not paying any mind, and I realize he's gone back inside his house apparently even though I didn't hear a door or walking.  As I approach the place where he was standing, not far from my car, I drop my hoodie and remove the neck gaiter I was using to keep my face warm but I'm not sweating from the long walk.  Hoodie goes back up and I'm stopped in place to adjust my MP3 player when I hear someone call out.

I look up and back across, where I just was, is this nice old guy walking his dog who I usually run into every morning.  I wave in the exact manner of the stranger who waved at me before.

I finally had a chance to catch up with my father this afternoon. Since I still get measagea about my orginal thread from time to time I figured there might still be some interest. Something I had read on reddit came up while talking and I decided I would work my dreams into the conversation.

Unfortunately there isn't much to report. My father has no memory of my orginal memories. He enjoyed the stories but didn't have much to say about them.  It did result in a good talk about Freud and the neuroscience of what happens when you dream. Thats about it.

Of course, we could theorize that if I am a time traveler in my dreams and he is protecting me from myself, he would probably not tell me how to foil him.

So there you have it. I think I'll have to come up with a better ending if I ever write a book.

She was doing her best to get me to stop reading so I absentmindedly gave her a beef trachea to chew on with while I continued with my book. She quickly got bored chewing by herself so she climbed up on me, trachea in mouth, to get me to play with her. This is where stuff got weird.

I was sitting on my bed cover with my legs stretched and slightly spread apart. Coco clumsily climbed on my legs and then accidentally dropped the beef trachea in the gap between my thighs. I spread my legs to fish the chew out and give it back to her but found nothing. I thought it maybe got under my butt somehow so I moved form my spot but no beef ring in sight. I stood from the bed but there was nothing on it beside Coco who was still sniffing all over, looking for the chew. 

After much searching and unmaking of the bed sheets neither of us ever found it and so it seemingly just disappeared into the void that is my crotch.

We have a large van, so when we go camping, we usually just stick our mattress in the back and sleep in the car. This particular night of camping, I was sleeping very poorly, and I kept having these cycling dreams where I would wake up in the car where I was sleeping, see something outside of the car, and go investigate. Most of these dreams were really mundane: bears, racoons, other campers, but one of them stood out to me. The dream was this:

I wake up in the car where I am sleeping. My clothes are exactly the same, ect. There is a light outside of the car and I can see the silhouette of a man about 10 paces away from my vehicle. I get up, get out of the car and walk over to where the man is standing. He is wearing all white/silver streamlined clothing and has a shaved head and a very androgynous face. He is very tall and has long fingers. He looks human but has a vaguely alienlike look. He says to me ""I can't tell you more, but you must be at *specific place*, mid-day, on April 10, 2030. You will become a very important in events that will unfold."" He puts in my hands a set of car keys (or I assumed that they were car keys. They didn't look like any car keys that we have today.) I looked down to examine the keys and then realized that I couldn't remember where he said to be. I looked up to ask him but he was gone. I put the keys in my pocket, turn around and get back into my car and go to sleep. 

I woke up for real a few moments later and check my pocket for the keys. It was only after they were not there that I realized that it was a dream. Of course the whole thing was probably just a really bizarre dream, but I've never had a dream that was so specific. It was so realistic and vivid. I could draw the man's face, the clothes he was wearing, and what the keys looked like. Also, that date! What the fuck?

But il try posting this again. I have no explanation for this occurrence, and to this day am freaked the fuck out by what happened. Let me just say before re-writing all this when I went to Initially post it just kept freezing and then the text out of nowhere disappeared. So il try again. In 11th grade we were given an assignment to read a book that was once banned then to write about why it was banned at one point and how we felt about the book. I picked from the hat/ bowl a strip of paper that read the catcher in the Rye. I had heard of the book but had never read it and surely did not know its story line. My english teacher said to me ""Hey, Nextxoxexit I have a copy of the book in the lost library you can take"". We had a small bookshelf in class with lost or donated books that you could take if you do so pleased. She was trying to save me the hassle of renting or buying it. I went to the shelf and found it there grabbed it and threw it in my locker. Later that day I grabbed it and began reading whilst waiting for my late bus to arrive. Now for context Il say Im not big into reading for pleasure. In fact I dont think I have ever read a book that I wasn't assigned to read for a class. But this book drew me in like nothing I had read before. I think I felt compelled to read it because I related to the main character in his teenage troubles. 30 min later we came up on my stop. I stood up and stood behind my neighbor who gets off at the same spot as me. We made small talk and got off the bus once the doors opened. Then it happened. I was suddenly back in my seat on the bus. The 20 or so kids who were set to get off the bus after me were gone. The bus was empty except for the same driver and bus aide we had. We were pulling into the school to park the bus. I stood up real fast and ran to the front of the bus.The bus driver and aid looked at me like I was a ghost. Both has sworn I had gotten off. The aide said she had even checked all the seats twice and I had not been been there. Afterall I was only seated 3 or 4 seats from the front so I was easily seen from the front. Though pissed because he had to go drop me off now the driver, aide, And I were all equally creeped out. Upon arriving back at my spot he let me out. I ran to my neighbors and confirmed with him that I had in fact chatted with him and gotten off at our usual spot together. Once inside my home I looked at my book to find that I was 100 pgs further then where I had left off when We got to my spot the first time. I figured in my hustle I had skipped a section and marked the book mark wrong but upon re-reading I recognized everything to a T. There was no way that even if I had read the entire time I would get through 100  pgs, at my speed 25 at the max. I was so creeped out but I finished the book and wrote my report to which I was credited 100%. I kept that copy but am still creeped out by it to this day. Later I found out this was the same book ( not the same copy just the same read)  David Chapman was reading when he murdered John Lennon, a copy was found at the scene of the crime. Apparently the book drove him to insanity. It might not relate to this at all, but I found it disturbing considering my event. 
was my spicific copy from the book shelf haunted/cursed?
does this book make people zone out beyond their control?
did I fall asleep and just nobody saw me there? But how does that account for the 100 pgs read?
I really dont know. To this day it sticks with me.

I then told my mom that everything was fine i was at work, not drunk, and the wife and kids were fine.



Second incident

About 3 years ago (1 year after the first incident) I was at work and i get a call from my wife, She said "" where the Heck are you, im at the house ready to go!"" "" I am at work, why are you not at work, and where are we going?"" I said.

I am currently seeing someone over this illusion in my imagination or glitch in the matrix.


It all started about 5 years ago. I was in a Sheetz ( A Pittsburgh area convenience store ). I was walking around looking for a snack to eat. I grabbed for a snack I think it was a slim jim. But someone else was next to me and tripped into me.  It was a guy about my age. Somehow I ended up in his position on the ground and he ended up on the position that he was the one bumped into and had a slim jim in his hand. The store clerk helped me up so I know it wasn't my imagination. We exchanged apologies as I wasn't sure what happened and went on our way.


After that, I went home and my brain was getting fuzzier by the second. I slowly over the next weeks started having memories that weren't mine. I remember all these memories of being a guy, playing football in middle school, and everything. I remember these things but everything that would identify is hazy. Like I don't see or remember names, I don't recognize faces, nothing.


But I still remember all these female memories from school and growing up. I still remember everything so no amnesia. 


It's gotten to the point where I am not sure if we swapped identities maybe I used to be him and he used to be me? That's why I am seeing someone I know they think I am crazy and had some very weird dream and maybe possible dreams with memories coming afterward.

Hes coming with his wife and 3 kids for a few days. Anyways, yesterday I was listening to music browsing /r/pics when my dog started barking up a storm. Took off my headphones and went to see who was knocking. My Uncle Robert is standing there with a huge smile. He told me they just wanted to stop by to say hi before going to the hotel. My parents were at a friends house an hour away, so I quickly texted my mom to hurry home because they just got here. I was overjoyed and quickly allowed them inside and offered them food. They just wanted Coke so I gave them the glasses and went on talking. We exchanged pleasantries and my aunt asked me how I adjusted to my new school and how glad I was that it was finally summer. My little cousins asked to watch some tv and they were content just watching Nickelodeon. Everything went rather smoothly despite me being typically awkward and unprepared for them.

My Uncle Robert just told me to tell my mom to call them when my parents got home. I agreed, we said our goodbyes, and they went to their hotel. I put my dog back inside, since she hadn't stopped barking since they got here. Note, that isn't strange at all for her. She hasnt seen them in years and they're strangers to her. Nothing out of the ordinary. I went to clean my room up a little and waited for my mom and dad to get home.

A few hours passed and my parents got home. I talked to my mom and told her to call my uncle since they got here. My mom gave me a bewildered look. ""What do you mean?"" She asked curiously. ""I mean they came, I talked to them for a while, and they went to their hotel to unpack."" I knew something was up when she just stared at me uncomfortably. The curiousity was gone and she looked scared for a moment. ""Sweetie, they're still in Arizona. I spoke to them this morning and if they keep driving they should get here by tomorrow night."" By the look of her face and her personality I knew she wasnt playing a joke on me. ""Mom, they were here. I saw them."" Her face turned suspicious ""You're not being funny (my name). If you're bullshitting-"" ""Mom, I swear I'm not."" She took out her phone and showed me a picture from my aunts Facebook of my aunt, uncle, and their kids smiling in front of the Grand Canyon. Here's the part that made me start shaking, they were all wearing the same clothes. Then she showed me the date. June 27. 12:17 P.M.

My mother dismissed it as being tired and imagining this. I came to my room feeling awful. I HUGGED them. I felt their clothes and smelled my aunts perfume. Not only that, but the cups and my dog. Give me an explanation for her barking ridiculously if I was just dreaming it up. They didn't know our new address yet knew that I had just changed schools.

I have no explanation for this. I've bombarded my head with all kinds of possibilites and nothing. No history of mental illness or anything.

This is crazy and I've never told anyone everything at the same time as I would probably be taken to the insane asylum.

It all started when I was 15.. I woke up in the morning and got out of my bed. To this day I always just throw the clothes I wore the day before at the foot of my bed. I walk and step on something that feels puffy. So I pick it up.... and underneath my clothes from the night before I see a pink stripped bra with a heart bow. I also see a cardigan sweater. I am literally dumbstruck... how could this get in my room. I had no girlfriend and no girl was ever in my room. I have an older brother at college but no way a girl could put those there.

In the sweater I found a crumbled up piece of paper.. It's a scantron test form (for those not familiar computerized multiple choice test). On it is written ""Emily [mylastname]"" I have no cousins or relatives by that name. It also said Physics as subject which would be the year above me in my high school curriculum. I checked the yearbook and couldn't find anyone with my last name (which is not that common). 

I wasn't dreaming because I ate breakfast and went back up and looked at it again before taking the bus. I then hid them under my mattress. When I got home.. they were gone.

I never told anyone this story.
 
When I moved to college. After the first week I got a call from the RA of the women's area of my dorm. Apparently they found a CD with my label makered CD in a closet. I thought for sure I had the CD but it was gone.  I assumed someone stole it as I never set foot in the female dorms or it went in a portal to the other way and found itself with my female self in a female dorm. Then it looped back to the right dimension. 

When I was 19, I woke up one night hearing, ""Emily wake up!"" like 5 times. I thought it was a dream and it might have been. 

Now, I found out years later that my Mother miscarried a year before me. After they had me my parents decided 2 was enough and had tubes tied. So, if the miscarried child lived I wouldn't have been born. I never asked if they knew the gender because I heard my parents took it very hard. 

This is a throwaway account because when I was 19 years old after the last incident.... I began to crossdress sometimes. I am now 27 years old.. I haven't had any experiences since but I found this subbredit today and had to share this with the internet anonymously.

The morning after it was fixed, I walked to my bathroom to get ready for school as usual and when I thumped my hands down onto the sink after washing my face, it sort of cracked and gave way. I tried to grab the edges of the sink to put it back into place because I was afraid of what my mom would say, but my hand slipped and a huge protruding shard of ceramic just slid into my stomach. 

It was the most excruciating pain I've ever known - even today I can get kicked in the balls with only a slight flinch - and I collapsed to the floor. I remember seeing blood on my fingers as I held them up and I remember my mother's scream when she walked in. After suffering for a few more minutes, everything started to fade and blur and I assumed that I was dying.

I sat up, screaming in my bed and this is where shit get's creepy. I never had a habit of pulling out clumps of hair; I never had a ceramic bathroom sink and no repairs had ever been done to that bathroom. My mom is far crueler than I remember and my hands look different from how they always have been.

I think I died in one reality and when the wavefunction collapsed, I kinda strolled into this one.

We had 16 screens that I would run by myself and occasionally a part time hand named Zach, sometimes until 3 or 4 in the morning for midnight releases. Anyway, one night around 2 in the morning I'm putting together a new trailer reel alone for a movie while a midnight showing is finishing up. I finish the reel and begin walking down the corridor between the projectors to clean up my film clippings when this fucking noise scares the shit out of me. Standing between two of the projectors is this life-size cut-out of Lindsay Lohan in a race suit. There's one of those electronic voice boxes warbling out a shitty catch phrase. I laughed at it thinking that an employee had stayed after hours to sneak up into my booth with this thing. I call out to them but no one answers. I take a quick stroll through the movie theater but no one is there except for the audience in the midnight release. I go back upstairs and let myself back into the booth to throw out the cardboard Lindsay, except that she's not there anymore. I finish out my shift and leave at 3 am feeling really disturbed and pissed at someone for messing with me. The next day at work I come in to find out who had messed with me. Everyone denies it. Fast forward 2 months. We receive this giant cardboard promotion for this movie ""Herbie Fully Loaded"". There she is, staring at me. The damn cut out. I was a little confused how someone had gotten a cardboard cut out for the movie when we hadn't even received one yet, but I just decided not to think about it. Three weeks later I throw the whole thing into the trash compactor, including Lindsay Lohan. The fucking thing will not compact her, no matter what I do (Keep in mind that this thing would flatten a washing machine). The compactor stops and goes into reverse as soon as it gets close to crushing Lindsay. I pull it out and begin to tear it apart when it literally turned to vapor. I really can't describe it, I still think I may have been hallucinating off of the trash fumes. It was just gone, right out of my hands....Like it had turned from a solid into a gas instantaneously. Then all of a sudden the trash compactor starts up and I here this warbled voice box saying something that vaguely sounded like ""Fully Loaded"" before it was crushed. It may have been a trick of the light, but right before it was completely crushed I caught a glimpse of it. The cut out looked extremely faded, like it had sat in the sun for a year or two.

I am not into weddings, so I skipped it - as I skip all weddings. After some time, during a usual evening home visit, I asked them to show me some photos from their wedding. It was before digital photography and they told me they had done some photos during their wedding but sadly they had spent all their money on the ceremony and the party and hadn't have money left to buy the pictures from the photographer shop - well, I am Romanian, it was during Ceausescu's dictatorship and money used to be a great issue back then. So they had not one picture from their wedding, they were frustrated by this but had no money or the courage to go retrieve them from the shop.

Several years passed, times changed, the city went under construction, lots of demolitions and construction going on. I was walking one day across a great demolished area with rubble, garbage, big holes in the ground, some blocks going to be erected over an ex-slummy place. Then, I saw something at a bottom of a 3-4 meters deep hole in the ground, a small spot, like a torn tiny piece of colored paper, nothing to discern from that distance. Against all my normal behavior, I stepped down into that muddy hole and picked up that thing. It was a torn piece of photograph from my friend's wedding. Only them, their figures, in their wedding suits, smiling at camera.

I gave them that little colored patch of picture, it has been their only graphic memory from their wedding.

It's worth to say that we didn't consider this as  something abnormal or special, we took it just as a strike of luck. But now, thinking about it, I can't stop asking myself: what were the odds. I simply don't go down into muddy holes without serious reasons.

So I make the shake, microwave the chicken, and go to the bathroom for a few minutes. When I come out, I can't find the shake. My chicken is sitting right there on the table, but I can't find the shake. 

My friends, I walked around my small apartment for over an hour looking for that fucking shake. There were only 3 rooms it could have been in; the kitchen, the living room, or my room. The only other person there was my mom, and she was asleep. I ended up waking her up with my searching and she helped me look to no avail.

This happened last night, and I was debating whether to post it here, but I can't explain it so here goes nothing:

A few weeks back, I stumbled upon a promotion someone posted on reddit for a free Panda ecigarette. I thought to myself 'sweet', as I've been trying to cut back on my smoking, so I go to the website and fill out my info. They didn't need a CC number or anything so I figured I had nothing to lose. The order goes through, I then had to confirm my ID, which I did, and everything seemed normal. 

I went back to the reddit post I had originally seen this deal on, and people were complaining that the offer was not valid in Canada. Funny, I thought, my order worked just fine and I'm in Montreal. To make sure, I went to the Panda site, where you can livechat with customer service. I ask the person if I'll recieve my ecig, and she tells me that unfourtunately, I would not, as the offer is indeed not valid in Canada. Oh well, sucks, but whatever. I didn't think much about it after that.

Fast forward to yesterday. I got home from work, and, to my great surprise, a package was waiting for me. I opened it up to find an electronic cigarette from panda! Cool, I thought. Surprises are great and so is free shit. Can't complain!

I proceed to get in the house and sit on the couch to try out my new nicotine delivery device. I take a few drags, and then my best friend knocks at the door. I put down the cig on my end table and go answer. She comes in, we talk a bit, and then I tell her my minor success story about the ecig. I go to pick it up on the end table - it's gone. Thing is, my friend saw it there too. We then spend the next hour searching EVERYWHERE for the stupid thing, it was driving us nuts. My house is really small and I'm a pretty neat person in general. I have no idea what happened to that electronic cigarette. It just... vanished.

When I was younger, around 11 or 12, I was swimming with my brothers and our friends at the lake. One of the friends who was with us came from a wealthy family and had brought a [floating trampoline](http://i.imgur.com/FNJewWC.jpg) for us all to play on while we were swimming. The trampoline was tethered to the bottom of the lake with an anchor. A lot of the kids who had played with the trampoline before like to swim under it where there was a net that they would pretend was a table at an underwater club. My father was watching us swim but had went to the camper as my step mom had called him for something.

Then I decided I wanted to go the underwater club.

When I swam down someone had just jumped off of the trampoline causing the rope tied to the anchor to have some slack. The rope had some how wrapped itself around my leg when the trampoline floated back up, holding me under the water. I was panicking pretty badly and just thrashing underwater trying to get free. My mind was racing, I didn't know what to do and I didn't want to die. I finally got to the point where I couldn't hold my breath anymore. I breathed in desperation, but was met with only water. Then I felt myself die. It was the most calming relaxing thing I  have ever felt. I just knew everything was going to be okay and I didn't have to worry anymore. It was very disturbing how good it felt. But then it was like time reversed to the point just before I breathed in the water. Experiencing my death had left me oddly calm. I was able to stop panicking and muster up all of my strength to hold my breath and pull the rope slack on my leg to get my self free. I still breathed in water on the way up but I was able to get to shore, where I coughed it back up.

The following days defined the rest of my life so far. I decided that day that I would treat everyone and everything with the utmost respect. I respect all life now, even the most miniscule of bugs or annoying of pests. I treat everyone I meet as kindly as possible, and help anyone who I can.

My friend (I'll call him ""Mike"") and I were playing one of the Halo games (it was about 7-8 years ago I think). Anyway, we were at his house alone and had been in his room playing for several hours. We had been sitting there playing for so long I had sort of forgotten about the rest of the world.           
Suddenly, we heard a knock at the door. I knew we were home alone when we started playing, but it had been so long it wasn't strange to think that someone had come home and made it upstairs without us hearing them. Still, as soon as I heard the knock it creeped me out a bit. It was a strange repeating pattern of two knocks then a pause; one-two stop, one-two stop. Mike didn't seem scared by it at all, and yelled for whoever it was to come in. No answer. The knock continued and he must have decided it was his younger brother (let's call him ""John""). He and his brother were always messing with each other, and he got annoyed pretty quickly. He yelled for John to stop because we were trying to play, and when the knock didn't stop he paused the game and ran to the door. He yelled something about how he was going to beat the shit out of John, and we could hear footsteps running away from the door to John's room down the hall.          
As soon as he threw open the door, the door to John's room slammed shut. Mike ran down the hall and I got up and followed to see what was going on. At this point my 'creeped-out' feeling was completely gone, as we had figured out who it was. Mike got to his brother's door and found it unlocked. He opened it as hard as he could and saw... nothing. No one was in the room. We weren't startled at first, we assumed he had gone under the bed or in the closet. After searching the room pretty thoroughly, we simultaneously looked at each other and I felt a wave of fear grip my chest. It was so strange and we had no explanation for what had just happened. The noises were somewhat explainable, but the door slamming like that (not just shutting, slamming) really scared us.           
We left the game on and stayed downstairs until his brother and parents eventually got home. We didn't tell them what had happened, but them being home made us feel better. I stayed at his house that night, and after a few hours of being scared we had gone back to playing Halo, business as usual. The night passed without anything else weird happening.          
The next day, as John, Mike and I were eating breakfast in the early afternoon, we started talking about dreams for whatever reason. John said he had a dream that night of walking over to Mike's room and knocking on his door. That's all he remembered, but immediately we freaked out and told him. It could all be a coincidence, but it seems a little glitchy to me.     
        
**TL;DR:** Knocking on the door, no one around to have done it. Later, friend's brother has a dream about knocking on the door.

I was on a week-long scuba trip on this yacht with about thirty other kids from my school. One day we inflated this big bag that they use to recover sunken ships so we can try launching each other off of it. This one bigger kid wants to be launched so we decide two of us should jump off the top of the yacht in order to launch him. The first time worked perfectly, but the second time we get our timing off and I ended up landing on the other kid head first.

I remember super clearly watching myself falling and hit my head. I specifically remember seeing myself go limp and fall into the water because I thought to myself that kids going to drown. I started to swim over to try and help the kid, when suddenly I realized I was the kid. I opened my eyes and I was almost on the ocean floor (the water was only about 15 feet deep where we were at the time) so I swam up as quickly as I could and swam for the boat.

Last March, I had just picked up a part time job at a Papa John's in Kansas City.

One uneventful night, a customer came to pick up the pizza he ordered over the phone. He was an elderly looking man, maybe in his early 50's and he was there to pick up a large ""the meats"" pizza. I can't exactly remember his name because it's been so long, so let's call him John Anderson. (It sounds about right)

Well John Anderson hands me a credit card to pay for it with his name on it, I hand him the receipt, give him the pizza, and he signs it and even leaves a tip! I was happy and bid him farewell and to have a nice dinner. 

This is where it get's a little weird for me. Maybe 30 minutes later a younger man walks in and asks for his pizza. I ask him for his name, and he says, ""John Anderson"". I checked the store, and I didn't see his pizza. He told me his phone number so I could look in the system to find it, and saw he ordered a pizza about an hour ago. Right under the order, it said ""completed"". This is when I remember the old man.

I asked him about the old man, to check to see if maybe his friend or dad came in earlier to pick it up for him and he said no. I told him sorry and that it was probably a mistake and put his pizza in the oven promptly. He hands me a card to pay for it, and behold, it also says, ""John Anderson"". 

Now it wasn't the same card because the system would tell me anytime a card is used more than once in the same day. Also, when the old man came in earlier, he gave me the same phone number with the same pizza order as the younger man. I will never know what happened that night, maybe it was all just a prank.

While I was walking to work, I took out my phone to check the time. That's a habit of mine, to check the time at a certain point on my walk. It's was 8:46, I was ahead of schedule. It was nice to be ahead of schedule. I put my phone back in my purse and went on with my day. At around 12:30, I went on my break. I got my purse and looked for my phone but it was missing. It wasn't in my coat pocket, either. I tried calling it, but I never heard it ring. At that point I figured I must've dropped it when I thought I put it back in my bag. I didn't remember hearing it hit the ground, but I figured it might've hit a patch of grass or maybe a bus had driven by or something. I told coworkers and my boss I couldn't find it. I was on my break so I went online and posted on my timeline about it. As I was walking home, I looked for it at the spot where I remembered putting it back in my bag. I didn't find anything.

When I got home, it was on my floor in my room.

How can it be that I checked the time on my phone while walking to work if it was at home on my bedroom floor all day?
Did I imagine looking at my phone? Was my imagination so convincing and so seamless that I went through the trouble of looking for my phone while on my break at work? I never suspected that I might not have actually looked at it. Like I said, I even told coworkers and my boss and posted on facebook about it. I truly believed that I held that phone in my hand and checked the time, and then lost it at some point, up until the very moment I saw it on my floor when I got home. How can this be? I'm confused and frankly slightly frightened. I very distinctly continue to remember having held it in my hand. Now I'm questioning my self and everything.
Has something similar ever happened to you? Do you know anything about things like this? What is this?

8 years ago I was 17 years old and in high school. A friend of mine had a car. One time, we were driving to her house after school and we hit what we later called a ""time portal"". We had been driving down a very familiar road, turned the familiar corner, and found ourselves on a different road than we expected. When we looked back, we did't see the road we'd just been driving on. It was as if we'd been driving on this side of town the whole time, but that was impossible unless we'd just been imagining things. We never were quite sure what happened that day. It's not like we were fooling around or getting high in the car or something, we were just driving to her house like any other day.

I was walking down the stairs in my house, to get dinner, when I noticed a glinting at the corner of my eye. I looked down and saw my house key, which I'm pretty sure was in my pocket upstairs, so I picked it up, put it in my pocket and carried on down stairs to eat.

Well everything was fine for about 20 minutes while I was eating, and when I was done I needed to go to the bathroom. So away I go along to the bathroom, until I notice the same glint in my eye. I look down again and see the key... The same key still in my pocket. I took the key out of my pocket and what do you know... I now have two of the same key.

I pick up the other key and take it back to the kitchen, when my mum notices my puzzled expression and asks what's wrong. I show her the two keys and now she is just as puzzled as I am, because there is only two keys to enter this house, and she still has hers.

Thinking nothing of it, apart from being slightly weirded out, I go back to the bathroom, putting the keys back in the pocket of my jacket and setting it in my room, while I go to the bathroom.

When I come back out and go to check my jacket for the keys, there is only one there now? I check the ground all around the jacket, and the stairs, and it's just gone.

Before it disappeared, I checked both keys for differences, and there was none, same number code and everything! Same rust, same numbers. I also checked the key that didn't dissapeer to see if it worked in my door, and it did. 

So I don't know what happened with the other key, but I know my parents didn't take it. My stairs are squeaky as anything and I would have heard them come up, it just vanished out of thin air.

Being on a major highway however, there was always an abundance of traffic. My house was at the end of a street that was perpendicular to the highway, about 400 metres away from the intersection. 400 metres of undeveloped green-space with no trees or structures to obstruct the view. Everyday on my way to school or anywhere else in town, I would walk down this street, with at least a kilometre of the highway in plain sight the entire distance (I lived considerably uphill from the intersection and had a wide perspective).   
   
Everyday for eleven years I would walk this distance and the highway would be in sight, visibly devoid of any cars or pedestrians or life. I could always hear birds singing in the summer and the wind blowing in the winter, But never any cars. And then, just as I was within a stones throw, like a video game loading graphics the highway would inevitably become a sudden storm of cars, trucks, semis, people and even the odd horse carriage, impossible to even cross. Every single day for 11 years. I would often watch the highway from my second story window, never a sign of life in sight. I remember wondering as a small child if I was part of some bizarre simulation, where the passers-by only existed as they did in my consciousness.  
    
Last week I visited my mother, who still lives in that very same old house on the hill. As I sat on the front porch, contemplating the emptiness of the highway I decided to try one more time. So I took that nostalgic trek down my street. past my neighbours' house, past the old Wilson farm, past the mailboxes, and through the field. And to my amazement, just as it had my entire childhood in that town, the old empty highway suddenly sprang to life, with the same frenzy of activity that it always had when I was a young man.  
   
Although seemingly ordinary and insignificant, this experience has always haunted me in some way.

Its august 17th, the summer after freshman year, i had received news that a really good friend that I had feelings for died, I was traumatized. I went to her brothers house and had a crying session with him. Her funeral was exactly a week later. I attended it and kept to myself, and gave my prayers to the family.

This is where it gets weird. That next morning on Facebook I see her post about getting her tonsils out. At first I thought it was a horrible prank, because the operation is what caused her death. That is, until my sister called me telling me about her death. I instantly hang up the phone and my head starts to ache. I look at my phone and the date is August 17th.

It gets worse, I look up when I hear my dogs barking and I see her brothers car driving into my drive way. He runs up to my door and I open the door and he collapses onto me in tears. I start crying for whatever reason, we never even talked to each other that whole time. At 1:30 the next day I get a call from her mom about the funeral. 

That morning I had talked to my mom about it, and she said that I must have dreamt about it last night. Needless to say, I was scared. After that I refused to tell anyone because I know that people would think it was a ploy to receive attention and people would label me as crazy from the trauma.

Now there is NOTHING in Nebraska, except corn fields, with very few exits on the interstate. We had just passed an exit, with an old Texaco with a barely lit sign above it visible from the interstate. We got a couple miles after that, and then something really weird happened. It was almost as if someone blew a lot of glowing smoke directly from above onto our car. And then we heard a large ""WHOMP"" sound, and then the smoke disappeared, and the tires on our car made a ""rrr"" sound, almost like they would if the wheels were spinning freely and then hit the pavement. Everyone kind of looked at each other with a ""did that really just happen"" look on their faces, and then we just shrugged it off.

About 5 minutes later, we passed another exit. It was the SAME EXIT we had passed before, with the dim Texaco light and everything. We all did a double take, and then my friend pulled out a map to check if there were any exits close to where we were. Only that one within 40 miles. Something transported our car back 5 miles. All of us in the car saw it happen, except the one that was asleep who still thinks we're trying to fuck with him.

TL;DR: Drove past an exit, saw a strange light and heard a strange noise, and drove past the SAME EXIT AGAIN without switching directions.

A few days ago, I was sitting in my typical psychology class. I sat in my seat beside my ""friend,"" someone I basically only associate with so she can bitch about social problems. We're sitting there, listening to the professor lecture about Freud. She's half-asleep in her seat, and I'm watching the Professor's hand scrawl a few notes on the board, my chin resting on my arms.

The professor writes two lines, and as he's doing this, my friend jerks up and says, ""Do you see that?"" As the professor starts the third line, I look over at her, and there's a loud bang, like a metal bat hitting a metal pole. There's a black ""flash,"" and my chin is resting on my arms again, and the professor's hand is back, the two lines gone, and he's writing the same thing over again. As, he starts the second, I look at my friend. She jumps, and says, ""Do you see that?"" Just like the first time. 

She looks at me with a confused look, and I look around the room to see everyone sitting straight up, some even standing, all with nervous looks. The professor is looking back-and-forth between his hand and the board. He looks around that class, as if to say, ""What the fuck?"" and there's another bang. He's writing the two lines again, everyone's sitting back down, half-asleep. My friend says, ""Do you see that?"" 

I remember asking her, ""See what?"" She just looked at me, confused, and said, ""What are you talking about?""

It may sound like a ghost story first (sorry, but that's how it happened). The glitch comes at the end.

I was in my early twenties, the year must have been 1987 or '88, because I only lived in that part of town during these years. There was a pub with cool rock concerts near our place, a 15 minute walk. The quickest way was through a park, not a big one, but it was an experimental thing to keep it in its natural state (grass was not mowed, trees were not trimmed - they just kept the gravel road clean for walking). It felt a little bit like wilderness, in a good way. But not too remote, you could hear cars from the nearby streets and other city sounds all the time. Me and my friends had been through this park countless times, to the pub and back, alone or in groups. It was totally cool every time, well until that evening.

We were 3 people that night, my best friend who was also my roommate, another student visiting from our old hometown and I. We had been to one of the concerts, a local blues band, great music. We were not drunk or anything, because after paying the entrance fee, the money we had only allowed one beer for each of us.

About halfway through the park, I felt something strange, an urge to get out of there. I noticed my friends also stopped chatting while I was trying to pinpoint the feeling. But there was nothing unusual in sight or sound around us. Still, the feeling kept growing. Told myself not to be stupid, but I was almost panicking. I noticed myself walking faster, the others did the same. My hand unconsciously reached out for the hand of my friend and met her hand halfway. ""You feel it too?"" she whispered. ""Let's get out of here!"" I said, and we broke into a run, almost racing each other, until we could see our house. The feeling of doom was suddenly gone for me, and I could tell by the nervous jokes of the others that they felt as embarassed about the whole thing as I did. We were already rationalising it away as too little sleep and too much stress when I opened the door to the apartment.

We had a huge wall clock in the hall, and I stopped breathing when I looked at it. We checked our watches, but they matched the clock. It had been a little over 2 hours since we left the pub. A walk that takes 15 minutes in a normal pace had taken us over 2 hours, although we ran almost half of the way. 

We tried to find an explanation, but couldn't think of anything that made any sense. Some more nervous jokes, and we went to our separate rooms. 

Next morning at breakfast, I asked the others what they thought we had experienced. My roommate said in a very serious voice ""It didn't happen!"", and I asked ""What?"", and she yelled at me (which was very out of character for her) ""It did not happen! Forget it!

When we found the maze: http://imgur.com/rTkE7yK 
When we returned: http://imgur.com/Ja0cLI1**

(The following story is completely and utterly true. Just felt I should point that out, as it seems unbelievable even to myself, and I experienced it.)

I'm British and have lived in the USA for about 5 years. My family moved due to my father's work, and all our family still live back home in the UK. We go back and visit each year, and upon one of these visits about a year ago we went to a theme park. I don't remember the name, as I wasn't all that interested in going in the first place.

It was dull, childish, and raining. I was bored and had no interest in any of the rides and therefore had nothing to do. My younger sister and I wandered off on our own, I was 15 and she was 12 at the time. We were walking along one of the pathways through the theme park and there was no one around, there were very few people there that day, I assume due to the weather.

We came across one of the usual signs for the rides, large and to the side of the pathway, with all the warnings against riding if pregnant, have a heart condition, etc. I can't for the life of me remember what the ride was called, but the sign was older than the others, and branches had grown over it and made it harder to notice. It did however inform us that the ride was in fact a maze. The entrance to the maze was hard to find also, despite the sign. It was a doorway of black wood coming out of the side of what looked like a mound of earth covered in foliage and trees.

Upon going in, we realised that the maze had to be older than most of the other attractions, due to the bad lighting, and crappy decor. It was meant to be some sort of horror fun house, with trick mirrors that reveal a face that isn't yours if you get close enough, and low ceilings to make you crouch and in some parts crawl.

The whole point of the maze was to find your way to one of two slides and get out, and once we had reached the largest room we'd encountered so far, I was sure we'd be out soon. I felt awfully nervous in that place, and I'm not usually one to freak out over dim lighting and shitty, home made Halloween decorations. But something just made both of us feel really uncomfortable, and we both wanted to get out as soon as possible. We made our way through the largest room, that was rather disturbingly decorated with false severed body parts and jarred ""organs"". I remember thinking that it was a little much for a kiddie theme park.

We came across what we believed to be the way out: a giant badly sculpted monster, into which's mouth we were expected to crawl. I really did NOT want to go first. I don't know why, but I just dreaded the darkness on the other side of that thing. However, my little sister insisted, more obviously afraid than I. It was as cramped and dark as I had expected when I got through, though at least I could stand up. Immediately after the monster, we had to climb some stairs and found ourselves in a weird little plastic room, wet with rain that had leaked in. Sure enough, one of the slide entrances was there, and thanks to my usual luck, it was boarded up.

My sister and I practically chased one another back down the pitch black staircase and back out the monster's mouth. There was only one more direction to try and we eventually found our way out the other slide. The exit was as nondescript as the entrance, hidden away and over grown.

She and I made our way back to my families chosen meeting point, pretty freaked out yet unsure why exactly. At the time it just seemed like a creepy maze, no big deal really. Until my mother asked where we'd been and what we'd been on. She gave us the theme park map to show her, and we couldn't find the ride. The theme park wasn't very big, and so this map showed the location of literally everything. Although a little creeped out, it again didn't seem like a big deal. The maze was older, maybe the map had be updated. We weren't far away, and my youngest sister wanted to head that way anyway, so we decided to show my mum the maze.

We we definitely back where the ride was, my sister and I were both completely sure of it. But the sign wasn't there, and upon closer inspection, neither was the entrance. We ran down the pathway, trying to find the exit, but it wasn't there either. Everything else was exactly as it had been, but the ride and every trace of it was gone.

Neither of us have an explanation, and both of us remember the same thing. I know this wasn't a dream, as my entire family remember the day out, and my sister and I going off for that amount of time. I've always been able to see/sense things of a supernatural nature, but never to that extent and never has someone else experienced it all with me in the exact same way, and remembered all the exact same things.",,False,,t5_2tcwa,1361080574.0,,,True,t3_18nj8j,http://www.reddit.com/r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix/comments/18nj8j/expost_from_rthetruthishere_the_ride_that_wasnt/,

Alright so this happened a couple of weeks ago to me and my brother. We go to our Dad's every other week, it involves taking a bus from our house to the local train station, then a train to the main city, before taking another train to the city he lives in. When we go we take stuff we'll need, headset, webcam, laptop etc. My brother is very forgetful and we were in a rush. We get on the bus to head up to the bus station, and he realizes he left his laptop. He gets off and runs down. I continue to the station and wait for him while he gets back. 

Now to make the train to the city our Dad lives there are three trains. When I arrive the first train is leaving, since my brother is not here I wait for him. Ask him what's going on etc. An old lady found his laptop and a stranger gave him money for the bus. Luckily, he arrives just before the next train arrives. Now on the train we set down our phones and discuss matters of transport.

Then I get a message ""Lewis (my brother) [current time] ""when's the next train? I think i missed you"". I thought this was a joke from him, so  I give him the look of 'seriously you think you can trick me with that?'. He looks confused so I showed him the message and his face just drops. He told me he never sent anything like that, since his phone was on the table of the train he couldn't have without me seeing. Just to make sure I read the messages from me to him. I assumed it was an old message and just now sent, however there was nothing. He didn't have anything to hide anyway.

I send a response, but it only goes to his phone, which 
was disappointing.  I theorize that it was an alternative reality where he missed the train and I got on it. ",,False,,t5_2tcwa,False,,,True,t3_qpqyd,http://www.reddit.com/r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix/comments/qpqyd/a_text_from_alternate_reality/,

I work in a big office building for a small company. There's a phone sitting on my desk that's only connected to the reception phones, so the receptionists can notify us of visitors and packages. It is connected to nothing else at all, there's no way to access it from the world outside this building.  

It rang at around 2pm one day, and normally, the little LCD display it lists 'reception' followed by the ID of the reception phone that's calling in. This time, it said nothing at all. The LCD was blank. I thought, well, perhaps it's kicked it, it is pretty old. 

I picked it up and greeted the caller. ""Good afternoon, [redacted].""

The caller was elderly but somewhat brisk-sounding; she was asking for a man that used to work here before he passed away several years ago. 

""I'm sorry, ma'am, [redacted] no longer works here. May I ask who's calling?""

""Do you know how I might get hold of him?"" 

""I'm afraid [redacted] passed away quite a while ago. Who's calling, please?""

""Don't be absurd.""

""I'm sorry?""

""But I saw him scarcely a week ago. I was calling to wish him a happy birthday."" 

By this point I was confused as hell and more than a bit frightened.  Neither his first or surname were very common at all.

""I don't know how I can help you, ma'am."" 

Cue a shitload of white noise for about ten seconds. 

""Oh, all right, then. I guess I'll just have to wait until I see him next. He's fifty-one today, you know. Thanks for your help, miss."" 

The line cut off. Out of horribly morbid curiosity, I pulled up his employee profile. As I thought, his date of birth was nowhere near today's date, but I did a mental calculation and confirmed that, had he still been alive, he would have turned fifty-one some months ago. 

Then something else caught my eye. His status was listed as deceased, as you'd expect, and right below that was the date he died. 

It was today's date. 

I went down to reception and asked if they'd had any trouble with the phones in what I'd hoped was a nonchalant manner. The lady wrinkled her nose and confirmed, yes, the internal communication had been acting up for approximately two minutes, no one had been able to make any outgoing calls, but the phone had rung in that time. They let me listen to the recording. 

They'd picked up and greeted them, asking what company they were after. No reply. About ten seconds of silence. 

Very, very faint, crackly singing, overlaid by interference and static.

And I am also not sure if this belongs here or on r/conspiracy, but here it goes... 

I went to undergrad at the George Washington University. On 9/11 our dorms were evacuated due to the proximity of the State Department, which was car bombed. I remember leaving my dorm after watching a plane hit the towers on the Today show, in a panic because I am from the New York Area. 

I grabbed a couple of my friends and we headed out to see what was going on as there were a lot of sirens in the area. We started walking through campus toward the metro, and there were legions of people walking up 21st street. There was smoke billowing up from one of the buildings at the state department. When I asked someone what was going on, she said that there was a car bombing at the state department and everyone was evacuated. 

Fast forward a couple of weeks later, we took a walk to the state department and sure enough the building facade closest to E street was severely damaged. But there were no news reports of anything that happened. 

TO this day people call me crazy when I tell them this story, because there is no evidence anywhere to support it.  Five people could not have imagined the same scenario, could they?

We spent the weekend making up adventures for SuperDan, discussing his super powers, and generally being idiots.
 On the drive home SuperDan was in one car with his brother Chris and Aris and I were in the car behind still chatting about SuperDan. At one stage one of us wondered if SuperDan was using his telepathic powers to listen to our conversation. At the same time we both said jokingly ""SuperDan can you here us?"". At that exact moment Dan lowered his window, leaned out, looked back, smiled and nodded.

This began last night. My boyfriend and I keep our bedroom door shut, to keep the cats out. The only lights I leave on at night are the porch light downstairs, and the stove light in the kitchen downstairs. I woke up during the night, and the hallway light was on, but the door was shut. I woke up again later, and the door was slightly ajar and the hallway light was still on. This morning, the door was shut, and I had to turn the hallway light off. I asked my boyfriend if he got up during the night, but he said no. Okay, no big deal, maybe he just doesn't remember.

Then I went downstairs to feed the cats. Something had spilled in the fridge, so I cleaned that up and threw the paper towels away. There was nothing else on the floor around the trash can. I turned around to make some coffee. I kept turning around because I heard extremely loud dripping sounds behind me. Even though the sounds were coming from the center of the room, I thought maybe the stuff in the fridge had spilled again (or maybe I missed some of the mess), and I opened and closed the fridge door twice, trying to find the dripping. I knelt down and checked the very bottom of the fridge. Nothing was spilled anywhere. When I turned back around, my cat was playing with toilet paper, and there was toilet paper all over the floor that had not been there a few minutes before. My trash can has a lid, so the cat could not have pulled that out. Not only that, but I use toilet paper folded into little squares to put toner on my face after I wash it - this is what the cat was playing with, but I only wash my face in the upstairs bathroom, far away from the kitchen. The trash can upstairs also has a lid, and besides - my cat had been in the kitchen with me all morning.

When I bent down to pick up all the scraps off the floor, I saw my boyfriend walk down the hall and down the basement stairs. The cat saw him, too. But we have really creaky stairs, and I was amazed by how quiet he was, because he is a really big dude. I was planning on telling him his cat was being an asshole once he got back from the basement - but then I heard him walking around *upstairs*, and he came down into the kitchen... he hadn't ever gone into the basement.

Meanwhile, I was feeling so lightheaded all morning, that I was growing concerned that I was going to pass out. When I walked out to my car, the passenger side window was rolled half-way down. I never leave my windows down, because I live in a really crappy neighborhood. It rained overnight (one of the times that I looked at the bedroom door overnight, it was because the storm woke me up), so everything outside was wet, and I was concerned that my passenger seat would be soaked. *Nothing in my car was wet.* My cd cases were sitting on the passenger seat, and both the cases and the seat were bone dry.

So then, on my drive to work, I got stuck in traffic. It was stop-and-go, and I was getting frustrated because the truck in front of me was pulling a big, metal trailer with really dim brake lights - and he was going sooo slow. The trailer was full of trash, and in spray paint it said, ""STAY BACK 15 FEET"" across the back, in really poor handwriting. I was relieved when the truck &amp; trailer got off at the next exit - which I should mention is a left exit that dumps out onto a trafficway that travels away from the highway (not parallel, nor do they intersect again) I finally sped up, and started to pass the slower drivers on the road. Lo and behold, about 5 miles down the road... I passed the same damn truck. Same crappy handwriting across the back, same piles of trash. There was absolutely no physical way for him to have gotten back on the highway and gotten in front of me.

I got so lightheaded and confused on my way to work, that I didn't feel like I was truly awake.

1375810661.0,137,self.Glitch_in_the_Matrix,1jtoac,Just found out about this subreddit! Here's one of my many glitches. The one that freaked me out the most.,158,21,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix/comments/1jtoac/just_found_out_about_this_subreddit_heres_one_of/,"I'll try to make this a short read.

One night, about a year ago, my friend and I were riding our bikes across town, just for fun.

Now, a little background:
We've lived in this town for years, and though I'm not so great with direction, my friend certainly is. Furthermore, this town is near impossible to get lost in. It's set up like a giant grid. (streets labeled with numbers and direction, i.e.  NW 8th st., SE 15th ave et cetera) So even if you had no natural sense of direction whatsoever, you could get around town just by paying attention to the signs.

We had been biking in one direction for a while, and we decided to take a parallel backroad to get to our destination. As we're riding, we come across a cow pasture and stop to talk to the cows. (they were brahmas so they looked pretty funny and also lonely.)

Well, we continue riding and as we look around, things look as though they hadn't before. I can't describe it, but this uneasy feeling came over me as my friend started to mention how we seem to have gone a wrong way- which he had never said before in this town. 

After quite a time of riding back in the direction of home (we were CERTAIN we were going the right way based on the signs) we come to a main road, but things were a little off....We then realized that we were back in the EXACT location we had been in about 30 minutes earlier, despite us traveling in one direction the OPPOSITE way. It was as though some giant hand (I picture the one from Ocarina of Time) Picked us up and dropped us back off at the location where we turned around. 

When we arrived back home we both felt extremely perplexed and uneasy. I realize we could have just been confused, but I'm not so certain that was the case...We were looking at the signs, and had been in the area many times before. We looked at a map online and it was still confusing as to how we got lost. We were both a little miffed, but it made for a great adventure!

As an interesting side note, the same thing happened to my dad when he was my age, but he was in a car with some buddies. They knew the area well and somehow ended up BACK where they were about 15-20 minutes earlier....He said he'd never been so freaked out in his life, and my dad's a difficult person to freak out.

Anyway, It's not as 'strange' as some stories, but to be entirely misplaced in a town you're very familiar with was unnerving to say the least.

When I was 9 years old, I had an experience that still makes me scratch my head and gives me goosebumps to this day.  I was at home with my brother who is 3 years older than me.  We lived in a two story house with the top level being the living area and the bottom being more of a den and playroom.  I was downstairs and my brother was upstairs.  Not doing much of anything and feeling bored, I called my brother downstairs to play some Nintendo with me.  I decided to hide around the corner from the stairs and jump out to scare him as he came down.  It seems he had the same thought to scare me because he was creeping downstairs to the same corner.  Each of us hearing the other sneaking to the corner, we leaped out at the same time and screamed to give the other a good scare.  As I did this, I looked at my brother's face only to see MY own face staring back at me.  As if I were looking in a mirror.  But there was no mirror.  And it was still my brother's body, head, hair, etc., but with my face.  I started screaming for real and ran as fast as I could back into the den.  Then I heard my brother screaming bloody murder and running back upstairs.   I just figured my screaming had really startled him.  However, talking to him later, he tells me that when he jumped around the corner to scare me he saw HIS face on my head.  I hadn't told him about my experience at this time, and he was describing the exact same thing that happened to me.  That made it seem even creepier and real to me.  It was as if we switched faces temporarily.  It's honestly the weirdest thing that has ever happened to me and I believe it was a definite glitch in the Matrix.

EDIT:  I actually didn't mention this before (I now realize it would help clear up some things) but my brother wears glasses and I don't.  When I saw my face on his, there were no glasses.

Not quite sure, but definitely weird and unsettling either way.

As a young gal interested in anime and Japanese culture, I joined a chatroom on deviantart for hentai because I, stupidly at the time, thought it was the Japanese word for anime. I met someone there and we became fast friends and soon switched to talking on msn instead of on deviantart.

Then things got kind of weird. First, this friend, who I'll call...S, for ease of reading, told me I had beautifully reddish brown hair. I did not have, at the time, a picture of me online to show my hair color, but S was right. S also correctly guessed my eye color.

Then S claimed to be into something like astral projection and claimed to be standing behind me. I called bullshit until S accurately described my room to a t. I thought it could be a friend fucking with me, but at the time I was interested in the paranormal and thought it was cool so I continued talking to S.

Then S claimed he could touch me, and tried to. Now, this one I am chalking up to confirmation bias, but I could genuinely feel S stroking my hair or my face or whereever.

So, at this point I was fairly creeped out and decided that I wanted to 'test' S. In my internal monologue and not out loud at all, I let out a blood curdling scream. I did not tell S I was doing this at all. I did not let the scream out of my mouth where people could hear it. I just 'thought' the scream.

Without missing a beat, the next IM I got from S was something along the lines of ""Why did you scream at me like that?""

I was young and I freaked the fuck out and stopped talking to S.

It was brass, about 8"" in diameter, and etched with Egyptian hieroglyphs.  He wondered if it had religious significance, like those little scroll cases Jewish people hang in their doorways.  I am not religious, nor Egyptian, so I understood his curiosity.  It is a strange thing to hang above your door.  

What is even stranger, is that I had no idea where it came from.  I knew it was mine, and I knew it was important.  It felt like something I had owned since childhood, even though it only recently appeared.  I simply had no memory of where it came from, or why it was hung above the door.  I certainly did not buy it.  I certainly did not hang it.  

Keep in mind I was completely sober my entire freshman year of college.  If this was later in my life, I could imagine myself drunkenly stealing something like this from a bar late at night, thinking I was clever, then forgetting about the whole drunken night.  I just did not drink, do any drugs, or go to any bars freshman year.  As a broke college student, I didn't have any money to be spending on strange Egyptian wall hangings.

It is hard to describe the feeling.  It was mine, and I placed it above the door.   I just had no specific memories about it.  Where the hell did I get it?   Did someone give it to me?  I knew I hung it, but I could not remember how.  We were in the dorms, so this would have been a memorable project.  Where did I get the nail?  Did I slide a chair over to stand on?  Did I hammer the nail with my shoe?  Or a book?  I could not remember any specifics, even soon after it appeared.  It bothered me for the rest of the year.

To this day, I have it hanging above my front door.  It has been guarding the door of every house I have lived in, even though it always looks out of place.  I never look at it.  It gives me a creepy feeling anytime I think about it.  I asked my brother about it once, and he said it looked familiar.  He thinks he remembers it from when we were children, but can not place the memory.  This is the same feeling I have about it.  My mother claims she has never seen it before.  My wife remembers when I first brought it home from college, and accepts it as one of my quirks.

Looking back on it now, it is easy to dismiss as a case of faulty memory.  It only scares me when I think back to the day it first, mysteriously, appeared.  When someone asks me about it now, my answer is the same as it was that first day.  It is mine.  It is very important.  I have no idea where it came from.

Anyway so  I'm laying in our bed dozing off one afternoon and I had this really strange dream. In it I was living in Seattle (I have family there and grew up there so thats not weird) with my husband. But it wasn't my fiancé. It was some French man. In the dream he asks me to check the freezer to see if we have any Hot Pockets left. I get up and walk into our kitchen and lo' there are no more Hot Pockets. Then I wake up. I remember that moment vividly because I thought, ""Seattle? French husband? That's random"".

I was unnerved because of how the dream felt. It was so random and realistic. But I dismiss it and carry on with wedding plans. 

Well things fell apart for a myriad of reasons.  I move back to Seattle, settle back into life with my some family and get a job...blah blah. 

2 years later I meet a French man. We date a while. We get married.  But the dream still hasn't occurred to me. Until one evening, when he asked if we had any Hot Pockets left. It was then, standing in front of my freezer holding the empty cardboard box that the dream came back to me. 

I almost felt like I was back in my old apartment in Marrakech. I could smell it, feel the blanket (it was the best blanket, so soft), see the photos hanging on the wall. exactly the scene I woke up to. 

I was freaked out but said nothing to my husband. Just excused myself and went to bed to ""read"".

Then suddenly I was alone.,145,18,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix/comments/1jpw5p/i_was_home_with_my_mom_and_brother_then_suddenly/,"Just started reading some of these and it's got me fascinated.  Especially considering what happened to me once years ago.  I've had the usual ""items disappearing and reappearing"" kind of thing happen a lot.  Even once today even.  But this was from a long time ago, and was a little bigger in scale.  

I was somewhere between 9 and 12 at the time, and I was hanging around in the living room of our house watching tv.  My brother was in our bedroom playing and my mom was shuttling back and forth from bedroom to basement doing laundry.  

For whatever reason I decided to go find my mom.  I could have sworn the last place I saw her go was her bedroom, but when I got there it was empty.  Huh, I must have missed her go downstairs again.  So I ran to the top of the stairs and shouted down.  No response.  Ok, that's weird.

So I started over.  I checked her bedroom again, bathroom was open and empty, my room was empty even though I swore my brother was in there a little while ago.  The living room, dining room, and kitchen were the only other rooms in our one floor (plus basement) house, and together they formed the only path from the bedrooms to the basement.  I felt the panic building as I raced through empty rooms to the basement door.  

I was scared, but I still raced down the stairs.  I turned the corner to look in the laundry room, where I truly expected my mom to be, but I was greeted by a washer and dryer and nothing more.  I turned to the rest of the dark silent basement, and scanned over it.  Nothing to be seen.  So I raced back upstairs.

I thought to myself, maybe they both went outside for some reason.  Yeah.  That's the only thing that would make sense at this point.  So I stepped out the back door and ran all around the outside of the house looking everywhere I could think of, but I didn't see anyone.  My mom's car was still there, so what the heck is going on?

I walked back inside thinking I'd probably do another sweep of the house and maybe just wait for a while if that turned up nothing.  I turned the corner into the kitchen and almost ran right into my mom carrying a big basket of laundry.  I must have been breathing heavily and staring wide-eyed at her when I asked.

""Where were you?  I looked everywhere.""

""I was just doing laundry""

""But I looked everywhere and you weren't here""

""I don't know what to tell you honey.  I've just been in the bedroom and downstairs""

Yeah, those were the two places I scoured the hardest, and there's no other place in between that I didn't look.  

I checked my bedroom right after this conversation and there was my brother too, right where I remember him being.

At the time I was afraid they just ceased to exist or something, but now I wonder if I just stepped outside of our reality for 10 minutes or so.

Just stumbled across this place, thought I'd share a story my friends have always referred to as a glitch in the matrix. 

It's a sunday afternoon, my friend and I are drinking beers on the driveway, people watching, etc. My buddy is smoking a cigarette and a guy walking past us asks if he can bum a smoke. My friend obliges, and we invite him to have a seat with us. I end up grabbing him a beer and we get into a nice conversation for about an hour or so. He tells us his name is Dizzy and he's just moved in with his mom across the street to be closer to his girlfriend, who apparently had just lost her father. I don't know my neighbors very well, didn't think anything of it at the time, but he mentioned his mom's name was Rhonda. It's worth mentioning here that our new friend is black. Dizzy also tells us he's a musician, and that he has a drumset. Eventually an older black woman parks in the driveway across the street, and Dizzy says it's his mom and he thanks us for the chat and goes inside. We heard him playing the drums for about an hour.

Next weekend its my birthday, I go across the street to let Dizzy know. The door is open, with the screen door closed. I ring the doorbell, no answer, just a cat sitting on the stairs. Ring one more time, nothing. I start to walk away but as I turn towards the driveway I notice an old white dude standing in the door frame staring at me. I asked him if Dizzy was home, and he tells me no one by that name lives there. I asked him if Rohnda lived there, he said no. Asked him if he had a drum set, again, no. I'd seen this guy before, he's been my neighbor for a while, but I just assumed he had moved out when Dizzy's mom moved in.

If the dejavu is negative, I take it as a warning to change the events. When I change the events, the bad conclusion disappears and the memory goes all fuzzy, but when I don't change it fast enough, I feel like i'm living the negative twice and it sucks that much more.

Time A) 8 years old, walking to school with my mum. My shoelace comes undone, and my mum tells me to stop and fix it. I get a sort of flash memory of bending down to fix my shoe and then everything goes black, so i ignored her and walked a few meters before she said it again and I stopped. As I was bending down, a car was roaring down the road and crashed into an electricity pole maybe 15 feet away from us. The front left car tire flew off from the impact, straight at where my head would have been if I stopped there.

Time B) Walking from one place to another whilst drunk with a friend. It was much faster to get home if we walked along the train tracks, so we did just that. In the middle of the trek, the train tracks change from a flat land track to a brisge that spans approx 250 meters. We start walking across, and around 1/3 of the way my Dejavu kicks in, sort of like I am asleep whilst awake and dreaming while my body still walks, and all I see is myself ahead on the tracks another 50 meters and walking, and realising a light is getting closer, I turn around and my friend shouts out as we get hit by a train mid bridge. I wake up from the dejavu and look behind me, no light, but I tell my friend to start running across, which he thinks is weird but doesn't really question it because he is always paranoid. I'm ahead of my dejavu by approx 50 meters, and the light starts to creep up, but by this point I can tell we will barely make it to safety. Long story short, my friend was faster and got away from the train with easy, I hit land and dived from the track, the train clipped my foot and spun me around in midair, but i landed sliding down a hill so it wasn't so bad. My foot was bruised severely, but nothing was broken and I'm still here and breathing.

This is not a ghost story. 

At my job we had one partner with us on every shift. This night I was working with Jessica. We were doing the 'swing shift' - 3pm - 11pm. I was in the kitchen cleaning up the grill after dinner and I see Jessica cleaning the tables in the dining room about five feet from me. I ask her if she wants to put another pot of coffee on or if we still have enough from after serving the residents. She doesn't respond, which is unusual because we weren't having a bad night or fighting or anything. I ask again and don't see her in there anymore. 

So five minutes later, Jessica comes down from a hallway and I say, ""Hey, wait, where were you?"" She says she was helping Helen to bed. (This is a common task for the time of night and takes about twenty minutes because she has severe dementia.) I say, ""That's crazy! I swear I saw you in the dining room while I was cleaning the kitchen... but it couldn't have been you actually. The person I saw was wearing a pink sweatshirt and sweatpants."" As Jessica is standing in front of me, I can see she's wearing a black top and blue jeans. She turned slightly pale and her mouth dropped open. Finally she says, ""That's what I was wearing last night. This lady from across the street gave us three bags of clothes she didn't want anymore and I picked out the pink sweatsuit and put it on last night to see if it would fit. Then I kept it on for the rest of the night."" 

So the tale stops here, because I'm pretty freaked out over this. The kind of thing hasn't ever happened to me before in such an obvious way. First of all, let me say I live 20 minutes drive out of town and I only worked there on weekends. I was not even in town the night before when Jessica was on shift. Also, that outfit she got was new (to her, anyhow) so I wasn't using a remembered image of her if my eyes had played a trick on me. I had known Jessica for about three years by that point and she wasn't one to lie or weave stories for amusement.

As she went to put her purse down, the button that held the purse strap together broke off and rolled under my desk.  This was her favorite purse, so she was mildly upset that it had broken, but I figured we'd find the button, have it repaired, and everything would be fine.  Only, we never found the button.  It was a big, brown button about an inch in diameter.  I'm a pretty neat person, so there was no clutter under the desk or anything.  We spent an hour moving furniture, tearing the room apart, and could not find the button.  Eventually we gave up.  I figured I'd find it when I moved out, but I didn't, even though I was looking for it.

Fast forward about two years, we've moved across the country.  Girlfriend still has the purse since she likes it, and has been meaning to just get a replacement button and have it fixed, but we're busy graduate students and we've never gotten around to it.  The purse is hanging by the door in our new apartment with her other purses and our coats and stuff.  Anyways, we decide to take a day trip to a little historic village about an hour away from our place.  It's probably early October, and a bit chilly.  Once we get there, I realize that I'm not dressed for the weather, but I figure I can manage.  But then one of the shops we are in just happens to have a sale on fleece zip up jackets that are actually pretty nice, so I buy one--I needed a new one anyways.  I put it on and walk around in it for the rest of the day.  When we get home that night, I nonchalantly put my hands in the pockets of the fleece, and what do I find?  Of course: the exact button that had gone missing two years ago.  Or at least one just like it.  It was a perfect match for the purse.  

My girlfriend was pissed because she thought I had been master trolling her for two years about the button, and had decided that now would be a good time to randomly find it.  She still doesn't believe that I really did find it then and there in the new jacket.  

My mom used to say, jokingly, when I was a kid and couldn't find a toy or something, that a gnome had borrowed it and I would find it when they were done using it.

I'm about to describe what happened that January- Joshy died that February. In my high-school english class we had to write in this creative journal for 10 minutes at the beginning of each period, like a free write. Honestly, it was my favorite part of the class- I loved and continue to love writing, so it was awesome for me to actually sit down at the beginning of each period and clear my mind. I wrote a 10 page story called the Pond. A lot of poetry. Wherever my mind wandered. And in late January, I wrote a short story about a young man who had just set his house on fire. It never explicitly said what he had done, but he was sitting outside the flames of his burning house in his pajama's asking what he had done as sirens came closer and closer. It's almost an uncanny parallel to what actually happened that night- the half brother killed the family, set the house on fire, and went back to his apartment where the police found him in with knifecuts all over his hands, in pajamas. It's weird. It's disturbing. I don't like it at all. It could be a coincidence... I hope it is.

Instead of going to our sister-in-law's page, I was taken to some message page where I was seeing a message from my sister coming up in real-time.  It wasn't chat or anything.  And she was going on about how her husband is possessed, and she is going to be killed for her beliefs, and not to fear the death of the body.

Last I heard (in the most roundabout way, not from either him or her), he took her to the hospital while her husband was sleeping.  Not believing it until I hear from him.

**TL;DR** Glitch in the matrix led me to what looked an awful lot like a suicide note coming up in real-time.  I hope I did the right thing.

Edit:  She has had some issues with her mental stability in the past -- I'm fairly sure it's bipolar disorder.  A likely explanation doesn't make it any less terrifying, though.

Edit 2: Frontpage?  Really?

About 3:00 PM, I talked to our dad.  He took her to the hospital, which I hadn't really doubted, but it was good to hear it from him.  He didn't call sooner because he wasn't allowed to take his phone in with him.  He said that on the way there, she was spouting the same stuff she'd been saying to me, to our mom, and apparently to her husband.  And she tried to run away from him in the parking garage because he'd said he wasn't sure how to get to the hospital from there (it isn't attached), so I guess that sent up red flags that he couldn't be trusted after all.  Eventually she must have calmed down.  She signed herself in, so at least she was stable enough to do that.  Now I suppose we just hope she's getting help and wait patiently for news.  I'm still scared.",,False,,t5_2tcwa,True,,,True,t3_osyq1,http://www.reddit.com/r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix/comments/osyq1/well_played_facebook_that_is_more_important_than/,

I always had to cross the street to get to the bus and most of the time I walked to the crosswalk.

It was a cold icy February morning and I was running late for the bus because I had to put on an extra layer of clothing. I looked out the window and could see the bus coming up to my stop.

I ran out of the house and crossed the street forgetting to look both ways before crossing. I looked to my right to see the bus but remembered to check my left... just as a silver Toyota was an inch from slamming into me. The expression on the girls face was of pure horror as we both realized I made a fatal mistake. I close my eyes knowing the inevitable only to find myself standing at the bus stop, I open my eyes to see the silver Toyota skid and spin out down the street. The woman gets out of her car and looks around in a panic.

The bus pulls up and opens her door, the bus driver is shocked as I get on the bus. ""I just saw you get hit..."" her voice cracks a bit as if she actually saw me get hit and fly off the car or something. 

I was so grateful that I didn't die, I just gave my bus money and sat down and tried hard to think about what the heck just happened.",,False,,t5_2tcwa,False,,,True,t3_1i9d45,http://www.reddit.com/r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix/comments/1i9d45/teleportation_some_of_my_earliest_remembered/,

I asked if he wanted to go on a walk with me because I was feeling too stuffy in the house with no A/C. It was getting close to sunset, the sky was still blue but all the buildings had a yellow haze over them. I had brought my camera with me to take pictures along the way. 

Well, the walk started off pretty normal, we had just moved in to this place in a new town and so we were exploring and ended up finding the path. About 5 minutes into the path I started feeling really washed out and almost dizzy. I looked around and noticed that nothing looked very real. It was the strangest sensation I have ever had, and I had no idea what was going on. It felt as if I was in a super lucid dream but was not able to wake up. Really it just felt like I did not exist and nothing else existed. It's so weird to think about and very difficult to explain. 
I was so weirded out by this that I asked my boyfriend if I was dreaming, he said no. I asked him if we were in reality and he said yes. I wasn't satisfied with his answer and tried explaining to him how I was feeling. I think he got a little annoyed with it which didn't help me much.

We continued on our walk for another 20 minutes. The feeling never went away. I tried to focus on the scenery around me to see if anything was unrealistic. Everything was in the right place, I could make out each individual tree in the park and stone on the ground. But still I felt that nothing around me existed. I had no idea what to think or do. 

Eventually we got home and I had to lie down and relax. I ended up forgetting about it after I slept for a little while. Still, it was the weirdest feeling I have ever experienced and I still think about it all the time.

Does anybody have an explanation for these feelings? I have small a history of high stress and anxiety but that's about it.

It happened last year. It was a week day and I drove to my physio appointment in the morning in my '01 Camry. My appointment finished an hour later and I drive home. On the way home however, I'm going just over the speed limit, and at the last second I see a speed camera on the side of the road. It flashes, and I shout out some expletives to myself. I just get homea few minutes later, park the car in my garage and go inside. My girlfriend is inside, watching cable in bed and had only just woken up 2 minutes prior to my arrival. Everything is normal.

Skip ahead 3 weeks.

I open up the mailbox, there's the usual junk: newspapers; real estate ad pamphlet; and, two envelopes from the department of transport. I was expecting one, but not two. I open up the first one, it's a speeding fine, $75, 9km/h over the speed limit, day and date, etc. Except, the image that the camera took, is clearly a picture of my girlfriend driving my car. However, my Girlfriend only has an Automatic license, and not a manual, and she has never driven my car before. My car is manual, so at first I thought it was strange, but figured maybe she just went on a quick errand. 

I open up the other envelope, and it's another speeding fine. Only this time, I look at the picture, it's me, in my car, yep everything checks out. I look at the details - $75, 9km/h over the speed limit. However, I look at the date, and it's the same date as the one on my girlfriends speeding fine. I look at the time, and my fine is timed 24 seconds before when hers was taken. I double checked the times, got her to double check the times and details. I reference the date and time with her diary, and confirm the fine is after my physio when I was driving home. All the details were the same, license plate, date, fine, speed - except for the image of the driver, and the time.

She says she has never driven my car before in the 2 years we have known each other, which I believe as she isn't the rebellious type and she has her own car. I ended up going to the police station to dispute it, as it is clearly the same car, and it must've been some issue with the camera, but I had no case. I just ended up paying for both fines and continuing on with my life. To this day, I don't know what happened. My girlfriend was at home waiting for me on the day I was caught by the camera speeding. There is a 0% chance that it was her driving my car. All the evidence proves it though, that she somehow drove my car, and went passed the same speed camera, on the same day, 24 seconds after I did, doing the same speed, all while I was still driving home in my car.

**tl;dr: I got a speeding fine. Girlfriend got the same speeding fine, in the same car,  on the same day, at the same speed, in the same location, 24 seconds after I did, while she was at home watching the Kardashians.**


EDIT: You guys convinced me! I'm going to give the post office/my local police station a visit this week to see if I can get a copy of it. I will see if i can get a refund through court as it must've been a glitch with the camera and not with the matrix.",,False,,t5_2tcwa,1373510183.0,,,True,t3_1i0bm0,http://www.reddit.com/r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix/comments/1i0bm0/speeding_fine_glitch/,

My brother and I are avid golfers and took a day-trip to a golf course 45 minutes away to another town. On the way home there is a town (5 minutes out from our city) with a new development and a golf course that was slated to open last season but was delayed for a year to establish the seed more thoroughly. 

I piped up and said ""let's go check out the new course and see what it looks like."" So we meander through some unfamiliar new suburbish type crescents (as they are called in our parts) to get to this new golf course. 

Amidst conversation and an unfamiliar route we turn down a crescent that appears to be a dead end or loop. We see an old man walking down his driveway to unlock his car (presumably to get in and drive), a woman jogging on the left, and just a bit farther down we let a father and his son riding bicycles cut in front of us toward a pathway (or catwalk) and they head down toward some park. 

Now we are still conversing about which way we should go and I absentmindedly turn down the same crescent we just were on, effectively going in a circle. What do we see when we go down that same street we just passed 2 minutes ago? We see that old man walking down to his car exactly how he had previously. That same woman jogging in the exact same spot (did she stop to tie her shoes??) and the kicker was the father and son cutting in front of us to go down that exact same pathway that we saw them go down just 2-3 minutes earlier. 

I casually say to my bro ""hmm, a glitch in the system"", but he is flabbergasted at the scenario. I have had many oddities of that nature happen before but he seemed floored by the experience. We still laugh about that to this day and I think it's a neat thing to share. I'm just glad he witnessed it too so I know I'm not completely off my rocker.

A hatch opened up, and inside was a child about my age with light brown hair and wearing a grey-blue jump suit. This child told me he was one of my descendants ( great or great-great grandson, can't remember, this puts the invention of time travel at 80-100 years in the future), and that I had done something that would cause the invention of time travel, and so this visit was somehow important to that.

Being a skeptic at the age of 12, I asked him for proof. The next thing I know, I am standing on the hardwood floor of the kitchen of my aunt and uncle in St. Louis. I remember being stunned, then realizing I have be careful not to wake their yappy little dog. After about 30 seconds of prowling around to confirm where I am at, I am taken home back to my room. The child again stresses that something I do leads to the invention of time travel

I did not travel in time, but I traveled several hundred miles in the blink of an eye. I accepted the fact that perhaps they didn't want to have some novice like me getting dumped into some random point of the future/past.

For many years after, I am puzzled. I am not the best at physics, so it is unlikely I myself have much of a hand in inventing time travel. So how was I involved?

I get married, yep, thats the first step to having descendants! But after nearly a decade, no children. The idea seems more and more unlikely as the years add up. When I do recall my experience, I pass it off as a vivid dream, as it seems less and likely I will have kids, rendering it moot.

Then, this January, we're both getting older, we realize if we are going to have kids, it needs to be now, or else the bioligical clock will have run down. We change our diets, we lose weight. My wife starts doing cardio. In late april, Aunt Flo is late, and finally, a positive pregnancy test!

We go into the doctor several weeks later, and there is the baby on the ultrasound. And the first thing that pops into my head after seeing the fetus on ultrasound, is that experience from when I was 12. I've closed the causality loop. I will have descendants, and they will invent time travel. My baby has to be healthy for this to occur. So when I worry, I think back to my experience when I was 12. My baby is gonna be fine.

So why am I telling a bunch of random redditors this? Well, I want to ensure that causal loop really does occur. I want every world line branch from this point forward, to believe that time travel will be invented. I don't know if consciousness plays a role in worldline splitting, but if it does, I am hedging my bets. More people knowing, believing, repeating it, can only help if it does.

And 25 years later, what is my purpose in all this? I was simply told I had done something to invent time travel. And now I know what that 'something' is, simply telling my child what I was told, and him/her repeating the message down my lineage, till one of them comes back and visits me when I was 12, and closes the loop. 

TL;DR; crusoe is part of a causality loop that eventually results in the invention of time travel. His first child is the next link in that chain.

This really happened to me and my friend last summer. She's someone I've known since high school, although she was in middle school when we met. This story is something we don't speak of anymore because it quite frankly makes her feel very, very uncomfortable. I had never dreamt of a world of clairvoyants before, but here I am.

It was a Friday and we were hanging out at the Duck Pond, a little park at a town a few over from our own. After walking around for a bit, we decide to sit at the bench area where there's an overhang to cover against the shade. My friend sits herself down on top of the picnic table, as she normally does, and I sit alongside her. ""You know, something happened the other day when I was with my friends…""

""Oh yea, I know. You already told me about it, right? There were some men following you, I know it already.""

""What… how did you know that?"" She stared at me with her jaw agape.

""Uhm, you told me about this last weekend didn't you? I thought we had a whole conversation. You were walking down Goffle Road and it was getting dark and there were…""

""…some men. Yeah. But that didn't happen last weekend.""

Confused, I just shrugged. ""No, of course it did. I remember very clearly you telling me about all this before. Your friends were walking down the street when some guys started cat-calling you and you started to freak out a little, but one of your friends had a knife on her so she kept her hands in her pockets, just in case.""

My friend froze. ""Alright, this is just fucking weird. You tell me what you know, ok? Cuz I don't even know what's going on right now.""

I sighed, still very much befuddled. ""Uhm, so you were out with your friends last weekend when you realized you had to walk back to your car across town. You didn't do anything you wouldn't normally do, but there were some creeps hanging out on the porch above their driveway. At first you didn't really mind them until you couldn't hear them anymore… that's when you got suspicious and picked up your pace. Eventually, the men started following you from a distance, but they quickly drew closer."" I paused. ""Well, until the police shined their lights on you from their car.""

""I don't think you get it."" Her hand touched my shoulder. ""Listen, this happened just the other day, not last weekend. How'd you even know about the police officer? I only told one of our friends about this but I didn't fill her in on that.""

""I don't know. Seriously, I think you're overreacting. You already told me all this! Afterward, the police officer shielded you from the men, but they ran away on their own once they recognized the type of vehicle you were all near.""

Her hand was well off my shoulder by this point, and she had climbed down from the picnic table. Practically trembling, my friend repeated, ""This happened just the other day. What the fuck?… *What the fuck!?* How do you know about all this?""

""I…""

""Were you there?! Listen, that's the only way you can know about all this,"" her voice began to rise in a nervous fervor. ""Just stop it, alright? You can't possibly have known…""

The pieces started to come together for me, and suddenly it hit me like a ton of bricks. ""I dreamt it all.""

""…what?""

""That's what happened. I thought you called to tell me about this but we never talk on the phone. I remember now…"" I shook my head in affirmation. ""I had this dream about you last weekend and it was so real, so vivid. I just… thought it really happened, I guess.""

""But it *did* really happen! Just not when you said it did.""

There was a good five minutes of silence before we acknowledged just how out-of-the-ordinary my storytelling was. In no way could I have known that my friend was out and accosted by some strange men.

I slap my hand onto the phone and tap the answer button as I drag it off the table and drop it onto my ear.

I answered with a yawning ""hello"", and whatever was on the other end replied with ""You need to wake up.""

It didn't quite register, I figured I wasn't awake enough, so I said ""Hold on a sec"", got up, walked to the sink in my room to wash my face, went back to my phone and picked it up. ""Okay, what?"", I asked.

I know that if you lie enough, things will eventually seem to ""come true"", but I really don't lie as often as this post makes it seem. And when I do, weird shit happens. That and I've been plagued with odd coincidence my entire life. Here's just a few of the things that have happened.

- Lied about the winning bid amount of an ebay auction of a guitar I was selling early to keep my mom from asking/bugging me about it, winning bid was exact number I lied when the auction actually ended 4 days later. ($477) 

- Best friend moves away for good, lied to someone that they were moving back, got a call they next day from best friend saying they're moving back at the end of the month.

- Lied to dad about scoring an internship, scored an actual internship next day. 

- Lied to 3rd grade classmates that my dad was friends with a ""famous"" person, within weeks my dad met and befriended an actual ""famous"" person. 

- Told friend I was getting a new tattoo over xmas break, realized I didn't have the money for it, forgot about it, had another friend offer to buy me one as a xmas gift (on a whim, her idea), got tattoo.

- Applied for a PA job with a friend on feature film shooting in my hometown in MS (of which I now live 7 hours away from in a different state). Never heard back, figured we didn't make the cut, forgot about it. 6 months later, ended up home visting my mom, got a call from an out-of-state sound department friend looking for help on that same feature. Got hired in a higher position I originally applied for/was rejected from and got my friend hired too. This is even more remarkable by the fact the sound dept is from NYC, was hired on that feature a week into production because the former sound dept was fired. These guys had been to the South only once before (when I met them) and just happened to remember by chance that I was from Mississippi. This job ended up being a career defining one.

- Was adopted at birth (open adoption, so I knew my birth mother's name and that she was from another state). My mom and I end up moving to a suburb of Jackson, MS. Mom joins neighborhood Bunko league to meet friends her age, is sat on the first night with a woman who talked a lot about her family. It was found out that night that woman is first cousins with my birthmother and they grew up together. I had been playing with this woman's kids not even realizing they were blood relatives of mine. These were the first blood relatives of mine I'd met. 

- Lied to parents about being Key PA on a film (they hate me working in this industry, so I decided to make things sound better than they were) got promoted to Key PA the next day. 

- Stupidly told my screenwriting professor that I had a completed act of a screenplay to turn in as homework when I didn't. He told me to email it to him before lunch (10 minutes away). Thinking I was screwed, I started hastily writing a one act screenplay. Before writing the first slug line, I got a random email from a film student friend of mine I had met when we both interned on a set out of state (he goes to school out of state too) with an attachment of a compressed folder of screenwriting projects he had completed the year before with the subject line ""In case you need it..."" and the message ""Use any of them, I never turned them in. have fun!"" 

That and weird things like really wanting to hear a song or artist and realizing I don't have their CD in my car only to turn on the radio and it be playing. Or knowing I've lost something before it happens. Just the thought ""I'm going to lose this"" and then losing it within the next few days. I'm uber careful with my belongings, but this has happened to me a lot. Or a gut feeling that someone I know has died only to get a call minutes later. This has happened to me three times. 

I finally met my birthmother when I turned 16, and she told me and my birth sister that our family was ""different"" (she wouldn't elaborate past that) and I talked about the weird shit that has happened to me in the past. She only said ""I know. It happens to us too."" I don't know how much of that I believe, but strange stuff does seem to keep occurring. Is it just because I'm aware of it being weird or does this stuff happen to others too?

In late 2012 I had a nightmare (which in itself was weird for me because I only have a vivid dream every few years) it was my older sister screaming in my face except no sound was coming out. It was just her making an unrealistically large scream face 2 inches from my face and I was just standing there. I didn't recognize where I was or who the people were around me and why they weren't helping. I tried to play cool in the dream and not react but I remember losing my calm facial expression for a split second and then worrying that she noticed my fear. Then she finally screamed, deafeningly ""WHAT? DID THAT SCARE YOU?!"" and then I woke up a bit startled but quickly went back to sleep.

Last month my sister bought a house with her boyfriend (now fiancée) and during the house-warming party I was walking around the house giving myself the tour when on my way back to the crowd in the kitchen my sister jumped around a corner and did the same screaming face I remembered from my dream accompanied by a puny yell. I just looked at her confused as she said ""WHAT?! THAT DIDN'T SCARE YOU?!"". I looked around and realized that this was the place I saw in the dream, the people I didn't recognize were my sisters' fiancée's family who I'd never met before and they were just sitting and half laughing, not helping because it was just a prank.

I never said anything to her and just laughed it off but to this day it still makes me uncomfortable knowing that the only dream I've had in the last 3ish years was a vivid scene of an exact scenario I would later experience in real life. 

And this wasn't even the first time I've had a dream like this involving my sister. Even crazier, one time she told me how she had a spooky deja vu dream involving me but I never made the connection that I had too. I wish I would have asked her more about her dream.

**EDIT:** I don't know if I can bring up the dream to my sister. I think it would just be awkward and I'd end up looking like a crazy person. Even if I did ask her there's a possibility her dream was completely different and unrelated or she might have even forgot saying she'd had one before since she was around my age when she said that which means it was at least 6 years ago. Even if she did remember and she helped me understand what the hell my dream was all about it might just end up scaring her and that isn't any good. Anyway, I'm just making up excuses now.

It was July, and a weekend, so I was off to visit my Granny's. My Grandma had this little green turtle sandbox in her backyard that I loved to play in while my grandparents sat in chairs next to it, watching me and my brother play in the sand. This particular weekend, my brother was talking to my Grandparents about something or other, and he got up to walk across the sandbox, passing in front of me to get to my grandparent's sitting area. Everything is fine and all, until 6 months later.

6 months later it is Fall turning into Winter, with cold fronts coming in and rain pouring down from the clouds like it swallowed an ocean. I go to sleep on a Friday, to wake up on a Saturday morning in July (The visiting Grandparent's house one) with the weather just peachy and my mom telling me to get ready to go. I am thinking ""YAY GRANDMAS AND WARM WEATHER!"" so the fact that I might have just time-traveled didn't even float through my head. I re-experience the next 6 months, having constant Deja-Vu but never fully registering that I completely skipped back a full 6 months. I forget the incident by the time I am 12, having moved on to playing Halo 2 on the original Xbox and such.

I am 22 now, recently an IT Technical student graduate. I experienced the same 6 Months Setback once again, so let me explain. On Friday the 17th in August, I began classes at Georgia Tech. I went through all of the dates up until February 18th, 2013. Again, I went to sleep that Monday night and woke up on August 17th, 2012. I just re-experienced everything. I had a huge Deja-Vu moment up until yesterday, when I finally realized that everything wasn't just Deja-Vu but I actually had re-experienced those 6 months, going through everything once again. I'm worried when/if this might happen again, and why is it happening.

Now, I know this is going to raise some questions (Sandy hook being a major one). I only can say that up until yesterday, I couldn't tell you what would happen next, I would only have a feeling of ""I've experienced this before. What?"". Just ask away, I suppose.

In my elementary school we used to have to line up for class before school started. My mother worked at the school I went to so I was always one of the first people there. By where my class lined up there was always a group of older kids playing handball (American not European) against the wall. They always hit the ball really hard and I got hit a few times before, nothing too serious but it hurt a bit. 

So, one day my mother drops me off, gives me my lunch, kisses me, and tells me not to get hit by the ball. She was very stern in the way she told me almost like I had a choice in the matter. Anyway, about 5 to 10 minutes pass and I'm watching the handball game and all of the sudden the ball comes zooming for my head and I had one of the craziest experiences of my life.

Time stopped. The whole world around me became black and white with just a few splotches of color here and there. The kids who were running were stopped in their tracks. The leaves that were being blown by the wind stood still, there was no sound, and I was the only sentient being who was able to perceive what was going on. I looked ahead of me and the ball was about 3-4 feet in front of me, just stopped in space. For some reason I wasn't scared and I knew exactly what to do. I just stepped to the side out of the path of the ball. All of the sudden the kids started playing again, the leaves began to rustle again, and the sounds, color, and feeling of the world around me came back. And of course, the ball zoomed past and missed my head.

We have never been quite sure of what was going on, but on several occasions, we have lost many hours of time while traveling around the state.  Sometimes it was just myself, or one of my friends who was in the car with me.  

One of the most memorable occurrences of this is from about seven years ago.  It has stuck with me since, and has freaked me out.

At this time, I was still living in Flint, Michigan with the parents (it was about a year before I moved to Grand Haven).   My friend and I were headed up to the Beulah/Frankfort area to camp.  The trip should have been 3-3.5 hours, and we have made this trip MANY times before (we would head up there several times each year, and my family spent every summer up there in my childhood since we had a lake house on Platte Lake).

My friend and I left home at 3am so we could get some early morning fly fishing in when we arrived.  Somewhere around 2/3 of the way through the trip (we were on M115 just north of Cadillac) everything started seeming unnaturally calm out on the road (The road is in the middle of a national forest so things are calm as is.  This was a very eerie calm).  We did not notice anything else.  The sun was just peeking over the horizon, and the sky was starting to get light.  Eventually the daylight filled the land.

The next thing we both knew is we were coming up to the us-31 intersection in Benzonia.  I glanced at the clock, and it said it was 12:30pm.  My friend noticed this as well.   Thinking that my radio was wrong, I checked the cell phone, and it too said 12:30pm; so did the sign at a bank.  

My friend and I found ourselves VERY confused.  It is hard to explain the feeling.  It was like WTF?!?!

We should have arrived in town around 6-6:30am and instead we arrived six hours later than expected.

We were not tired during the trip (got lots of sleep the day before, and I drive over 120,000 miles a year, so i am used to long distance trips).  We were also both totally familiar with the route.

The gas tank in the vehicle was still fairly full and it would have been empty if we randomly drove around in a daze the whole time.  We checked our credit card statements later that month and there were no gas purchases during the lost time.  The mileage on the truck seemed normal for that trip.

The strange thing is, the time loss was so seamless.  We have no recollection of the lost time, or stopping.  We were doing about 60mph the whole way.  To us, the trip seemed like a normal amount of time for that drive, but the clocks said differently.

It was just a total mindfuck.

It has happened several more times over the years to lesser extents.   Anyone have any clue into wtf happened?

So here we are...thoughts welcome :)

Hi, this is the first time I have written in with anything but I specifically joined up to see if there was anything on here relating to my experience, there wasn’t so I’d love to hear what others say on this. I am still quite freaked out by this so I’ll do my best to set the scene a little bit.

I recently left my job and have been unemployed for about a month. I went to an interview on Thursday last week for a job I really wanted, and they rang back on Friday morning to offer me the job. I was so happy and decided to go to the Tesco to get some nice food to celebrate.

So anyway I walked out of the shop and set off walking home but I noticed someone staring at me out of the corner of my eye about 10m in front of me. I looked over and there was indeed someone staring back. The guy was identical to me, in every way, even down to the slightly pronounced underbite which is quite recognisable. And he looked terrified as he looked at me. As I met his eyes I immediately started feeling extremely nauseous and my hearing a thumping in my ears like I was about to pass out or something. I remember not being able to hear anything during this point as well apart from the thumping.

So then, the guy turns away and walks into a side street and out of sight. The weird thing was that as soon as he broke the gaze I felt better straight away, like someone that was sitting on my chest just got off. So I carried on walking in that direction towards that side street and looked up it and the guy was sprinting – full on hell for leather sprinting – down the street away from the corner in which I saw him. The guy was dressed in a nice suit with an open collar black shirt and it was weird to see him running in that gear.

I spoke to friends as soon as I got back and they told me that the area of Liverpool centre where I saw the person has been known to have something called time-slips which can be explained with this video - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4782MavWl4. But this wasn’t the same as the other experiences described in that video, this guy was the same age approx. in the same style suit that would be worn today.

Has anyone had anything similar happen? Any comments or suggestions would be welcome.

I am in my late 40s, consider myself a rational, logical person but have been having lots of glitches over the last few years.  I have been documenting everything, because it's seemed so surreal and I keep telling myself there must be a logical explanation. I am going to give examples straight from my journal -- these are not reconstructed memories.  

For this first example, I need to give some context: 

Awhile ago I began noticing triple numbers all the time. Particularly on license plates. I searched the 'net and this is a common occurrence; those in spiritual circles say that certain numbers have certain meanings, and are messages from ""angels"" and spirit guides.  For example, 555 means “big change” and 999 means “endings and new beginnings.” But I also very well understand that brains are rigged for pattern recognition, and all the other logical explanations.... it's just that these numbers kept dogging me, quite intrusive, hard to ignore.  

Journal excerpt (recorded within about 20 minutes of the event): 

“Driving to work. Watching the stream of triple digits on license plates going by…  figured I might was well entertain this idea that these may be ""angel"" messages.  I would ask a question in my mind, and receive a stream of triple digits in response.... 

Then it hit me:   how could the universe know I was going to ask just that question, at exactly the same time a car with 999 on its plate would drive by?  And it dawned on  me, “I am in the matrix. This isn’t real. It’s a simulated, virtual reality that responds to my thoughts.”  

... so I ask, ""why don't you talk to me in words instead of numbers?"" and  RIGHT THEN, the very next car, a plate that says HI goes by (just HI, no other numbers or letters), followed close behind by one that says NEO... “

I've been lurking around here for a while, and finally decided to post an experience with my house on 18 Spruce Street.  Let me begin by saying that I'm a serious skeptic, borderline atheist, and I was back then.  I did everything I could to disprove what happened in that house, but I came up with nothing, time after time.  I don't talk often about what happened there.  My fiance knows some of it, no one knows all of it. 

I firmly believe it wasn't ghosts or anything.  The house wasn't on an indian burial ground, we were the first people to live there, and I don't really believe in ghosts.  I'm not sure what it all really was.  We only lived there for six months.  But it seems like it fits more in this subreddit just due to the nature of what happened.  It felt more like time and space just weren't... right.  They weren't normal.

**THE HOUSE**

It was really super suburban, but a little far out.  Three levels including a garage, and apparently a HOA that we never dealt with.  The subdivision had been built by a building group and our house had been built by the head of it.  It was sorta tricked out in a way only he would like, but it was a good house overall.  He decided to rent the house and find something smaller for reasons that were never made clear.  My dad only met him once.  It was only about a year old when we moved in.  We only had a 6 month lease, and I was a senior in high school.  Apparently it was a REALLY good deal.

**THE FIRST TIME**

The first night we moved in was the first time something happened.  The first time was to my brother, who was about 13 or 14 at the time.  My brother and I have never been overly close, but the kid doesn't make up things.  He knocked on my door at about 2am and said that he couldn't get back into his room, I assumed he'd locked himself out.  His story was different.

He'd fallen asleep in his new bed, in a bedroom right across from mine.  He'd felt that sensation where you wake up and feel like you're falling.  Except he had been falling.  He said that he had opened his eyes and had suddenly been on the downstairs couch.  I initially wrote this off as him screwing with me, or he'd been sleep walking (which he had no history of).  I told him to go back to bed, but he couldn't get into his room, so I figured he'd locked himself out.

But the doorknob turned.  It was more like something heavy was on the other side of the door.  I pushed hard and it gave way, letting me into my brother's room.  He was practically hyperventilating from fear at this point, so big sister had to investigate.  I peered behind the door and saw the ottoman to the couch.  There was a unanimous ""What the fucking hell?"" from both of us.  The thing has to be lifted by two people.  It was huge.  And it was flush against the door, it had to be done from the inside.  My brother would have had to have jumped out of a 2nd story window into thorn bushes to get out of his window, and we didn't have a ladder that tall.

I let him sleep in my room that night.  Not that we really slept.  Our parents didn't believe us.

**SMALL THINGS**

After that, things were sort of quiet for a bit.  The biggest thing was the unplugging of things from outlets.  This house was built by an electrician (our landlord too, this is important later), and he decided to install a metric fuck ton of outlets in it.  In my 8'x8' room alone, there were six.  My brother's, slightly bigger, had five.  The living room had eight.  I'd never seen anything quite like it.

I'd be home alone, leave the room to go to the bathroom, and come back to my laptop being plugged in to another outlet completely.  It happened a lot with the toaster.

It wasn't uncommon for any of us to take a nap, and wake up an hour before we fell asleep.  That happened probably twice a month.

Sometimes the rooms would ""reset"" as I called it.  It happened about once a month, even to my Mom.  That was probably the most disturbing thing to me.  I'd go clean up a bedroom, leave for a while, and return to it looking exactly like it had before.  Like I'd never even touched it.  Chip bags crinkled in the same way and place, plates with the same food on it.  One time a sandwich reappeared, after I'd already eaten it.  It always reset by about 6 hours.  It made me question reality in all sorts of ways.

**THE BIG ONE**

I've skipped over some of them, but this story wouldn't be complete with the big one at the end.  There's just no way to describe how scared I was.  It was about three weeks before we moved out.

In the perfect cliche, it was a dark and stormy Saturday night, around 1am.  My parents were long asleep.  I decided to come downstairs to get a drink.  I stopped to look out the front windows because the lightning was pretty intense.  I heard a soft choking/laughing noise from the direction of the living room, and I turned around.

From my front door, you could clearly see the living room and dining room, with a small wall blocking about 6ft between them that you couldn't see.  The stairs blocked the view of the kitchen.  To get from the living room to the kitchen, you *have* to pass through the dining room, which I could clearly see.

The sound was coming from my brother, who was standing in front of the fireplace with his side to me.  Being 13/14, he was always sort of slumped over.  But he was standing straight up like he was at attention, his feel together and arms straight at his side.  He was staring at a spot above the fireplace that held nothing in particular, and was wearing a red tshirt with grey and yellow long athletic pants and no shoes.

I called out his name three times, before finally yelling, ""Junior, stop fucking with me.  What are you doing?""  That nickname always got a rise out of him.  But he kept standing there.  It was probably only about a minute, but it felt like an hour.  Suddenly, he turned on his heel and walked way faster than normal toward the dining room.  The only thought I had at that moment was that that wasn't how my brother walked.  I was completely terrified.

Fighting every horror movie instinct, I ran into the dining room, hoping to beat the shit out of him if he was just screwing with me somehow.  But when I looked left into the living room, he wasn't there.  I would have to have seen him.

I jumped 10ft in the air when I heard, ""Were you calling me, theSisterGeek?"" and a microwave going off.  My brother was pulling bagel bites out of the oven, and had his arms laden with mountain dew and chips.  The microwave had started only a few minutes prior, which he would have had to been in the kitchen to start.  It hadn't been him.  And my brother was wearing the same clothes as the version of him I saw.  A red tshirt with grey and yellow long athletic pants and no shoes.  I told him what I saw.  He told me that he saw me standing in the living room a few seconds before I ran in the room, but that I was wearing jeans.

I want to say that we then investigated what just happened.  But we both noped out pretty hard, choosing to hide in my room for the rest of the night.

**THE END**

After the last, big incident it tapered off a bit.  The outlet thing kept happening, but the rooms never reset again.  It all stopped when we moved.

To this day, the landlord has never cashed our last two rent checks.  The man disappeared.  They still haven't found him.  We don't know if it was because of money trouble or if they'll find his body eventually.

I do know that no one lives there now.  The bank eventually took the house, because no one was making mortgage payments.  It was resold by the person who bought it from the bank, and is now on the market again.  The rest of the neighborhood is filled.  But not that house.

I will be happy to answer any questions or clarify anything.  Lots of other stuff happened that was along the same lines as what's above, but this hits a couple of the highlights.  But it feels great to tell someone.  Maybe it'll help with the nightmares.

I put the bass down, leaning it against the second story window of my bedroom, but didn't turn off the amp. My dad was in the hallway outside my room, waiting for me. As I turned to leave, the amp started clearly playing what sounded like German voices.

My dad had taken German in college and I had taken a single year of it in middle school. Both of us heard it and recognized the language (through simple words such as pronouns) but were unable to understand the content of the spoken sentences because the voice was talking too quickly. It theoretically could have been a similar-sounding language, such as Dutch.

The sounds faded after about 25 seconds.. I went over and moved the neck of the bass guitar on the window attempting to recreate the phenomenon, but was unsuccessful.

The only thing I can think of is that somehow, radio waves from either (a) fluent German-speaking people in my area (somewhat unlikely), or (b) Germany itself, 3700 miles away (even more unlikely), managed to hit the double-pane windows in such a way to travel into the bass and vibrate the strings to reach the practice amp to produce the sound.

EDIT: It was still a trippy experience, but it seems the consensus is that it was indeed rogue radio waves bouncing off the whateversphere and ""magically"" making my room sound like a U-Boat during an emergency dive.

Also asked my mom if maybe she bought my sister the same pair (she used to buy us socks for every holiday...), but she told me she always bought my sister the short socks, and she always got us different patterns anyway.

In one these games, you would take a treat jar with you while you hid somewhere in the house and shake it intermittently until he was alerted and found you. 

One afternoon I was playing this game with my dog. I went upstairs and hid behind the door in one of the bedrooms at the end of the hall. (You know, in that space between the wall and the door when the door is open and you can see through the crack in the doorjamb) Through this crack, you can see the entire hallway.

So I had my eye to the crack, shaking the treat jar every once in a while and I saw my dog run up the stairs and into one of the other bedrooms in the hall looking for me. I shook the jar to give him more of hint, but he didn't come out of the room. 

I stayed there with my eye on the bedroom he'd disappeared inside, expecting him to come out and find me. 
A short while passed and he still hadn't come out. I figured if it was taking him this long he wasn't going to find me and I'd better go get him. I turned around to step out from behind the door and there's my dog sitting patiently beside me, panting happily for his treat.

This gave me chills because I hadn't seen him come out of the room or approach the place where I was hiding (the whole hallway was visible). But more importantly, I hadn't heard him. People who have a dog with dog tags know how much of a jangling racket they make whenever they move around the house. You always heard him coming.

I had heard absolutely nothing. It was like he just appeared by my feet. That was a last time I ever played that game. I still can't quite grasp what happened.",,False,,t5_2tcwa,False,,,True,t3_1jrs8m,http://www.reddit.com/r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix/comments/1jrs8m/here_boy/,

For those of you from Los Angeles, Santa Barbara, or familiar with Freebirds in general, you know of the really cool, calming vibe that emanates from the store.

Not today.

The second I walk in, something seems out of place right off the bat. I just do a double take, shrug it off and go about my business. I finally get my burrito and a drink and head over to the drink stand.

Glitch imminent.

As I walk over, there is a little kid waiting with his mom as she is putting the lids on several cups (big to go order) and he is watching me intently. I look at him and I think to myself ""huh, he kinda looks like me when I was younger."" I don't think a lot about it, so I go to push the ice machine. No ice. Suddenly, the little boy says to me ""it looks like the little man is out of ice today.""

Backstory, when I was a little kid, I thought there was a man inside drink machines that had each flavor and a large bucket of ice and whenever you would hit a lever, he'd dispense your drink or ice for you. 

So already I'm very much taken aback by this because I had a sudden realization and thinking ""how in the fuck did you know my childhood"" and having an odd moment. I smile and then turn to get my drink--Sierra Mist.

Or so I think. Here is the glitch.

On one side of the machine (the left) is Dr. Pepper. The other side is Sierra Mist. I hit the lever for sierra mist and out comes Dr. Pepper instead but at the same time, Sierra mist is pouring Dr. Pepper. I suddenly stop. The young boy laughs and says ""He's playing with you!"" I'm really anxious now and I go to hit the lever again. Out comes Sierra Mist, and the far Dr. Pepper dispenser is off. But when I turn to look back at the boy, this can't be more than 2-3 seconds mind you, he and his mother are gone. I should have easily seen them leave, but not a single trace. I run outside and look around. They are completely gone. There's only one way out of the restaurant and that's the front door. 

For the rest of the day, I was on edge and feeling like my life's timeline was re-intersecting in the future. And now that I'm thinking about it, the ""mom"" looked eerily like my mother around the same time as I was of that age.

This subreddit should be about **Glitches**: Metaphysical, abnormal occurrences that can't be explained with our current understanding of the universe. And, if I'm wrong about that, then hell, consider me unsubbed.*

Bear with me, as this story requires a bit of set up. In 8th grade, I had a really close friend who was one of those punk rock girls. We had our quick fling, but it didn't work out. Anyway, I started seeing this new girl, whom I really liked. She was smart, witty, and pretty, and I don't think my old friend could handle it.

Unbeknownst to me, my friend got incredibly jealous, and decided to sabotage my relationship. She calls this girl and tells her that I was only going out with her to prove I could get a girlfriend. The new girl gets upset, and decides to break it off with me, leaving me completely heartbroken. Fast forward a bit of time, and my friend and I are still not on good terms; looking at her made me so angry.

One day, I was walking by her table at lunch, and my ex friend makes a snide, spiteful comment in my direction. I just about go ape shit, push her over, and start strangling her. I held her neck in my right hand, squeezing, and lifted my left hand for a left hook, and swung. 

Right as the punch was about to connect, everything went dark, and I managed to punch a wall instead. I yelped, and coddled my hand. My eyes adjusted to the darkness, and I realize I was in my room. I looked at my clock, and it was the night before. ""Was that all a dream?"" I slowly nodded off to sleep.

The next day, I had forgotten about last night's oddity, and went about the day as normal. I was walking by her table, at lunch, and my ex friend turns and makes a snide spiteful comment in my direction. I just about go ape shit, push her over, and start strangling her. I lifted my left arm for a hook, but then, my mind flashed. I remembered the previous night. I'd been here before... ""Was it all a dream?""

I put my hand down, let her go, and walked away....

I know that, if I had swung and hit that girl, my life would be too different. This assault would have been on my record, and, knowing the girl and her family, I would have been fucked. My parents couldn't have lawyered up enough to protect us. Not to mention the girl's shady friends, anyone of which would have been willing to hand my ass to me. Things would have gone differently for me. I'm thankful that somewhere, somehow, I was able to get that second chance.

I was walking down the hall.. and suddenly I felt *very* nauseous, to the point I needed to take a knee. I then saw my friend's house burning. It wasn't long, particular very detailed, just his house, burning.

He lived down the street from me, and my pops used to be a firefighter and had a police scanner always running. I went to the pay phone, called my dad, and asked if anything on the scanner came on and to check down the road for anything. He said it was all clear, and then, ""why""? I couldn't answer because I didn't even know myself. 

I brushed it off and went back to fucking off w/ friends. I mentioned this to him jokingly, ""dude I don't know why but I like had a daydream or something that your house was on fire, isn't that fucked?"" He kind of looked at me like, ""wtf kind of daydream is that?"". I didn't know what else to say, I swept it under the rug and forgot about it, and the night continued..

About 30-45 minutes later my mom comes strolling in the school, her face pale and she looked sick. [Her and my dad were separated by this point.. she had no idea about that prior call] She power-walked to me and pulled me aside, ""Brandon's house is on fire...it's engulfed."" 

I stood there thinking she was fucking with me and kind of forced a half-assed smile, like, ""Ya ya, you got me..""; but her face didn't break. She was serious. Being we were close friends, I had to tell him ""Dude.. your house is really on fire, my mom came to come grab you to get you to your family"".

I just discovered this subreddit today, and after reading a lot of the stories, I realized that I have a story that no one else has heard and I haven't thought about for years. 

Back in 4th grade, I had 2 classrooms, one for PE and one rest of the subjects. This was a private school, so we had PE in the gym and one teacher taught the rest of the subjects in another classroom. 

So anyway, on that particular day, our main teacher was out, so we had a substitute teacher that day. Before we headed off to lunch which was at 11:30, I remember getting up to ask my teacher if I could use the restroom. However, on my walk up to her desk, I remember looking at the clock and checking the time (we had to write what time we ""checked out"") as well as kneeling to tie my shoelaces. After doing so, I went up to her, checked out at 11:17 AM, and went to use the restroom, coming back at 11:22 AM.

After lunch, class resumed like normal and I did what normal 4th graders do in that sense that I chatted while I worked. Eventually, I had to use the restroom again, even though school was going to end at 3:00, which was not too far away. However, we were only allowed to go once a day unless it was an emergency (we had like 2 emergency passes) so I got up to go check out again, hoping to use my last emergency pass. However, half way up to the desk, I checked the time on the clock.

It said 11:17 AM.

The next thing I know, I kneeled in the exact same position and tied my shoelaces (they were untied again). Strangely though, I felt like I couldn't change my action; it was as if I was forced to do those actions that I thought I had just done before lunch. 

Afterwards, I went up to the desk and asked my teacher if I could use the restroom. She said yes, which was odd, because she usually remembers who has gone and who hasn't and if you already had, she would always ask for an emergency pass, so I quickly went to the log book to see if I had gone at 11:17. However, it had no trace of me saying I had left to use the restroom at that time.

I left for the restroom, and when I came back, I checked the clock to make sure I wasn't going crazy. It said it was 2:52. At this point, I was about as confused as a 4th grader can be. I walked up to the desk to sign back in, and surprisingly, it showed that I signed out at 2:47 EP (EP for emergency pass). 

To this day, I still have no idea what the hell happened. To be honest, I haven't thought about that occurrence since 5th grade, so the event is still a bit hazy to me. But reading some of these stories brought up this memory. I'm not really sure about theories, but there is certainly something about the pattern in the timing of events: I left for the restroom 13 minutes before a transitional period (i.e. lunch, school ending), and came back both times 8 minutes before a transitional period.

At the time, I worked graveyard shift at a truck stop in the middle of bumfuck, nowhere. It wasn't the most exciting job in the world, but at least it allowed for my nocturnal sleep schedule, which was nice.

Still, I've always been a bit of a procrastinator. Each night I would leave for work at 11:30pm, floor it down dark, country roads, and was often a little bit late. This irritated co-workers from the previous shift since they had to wait for me to get there. So, on this particular night, when I woke up and looked at the clock on my phone, I freaked the fuck out.

'Oh shit,' I thought, 'I'm gonna be so fired this time.'

It was around 11:40pm and I was still in bed. I threw on my clothes, ran outside, and hopped in the car as fast as I could. My eyes were glued to the dashboard clock for almost the entire drive.

11:45pm... 11:50pm... 11:55pm... I pulled into work at the last minute, ran inside and clocked in...

It was 8pm.  

Jessica, a co-worked from the shift before me, asked me why I was four hours early. Confused and disoriented, I popped a seat on the counter, next to the cash register, as I tried to figure out what the fuck was going on. After a while, she convinced me that it wasn't midnight after all, and wanted to know if I was on drugs. 

I wasn't. 

I guess I hallucinated the whole time, even when I looked at different clocks, and when I watched each minute pass, one after another, on the drive. It was hard to believe.

Here is one reason:

http://www.reddit.com/r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix/comments/14uyg9/a_house_saved_my_life/c7gv0r5?context=3

And I will also elaborate a bit more...

The original theory was a thought experiment and was reliant upon a quantum state of a particle. So even if you ignore the above reasons for quantum suicide being invalid then you're still ignoring a very important point, which is...

If we take an example of 'dying' in a car accident, but you actually didn't and you believe this is somehow explained by quantum suicide (by which you should actually be saying 'quantum immortality'), then you are essentially arguing that quantum principles are applicable on the macroscopic scale.

To explain...

Cars, the people controlling the cars, the minds of the people, and the individual neurons in the brain of each person are all macroscopic objects. This means they are all visible and measurable via direct optical means. Quantum states do *not* apply to the macroscopic scale, only the microscopic (individual particle) scale.

So *even if* you believed in quantum suicide/immortality (and let me please stress the word 'believe'), then it wouldn't apply to car crashes or any real world situation. The only way it would ever apply is if your death was *solely based* on the quantum state of an individual particle. Is this likely? No, not even the tiniest bit. Quantum states break down (or 'decohere') way before they reach the macroscopic scale.

So essentially, if you want to believe that you can die and 'respawn' or re-route your death somehow, then *please, please, please* don't use the term 'quantum suicide' because it is *not* the same thing, and there is nothing 'quantum' about that belief. People love scientific terms and feel that they have a real explanation for something when scientific terms are used, but this term is being abused and totally misunderstood on this subreddit.

I love this subreddit, and I think there have been some really great glitch stories recently! In fact, the best I've seen since I started coming here. I'd love to keep this place full of genuinely possible explanations, though, and not misused science. Wouldn't it be amazing if we had a glitch with loads of evidence that couldn't be explained away by known science? Isn't that what we're looking for here instead of 'here are my thoughts on the universe when I was high, after I glossed over a scientific term that I didn't really understand'?",,False,,t5_2tcwa,False,,mod,True,t3_14z6jo,http://www.reddit.com/r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix/comments/14z6jo/quantum_suicide_explained/,moderator

Me and my cousin were bored on a summer day at our grandmother's house and we found a deck of cards. We decided we would play Memory (Pairs) but there was one card missing, so we could only make 25 pairs. (for example, a 9 of Diamonds is paired with 9 of Hearts, same color, same number)

We shuffled the deck, maybe over a dozen times and then just started laying the cards down randomly in a grid.

I went first.

I picked 2 random cards and it was a pair. I thought to myself ""beginner's luck"". Then I picked another 2 random cards, and it was a match again! I said to my relative: ""heh, pretty lucky"" and giggled. I took another 2 random cards, and it was a pair again. By this time I started laughing because I couldn't believe my luck. I took another 2 random cards, and it was yet another pair. We both started laughing because this was getting out of hand.

I continued to choose random cards while laughing uncontrollably because I didn't believe what I was seeing. Every single time I picked up 2 random cards, they were a match. I picked up all 25 pairs and obviously won the game.

I hope you all enjoy and I apologize in advance for the length (I feel the details are important).  

This happened in November of 1993, shortly after my 14th birthday.  My parents were divorced and it was my weekend to spend with my father.  He called me up Friday after school, apologizing and saying he wasn't feeling well (flu), really needed to rest, and couldn't spend time with me that weekend.  I was disappointed but understanding.  Dad and I were close.  

I now had an entire weekend ahead of me with no plans, so I pretty much just lounged around Friday night, and Saturday I made arrangements to spend the night with a friend.  We stayed up late doing what adolescent boys did in the 90's: sharing a beer we stole from the fridge and playing Tecmo Bowl on Nintendo.  

We finally went to bed and I slept on the couch.  For a couch, it was pretty comfy and I slept well.  For no reason that I was aware of at the time, I woke up just as it was getting light.  No one else was up yet, and while it wasn't like I ""shot up out of bed"", I remember that I was wide awake and completely aware.  I looked at my watch - it was 8:20am, too early to get up.  Before going back to sleep I had one thought: ""I wonder how dad is feeling?  I'll give him a call after I get up.""

The next thing I remember is my mother waking me up and telling me we had to go.  There was a feeling in the whole house that something was very wrong.  We went out to the car and got in.  Mom got in the back seat with me (very odd), put her arm around me and said ""Ig79, your dad's dead.""  

I don't remember much else of the ride to grandma's house (where dad had been living since the divorce), or the rest of the morning for that matter.  His body was still in the house when we arrived and it's a vision that will stay with me forever, but here's the weird part:

Myself, my mother, step-dad, brother, grandma, and the fucking coroner sitting at the dinner table.  The coroner needed a time of death for the death certificate and after going over the events of the morning, they decided he must have passed about 8:20am.  

Coincidence?  Maybe.  Was dad trying to contact me somehow?  I don't know.  It didn't feel like that.  But I do believe, completely, that I somehow felt his passing though I didn't realize it at the time.

For those interested, my dad died of a massive heart attack.  Flu-like symptoms are common.  He didn't tell anyone how sick he really was but we all think he knew.

We don't really look alike.  He's shorter and more heavyset than me and he's ghost white whereas I have an olive skin tone.  He's very messy and unorganized, but I'm a neat freak.  We are so different that while in high school, some people wouldn't even know we were brothers until someone called attention to it.  

Despite these differences, I've had several experiences of ""twin telepathy"" where we will be watching the same movie for the third or fourth time and he will comment on a small detail neither of us had noticed before, just as I was thinking about it or just about to say the same thing.  

This happens more often than I'd like, but it's rather tame I'd suppose.  One thing freaked me out really badly though.  

I had just got home from taking an exam and I was laying in my bed in our apartment; just laying there thinking.  I started feeling odd.  I was fully conscious and sober, but something was off.  It was as if everything had slowed down ever so slightly.  I kept thinking.  I don't remember why but my thoughts found their way to my brother.  

I tried picturing him in my mind but I found that I couldn't.  I couldn't for the life of me remember what he looked like.  I was searching my mind and I could not remember his face.  It was bugging me pretty badly, so I went into the next room where he was when I came home. 


I sat down on the couch and I looked at him.  He was sitting five feet away in an armchair.  He was looking down at his laptop, paying me no attention.  I looked at his face.  The thing was, I didn't see his face; I saw the top of my head sort of spliced on the bottom half of his.  They didn't match up completely.  I felt this sudden ""oh shit"" anxiety kind of feeling surge through my stomach.  

I asked him how he was doing and he didn't respond.  I asked a second time (prolly sounding freaked out), and he started talking about how he was depressed because he had an interview for an officer position in this organization he was in and it hadn't gone well.

It was almost like I could sense the words about to come out of his mouth.

He looked down and kept typing.  I tried looking away from his face, but I kept coming back to it almost compulsively.  I kept seeing pieces of me in it.  I would see my hairline, or my eye sort of pasted over his like some crude microsoft paint picture.  I looked at his hands instead since his typing was the only noise in the room.  I got stuck staring at them for prolly longer than I thought and I felt like I could almost feel him moving his hands.  

This was too much for me.  I went back to my room and laid down.  I didn't want to deal with the kind of thoughts going through my head; I just wanted to go to sleep and hopefully forget it all happened.  

I was listening to music to get my mind off it all but I couldn't sleep.  I went back into the living room and everything was fine.  My brother was sitting there, normal, looking like he always looked.  We finished talking about how his interview went, and then put on a movie.  Everything was back to normal. 

This was about two weeks ago and nothing like it has happened since.  I don't know if this constitutes a glitch or not, but I'd like to know what you guys think! Sorry about the huge wall of text!

It was at least a hundred feet tall and about five feet in diameter (my measurements may be off but it was ridiculously large to be in the middle of our backyard, which was like 50x50). On the other side of the back fence was another house.

Waking up one night to thunder, I hop my little self out of bed and run to the kitchen so I can look out the screen door, which faces the backyard. I remember thinking that I have never seen anything so fascinating and frightening in my entire life, when suddenly, flash! I can't see! I rub my eyes until they became clear again, and the first thing I see is the entire backyard aflame.

It was like watching a movie with no sound. Everything had suddenly become silent. The tree started to lean towards the house behind mine. Lightning had hit...the base of the tree? I had no time to ponder this because then it fell. No crack or snap. Just fell. The house exploded like it had been hit with a bomb. I couldn't even comprehend what had happened. Suddenly another lightning strike blinds me, and I jolt out of bed. Wait, what? It was a dream? I Rush to the kitchen to see that nothing has happened. The tree is still standing and everything is as it should be. I couldn't have been more ecstatic.

A couple weeks pass. We start to move into an apartment in another town. We finally get settled in enough to start sleeping there. The dream is forgotten and all is well.

We have one final trip to make to our old house to get the rest of our things. Pulling up, we can see that something has gone wrong. There are ambulances, firetrucks, and police cars stationed everywhere. My parents storm out of the car and demand to know what happened. All of us are led to the backyard. Apparently, lightning had struck the tree and caused it to fall on the house behind ours. The dream comes flooding back.

I have not visited my old house since this experience.",,False,,t5_2tcwa,False,,,True,t3_rz093,http://www.reddit.com/r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix/comments/rz093/i_watched_lightning_destroy_a_house_before_it/,

The other ones I've come across are relatively minor that are strange yet explainable for the most part. But this one takes the cake. 

One day my friend and I were in a heavily populated mall-type area at Dundas Square in downtown Toronto (the building with the AMC and Future Shop in it, for any Torontonians here). We've grown up around Toronto all our lives and used to go downtown almost every weekend; safe to say we know the area, and that building, quite well. As you walk into the building, the ground floor is the ticket booth for the AMC (which is actually on the top floor of the building) and the elevators. There are two escalators leading up to the second floor, one going up and one going down. The second floor is a Future Shop. Right beside the first set of escalators were (past tense is key here) another set of two, one up and one down. The third floor is a food court. 

My friend and I get to the top of the second set of escalators onto the third floor food court, and she spots a friend of hers from work, so we stop and chat for a few minutes. Then we get some food and sit down to eat. As we go to leave, we walk toward the escalators and notice something odd - there is only one escalator, the one going up to the food court. The down escalator simply was not there. We stood there, completely dumbfounded. 

So we tried to logically work out the situation, saying perhaps they'd moved the escalator or something, but there were absolutely no signs of recent construction or anything. My friend then pointed out that people were going up *and* down the escalators while we were standing near them talking to her friend from work. I too remember seeing people go both up and down. After several minutes of standing there by the up escalator with our mouths agape like idiots, two women approached us.

""Looking for the down escalator?"" 
""Yeah, did they move it or something?""
""No. It's on the other side of the food court there--"" and one of the women pointed to the other side of the food court, where lo and behold, the down escalator was. ""Are you guys from here?""
""Yes, we've been here countless times before... We could SWEAR the down escalator was right here. We're not crazy, are we?""
(This part blew our minds even more)
""No, you're not crazy. In fact we've been here for about an hour and you guys are the sixth set of people who've been standing here confused about how to get downstairs. It's as though everyone seemed to think the down escalator *should* be here, but isn't, and never was.""

My friend and I then went across the food court to get downstairs, neither of us having any recollection of ever having to go across the food court to get down. The fact that there was no construction or anything of the kind was just completely baffling. As far as anyone could tell, the escalator has always been there. Her and I both shrugged off the experience to avoid feeling completely insane, but it still weirds me out to this day.

Maybe, maybe not.",122,23,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix/comments/1i52jv/a_glitched_goodbye_maybe_maybe_not/,"This is my first time posting in this subreddit, so if you feel it doesn't fit here just let me know. Sorry, the story is a little long.   

Back in 2009 my grandfather was diagnosed with lung cancer. The doctors believed since the cancer was caught earlier on my grandfather's chances of beating this horrid malady were quite favorable. Such was not the case, and by February of 2011 he was nearing the end of his exhausting battle.  

On March 3, 2011 I went to visit my grandfather in the hospital as I routinely did. Towards the end of my stay, my grandmother informed me that the doctors had said he only had a few more weeks to live. Deeply saddened, I wrapped up my visit, told my grandfather good night and that I'd be back to see him tomorrow. As soon as I stepped out the door I was overcome with the feeling that that would be the last time I saw him. I tried to shake the feeling off as a reaction to the terrible news my grandmother had delivered right before I left, but by the time I reached the elevator the sensation that I had to go back and see him one last time was so unbearably strong I couldn't ignore it. Running back down the hall to his room, sobbing like some hysterical lunatic, I threw my arms around him and told him I loved him. After awhile, I said my goodbyes and again made another (this time successful) attempt to leave, even though the feeling still remained.  

After such a trying day, I got home and went straight to bed. I was awoken hours later from a dead sleep to a very strange, seemingly loud ""POP!"" noise. I have no idea if this sound was part of a dream I was having, or if the noise was a more profound signal, but this was what caused me to awaken. As soon as I sat up and shook the grogginess away, I knew in that moment my grandfather had made his exit from this earthly plain. I grabbed my cell phone and looked at the time. . . 5:03 AM. I laid awake for several minutes before drifting back to sleep.  

That morning I received a call from my grandmother. Before she could say anything, I asked her if my grandfather had passed and if it happened at 5:03 AM. Sounding surprised, she asked if my father had already called and informed me. I told her no and relayed my experience from the previous night.  

Could this have been my grandfather's way of ""glitching"" some sort of last goodbye to me, even in death?

This will be a long post. I've been keeping this one to myself for several years. This happened to my best friend, and he never mentioned it until we were about 17-19. I will start off by saying that I am a skeptic in every sense of the word. Enough so, that I often don't trust anyone on just their word. All I can say is that I trust my friend and believe his story. 

I will be including some drawings throughout this story, and I apologize for the quality. I'm sorry if it takes away from the story for some of you, but the diagrams were used when the story was told to me. 

My friend, Dean, and his older brother Hank were staying overnight at their regular babysitter's house, as their mother was out of town. They slept in the basement, which to my understanding was a basic finished basement with a bedroom off of it. The bedroom belonged to the babysitter's son, who was in his mid teens. Dean was 6, his brother Hank was older, about 8. The boys were sleeping in front of the television in their sleeping bags. 

[THIS](http://i.imgur.com/HlDXKFS.jpg) is the layout of the room. Dean is the red X, while his brother hank is the blue. As you can see in the picture, there wasn't much to the room. One door, to the babysitter's son's room. Two windows to the backyard. Television, couch ect. 

Dean wakes up in the middle of the night, only to realize that the room is pitch black. This confused him, because not only did he fall asleep in front of a lit television, but he was used to a mild amount of light shining through the windows, even at night. He called to his brother, ""Hank? Are you awake?"". Hank answers, ""Yeah. And I can't see anything. Are your eyes stuck?"" Dean then realizes that he physically has his eyes shut, and that he can't pry them open. They both tug at their eyes with no success. ""Hank, where are you?"", Dean asks. ""I don't know, let's feel around till we find eachother."" The boys both feel around, and Dean realizes he is either in front of, or behind the couch. ""I'm at the couch."", he calls to Hank. He can hear Hank shuffling around and knows he's near. The boys reach out to each other and Dean feels Hank feel for his arm.

The moment they touch each other, they realize they are no longer next to each other somehow. He said it was like time blinked. ""Dean! Where'd you go?!"", Hank calls to him. ""I don't know, I thought you were right next to me. I was at the couch."" They begin to feel around again. At this point, Dean determined they had both ended up [HERE](http://i.imgur.com/EyQCpyL.jpg).

They crawl around and feel for each other until they both near the same corner of the room. Again, they touch each other and are somehow instantly ""blinked"" to another part of the room. This time, they determine they are about [HERE](http://i.imgur.com/0pUgDE9.jpg). At this point, they both begin to yell for the babysitter's son, Greg, who was asleep in his bedroom. They yell, but he doesn't come, so they repeat the process of shuffling and searching for each other. They find each other again, though he doesn't recall where. With one more touch, they are again in different spots of the room. 

Dean feels along the wall and realizes he's towards the bottom of the stairs. ""Hank, where are you now?"" ""I don't know, but I'm stuck in something. I can't move."" 

Dean now knows he's [HERE](http://i.imgur.com/B2Tbtev.jpg) but he doesn't know where Hank is. Panicked, he feels along the wall and knocks down the picture that was hanging on the wall at the bottom of the stairs. He feels his way over to Greg's bedroom. He begins screaming and banging on the door as hard as he can. 

Greg opens his bedroom door, and with that, Dean experienced the most blinding burst of light he'd ever experienced. As his eyes adjust to the light and his surroundings, he tries to explain what has been happening. Greg dismisses it as a bad dream, but asks where Hank is. ""Here! I'm over here."", Hank calls out. Greg follows Hank's voice. 

Greg found Hank [HERE](http://i.imgur.com/gviReMp.jpg), behind a nearly 5 and a half foot tall dresser, wedged into the corner. Dean watched as Greg had to physically climb/bend over and pick Hank up from behind the bureau. It would have taken quite of bit of effort for Hank to have climbed up and over that dresser, especially in the dark, and I'm not sure if he could have even done it on his own. After trying to calm the boys down, and dismissing the events as just ""boys being boys and playing around"", Greg put the boys back to bed. They finally manage to fall asleep. 

Morning comes and things feel normal. The babysitter calls the boys up for breakfast as Dean remembers what happened that night. ""I had a really weird dream last night."", he tells Hank. ""Yeah, me too. I'm still pretty tired from it."" As they approach the stairs, Dean notices the broken photo, lying in pieces on the floor. 

From what I was told, the boys both agreed it was just ""really weird"" and they don't think much about it in their adult life. Dean is telling me this story, ever so nonchalantly, as me and two nearly grown men are almost in tears hearing it. I have neither a rational nor an irrational explanation for what happened, but I definitely still think about it from time to time. Thanks to anyone who read through this, and I'm sorry if it belongs in nosleep instead. I'll answer any questions that I can. 

**TLDR****; Friend and his brother were temporarily blinded by an unknown force and transported to different parts of the room every time they touched.** (admittedly bad TLDR)

Jenny has had experience working with adults with accents so she understood him, but I still found it strange with his accent.  After his sub was prepared, I cashed him out and he left.

Approximately half an hour later, I saw him come back in through the door, and as I was closer, I took the order.  Again, he ordered the rib with his accent making it still sound like ""Crisp"".  I thought that perhaps he had dropped it at home, or another person wanted a rib or whatever the excuse may be to ordering the same sub again.  

  After the order was done and he left, I turned to Jenny and said, I almost couldn't understand his accent even though he already ordered the rib.  ""When did he order the rib?"" Jenny asked me.  I had a confused look as I reminded her she took his order like half an hour ago.  She denied any memory of serving him.  I checked the cash register, nothing.

Well it suddenly stopped barking, and turned back and went under the bush. I stopped where I was on the sidewalk and looked up, and saw above me another Earth. In the sky, as clear as could be, I saw a mirror image of the planet. I recognized the landmasses, and it was rotating slowly. I want to go into more detail, but I don't know how. Close enough for me to not be able to see the entirety of it at once, but far enough away that it wasn't blocking sunlight and the atmospheric perspective was obvious, there was a mirror image of Earth in the sky.

1373465288.0,97,self.Glitch_in_the_Matrix,1i0a7q,The time I was executed.,131,34,44,http://www.reddit.com/r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix/comments/1i0a7q/the_time_i_was_executed/,"About 10 years ago I took a bus trip to Boston to visit a high school friend named Bill. We ended up going to Worchester, Massachusetts to visit another high school friend. I had brought an ounce of magic mushrooms with me and it was going to be split between 4 - 6 people. Since they were all friends and I wasn't making anyone pay, I naturally gave myself the biggest pile when dividing them. It was at least 1.5 the other piles.

When I took the bus to Boston, I had to wake up very early, because I was leaving from the DC area. I ended up staying up all night instead of waking up at 3am. When the bus hit NYC, we had 20 minutes to eat and I stupidly decided to stay in the bus instead of rushing around the city for a slice of pizza. I think it was the sleep-deprivation.

By the time I arrived in Worchester and ate my pile of mushrooms, I had been awake for almost 40 hours straight, running purely on the excitement of being with friends I hadn't seen since high school. I had not eaten in around 16 hours, we immediately ordered chinese, but I stupidly ate the mushrooms first. 

After about 15 minutes I could feel them. And I was a mushroom-veteran so I knew this was unheard of. I had tripped on mushrooms maybe 20 times in my life before that night.

The first thing that happened was Bill freaked out. I gave him the second biggest pile and after eating them he informed me that he had never tripped and had only smoked weed once or twice. I immediately realized I was going to have to watch his back.

About 2 hours in, Bill was flopping around on the floor like a fish out of water and asking who he was. But was otherwise fine, health-wise. A couple of high school friends who just happened to be coincidentally driving through Massachusetts called and joined the reunion. As soon as they entered, I got the weirdest sense of dread. I cannot explain it in words, but it literally felt like death had entered the room.

I went to my friend Bill and told him we should go hang out in his car and listen to music. He was on another planet entirely and kept resisting. I was trying to explain to him that something sinister was afoot and he just didn't seem to get it. I ended up trying to grab his keys and he really got paranoid after that about letting me close to him. I ended up basically saying ""Every man for himself then"" and grabbing my stuff to exit the apartment.

When I gathered my stuff the others wanted to know what the hell I was doing. I just kept slowly backing towards the exit while making confusing small talk about getting fresh air. They asked why I had grabbed my backpack if I was just going out for a minute. I bolted.

One of my friends actually ran after me and caught me in the hallway. I was pressing the elevator button and they were staring at me from the doorway asking what the hell was wrong with me. I can't tell you why but I knew I had to get the fuck out of there. So I immediately bolted from my friend down the steps. 

I don't know whether he chased me or if it was the mushrooms, but I heard running behind me and ended up running down like 18 flights like a lunatic running for his life. I hit the street and bolted into traffic. I flagged a taxi and asked them to drive me multiple states away. I was kicked out the taxi.

I ended up asking a couple girls to use their cellphone and things went bad somehow and these two guys started chasing me to kick my ass. So I began to run again thinking the whole world was out to get me. I was running recklessly in any direction and ended up in the ghetto. It was bad, man.

I ran over to an all night parking lot and begged the guy inside to let me use the phone, my tripping brain was telling me my life was in danger and then I literally dialed 911. The police operator answered and ended up sending the cops.

I ended up getting put into the back of the cop car and this is where the things took a seriously dark turn. The police began to talk about the fact that I was a stain to society. They began to drive outside of the city and I was really freaking out because we were now in a suburban/rural area. The police were getting angrier and angrier throughout their conversation about ""lowlifes"" and ended up making some kind of weird agreement. It is important to note that I was completely calm and cooperated fully the moment the cops showed up.

The pulled onto a dirt road and drove deep into a forested area, then parked, pulled me out of the car still handcuffed and one cop put me against a tree while the other cop pulled out his gun. Before I could even fight back or resist, I could feel the steel on my temple and then the man pulled the trigger. 

I was dead. Experiencing the 3rd party view of my body slumped against a tree.

I distinctly remember thinking ""Wow, so life is more complicated and amazing than humans think, I am still hearing my thoughts, I am in my spirit form, a God/afterlife does exist.""

And then I was in a magical forest of some kind. And then I was in the desert. And then I was in another environment. I was just flashing through landscapes, always with some form of awareness. 

I remember seeing a waterfall and actually reaching out to see if I was hallucinating/dreaming or if I could ""feel"" the water. I felt the liquid running all over my (hand?).

Then I was suddenly awake. I was in a hospital. I had literally torn an IV tube and water was running all over my hand.

The nurses were nice and said I was one of the best patients they had. I was apparently brought by police into a ""calm down"" room because the police also agreed that I was just a good kid who took too many mushrooms. That is what the nurses told me. It was weird because I mentioned the parking lot and they told me ""No, the police found you in a convenience store smiling and shaking hands with people, saying you were in heaven and they all must be angels.""

To this day I do not know if:

* I completely hallucinated my death

* Two cops decided to fuck with me and actually pretended to kill me before dropping me off at a hospital

* It all really happened like I remember it and I experienced a glitch

I would stay with my nana once or twice a month. This particular weekend, she was in hospital recovering from a fall and I had offered to stay and look after her two dogs. It was about 10pm. I had just finished watching tv and felt like finishing the evening by having a nice hot bath. I smoked a J and ran myself a bath.

Now, this bathroom had one of those noisy extractor fans because it didn't have any windows. It would stay on for roughly 10-15 minutes once the light has been turned off. I light a candle, close my eyes and begin relaxing in the bath...just waiting for this rattling extractor fan to turn off so I could fully relax. Now, as soon as it turns off and stops making noise, I immediately feel this rush of dread and alienation - I immediately flop out of the bath like a fish on a boat deck and attempt to tug the light back on. I don't make it to the light because I'm now somehow 10ft up the ceiling looking down at myself with my eyes closed. Everything was in HD, I could see every minute detail in everything. I could feel the presence of the two dogs, plants and the people in neighbouring houses. I could see &amp; feel energy. I was everything! All of a sudden, I'm tingling from head to toe and right back in the bath feeling at one with the universe. This all happened in the space of 5-10 seconds.

This cured my depression.

One night, recently, I experienced sleep paralysis (nothing unusual). Then it felt like someone was trying to lift me -- forcibly -- out of my body. It hurt. I also felt I couldn't breath, so I panicked and struggled to get free. I got one ar arm ""out"".... and I flailed the other in a panic... smacking my husband in the face, and waking us both up. 

I settled back to bed, fell asleep again, and experienced the paralysis yet again. And yet again something was pulling me out of my body. This time I relaxed and didn't panic. Still, it hurt. A lot. First one arm was free, then the other, then my chest, and next my head -- that part hurt the most -- with rest of body following...

Next thing I know, I'm out on my street. Moonlit night, no clouds. I figure I am dreaming and I tell myself why not try to fly? If it's a dream, this should be a piece of cake... I have flown in dreams before... 

So I spread my arms and launch myself toward the moon.... and I'm up in the air... then SMACK... I run into the telephone wires and fall back to the ground. 

Humbled, I practice flying, but only a few feet above the ground. Up and down the street. Then I go back and climb into my body.

The next morning, my husband brings me coffee in bed. He brings up my smacking him in the face. I relate all of this to him, my dream. He turns pale white... he says, ""Get up. Look outside the window.... ""

There's a Verizon truck on the street. The telephone wire had come down in the night....

I ask him, ""Wind?"" He says, ""No, it was clear night, no wind at all... no tree limbs... no reason for it to have fallen down... ""

In Korea, most of the people live in apartments, but my grandparents lived in a huge house on the countryside. There were so many things to explore, like random storage rooms on walls that you'd need a stepladder to get into. 

One day, I was alone with my grandma. And I realized that I'd never gone to the rooftop. So I asked her if I can go, all excitedly, but my grandma had a straight face on and said, ""You shouldn't go there because the door will disappear"". As a kid, I just laughed it off and thought she was joking, but now that I think about it, the fact that she wasn't smiling and that she said it in such a dead tone freaks me out now. She's normally very energized and smiling. 

I ignored what she said and went towards the entrance to the rooftop. She didn't stop me. I remember going up the concrete stairs, feeling the cool air, and the ringing sound of my steps against the concrete. It's all vivid, I even remember seeing a big, dead yellow-striped spider and avoiding it. 

Finally, I reached the door, and opened it. The rooftop was huge, and I could see the bright blue sky and clouds. There were big Korean pots lining the low, open walls. I enjoyed myself there, seeing the neighborhood, and I wondered why my grandmother was being a little mean about me coming here. Then, I turned around to go back. I looked around again, confused. The door was gone. Instead, there was an empty wall where it should've been. I looked around 360 degrees, but I only found 4 walls and the Korean pots. I was so scared and confused and angry at my grandmother for not stopping me.  I kept pacing back and forth, screaming downwards in hopes that my grandma would hear. I even contemplated suicide. Then I just sat down against the wall facing the wall where the door should have been, and started crying against my knees.

After what seemed like forever (probably 30 minutes of this), I looked up from my knees and *fuck*. The door was there. Right in front of me. I was so aghast at this point, I just ran up to the door in case it disappeared again, and ran down the concrete stairs. I remembered seeing the yellow spider again, and avoided it, finally coming to the original floor. I ran to my grandmother screaming and crying, and she seemed back to normal as well. She was all grandmotherly again, and loving and kind, and completely changed. She gave me a piggy back ride, trying to calm me down. 

I never talked to her about it until maybe 5 years later, when I went back to Korea. She said she doesn't remember the situation, and that she never knew about the disappearing door. I couldn't even go back to the rooftop, because they had renovated it since. ",,False,,t5_2tcwa,False,,,True,t3_1g7alv,http://www.reddit.com/r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix/comments/1g7alv/door_glitch/,

When I was about 13 years old, I was home watching my younger brother and sister. Out of nowhere I had this looming feeling that something terrible happened to my mom on her way home. It felt like a weird dream where I was watching her get into an accident at an intersection leading from a local shopping center in our town. Immediately I called my mom, but there was no answer. Being a young kid, I immediately feared the worst, and start having a headache. Moments later the house phone rang and it was from her phone. I answered the phone and immediately said, ""Mom! Are you alright?!"" My mom quickly responded, ""Thankfully! I heard my phone rang and when I went to grab it I swerved into the other lane, but when I did that some jackass on the other side of the rode came into my lane. If I didn't swerve by mistake I would have been hit by an oncoming car."" I paused, stunned at what she said. ""Imhometakemedrunk, why did you ask if I was alright?"" ""I don't know, mom. I...I just thought something horrible happened and had to check on you."" Too this day my mom is convinced I can see things before they happen. But this wasn't the nail in the coffin for that belief of hers. This next story is.

This took place when I was maybe 11-12 years old, right as my parents were getting separated. About once a week I would wake up sweating from a terrible reoccuring nightmare and immediately go to my moms room to tell her about it. (Yes guys, I used to be a mommas boy...) In this dream I would be walking down a set of wooden stairs with a wooden banister. The walls were covered in a floral pattern wallpaper with family pictures littering the wall. Each time I looked at the pictures, everyones face was blurry. I could never make out anyone in the pictures, the only thing that stood out was the frames. These cheap golden thin frames that were all falling apart and looked very tacky. At the bottom of the stairs there was a door in front of you that led to the back yard and a doorway to the left that led to the kitchen. As soon as I would turn to the kitchen I was filled with terror, almost piss myself, and then wake up sweating. This happened for several months. Neither myself or my mother could ever make sense of it. After several months of these dreams happening, my mom received a call from one of her few close friends that she wanted us (my mom, myself, brother and sister) to come visit her at her new house that her and her boyfriend just moved into. Nobody really wanted to drive an hour out there just to stop by, but since my moms friend had a very cute daughter around my age I begged us to go. So we all got there and were hanging out upstairs in the kids room while my moms friend and her boyfriend were downstairs talking. My mom was with all of us looking at their rooms and catching up. I wanted something to drink so I decided to go downstairs for some soda. As I rounded the first turn of the stairwell, I was struck with the worst case of deja vu. It was the stairwell from my dream. Same picture frames, same door, same wallpaper. Instantly I felt dread. I did NOT want to go down those stairs into the kitchen in fear of what might be in there. As I was about to turn around I hear a ""WHACK"" come from the kitchen and what sounded like gentle sobbing. I decided to investigate and as I rounded the corner, there was my moms friend, getting the shit beaten out of her by her boyfriend. I gasped and they heard me and looked over. The boyfriend shouted at me and went after me, so I hauled add up those stairs towards my mom. I screamed for her to help and she caught him coming after me. We immediately called the cops on him and he was arrested for domestic abuse. Apparently this had been going on for over a year and none of her kids or herself said a word to anyone in fear of being killed by this maniac. Had I not witnessed it myself, I may have continued on until my moms friend or one or her kids was dead. This, was the moment my mom thought that I must he psychic.

I swear this is 100% true. 

So about 7 or 8 years ago on Christmas day, me and my two sisters each got a brand new shiny iPod classic, 32GB, and on the back of them was each of our individual names engraved into the surface. I got a black one, and both of my sisters got theirs in white. I was around 12 at the time, and my sisters were 15 &amp; 17. We were obviously extremely happy with these, as we weren't used to getting such expensive gifts from Santa. We loved and cared for these for many years - they were undoubtedly our most prized possession at the time. We used them solidly for at least 3 years, but technology continues to improve and we kept up with the improvements, and eventually their use started to diminish.

So whilst on holiday the other day, the iPod Christmas gift came up, and we were talking about how cool they were to have, and how good they were at the time. The glitch, however, is that my sister reveals to us that now she has not one, but TWO of the SAME iPod. She swore they were the same colour, same model, same exact freaking iPod. Even down to having her name engraved on the back of both copies, something unique to each of the iPods.

My sister says she only realised that she in fact had two of the same iPod, when she returned to my parents house just before the holiday and found a duplicate of the one that she had taken with her when she moved out. She said she thought she had just forgotten to take it with her, until she presents a few days later the second ""copy"" of the iPod upon returning to her home after the holiday.

My first thoughts were that someone just thought they had lost her iPod and secretly got a replacement, before the original was found again. However none of my family own up to doing this, and what's more, the music on both iPod's are exactly the same.

There is a $15 fee for becoming a member, and I had set back the money for the fee so I could be in the show.

Two days before the fee was due, I had to spend that money on groceries and medicine, and I was completely broke.

The day before the fee is due, I get a random call from someone I don't know, asking if I could fix their computer issues. I agreed, and He brought over his wife's computer, mentioning that my landlady had recommended me. (My landlady did not know I hadn't paid the entry fee to the art show or that I needed the money.)

I fixed his computer pretty quick, so I was only going to ask for $10. He insisted on more and gave me $15. The same amount I needed for the entry fee.

I paid the entry fee and put up my work, and attended the opening night which was pretty packed. I got a lot of compliments on my artwork while I was there, and I might even be able to sell some.

Then tonight, My wife was visiting our landlady and found this out:
 
The morning before I had to pay my fee, my landlady's phone rang at ~6am, waking her up. When she answered, A woman on the other end said, ""Hello? Can I help you?"" to which my landlady responded, ""Um, You called me."" The woman on the other end recognized my landlady's voice and said, ""No, my phone was ringing..."". Neither had actually initiated the phone call.

Then, after they had talked for a while, in the background, the woman's husband said, ""Ask if she knows someone who can fix computers!"" and my landlady happily gave them my information. This is how I ended up having the guy come to me to fix his wife's computer.

So apparently I'm supposed to be in this show and keep working on my art.

I have no idea how to sum this craziness up in a tl;dr...

&gt;I am writing to you with a warning. There will be a moment in the next month. You will know it when you see it. You will have a glimpse of something that will stir you to your soul. You won't know what it means. I'm telling you to heed that feeling. It could be a slight sweat you break into. It could be a little tingle in the tip of your dick. It could be a mild nausea that you attribute to the beef carpaccio at Tapateria. In reality it is a moment that will change your mind forever. If I tell you it might change the way everything works out. Remember that time that we watched that space show with Denis. Yeah, it's like that.

Most of the time this one friend who has a car drive each us to each of our houses if he can. 

Some years ago, this guy, a mutual female friend and I were in the girl's house and it was time to go because it was very late. My friend didn't have his car, the girl didn't want to drive (she wasn't good at driving, specially at night) and gave her car to my friend so he could drop me in my house, get to his house, and then she would drive back to hers. 

We took an old avenue that leads straight to my house, and is one of the oldest of the town where I live in. We passed two blocks and we found the road closed, there was a huge hole on the ground, surrounded by wooden planks, and with lots of dirt around blocking the way. This is not unusual here, because there's always some public pipes to repair. My friend decided to make a right turn, then turn left two times, going around the block to keep the original path. 

When we were back in the avenue, we heard a car very close, we turned our heads back to where we thought the hole was and there was a car going very fast in the opposite way of the street, we kept looking just waiting to see the worst, because we thought it was going to fall into the hole but nothing happened, the car kept going until the beginning of the avenue and then turned so we lost sight of it. 

We were astonished! There was no hole, no dirt, no wooden planks, nothing. We kept looking back for a few minutes in total disbelief, the rest of the street was empty. We put ourselves together and my friend kept driving. 

To this day we don't know what happened that night, we all know what we saw, no one was driking, hallucinating or almost sleeping. Everything we saw first just vanished.

The one thing that's sure is thanks to that glitch we didn't crash into that car, which looked very real and was driving towards us. ",,False,,t5_2tcwa,False,,,True,t3_1jwm3a,http://www.reddit.com/r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix/comments/1jwm3a/a_very_fortunate_glitch_but_still_no_explanation/,

It's a high adventure base in New Mexico where you get to do awesome 10 day backpacking adventures, and it was pretty awesome.  Some of my friends were in a different troop then me and they also went that summer.  Their trek ended two days before mine started so we missed seeing each other there.

When we got there I called my parents to tell them how much fun I was having, and called my best friend who had just gotten back for any tips on hiking the trails and stuff.  My friend answers with ""oh thank god you're alive"".  He goes on to tell me that his troop was at mass the last day before they left (the day before I arrived) and the priest asked if anyone had intention to pray for.  This was pretty normal at scout masses and usually people called out the names of sick friends and relatives and recently deceased people.  When his troop was at mass someone called out ""[my name] deceased"".

So that's a little creepy and all, but my name is somewhat common, so it wasn't that big a deal.  My friend goes on to tell me that the troop these guys were from who had called out my name was the same troop number as mine.  Creepier but whatever.  My friend is glad I'm ok.

So we do our trek and I come home, and my friend has done some research (we were 14 and really had very little to do in the summer).  Bear in mind this was over a decade ago and the resources now on the internet weren't all available then.  He had called up the council (the regional scouting office, usually a few counties-ish in size) that these guys had belonged to, and gotten the number for their scoutmaster.

The town they were chartered in had the same name as our home town.  That's really weird.  My friend calls up the scout leader and tells him the whole story, offers his condolences and says how strange it was, chats a bit and it ends up with this guy mailing my friend a copy of the local paper with this guy's obituary in it.

The newspaper got there a few days after I got back and I looked it over with my friend.  The guy had the same middle initial as me too, but was an older man.  What was really creepy was that his siblings had the same names as mine (mentioned in his obit) and it seemed like they had similar gaps in age.  Any of these things independently might be strange, but put together there's something up with it.

No clue if my stories will fit in as a few of them get a bit creepy, but I think they would do better here then in r/nosleep. Please tell me if I am wrong and I will fix it.

Anyway this is my glitch. When I was around 8 - 10 years old, for a full year I had some strange occurrences. Some I remember, a few were I thought nothing of it till I talked to my parents. 

The first one I remember very well and is one of my favorite stories to tell.

I was was just doing what normal kids do on a weekend morning, watching cartoons. Everyone else was asleep, so trying to be quite I had the volume down and was sitting way to close to the TV. It was a warm morning, I remember because I was leaning on the fire place as the bricks were nice and cool.

Everything was great, I was a bit in a daze because I had not slept well the night before, as was normal for me. (when I was younger I had HORRIBLE insomnia and would some times stay awake for 2 days or more) When all of a sudden I felt something was off. Its nothing I can place, just kind of like something with the air is wrong. 

Then I have a overwhelming urge to move, no clue why, but I decide not to fight it. So I move a few feet to the left away from the fire place and the wonderful chill of the stones. I settle down in my new and sadly not as cool spot when no more then a minute later I hear a crack and a large smashing noise.

I jump, because hello large noise to my right. Right where I had been sitting now has glass shards everywhere. A large painting, easily larger then me, has fallen were I had been sitting. It fell with such a force that some of the shards have made it near me.

Surprisingly enough I was not freaked, not even scared. (Other then the first hay look loud noise scare)

No clue how bad that would have hurt me, but with the way I was sitting my neck would have been exposed.  

Luckily my parents believed me about it just falling down, even though I know it was pretty secure and there was no reason for it to have fallen. (That and I loved that painting, we saved it and its now leaning on the wall in another room)

Anyway, its not as big as my other stories of that year, but it is one my favorites as its the one I remember so clearly. 


Tell me if you all want to hear more. If not I will still post one more as its by far the creepiest, yet kind of cool story from my childhood. It involves cats, I know you internet people LOVE cats.

I was there, and then to them it seemed i had been kidnapped. My dad ended up driving through the neighborhood looking on the side of the road, in ditches, etc.

All I remember after falling asleep in my sister's room was dazily walking down the stairs. My dad and mom and sister swear they tore every room upstairs apart. While screaming, calling, shouting my name. Threatening me if I didn't show up. I recall none of this.

My dad still swears up and down I was NOT in the house. Last weekend I boarded a plane, and while going through security, something sent off the radar on my head. My head was patted. They do that when the metal detector senses it on your head. To my knowledge i have zero metal headware.

So, my girlfriend and I were driving through a heavily forested area in Tasmania, Australia. There is a cliff wall on our left hand side and a cliff edge to the right of us. The road is winding and fairly thin, so vehicles need to slow down to a crawl when passing on each other.

I've noticed a yellow camper-van approaching us. My girlfriend casually mentions ""watch out..."". We are both watching the van as we slowly approach one another. We are about 20 meters away from it when the curve in the road (and the cliff face) obscures the van from view. When we pass the corner... the van is gone!

Both my girlfriend look at each other shocked and we are both freaked out! I took a pen from the hire car's glove compartment and, without speaking, write ""yellow camper-van"" on one of my maps... I then ask my girlfriend to describe what she saw. She describes it as a ""yellow camper-van that vanished"".

There was nowhere for the van to go. I couldn't have gone off the cliff because of the trees and we would have seen it anyway. It couldn't have turned around and sped off because it was only out of view for two seconds...

I would have discounted this as a hallucination or imagination or false memory... but we witnessed the same thing!

I'm certain it wasn't a false memory because I took the precaution of noting what I saw for that reason. I did this mainly because I am someone who has never experienced anything strange and I felt compelled to attempt to verify it.

I just wanted to share this. I feel confident that we witnessed something very unusual and unexplainable.

It's weird because I haven't really spoken about this (apart from /r/Paranormal) with my friends or family before... it was just weird.

On our receipts, there's a section for ""Tip ___"" ""Total ___"" and ""Signature ___"". The customer leaves their total and then signs.

On my second to last delivery, the man who signed it (who's name was Dave on the receipt) wrote ""$0.00"" on the tip, wrote his total, and signed. So I got no tip that delivery. I was mad. But what was interesting was the way he wrote it. Again, I have taken thousands of deliveries. Thousands! And never has anyone taken the effort to write ""$0.00"". Ever. I check every delivery to see if I get a tip. Usually it's just a dash, a ""0"", or blank if they aren't feeling courteous. But this guy wrote ""$0.00"".

So I head back to the store, expecting that to be my last delivery for the night. But I had one more. To another Dave, which was sort of interesting, but it was on the other side of town. So I go there. And this Dave, a black man (the other Dave was white) ALSO takes the time to write ""$0.00"". 

Nobody has ever written ""$0.00"" for me in the tip section before, out of thousands of deliveries. Now two men named Dave write that on the same night?

She said she woke me when I started screaming and apparently (I was in a 'just woke up stupor') I told her I saw planes crashing into a building.

My mum tossed it off as a bad dream. The next day at school, my kindy teacher asked the class to draw a picture of whatever they wanted. I remember exactly what I drew. My teacher held it up to the class. She told everyone about how it looked great and so real. I got a merit for it. 

The next day passes, nothing out of the ordinary, when I come home the news is on and it's broadcasting that the events of September 11th had occurred. 
To this day I remember the looks from the teacher I got the next day. She took back my merit and did not show me any exclusive attention.

I forgot all about this saga, until a couple of years ago, when I found my drawing book from kindy. In it are drawings you'd expect of a 5 year old. Stick figures, very poor illustrations and drawings I can't even describe. 

But there was one that was drawn as if I drew it today. The level of detail it had was immense. The number of windows on the building. The amount of planes. The fire. The date on the top right hand corner was Sept 10 2001. I had drawn four planes, two circling a building, one crashing into it and one flying in another direction.


I don't know if this is the right place to post it, but that dream and the events afterwards, I just can't explain it.

**Edit I have found the drawing, but I mistook the date. It's the 12th September 2001. However since I am in Australia, the events of 9/11 were not broadcast. So apart from the dates mentioned above and the level of detail of the drawing, everything else is completely true. I will be able to upload it when I get home in two hours.**

Edit 2: OP delivers, I apologise if I misled anyone about the picture, but that's just what I remember.

Sometimes it would be some freak misunderstanding where it turned out she never actually died, just went missing, and sometimes she was just there without explanation. I'm the exact opposite of a lucid dreamer, my dreams are ridiculous and have no point, but it never seems ridiculous to me while I'm in the dream, so seeing my mother was never weird until I woke up and thought about it. 

About a year ago I had a moment of clarity, however. In my dream me and my Mom were just sitting there talking and i suddenly realized, wait you're dead, this can't be real you died a long time ago. She said ""I know"" or something like that and I woke up. She hasn't shown up in any of my dreams since.

Now here's my glitch:
The past 2 weeks I have been on holiday in benidorm, Spain. Last saturday I left by bus back to the Netherlands but from the moment I stepped into the bus I had this weird gut feeling.

I hadn't slept much the night before and hoped to get some sleep in the bus which wasn't the case because I still had that eerie feeling. that night around 5AM we entered southern france through spain and I finally managed to fall asleep.
now I don't remember many details but I dreamed of a bus like the one I was travelling in crashing. It went trough the guardrail and tumbled down a long way. I woke up drenched in sweat as I remember feeling the fear of the people in the bus. So I woke up and everything was okay but the feeling in my gut was gone and I was still a but puzzled about that very vivid dream.
I mean I could re-tell alot of details I otherwise would have never remembered (2 people died, white bus, line of trees by the side, somewhere in france I thought, bus company was something with europe I thought)
I passed it off as just a nightmare and around 2ish in the afternoon we finally arrive in the netherlands. 
the radio switched to a dutch frequency and they were broadcasting the news. 
ofcourse they tell of a bus accident in southern france that killed 2 people and injured many. they said the bus went trough the guardrail and tumbled down a hill. 

I remember the fear I felt in that...dream. I remember screams and people's faces. I remember being scared myself so very clearly but I wasn't on that bus. and the company which I thought to be something with europe? It's euroliner.

I think it was a vision or something. or it runs in the family cause my aunt told me she had a vision or dream once of a plane crashing and later on the news they told of a plane crash and she could re tell every single detail. something spiritual maybe?

   I was at a Gas Station. The person in front of me for the cashier was taking a LONG time. I needed to be home for dinner by 6:00. I checked my watch. ""4:67."" ""Whaaa...?"" I figured the watch was glitched. I turned to the person behind me and asked for the time. She said, ""4:68.""

After awhile, I became suddenly tired. Then suddenly, my eyes open like I had been asleep. I checked the time. ""5:16."" I thought it was a dream. But just then, I got a reply from a text I sent my wife during the ""Dream.""

I first noticed it when I was at a slumber party and the girl lying next to me said ""stop moving"" (please note this is not sleepwalking as someone suggested, I am fully aware of what is happening, fully awake and I can allow or disallow the movements at will) . Basically what happens is that my body begins to move on it's own. I will actually turn over, bend my legs, get up and walk, etc (not normally, mind you, my husband says I look like a zombie/possessed person) Out of curiosity, I let it continue for awhile but stopped when ""it"" led me to my front door (I certainly wouldn't want to do this in public) - Again I'm am not doing this.

I live in Lawrence, KS and I drive often to Kansas City, MO (about an hour away) for concerts all the time. I'm also super bad at directions, so I usually use the GPS application on my phone once I leave the venue in Kansas City to get home. I've been going to concerts in Kansas City for six years, and I've always used the exact same route to get home each time. I set the application to avoid toll booths (because I'm cheap like that) so it's a few turns, then onto a highway which is a straight shot back to Lawrence.

Last Thursday (4/19), I was leaving a concert in Kansas City. It got over a bit earlier than usual (11 PM-ish) and started the drive home. It was the exact same route I've gone every single time, but this time I ended up in a town that I have never seen or been to before in my entire life. I don't remember exactly when I came into it or when I came out of it, but I vividly remember. It's not like the town was scary or anything, it was just a seemingly deserted town. It kind of reminded me of the smaller towns I'd drive through as I went to visit my grandparents in rural Missouri.

I actually made a Facebook status on my phone while I was in that town, joking around saying ""oh god, I think I ended up in Silent Hill!"" but I eventually came back into my town, in the exact same way I always did. It didn't really seem that weird to me at the time, and I thought nothing of it.

But tonight (4/26), I drove back from Kansas City again. Same exact GPS directions, and this time it was a normal drive. That's when it really clicked to me that something really strange happened last week. 

I did not go a different way on 4/19. There's really only one way to get from Kansas City to Lawrence, KS without using toll booths, and leaving Kansas City and entering Lawrence, KS were the same as all the other times.

One of my sisters had gotten my old room when I originally moved out so I was forced to sleep on a pull out couch/bed.

I felt an instant physical attraction to her and I knew she did felt the same for me. I don't know how I knew, I just did. Next thing I knew, the dream switches scenes and this girl and I are in a huge dark room.

The next morning, I check my phone and see I had I a voicemail. I look to see who it's from and it is says ""Unavailable."" ""Weird,"" I think to myself. I listen to the voicemail and I promise you this is what I heard. A woman was talking and this is what she said; verbatim:
""I had a really great time last night. We should do it again sometime. Call me.""

We typically went out every day and spent about 8-10 hours looking for weapon burial sites in order to destroy whatever was left there. We would check out an area for an hour or two and drive to a new location. My best friend was alone most of that day manning the mounted machine gun in the back of one of our Hummers. I had been riding in a different vehicle with most of my squad that day, but left and went to my friend's Hummer to hang out with him for awhile before we went to our last site for the day. 

The next site lay down one of the most dangerous routes for roadside bombs, but we had taken it hundreds of times in the past when it was impractical to find alternate routes. My friend's Hummer was third in the convoy that day, and it had five people in it, including me. The fourth Hummer had eleven people in it, which for a Hummer, is pretty jammed packed. The squad leader in charge of the fourth Hummer decided he wanted to take our spot in the convoy, and I got angry and told him no, and to get back into his own spot. I had no idea why I got angry at him, as it really doesn't matter which one of us was in the third position. I remember distinctly asking myself why the hell I just yelled at him, but shook it off and we started off to the last site.

As we were driving along, about halfway along our 20 minute trip, I get a strange feeling, and look up at my friend on the machine gun, who looks back at me at the same time. He had a puzzled look on his face, and I told him something didn't feel right. He said he had the exact same feeling, then looked back down the road. About 30 seconds later, starting to get more nervous, I said to him ""you ready to get blown up?"" and chuckled. He gave me a nervous, trying-to-shake-it-off laugh, then looked back down the road. Ten seconds later, he was killed and I had shrapnel down the left side of my body.

I was flown by helicopter up to the hospital in the region, and looked at my helmet which had a piece of shrapnel in the back, even though the blast had come from the front -diagonally- of the vehicle. I remembered that I had looked back at the last second at the fourth vehicle in the convoy, the one with eleven people in it. I then saw the Hummer, and realized that the exhaust pipe (which goes up the side of the Hummer) was nearly ripped off from a piece of shrapnel. My face had been right next to that pipe, but when I looked back I had turned away, saving my face from being blown off. 

Looking back on it all, when I turned back at the last second, effectively saving my face, that is frightening enough. Then, thinking about both my friend and I knowing we were going to get blown up got me too. My biggest memory will always be my last words to my friend, and I wish I could take them back. But the number one thing that gets me is that I, for no reason at all, yelled at the fourth Hummer driver to get back into his place in line. If his vehicle of eleven people were in our spot...

Myself and a few friends were regulars at a local semi pro Football team, and on match days would be allowed to hang around in the Bar and play an aeroplane shoot em up style video game and the pinball machine.

One day I remember being stood by them on my own, looking at the pinball machine and just knew that if I hit the coin reject button in a particular way I would get free credits.  I’d never seen anyone do it before, had never tried it before but just knew I could do it.

The coin reject button was a small metallic rod, about 3cm long and maybe 0.5cm wide. Using the bottom of the palm of my hand I hit it with a reasonable amount of force twice in very quick succession, and up popped a credit on the display.

I did it a few times, played a couple of games and eventually I remember getting it up very high, may have been 99 I think there were only two digits available on the credits so stopped at that in case it went to 0.

I showed my friends the credits and we all spent quite a few hours using them up. 

Towards the end one of them asked me to do it again, I told him it won’t work again. Just like earlier I knew it would work, I now knew it wouldn’t, and surprise surprise it didn’t. 

We did try between us a few times after, but it never gave out the free credits again.

It always struck me as strange not so much because it worked and then didn’t, but because I just knew at that one moment it would do it.


tl;dr knew I could get free credits on a pinball machine and did, later knew it wouldn’t do it anymore, and it didn’t.

Today I got home from a four-day Physics camp (Thurs-Sund).

On the first day there, the 6 girls and myself unpacked our things and we all boarded the bus, and the group headed to the beach. I remember specifically going down a small, narrow path to the shore. The teacher wanted us near the cove, which was a distance, so we took the path to save time. It was rocky, and it hurt to walk on, which is why I was so sure of myself.

We reach the beach, spend ~3 hours there, and head back up the path. I walk alongside one of the girls, and she mentions how weird it was we were taking the path instead of the shore.

I asked why it was unusual, as we had taken the path to get there. All 6 girls give me this weird look, and one says ""but we walked along the shore to get to the cove..""

The path is around 20 metres from the shore, so there is no mistake in the difference between the path and shore. The girls had no reason to lie, as it wouldn't benefit them.

All other girls agreed, they swore we walked along the shore to get to the beach, but I only remember a path.

The subject she'd switched onto, I shit you not, was about how much she hated clowns. I was amused at her sudden outpouring of hatred against clowns, because I never knew that she had thought about them at any length, and I turned to her so she could see the strange face I was making to express my amusement. To my surprise, I saw that her mouth wasn't moving, or open at all, but I could still hear her talking.

I looked carefully at her and said, ""I like clowns, they're cool.""

She finally opened her mouth. ""Well, I still think they're cree--"" and then looked shocked, realizing what had happened.

""I wasn't saying any of that out loud! How did you know what I was thinking? I've never talked about clowns before!""

""I don't know! But I could hear you, it was in my head!""

Being two young girls, we were just very happy and excited, and thought it was proof that we were best friends forever, and unsuccessfully spent the rest of the walk home trying to replicate the effect.

We make it a point to go at least twice a year, but had not gone yet. We found a new campsite, for us, that was very remote with no modern facilities like electricity or running water. We set out for our drive up.

As we are driving up we burn down a few joints, as is proper for a camping expedition. As we are driving up I notice that the lighter is running on fumes. You know, its one of the $0.99 cheap lighters that you can see the fluid, or lack thereof. I refuse to stop for a new lighter in order to make good time on our drive, and justify my reasoning by assuring my girlfriend that one we get there we can use the grill lighter that is packed away.

We did just that. The night went off without a hitch, we drank, talked, reminisced about the past camping trips with her father, and at some point drunkenly made our way to the tent for the remainder of the night.

The next morning I wake up and go to start a fire for breakfast. The grill lighter is on the table, but soaked with morning dew (condensation) and wont spark. I decide to go and grab the 'out of fuel' lighter to see if I can use the spark on it to light the grill lighter. I unlock the car, open the door, look in the cupholder, and there is the lighter. I pick it up and I realize that the lighter is full. Completely full. Bewildered, I wake my girlfriend, and tell her I might be having some sort of memory lapse or some other crazy shit, and just simply say, ""Shit, whatever, just look at this."" and I toss her the lighter. She catches it, sees it's full and throws it in the corner of the tent, exclaiming, ""What the fuck!?! Is that the lighter from the car!?!""

We both bring it up from time to time. Joking about that time the matrix glitched out on us. But it happened, and though not a very big difference, it was definitely a noticeable difference, that we both observed.

Back in elementary school when I was in 4th grade, I had recently transferred schools due to a progressive program for gifted children and therefore knew no one. My first week of school was comprised of taking in my environment, and studying the many new faces that were presented to me. After the week was over, I had managed to get a grasp of my surroundings, as well as acquire a mental roster of my fellow classmates. Coming home on Friday, I was naturally exhausted from a over stimulating week, so I got a good night's rest. The dream that occurred that night however, is when things started to feel strange. I don't remember the specifics of the dream, but I definitely remember the message. The following morning I revealed this message to my mom... someone in my class was going to die, and it would be within the year. To my mom, this probably seemed like nothing more than the silly dream of a nine year old, until I finished recounting it to her. Not only did I know that someone was going to die, I knew that it was going to be one of two girls: Elizabeth or Julia. 

As the year progressed and I started to become acclimated to my new school, I began to learn things about my classmates. Among the things I learned was that both Elizabeth and Julia shared something in common with me; we all had chronic asthma. We were the kids that needed to take their inhalers everywhere they went, in the case of a random asthma attack. We were also the kids who would get sick every time pollen began to lace the air in the fall and spring, and be unable to do much of anything but stay inside. As the year progressed, I felt stronger in my conviction that someone was going to die, but now was slightly frightened that it could be me. I felt a connection to these two girls that I did not feel with my other classmates. I can't explain it, but we all felt very similar. 

Moving to spring time, the year is almost over and still nothing had happened. As part of a creative curriculum for my progressive class, my teachers were about to hold a renaissance art festival, something that many of my classmates had been looking forward to for months. A week prior to this highly anticipated event is when the premonition occurred. I don't know if I can even call it a premonition, as it starkly contrasted from anything I have ever experienced. Beginning approximately one week before the start of the event, up until the night before, I dreamt nothing but the color white. Every night, it would be the same. No dreams, no visions, nothing other than the constant blank slate of white. 

The day of the event was full of excitement and energy. The festival was to take place after lunch, and continue for the remainder of the day. At lunch recess, I was playing a game of handball, like I had always done, when I suddenly fell due to stepping on the ball. When I hit the ground, I let out an ""ow"", and although it was strange, it wasn't anything serious, so I got back up and finished my recess. After the break, the festival had finally arrived, and children and teacher alike adorned renaissance costumes and took part in various art activities. About halfway through the festival, there was a sudden stir among the teachers and staff. Something was wrong, and immediately I felt a sense of unease. There were sirens echoing throughout the air, and people running to the office. The festival was interrupted, and the feeling of tension was palpable. The activities had come to an end rather abruptly due to this happening, and teachers began notifying parents to pick up their kids from school early. It wasn't until I was home, and approached by my teary eyed mom that I was told what had happened. Elizabeth had just died... she had just died from an asthma attack. 

The following day at school, my class took the first part of the day reflecting on Elizabeth. Several stories were shared and one of them utterly shocked me. Elizabeth's two best friends were recounting her last day, and mentioned that she was much quieter than usual. During the lunch recess prior to the festival, the recess that I had fallen and cried out in pain, Elizabeth didn't say much. The last words that anyone had heard from Elizabeth, the last words she uttered before she was rushed to the school's medical office due to the severe asthma that took her life were: ""was that LionHeart717?""

There is a boulevard in my town that holds a lot of stuff that makes life awesome. 
To drive on this boulevard, there are designated U-turn spots, and the opposite lanes of traffic do not meet at all - there is land between them for the entire stretch. 


On this boulevard there used to be a medical center, you know, giant building with a ton of medical offices. The building itself is still there, but it has been closed for YEARS and has not been taken care of even though it is for sale and has been since I'm going to guess 2005. It is very close to a Sam's Club, and a sushi restaurant that I was debating going to because yesterday was my birthday. My mother was driving, and as we passed this medical center, it looked GREAT. Fresh paint, the parking lot completely freshly paved, nurses coming in and out of the building.

This would have taken months to accomplish. I looked over at my mom to raise an eyebrow to see if she saw all of this - we had been there just a week prior and it was still abandoned as ever, and when I looked back it was back to the way it was last week - dilapidated and gross.

1360319579.0,80,self.Glitch_in_the_Matrix,184iwm,Impossible hallway that broke my understanding of spacial logic (x-posted from r/thetruthishere),94,14,36,http://www.reddit.com/r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix/comments/184iwm/impossible_hallway_that_broke_my_understanding_of/,"I was going to post this story on r/nosleep, but since it actually happened and isn't scary, this seems like a more appropriate place.

Back when I was a sophmore in highschool (2005-2006), I had a class in the school's second oldest building, which we called, “the old main”. The building was built in the 1930's, I believe, and was legally condemned while I was attending school there. The year this took place happened to be the last year there were any students allowed in the building. So yes, this was an old building at an even older school (opened in the 1910's), and this highschool had legends of ghosts, as any old school does, and a few documented deaths on campus (a plane crash [saw the bodies myself], a girl fell down a long set of stairs, and a homeless man hung himself). But besides the floorboards creaking, the windows not being safe to open, and the constant feeling that it would collapse at any moment, there was nothing particularly odd or creepy about the building.

So... during a normal class period, between noon and 2:00pm, my teacher gave me keys and asked me to get some more copies of the book we were assigned to read from a storage closet at the end of the hallway. When I went in the storage room, I noticed that it was connected to a long, tile-floored, hallway. Not knowing this room was there, and thinking I'd never see it again, I wandered in. I felt uneasy the moment my foot went from the carpet to the tile. The only window was an old skylight, so everything in it was a cold, blue, hue. This hallway was taller than the rest of the rooms on this floor of the building; guessing by the skylight, the attic just didn't extend over this room. The only other things I remember about it is that there were old overhead monitors and other classroom furnishings in it, and that there were drains in the floor. I assumed it was just some weird, old chem lab or something and went back to class with the books. Nothing unusual happened the rest of the class period.

After class, I went down the stairs and outside to lunch, I think, and as I rounded the corner of the building it occurred to me that I should see what this hallway looked like from the outside. It wasn't there. Where it should have been was just air. I could see in the windows of the last classroom on the hallway, and the windows into a hallway in the adjoined building, which if the room I found had been visible, would have been impossible to see. These two buildings shared an interior wall and formed a rough “L” shape. This bizarre hallway would have been in the interior 90 degree angle of the “L”.

I am sure that the windows on the adjoining building (the district office at the time and the original building of the school), went to a different a hallway. The hallway that could be seen from the outside had pictures hanging in it, and I recognized them from when we, in choir, would walk down it to sing at the yearly holiday district staff party. The hallway I had been in earlier had no pictures.

I've explained this room to other classmates, and none of them have known what I'm talking about. I've gone back to this school every once-in-a-while, usually to play capture the flag at night, and I always avoid being close to where this hallway should be; it just creeps me out too much.

Has anyone ever experienced a place like this, or know what kind of architectural tricks are being pulled here? I'm adding a link to screenshots of these buildings from google maps so that you can see what I mean. http://imgur.com/a/f9XEv

A few years ago I was with my wife in Toronto. We were walking down the stairs into the subway and were having a discussion about something (I don't remember what) that had pissed us both off. Conveniently, our train had just pulled into the station as we reached the platform. Everyone started getting on the train, and we were at the end of a line of people entering the last door of the last car of the train. While we waited for the people ahead of us to get on, my wife was reminding me not to let my anger get to me and ruin the rest of our day (I guess I can be a somewhat irascible character at times). The guy in front of us got on the train, and I stepped up to do the same when the doors shut right in my face--which was weird, it's not like the train was at capacity or anything. My wife and I exchanged WTF faces, the train started moving away, and as it did the white and black ""Danger Do Not Enter"" sign on the wall behind it came into view. Except the first ""D"" and the ""Do"" had been worn away somehow, so that we, the only people left on the platform, were left staring at a sign that read:

This is my first post on this subreddit. As a warning, this is a long story, but it is 100% true. So, here it is; I remember this one day, very clearly. Almost too clearly. A long time ago, I was at the local WAL-MART (we have the smallest one in North America!), just shopping with my parents, when I walked away from them for just a moment, and then realized I was lost. I was around 4 years old at the time, and it was a busy day at the store, probably close to Easter, or Christmas. So I started crying, as a lost and afraid 4 year old does, and then this large mysterious man grabs my hand, and walks me out into the strip mall that is attached to the store. He sits me down at a bench and says: ""Are you lost, little boy? Do you need your parents?"" Sobbing, I replied: ""Yea, I do need my parents."" He nods, and walks back into WAL-MART. He disappears into the store, and a few minutes later, my parents appear before me. I eventually forgot about this incident, until about six years later. I was ten, and at Edmonton, Alberta's famed Rexall Place Stadium for my first Monster Jam show. I got up with my dad, because I had to go to the washroom, and the place was huge, and crowded, and he wouldn't allow me to go alone. He said he would wait for me by the entrance of the facility, and he sent me in alone. When I got out, lo and behold, he was gone. I started to cry, because I was really afraid. (Seem familiar?) and so, a few seconds later, I get scooped up by this guy. He sits me down on the floor, in a location where it isn't crowded, and (woah, its the same guy as before, and he hasn't gotten any older! He looks exactly the same!) he says to me ""Hey, are you looking for yer dad?"" I nod in fear and confusion. He leaves again, with another reassuring look in his eyes, and he disappears around the corner. About five minutes later, my dad appears from around the same corner. The show goes on, and I never tell anybody about this man. 2011. I'm older now. Old enough for my second rock concert. Rexall Place once again. 2nd Annual Rockstar Energy Drink UPROAR Tour (I've gone two years in a row) and I am stoked on life. This is going to be the best concert ever. and it is. Not a problem. No parents with me, only a good older friend who drove me into Edmonton. So in between acts Bullet for My Valentine and Seether, I get up to go to the washroom. Everything is good, but I'm having crazy flashbacks of those two previous incidents. These flashbacks are so intense, that I go sit down in that same corner (without realizing it was the same corner) because I felt like vomiting. I just step out of the washroom to go sit down, and I swear. That man walks past. I can't physically prove that this happened, but I promise that he looked at me, and just kept walking. So, what is this, Reddit? I'm not asking for tons of responses, just food for thought. These series of incidents have kept me awake for many nights. I quite often wonder who this man is, and if it isn't just my mind playing games. But I know he is real. I've felt him. He's picked me up, as I've said! But he appears, as if he turns on and off when needed. Like a guardian angel. and I'm not religious, folks.

To explain, I never see anything major/life altering/world changing, or anything that would make a huge difference to life in general. It happens just like a regular dream. I'll fall asleep, dream something as normal, wake up either already forgetting about it, or passing it off as a normal dream and forgetting about it almost immediately.

Then, days/weeks/moths later (it's yet to be longer than a few months), the event that I've dreamed about happens. As soon as it begins, I have a MASSIVE sense of deja vu and remember that I've dreamed this. I'm able to tell what will be said next or what is about to happen. Not very far in the future mind you.

For example, last year, in high school, I had a dream where I was in a room that I had never been in before, on a couch, talking with two guys who I hardly knew at that point in time, and I was being really friendly with them as if we were pals. This is my first term in university now. The room was the student lounge where I always hang out now, and the people are good friends now. I didn't remember the dream as soon as I walked into the lounge on day one, or as soon as I saw them at the school, but when the exact scenario in the dream started to happen, I recognized and realized that if I had known better, I could have predicted where I would be for university and who I be friends with.

Other info, the dreams are all from first person perspective, and I remember when I SEE what I saw in the dream (ie, seeing a tree from a certain angle with the right lighting. Seeing the tree any other way won't set it off.) I've attempted lucid dreaming VERY passively, and should probably try again, but the problem there is that I'd be altering the dream so that I won't be able to accurately see what will happen. It would help with remembering though.

I hope that wall of text wasn't too much, and I REALLY hope this isn't buried. I'll respond to any questions you have (or I'll try). If you experience this too, please post.

(Won't post anymore, but you get the picture).

Obviously a ""Glitch in the Matrix"" is a great catch-all term, but the accounts above really start to bring in to question the idea of parallel universes temporarily interacting with one another.  As one commentator said, it explains many things - such as random things going missing (or indeed, being added) from/to your household.  

The only glitch I can think of, came at my old house last year.  I found a book under my laptop, it was a book on survival in the wilderness, published in 1977 - the year of my birth.  I never purchased the book - it was not in the inventory of the house when I moved in.  I've also moved since then and no longer have it in my possession.  I remember calling my parents, friends, asking if it was theirs', in case they had inadvertantly left it there.  No successes.  The idea of a temporary parallel universe colliding with our own, would make it explainable.  Perhaps in another universe I *did* buy it.  Or a friend *did* bring it (for whatever reason you need to buy a book from 1977).

Thinking more, this led me to some other theories.  Psychics.  Assuming we can throw away the obvious fakes (maybe not an easy thing to do), who have a perception in other universes?  Sometimes they are right, and sometimes they are disastrously wrong (in the case of that recent case of the 3 kidnapped girls, painfully so)...  but what if in the universe the psychic saw, that *was* the outcome?  Not being aware of parallel universes it would just look like an error in ours, no?

Are ghosts that some people apparently see - brief windows in to other universes, where the collision isn't strong enough to cause the sort of interactions present in the other glitches?  Did the ""ghost"" in the other universe see the observer in our universe as a ghost?

What gets more interesting, is if there are parallel universes how are they generally segregated?  What causes a temporary collision?  Depending on the nature of these things it might happen more often than we expect, or perhaps even continually - but usually never to any huge degree of causality.  My son is watching Nickolodean right now.  How often are we colliding with universes, but everything is as it ""should be"" (and I use that term loosely).

**EDIT**

Another thought...  what if parallel universes were not *quite* at the same global time-line?  This might also explain premonitions, or seeing future events unfold.  Again, depending on the collision it might well turn out to be false, but it *did* happen in the universe the observer saw.

There was a scene where these kids were all in the bathroom fighting, and then all of them froze while the main character went through an internal dialogue.  However, because of the way the lights were positioned, on the back wall, the actors' shadows appeared to be hanged.  The ""rope"" was actually shadows from beams.  I found it pretty creepy and it stuck with me so I decided to keep the program.

Anyway, about two years later, I found out one of the actors had slipped on some ice while drunk and died.  I didn't think much of it until today when I heard that another of the actors (whose shadow was being hanged) was shot.

I know it's just a coincidence, but I find it very strange that 2 out of the 4 actors in that scene have died in the past 10 years.  I was thinking about maybe mentioning what I saw to the remaining two (they're on my Facebook), but I'm afraid they would think I'm nuts.  I don't know.

To quote some of the rules:

&gt;**Blacking out** is not a glitch, unless it happened to a group of people and everyone was sober.

This seems to be one of the most common types of stories posted at the moment. However, it is well known scientific knowledge that cortisol is produced in moments of stress, and is very strongly linked to short term memory loss. Stop quoting quantum suicide, you don't understand it.

&gt; **Driving alone** and feeling the car ""teleport"" forward a few yards may not be a glitch, it is all too easy to be tired, or not paying attention during a drive. A carload of Ivy-Leaguers going to college twice is interesting, however. Courtesy of anteater1138

I've also seen this referred to recently. Here there are even more factors that are potentially involved; tiredness, stress and brain auto-pilot. How many times have you been driving (or doing any other mundane, well known task), only to realise that you haven't been concentrating and can't honestly recall anything from the last 5 minutes? If you want more information, Google how the brain goes into auto-pilot in relation to the striatum. Come on guys, this isn't some crazy, unexplained phenomenon.

&gt; Quantum mechanics and quantum suicide really don't work in the way the layman would think, and furthermore, even if one's consciousness ""hopped"" universes, one wouldn't be aware because memories are stored physically in the brain and wouldn't ""hop"" with it. Don't bring QM up unless you know what you are talking about. Courtesy of anteater1138

This one is starting to irritate me slightly. There are a couple of people here that are posting on all of these 'black out' style posts, claiming quantum suicide. So here we go...quantum physics relate to the micro (particle) scale and not the macro (visible to the naked eye) scale. The confusion seems to lie with some basic explanations about it that use human death as an example to illustrate the point. This is not how you should learn about quantum suicide. Tegmark himself (you don't even know who he is, do you?) even refers to decoherence (where quantum physics break down when being applied to classical physics) as a justifiable reason for why quantum suicide is unlikely to be applicable on the macro scale. Just do some reading...please!! Until a unified theory for quantum physics and classical physics arises, this shouldn't even be a topic of conversation. If you're trying to be scientific, then you should know this. Stop trying to quote science if you don't understand it, it doesn't make your opinions valid, it actually makes them less so.

&gt; When you were a kid... **stop**. Due to the way human memory works, one can easily confuse dreams or fantasies with reality.(Courtesy of anteater1138) Think before you post, there have been excellent stories, but most of them are obviously childhood confusion.

I've also seen this type of thing lately. Memories are well known to be fallible, even recent ones. I shouldn't have to tell you what to look up to find a ton of research done on this.

When I was a lot younger than that, I was kinda known for telling my parents ""-insert bad thing- is gonna happen"" and it would, so my dad started to take me pretty seriously when I'd say things like that.

I'd gone a long time without making any kind of ""predictions"" or anything of the sort and my dad and I were out at dinner one night. I told him I was scared to drive back because I felt like I was going to get in a wreck. He kind of rolled his eyes, but noticed how upset I was getting, so he drove us home, incident free. Same thing happened when we were at lunch the next day- I refused to drive us because I felt like we were going to wreck, then we made it home safe and sound.

After two days of this feeling not leaving, my dad stopped being my driver everywhere (I had my own car anyway) and I drove out to a friend's house. She and I watched some movies, then decided we wanted dessert, so we were gonna go to Red Lobster, less than a mile from her house. A third friend was with us and he decided he'd follow us in his car, then just go home after dessert. Yet again, I started feeling super uneasy and told my friend we should just stay in, but ended up caving to peer pressure.

We'd been on the road less than a minute, were literally only 200 feet from her house, and a drunk driver runs a light and t-bones us. It wasn't too severe of a wreck- both cars got totalled and my foot ended up shattered, but no other injuries for anyone, thankfully. My car ended up in a ditch in front of a gas station and before anyone had made it from the gas station to my car, my dad was calling me. I answered and started telling him what had happened when he cut me off and said ""I thought that was you, I heard everything and just had this feeling, I'm at a friend's house around the corner, I'll be right there.""

I'm not sure if I really made a prediction or if I created some kind of self-fulfilling or something, but being able to call that I was going to be in a wreck, then my dad knowing it was me and being in the area at the time (it was 15 or 20 miles away from our house) is what kinda weirds me out about everything.",,False,,t5_2tcwa,False,,,True,t3_uhtex,http://www.reddit.com/r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix/comments/uhtex/predicted_a_car_wreck/,

I was looking through all my old books, and one in particular, a child's encyclopaedia, reminded me of this glitch that occurred 5 years ago...

When I was 10, my parents went to the New Forest for a weekend to celebrate their anniversary. While they were there, my mum lost her wedding ring somehow, and she spent hours with my stepdad searching round the cabin with they were staying in, looking for it. They retraced their steps back down every path they could remember walking on, and even called at the local police station to see if it had been handed in. They could not find it anywhere, and my mum was devastated. It was a very distinctive ring, made of titanium, in a very plain design, kinda square with a tiny diamond and an inscription on the inside.

Two years later, my room was being redecorated. I wanted to get rid of my bookshelf, as I was no longer interested in most of the books I owned, and I started to sort through them. I made a pile of boxes in order to reach the top shelf, which contained books I hadn't read in years. Up there was an encyclopaedia, which used to be my favourite book. I wanted to have a look through it again before it got moved to the loft, so I started to pull it off the shelf. This was difficult, as the books were packed together very tightly, and I nearly fell off the stack of boxes when it suddenly slipped out from between the neighbouring books. As I steadied myself, I saw something small fall out of the book pages, and heard it hit my carpet. I jumped off the boxes to see what it was, and to my disbelief, it was my mum's wedding ring. The one that she lost 200 miles away, two years before. I rushed downstairs to give it to her, and she cried tears of joy. Neither of us could come up with an explanation as to how it ended up there, but since then, she's been extra careful not to lose it again.",,False,,t5_2tcwa,False,,,True,t3_ph9wo,http://www.reddit.com/r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix/comments/ph9wo/mums_wedding_ring/,

I had these dreams that started when I was about three or four years old (1973/74).  I was hiding in a hole in the wall in the back of a closet.  My family had hidden me there (not anyone in my real family) to protect me from some soldiers who from some obviously opposing force.  I was scared, but I was told to stay very quiet.  A few minutes later I heard my father yelling angrily, then some gun fire and screaming.  I heard men coming up to the second floor where the closet was and getting very close to where I was hidden, but they didn't find me.

I don't know how long I was there because it was dark.  I was getting very hungry and thirsty and wanted to get out but my family had instructed me to stay in the hole until someone came for me.  They assured me that someone would.  It is honestly very difficult to tell how long I was there, but eventually someone did come and open the hole.  A young black haired woman with fair skin and very piercing eyes.  She was probably about 16 or 17.

She pulled me out put a coat on me and took me out of the house.  It was late evening and it was pretty chilly outside.  Maybe 50-60 F.  She strapped me to a seat on her motorcycle and took off.  I remember seeing a big wall that ran along the countryside.  It had all kinds of symbols on it that lit up a bright blue.  Like blue LEDs.  There were lots of trees in the distance behind the wall and less on this side of the wall.  Then I fell asleep.  Whenever I fell asleep, I would wake up in real life.

This woman was with me in my dreams from about age three/four to about 18/19.  I aged in the dream as well, and eventually she and I became romantically involved.  We spent a lot of time hiding from whoever these soldiers were, and other times we planted bombs to attack the other side.  She seemed to be a resistance fighter of some kind and raised me to be the same way.

It wasn't until I was in my mid 20s when I dreamt that world one more time.  This time what was really odd was that I was in a house that was a blend of my real life home and this other world from my dreams.  The furniture in my room was different and there was a military uniform hanging up in the room as if I was going to put it on.  There were some photos on a dresser of a man (me?) and a woman that looked like they were taken in the early 20th century.  Black and white...  I looked out the window and there was an amusement park within about a half mile of my house (there isn't one in real life).  I turned around and saw her one more time.  She looked older and seemed shocked to see me.  Then I passed out and... woke up.

The thing that strikes me about these dreams is the consistency.  Each time I had them (and I had a lot of them) it was like picking up with your day after you wake up from a nap.  The aging that took place in the dreams seemed to match the aging in my real life.  Yeah, I supposed there's not really all that much that's glitchy about this, but somehow I feel like it fits here.

It was a really good frisbee and I didn't wanna leave it, so I bested the nettles in combat and made my way into the bushes. I find the frisbee without too much trouble and as I pick it up I see another white frisbee a bit further in.

I've done my nails with this polish for months, along with my sisters and mothers nails, too. My mom and sister can.both confirm that it was a glittery nail polish, and we were all going to do our nails with it again because it was our favorite. 

I went into my nail-polish drawer, and picked it up. it wasn't glittery. Okay...maybe it all settled to the bottom somehow? But there's so much glitter in it, it would be very noticeable at the bottom. Anybody who's messed with even a little bit of glitter knows that it gets EVERYWHERE. So, I shook the bottle. Nothing happened..I added nail Polish remover to the bottle and shook it more. I shook for like 45 seconds and nothing happened. I just said forget it, and apply it. I could be hallucinating for all I know. I applied it to my nails, to my sisters, and my mom's. 
Still no glitter. Not even a little. Just a plain red. Not one chunk of glitter. 
My sister and mother and father don't see any glitter either. So I know I'm not crazy. On the outside, near the brush, there's a very little bit of glittery crust. But definitely not enough for all the glitter to have migrated there. 

I know it's not that interesting..its not scary, paranormal, or skipped time, and not even about death, but I still thinks it's pretty strange... I mean a ghost couldn't have taken away the glitter. It would be messy.

When I was 13, I was shopping in an Abercrombie and Fitch by myself (my mom was in another store). I was waiting in line to try something on and saw some pictures hanging on the wall. They weren't like the normal Abercrombie and Fitch pictures of hot naked people; these were pictures of a group of people at what seemed to be a birthday party, and they weren't big posters, but regular 4x6s in plain black frames. Also unlike normal A&amp;F pictures, these people seemed to be in their thirties or forties, not late teens. 

I didn't think much of it till I realized that I was in the picture. It wasn't my 13 year old self, but it was me as an adult. I knew because it was my smile- I have a really big goofy smile that comes out when I'm really happy. I was sitting next to a guy with glasses who was looking at me and not the camera. The other people around me were happy and everything looked great. It freaked me out a little but I was mostly comforted- I knew immediately that this was me in the future, and that I was happy. 

I wasn't with anyone so I couldn't point it out, and the next time I was in the store, all of the pictures were gone. 

Funny thing is, I've been dating a guy who wears glasses for the past five years. He hates taking pictures so sometimes he'll look at me instead of the camera. I can't remember anyone else in the picture, but I'm pretty sure he was the one sitting next to me and looking at me. 

Like I said, this is mostly comforting.

I'm in Canada, not the US, but we get a lot of US channels. I had only a small interest in a former US president - I barely knew who he was. I was just trying to enjoy a Saturday watching TV.

But every single channel I turned to had Reagan on it. I didn't have a lot of channels, maybe 20 or so, but they were all showing Reagan. As I switched through I got a sequence of audio clips all mentioning his name: ""Ronald Reagan, the 40th..."" (change) ""Ronald Reagan, who passed away..."" (change) ""Today, Ronald Reagan..."" (change) ""Ronald Reagan? The actor?!!"" (change)

Wait a minute? That last line was not even a news broadcast. It was a scene from Back to the Future which was playing on TV that day:


    Doc: Tell me, Future Boy, who's President of the United States in 1985?
    Marty: Ronald Reagan.
    Doc: Ronald Reagan? The actor? [rolls his eyes] Ha! Then who's vice-president, Jerry Lewis? I suppose Jane Wyman is the First Lady?
    Marty: Whoa, wait. Doc!

I started to drive home, and the plan was I'd get home, mow the lawn (I'd promised to get that done for my housemates but I'd skived off during the week), clean up and drive the three hours to Sydney to my parents' place to get there somewhere after dinner friday night. It should have gone like this:

3pm - leave work
3:50pm - arrive home and start mowing
4:30pm - shower, clean up, dry off and...
5pm - leave for mum's in Sydney
8:30pm - arrive at mum's.

What happened instead was I drove home, and rushed through to start mowing the lawn like I'd promised my flatmates. I got back inside, stripped off, got in the shower - and woke up being revived in my *parents* shower three hours away. Apparently I'd arrived at my mum's house before she'd come home, mowed the lawn THERE, got in the shower and passed out from a touch of heat exhaustion. My mum came home and found my car in the driveway, the grass mown, and me in the shower a bit too long before she checked I was OK.

Thing is, she woke me in the shower at her house a little after 6pm friday. Even if I'd driven breaking every speed limit for the 250km from work directly to her house, I couldn't have reached there much before 6:30pm (the distance isn't quite three and a half hours worth, but it's a tight winding city/mountain drive with city speed limits for a good third of it), let alone drive, arrive, mow the lawn there (it's almost an hour's job), and shower.

Next morning I checked with my flatmates and the lawn there had indeed been mown by the time one of them had arrived home after finishing work at 5, and my grass-covered work clothes were in the corner of the bathroom. I remember mowing the lawn there. I remember stripping off to get in the shower, but I don't remember showering or mowing the Sydney lawn. I'd left my work clothes with grass clippings in the bathroom at my place, but in mum's shower was a fresh change I don't remember getting into covered in grass clippings.

It seems if reality is to be violated, what seemed to happen was this:

3pm - leave work
4pm - arrive at my place and mum's place at the same time. Start mowing in both locations
4:30-5pm - strip off, start showering in both locations.
5:30pm - disappear from home, re-integrate at mum's in the shower and pass out.

I just found this sub and I think it fits here.

When I was about 9, my brother and I were flying paper airplanes around the living room. We never opened the windows in the summer because we had central air, and lived in the desert, so all the windows and doors in the house were closed. Our windows were single pane, but there were two of them, so basically you had the interior window with a spring-loaded latch, then an open space between it and the exterior window of about 3 inches. I guess it was like, a precursor to double paned windows or something.

So I threw my paper airplane and it curved sharply to the right, went around the wall into the dining room (a few feet away), and when I ran after it, I couldn't find it anywhere. The rooms in that house were really small--it was a 14 foot wide mobile home, so there really couldn't have been any place it could have gone that I wouldn't have seen it. I crawled out from under a table and looked up at the window and flipped out, because it was actually in between the two closed windows, nose down. I had to call my mom and brother in to look at it to make sure I wasn't hallucinating or something, and I remember slapping my hand on the glass. I had to actually work the spring-loaded latch and open the window to get it back out.

I simply can't think of a plausible explanation for it.

As a hotel desk agent, I sometimes have to set up the breakfast buffet in our club lounge. Flush against the wall on one side of the lounge is a long counter top, about two and a half feet wide, with cabinets underneath. Just above this are a set of three shelves, each a couple inches wide. It's important to note that the shelves don't stick out as far from the wall as the counter top below them does. On one of these shelves we place two metal bowls full of fruit. Usually we replace the fruit every other morning, so the bowls just stay there overnight. When I came into the lounge that particular morning, the fruit looked fine, so I didn't touch or move the bowls at all. 

Before I even went near the buffet, I took out a rag to wipe down some of the tables in the room. The kitchen had forgotten to prepare a smoked fish platter, so I stared at the counter and shelves as I cleaned to try and figure out a way to arrange what I had so it didn't look empty. I was all the way across the room from the buffet, about 10-15 feet removed, when something bizarre happened. All of a sudden, one of the bowls of fruit was not on the shelf anymore. It was *poised* in midair at least three feet horizontally from the shelf's edge yet at exactly the same height from the ground. I didn't see it move or slide to that position. It just appeared there, as though I were watching a film clip with a few frames missing. It didn't float, exactly, but it seemed to linger for just a fraction of an instant too long before it crashed to the ground. The fruit shot everywhere. An orange rolled into the corner of the room. I was absolutely frozen with the *wrongness* of what I'd just seen.

My first thought was that the shelf had collapsed. Yet the second bowl of fruit was still resting atop it, placid as ever. When I collected myself enough to walk across the room and investigate, I could find nothing amiss with the shelf. Also weird was the fact that the bowl hadn't hit the (rather wide) counter on its way down, but rather fell straight to the floor a few inches in front of the cabinet doors. If the fruit bowl had merely tipped off the shelf, it would have hit the counter top. Whatever had moved the bowl had to have enough force to throw it several feet away from the shelf before it fell. No one but me was in the lounge, nor could anyone have entered without my noticing. And even though it was early in the morning, I know I didn't entirely dream the incident because the phone rang a few minutes later with my manager saying we'd received a noise complaint from an adjacent room. 

I started cleaning up the mess of smashed banana and runaway oranges, all the time thinking, ""so either I'm crazy, or there's a run in the fabric of space-time.""",,False,,t5_2tcwa,False,,,True,t3_pcfkn,http://www.reddit.com/r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix/comments/pcfkn/quantum_fruit_bowl/,

He was my dream friend and we had some pretty good, yet mundane times.  We had a really strong connection, almost like brothers, and the dreams were typically very vivid, hard to distinguish from reality.  Beyond high school and into college (mind you, roughly 6 years after the mall incident), he started to change.  First losing his hair and slowly becoming more of a malevolent presence.  When I was about 23, the transition was complete - he was the figure from the mall I'd ""inhabited"" almost 10 years earlier.

Truly a chicken or the egg situation.  Was I seeing the future of my own dreams or was the future coming back to pay me a visit?

 The first thing was that I was in my living room just playing a videogame. The kitchen is pretty close by, so if there was anyone there I would have heard them.

The next evening, my mother was cooking dinner and bumped into my grandmother (who is clumsy), and she dropped the plate in her hands. Exact same sounds, except for a yelp that came from my grandmother who is jumpy and nervous.

 The second thing is similar, but on a larger scale. It was a calm Friday with ugly looking clouds. It looked like it would eventually rain. By around noon, I started to hear the soft taps of rain against the windows and decided to look out to see how bad it was. When I look, no rain, and the sidewalks are totally dry. At that moment (when I looked out), the sound of falling rain stopped. The whole day went by without a drop from the sky. Saturday morning came. I get up early to go to school, and walk out the house to rain. Being half-asleep at 6am, I wasn't aware of the sounds of falling rain until I actually came outside.

Right.

My friend lent me his copy of *The Prestige*. I know, fantastic movie, but I digress. I watched it with my old man the Friday he lent it to me, cased it, and left it on top of my desk to give it back to him that Sunday.

My Dad left for business the next morning and no one else was lives in the house (it's just me and him). I didn't have any friends over and I didn't watch it again, e.g., no one touched/moved the movie from the spot in which I placed it.

When I brought the movie over to my friend's place, he opened up the case and didn't find anything inside. He asked me if I was messing with him. I wasn't. I brought the case back home and I scoured the Earth for it. Our house is immaculate, we're 2 perfectionist, 1 germaphobe, living under 1 roof, no fuckin' way something like this happens. 

I called my Dad to see if he had touched it or watched it again. He, emphatically, said no. I told him it was impossible for the damn thing to just get up and walk out on it's own to which he replied he didn't care for the movie and didn't want to watch it again so why would he move it? Not sure if I'm more surprised by it going missing or by him not liking the movie.

3 years go by. My buddy hassles me for it every now and then but it's mostly a rib. He isn't mad that I lost it and never pressured me to replace it. About 2 months ago I was sitting down to watch another movie with dear old Dad. I pop open the DVD player and the goddamn movie is inside. I turn to my Father and ask where the hell this movie came from. He had no clue, didn't even recognize the movie. I had to explain to him that this was the movie my friend lent me about the magicians. He had no clue.

So there it was. Sitting in the DVD player after 3 years with no explanation. The same goddamn DVD player we watched a hundred movies on since that night.

We headed to the skate park in the centre of my city, about a 5minute skate from the bottom of the hill.
 
My friend started skating on the street section of the park, and I hit the bowl. I had just finished a run and was standing on the edge of the bowl watching my friend going for a line

As I watched he came down the ramp on the far side of the park and went over the pyramid (for those who don't know it's like a flat topped area raised up with curving angled sides down to the ground) he did an ollie and wen't for a casual 180, which he normally pulls off with ease. Tonight though he landed with his weight too far forward, and bailed. Problem was his bail line had him heading directly for a solid concrete 1.5m high, 0.5m wide wall that that had a rail on top of it (the ramps up to the higher ground were on either side of the wall).

I watched as he headed towards it, thinking ""Oh fuck, this is going to be bad"", when suddenly right before my eyes he kind of blinked/skipped sideways, and continued forward with his original momentum and slide along the ground and up part of the incline to the higher ground completely missing hitting the concrete wall. I couldn't believe it... I was so sure he was going to eat shit on the wall. I ran over and he was hyperventilating and shaking on the ground. He was a little scratched from concrete but otherwise ok. We just looked at each other, a look of complete awe. He got up and was shaking still, really hard. Way more than a small slam like that would normally rattle him. 

We sat down at the edge of the park and I rolled him a cig as he couldn't stop shaking enough to do so. He then looked at me and was like ""Woa dude, did you se... "" and I was like... ""How did that..."" we grabbed our stuff and left pretty soon after that. 
So that's my glitch. Pretty lucky if you ask me. ",,False,,t5_2tcwa,False,,,True,t3_y78dl,http://www.reddit.com/r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix/comments/y78dl/my_friend_teleported/,

I knew he was wrong and I was gonna prove it to him. We got in dumb arguments like this infrequently but when we did, he was always ADAMANT that he was right.

I looked up ""opaque"" in the nearest dictionary. Sure enough, it was listed as a synonym for ""translucent"". I thought I was going crazy. I looked it up online (no dictionary.com back then so it was sketchy) and same thing.

Over the next couple of weeks I talked to this friend or that friend or a coworker about it and they all confirmed that I was dumb and that opaque was indeed a synonym for translucent. Eventually I forgot all about it.

I don't have any idea when the definition of opaque went back to normal, but eventually it did.

I'm half convinced that I slipped into a parallel universe at some point. Like Einstein's many world's theory (I think it's Einstein?), every decision spawns a new universe? I wonder whether our consciousness, or whatever, just navigates all these universes and we're actually just moving from one freeze-frame to the next, really rapidly so it seems like life.

And please excuse my bad language. English is not my first language.

My parents have a house in Washington but decided to move to California around June 2010 and left me and my brother to watch their house. In June 2011, my mom came back to bring my brother with her as well, leaving me all alone in their big house. Some time around September or November 2011 (can't remember exactly, but it was during my Fall quarter in college) I was sleeping in my bedroom on the second floor when I was suddenly woken up by loud knocks on my bedroom door. I woke up and kind of freaked out because I was all alone in the big house. I checked my phone and it was 1:30 AM. I got up and went to open the window. I can remember I was so freaked out that I forgot the window was locked. The thought of being locked in my own bedroom made me even madder and sweat even more. I tried to calm down and realized the darn lock and was able to open the window. I took a few deep breaths in the fresh air then walked to the bedroom door and opened it. There was no one. I then thought it could have been my imagination. I am a pretty practical guy so it would take a whole lot more to convince me that something supernatural had happened, otherwise, it would be more logical to think that my brain was simply experiencing some hallucination from dreaming. Then I went back to sleep.

And it happened again. This time I heard 3 loud knocks which I can still remember clearly today. I looked at my phone. It was 2:00 AM. This time I knew something must definitely have gone wrong here. I am living alone and I remember having locked my doors tight before going to sleep, so there is no possible way somebody other than myself could be present in the house. I could recall vividly what happened next: I was extremely conscious lying on my bed asking back loudly this time with a super calm mind: ""who is that? how can I sleep when you do thing like this?"" Then I got up and opened the door to see no one outside.

I decided to walk down stairs to check the doors. They were all locked. I didn't want to sleep any more so I opened Yahoo Messenger to talk to my buddy who lives in a different country. I told him the event and we talked till 3:30 AM when I felt sleepy and decided to go back to sleep.

That's my story. Still confuses me whenever I think about it.

**TL;DR: living alone in a big house, was sleeping in my bedroom and somebody or something knocking on the door.**

Edit: just to make it clear: I don't believe in ghosts. Even after such event, I still don't. Or should I say in this way: I major in natural science so I don't simply believe something or anything without a proper explanation.

I have been coming up with several theories for that. The simplest one that I discussed with my buddy right after the event was the abnormal change in temperature. It is usually cold inside my house as I keep the inside temp around 60-65 during night time. This could have resulted in the strange sounds. This theory doesn't sound very strong to me though because the sounds were very clear and distinguishable as knocking. A much wilder theory is that there was some sort of distortion in space, a shift in the flux of time-space, causing something or someone to reach out and knock on my door.

First one happened senior year: I was on the freeway one morning, heading to school. I saw a motorcycle splitting lanes and immediately thought of my dad, who rode his motorcycle everyday, and has done so safely for more years than I've been alive.

I started thinking about him getting in a horrible accident. My heart rate went up and I was really, really anxious. I never think about accidents like this, this was a really unusual thought. And it hit me *hard*.

I got home from school that same day, and my mom comes running out telling me my dad in in a hospital a few hours away, he was in a really bad motorcycle accident. He ended up being immobile for a few months, having broken an arm and a leg, as well as some ribs.


*Second story:

Last year, in the college dorms. I had top bunk, and late one night I began to imagine what I would do if an earthquake were to start. I've lived in California my whole life, so it's not like earthquakes were a new thing that I suddenly started to worry about when I went off to college. But for some reason, this night I could NOT fall asleep. For hours I was awake, anxiously going over what I would do in case of an earthquake. 

And what happens as I'm laying awake in bed? An earthquake.

So yeah, I hurried down my little ladder, and started screaming at my roommate Sarah to wake up and told her my story.

Anyways, I'm pretty much a psychic. Edit: Or, like my title hypothesizes, a ""me"" in an alternate universe is psychic. Or the matrix is leaking information to me a few hours too early.

Several of them said that they had approached this guy to say hi and only at the last minute to realize (as they put it) that for some strange reason it just wasn't me.
So they talk about this guy for several months, and I'd never seen him.  This is kind of weird seeing as my mom had been bringing us to the same church my whole life and I was in Sunday school and at least knew by appearance most of the other regular teenagers at church/Sunday school.  One other thing one of my friends had mentioned in passing was that they usually saw this guy with a middle-aged lady who they assumed was his mom, but sometimes a younger woman too who they assumed was his sister.  This was a bit interesting because my mom was the one who brought us to church (my Dad was never religious but my mom insisted that us kids had to go to church), and my sister had just started college but was home sometimes on the weekend.

One Sunday we go to church, and as we're sitting down, I notice this guy a couple pews up with hair that's a lot like mine.  I then notice that he's wearing a shirt that's either the same or very similar to mine - nothing to weird about that, I had gotten it recently at the local Target.  So I think to myself, maybe this is the guy who looks like me and I proceed to stare at the back of his head until he turns around.  Well, sure enough, at one point when you had to either stand up or sit down, he turns around and we lock eyes for a solid ten seconds. He looks just like me.  Maybe he was staring because his friends had mentioned me to him? I have no idea.

Less then a minute later, we had to change positions again and this dude just drops.  He straight up faints.  It was weird because it was a pretty comfortable temperature both in the church and outside.  Anyway, his mom and one of the ushers just sorta grab him out of there and mass continues.  As they're carrying him out, he opens his eyes and just stares at me, with this empty look on his face.

I never saw him again. I finally convinced my mom to let me stop going to church not long after that (for completely unrelated reasons).  I asked around my friends who saw him on the regular and none of them did either.  The church put out a photo album every couple years that families could send a picture in for, and I scoured the most recent ones but couldn't find him.  It was the strangest thing - I guess it's possible that I saw my double and he saw me and as a result one of us had to disappear.

People come here to talk about glitches in reality - something I can understand a need for because I myself have witnessed several.

But what I don't get is the comment section - seems everyone who responds to these people are highly skeptical. No one seems to believe that these people have actually found glitches in reality when it's clear that they have. They're simply told that they're mistaken, that they couldn't have seen what they know they saw, that they were just tripping, and the like.

So essentially, these people come here to be told that the glitch they know full well they witnessed didn't happen.

I've had synchronized dreams with many of my friends and mildly prophetic dreams.



Last year, I started having a series of prophetic dreams hyper condensed into a few weeks. Had a dream a friend went to jail and his girlfriend was freaking out, asking me what to do. Got the exact same call a few days later. Had another dream that an old girlfriend was seeing a tall guy with a very distinct nose, later she starts seeing the exact same guy. Three or four others that I'll omit for brevity / privacy.



Then my roommate tells me about a dream that I was setting a yard on fire, and it was very strange because I was, in her words, ""Very in character"". The very next day, some wayward sparks from a grill catches our deck, yard, and house on fire. 



This is where it starts to get weird - the next day we go to the house to clean up what we can. As we're going through debris, I find an old dream journal. I start flipping through it, and I come across an entry from exactly one year prior.



In it, I'm running from a burning house that looks very much like the one that caught on fire. There was more to the dream, but it was very peculiar, because at the end of the dream I got into an airplane and went back to the beginning of the dream. I experienced the whole dream at once as a continuous loop. I wrote at the end, ""It was like time traveling.""



I start bawling in front of my very confused mother (who had come to help us clean up). She asked what was wrong, and all I can get out is ""I don't wanna dream anymore."" She tells me that I should put the journal down if it's upsetting me.



And maybe I'm just being paranoid, but I've been having many more dreams that have come true this last month. Instances of synchronicity. Last year it seemed like there was a build-up to the fire, and I'm worried it's happening again.

I see a car a bit ahead of me in the slow lane, but a clear center so I begin to merge. 

As I'm merging I look left and see the front end of a silver truck (like a newer F150) inches from me car, as if someone from the slow lane merging in at the same time.

I speed up a little and fully pass the silver truck When I looked in my rear view mirror to make sure I had fully passed it, it was gone. There was no trace of the truck. There's not any exits for about five-seven miles so it couldn't have left, and it didn't pull over to a shoulder. The only cars behind me were a green van and a copper Subaru.

I work in a bakery at a department store. We maintain the most alarming, pants-loading fire drill of a phone in the back of the prep area. It has an unadjustable, loud, shrill ringing designed to be heard in the walk-in freezer, even with the oven running next to it. Well, it does the job and beyond. You can hear it easily all across the store, and it never fails  to make me jump if I'm standing next to it when it goes off.

Plus, it annoys the hell out of people in the deli next door.

So during my shift today, after everyone else in my department went home, I realize nature is calling. I head towards the restroom, but I don't get halfway before the damn phone shrieks, and I go running back to it. Insert boring bakery business here.

From there, it's a steady stream of customers for fifteen minutes. Now I really have to go, and the department is clear for the moment. To be safe, I pull the phone cord out of the wall until I return. 

I make it to the restroom hassle-free this time,  but on the way back, I hear it: the piercing wail of the bakery phone.

At first, I worry a manager came by and saw it right after I left and reconnected it, and I could be facing trouble when I come back. Then I turn the corner, and I see from a distance the empty phone jack on the wall.

Sure enough, I arrive, and the phone is still ringing, still screaming, still unplugged. By now I'm coping by putting myself on autopilot. As I reach for the receiver, I tell myself it probably had just enough power left in it from before I disconnected it, and now it was malfunctioning. After all, a lot of our equipment is frankly garbage. I pick it up.

It keeps ringing. I pick up the phone cord, verify it's the only cable on the phone except the one that links the receiver to the base. I plug it back into the wall. And it connects.

I had a call. The phone was disconnected, but it was ringing, because there was a lady calling to order a cake with hockey players on it.

I work on a big massive octopus of a system at work that handles our payroll, our inventory, our accounts payable, purchasing... it's big.

One of the biggest issues we've faced with this system is that certain tables lack auditing. That is, new records receive a timestamp, but changes do not. The record will indicate how many times it has been changed via a ""change stamp"" field, but not by who or at what time. Annoying, and a lapse in security, right?

So anyway, this has been the case for the 7+ years that I've worked here. For particular tables, there's just no auditing. It's a constant nuisance when users complain about some problem and we can't prove that it's because of a change they made in the middle of a batch cycle, and so on.

So today, I was copied on a highly charged, highly political email about just such an issue. A user complained that a record was entered well before a batch processing cycle, but wasn't picked up. I've dealt with this complaint many times. Sometimes I'm able to audit the record indirectly and prove user error, and sometimes I find an actual system problem. Most often, I can't explain it at all because of the lack of auditing in the system and have to tell them the system lacks auditing and therefore blah blah.

So today I had to compose yet another of those messages, to a wide audience including executive level management. I'm always as diplomatic as possible about it, because apologizing for an inadequate system, beyond my power to upgrade or replace, is delicate work.

Only this time, one of the tech liaisons in the business area replied within a few minutes with ""Wait, there is an audit table for that. Here's all the data.""

I swear, that audit table has never been in the system before today. I checked it immediately and found years worth of data in it, as if it's always been there. There have been no recent patches or updates to the system. I'd know because I'm responsible for those.

I've mulled over posting this story for a few months, now. Due to it being mostly unbelievable (I wouldn't believe it if it hadn't happened to me) I decided to hold off on posting it, but reading through this sub tonight, I decided to go for it.

About two years ago I was in a really rough point in my life. I had given my baby up for adoption and I was divorcing my cheating husband. So in the bathroom of my parents house the door is beside the sink, then the toilet next to the sink, and the bathtub beyond the sink. If you stand in front of the mirror over the sink the bathtub is about three feet to your left. So, I had this bunch of pills in my right hand, counting them, and the bottle in my left hand. I stared at the pills trying to do the math of exactly how many miligrams I was holding. I made up my mind to just do it, and I blinked.

It was just a blink. When I opened my eyes, the pills were gone. I looked at the floor and they were not there or in the sink. I began to panic, instantly regretting what I had just done. I was sure that I had taken the pills and blanked out as some sort of coping mechanism. I backed against the door and sank down to sit and think. I looked across from me at the bathtub and there, in the corner, were the pills in a neat little pile. The corner was behind me and to my left, there was no way I could have put them there and ended up in the exact same position. I remember and intense feeling of vertigo, only mental when I opened my eyes after blinking. It was the most bizzare thing I have ever experienced. I don't know what happened. I don't know how, either. 

I've read about quantum suicide, and I think that may have been what happened, but I am really not sure. It's the greatest mystery of my entire life.

Today at work, we had to drive about an hour outside my city to do some work in a little farming town.

As we were weighing the pros and cons of each, the Supertramp song [""Take the Long Way Home""](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xejo1j_super-tramp-take-the-long-way-home_music#.UWi7NLVQGSl) came on the radio.

Hands down, the weirdest thing that's ever happened to me and I can't explain it.

I've been told to share this here after posting [the story](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/176ob4/reddit_regardless_of_your_opinion_of_the_occult/c82pply) in r/Askreddit.

So, I'm reposting my story. It'd be cool to hear what everyone thinks.

Back in high school, me and my friend had a class that took place in a building situated outside the main school. The building had a fence surrounding it with a gate near the entrance of the classroom. The teacher was always supposed to let the whole class in through that gate. There was another gate way on the other side of the building, but we weren't supposed to enter through that.

Anyway, me and my friend had a class there after lunch one day. We started walking to it a little early, and waited outside the gate. The bell went just as we arrived. By this time, at least half the class should have been there. My friend looked at her watch: exactly the time the class should be starting. Just a side note: absolutely no-one was there. Not even other people in the distance, which was really weird even though classes had started by this time.

We hung around for fifteen minutes, then went to the secretary back at the main school (If I remember correctly, we had some important thing happening in the class that day, which we had to attend and complete in groups, and we were a bit panicky about missing it).

Our obvious thought was that the place where class was taking place had changed and we forgot about it or didn't hear about it. However, the secretary got the teacher on the line and was annoyed. She let us know that the teacher had opened the gate twenty minutes ago and that we were idiots who had been at the wrong gate. No, we weren't.

We went back, and found the gate open. The teacher laughed at us when we told her we had been at the correct gate at the right time. Apparently, the whole class had been where we had been at the time class had started. After class, I spoke to another friend. Coincidentally, she had been on the second story of the building as class was due to start. A window looks out below to the gate that leads to the class. She had seen the entire class going through the right gate at the right time, and she went down and went to class. 

We ended up checking with a lot of people because it sounded crazy. They had all been at the same place we had been at the same time. My friend's watch wasn't wrong or broken (we checked). They had been at the same gate.

A few years ago I was talking on the phone with my girlfriend when I decided to make some chicken nuggets in the oven. So I put the chicken nuggets in the oven at a solid 450 degrees F (roughly 232 C) and set the timer for 15 minutes or so. When the timer went off I opened the oven and took the cooking sheet out and set it on the counter to cool off. It was then that I noticed something, I was so preoccupied with my phone conversation that I completely forgot to put an oven mitt on! The thing is, my hand wasn't burnt to a crisp and had no burn marks. The oven was still on when i noticed and when I went to touch the baking sheet with my hand again I could feel the heat from about 2 inches away. The only person I ever mentioned this to was my girlfriend right after it happened and she just thought it was a really lame joke.

TL;DR I grabbed a hot metal cooking sheet out of a hot oven with my bare hand and wasn't burned.

Then I got to thinking about something that happened when I was a young teenager:

Back in 1996, when I was fourteen years old, I wandered into the local stationary/candy/general store by my house. I started browsing the magazines (because back then I never actually bought anything, I just read it in the store like a delinquent). I was into ghost stories/paranormal shit back then so I picked up some tabloid. It was one of those newspapers where the cover story is usually something like ""Woman in Newark Gives Birth To BatBoy (Exclusive Photos Inside!)""

It must have been around the end of the year/beginning of 1996, because the cover story was a list of predictions that were going to take place that year. It showed a map of the United States and blubs that pointed to where major stories would take place. There were a bunch, but three of them jumped out at me: a blizzard in the mid-atlantic/New England area, a bombing at the Olympics in Athens, Georgia, and a plane crash in the Atlantic Ocean near Long Island. I put the magazine away, bought some candy and put it out of my mind for the time being because as much as I was into the paranormal, I didn't really buy into any real predictions like that.

There was a Blizzard in February of 1996, which was the largest snowstorm in NYC history. Something felt off about it, like there was something I was supposed to remember about it, but I was more focused on the fact that school was canceled for a week and a half. Being fourteen at the time, the fact that the world was covered in snow and the multitude of snowdays given to us took precedence in my thoughts.

Then on July 17, 1996 there was a plane crash off of Long Island. TWA Flight 800. It happened pretty close to where I lived at the time and it was a pretty big crashed (killed 230 people), so it was all over the local news. It suddenly became very clear what was going on. My best friend, Veronica, called me that day and we were chatting on the phone about random shit and then the conversation turned to the news. I took a chance at her calling me crazy and told her at that point what I had read a few months earlier. I told her that the blizzard was the first sign I missed and that there would be a bombing at the Olympics as well. We didn’t know what to make of the weird circumstances but decided to wait and see what happened during the summer games.

Even today, I feel a bit guilty about Flight 800. There’s a big memorial set up at Smith Point County Park Beach, with a list of all the people who died that day. I’ve been to it several times. It’s so eerie walking around there, wondering if I could have done something to prevent it. I was just a kid then though, and I didn’t have much to go on (a blizzard in New England during winter? What are the odds? *rolls eyes*). I’ve been told since then that there were probably several people who read that same tabloid and were in a better position to do something, but it’s still kind of haunting even now. 

I remember watching the parade of nations coming in on opening day during the 1996 Olympic Games. It was this weird feeling of dread, because I knew what was going to happen and I felt like I was watching people walking to their doom. I had no idea how big the attack would be but it was really weird to sit there and watch everyone walk in cheering and to just know in the pit of my stomach that things were going to go horribly wrong. I sat there and prayed everyone would make it out of the situation alive, because there was just so little I could do.

About a week into the games, I got the news—there was indeed a bombing at Centennial Olympic Park—two people died, eleven were injured. I got a call that day from Veronica. She asked me if I saw it, and I was sitting in front of the television, watching the news coverage and told her that yeah, I saw it, and yeah, I knew it would happen. She asked me again how I knew and I told her that all I knew was that I read it somewhere.

Since that day, I’ve tried to go back through the Sun, National Enquirer and any other tabloid-ish magazines I could think of that the stationary store would have stocked. I can’t find that many back copies though, so I haven’t found much of anything in the past decade and a half. I haven’t told many people about this because it was just too weird. I don’t have many explanations for what happened. The only rational way I can explain it (other than the wild idea that these tabloids really do have psychics working for them, oohhh hocus pocus, and all that jazz) might be that since these things were man-made disasters (other than the giant blizzard, but like I said before that wouldn't be too hard to guess) that someone might have caught wind of people high up plotting them, tried to go to the regular newspapers and was written off as a conspiracist and the only newspaper they were able to use to tell the world were these tabloids.

I did have a shrink once who my parents forced me to go to because I was having physical problems the doctors all thought were caused by stress (found out later that I had cuts all through my intestines, I wasn't lying and it wasn't stress, but that’s not important). The shrink was a bit of a Jesus-freak and I’m not sure how he got a counseling license, but I told him about it because the anniversary of Flight 800 was coming up and it was on the news. He got this wary look in his eyes like ‘oh, she’s reeeeally crazy, I’m gonna have to prescribe LOTS of pills for her’ and asked me “So, you think you can see the future, then?” Apparently the belief that one can see the future can be attributed to so many different mental illnesses. I just rolled my eyes at him, because he clearly hadn't been listening to me at all. “No. I don’t think I can see the future. I think I can read.”

",98,26,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix/comments/18su45/child_disappears_from_house_for_2_hours_after/,"This is a doozie, but the details are what make it so crazy so here they are in painstaking detail.  


While this did not happen to me, it happened to a good friend of mine and I have heard the story enough times to be able to faithfully reproduce it here.  I feel as though it is authentic due to the fact such a large number of adults were involved in the search; my friend admits she really doesn't have much of a memory about it and learned the details of the event when she was older from her parents (so it's not the misconception of a child).  I doubt she even knows what reddit is, so I thought I would go ahead and share it here.  For the sake of story telling, we'll call her Jane.


When Jane was 4 her family lived in a suburb with a park nearby.  She had had some health problems related to breathing as a child, and as a result she was very clingy to her mother and almost never left her side.  Jane's family lived in a two story house, and one evening during the summer when just she and her mother were at the house (would have been 94 or 95), she was playing in the living room on the 1st floor.  Her mom left her there for just a few moments to go do something in the kitchen, and upon returning was startled to find her daughter gone, toys still laying on the floor.  Her mom began doing a quick search of the house, assuming Jane had gone upstairs to her bedroom on the 2nd floor.  Her mother called her name and looked for her in her normal hiding spots on both floors, and quickly became worried that her usually arm's length away daughter was not coming at her command.


Her mom considered that perhaps Jane had decided to leave early for their usual evening stroll to the park (even though this would be extremely unusual behavior for Jane), and quickly left the house in that direction.  A few houses down she ran into a neighbor who had just been at the park with her kids who was positive she had not seen Jane on the way back.  Jane's mother became very upset at this point, and the neighbor offered to go back to the house and look for Jane while her mom ran up ahead to make sure she hadn't shown up at the park.  After a quick search of the park, Jane was no where to be found. Jane's mother got on the phone and called her husband, who said he would call the police to report Jane missing and that he was leaving work to come home immediately.  At this point, about 45 minutes had passed since Jane had last been seen.  


The neighbor had gone back to the house and done her best to search for Jane, but had not found her.  Jane's dad arrived home about the same time as several police officers, including the police chief, and everyone again searched the house for almost half an hour.  When Jane did not turn up, and since she had been missing for over an hour now, the police chief ""officially"" declared her missing (or something like that, not 100% sure how it works), not something taken lightly.  They brought the search dog in and let it start getting Jane's scent from her clothes, which were all in her room.  


With all of the police officers, the search dog, several more neighbors, and Jane's mom and dad all in the house, something very strange happened next that no can explain.  The police were about to let the search dog out the front door, when Jane's dad suddenly got a weird feeling that somehow no one had checked the toy fridge in Jane's room that she sometimes hid in.  Even though Jane's mom was positive they had looked, he just had the feeling he needed to check it out.  He went upstairs into her room, and opened the fridge.  Jane was not inside.  


When Jane's dad turned around, he noticed that amidst the chaos the room had been subjected to during the search, Jane's favorite blankie was perfectly laid out on the bed.  He picked it up and she was underneath it, peacefully and silently asleep.  


A). Her breathing problem did not allow her to sleep silently (she often snored, even at age 4) and made her a light sleeper.  She and her mother claim the commotion of the police, the dog getting her scent in her room, and everyone yelling her name should have woken her, and they should have been able to hear her snoring (which she weirdly was not doing).  She awoke immediately as her father shouted ""I found her!""

B).  Her room was obviously meticulously searched several times, even by the police chief himself to confirm they could declare her missing, and no one remembers the blankie being on the bed (in the confusion, the dog handler actually thinks he picked the blankie up to have the dog smell it, but no one can 100% remember)

C).  Jane developed a fear of sleeping with the window open that still affects her today.


I don't know redditors, you tell me.  Seems like some sort of serious glitch. 


**TL;DR** My friend Jane disappears for 2 hours while she is 4, and even after the police chief and search dog don't find her in the her house, her dad gets a feeling she is in her room and mysteriously finds her silently sleeping under her blanket, which her health problems shouldn't have allowed.  

EDIT:  Grammar and general readability 

EDIT 2:  Jane is a friend of mine and we met in college.  I knew her for several years before she told me this story for the first time, and it doesn't really upset her to do so (she was surprised by how upset I became by the end of it, but it just didn't sit well in my head).  She and her family are very religious, perhaps that has helped the cope with/rationalize the experience.  

EDIT 3:  While reading again this morning I realized I forgot the crucial detail that Jane woke up as soon as her father yelled ""I found her!""

I'd like to describe something that happened to me about two years ago and I have no idea how to explain it.

I turned on my computer one morning and I found an image file in the middle of the desktop which hadn't been there the night before (I'm pretty sure of it). Curious, I opened the file - it turned out to be a picture I drew in Paint when I was a little kid, in 1998. My parents have just bought a computer back then, but we had no Internet or games, so I could only draw in Paint then. I don't remember drawing that particular picture but I'm sure I did because it looks just like others I drew around that time (my mom still keeps a box full of them). And according to the file data it really was created in 1998.
But the strange thing is that I have no idea how the file got to my desktop. The computer I used when the file appeared is not the same computer I drew the picture on. I'm sure I didn't copy any files from our first computer - it broke rather suddenly and I remember being sad about losing all my files. These computers have absolutely no connection.

About two years ago I had an experience that seems so insignificant upon first tell that I have never been able to get anyone to care about the story, but that was so truly unexplainable, that to this day I have actually referred to it as a ""glitch in the matrix"":  

About two years ago, I was on vacation, snowboarding with my family at Lake Tahoe.  Getting dressed one morning, I sat down on the edge of my bed to put on my socks.  The pair of socks was rolled up on the bed right beside me.  I picked it up, unrolled it and put one on.  All of a sudden, something distracted me.  I'm not sure anymore if someone called to me from the other room or if I just zoned out for a second, but either way, I was distracted for a moment.  When I came back to putting my socks on, I realized that my right hand was holding my rolled up pair of socks just as it had been before I had opened it, but I was STILL wearing the one sock I had put on.  It was not a different sock, there is no chance there could have been three in the roll, and there were no other socks around nor had there been at any other point.  It is tough to tell this story in a way that truly accounts for how bizarre it was, but the fact is that REALITY literally did a partial reset resulting in the creation of a third sock and I am sure of it.

She takes me into a kind of sewing/craft room in the back of the house and sets me on a table and starts doing her thing.  Turns to grab a new diaper from the bag sitting directly behind her and turns back to me...I'm now laying on the floor.

She heard no thump of me hitting the floor (i was only approx. 2 months old, so I probably couldn't have rolled off under my own power) and I was not crying.  There was nobody else in the room.  

My parents never told me about that incident, but every time I'd go into that house, I'd cry and try to refuse to go in, but I had no real idea why.  Until I was 7 years old, my youngest brother was born.  We pack up the car and drive over to the friend's house and as we pull up, I start hyperventilating.  I don't have asthma and never have, but I basically started having a panic attack.  Really thought I was going to die.  She asked what was the matter and I said I felt really scared for my brother, like something was wrong with him.  

I went inside for a little bit, but it was really, really freaky.  I basically had that panic attack for an hour or so before I started to calm down.  Nothing happened to my brother that day, no glitches, nothing abnormal.  So, the visit ended and we packed up and went home.  

On the way home, I had calmed down and she asked if I remembered why I didn't like that house.  I had no idea.  She explained the original incident and at least I had a reason behind why I hated that house.  To this day, I hate the look of the house, I get completely vibed out just being in the same block as it.  I don' have full blown panic attacks from seeing it, but then again, I don't have to go into it.

The car two cars in front of me was following another car really close. I knew what was going to happen and backed off. As I did the car in front slammed on their brakes. The car following them had to swerve in the median. There was no guardrail and it was all grass. They lost control and skidded all the way over to the other side of oncoming traffic. This caused a huge wreck in the eastbound lane that involved at least 12 cars that I saw wreck. This should have caused a huge pile-up that should have blocked interstate up for a while. My mom was heading that direction at the same time but was about 15 minutes away from that particular section. I called her to tell her to be careful. I asked her the next day if she saw the wreck. She said nothing was there. I looked at all the local news and there was nothing.

This one is weird. I was dreaming that i was part of a group that was gathered to be part of an extraterrestrial initiation, whatever that means, i remember waking up and saying out loud extraterrestrial initiation, because i knew it was the only way to remember it, which is also weird because i never did that before or even occurred to do do it before. Anyways, we were in what looked like a train station, there were shop windows showing really old electronic equipment, like a Norelco cassette tape recorders. It was strange because some folks were looking at those things like if they were really new and modern. These beings which i never saw, told us that the initiation was personal so no grouping with our relatives and that we needed to be pure in mind and body. My wife was there rolling a joint, a typical rebel, nothing uncommon there, The next thing i remember is that we are in a boat rowing, i remember how the oar was attached to boat, there was piece of rusted tin nailed to the wooden frame of the boat and a hook where the oar swivels.
I didn't perceived the aliens as a thereat until i asked them where they landed and the pointed me to the moon and i saw a little red dot there, that changed my perception because i felt it like a total intrusion, how they dared to change the look of the moon!

Next morning i was brushing my teeth and i noticed some brown stains in my hands, but i just ignored them. My wife woke up and she had the same stains, but she freaked, and she freaked out more when i told her my dream. The stains were exactly the type you get if you were manipulating something wet and rusted.
We had brownish marks in our nails and wrinkles in the finger joints and some in the palm of our hands.
She didn't remember dreaming anything abnormal that night

As a child I lived in Mexico for about 3 years with my grandmother.  Her home was very simple and in a very poor neighborhood.  I was about 8 or 9 at the time.  My grandmother's house consisted of a ""living room"" which contained the dining room and her bed, a small fridge and a stove.  That was pretty much her home. 

However, there was another room which I CLEARLY remember, but nobody else does.   Every single time I try to ask about it nobody wants to answer my questions or I am simply ignored.  It is as if they might know what I am talking about but simply do not want to talk about it.  

Either way apparently I am the only person that remembers that there was a door in between the bed and the dining table.  This door led to a set of about 8 stairs and a room that stank of dirt.  The room was full of family pictures and other stuff from my memories.  I distinctly remember doing various things in this room.  I kept my bike in there and would go there everyday to get it and put it back.

Anyway,  the thing I remember the most is a painting on the wall, I was too small to know what it was or who painted it, but one day I asked my mom and she said it was an original ""picasso"" that my uncle had brought home. I remember the picture very clearly but i have not found a picture of it online.  It is a woman wearing red lipstick and a blue cowboy hat.  It was very abstract.  I saw that painting throughout my childhood in that room.  

Fast forward a few years.  I am already in the U.S and I remember the room.  I take a trip to Mexico to see my grandmother, only to find out the room is not there.  Nothing.  

There was a door right where I remember but it led outside, to another house my grandma had built over the years to rent out.  

I asked my grandma about the old room and she did not know what I was talking about.  I asked my mom about the painting, she did not know what I was talking about.  

It is as if the room never existed.  Until my uncle mentioned during a ""small-talk"" conversation that he had once sold an ugly painting of a woman for about 20 bucks to buy beer.  

I wonder if it was the painting I knew during my childhood.

[**Also, here is a view from Google Maps of the property for a better sense of scale.**](http://i.imgur.com/u5scd.jpg)
- - - 


It was 2007, I was in my final year of school and had a close group of friends who I'd spend every waking minute with.


My friends and I had a pretty good hangout for our weekends. Unfortunately, one of our friends fathers had passed away years before and as a result, the huge shed that was built next to his families house was heavily under-utilised.


We made the most of it though and over the last couple of years, we'd managed to convert it into a fantastic guys nest. We had 5 sets of bunk beds as well as a couple fold out beds, a series of trestle tables, TV, projector, fridge, microwave, a couple couches, a fireplace and a whole heap of chairs.


Usually we'd congregate there on a Friday after school and leave Sunday afternoon (or Monday if it were a public holiday or something). We'd bring our computers as well and set up a LAN and trade any new movies/games/TV shows we'd downloaded etc. and also occasionally game as well.


The age groups varied a little as the there was an age gap between the two brothers that owned the property. One was about 4 years older than the other, so it'd normally half of us would be around the age of 17-18 and the other half would be around 23-24 years of age. Being old enough to drive, they'd all generally rock up in their cars and we'd routinely do food runs when we were hungry. They'd all park their cars to the side of the road (as seen in the picture), facing towards a dark paddock that wasn't used for anything.


All in all, there were normally 8-9 of us that would spend the weekend there. Sometimes more if we'd invite someone around, sometimes less if one of the regulars were busy. On this particular night, there were about 8 of us there. 


I remember the night quite vividly to this day. It wasn't long after my birthday in August and was the middle of winter (Australian). We were all sprawled out on the couches/beds watching a movie on the projector when I decided that I needed to take a leak.


It was dark outside, but the house next to the shed always illuminated the yard quite well, allowing anyone who needed to dart out for a quick piss to find a tree to hide behind quite easily. It also allowed a full view of the cars, the trees they were parked under, the fence further on and a small glimpse of the paddock further again.

I stepped out of the shed (the red area's are the doors) and started making my way towards the cars when after only a few paces I stopped and gazed ahead. The distance between the house and the cars would roughly be 15 metres and based on where I was, I would've been approximately 11-12 metres away. 


The reason I stopped was because the older brother was standing ahead, just in front of the cars. He was facing the towards the cars so I could only see him from behind. I still distinctly remember him standing there, wearing a brown beanie, a yellow/brown fleece jumper, khaki cargo shorts and brown shoes. I remember thinking it was odd because it was a cold night. Cold enough for the rest of us to be wearing jeans/hoodies, yet there he was in shorts.

I watched him for maybe 5 seconds before he started to move. He walked between two of the cars under the trees and then started walking left, past the rest of the cars and into the darkness. I lost sight of him and was left a little puzzled.

Now, the older brother was a bit of a social outcast. He was always awfully quiet - to the point where half the time you would forget he was even in the room. He'd also often do strange things that a few of us would have a quiet chuckle about to our own discretion.


Puzzled and a little uncomfortable, instead of taking a leak, I turned around and walked maybe 5-6 steps back, standing at the entrance of the shed. I glanced to my left (to where all the bunks/seats were) in search of the younger brother.

*""Hey man, what the fuck is your brother doing, walking around the cars?""* I remarked.


The guys did nothing look back at me confused and before they had a chance to say anything, I hear a voice coming from my right.


*""I'm right here?""*


I froze. According to my friends, I also turned white. I felt like time slowed down as I slowly craned my neck and turned my head to the right - only to see the older brother standing at the fridge situated in the corner, casually looking for something to eat/drink.


He's staring at me with a bemused look and sure enough - he's wearing a brown beanie, a yellow/brown fleece jumper, khaki cargo shorts and brown shoes.


I was generally the one to joke around and play pranks back when we all hung out, but the tone of my voice and the expression on my face as I retold the last minute of my life left no doubt in any of the 7 other individuals minds. 


Our group has drifted apart over the years though and although none of us hang out any more, we all keep in touch every once in a while. One of the tales that routinely pops up is this one, and we all seem to agree that something happened that night - something not any of us will ever understand.",,False,,t5_2tcwa,False,,,True,t3_12nl2u,http://www.reddit.com/r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix/comments/12nl2u/my_one_and_only_encounter_with_a_glitch_seeing_my/,

This is where it gets strange.
I start to walk toward the kitchen, but in the periphery of my right eye, I see gallons of water silently cascading down our stairs from no apparent source. Coming from nowhere, literally appearing at the top of the stairs from thin air. It happened for about 6 seconds, then ceased. I freaked the fuck out and started trying to see where it came from.

This literally just happened. I was biking back home from downtown and had started just started to climb up the hill that leads to my apartment when a homeless native looks at me, and starts muttering nonsense and walking my way. As this happens, a jogger passes on my left: she has blue shorts, a sports bra, and short red blond hair. My chain almost immediately falls off when I hit the slope, and I get up to remount the chain. I start peddling again, the chain falls off again. I adjust the gears, remount the chain again, and the chain falls off for the third time. All the while, the homeless native man walks slowly closer, and I hear him mumble something along the lines of ""you're in the twilight..."" This is maybe a little unnerving, but it's an everyday occurrence where I live. I remount my chain for a third time, and continue biking up the hill.

Now this is where it gets weird: I see the same jogger coming down the hill again! The sidewalk only runs on one side of the street, and that hill was the only access to the other side of the interstate for about a half mile radius. With the traffic the way it was, there's no way she could have even got a car ride back to the top of the hill in that time, and nobody passed me on the sidewalk when I was fixing my bike. So by all appearances, I either saw into the future, or went back in time.

She told me that yesterday, my uncle had shot and killed all three kids, himself, and his ex-wife. I found the article online, and it said that it happened when the parents were meeting up to exchange the kids, and that their bodies were found at around 9 PM, but it was speculated to have happened around 4:30 PM. I had the thoughts at 4:42 PM. I've never told anyone in my family what happened to me, for the fear of them thinking that I was just trying to turn something so horrific into me trying to get attention was far too much. I've never believed in psychics or weird telepathic connections, but this incident has always bothered me.

It was getting kind of stormy so we didn't want to get soaked before we reached my house. The park is basically a huge open field with dense trees and bushes on two sides.

  
Halfway through the park my friend notices that it sounds like it's raining but when we stop to check none of us are wet. We shrug it off and keep walking until my other friend and I defiantly hear rain fall around us. We stop and looked around but again neither us nor the grass we were standing on were wet. Then suddenly we stop hearing the rain and the wind died off. We waited a few seconds and took a few steps and we hit wet grass, we turned around to check and the grass was soaked all around us except for about a 10 foot circle that the three of us were inside of. 


We turned around to check the entrance of the park we came from and sure enough puddles and soaked trees everywhere. We went back to my house and we found the same thing.

My next door neighbors went out of town this weekend for a funeral and asked me to watch their black lab for them, and I agreed. I took the dog (Louie) and my dog (Wilson) for a walk at around 9pm around the circle. When I left, I left the garage door unlocked and the door to the house locked (Basically, you opened the garage door, walked through the garage, and there was another door to get into the house). I live in a very nice neighborhood in a town with very low crime rates, and I don't think there's ever been any sort of crime on my street whatsoever. 

Anyways, back to the story. I take the dogs out the garage door and walk around the circle of our street, which takes me about 20 minutes. I finish and I only saw one car the entire walk, and that car turned into a driveway down the street. I come back to the neighbor's house and push on the garage door, but it doesn't budge. My first thought was that I must be confused and that this was the wrong door. I took a step back and looked around -- it's definitely the right door. I push again and something seems to be giving way. I look in through the crack of the door and I see that there's some sort of piece of furniture with shelves blocking the way. I keep pushing and finally get the door open. It turns out that not only was this piece of furniture blocking the doorway, but so was a plank of wood. I turned the light on and I know that's definitely the way I came in. I pushed the shelf back to where I thought it went, but the shelf was very heavy and wasn't put together well, so it was difficult and I couldn't get it all the way back. At this point, I'm really freaked out, because the only logical explanation my brain could provide was that someone was inside the house. I got really freaked out because here I am, inside my neighbor's garage with two dogs and my ipod. I opened the door to the house and everything was the same inside. One of the house owners actually left her credit card on the kitchen counter and it was still there, as well as multiple other valuable things. There were no signs that anyone had entered the house, especially since I only saw one car that went to another house and no one out walking. All other doors were locked and there is only one way out of the garage and that's the door that was blocked. the door opens in, so there's no logical way that someone could have pushed those things in front and then left through that door. In addition, there is very little airflow in the garage, and there's certainly not enough to make a large, heavy shelf move most of the way in front of the door. I was gone for 20 minutes.

I was sitting on the bus, and a girl got on after me, with her iPod on playing loudly. I heard a snatch of the song, it was 'Wuthering Heights's chorus. OK, not so bad, just a coincidence. My first stop is McDonalds, just to grab a coffee for the boss. What do I hear? 'Wuthering Heights' playing over their speakers. At this point, I was amused.

After work, I headed to the ASDA, which is the British Wal-Mart, and what do I hear? Some little girl singing the song with her teenage brother. Then, walking through the shopping centre to get to my house, I pass by a store that sells televisions, all of them turned on. One guess as to what was displayed on two of them. The music video for 'Wuthering Heights'. Finally, I get home. I turn on my own television, planning to plop down on the sofa with a cup of tea. Who shows up on my screen? Not Kate Bush, but Sarah Hapland, a British actress. Why is this significant? Well, this actress stars in 'Horrible Histories', a show that involves a musical parody of a popular song, with lyrics befitting a historical ruler in each episode. One such song was 'Queen Mary the First', a parody of 'Wuthering Heights'.

My best friend at the time and I used to have a band that practiced in a pool house outside of his home. His parents were cool with us using the place during the cold months, but when it warmed up and they used the pool they also used the pool house in order to throw parties and such. 

After one Such party, we were given the task of cleaning up the pool house in order to have our band practice there later that day. We spent a good 3 hours cleaning up, it was an awful mess. We had to mop and wipe up everything, someone had spilled some Sunkist or something, and we had to collect all of the garbage. While we worked, we just talked about dumb things like girls and music. When we were finally done, we each grabbed one of the huge industrial sized garbage bags (these people really like to party) an stepped outside of the pool house to go dispose of them.

 We were deep in discussion about a new band's album that had just come out, and we never discussed a place to dispose of these bags. So we stepped outside of the pool house an then... That was it. The conversation never missed a beat, it never halted or stalled but all of a sudden we were in front of the pool house without any garbage bags. I didn't even notice they were gone at first, until he asked me 'wait, what did we do with that trash?'


I genuinely didn't know.


We assumed we had just gotten lost in conversation and had put them somewhere, so we started looking. They were nowhere to be found. 

Absolutely no where.

I just texted him to confirm this story, and even though it happened over a year ago and we don't even speak any more, he says he still remembers it clearly because it was so weird.

it was the the first thursday of a new semester and i was invited to a party at a friend's place.  while on break, i had found my old boy scout hat and this cool blue hoodie with earbuds inside orange drawstrings.  naturally i had to strut this bad boy combo at a party.

i am not really good at parties.  i tend to have wall-floweric tendencies and thus sometimes resort to amusing myself otherwise.  tonight i decided not to drink and i thought it might be interesting to see what would happen if i pretended i was passed out/asleep.  i found a couch, slouched down, jacket on, and tilted my hat over my eyes.

i stayed like this for a while, but peak up once.  just as i did i noticed a friend of mine, Al who takes pictures of himself infront of things, framing one up with his phone, me as the subject.  i humored him and got up when  i was sure he got it.

that sunday (8th) i got sick and had to stay in hospital for a week.  when i came back, i went to another party with the same crowd of people.  Al was there, so i decided to ask if he still had the picture of me from two thursdays ago.  He looked at me strange and told me he had a picture of me, but it was from a party two saturdays ago, at which, i was absolutely hammered.  i had not been drinking that night and i don't recall going to a party that saturday, so i was quite confused.  but he still had the picture and showed it to me.  

in the picture was him in front, and me in the background, apparently passed out/asleep on the couch.  the jacket was there, but it was draped over my lap, and the hat was absent from the photo completely.  i asked if i could check the date of the picture, and sure enough it read saturday (7th).

this was all on his phone and the quality of the picture was crappy, very streaky/grainy/blurry, so i'm fairly certain no photo editing software was involved, unless Al is secretly the master mind fucker.

I’d been out running errands, shopping, etc. and had just returned home. I had to rush to unlock and open the door because the phone was ringing. It was my father on the phone asking me if I’d just called his house. I told my father no that I’d been out all morning and had just returned home. I told him I’d not tried to call him at all that day. My father asked me if I was joking, I assured him I was not. My father told me to stop joking around and asked me why I’d been calling he and mom over and over “playing tricks”. I asked him what on earth he was talking about.  My father then told me this..  Someone that sounded exactly like me had been calling his house asking to speak to me and when he asked the caller who she was she insisted she was me. The caller became upset when informed that I wasn’t there. The caller wouldn’t tell my father why she needed to speak to me, just that she knew I should be there and she really needed to speak to me and for my father to tell me to get on the phone.  The woman called multiple times, spoke to my father and my mother asking to speak to me. She wouldn’t tell them what she wanted beyond that she really needed to speak to me. The caller continued to insist she was me and continued to ask for me. My parents, tired of what they thought was me joking around, told the caller (each time she called) to stop calling and hung up on her. The last time she’d called was right before my father called me at my house.  My parents are both ex-military and they’re not easily rattled but once they understood (and believed) that it really wasn’t me that had called them they seemed to be confused and upset. They both insisted the caller sounded exactly like me.  They’d both been so convinced that it was me that neither of them had thought to suggest the caller call my home or provide my phone number so she could contact me at my home.  This was before cell phones were common and before my parents had caller ID on their home phone so there wasn’t anyway for them to find out the number of whoever called them that day. Who the caller was and the reason for the calls remains a mystery to this day.  I occasionally half wonder if future (or past) me attempted to call my past (or future) self at my parents house that day. I’m date challenged and don’t always remember or calculate dates properly. Perhaps I screwed up the math and tried to call past (or future) me at my parent’s home when I wasn’t there? That seems like something I’d do.

I especially hated them, because my mom would never let me wear what I wanted. Well, this specific year I finally got my way and was allowed to wear my bright pink powerpuff girls tshirt. After the pictures arrived in the mail, my mom made a big deal about mailing them to all her friends and family.

That same year, around Christmas now, we're visiting family in Illinois when a family friend (my mom's best friend's brother) offers to take my sister and me ice-fishing. So we head out to this pristine lake in the middle of some woods that look like something straight from a holiday greeting card, and naturally, being a seven year old, I wander off. I was lost in the woods for maybe fifteen minutes, but to my panic-stricken mind, it feels like hours. I'm crying, frozen snot dripping down my face, and come across a fallen tree. I decide to sit it out and wait for someone to find me. Sticking out from beneath this log is a manilla envelope, about 8x10 in size. Even though snow is everywhere, and the ground beneath it is soaked, this envelope is only moist at the edges and on the back (the paper beneath it still crisp, not soggy or floppy) like it only been on the ground under this tree for minutes.

I open it, and lo and behold, it's my family portrait taken a month before. The portrait is in perfect shape, with not a crinkle in it, except for one major flaw. All our faces, (my mom, my dad, my brother, my sister, and myself) are burned through, as if scorched by a cigarette. There's my pink powerpuff girls shirt. My mom's handwriting giving the date is on the back, along with her signature. When the family friend found me, he didn't know I had the envelope. I tucked it into my coat with the intention of showing my mom.

Upon returning back to the family friend's house, I give the envelope to my mother in private. She never mailed her friend a copy of the portrait because she didn't have enough copies and thought what her friend didn't know wouldn't hurt her. My mom was undeniably upset and decided she was going to confront her friend about the portrait in the morning, and locked the envelope in our car for safe-keeping. That night, our car was broken into and stolen. We never saw the car again, but about a year later, the portrait was mailed back to us from a PO box in Michigan with no return-sender's name given, just a sticky note with the words ""In the morning"" stuck to it.

This idea kinda came to me through some deep thought. I think everyone has pre-cognition. Now of course if everyone did have this every time we all had something inherently bad coming, no one would die in 'accidents'.
 But this is where the alternate realities comes in. We will not experience our individual deaths in an 'accident'. Each of us is either in a reality that we live our full lives or we move between ones till we find that eventuality.
 This however doesn't include those around us. I have had many friends that had died from 'accidents'. We see this because they are not apart of our full life. They however have switched over to an alternate reality from ours in which they are still alive continuing just as we are but on a different path.
I have been in many situations where I felt my choices have put me in deaths path before and, through what I guess would be called a glitch here, I have gotten out against all odds. I probably died in the reality I was in but found the one reality that happened to get me out of it. Thus is how I am typing this now.

to time because of some unexplained occurrences in my life and enjoyed reading other 
people's experiences. I created this account just for Glitch. I will submit different 
posts for other events but I will start with this one.

It was just a few weeks before Father's Day, 2011. I had taken a job as an onsite 
manager that provided a rent free apartment, utilities, and internet at the start of 
2011. I was very reluctant to accept this position but I did because it was the only way  I could afford housing for my wife, daughter, and I while allowing her to be a stay at  home mother and attend school online fulltime.

Prior to this job I was layed off from a great job with a Fortune 100 company that  resulted in my family losing our home and both of our vehicles being repossessed. A few months prior to that our daughter was born and just a few months before that my wife had been layed off. It was an eventful 2010, let me tell you!

Back to the event. I had constantly been judged and ridiculed by a fellow site manager  and was always being compared to this individual by upper management as the employee I needed to emulate. After about 9 months of this type of environment I was beginning to feel like complete shit. Worthless, inexperienced, unintelligent and pretty much treated like a second rate employee. I did my job well and never complained. Just went home to my loving wife and daughter every night and enjoyed my family. There came a night when my wife had mentioned that she wanted to start watching this talent show on TV so I thought I would be a hero and run to Target after work and by an antenna for our TV, the apartment did not have cable.

I mentioned this to said fellow manager and he began to brag about the steal he got at  Target for some rabbit ears, $10 or somewhere around there. I took his advice and headed  to Target. After searching the electronics section for about 15 minutes I asked an  employee to help me find the cheap $10 set. Well I was not able to find any because the  shelves were empty so I asked for whatever they might have had in stock. Only one set,  around $17. Now I am supremely frustrated and only have $20 in my account and thought I could grab some quick food for my wife and I. Things were looking down and I was feeling pretty miserable. All over a damn antenna. With everything building in the past year or so it all came to a head. Right in that aisle in Target. I wanted to kill myself and was actually considering how to leave this world. I was close to crying, believe it or not. I get home, plug in the antenna and my wife and I watch some TV. I never told anybody about that episode in Target, not even the other manager. 

The next day my mother in law  had taken it upon herself to surprise my wife and I with a resort stay for Father's Day.  We were ecstatic and headed on our way while our daughter stayed the weekend with my  mother in law. Everything was amazing, as to be expected, pools, spas, food, etc. Well  it comes time to check out and we get into my truck when I noticed something stuck under my wiper blade. It turned out to be a bunch of one dollar bills folded up and green  stick it note that had REMEMBER THE ANTENNA written on it. My wife thought it was pretty sweet that we just made $17 lol. I, on the other hand, was  having a silent brain meltdown because I was the only person that knew what had happened at Target. My receipt, and antenna box went right into the trash, wife did not see the price, no bank account with online banking to check balances...nothing. Now the  handwriting on the note was identical to how I would have written it, I copied it over  and over just out of curiosity. I actually still have the note in my glove box just  because it was so bizarre. 

Any ideas from you guys on what the hell just happened?!
Thanks for sticking with me on this one hehe.  

 TL;DR	Depressed, spent money, depressed, made it all back. No clue as to how.

So philosophically, the universe and everything in it does indeed revolve around us, as our singular experience of life is all we have. The only thing that really matters to us is our personal experiences. Everything else is completely external observation and only subject to our own individual interpretation.

Which led to a discussion on quantum realities - parallel universes as an individual reality. I explained to her that I have probably died several times, but my reality is riding a parallel string where I'm still alive; that there may be many strings of reality where I have died and others have moved on (personal note: In my life, I've been shot through the head once, and t-boned on a motorcycle at 60 mph another time, so that's two deaths I should have claimed). I said ""The way I see it, when we die in one string, our personal reality is simply carried on by another string where we survived the death incident. And so it goes.""

The next day, it was beginning to rain as I drove to work and the roads were becoming quite slippery. I made a quick lane change into the right lane and noticed two things; the light ahead had turned red, and there was a fully loaded semi truck bearing down on me, full speed.

I remembered reading an article about how we often miscalculate the stopping distance of a truck on the highway with a full load. I kinda scrunched my eyes waiting for a rear-end collision, as I maneuvered a quick right-on-red at the intersection to avoid the inevitable wreck.

As I approached the turn, I looked again in my rearview and there was no truck to be seen anywhere - as if it had simply vanished. As I was going quite slow, I had a lot of time to assess my situational awareness, and the truck was nowhere to be seen.

I came into work that day and told her about it. ""So, there's a parallel string going on right now where you guys are wondering why I'm late for work, and I'm lying dead under a truck.""

Tuesday morning was just like every other morning, I go through my morning routine and head out the door to work. I get in my car and head down the road on my way to work. I stayed up later than normal the night before so my morning drive was one of those ""unconscious"" routes where you are not really paying attention but you know exactly where you are going. So I'm heading into town and, in my tired state, I stay straight instead of veering to the right at the first stop light. (This isn't a problem though because I just have to go over an extra block to continue on my route).  After that minor mistake, things started to get weird.

The road that I was on was the Main Street in my town so it sees a pretty good amount of traffic, especially around 7:45am. There was a good amount of space between me and the car in front of me and when that car went through the second traffic light, it turned yellow so I was the first one in line. This is a busy intersection in both directions and as the cars were crossing I noticed that not one car turned west (the direction I was going) or east (the direction I came from). Thinking nothing of it, I drive through the intersection as the light turns green.  This is when i think the glitch was in full effect.

Two blocks ahead is a skate/snowboard shop that I have been going to since the late 90s and every time I drive by the shop I look into the windows, whether it's 7am, noon, or midnight. As I pass the second light everything got gradually quieter and I saw that there was not a car in sight ahead of me or coming towards me, although there were cars parked on the side of the road. I get to the second block and, just like every other time, I look into the shop, but what I saw shocked me. I look to me left and I see myself in the window flipping the closed sign to open! Me, standing in the window, wearing normal clothes and every light is on in the shop. My jaw drops. time seems like it is in slow motion and as I keep driving I just stare at myself until my neck couldn't turn any further. It was probably for a good 4 or 5 seconds in real time. Realizing that I should look at the road I turn my head back around and, boom, I'm back at the second light! However, instead of me being first in line, I was third in line behind a grey sedan and a red pick-up. Traffic seemed to be normal again, but the other weird thing is that my music was muted, and I have no explanation for it. It is always on, always playing unless I mute it to take a phone call. I continue on my route and as i look into the show for the second time, it is closed. it was 7:40am at the time and they don't open until 10.  I drive the rest of the way to work in silence, thinking about what had just happened and have been trying to find an answer ever since.

Anyhow, I was using Skype before, and I took my contacts off that and put them onto my phone, then texted one of my buddies. I got back something like ""I think you got the wrong number, this is notyourfriend.""

Long story short, I had the wrong number programmed into Skype for the last 2 years. The weird part is, while we aren't super close, I did call him several times over those years. I just checked the logs, and we've had at least a few short conversations over the years, mostly to arrange meetups to play disc golf, from my recollection.

So somehow I've been calling the wrong number for the last two years, but managed to get my friend on the other line just the same. It wasn't until I texted the number today that it stopped working.

Randomly found this subreddit a while back.  Figured this video might be an interesting watch for you guys and gals.  Certainly makes me wonder...


About the video (Copy pasta via youtube description):  ""Ever since he was two years old and first started talking, Cameron Macauley has told of his life on the island of Barra. Cameron lives with his mum, Norma, in Glasgow. They have never been to Barra.

He tells of a white house, overlooking the sea and the beach, where he would play with his brothers and sisters. He tells of the airplanes that used to land on the beach. He talks about his dog, a black and white dog.

Barra lies off the western coast of Scotland, 220 miles from Glasgow. It can only be reached by a lengthy sea journey or an hour long flight. It is a, distant, outpost of the British Isles and is home to just over a thousand people.

Cameron is now five, and his story has never wavered. He talks incessantly about his Barra family, his Barra mum and Barra dad. His Barra dad he explains was called Shane Robertson and he died when he was knocked down by a car.

He has become so preoccupied with Barra and is missing his Barra mum so badly that he is now suffering from genuine distress.

Norma considers herself to be open-minded, and would like to find out if there is any rational explanation for Cameron's memories and beliefs that he was previously a member of another family on Barra. Her first port of call is Dr. Chris French, a psychologist who edits The Skeptic magazine which debunks paranormal phenomena. Not surprisingly, he discounts any talk of reincarnation mooting that a child's over-active imagination can be fed by the multitude of television programmes available and the easy access to the Web. Norma is not convinced, she does not believe that Cameron has ever watched programmes that could have provided this information.

Norma's next step is a visit to Karen Majors, an educational psychologist whose speciality is children and their fantasy lives. She considers that Cameron's accounts are very different to normal childhood imaginary friends.

It has become clear to Norma that there are no easy answers to the questions thrown up by Cameron's memories. Cameron has asked, persistently, to be taken to Barra. Norma has finally decided to make that journey.""",,False,,t5_2tcwa,False,,,True,t3_zpvj2,http://www.reddit.com/r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix/comments/zpvj2/the_boy_who_lived_before_documentary/,

I feel the sinking feeling of the elevator going up, and hear it ding twice, for the second and 3rd floor. However, the doors never open. She looks at me confused, and I look at the current floor display, which reads ""Floor 1"". I ask her if we just moved up, and she confirms that we had indeed moved up all 3 floors. She then says ""Crap, I hope the elevator didn't break."", then presses ""3"" again, expecting the door to open...

The doors open, and we're standing on the third floor, with people waiting to get in.

In June 2001, Laura Buxton (almost 10) released a red balloon into the air over her hometown of Stoke-on-Trent in Staffordshire, England. On one side of the balloon, she had written “Please return to Laura Buxton,” and on the other side, her home address. A few weeks later, a man 140 miles away in Milton Lilbourne found the balloon stuck in the hedge that separated his farm from the next-door neighbors. He noticed Laura Buxton’s name and address and immediately took the balloon to the neighbors’ house, showing it to the 10-year-old girl who lived there…whose name was also Laura Buxton.

Laura Buxton from Milton Lilbourne wrote Laura Buxton from Stoke-on-Trent to let her know that she’d found the balloon. Thinking this coincidence was simply too amazing to be true, they decided they had to meet in person. And that’s when things got really weird.

On the day of the meeting, the two girls wore essentially the same outfit – a pink sweater and jeans. The girls were the same height, which was unusual because they were both tall for their age. They both had brown hair and wore it in the same style. They both had three-year-old black Labrador Retrievers at home, as well as gray pet rabbits. They both brought their guinea pigs, which were the same color and even had the same orange markings on their hindquarters. It was almost as though these two Laura Buxtons were the same person.

The strange events surrounding their meeting helped the girls form a strong bond. Both felt the circumstances that brought them together were too significant to write off as mere coincidence.

I go around the kotatsu and there is the bottle on the carpet, so now i have two bottles.

My sister, who was sixteen at the time, was going to junior prom that night. My mom took pictures of her with her date, and a few other friends and then they all left. She told us she would be back at about midnight. I was home for the night with my mom. We had dinner and then put on the movie “Doctor Zhivago,” and watched the whole thing (it’s quite a long movie) until close to midnight. By that point in time my mom had dozed off on the couch, and I was alone watching the credits roll. 

Suddenly, I heard a loud knock on our back door. Since it was close to the time when my sister said she’d be home, I figured it was her and she had forgotten to bring her keys. I got up and made my way over to the door, and the knocking persisted. It was rather dark in our apartment, so I thought she was worried that my mom and I were both asleep. I said rather loudly, “Hold on, I’m coming!” 

The knocking continued until I reached the door. When I finally got there, I looked out the small window just to make sure it was her. I could see her standing there looking just as she did when she’d left the house; with her hair done up in curls and wearing the same blue dress and silver necklace. She was looking away to her right, towards the back yard. 

I unlocked the door, and swung it open—and she wasn’t there. I stood there for a moment in confusion, thinking that she’d gone down the back steps for some reason. We lived in a very old building with creaky wooden stairs so I thought I would have heard her walking down them, if that was the case. However, it was completely silent. I stepped outside and called her name. No answer. I went down the steps and around the corner and called for her again. Still nothing. I even went out into the alley to see if I could find her. She just wasn’t there. Feeling reasonably freaked out by this point, I booked it back up the stairs and shut the door. 

I called her shortly after and asked her if she’d just been home. She was very confused and told me no, that she wouldn’t be home for about another half hour and was at her friend’s house. I went to bed and heard her come in not too long after. I still don’t know what the hell happened. I’ve told people and they said I possibly just imagined the entire thing, but I can honestly say I’ve never had any other instances like it in my life.  It really freaked my sister out though when I told her about it in greater detail. 

So yes, that’s my own little “glitch.”

We were fighting all the time because of parental drama.  My mom had to move into this tiny two - bedroom apartment (she worked at a toy store, minimum wage), and couldn't afford more.  My brother and I shared a room, no biggie, we put a barricade up in the bedroom to have a bit of privacy (standing bookshelf and a sheet).

To try to make the transition to a tiny apartment easier my mom ordered cable TV.  We had been poor (Dad was a teacher, mom just finishing college/ working part time) and we'd never had cable before. It was pretty exciting and we had free HBO for a month.  Brother and I were really stoked abut the TV situation.  

I walk home from school one day, brother won't be home for at least an hour, I get the TV all to myself! Yay! I kick off my shoes and turn the TV on, it's a creepy movie about demons possessing a little girl (2:30 in the afternoon, yikes!)  I'm pretty freaked out, so I hit the channel up button. Same movie, really creepy, so I click the number 5 + enter (local NBC channel) but it's the same freaking movie, same scene.

I rolled over onto my back, and noticed her ceiling lamp, which I had never really seen before. 

That lamp was sparkling and scintillating like something out of a movie about heaven. It was shining brilliantly, I could see a carousel turning between the spears of golden light, and I clearly heard clear, soft music playing, as if a music box were concealed in it...it was like a supernatural Christmas decoration, some arcane magical automaton that I had never noticed before. The light was shining across most of the ceiling, with every indication of being real.

I lay there transfixed, staring at it; finally my mother called me from the kitchen, and when I returned it was just an ordinary light again. I've seen it since, it's a very prosaic iron chandelier like you'd find in many 1970s-era houses. 

Later I asked my grandmother if she could make the light play music for me again, and of course she had no idea what I was talking about. I thought of it as musical for a long, long time.

I'm not sure how ""glitchy"" this one is, but when I was around 10 or so I was helping my Dad clean up the attic and I found some old computer speakers.  
They're the kinda that took about 2 C Batteries for power, however they had none in them because they didn't work.

This is where it gets odd: I was holding the speakers with the speaker plug dangling on the floor when the power light on them started flickering and they started playing an unknown radio station.  
I cannot recall what was on the station and not long after it just stopped and these battery-less speakers became lifeless again.  
No attempts to recreate it worked, so, pretty strange.

My other one is a lot more recent and I feel is more ""glitchy"": I was visiting the new public library in town for the first time a few years ago and checking it out when I went to see what the Kid's Section was like.
It was fairly normal, Aquariums, Hamsters, Computer area, Books, Librarians, etc.

However in the back of the room was this large wooden Pirate Ship thing that you might see in a playground.  
It was really dark in that area and the area gave me a really uncomfortable feeling, like something is just really off.  
No kids were playing on it either, even though the place was fairly packed since the place had pretty much just opened.

Later on I come back to get some books(Discworld if you're wondering, not sure why they think it to be for the Kid's Section) and I found that area is no longer there.  
It's just a wall with bookshelves against it.

3 years later, a few weeks back, I was driving to a concert talking on the phone with that same girl.  I was asking her if she was coming to the concert, but she couldn't because she was driving to Nordstrom for work.  I told her to just come to the concert instead, especially because there was a fire going to happen Nordstrom and it wouldn't be safe to go to, and I was completely joking.

I'm not sure what it was about, but here's the gist:
A certain strange situation unfolds before OP's eyes, eventually causing him to die. Then it's like he wakes up, and after a while the strange situation happens again, but this time it's not killing him.
There was this guy who had a theory that whenever you die, your conciousness lives on, but somehow in a different universe, like it 'jumps'. So you can't really die. This time, the guy was able to witness the process because of a glitch.

He/She said it was a very vivid dream (Look it up, I can't remember the name. It was in Top posts of all time.)








I don't know if this story belongs here, as it seems to be some sort of glitch (In my opinion). 








This is about a dream I had about three years ago.  I don't normally remember my dreams very well (tidbits of this and that), but this dream was extremely vivid and I remember pretty much every detail.







I know I was not the person in this ""Dream"".







I woke up at about seven in the morning, it was a Wednesday I believe.  I stumbled out of bed and went to take a shower, but before entering the shower I looked in the mirror, I was a man in my early thirties or late twenties (I was 17 at the time).  My skin was darker than mine in real life.  I did my daily morning routine, it felt so natural like I knew where everything was but had never been in this apartment before.  It was like I was aware of who I was and what I was doing, but not aware this was a dream... If that makes sense.






I left my apartment and said hello to my neighbor who was taking his morning smoke while drinking his coffee.  I made my commute to work, it was a large city with crammped streets and people were walking everywhere (New York City maybe?).  I had an office job at a computer, pretty boring stuff in a small cubicle.







After that it goes black, I can't remember anything else up until...






I hear muffled voices and I can't see a thing, I think I have a bag over my head.  I am lying down and my hands are bound, but I have enough room to move, I think I'm in the back of a van.  I hear the doors open and they pull me out.  The door of the van closes and when it shuts there is a large echoe, like I was in a warehouse.






They walk me a few feet and sit me down in what feels like one of those metal fold up chair they use in large events like a makeshift church or AA meetings...  I can't remember what they were saying it's all a blur, I know there were multiple people talking.  I had the strongest feeling that one of them was a police officer, I don't know why.






After awhile of them talking, I hear them walk closer. One man says a few more things and puts what I know is a gun to the right side of my head, where my parietal lobe is. I can hear the boom of the gun and I could feel the bullet hit my head. It didn't hurt or anything. 






As soon as the bullet hit my head, the darkness from the hood slowly crept in light, I thought it was heaven. I woke up as soon as the light became very bright. I felt like I was just sucked out of...something, I don't know.






So that's it, sorry for the lengthy introduction.

She was elderly and under hospice care, but we had set up a hospital bed in the living room so she could stay at home.  Earlier in the day her skin had started to take on a mottled appearance and her breathing had developed a ""death rattle"", and I called the hospice nurse and she came and said that the dying process had begun in earnest, and that my mother would probably only be around until the next morning.  We all said our goodbyes.  The hospice nurse gave me some kind of liquid morphine substance (if I recall correctly) to give to my mother once every two hours to ease her breathing, and stop the rattling noise.

About 11:30 PM I started a load of dishes in the dishwasher.  The dishwasher is built into a countertop that forms a divider between the kitchen and the living room.  My mother's hospital bed was on the other side of that divider.  My computer was in another room, and a few months earlier the hospice people had loaned me a baby monitor, so that I could hear if my mother needed assistance.  The transmitter (microphone) was sitting on that countertop next to her hospital bed.  I knew I had to give her another dose of the liquid morphine at midnight and she appeared to be sleeping relatively peacefully (as she had pretty much done for the previous three or four days) so I decided to go check my e-mail and look at a few things on my computer.

Just before midnight, the baby monitor receiver in my room started beeping loudly, sort of like Morse code though not in any specific pattern.  It shocked me because it had never done that before and it was a very distinctive, loud beeping sound.  After just a moment to process what had just happened and figure out what was making that sound, I got up and headed out into the kitchen, only to discover that the dishwasher motor seemed to be making a squealing noise, again something it had never done before, and the baby monitor was probably picking that up as a kind of beeping noise.  I then realized it was almost exactly the stroke of midnight (I am not making this up) and I went around the counter to check on my mother.  I leaned close to her face to listen for her breath and she took one final gasp of air and that was it, she was gone.  The only thing I could figure is that she had wanted me to be by her side at the moment of physical death.  There was nothing spooky or creepy about it; I had been her primary caregiver for several months, and knew that her death was close, but because of what the hospice nurse had said I wasn't expecting it until sometime later in the day.

The dishwasher only made the squealing noise (like metal rubbing on metal, or a bad bearing or something) for about two or three minutes and then stopped, and never made that sound for that duration again.  Occasionally it would make a very short squeal after that, but it was a very old dishwasher and was already on its last legs so I finally replaced it.  But only that one time did it ever make a prolonged set of intermittent squeals.  Could it have been coincidence?  I suppose, but if so it was a heck of a coincidence, and when I heard the beeping on the baby monitor I just knew that wasn't normal, and that I needed to go out to the kitchen/living room area right then to see what was causing it.

(might be long),86,20,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix/comments/1g1lxn/i_jumped_higher_than_i_should_have_might_be_long/,"Several months ago, I was playing a game of basketball and was running down the court on a fast break. Almost out of instinct, I turned my head and noticed a ball flying towards me from around half court, way over my head. It was traveling parallel to the sidelines and headed straight for some bleachers (out of bounds) next to the basket. I think everyone, including the guy who was passing me the ball, felt it was just gonna be another turnover and I was the only one who hadn't noticed yet. I can't tell you how high up it was, but the ball must have been at least 12 feet (3.7m) in the air. Don't take anything I say here as bragging, but if it were ten feet or fewer, I likely would have grabbed it no problem. For reference, the top of a regulation backboard is 13 feet (4m) and the rim is 10 feet (3m). In my mind, I believed that I was just jumping up for another routine catch/rebound, but the reaction of a few people around me leads me to believe it was good bit higher than what it felt like.

Anyways, thinking back all I remember is seeing a pass and almost subconsciously telling myself I had to get it. Immediately, I jumped up w/o even thinking once. I only remember two things going through my head at that moment. Being at my peak with the ball in my hands and suddenly having both feet on the ground. No inbetweens and it wasn't slow motion or any of that. Just bam-bam and I quickly turned and made a 5 foot jumper from the edge of the key. What I also recall from the second I caught the ball was a guy next to me (who was probably the best and biggest player there) saying, ""Whoa..."" (in a slightly higher pitch) with his voice kind of trailing off and after the basket immediately asking me, ""How'd you do that?"" It wasn't like some congratulatory remark or compliment, I feel like the guy was legitimately curious as to how I managed to leap that high off the ground. The only words which came out of my mouth as I kind of shrugged were, ""I got hops, man.""

At that point, I don't think I had realized what I had done, but on the other side of the court, the guy who had thrown me that pass almost nervously/laughingly mentioned to me that I got incredibly high in the air. Again, I almost didn't know what to say. I was just doing what I thought I had to do. 

Now, you guys or myself could easily discount this as an instance where I just jumped kinda high in the air no biggie, but now I truly feel it was a lot higher than I'm normally accustomed to. Like I'm physically incapable of actually getting that high in the air if I were to just attempt it again. It was probably high enough where I'd be able to do 360's if I could jump that high on command and for the record, that's something I've never even been close to being able to do.

Sometimes, I feel this world we live in and our abilities in it are only limited by what we think we know we can do. As is the purpose of this subreddit, I believe I pulled some shit straight out of the matrix. Almost like those stories you hear of a person lifting a car off of someone. The fact that I didn't question the height of the pass or whether I could or couldn't get it allowed me to jump higher than I ever had before. I only had enough time to tell myself I needed to get 'this high' in order to get the ball. Saying that, I still don't have a full explanation for what happened.

I've had this happen quite a few times in my life. I'll be doing something and it seems like I can react in splits of seconds from seemingly random events or the make time slow down. I know it may not even seem possible. For example, I'll accidentally drop something and it won't fall. It will just seem like it just stayed there and within splits of a seconds I'll just catch it. For comparison sake, you know how you accidentally touch something that is hot and your hand jerks from the heat. It doesn't feel like that. That feels a lot slower and I don't even felt like time slowed down. I've had a few friends witness me catching something that was suppose to fall. One in particular got very shaken up by it. He said what I did was impossible and he couldn't even believe he saw it. The best way I can describe the experience is when I reacted, I don't feel like I reacted. It feels more like I acted with universal truth. Sometimes, I feel guilty after it like I miss it. It's like a fleeting moment of true power. I don't get sweaty after it. My body just goes on like nothing really ever happened. No hyper sensitivity of any kind like with traumatic events. 

Did I tap into some sort of super energy? Did I bend time? Or was it just a moment of super fast reaction?

A particular favourite was the chapter about different sorts of landscapes. I remember distinctly looking all the time at a page which had five pictures which formed an ""X"", two at the top, one in the middle and two at the bottom. These five pictures featured different landscapes, tropical beach, mountains, forests etc. 

I admit I can't remember exactly what these landscapes were anymore, except for the one in the middle.

I remember it was the middle picture of the ""X"" pattern, so I closed the book, as it was very big and heavy for little me, and carried it into the kitchen to my dad.

When I opened it again, the picture was gone. The ""X"" pattern wasn't in there anymore, just four pictures forming a square, and no tropical island picture. I thought immediately I had opened the wrong page or something, so I went through the book a few times but I didn't find that particular tropical picture anywhere else in the book.

Only the one, but it's kind of a doozie. 

Back when I was about 16, I had quite an extensive collection of books (still do, actually). It occurred to me that I should label them as mine in case one got lost; at least the hardcovers, if nothing else. I bought a package of bookplates, the kind you write your name on and adhere to the inside of the cover like a sticker. Not custom printed, the kind you can buy from any bookstore. Never got around to using them. Procrastinating, you know?

Anyway, a few weeks pass and my mom winds up tossing my copy of Stephen King's ""Skeleton Crew"", that I had left on the living room coffee table. Thinking it unwanted, she'd taken it down to the laundromat in our apartment complex, where residents often leave or pick up books. I went to retrieve it, but someone had already ganked it. I was kind of bummed, since ""The Mist"" is one of my favorite novellas, but I wasn't too worried; ""Skeleton Crew"" is a popular anthology after all. A used copy shouldn't be too hard to acquire (if it had been one of my Zelazny novels, there would have been bloodshed).

Anyway, a couple days later I go over to the apartment of my buddy who lives in the same complex, to hang out for a bit. Upon opening the door, he tells me ""Hey. I found your book in the laundromat. Did you mean to throw it out?""

""My book? You mean 'Skeleton Crew' ?""

""Yeah, it was on the shelves with the copies of Awake and Watchtower. I take it you want it back?""

""Well, yeah; but how did you know it was my copy?""

""Because... your name's on it?""

He produced my book, and lo and behold, stuck on the inside of the cover was a bookplate; under ""This book is property of"", ""Taco_Belmont"" had been written in in my handwriting. I was fairly sure I'd never put it there, but I didn't mention it; merely thanked him for returning it, and assured him he could borrow it in the future. 

Went home and looked for my bookplates; took a while, as the had been relegated to the back of my closet. When I did find them... the package was unopened. Still shrink wrapped and everything. 

And before anyone asks, hell yes I kept the cursed book. ""The Mist"" is a really good story.

Let's say you're with a group of friends you've hung out with for years, only today is the first day without one friend who just moved away. Or you're eating dinner with your family for the first time after your older sister went off to college. It's a vague feeling you get that somebody is missing, and it's not a strong feeling, but it's there. 
I've had this feeling plaguing me for my WHOLE LIFE. Every single time my entire immediate family is together (parents/siblings) I have the most nagging and persistent feeling that somebody is missing, very specifically a sibling. But nobody IS missing. A while ago I became very distraught over this and I thought I was crazy, so I told my older sister. Turns out she has always felt the same, and she got really freaked out when I shared this with her. Well, I couldn't do anything, so I let it go and we didn't talk about it because, well, it didn't really matter I guess and it was just weird. But recently after a family dinner we all attended (more rare since two of us no longer live at home and my parents are divorced) my little sister came to me and expressed that she had this feeling, that somebody was missing. Well that was that for me and I immediately questioned my brother, who admitted to feeling it as well, though he definitely hasn't dwelt on it like I have. 
So basically we all share an eerie feeling that somebody is missing from our family, but there isn't. There is no one missing. Am I crazy? It feels like some It's a Wonderful Life story and there is an alternate timeline somewhere in which I have another little brother, but for some reason we have been left without him in this one.

I was elbow-deep in the sofa, and still couldn't feel anything, not the side, not the back, and not the ground, so I reached deeper.

It all started when I went to my friends house with two other friends to spend the night. We chilled, played video games, watched a movie, ect, nothing too crazy or out of the ordinary. Come next day I am back at home, late in the afternoon, when I see that someone had left me a voice message. 

Now, here comes a little context, me and another friend had a running gag that we would leave our voice message greeting (the one that says ""Im not here right now, leave a message after the beep"" ), as a greeting making it seem like we actually picked up. As is, the phone would ring and go to a voice message and it would be a pre recorded message of us saying ""Hey whats up dude!... yeah cool... right.... just kidding I am not here, leave a message after the beep."" to us, this was hilarious and it would anger lots of friends as they would constantly fall for it. now, my friends voice message said ""Hey dude whats up, can you hang out today? oh you can't? well I can't either because I'm not here so leave me a message.""

Where this fits in is the voice message I received. you see, I listen to the message someone had left on my phone and this is where I get chills. it is clearly my voice, speaking in a drunken tone saying "" and then the message went,  Hey dude whats up, can you hang out today? oh you can't? well I can't either because I'm not here so leave me a message' hahaha! ""


... silence... then,

I hear a voice, one I didn't even remotely recocnize, and deep, almost like those modified voices they use to hide peoples identities say, 

""Hmm.....that sound pretty funny man.""


then it hangs up.  

I asked my friends about this and they had no idea what I was talking about, I could and still can remember everything I did the whole night, never did I drink or smoke anything and we didn't go to sleep absurdly late. to this day this puzzles me, I'm not even sure when it was recorded, maybe it the sender had that message for a while, who knows.

The first was when I was around 7 and my sister and I were sitting in the back seat of my dads car waiting for him to pick something up.

I took the bottle caps and was sitting on my hand, holding the bottle cap, pretending like I made it disappear or something. When i brought up my hand I had 2 bottle caps in it, my sister and I were both confused.

Number two was when I lost a pair of my earphones, couldn't find them anywhere for a week. One day they miraculously appeared under my pillow, despite the fact i had changed my sheets after I lost them. Later that day I found the same pair of earphones (small paint mark on them and all) in my downstairs bathroom. I had both pairs for a few more months, then within the same hour they both broke in the exact same way.

I duplicated earphones another time and a cookie container too...

We were driving down the highway when we saw a military cargo plane (like a C-130 or something) flying toward us, but off to the side of the road. My coach, who was driving, pointed it out to us because it was flying low and, hey, planes are cool, right? 

Anyways, everyone in the van soon realized something weird was going on. Not only was the plane flying low, but it was also going really slow as though it were coming in for a landing. It even had its landing gear down. As we got closer we saw that it wasn't just going slow, but that it was hovering and rotating. Everyone was convinced that our eyes were playing tricks on us, but when we were right next to it to where we could look out our side windows of the van and see it at a 90 degree angle from where we were headed, its tail was facing us (keep in mind that when we originally saw the plane, it was flying towards us). It was at this point when it suddenly accelerated as though it was taking off from a runway.

By now, no one could deny what we just saw. My coach immediately made claims that we had just witnessed some top-secret government experiment, but that didn't make sense to me because it was in broad daylight next to a busy interstate and because I did research later and learned there aren't any military bases within a hundred miles from where we were.  Later when we got to the tournament we told the other two vans what we saw. One van saw the plane but claims it was flying normally, and the other didn't see the plane at all, which they should have considering how low it was.  So, did I see a glitch or just a top secret government project?

This first one has happened to me twice. The first time it happened was in 2003, I was walking home from school just minding my own business, shoe-gazing, cars going up and down the road, nothing unusual so far. I'm pretty sure I was the only pedestrian walking on the sidewalk. As I looked forward, just making sure I wouldn't bump against any sign posts or anything, I realized the strangest thing. I seemed to be walking behind myself. Same converse shoes with the exact same wear and tear, same jeans, same white t-shirt, same blue backpack. Even had the same haircut. And then, it got even stranger. As I stopped walking, this other ""me"" stopped as well. I took out my glasses, rubbed my eyes, put the glasses on again, and it was gone.

The second time it happened was in August 2008. Walking home again, same route. This time there were people waaaaay behind me, I just turned to them and yelled ""WHAT THE FUCK! DO YOU SEE THIS!?"", they looked confused.

Another weird thing was this one time when I looked in the mirror and the reflection there wasn't my own. A friend of mine also experienced this, so I guess it's just a weird optical illusion of some sort.

Third one. Sleeping at home, I heard a female voice whispering in my ear ""it's time to wake up"". I instantly jumped out of bed, startled. It was 4 PM and I was the only one at home.

Last one, this happened earlier today. I'm spending the weekend at my grandma's house, pretty chill place, all the neighbors know each other and it's kinda hard to go anywhere without being noticed. I was feeling kinda tired after dinner, so I decided to take a nap. I laid in bed and closed my eyes. My parents and my grandma were watching TV in the living room, which is right next door to my room. Anyway, I woke up and all the lights were out, everything was silent. My first thought was ""Oh shit, I must've slept for too long"". I reached for the light, it didn't turn on. ""The power must be out"", I said to myself, and reached for my phone. It didn't turn on either. I reached for my lighter, flicked it, and searched for the nearest clock. It was only 10:53 PM, which meant I only slept for two hours and everyone was supposed to still be awake. I got out of my room, called my family. Nobody answered. I searched the whole house and it was empty, doors locked from the inside, keys still in the locks. I remember thinking ""where is everyone? why didn't they wake me up?"". I got out of the house to go ask my neighbors if they knew where my family went. The whole street was dark. No street lights, no lights on the other houses as well. I went next door and knocked. No answer. At this point I was already freaking the fuck out. I stood outside for what seemed like 5 minutes or so, then decided to go back inside. Everything was still dark. As I opened the door, light started coming from inside. ""Power's back on"", I thought. I entered and, to my surprise, my parents and my grandma were sitting where I left them. Watching TV. My mom said ""Where'd you come from? I thought you were sleeping"". I looked at the clock, it was 10:53 PM. And thus, my biggest ""WTF"" moment was born.",,False,,t5_2tcwa,False,,,True,t3_ohfnu,http://www.reddit.com/r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix/comments/ohfnu/a_few_things_that_happened_to_me/,

A few months ago, I went with my girlfriend and her family to a zoo a little ways outside the city we live. It specializes in desert animals, so they have like mountain lions and desert reptiles and stuff like that. 

Like I mentioned, its a bit of a drive to get out there but it winds through some nice hills and canyons, and I noted this to her on the way out there. I said something along the lines of ""I don't even care how far it is to get out here because this is a fun road to drive"". And she said, ""Yeah, that's what you said last time, you almost ran us off a cliff"". 

I immediately checked my memory, and as far as I know I hadn't been to this place in years. It's the kind of place you go once and you've really seen all there is to see. So I was almost certain that I hadn't been there since I was probably like 11 or 12, and I definitely haven't been there with my girlfriend.

The rest of the way there we went back and forth, with her insisting that this wasn't our first visit and me countering that I honestly don't remember being there last summer. When we arrived, it seemed familiar, but at the same time it was like I had to try really hard to remember. It's not like when you go to a major theme park and you walk in and it kind of clicks right away. I felt like I only had a cursory memory of the place. We asked her mom and her mom's boyfriend about it, and while they confirmed that they visited the zoo last summer, they couldn't quite remember if the two of us had come along. 

As we walked around, my girlfriend would say things like, ""Don't you remember last time you almost stepped on that lizard?"", or ""No love, you got us lost the last time, it's this way to the coyotes"". I mean these were really vivid memories she had, and I could tell that she really believed them. But to me it was all new, I couldn't remember anything about the place other than the basic stuff from my one previous visit many years ago. 

I've chalked it up my girlfriend having a really vivid dream that happened so long ago she turned it into a memory. Other than that, I really can't think of anyway to explain it.

It 100% was not there the night before as I went to be last and cleaned off the table beforehand and my wife swears she didn't put it there of have anything to do with it...and I believe her.  There were no other people in the house.

That's what happened to me. It started simple. Clocks were the first thing I noticed. I caught the clock at 12:34 PM every now and then - often enough that I started to think ""again?"". Then one night, I woke in a cold sweat and grabbed my phone - 12:34 AM. Soon, I had an urge to check the time at both 12:34s every day... but surely this was just a habit.

The one day, I hit snooze on my 5:15 AM alarm, and it woke me again at 5:22 AM, just like every day. I got up. I showered, I dressed, I went downstairs. 6:22 AM. Ate breakfast, dilly-dallied, got a ride to school, chatted, sat down in class, opened my phone. 7:22 AM. Took notes, watched a slideshow, got bored - 8:22 AM. And it continued on, every hour, until I fell asleep at 10:22 PM.

*No big deal*, I tell myself. *I've just been stressed lately, and these ADHD meds are making me act weird.*

That was 2009. It never stopped. The number changes frequently -- right now I can't escape the minutes ending in 7. It's 11:27 PM right this moment, as I submit this.

Clocks were the first thing I noticed, but far from the last.

He was white, a little dirty. The gutter that he climbed out of seemed way too small for him to fit, but when i saw him climb out, it was like hopping a fence, mixed with those drills soldiers do, crawling under barbed wire.

A loud bang wakes me up. I look out the window. I see a hunter, walking towards a downed elk. I hear my dog barking outside, and he runs towards the corpse. My dad runs after, comes back with a bloody dog. I ask him ""was it much blood?"", and in that moment i realize that I just dreamt that shit.

I have one story of disappearing/reappearing objects, one account of a duplicating object, one account of appearing objects, and two accounts of things fixing themselves.  Various other things have gone missing and reappeared throughout the year, but though strange, they were explainable enough to us (me and roommates) not to mention them.

One- My roommate goes home for christmas, three hours away.  He receives an Amazon gift card, and proceeds to accidentally leave it there when he comes back.  He talks to his dad about it, confirmed that it's at home.  A few weeks later we are sitting in the living room on the floor, and the card appears sitting in the space between the two of us.

Two- I originally thought this was a case of disappearance/ reappearance.  My roommate ""loses"" his laptop power cable.  In reality, me and another roommate hid it from him in a box in the closet (we got fed up with him leaving his stuff all over the living room and started hiding the things he left out).  It's gone for several weeks.  I forget that we hid the cord.  One day he's sitting on the sofa using his laptop (using a cord he was sharing with the fourth roommate of the house since his ""disappeared"") when his laptop cord appears out of thin air and literally drops onto the cushion beside him.  (He didn't see it appear, but it made an obvious noise when it landed, and there was nowhere for it to fall from).  It baffled us all.  But it baffled me even more the other day when I found his original cord sitting in the box in the closet, right where we had left it...

Three- Nobody has bought almonds in the house (except for shelled, sprouted almonds) this year.  Yet starting around christmas, almonds in their shells have been appearing on the floor in one specific corner of the dining room.  Sometimes we will get several of them in a week, sometimes there are weeks between them showing up.  We've asked the house or whatever may be causing them to appear to keep ""dropping"" them just for kicks.  It hasn't stopped yet, and nobody in the house will admit to dropping them if it's a joke.  And they are totally edible and delicious almonds by the way- I don't let them go to waste haha

Four- The same roommate that had the appearing/duplicating power cord lost a button on his really nice pea coat.  He stopped wearing the coat for several weeks, because the coat kept falling open without that particular button.  He left the coat on the floor of his room during this time.  He went to hang up the coat a few weeks later, only to find the button reattached- nobody in the house had fixed it, or his girlfriend.  

Five- This actually occurred outside our house, but it happened to one of my best friends. (also the girlfriend of the roommate with the self-reattaching button).  She bought a used purse a year or so ago that had an inside pocket with a broken zipper.  It was broken beyond repair-  the whole ""starting"" mechanism at the end of the zipper had been torn off.  She knew it would never be functional when she bought it, and never planned on fixing it.  One day this past winter she found that the zipper had been fixed perfectly- it works fine now.  Nobody had touched the purse, and it was the same design of zipper that had been there before, just an unbroken version.",,False,,t5_2tcwa,False,,,True,t3_1d7sac,http://www.reddit.com/r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix/comments/1d7sac/my_house_this_year/,

I made a new friend recently, who we'll call J. Over the past 4-5 years, J and I have amassed tons of mutual friends, but we had never actually been introduced to each other until a few months ago. Our social circles are so intertwined that it's a wonder we hadn't met before.  I was even friends with his brother for several years, but had never crossed paths with him. Anyway, after becoming acquainted with each other, we exchanged Skype names and phone numbers. When I saw his Skype name, I was struck with a weird sense of deja vu, like I had seen it many times before (which would be unlikely, since it's a pretty unique handle). I shrugged it off until I was looking through my gmail contacts one day and noticed an email address matching J's Skype name. So bizarre! Why would I have his email address if I had never emailed him (let alone known him)? I told him about this and we shared a few laughs and conspiracy theories.

About a month later, as I'm looking through an old care package my parents sent me at the beginning of college, I found the cellphone I had used in high school. (It was the Razr flip-phone, to give you an idea of how old it is). I wanted to see if there were any good photos on the phone, so I powered it up. No good photos, but while scrolling through the contacts list, I came across an entry named J - which is weird, since I didn't have any friends in high school named J. I had a weird feeling and, just for the heck of it, decided to cross-check the number with J's in my new phone. Same number. Cue shivers up my spine.

This happened quite a few years ago, but I still have never been able to come up with any kind of explanation.

My friend and I were driving home from Corpus Christi, TX to Springfield, MO.  A good friend of mine lives in Corpus so this was a drive I had made many, many times.  It is a super simple drive, you take like two major highways.  I could probably drive it in my sleep (but I don't think that is what happened).  The drive always takes almost exactly 14 hours.   

It was late at night, but I was not tired.  I always drive overnight when taking road trips because the traffic is so much lighter, so this was a normal thing.  My friend and I were talking and listening to music while driving in Oklahoma when suddenly we realized we were no longer on I-44.  We were on a small highway in a tiny town in Oklahoma.  Everything immediately around us was closed, so we couldn't even ask someone to find out where we were.  We were pretty freaked out.  We had no idea how we had gotten off of a major highway without either of us noticing and had no idea where we were.

We drove down the road a bit and found a gas station that was open.  We went in and asked for the quickest way to get back to I-44.  The girl started giving us directions that led down a small, winding, dark highway.  I asked her about how long it would take to get back to I-44 and she said it would take about an hour.  I asked again to make sure there was no quicker way and she assured me that was the quickest way back to the highway.  I was completely stunned!  Up until that point I could *maybe* believe that we had been busy talking and I had somehow taken an exit without noticing (though this is a huge stretch for me to believe).  But I just can't wrap my mind around us taking an exit and being on a dark, winding highway for an hour without noticing.  And here is the craziest part.... We followed the girl's directions, got back on the highway and drove the rest of the way home without incident.  But we arrived home **12** hours after we left Corpus.  Remember, I have driven that route many times and it takes almost exactly 14 hours.  But this time we took a detour of an hour + and arrived home two hours early.  I have no explanation!

First, some back story. About 18 years ago my dad had to travel constantly because of work, my mom and him had been really struggling economically with the job he had in the city we lived at, so he took another job which forced him to travel to another province in my country back and forth. We couldn't just move there because my mom still had her job as an OBGYN in one of the local hospitals, but the pay was still crap and they needed my dad's income as well to fully support us. Anyhow, I was about 4 at the time, and had gotten a really bad case of pneumonia, which ended up with me hospitalized for about a month. I was very young and hadn't yet developed proper bodily defenses, so I went through a lot of complications.

My dad wanted to quit and stay with me, but if he did they wouldn't be able to pay the hospital bills and so during my stay at the hospital I didn't see him much, but he'd call a lot. 3 weeks into my hospital stay, my pneumonia worsened to the point the doctors gave my mother the 'expect the worse' talk. They were gonna prep me for surgery the next day in what basically was a 'last attempt' for me to get better. When this happened, my dad was about 400 miles away, and my mom called to explain the situation. 

My dad has never been a religious man, he and my mom had been baptized and taken to church as children but they'd never really kept on with catholic traditions when they grew up. Since he was away and couldn't come home, and seeing how most people turn to faith in moments like these, he drove to a church he'd seen when he first came into the city. It was early in the morning and it was a week day so the place was pretty much deserted, and he sat intending to pray for me, which he did for a few moments (the usual things - help my daughter, please give me a sign she's gonna get better, etc) before he thought he was being incredibly stupid. 

He decided on the spot he would drive back home, the job be damned, and basically ran out the church to his car. On his way out, he ran into a man, and he quickly apologized and kept on going. The man grabbed him by the arm and told him to wait. At this point my dad was getting frantic, he told me he was basically this close to yelling at this guy to fuck off (it's really hard for him to lose his temper), but that something about his demeanor just, calmed him down instantly. That he somehow felt safe and that things were going to be alright. He told me he doesn't remember anything particular about his appearence, it was just a middle aged man with a hat and an old coat, but that his expression was kind and he spoke softly. 

The man told my dad, ""Marcelo, don't worry. Lucia is going to be fine."" My dad basically gaped at him, for knowing his name and mine and saying that, and was frozen in place, considering he'd never seen this person before in his life (and this was another city hundred of miles away, nobody would know of our situation there). The guy smiled and walked away, but by the time my dad reacted the guy had walked around the corner and when my dad ran after him he couldn't find him anymore. He asked around the church but no one knew who he was/had never seen him. After that he called my mom to ask about me, and she told him the doctors said I wouldn't need the surgery in the end because my lungs had gotten better. After that I recovered pretty fast and was out of the hospital the next week. 

To this day my dad has no idea who/what the fuck the guy was, why or how he knew us, but he's pretty sure he'd have had killed himself driving back home like that. (Back then the roads were pretty messed up and you had to be careful driving) So he thinks somebody answered when he was praying for me.

Or tl;dr i almost die of pneumonia, my dad is away, he prays for me in a church and a stranger (angel? who knows) tells him not to worry that i'm going to be fine using our names, then disappears, and i get better

A little background: My coworker (let's call him Jon) and I have worked together for about two years now. Over these two years he has had an on again off again girlfriend/fling that constantly yanks him around. On multiple occasions I have advised him to stop talking to this chick (we will call her Lisa) altogether and they haven't been talking for 4+ months. He has found a new girl that he has been dating for a few weeks now.

Jon and I were sitting at the front counter waiting for another customer to come in. I was showing him something on my phone when I heard his go off in his pocket. I heard his text message chime then very distinctively I heard the phone say ""Text message from Lisa _____."" 

I looked at him and said that his phone had chimed and asked him when he had started talking to Lisa again. He looked at me with confusion and asked how I knew they had started speaking again. I told him that she just texted him and I had heard his phone announce it. He claims that his phone said no such thing so I told him I would text him and he could hear for himself.

I grabbed my phone and sent him a quick message but when it came through on his phone it only played the chime. I was shocked, I had distinctly heard her name from his phone even though it was inside his pocket. He thought I was crazy so I proposed we wait for her to text him back so he could hear it for himself. 

When the text message from Lisa came through his phone the second time, only the chime sounded. There was no ""Text message from Lisa ______."" this time! I even went into his settings to see if there was some sort of button to push that could make his phone do that but I found nothing of the sort.

I didn't see the phone so I couldn't have seen that it was his ex texting him, and since he hadn't been talking to her for months it was highly unlikely that I just guessed the message correctly.

I've never posted here before but I think this may be a glitch.

It started two weeks ago when I was driving to my friend's house which is typically an 18 minute commute. I left my house at 10:00 am and expected to arrive at about 10:20 or so. However, there was little to no traffic and I figured I'd probably get there even earlier. I didn't bother checking my car's clock again until I pulled into the driveway and the dash displayed the time as 10:52. I was baffled and trying unsuccessfully to figure out how I'd managed to make the commute last over half an hour longer than it should have been. I decided not to think too much about it since it took me a little under 20 minutes to return home, as usual.

I'm going on vacation this weekend so I started my laundry a few days ago. I'd already washed a load and they needed to be put in the dryer. I put the dryer on the gentle cycle and keyed in my other preferences and was rewarded with an estimated time of 51 minutes. Fair enough. I pressed ""start"" and headed upstairs to read to fill the time. My dryer is set to alarm once it's done so I took the liberty of noting the time so that I'd know when to head back downstairs- just in case I missed the alarm. It was 5:33 so my clothes would be ready at about 6:24.  I set the kettle on before locating my book. A few minutes later, I was sitting on my couch, novel and tea in hand. I only got through a few pages before the alarm sounded. I went downstairs expecting the clothes to be sopping wet (faulty alarm, perhaps) yet they were perfectly dry, despite the size of the load. It was 6:00.

My grass needed cut this morning and I always take the back. It usually takes me about 35 minutes to mow yet today, for whatever reason, it only took 17. I wasn't moving any faster yet once I came back inside, on 17 minutes had passed. There were other examples but these were the only ones that I've remembered to actually write down.

I used to hang out with a couple of guys from this game store I would go and stand around and loiter. They were all employees there, I was a wannabe. 17 years old, nothing better to do, just wanted to make friends and be around games.  

After a couple of weeks of getting to know them more than just 'game store guys'. They asked if I wanted to come hang out sometime and play DnD. Sure. I had never played, but wanted to hang out.  

I brought a friend of mine along with me, so it would be a bit more social of two groups combining.  

Here we are, my friend and I. 2 Guys from the game store, and one of their friends. As well as a brother of one of the 'game store guys'. 

5 people total involved here.  

I am not one to get into much trouble legally, or go out to do anything out of the ordinary. But this night felt different. They were students at a college, and I was just a 17 year old nerdy high-schooler. They decided after a bit of DnD to go climb the dorm ladders outside and go to the roof of the building that we were hanging at.  

Here I am, climbing this building, thinking about how much trouble we could get into, and how did I end up with a group of older people in the middle of the night climbing a building. I rarely did anything out of the ordinary.  

So we get to the top, and then these guys pull out weed. I had never smoked, or personally seen it in person my entire life. They asked me to join, and I did not partake. After a couple minutes of talking and joking, they said, ""well let's light up."" Not one person, out of 5 people, had a lighter. At this point, we had been just hanging around for about 15 minutes on the roof, and a few of us were getting worried that we'd be caught on the roof of the school building.  
  
Everyone decided to climb back down, we'd stop and grab a lighter at the dorm, we'd all go to the local Park, we'd park in the back and turn the car lights off. Well, I once again, did not want to be apart of this. I told them I'd drop them off, and just text me to come back when they were finished. I did not feel right, something felt off.  

I dropped the other 4 guys off, and decided to go make a few blocks, and just listen to music. Driving off, I looked in the rear-view mirror and watched them all hike off into the woods in the dark. A lighter lighting up in the distance.  
 
After about 30 minutes, I figured they'd have to be finished by now. I try to text 2 of them. No reply. I tried calling. No reply. Wow. How do they plan on getting back home?  
  
I start driving back, and decided I'd just park and wait for them to come back. About 2 miles from the Park, I see a couple of people running on the side of the road. As I get closer, I notice, it's 2 of them! My friend that came with me, and one of the original guys from the game store. 

""What are you guys doing?"" As I pull up next to them. ""Dude! Dude!"" They are freaking out, and jump into the back of my car.  

""The cops came! They found us and said they saw us pull in then saw a car leave! It's after hours at the Park, we can't be there."" The game store guy is breathing heavy... ""They took my brother, he was holding the pipe, and they got him, we ran away!""   

In their intoxicated state, they panicked and ran for it. Luckily I found them, but what about the other two guys. We know the fate of his brother. Busted. The other game store guy? Lost but not found. 
  
""Back to the dorm."" he says. Fast forward. Back at the dorm, he is losing it, panicking. He decides it's best to call their mom and explain everything. ""Mom they took him. We were smoking at the park, it's my fault.""  
 
All I could think about was that weird feeling I had as I drove off, knowing something wasn't right before all this happened.  
  
The conversation goes south, and he starts arguing with her, and hangs up. He explains she's on her way to the police station, he has to meet her there, this and that. Tells my friend and I to just go home, he'll see us at the game store in a couple of days.   
  
My friend and I decide to go and sit in the parking lot at a grocery store to pass the time and find out the final solution to everything, and what in the hell happened to the other guy who was lost but not found. He was not picking up his phone.  
  
At the grocery store, it's been about an hour since all the events of the night, and we agree to go inside and get food. On our way in, we see a man, in his mid 30s. Sitting on a bench outside the front door.   
  
He casually says 'You guys had a crazy night.' Shocked for a second, we agreed. 'Yeah it's been a bit crazy.'   

He sits back, and makes eye contact with us both. ""I too have had a crazy night. I'm lost and finally going home tonight.""  
  
Not sure what he was on about, we said good luck with everything. Then suddenly he stands up. He's covered in tattoos from arm to shoulder. He has a dirty blue jean jacket on, his boots are worn. He looks like a 90s grudge guy who never grew out of it.  
  
""Don't mistake bad luck for what's supposed to happen."" He tells us.  
Then as he speaks these words, a girl, with roughly similar style and appearance walks up and sits on the bench. ""Who are your new friends?"" She ask the man.  
  
He doesn't answer here, and it's quiet for a few seconds. An awkward silence happens. Suddenly, a cop is walking in our direction from the parking lot. My mind starts racing. Here I am, a young kid in the middle of the night, standing in front of a grocery store near 2 dirty looking grunge people, like some sort of a drug deal.  

The cop walks  by, makes eye contact with only me and my friend. Never once looks at the two people on the bench.  
  
The cop walks on into the store. ""Don't worry, he isn't looking for you two. He's just doing his rounds. Don't worry about your friend either, his mom will get him out tonight, he'll be okay. Your other friend, I know he made his way home."" 

""What?"" I suddenly ask. ""What are you talking about?"" How did he have this detailed of information, considering we made no mention of any of this. ""Don't worry."" He says, ""Anyways, we have to go home now. It's finally our turn. We've taken care of you all."" Just a odd collection of words he puts together. My friend and I stand there, as the 'couple' it appears walks off to the other end of the building and parking lot... towards.. nothing. There were no parked cars. No busses. no taxis. Nothing. They just walked off in to the distance. 

Shocked by everything, we finally get food and go sit back in the car. 15 minutes later, a phone call. It's the game store guy, ""My brother is out, everything is okay. My mom pulled strings or something, they just decided to let him okay. They are letting the charge go. Been a crazy night, huh? It's like someone was taking care of us. Anyways, I'll see you guys.""  
  
My friend, ""Wow, what just happened, how did that guy know everything would work out?""  
  
We sat there, discussing life and how everything went down that night for another 10 minutes or so.. We drove 25 minutes home, sitting silently, both trying to interrupt the night in our heads.  
  
The other guy.. still no word from him. A day goes by. Nothing. A week goes by nothing. A month goes by. The game store guy tells me that the other guy stopped showing up to work. He never called in or anything. A year goes by. No one has heard from this guy.  

Suddenly a bout a year and a half later, back when MySpace was the big thing. I get a friend request... from the guy we lost. ""Didn't I already have him as a friend."" I try to search for him. Couldn't find that I had him. I casually accepted his friend request. ""Hey man, you have a lot of explaining.."" I send a message. He replays ""What do you mean?""  

I bring up the whole ordeal, and apparently he claims none of that happened, he says he put in his two weeks notice and moved out of state to go to school. He says that night that everything happened he was at the dorm alone. But everyone else that was there that night specifically remembers him riding in the car with us and walking into the woods with us.

On the brick base of said fence sat a man, that I could only see from behind. It was a sunny midday and he was wearing office clothes [shirt and dark trousers]. What seemed odd was that first of all he was sitting next to the bins and he seemed in obvious distress. Sort of rubbing his head, looking as if in pain. Then suddenly he slumped sideways and stopped moving. 

I kept watching him but he just didn't move and TBH he looked dead to me. Even though I could only see his back, it was the way he was slumped and whilst he could have just have fainted, my gut feeling told me that he was dead. Illogical but that is how I felt. He was sort of half on the floor, half on the base, head hanging strangely. Very hard to describe but the whole scene screamed 'dead', not fainted. Honestly I would not have worried so much otherwise, maybe gone down slowly to ask if he needed water maybe.

However I waited a little longer, not knowing what to do. It was a strange situation. He was definitively not a tramp, his clothes looked expensive; but he didn't move at all.

I came to the conclusion that he may have felt bad, sat down and then died of a heart attack or something. I know it is an extreme thought but everything about him felt 'strange' sort of 'out of place'.

So thinking back and forth, I decided to go out and see and check him out to see if he needed an ambulance. To get out of the house and down the stairs and around the small corner would have taken me no more than 6-7 seconds. I was basically running.

Yet when I got there he was gone. From being 'unconscious/dead' to having got up and run away in 6 seconds makes no sense. It would have taken him that long just to get back on his feet. He did not act or joke around as not only was he alone but where he was sitting nobody would have seen him anyway and the way he was so distressed before slumping was real. I thought he may have had a heart attack or a stroke.

Also from where I was standing, he could not have gone anywhere far without me seeing him [unless he hid behind a car but I actually checked the ones nearby, still worried about him! But then why would he hide, he didn't even know I had watched him???]. Even if he got up and gone into another house, it would have taken him longer than me going downstairs as the next door was quite far away [all withing sight] and again, he did not know I was coming down or that he was watched.

It seems minor but it has stayed with me forever since. The whole situation felt so eerie and weird. I had seen people collapsing before but this was really strange. It certainly wasn't a ghost as he was as solid as any normal person and nothing else screamed 'ghost' on that sunny day.

Maybe I say a scene from an alternative dimension, maybe he had died  in some other reality? Everything about it seemed 'not quite right'.

Ever since I was very young (around 10 or so) me and my best friend have used a single trail through a small patch of woods, near his house, as a shortcut to a park.  We called it 'The Lost Woods', for no real reason other than the fact that we are both huge fans of The Legend of Zelda.

A few years ago, he claimed he saw something like a 'fairy'(about the size of your average moth) float near his face while crossing through those woods.  I told him that he may have seen something abnormal, but you can never claim you saw a fairy with 100% certainty, you know?

Anyway, despite how sure he was of what he saw, I never thought much of it, other than ""well that's kinda interesting.""

Fast forward a few years.  That friend has moved away, out of state.  I decide to go for a walk, and for old time's sake, I take that trail... or so, I intend to.  However, when I come to where the entrance to the trail used to be, there is nothing.  I think ""well, maybe it grew in?"" though it seemed very unlikely as the trail was very old, well beaten, and *I had been there less than a year prior.*

I decide 'fuck it, i'll cut through the brush and get to it that way.' Mind you, this isn't a very large stretch of forest, maybe a few hundred feet across... so there's no way I could really just 'lose it'. However, upon bush-whacking my way to where the trail used to be, I realize that the place I used to know was completely gone.

Not in the way that it was grown over, or anything.  It was just... a completely different place.  The creek that followed the side of the trail was completely gone, with no evidence that it, or the trail, ever existed.  What used to be dense, thick woods was now wide open space with few trees.  In the middle of it all was an old truck that looked like it had been rotting there for 50 years.  There was some kind of utility pipe sticking out of the ground, which also looked a few decades old. Nor the truck, or pipe were ever there before. Where there used to be hills, covered in trees and brush, were now flat land covered in nothing but dead leaves.

I know this might seem silly, like the forest took back the trail or something like that... but when you grow up in a place, see it all the time, you know it like the back of your hand.  It's very difficult to explain the profound difference I felt through text, but I know that it wasn't normal.  The area I used to know was very distinct and obvious. I can still remember the specific changes in terrain along the trail.

The area there now... is a completely different place, devoid of any similarity other than the fact that it is still a forest.  I even investigated all the surrounding woods (which isn't much, seeing as this is inside of a neighborhood after all) to make sure I wasn't just missing it, but there was no trace of it at all, anywhere.

My idea was that it could be sharpened. So I set up a pseudo scientific experiment. 

I reasoned that if one was to improve their ability, one would first have to believe that it is real. So I took this as my given, and then tried to figure out how I could train up the skill in order to prove the idea. To train, I spent my idol thoughts for a while thinking about the future. Trying to predict what I would see when I opened the door to my house, stuff like that. IMHO it works best to visualize things you have a familiarity with, and try to take in all the information at your disposal. For example, I'd try to predict where I would find my roommate when I got home. Knowing his work schedule and habits I'd predict that he would be playing video games.  Stuff like that. 

After a while I noticed myself doing small things that kinda seemed like positive results. For example, I would go to find a video in the back room of the rental place I worked, and would find my eyes darting directly to the location of the video. Very far from concrete evidence, and certainly subject to confirmation bias, but still. It was happening with a bit more regularity that would seem warranted. A cynic would argue that I simply learned how to find the video faster, and I would not argue against that. In fact, I'd say that processing the information at your disposal in required. 

Anyways, later I had a flash of insight where I was thinking of my walk home from school, and in my mind's eye, I saw a small rubber ball. Later I found that ball. It was one of those bouncy balls you can get from those candy machines for a quarter. Maybe I saw it the previous day and subconsciously recalled that, sure. But it seemed pretty amazing to me. What struck me was the way the idea came to me.  It wasn't a rational thought.  It didn't follow any sort of progression.  I just saw the ball in my mind and then found it. 

Flash forward a few weeks and I have this intense dream. I'm on the beach. It's dark. Twilight hours I think, maybe early morning, but to my mind right now it feels like it was recently dark. The sky is especially dark because of the huge storm clouds over head. Ahead of me is a sail boat that is run aground. It's on its side, half buried in the sand, several paces from the shoreline. Out to sea is a funnel cloud, but not like a tornado. Much bigger. It takes up almost the entire view. The feeling in the air is dread.

It's a hurricane. My body knows it. In my mind, within the dream, I see a map of the Atlantic ocean. And on that map spanning the distance between South America and Africa is the hurricane before me. 

I wake up in a cold sweat, shaken up by this dream. It takes me a while to get back to sleep as I process what happened. 

The next morning I tell my roommate about this insanely vivid dream. Specifically I tell him about the hurricane being off the coast of Brazil. Well about a week later a hurricane hit's Brazil. They called it a tropical storm at first because hurricane strength winds had never hit the South America before. It hit the god damn exact spot I had dreamt about. I had to confirm with my roommate that I had told him the location information. I could barely believe it. I was pretty shaken up about the whole thing. 

The feeling of dread from the beach has never really left me. I'm kind of afraid to continue the experiments, if you can call them that. Going to a beach even now gives me chills. 

Anyways. That's my story. Here's a news story about the hurricane if you're interested.

We stopped to wait at a pedestrian crossing for the lights to change — the standard British ‘pelican crossing’, a plain red silhouette of a man standing still.

As usual when waiting for the lights to change, we all watched them impatiently. Eventually they changed, to the normal British green man mid-stride, and we started crossing. As we walked, we kept an eye on the lights to make sure we had time to make it across comfortably.

About half way across the road, there was — quite literally — a ripple in reality, a brief flash of disturbance, and suddenly the lights had changed again… but not back to red.

The plain green guy was now wearing wide-bottomed flares and glasses, had long, flowing hair cascading out behind him, and had a line of stars from in front of his forehead that trailed over his head and down his back, each one slightly bigger than the previous, like some kind of cloak. We all stopped dead and exchanged stunned looks. One of us (I forget which) said “Did you…?”; the other two both replied “Yes” before he could finish the sentence.

Then we remembered the traffic and hurried across the road, and waited nervously for the lights to go red again. Sure enough, on both sides of the road, the red guy had changed too. He was now carrying a briefcase, smoking a pipe (with wisps of smoke rising), wearing a little homburg hat, and he had big brogues on his feet.

We watched at the lights cycle for ten minutes or so, but eventually continued on, feeling really freaked.

A couple of days later, I was talking about it with a group of friends. To my amazement, one of the girls said “Oh yeah, I heard about that.” I muttered something incredulous, and she told me that she’d seen an article in the press talking about how the council had recently changed the lights on that pedestrian crossing.

Apparently it was some sort of tribute about the death of a singer who had been famous in the sixties, and who had lived in that street. She was certain that the three of us there had just not noticed the difference in the lights until we were half-way across the road.

I was far from convinced — the council changing the plates over the lights made sense, but not in less than the blink of an eye. Anyway, L. promised to bring me the article to have a look at our next gathering a couple of weeks later.

A few days later, I went back to Camden to look at the changed lights more closely. The construction was standard — they were just black-painted glass, the top section red glass and the bottom section green, with the shapes of the men etched out of the paint, and white bulbs behind.

The figures were based on the original templates of the walk/go men, but with extra details etched out of the black paint to provide the outfits. The glass was bolted in, and took up the entire casing in front of the light bulbs. There was no possible mechanism by which they could have slid down in front of the other plates, or anything of that sort.

Just in case, I hung around at a cafe across the road for about an hour, watching the lights, but they stayed changed. A week after that, I went back again for another look, to get a sketch of the altered designs. I was disappointed to find that the lights were back to being perfectly normal.

It was our regular gathering a couple of days later, and I was quite keen to see the article that L. had mentioned. When I asked her if she had brought it in however, she looked at me blankly. She clearly didn’t have the slightest idea what I was talking about.

She didn’t remember me mentioning traffic lights, Camden, or anything else, and neither did any of the others there. She had never heard anything about the council changing some pedestrian crossing lights, or even of a sixties singer dying recently. In fact, none of them remembered me saying anything much at our previous gathering. When I re-told the story, everyone seemed quite spooked by it all.
I called D. and S. immediately afterwards, and yes, they still remembered it clearly. D. seemed amused by it all; S. was just terrified.

The only explanation I have that can even begin to stand up to Occam is that we briefly swapped into a closely-aligned parallel dimension. If the other two hadn’t been there, I doubt I’d trust my own memory of the event, it was so surreal. But as it happens, I have since had a couple of other experiences that also look a little like some minor dimensional swapping, although they’re less dramatic *wry grin*.",,False,,t5_2tcwa,False,,,True,t3_ot5nl,http://www.reddit.com/r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix/comments/ot5nl/dimension_swap/,

Luckily for me a lot of them involved someone being around, or I'd think I'm just plain titsbonkers.

I posted a few in the starting thread that made this subreddit, so here are two more, slightly more detailed ones.

Once, at my workplace (theatre) I was alone save for the events manager and some construction crew working to fix a leak that had collapsed a segment of our wooden stage. Seeing as how all the crew was up on the roof aside from the two of us, it is impossible for what happened to have happened. I was up in the catwalk, or the metal grid above the audience re-focusing a few lights. Considering the darkness up there, you have to be pretty careful where you walk. You also don't want anything on you that can fall and potentially injure someone below... so all I had with me was a flashlight and a wrench. Both were tied to me, so that if dropped they'd just swing from my belt.

As I'm carefully focusing one particularly rude instrument, I hear a holler from below of ""heads up."" This usually means that something has been spotted falling, so everyone knows to get the hell out of the way. I look down, because there's not a damn way anyone can be above me, since I'm at the highest point save for the stage. Nobody there. Events lady is sitting quietly reading. I start to yell down to her when I get clocked in the head by a very large screw out of fucking nowhere. After a few dizzying moments of *having just been hit by a damn screw* I climb back downstairs. Now, this requires me to walk over to a door, climb a ladder, go into a room, down a ladder, into a LOCKED room and outside. From there I have to take stairs to another locked door to get into the theatre proper. Only I have the key on me.

No construction crew were above that portion of the roof at the time. When I handed her the screw, she had no idea where it could have come from. I asked the foreman of the construction crew, who seemed utterly baffled because it was from a piece of equipment that was outside-- in the parking lot. The construction crew was wholly male, and the person that yelled was female. Nobody had a clue how that happened, but they eyed me as if I had stolen it. 

Second story, less confusing and more terrifying to me:

I was walking home, alone, very late. My area at the time wasn't very safe, but it was what I could afford with my unemployed ex-boyfriend. As I came to my home's street, I heard a loud thud. Usually this meant something rather bad, so I started jogging to the house. It was still a good three blocks away. The thud happens again, but it feels like it is in my damn head. I have a moment of ""wtf seizure?!"" and run home. My head started to hurt after the second thud. I'm panicked-- not for myself, but because I feel like something is extremely wrong. I shakily open my door and turn on all the lights. As expected, my house was fine... but my dog had apparently fallen into a mess on the floor, shaking in a seizure brought on by god knows what. My ex was frantically telling me how he fell, twice, thudding loudly on the floor with his head. He turned out to be alright (the landlord had laid out mouse poison without us knowing. Dog got into it, but recovered.)
Not sure how I managed to mindmeld with a dog, but hey. I managed to stabilize him, so maybe it saved his life.

Just a small ""glitch"" for me. This was about 6 years ago, I was 17 years old and my best friend was house-sitting for a friend of her family's and invited me to come along with her so she didn't have to spend the night alone in a strange empty house. We played with the family's dog, and shared literally 1 glass of the family's Limoncello (we weren't big into partying at that age and thought it would be cool, but newsflash, Limoncello does not make you drunk.)

That night before falling asleep on the family's couch, I called my mom to say goodnight and let her know we were locked into the house safely. I distinctly remember calling her and walking around the house as we talked, telling her about my night all with my friend chiming in to tell my mom funny things that we did. After hanging up, I sank into the couch and fell asleep.

In the middle of the night, probably 4 a.m. or so, I'm woken up by a call from my mother, a nervous wreck saying that I hadn't called! I insisted that I had and my best friend woke up to me slightly arguing with my mom and she agreed that I had certainly called. Assuming that she must have been half asleep when I called and had forgot the conversation, we all went back to sleep.

The next morning, I re-capped with my friend and we agreed that I certainly had made the call. When I got home that afternoon my mom again insisted that I'd never made the initial call, so we agreed to both check our phones. There was no record of the call on either of our phones. I have no idea how my friend and I could have had a group hallucination of a pretty mundane 20 minute phone call with my mom. I'm so sure that I called and remember speaking with my mom.

First thing happened when i was about 9. I lived in a two story house. My room was upstairs. I was up in my room doing homework and i needed help with something. So i go downstairs to ask my mom and she isn't home. I thought maybe she had gone to the store or something but i thought it was strange she didnt tell me she was leaving. So i go back upstairs and sit down, and then all of a sudden i hear the tv on downstairs. So i go down and she is sitting on the couch watching tv. I asked her where she went and she just looked at me very confused. I explained what happened and she swore to me that she had been sitting there for at least an hour. I have no idea what happened. 

Second story probably has some kind of reasonable explanation but, it still weirds me out. 

So i had fallen asleep on the floor. Next to me was a dresser and on the dresser was my moms jewelry. She would keep her jewelry in a large tin tray. 

So im sleeping, and i hear a voice in my dream say ""Prepare for a loud sound"" and then immediately after that, my moms cat knocked the tin tray off the dresser and it landed right next to my head with a loud crash. The voice was a female voice and it sounded almost like an automated message machine. I pretty much just thought it was a weird dream...untill it happened again. 

A few years later. I was sleeping (in a bed this time) and i have a dream of this same voice, except this time she says ""prepare for an awkward moment"". A few seconds later i wake up, and I'm on the phone with my dad. Apparently he had called me, and i answered the phone in my sleep and was just mumbling too him incoherently. I snap out of it and my dad is saying ""what are you saying?"" very confused. I tell him ""sorry i just woke up, i dont know how i got on the phone"". I didn't tell him about the dream thing.

I was running late to my language class, and decided to take the elevator instead of the staircase. I get to the building, and take the elevator to the seventh floor, but I couldn't see anyone through the window of the door from where I was standing. This didn't weird me out too much because sometimes we had class on the third floor. So I took the elevator down to the third floor, but that classroom was also empty. At this point I was wondering if my class had been cancelled, so i went down to the office on the first floor. I asked the office staff about it, and they told me that it was on the seventh floor.

So back to the elevator I went, to the seventh floor. From the elevator, I could only see half of the classroom through the window on the door, but this time I went and had a proper look. The door was locked, the lights were off, and there was nothing and no one in the room, or on the entire floor. I checked the floor number, and it was definitely the seventh floor. So I went back down, checking the fifth (on a faint suspicion that there might've been another classroom there) and third floor just in case, and told the office lady my story. She then called my teacher, who answered and said she was on the seventh floor with the two other students.

I took the stairs to the seventh floor, and found all of the lights in the corridor and classroom on. I walked up to the window, and my teacher and the other students were inside, books all spread out, writing on the board, and the air-conditioning going strong. I went in, apologised for being late, and asked if they had been there the whole time. They said they had. One of the students even said they'd even texted me and told me that class was on the seventh floor. I didn't hear my phone buzz, but I did get the message.

For a while I was convinced they had hidden from me somehow to trick me. Being a small class, of three people and a teacher to be exact, we occasionally did muck around, but the teacher that day was the really strict one, so she wouldn't have allowed anything like that. Plus, I know those other students really well, and they can never keep a straight face when lying. The other thing that was strange was that there were also people in the room next door, where the first two times there was no one at all.

I have no explanation for it and have seldomly brought it up to friends or family for fear or them thinking I'm a crazy. 
My parents still live in the same house I grew up in. It's a small neighborhood surrounded by woods and dense shrubbery. As a child, all of the neighborhood kids would get together and play hide and seek or tag in the trees. One summer afternoon (I was about 10 or 11), we began a game in the woods and everyone scattered in different directions. There were about 12 kids playing, ranging from 9 to 14 in age. We were playing on a sprawl of about 5 acres so there were plenty of places to hide. I walked along the fence line and decided to crawl in between some shrubs so I would have my back to the fence. That way no one could sneak up behind me and I could see an open clearing in front of me pretty well. I even remember bringing a fruit by the foot to snack on while I was waiting everyone out. 
I stayed hidden for probably twenty or so minutes when I heard some rustling leaves and heavy footsteps. I peered over the top of the bushes and saw someone I didnt recognize about 20 yards away in the open spot in the forest. It definitely was not any of the kids involved in the game. In my kid mind this person looked pretty old or at least ""grown up"" with red short hair and a white tshirt on walking across the clearing. I thought for some reason I was in trouble so I didnt dare call out to this person. That was the only way to rationalize the knot I got in my stomach while watching her. 
Right as this person was nearing the edge of the clearing on the opposite side and about to disappear into the thick brush, she seemed to stumble, grab her ankle or maybe foot in pain, and crouch down out of my line of sight. The weeds and brush were just high enough to envelope her completely. I started to panick so I jumped from my hiding spot and darted over to this injured person. As stupid as it seemed, I was always brought up to help someone when they were in distress. But when I got there, she was gone. I stood exactly where she crouched down, I didn't even take my eyes off of the spot. Somehow, I rationalized to myself that she ran off and just didn't see her or maybe I had dozed off in the shade of my hiding place and dreamed it. I brushed it off and honestly never thought twice about what had happened until about 5 years ago. 
I was 19 and home for the summer from my first year of uni. While my parents were at work I decided to lounge around and sit out on the deck. As I opened the door, our old cat, Nala, darted out the back door and straight into the woods by the house. I didnt even put shoes on because I was so scared of her getting lost, I just took off. I almost caught her but realized that me unintentionally charging her while trying to catch her was only driving her farther into the trees. I stopped and calmly walked behind her by about 15 feet, trying to softly call to her. But she was out of the house, old and scared so she panicked and darted away. That's when it happened. With my bare foot, I stepped on an old rusty piece of barb wire strewn across the path. I crumbled and hit the ground. I can't remember yelling out profanities but I'm sure I did. I was bleeding pretty badly so I took off my shirt to wrap around my foot as a make shift shoe/bandaid. Thankfully my parents house is far enough in the woods that didnt have to worry about someone spotting a girl in only a bra walking around. 
I made it back to the house and that's when it all came flooding back to me like deja vu(sp)?. The bloody white shirt wrapped around my foot and my freshly dyed red hair(as a rebellious statement I guess) and, upon an investigation of my positioning from when I was ten and from where I fell, I confirmed that I had stepped on the barb wire at the exact same place I had seen the mysterious person in the woods crouch down. I had seen myself when I was 10 as a 19 year old. 
Thanks to all that read this, I'm not the best story teller but I think this went okay. Has anyone else experienced anything similiar?

We had only had a few beers each, and it had just gotten dark when we realized that we were out of beer, so we decided to all jump in my car and go to the liquor store.  

The liquor store was about a mile away, to get there you take a right out of the driveway, go about a half mile and take a left at the 4 way stop, and the store is another half mile up on the right.  Simple enough, but the directions are the important thing to keep in mind to understand what happened.

So the 4 of us walk outside to my car, the night was normal except for a weirdly thick fog that I remember my brother remarking on, cliche I know but this may be relevant.  Anyways we take a right out of the driveway, drive to the 4 way stop sign and take a left, after about 100 feet I realize I forgot my wallet back at the house and tell everyone we have to go back, so I take a left into the next drive way I see to turn around, when all of the sudden we all realize that we're back at the house!  We sit there speechless for a minute or so, I think I stupidly said something like ""Oh, we're already back at the house"", but I immediately realized how apparently impossible that was, and yet we were in fact back at home where were just left from not 2 minutes ago!

So we sat there for a while going over exactly every move we had just made, everyone remembered the same thing, we left the house drove down the road, made a left then a left into the first driveway and BAM, we're back where we started.  So now we're all completely freaked out, and all I could think to do was run into the house(to make sure it was our house and not just an identical one), it was our house just as we had left it, and I grabbed my wallet and we drove the same route again and this time made it to the liquor store without warping or experiencing anymore temporal anomolies lol.

To this day everyone still recalls the events exactly how we remembered it that night, and we've never been able to come up with an explanation that didn't sound crazy.",,False,,t5_2tcwa,False,,,True,t3_1gj97d,http://www.reddit.com/r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix/comments/1gj97d/driving_glitch_did_we_teleport/,

I realize that we aren't supposed to post things that happened as a kid but this happened in front of both of my parents. I remember this very clearly and I'm 100% convinced that this wasn't a dream or my 9 year old mind playing tricks on me. 


So, The SNES had been out for less than a week and my parents knew how much I wanted one but they were waiting til Christmas to buy it for me. The day this happened I was playing in the yard when my dad pulled into the driveway. He had gone to Blockbuster and rented one for me. This was amazing by itself since BB only had 2 or 3 that they rented out and it was so soon after release. Needless to say I was as happy as a 9 year old can get while my dad was hooking it up to the tv. As soon as it was ready to go, I popped in Super Mario World and powered it up. My parents both see how happy I am and are in the living room to share the moment of me playing an SNES for the very first time. This is where thing get weird. 


When the game starts, I load up the save data and start playing. Then I notice something. The layout of the map looks kinda like the Forrest of Illusions area but it isn't. The layout of the map is all wrong. The levels are laid out in the pattern of the fire flower. You know, in the same way that the Star Road map is laid out in the pattern of a star. There were maybe 9 or 10 levels on the map with no ghost houses or castles and no way to exit out of the area. Also the levels were out of order. None of them were levels that should have been in the Forrest of Illusions. I distinctly remember that one of the levels was that one from the special area where you had to use the P balloon to float across the whole level or you would fall to your death. Being the first time I had ever played SMW, or even an SNES I didn't see anything wrong with this and didn't think anything of it. Even my dad said, ""Oh thats cool. The map looks like the flower."" After playing for a little while I said, ""Ok, I'll come back to this later. I wanna play F-Zero now."" So I turned off the power, put in F-Zero and played that for a little while. When I got tired of that, I went back to playing SMW. I turned it on and then said, ""Where'd the flower area go?"" The game had gone back to how it should look, with (what I now know) are the correct map layouts and level order. It turns out that the guy who had it before me didn't even get anywhere close to unlocking the Forrest of Illusions area, and hadn't unlocked any part of Star Road. Every time I turned it back on after that, it loaded up everything like it should.


To this day I have never seen any homebrew maps, rom hacks, or unused game data that look anything like what I saw that day. Every time I think about this I tell myself that the guy who had it before me screwed with the rom file. But deep down in the back of my mind, I find it extremely unbelievable that someone in a little podunk South Carolina hick town with a population of ~2500 would have had the means, knowledge of SNES rom hacking, or time to pull off something like that. Like I said, the SNES had been out for less than a week at that point.

My dad is at work, and my mom was out running errands, while I was at home, and I had a friend over (after school).

While alone, I get the idea that I want to show my friend some of my father's guns (We had just gotten a new SKS, which was really cool looking). So we go over into my dad's office where they are kept and start handling them

That's when the house phone rang, and I answered, it was my mom calling from a payphone. She had a clear nervous tone, and was telling me that we should stay away from anything ""dangerous"" like the guns (which she specifically mentioned), and then hung up.

I have always been a responsible person even as a kid, I never got into trouble when left alone, and even with the guns I knew the ammo was always stored separately and had no intention of taking it out. I also have never received any calls like this before, of her checking up at an odd time like this, especially by payphone. 

I went on the remainder of my childhood thinking the house was rigged with cameras or microphones. And believe me, I looked, and I looked well. I knew more about bugging technology before I was 12 than a spy shop owner. I built a radio receiver looking for radio emissions typical for a bug or wireless camera (schematic I read out of a spy book). Its worth noting that we weren't a terribly wealthy family so there is no way we would have been able to afford a sophisticated security/spy system anyway. Later in life I asked about it, she seemed to barely remember but she is a firm believer in the ""mother's intuition"" concept.

A scientist by both nature and trade, I hate to accept it, but FUCK i cannot explain what the hell happened that day.

**TL;DR: Somehow, my mom knew exactly when I was doing something dangerous, and called me from a payphone to tell me to stop doing that specific thing, leading to a mildly paranoid childhood suspecting secret cameras**

Many of them so common, that for a while I thought I was insane until I had a group of friends who told me they experienced strange things too. We had several common experiences (that we only found out about later and/or because someone asked, ""did you see/hear/feel that?"").

This night happened when I was 19 or so.

I was at Kore's house. She's a tall confident girl, highly spiritual, and definitely a believer in the unknown with enough sanity to test/disprove any ""odd coincidences"" in a smart way. A lot of strange activity happens in her home, and she'd experienced it since childhood of living there (though as a child, it was terrifying but she's not afraid anymore, but the reasons why are her story, not mine, should she choose to share).

We had a fun day together and were laying side by side on her bed in the pitch black darkness of a desert night in no-man's land (the town we live in has little/no public lighting, so when the lights are out in your home, everything is dark). We were watching sets of two (each) floating orbs wander the room, like the eyes of some kind of animals crawling on the ceiling and walls. There were a few dozen of them, but it wasn't unusual for us to see that sort of phenomenon.

I heard a weird noise, like a fist hitting the wall to my right, on the wall closer to her. So I sat up and looked. A pair of orbs grew, and a twisted smile just below it. There is nothing in this world as terrifying as what I saw, the face was some kind of devil or demon. I fell back against the bed and grabbed her left arm tightly, pushing my face into her side and whimpered. I said something, but I was stuttering and couldn't finish my sentence. I was trying to tell her about it, but all I could say was something like, ""its smiling at me"".

She saw it too, I could tell when her whole body tensed up. At that moment, everything seemed to be a blur. Either I was moving quickly, or the room around us was moving. She (uncertain of the origin of that vision) decided to treat it like a demon in her spirituality and claimed domain over the room, and demanded it leave. I felt something grab me, and I was shaking and overcome with spasms. I let go of her arm as she got up and something turned my body around in the bed, so instead of my head near the window, my feet were, and someone was holding both of my legs and part of my abdomen and trying to pull me out the window. I couldn't see anything, even with my eyes wide open. I remember that the other ""creature eyes"" were gone, as though frightened off. Kore grabbed my arm and tried to hold me in, but I remember looking up and seeing the stars for a brief moment.

Then it's blackness. I feel a lot of time has passed, and I'm waking up in a stuffy box, or a coffin. I fought to get free, but it was locked or otherwise held down. There was someone outside the box walking around and digging through things, so I called out to them, ""I'm in here! Let me out!"" I felt a breath of cool air as the box was opened, and saw the face of someone I've never met before. He seemed relieved to see me.

Then it's darkness again, and I'm driving home from school at a stoplight, like I woke up from a daydream. I checked the date when I got home, it had been almost 3 months since my sleepover at Kore's. 

I called my friends one at a time to try to piece together what had happened. Kore said that we went to bed the night of the sleepover, though she felt defeated and I had nothing to say. The next morning, we ate breakfast and I left early. I wouldn't talk unless I had to, it was almost like I was acting and pretending to be me, and not doing a good job of it (I'm a fairly excitable/animated person, but I seemed robotic and distant). My girlfriend said that we'd had sex a couple times during the time I couldn't remember, but I never achieved full pleasure and didn't seem that into it. When I pleased her, it was very methodical and bland, and after she had orgasmed, I'd sit aside (rather than hold her tenderly). My mother hadn't noticed anything other than that I seemed rather distracted. I managed to complete and turn in homework for my classes, though definitely not the way I would normally, and I was barely passing now.

I don't know how much of what happened to me was a nightmare, but if it was a nightmare... then why did it last so long? Why can't I remember from mid-July to the start of October 2010? I have tried to think it through logically, using evidence where I could, but it's like I was just going through the motions of my normal life, but it wasn't me. I wish I could find out who the man was that opened the box, but I have a feeling he doesn't exist, somehow...

Any similar experiences??

None of the streetlights were lit even though it was dark out, and none of the houses were lit. Also, the street was much much longer than I remember it being. After a few moments of freaking out, I turned around and went back onto the main road.

I turned around at the school and came back to my grandma's neighborhood, once again turning left on Westgate. This time everything was normal: streetlights and houses were lit, and grandma's house was right there at the end of the street like it should have been.

I was ~8 years old. In my school system, the gifted and talented students got together at one elementary school instead of going to school that day. It was in a basement of the elementary, and there was a door in the computer room that led directly to a staircase outside, which most of us used as we weren't actually attending that elementary. I loved that class, it's part of a program that's supposed to challenge us and teach us more than the usual, (going to the philharmonic, learning language and history we wouldn't learn in our regular classes, job shadowing, essays, and other cool stuff) and it was one of the days where we were just going cool logic puzzles and worksheets. I had unfinished work and adhd, and was having a ton of trouble focusing, so the teachers sat me down in the computer room right next to the class to finish in peace. I remember sitting at the computer and after a few minutes, distinctly thinking the following:

&gt;I will walk down the staircase in a large purple coat covered in snow and I will be cold. I will be very late on a Wednesday. I will say, ""I'm sorry, my dog got out and we had to chase her before I could leave."" I will then put my coat away and sit in this seat. 

I thought it was just my mind wandering, so I let it go, but I did write it on my paper. After all, I don't have a purple coat, I don't have a dog that gets out, and it's the middle of August. I got a puppy in a month. And I almost forgot all about it. The dog started to run out when we opened the door. Winter came, and one day when my aunt dropped my cousin off before work, the dog ran out. I ran out after to catch her, it took an hour, but after getting my coat all wet and my feet all cold, I got her and was ready to go to school. My aunt accidentally left her coat, and my mom suggested I wear it since it would be warmer. It was a purple coat. Nothing really clicked in my mind yet, as my eight year old mind wasn't really retaining much from august. I walked down the staircase, through the side door, looked at my teacher and just said, ""I'm sorry, my dog got out and we had to chase her before I could leave."". The feeling I got at that moment was kind of like deja vu, but so much stronger and a little terrifying. I went into the main class and the lady was passing our papers back. Since we only went to this special class once a week, there was quite a build up of papers, reaching back to august. I remembered the note I made on that homework. If it was there, I knew the future. I waited so patiently for my paper to come, nervous and sweating. After I finally got the paper back, I looked for my note. I could see where I wrote it. The impressions were still in the paper. It had been erased. I went up to the other teacher and asked why my note was erased. She told me not to write on my work if it didn't pertain to my work. I was shocked. 

It's happened several times since then, where I just make up these oddly specific stories and then they just happen months later. I try not to make up any stories now, and my mind is even having a hard time not making one at this moment. I'm terrified that I'll make up someone getting hurt on accident, and then it'll be my fault. I don't want that to happen. It's horrible to think about.

1363288783.0,56,self.Glitch_in_the_Matrix,1aavfx,"One glitch, brush it aside right? But 3 in the space of 24 hours...",81,25,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix/comments/1aavfx/one_glitch_brush_it_aside_right_but_3_in_the/,"So basically yesterday evening I went to sleep. I left my laptop playing a movie, I fell asleep shortly after. About 30 minutes into the movie I wake up and realize I was pretty tired so I just pause the movie and put my laptop on sleep (I'm lazy and reawakening it is quicker than the whole shut down, start up crap). So I close the lid so the screen doesn't get dusty, damn it loves dust. Anyway I go back to sleep only to awake to the sound of my laptop's power on. I think I'm just hearing shit so I open my eyes, then I wake up because I realize this shouldn't have happened. The laptop was closed, yet now the screen is upright and it is at the screen asking for my password. At this point I was too tired to care and I brushed it off, I put it back on sleep and joined my laptop in slumber. 

After a while of sleeping, around 2-3 hours or so for some reason, I felt urged to wake up. I still don't know why but I just felt like I had to wake up, my first thought was my laptop. Maybe because it was still on my mind from the first instance, maybe the first time was a vivid dream, but I knew that wasn't true. I knew I was awake both times, and right away I look at my laptop. This time I actually got really really scared. My laptop screen was still black but it was upright and I knew for a fact that I had twice put it down. Then it fucking turned on. That was possibly the scariest shit I've seen because I was staring at it while it just turned on... no buttons were pressed. It just made a sound and turned on. 

I grabbed it quickly and entered my password (not going to lie my first thought was someone was trying to contact me) and the screen was at the same scene in the movie I was watching, still paused. Confused I just left it and although I was freaked the fuck out I still slept comfortably... I think it was because I didn't feel physically in danger. 

We'll consider that one of the glitches. The second happened today. I was opening my curtains when the clips the curtain hang on snapped off, they were old and I instantly got the blame for ""pulling them downwards"", who the fuck pulls a curtain *down* to open it... I'm not really sure this can be considered a glitch but I only mention it because it happened between other events and it felt weird at the time. 

So the third and weirdest glitch to happen today (so far)... I was going into my garage to grab some drinks I had stored there and as I was leaving I opened the door and the door began to fall. I was completely confused as fuck and I tried to hold on to the door but it was really heavy and it just dropped, right onto concrete. 

Now let me explain why this is so weird... The door has a **solid** metal frame with glass on both sides. The door itself fits into another metal frame, which is extremely solid. The metal hinges just completely snapped off. Both the upper metal hinge and the lower metal hinge. It doesn't really make sense at all because of how sturdy this door is. I took pictures of the hinges that broke off because I knew immediately people wouldn't believe me when I told this story. 

I know you guys will ask so here they are:

[The top metal hinge](http://i.imgur.com/J0iiYM4.png)

[The bottom metal hinge](http://i.imgur.com/La7t0S7.png)

[The door's hinge](http://i.imgur.com/W6EqQ88.png)

[The other door hinge](http://i.imgur.com/255TZAe.png)

I got some other pictures but I don't want to give away my location because my garage doesn't have a fucking door right now... anyway before any of you guys think I'm lying because I said it fell on to concrete, it did. I moved the door onto the mud patch we have so my dog doesn't cut himself and I cleaned up the glass before I took any pictures so he doesn't get hurt. It is only 7:20 PM and I think more shit will happen today...",,False,,t5_2tcwa,1363290102.0,,,True,t3_1aavfx,http://www.reddit.com/r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix/comments/1aavfx/one_glitch_brush_it_aside_right_but_3_in_the/,

I'm a security guard for a large factory plant.  You know those movies you see where there's a checkpoint booth at the end of a long road, just before the complex where the protagonist is heading?  That's pretty much me.  Long, block long road, booth, giant gates, complex.

So I'm sitting there yesterday, and a vehicle I don't recognize turns onto the factory-road and slowly makes it's way up to my booth.  I looked down for a moment to gather up my clipboard and visitor badges, and then I looked up again.  No car.

When I looked down, he/she had been half way to my booth.  There was no where for it to turn around without me seeing it, and there certainly wasn't the back of a car heading back towards the main road.

The first instance, my house keys. One day I placed them on my desk so that I could find them the next day when I needed to leave the house. I go to take out the trash and do a bit of tidy-upping around, then upon returning to my room I glance at my desk to find that there are no keys. I assumed at the time that they had just fallen off my desk somehow and that I could find them after dinner which I had just begun preparing. 

After dinner and a nice nap, I decide that it is high time to locate my keys, thinking that they must not have gotten too far. That evening I spent nearly an hour looking for my keys. I moved everything, my desk was moved about, drawers were dumped, magnets were used. Nothing. Not a single sign of the keys. At this point I figure the struggle is futile. I get my spare keys out of the cupboard and use them until I can find my keys. 

*Three months later*I walk into my room, take a look at my desk, and sure as hell. There are my keys. Exactly where I had put them three months ago. I did make note, however, that now they were beat to hell. They were attached to a blue carabiner which was now nearly silver from all the scuff-marks and scratches. 

Similar things have happened to other things. My flash drive once disappeared along with a few months of work on it. But this hasn't happened to just the one flash drive, no. That one came back, in the same fashion as the keys. So did the second flash drive when it went missing just after finding my old one. I fear these occurrences won't be the last. Just today my beloved calculator has gone missing. Normally I would think that I have simply misplaced it. But no. I have vivid memory of placing my calculator into a pocked in my backpack and zipping it up, safe and sound. Yet when I return home, it is gone.

But months later, when I retold the story some one mentioned that Lincoln had always been on the $5 bill. I left confused and went home and tried to prove him wrong but I found I didn't even know who I had seen on it before. I looked through portraits of presidents and couldn't find the original one.

The night that it happened, we were *not* sleeping in the same room. 

I remember waking up one morning to a particularly vivid dream. I was in a hallway, with brown paneling halfway up the walls. The hallway had an elevator at the end. At some point, I ended up in the elevator with the friend. We were trapped in it, and seawater was pouring in from the top edges of the elevator. We managed to pry the doors open, but it was stuck between floors. So, with the water rushing in, one of us (me) squeezed out the top and went for help. I turned back and saw her peering from between the floor and top of the elevator, and I ran down the hallway and out the door to the parking lot. I jumped in a red Geo Metro and noticed a baby on the front-seat. I peeled out of the parking lot and drove to the airport. 

The next day, I tell my friend that I had a weird dream. She says, ""Really? Me too. I dreamed about elevators. I hate elevators."" I eyed her suspiciously, and asked, ""Was it... flooding?"" Her face lit up, and she confirmed that it was. Being a scientific kid, I told her we should stop talking and type it out instead. So, we did. Then we compared. 

Everything but the hallway color matched. The strangest thing was that she told the dream from her perspective; she said I ""left her"" in the elevator and drove away in a red car, whereas I experienced getting into the car and driving away.

Ten years later, and I still can't explain it. I'm very skeptical that this happened, but I can distinctly recall typing the sheet and comparing to find that they were the same. However, I know memory is fallible, so... I was motivated by this post to send her a message on Facebook. I haven't spoken to her in ten years, but if this happened then she probably remembers it. 

And if she doesn't, then she'll think I'm a little crazy, but you know... for science :)

A few nights ago my girlfriend was having a bad dream where our child was kidnapped. Before he would return her, my girlfriend had to solve a puzzle. Whilst solving the puzzle her dream went off in a tangent (as dreams sometimes do) and she was selecting from a pile of tools to use as a weapon. At that moment she awoke due to my now anticipated sleep-gibberish.

She went to get a glass of water and returned to hear me say the phrase ""Forget the tools, solve the puzzle"".

I had a dream where I was driving with a friends to a chalet (country side house) that we rented for a long weekend. We are driving and I am at the wheel. We are having fun and I see a sign that there is a slope coming up (that yellow sign with a degree ex: 15° slope). I didnt pay much attention and kept the speed I was doing, about 80kms/h. We reach the slope that goes downwards and I realize that I am going too fast to make the turn on that slope, lose control of the car and we end up on the other side of the road and crash. I wake up at that time and don't know if we died or not, but it seemed like it was a pretty fatal crash.

Fast-forward a year, a bunch of my friends (not the same people as in the dream) are going to a chalet outside of town. Its almost night time and we are driving on those sloppy roads that go up and down, like a mountain.

As I am coming up one of those slopes, I see a sign that says tight turn and an inclined slope ahead. And at that time it hits me that I should slow down. Notice that the car is full (5 people) and there is a lot of stuff in the trunk, so its pretty heavy. I am doing around the same speed as in the dream, around 80kms/h. I reach the top of that slope and its about to go down, there is even a special way made for trucks that are going too fast to slow them down, like a road with a lot of gravel.

So by remembering what happened in my dream, I slow down to around 50-60km/h and try to make the turn. Almost didnt made it as we were much heavier than I expected. But no one noticed but me, i felt it at the wheel. I make the turn on that slope and we arrive safely to the chalet.

I will never forget this, as me and 4 other of my very good friends could of seen the end at that day. I did not even think of slowing down before that dream hit me.

**TL;DR:** Dreamed crashing after missing a turn on a heavy slope. Year later, same situation, remembered the dream, slowed down, made the tight turn on the heavy slope. Got home safe.

4 years ago, me and my girlfriend were coming back from a trip at the sea. I was driving, it was a 600km drive, it was night and we were talking about American politics. I remember everything so vividly like it's just been yesterday.

As I was driving, I try to pass a truck and all of a sudden the white fence that was protecting the road/cars from falling into the deep chasm on each side of the road, appears in front. I break as heavily as I can, and we stop, literally just a few centimeters from the fence, seeing the headlights fade into complete darkness that was just the hundred meter drop in front of us. 

We're petrified and we just stand there for what it felt like 5 minutes while cars were passing us by and honking. We say no words, I go in reverse and continue driving for about 30 minutes without us saying a single word. 

All this time everything felt strange, out of place. You know that feeling when you say a word many times it stops having a meaning? That's how everything felt; the steering wheel, the sings on the edge of the road, the other cars.. everything so out of place and unreal. I made nothing of it and blamed it on the near-death shock I just had. Then, after all this dead silence, she mumbles something which I can't understand and then yells from the top of her lungs:

""WE DIED, WE'RE DEAD, WHY ARE  YOU DOING THIS?""

I pride myself in being a rational guy, but I must admit, her words shook me to the core. Still, I realize that this is just from the shock and start comforting her. We start talking and I tell her that we were in no way close to any danger. ""There was no chasm below the road, I looked"", I lie to her. I then remember that the fence was bent, just like another car has crashed into it and tell her that that's why the fence is there so cars don't just fall down. From shock, I turn to anger, to the fact that the road had no signs to notify me of the upcoming turn.

We keep on driving through the night, and by the time we get home, we already forgot about it, back to joking, and enjoying our memories from the trip. We go to bed, and when I wake up, everything seems normal, and we go out with some friends to talk about the trip.

After we get back, we download the trip pictures from the camera and start looking through them. After going through about 50 pictures she asks: ""Is this how I look?"" ... ""What do you mean"", I say... ""Am I this ugly?"".. she asks again. 

I look at her thinking that she's joking or something. She's a bit of a narcissist and she knows she's very beautiful. I tell her, that, yeah, this is how she looks, that's what pictures do. She then continues to swiftly browse through the rest of the pictures continuously saying that she's ugly, that that's not her from the pictures.

I thought that maybe she just doesn't like her tan or whatever, but no, she started crying and crying. If you ever saw a small kid cry, barely catching their breath, that's how she cried. I couldn't stop her, she was in in uncontrollable shake.  This went on for THREE HOURS until she simply passed out and fell asleep. 

The next morning I thought that all that phase is behind us, but no, as soon as she woke up she started crying again, and kept on going and going. She called her mother, sent her the pictures to confirm that that's her from the pictures. Her mother, as confused as I was, says that, yep, that's her from the pictures...

She fell into a deep depression for 2 weeks. I tried everything, consolations, gifts, advice, nothing helped. Eventually she stopped and said something along the lines that it doesn't matter who she is now, I'm the same and she loves me...

Since then, nothing else out of the ordinary happened, but I can't take my mind of that night and those following weeks, and can't think that maybe we actually died back there, but for some reason it simply didn't affect me, or I just don't remember it, but she does. We talked with other people about the ""near death accident"" and she always says that it wasn't near... we died. She says it in a joking way, expecting laughs, but I know she believes it. 

tl;dr: Me and girlfriend were driving in the night. Had a near death accident. She says we actually died. She doesn't recognize herself from pictures.

Last summer I decided to replace the horn on my car, as the original one was getting faulty, and it was a bit crappy anyway. In order to undo the bolts holding the horn in place I used my socket set. I used the 13mm socket. I distinctly remember using 13mm as I thought ""hmm unlucky for some!"".

I finished fitting the new horn, and started packing away my tools, when I noticed my socket was missing. I searched everywhere and even looked in the engine bay to see if it had fallen in there. Nada. Zilch. Zero. I eventually gave up and figured it must have fallen into the drain over which the car was parked. 

Fast forward to November, and I was off work as I was unwell. One day I felt a bit better and decided to go out and buy myself some new jogging bottoms. Ive been wearing them regularly since then.

Last night I was heading out to watch some Ice Hockey, and I noticed the joggers I was wearing had gotten dirty, and so I decided to change them. The next pair I pulled out of my wardrobe were my favorite pair, and had just been through the wash.

As I pulled them off the coathanger, there was was a clang, and out dropped the 13mm socket that had gone missing some 4/5 months earlier, and at least 3 months before I even bought the trousers.

Not in a violent way but I heard it unclick from the side and open up. At this point I would normally be freaking out but for some reason it all just seemed so calm. I got up thinking my dog was probably awake but when I opened the door and looked out the big kitchen window it was the most beautiful snowfall I've ever seen! Huge snow flakes falling so gently and for some reason the outside sensor light was on but it just made the snowflakes look so clear and pretty.

Although it seems slightly 'horror story', I'm posting it here rather than /r/nosleep because it is a true story and I do believe it occurred due to a glitch rather than anything supernatural.

I was sitting with my mum and dad in our living room, I was 18 at the time and visiting home from university, so it was just a boring Friday or Saturday night with the folks (I don't remember which). I'm sitting there just chilling out watching some telly - your fairly typical suburban scene is taking place, mum and dad snuggled on the sofa, dog snoring in the hallway, something I'm not all that interested in on the television.

Anyway, there is a very sudden change in atmosphere. A wave hits me. I become overcome with a sensation I've never felt before - I'll assume it was dread. Not only that, I'm now paralysed. Fear then follows. The scene I'm now witnessing is shocking, terrifying, and strangely feels 'third party' - as in it feels like I'm witnessing it behind my field of vision. A black hole, like a pit, has opened in the middle of our floor, and these 3 very tall (comfortable just over 2 meters, I'm 194cm and felt small compared to them) skeletal creatures are climbing out of it, 2 are cloaked. The first one makes eye contact with me. I can tell you our living room wasn't very big, and these things felt almost like they were on top of me, so the eye contact became even more gut-wrenching. The simply walk and pass through the wall perpendicular to me. The whole time I can see our TV screen just emitting an ominous blue glow. I can see my dad's glasses illuminated with a pure light, and a white noise is all I can hear.

This event passes. However, thats not the end of the weirdness. I am clearly visibly shaken up. To the extent to which my Dad asked me a couple of times if I was ok. The other weird thing, this event felt like it lasted seconds, but the TV show has changed. Before it all happened, the programme was in full swing, so its been at least a few minutes, if not more like 10 or 15.

Like I said at the start. This it not my shit attempt at a spooky story. This did happen, and having recently discovered this sub, I thought it would be interesting to get your views on this. I have a friend very interested in this topic, who has had experiences similar to this and attributed it to my third eye going overtime, but that feels very abstract.

For the past few years, whenever I get lost (sometimes when I'm *not* lost and know where I am) I suddenly find myself at my destination, long before I should have arrived.

It happened when I was trying to find my college before I went there back in 2009;  I went from being lost in downtown to suddenly in the middle of the campus.

It happened when I went hiking on some trails I knew very well;  It should have been a circuit that would have lasted hours, instead my girlfriend and I ended up back at the entrance in 20 minutes.

It happened *to my parents and sister* when they came to visit once; my sister said they were lost, then at the next red light (we were in seperate cars) they were right behind me, out of nowhere.  They described the route they took, and instead of being behind me they should have been on the other side of town.  Genetics?

The last time it happened was a few weeks ago.  I was driving home travelling east-west, and I know I didn't get turned around.  Then I realized I was in the Eastern part of town.  My town is on the coast, with the bay on the East side.  I had been travelling West to end up on the Eastern side of town.  *What.*

For most cases, especially the hiking case, if I were to trace a line from my starting point to my end, there would be a break in the line.

I'm packing the dishwasher in our family home in the kitchen where I can see my mum, brother, sister and father sitting on different couches watching TV over the kitchen counter. 

I am almost finished when I see a strange blur in the dining room (directly adjacent to the kitchen). I look closer and it's in the shape of a tall man. About 6' tall. He is transparent and looks what you would imagine a wraith looks like. Shadowy. But it has a very distinct outline. 
 It's like those ""cut along this line"" outline around this figure. Like this ------------.

I ask to my mum.
""Mum. Who's that in the dining room?""

Mum replies, obviously thinking I'm playing a practical joke.
""Who? There's no one there Ross.""

I'm starting to feel a bit uneasy now.

""No. I'm serious.  There's a man in the dining room staring at me!""

I head to my mum on the opposite side of the dining table and it moves towards me. I stop. Step back and it gives chase. I get the biggest frisson/ASMR chills and I know it wants to hurt me.

I run away around the table and scream the most hollow chills you can make. I can still hear them echoing in my head. I do a couple laps around the table with my family seriously concerned for my sanity. And I rush to my mums sofa and fall down exhausted at her knees. 

She leans over to shush me and nurse me and I look to my left and see the figure closing in on me with an outstretched arm. I shut my eyes tightly and hold onto my mums legs and everything goes black.

Cut to one day after close. I had just finished cleaning up my section of retail space when I saw someone had left a bunch of shelving parts lying around. It's probably worth mentioning that the store at this point was split into two sections; the old part of the store that was open to customers and had all our merchandise, and the new section that was still under construction and had all of the materials being stored in it on skids. It was like a mirror of the old store, just everything hadn't been put together yet. Anyways I went to the new section of the store to put all the parts back on their proper skids, and I zone out while doing it like I always do.

I put the last piece of shelving on the skid where it belongs, came back to reality for a while, then I turn around and I am greeted by a big wall of skids. All around where I was were skids of materials stacked over my head with no room to go between or around. I stand there for around five minutes looking to see where I came in, or how I got around it.... but nothing. The materials on the skids were wrapped in this plastic cling wrap, so they had enough grip that I was able to climb up 2 of them that formed a corner, but even when I was on the other side I saw no way that I could have got in without something as extreme as climbing my height in shifty metal parts. I must be very good at parkour while daydreaming.

This was at night after close. Had it been daytime I probably could have seen the other skid of the same material in a much more accessible spot. ",,False,,t5_2tcwa,False,,,True,t3_15nnnz,http://www.reddit.com/r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix/comments/15nnnz/the_ct_zone/,

One night, while we were walking through the downtown area, and my dad was in the hotel room because he got sick, my mom decided to stop at a Burger King to get some food for my dad. I heard her talk about it, but my mind must have never processed it, becuase I kept on walking as my mother and sister entered the Burger King unaware that I didn't. After about 2 minutes of me walking by myself, I realized that my family was nowhere to be seen, and I started freaking out. I guess because I was very distraught, I didn't think to walk back to the Burger King, so instead I tried to find my hotel where my dad was at. It took me nearly 1 hour of walking through downtown by myself and getting lost at 11 PM to find the right hotel. When I did, I knocked on our room door and entered to find both my sister and my father crying. They told me that my mom had gone out in her car looking for me, and then they called her telling her that I had come back. That day would remain the scariest day of my life for about 7 years, when I brought up the incident during a conversation about our multiple trips to Gatlinburg. I had not talked about the incident in that 7 year period because I knew it caused a lot of pain for both my parents and me. Anyway, when I did, my parents, as well as my sister, looked at me like I was insane, and said that I never got lost in Gatlingurg. They did, however, remember my dad being sick and them stopping at a Burger King, but they insisted that I was with them the entire time. I know memory is not accurate, but I remember the experience so vividly, that it freaks me out, and I still believe that it happened. And no, my parents would not play a prank that horrible on me.

tl;dr I got lost in Gatlinburg, Tennessee, but my family says that it never happened.

The way the house was set up was kind of odd. It had kind of a balcony type that ran across the house for the upper two floors, with staircases from the bottom (outside) that led up to each floor. 

http://imgur.com/VDEzg

The kitchen and family room was on the top floor, and a door led straight to it from the balcony. You could also see the entire top floor except for the bedroom if the door was closed from the balcony due to the large windows. 

One morning, my sister and I woke up and decided to head to the beach. At the time, my mom, dad, aunt, and cousin was also awake and sitting in the kitchen/family room. After returning from the beach about 15 minutes later, my sister and I headed up to the top floor and tried to get into the kitchen. Unfortunately the door was locked. We knocked and yelled a little bit, but to no avail. Figuring they couldn't hear us, we decided to look through the open windows and signal to them. Except, they weren't there. We could see the entire top floor, where 15 minutes ago they were all sitting and eating breakfast. Wondering where they went, my sister and I headed back down and entered the house through the back door. When we headed back up to the kitchen from inside the house, we saw them all sitting. Eating breakfast. Not looking like they moved at all. It had taken us about a minute to go through the back door and come back up.

 Suspicious of a prank, I went up to my dad and asked him where he had gone. His only response was confusion, and insisting that he had been there the whole time. 

I'm still not totally convinced that they didn't tragically die and turn into ghosts while we were gone.

The drive there was normal, everything was good until we got on the bus from the parking lot to the park. I had the strongest deja vu that I've ever had. I just brushed it off, thought it was odd but didn't worry too much about it.
Anyhow as we are going to get our tickets the guy at the front counter looks at us very oddly and says, ""Huh, weren't you guys just here?""
I respond, ""No, it's been awhile since we've been to Disneyland.""
""That's so strange, I could swear I just let you two in less than an hour ago...Must just be deja vu."" 
Then to my surprise my gf says, ""Yeah it does feel familiar, perhaps you've let us in another time? A few months ago?""

John finished by putting a little hat on his head and saying ""what should we name him?""

(side note: I have not been able to find this book. this is the final thing I would need to determine that all of this is not just something I am misremembering in my head. it was a book about a family of monsters and the baby monster's name was Zoot.

I debated it, but felt weird enough about it that I will. 

Here is the text of my original post (with a couple corrections);

This is going to sound like the most irrational and silly thing ever, hence the throwaway. To be honest, I feel like an idiot typing it out at all.

I am in my 30s. I am pretty normal, all in all, doing alright for myself, content in my life, and so on. 

A few weeks ago, I stumbled upon a video somewhere on Reddit. I think it was in TOMT, asking about a song in the video. The description sounded like I might know what it was, so clicky click. 

There was someone talking in the video, and the very instant I heard the voice it was as if someone had stabbed me. I don't mean it was horrible, but it was honestly as if my chest clenched up. It was a weird emotional pain. I was mesmerized. It wasn't as if they were talking about anything that would trigger that sort of thing. 
A few clicks more and there they were on camera.

I do not even know how to explain ... The closest I can come... Imagine being in love with someone, being infatuated, and watching them from afar. It was like that, only more painful. But there was nothing behind the emotion. There was nothing rational that would explain it. I don't know the person. But it felt like I *should*. It felt as if I knew them, cared very deeply about them at some point, but had somehow forgotten them. 

I actually thought I believed in love at first sight. I have been attracted to someone the first time I met them. But they fit into the category of ""my type"". The attraction was distinctly physical. This was completely different. They aren't what I would have considered my type. They aren't what would typically be considered particularly attractive by common standards. There is no rational explanation I can come up with.

I have absolutely no clue what triggered this. It is seriously a wtf moment. I do not know them, will never meet them, and have no clue if I would like them at all in real life... but still it feels like I lost someone I loved. Like I am an amnesiac with no recollection of someone I dearly loved, with only the emotion itself and the incredible sadness of not knowing where it comes from remaining.

...and that sums it up.
It is really a strange and distressing feeling because I do not know the other person at all and there is absolutely no reason I can come up with to have such a strong emotion toward them. If I just found them really physically attractive, and had that sort of attraction toward them, I could understand. But it isn't that, it honestly feels as if I really should know them and know why I feel this way, but for some reason I can't recall things properly. And it is killing me inside in some way that I can't.",,False,,t5_2tcwa,False,,,True,t3_1ikrhf,http://www.reddit.com/r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix/comments/1ikrhf/someone_told_me_i_should_post_this_here/,

My precognition hasn't necessarily taken form of a rem sleep dream. It's always taken form in a daydream. Lasting only about two-five minutes. 

The first one I remember having was both the most vague and the one that hit me the hardest.

I was about nine years old, living in California. It was during the summer time, and I was sitting outside with the neighbor kids. They are talking to each other, and I kind of just ""zoned out"".

I pictured walking up about five flights of green stairs, in an old brick building. It smelled like a giant basement. There were barely any windows leading up. I finally get to the top floor of this building, I finally see some windows. Large, dirty windows, covered by tall trees. The only light that was coming in revealed the dust that was stirring up in the hall where I was walking.

I reach a door, I can tell it's to a classroom now. I am in a school. 
I walk inside the classroom, but it is kind of off. All of the desks are put together in a ""U"" shape, and there was a desk all the way in the back. I saw children and a teacher, all of their faces were blurred out. No distinguishable features, other than hair. I looked around the room, and noticed outside one of the windows, it was snowing. In the area of California I lived in, it never snowed, and I had only seen it once visiting my grandpa in Northern California. After seeing the snow, I snapped out of it. I didn't think much of it that day, I daydreamed all the time. Later, I wondered for a while about it. Why so odd? Where was I? Where were their faces?

Years had passed, I had forgotten it altogether.
It was 2001, when my family decided to move to West Virginia. My grandmother on my dad's side of the family had fallen ill, and my dad wanted us to be nearby.
I was enrolled in my new elementary school in late November. It was a one-level building, fairly new. I had been there for two days when they came to my family and said I couldn't go there anymore, I was out of the district.
So at the beginning of the week, I started another school.
A big brick building, six floors, five flights of green stairs, musty basement smell... I knew where I was. I started shaking before I got to the classroom, it had to be a coincidence. I get to that classroom, and the desks are forming a ""U"", the teacher's desk was in the back, with the snowy window behind her. Only this time, I could see their faces.

Thought I'd share my only glitch moment with you all!

For the last six months, I have been catching the train to the next town for my job. When it's time to come home, I catch the 4.11 train. During those first few weeks at my new job, I would often finish late (being eager to leave a good impression etc.) and need to catch the 4.50 home instead. 

So I did this for a couple of months until one day I left work late and went to catch the 4.50 train. I arrived at the station and there was nobody there. It was cold and getting dark. The train was late. After around 15 minutes, I started searching on my phone for information about delays but couldn't find anything useful. I walked over to the timetable on the wall to see when the next train would arrive: 5.54

It was at this point that I realised the timetable had the 4.11 and the 5.54 as consecutive journeys. Nothing in between. 


I was so confused! The timetable was old and weathered and had undoubtedly been up on that wall since I started my job. I checked thetrainline app on my phone (where I had originally learned of the 4.50) and the information matched the timetable!


I swear to you, I had caught that train multiple times along with a lot of other passangers too. The weathering of the timetable told me it wasn't a new service and that the timetable hadn't recently changed.


The only way I can rationalise it is in thinking that every single time I caught the 4.50, it was actually a very late 4.11 train and by some huge coincidence, it was always late by the same amount of time and only on the days that I was late too.


I always catch the 4.11 now but the experience was so concrete to me that even the other week, I was late out of work and had walked nearly all the way to the train station for the 4.50 when I remembered that it doesn't exist.


Now, if I'm late out of work, I catch the bus.",,False,,t5_2tcwa,False,,,True,t3_ujw6w,http://www.reddit.com/r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix/comments/ujw6w/the_train_that_never_existed/,

I take note of him and kind of 'zoom in' on him for just a moment.

I look away and little dude turns around and starts walking, I look back and he turns back around and does it again...

...Now here is the thing...I've been noticing that nearly WHOEVER I look at lately, where ever I am they turn immediately and look right back at me...which makes me think about 'Inception'...and I already have the perspective that 'life is just a dream' so this makes me wonder...wtf is going on with the dream?

Right before I sat down to type this I went to put in for a new job.  I walked up BEHIND the person who I was going to give the application to, he was a cashier IN THE MIDDLE OF CHECKING SOMEONE ELSE OUT, as soon as I walked up to him he dropped what he was doing, turned clear around and told me he could take the application BEFORE I SAID A WORD OR MADE A SOUND.

Ok people of reddit/glitch, help me figure this one out, please!  Why is the universe paying SO MUCH attention to me all the sudden?  

I do have one other thing to share.  about 2 months ago I was by myself at a park meditating and I had the thought come into my mind that all that  happened to Buddha is that he had the totality of the universe suddenly use him as it's central perspective, as soon as I had that thought I felt like God, or the Universe or The Oversoul or whatever suddenly looked my way Eye or Sauron style.  Now, mind you, if you look out at some of those nebulas in space they look just like eyes sometimes.

Here's the thing, most of my life when I would look at people they wouldn't look back, not unless they were attractive females near my age.  Now suddenly I just glance at people and 9/10 they immediately look back my way.  What is this?  What's going on?
I can tell you that physically there is nothing that really sticks out about me, I'm an average enough guy in his early 30s.  My mother tells me that I freak people out but honestly, I think she does that a lot worse that I do, I just keep to myself as I always have done...in fact in general in life I'm kinda a ninja, or at least I was until recently and now suddenly I can't go around unnoticed. :(

I was staying at my grandmas house on christmas eve (of 2012, so pretty recently) with the family. On the night of christmas eve when I was getting ready for bed, I checked my phone when I stopped in the doorframe as I was exiting the bathroom. I distinctly noted the time, 12:48 and thought to myself ""Oh, I have 12 minutes to browse the internet before 1:00 when I should go to bed."" I immediately walked 5 feet down and across the hallway and into the room where I was staying, where I immediately laid down in bed and turned on my phone to browse the internet. 

It said 1:02 a.m. I was very confused, did 14 minutes just pass in the blink of an eye?

Waiting 30 seconds in front of the microwave seems like an eternity so walking a few feet down a hallway shouldn't even take more than that.

We took both of our cars with us and had a great time, but when we came back home there was a policeman's business card in our door, with a note asking us to call him. 

Naturally, we did, and he came over to our house shortly after that, telling us that our car had been reported in a hit and run accident at a McDonald's down the street a few days ago. The license plate and description of the car matched ours perfectly. The victim of the hit and run said the driver was a young female with short, dark hair, and facial piercings. With that description, it could have been me, but I was sans facial piercings, and out of the state at the time of the accident.

We gave the cop our alibi, which was backed up by all of the family we visited with at the beach, and nothing ever came of it. We assumed the victim got the license plate number wrong in the chaos of the accident.

Fast-forward three years, to my sophomore year of college. I decide to get my lip pierced. After doing this, I think back to that accident. I now match the description of the driver, but do not have the car (it was my father's, and I bought my own car before going to college). Eight months later, I take the lip stud out on a whim, and haven't put it back in since.

Last summer, I sold my car, and my dad passed down his car to me. Again, I think about that accident. Now I have the vehicle, but no longer match the description. 

I've always wondered what would happen if I got some sort of facial piercing again. All the elements would be there for me to have been the driver of the car involved in the hit and run four years ago while past-me and past-car were away on vacation. I'd know I could be in that area in the past because I'd know I was away during those two weeks. But something would go wrong and I'd get seen and recorded because of that hit and run accident, and the cop would come to our house and not be able to take the case anywhere.

It has probably happened once or twice a year, for as long as I can remember. My dream is always roughly the same. I'm walking down the street of a city that my dream-self knows very well, talking to my sister about the kind of dress I'm looking to buy.

I don't have a sister, and I don't know a lick of French. But in that moment between dreaming, and waking up, I can still feel the language lingering on my tongue. It's the craziest thing.

Stay with me, this might get a bit long-winded:

Sometime in August 1991, by all rights and accounts, I should have died. For the past 20 years, this memory has been blanked out, and the aforementioned post just rocketed it back into my memory. 

My mum (grandmother) and I were coming home from a trip to a Toys R Us, in southern NJ. I had been saving up pennies and such and finally cashed them all in, getting enough money to go get some toy cars and other things. During that summer, she had been on medication to prevent infections or swelling following a cataract operation on her right eye. She could see just fine, but was taking the meds as a preventative measure. This will play a very important part in what happens next.

So we're driving down Rt 9, just outside the town of Smithville, where we lived. All I remember is a loud BANG and seeing the windshield crack in the car. This is where the glitch comes in. I was sitting in the front seat, without a seatbelt on. The next thing I know, I'm looking out the back window of the car, and am scrambling to get the hatch open in our 1989 Ford Escort. My mum had hit the steering wheel, her seatbelt failed. We had hit a telephone pole at what I was later told was almost 45 miles per hour. The whole front of the car was destroyed, and the car had gone part way up the pole. Best I can figure is that she had a reaction to her medication, passed out, and that's when we went across the lanes of traffic, and hit the pole.

I remember being outside the car, and seeing one of the people who lived along there walking off with one of the car's wheelcovers, and thinking that that was wrong, my mum would need that for the car.

We were both put in an ambulance and taken to hospital. I kept coming in and out of consciousness, and remember having a neck brace on me for the rest of the day, until my neighbour came to drive me home. 

Here's the really fucked part, and what I'm (now crying) trying to understand: I always sat facing the driver in the car, on my knees, with my feet hanging off the side of the seat, when I was little. I was 7 years old and so small enough to do so. There is no reason why I would have been in the back seat. Further, in a front end collision, loose objects, including my 7 year old self, should have gone through the windshield. So how the fuck did I wind up in the back seat?!

My mum crushed her sternum, broke most of her ribs, and had a nasty bruise on her face where her cheek hit the dashboard. I distinctly remember the top of the steering wheel rim being bent, and I could see the foam inside it.

TL;DR - I should have died in a car accident 20 years ago. For whatever reason, the matrix glitched me into the back seat of the car. And here I am.

It's filled with gum, assorted rock candies, some suckers, and miscellaneous drink mixes (apple cider, hot chocolate etc...)

I watched them both leave around 12 pm (said goodbye, have a safe trip etc).  I remember because I had just gotten a new phone and was quickly showing it off and that was the time on the lock screen.  They both left in separate cars.  At exactly 5:35 pm, I was hurriedly loading my SUV outside with band equipment (I was running late for practice, as usual).  When I stepped out the front door with kick drum in both hands, I noticed a car that looked just like Pat's driving by.  The person driving even looked like Pat.  Then I realized, it was Pat.  We made eye contact, and I made face at him, just assuming he'd already come back from Kentucky.  At first, I though he was making a face back, but then I realized it was a look of total confusion, almost horror.  This all happened extremely fast, maybe 10 seconds.  I didn't really think anything of it, I was more preoccupied with running late at that point.  I remember watching him keep driving down the street and thinking it was weird he was going that way, but I let it go.

About two hours later, my other roommate Joe walked in the house and I asked him if he knew Pat was already back.  Joe laughed and said, ""No, I left a bit early with another friend, they're still driving back, he's not already back.""  ""No man, I saw him drive by the house around 5:30.""  Joe balked.  ""There's no way, its a 7 hour round trip, he couldn't have been back, we didn't finish the project until 4 and I know he was there because he was in the picture we took.""  I called Pat to further confirm this, Pat said he was still on his way back.

I'm sure it was him I saw driving.  His car is an old green Honda, only one like it in town.  The more I though about it, the direction he was driving didn't really make any sense, he never parks his car on the side of the house, and he wouldn't have just driven through that way, the way the street directions go he would have been way out of his way.  His expression was again, very startled and concerned, like I shouldn't have been doing what I was doing.  Time wise, it would have been impossible for him to be there if he was in the picture take at 4 in Kentucky.

TLDR I saw my roommate drive in front of our house when he was 175 miles away.

So I received a cheap wooden cross a string when I was 14 and I wore it for a few years until I misplaced it and haven't seen it since.

One afternoon, in a blistering hot July day, I was in a friends backyard where we were passing the time swimming in his pool and drinking lots of ice tea. Someone got hold of a soccer ball so the four of us began passing the ball back and forth, trying to get dry so we could go back inside. We were all shirtless, obviously, as we had just gotten out of the pool. 

We had played for about 15 minutes when I noticed that my cross was missing. ""Shit!"" I said, ""One of you must have broken my string."" But I then realized that the string was still tied around my neck. We spent a minute looking for the cross, luckily the grass had been cut that morning and we found it easily. 

The glitch is that the cross was not broken and the string was not broken. The only physical possibility to remove the cross from the string was to untie the string or break the cross. It took a few minutes to untie the string (it had been double knotted for about 2 years), I slipped the cross back on, and it stayed on my neck for another year until I lost it.

(Backgroud)
I lived with my mom and we always moved. Mostly because we were poor, and with that being said each apt we moved into was small and sometimes smaller than the one prior. I always wanted to move into a big house with a room bug enough to play in and have lots and lots of toys. 

(Dream)

Mother picks me up from school and we head home. She passes our apt and says that we moved. I'm thinking ""oh great, a smaller place"". We drive quite a distance and I'm bored so I start looking out the window and observe the new area. Nothing special just a gas station, a poor neighborhood and a new suburb looking area. I knew which would be ours so I lost all hope of it being what I wanted. My mother passes the poor neighborhood and we drive into the suburban meighborhood. We pull into a corner house drive way and my mom says ""welcome to our new home""! I get out and look at the house. A nice two story house with some bushes in the front covering the front window and a lonely tree in the middle of our front lawn. I walk inside go up the stairs, there's an extra living room and my play station is hooked up to it! There's a door that leads to one room in the 'extra living room' and a small hallway to the left as soon as I go up the stairs. In that hallway there are 3 more rooms and a restroom. The first room to the right is a blue room, with nothing in there and directly in front is the restroom. The next room to right/at the end of the hallway was my room and a pink room. My room was on the same side as the blue room and the pink one was literally the room at the end of the hallway. Both Door frames touching each other like the corner of a Right angle. I walk into my room it's the biggest room I've ever seen. I had a big tv a little basketball court thingy, sport balls everywhere. I open my closet and I'm flooded with toys! Kind of like in cartoons. While I play with my toys I wake up.


(My Senior Year)

Were moving out of a trailer home from the NS of San Antonio and into a house by lackland AFB sort of the south/southwest side of town. My mother, my little sister and my little brother all in the car &amp; it's taking forever. We end up driving past everything and somewhat in the middle of nowhere. There's a gas station, a post office off the ramp and a school if you continue to drive up the axis. We drive through a ghetto neighborhood and into a nice neighborhood. ABSOLUTELY NOTHING triggers the mother of déjà vu until we pull around the corner and I see the house. The bush, the lonely tree the drive way, the two story house, the garage EVERYTHING is making me dizzy. I had no idea why. After I help take some of the stuff down I walk up the stairs. I see a loft and a door to my Mom and step dads room &amp; ""I'm thinking wow they went all out on this house"" and continue to walk through a hallway. All doors were closed but I knew exactly which room was mine. I open my door.. And it hit me. It was the house I always dreamed of when I was a kid. I then realized everything was on point. Rooms, layout, design, Lawn, neighborhood, school, gas station, LONG DRIVE. The only difference was we were 2nd to being the corner house.

Here goes...

To set the scene: my good friend and I were sitting around my apartment one night smoking a little bit of bud, and generally having a good time. Both of us are experienced users of all manner of psychedelics, and seasoned trippers: needless to say, we both found it strange afterward that we would hallucinate after smoking a couple bowls of reasonably cheap product, as green is seldom enough to produce full-on hallucination in either of us by itself.

At maybe half an hour after partaking, I was sitting on the floor and he on the couch enjoying good conversation with our other friends that were there with us in the room. I started to zone out, and kind of mentally detached myself from the ongoing conversation my friends were having.

I guess I closed my eyes at some point, but I don't remember doing so. I began to see a pulsating sort of a mandalic pattern as though at great distance, and felt myself being bodily drawn towards it, accelerating faster and faster. As I was drawn into the ""event horizon"" (or so it felt, at least) of this pulsating shape, I abruptly snapped back to reality, and shook my head violently. I looked up to see my friend apparently doing the same thing on the couch.

Everyone in the room says they noticed us zoning out at about the same time. My friend reports an identical experience to mine while he was sitting there with his eyes closed. And we ""snapped out of it"" at exactly the same time. There wasn't any music on, or any other external stimuli than the THC that we had in common that should have caused the experience.

The truck had slammed into the light pole, and knocked it over. Flipped 2 times and landed upside down in my front lawn. a foot to my right is where the light pole came crashing down into my yard and 2 feet to my left is where the truck came to rest. 
The strangest part? I opened the door to the truck that should have smashed me like a bug and there was no one inside the truck yet I saw it stop at the stop sign, turn, and speed up. The police found that the truck had no plates and no vin number to id the truck, and were not thrilled when I told them there was no one inside the truck.

I told him in complete confidence and he, being an expert on these sort of things, told me to post here.

Some background: A month ago I moved into accommodation at university - it's a rather understated room with just about everything I need, including an en-suite bathroom. The bathroom is a wet-room kind of thing, with a bolt on the door. 

Two days ago I was hanging out with a friend I made also on my course, a girl who, for the purposes of anonymity, shall be called Emma. Emma is a nice person to be with; intelligent, funny and all that sort of thing. Caveat: she has a boyfriend. 

I feel a bit duplicitous whenever I'm around her, having to hide my attraction, so in a moment of nervousness I stepped into the bathroom and bolted the door, pretending I was changing my t-shirt. 

As soon as I bolted the door I heard voices back inside my room: mine and hers. I was flabbergasted as you can imagine, I was literally hearing myself speaking from behind a door. It sounded like we were fooling around. I listened for about 5-6 seconds.

For some reason my brain thought that someone else was in the room so I undid the bolt and threw the door open, to find her sitting on the bed, alone, exactly as she was before I entered the bathroom. She asked if I was okay and I said I was, but the whole thing left me feeling uneasy and I had a butterflies sensation in my stomach for twenty or so minutes afterwards. 

So, what do you think happened? Did my bathroom door accidentally bleed through the future, or some sort of parallel strand of reality, or was this just wishful thinking? I don't drink or do drugs and I am a rational, skeptical person, but I have literally no explanation for what I witnessed.

I tried so hard to convince myself otherwise, and just haven't ever been able to do it.

It was about 10 years ago, when I was 12 or so. I always had a thing about bridges. I would go through phases of being scared by them, and then love driving over them, and then switch back again. But even when I was scared of driving over a high bridge, I still loved looking down at all the cars driving underneath us. So one day at the George Bush turnpike in DFW, I was peering down at those cars below riding in the car with my mom, when I saw something I still can't explain. There was a convertible that immediately caught my attention, and there was nobody in the car. Not just no passengers of course, but no driver. I watched it for a few seconds before it passed out of sight, and there was absolutely nobody in the car. I told my mom, but of course she didn't believe me. Maybe y'all will.

I've had this dream (kind of) twice in my life;

The first was when I was between 8-10 years old 

In the dream, I was walking around in a swamp, with a group of friends. However, we were all in neopet form (kind of weird, idk lol). Anyway, we come to this bridge, and I was the only one with the correct body to get across it (even though i was a snake.. not very logical i guess). I'm walking across, but suddenly I fall through the bridge, my tail gets caught in a plank, but my head gets sucked into the swamp and I drown. Immediately afterwards, however, I find myself on the other side. I turn around, and I see my dead snake body in the middle of the bridge, and then I wake up.

That dream was always a little creepy, but I didn't really think that much about it.

However, last night, I had a dream where I was in the EXACT same setting. I cant describe it, but I had this feeling that everything was EXACTLY the same, down to the fallen logs etc. However, this time I am alone and I'm human. I get to the bridge, and I cross it without problems, jumping over the gap. When I get to the other side though, I suddenly have a feeling of semi - lucidity, and I KNOW I shouldn't turn around, but then I cant control it anymore and I turn anyway. In the previously empty bridge, I watch my Neopet-snake body fall through the gap and drown in the swamp.

I woke up very creeped out and ): 

**TL;DR: Dreamed I drowned as a snake, turned around and saw my dead body. 10ish years later, have the same dream as a human. Turned around and saw my snake body drown.. **

I was considering applying to it so I was participating in this event where you could ""shadow"" (go through an average day with) a TAMS student to see what it's like. I've always had a lot of trouble with insomnia. Especially in the days before something stressful is about to happen. (like, say, shadowing a TAMS student)

So basically I'm in the middle of the most boring math class I've ever been to in my life. I have no idea what the teacher/professor is talking about and I want nothing more than to find the softest patch of floor and visit the land of comatose hallucinations. I'm in the back of the class so I guess he might not notice if I just sort of rest my head on my hands and try to sleep that way. I knew he totally would, it was a small class, but I was tired and desperate. You have no idea what it's like to go for over 40 hours without sleep. (unless you actually do)

Anyway, someone nudges my desk and I nearly jump out of my skin from waking up so suddenly. The whole class looks at me like something's wrong and I turn red because I assume that everybody knows I was sleeping. After class, I talk to the guy I'm shadowing and apologize for falling asleep and he says something like ""when were you asleep?"" I assume he's just being nice so I talk about the class a little bit. I mention that I had no idea what the professor was talking about and my shadowee says that I seemed to have a fairly good idea if my notes are any indication. I don't remember taking notes, but I don't mention that to him.

During lunch, I get curious and look in my folder and notice that someone's notes are in it. They're in my handwriting and some of them are from parts of the class that I don't remember. So I try to ask my shadowee as calmly as possible what happened during that class. Here's his version:

I sit down, look bored, rest my head on my arms for a few seconds, and start taking notes. Then someone accidentally nudges my table while stretching and I jump a mile in the air and everybody turns around to see what's wrong. He also mentioned that I looked bored for the rest of the class.

Somedays seem to drag and others seem to scream by even though when you work I do--you do the same thing each day.  Some people will say that it all has to do with your perception of things, and although I think that is part of it, I have witnessed and been a part of time warps which cannot really be explained by our conventional definition of time.  This is one of them.

My friend and I went to college in a small town called Normal, Illinois.  My home town was a town about 45 minutes away from this town. On summer break, she had come to stay with me at my mom's house and being bored we decided to drive to our college town to check out what was happening.  She drank.  I didn't because I was the designated driver.  At 12:32, we started our trek back to my mom's house.  Mind you, I had driven this particular stretch of cornfield easily a hundred times and knew exactly how long it took to see my cities lights between the hills coming into town.  I knew the time because I had checked my watch (this was pre-having clocks in the car).  The cops were always out past a certain time, and I didn't want to be stopped with my friend passed out in the seat next to me.

So we get on the road, and that is when things got kind of weird.  Everything just started to go into slow motion and I kind of blacked out.  My friend kind of woke up and asked what was going on and that was all she remembers. It was really a weird sensation.  I thought that maybe I had been drugged, but it really didn't feel like any drug I had taken before (and I had done a lot of drugs in college).  

What seemed like seconds later, we both woke up.  We were both wide awake and driving into the outskirts of my home town. She was no longer drunk, and I was no longer moving in slow motion.  As we neared the bridge to get to my town she asked me what time it was, so I checked my watch and was shocked to find that It was 12:37. I have no idea what happened in that 45-to an hour stretch.  I have no idea or memory of how I drove home or how I managed to make a 45 minute drive a 5 minute drive.  The next day I tried to talk about it with my friend, but she refused--she said the incident had scared her.  I don't know what happened, but somehow we must have entered either a warp of time or a warp of space.  

On a lighter note, people say it is impossible to walk through a rainbow--it is supposed to be an illusion of the eye.  Well, the creators messed up one day and my husband and I drove through the red part of a rainbow.  

We were driving on the interstate, when we both saw a huge rainbow that seemed to end on the road in front of us.  We were surprised at how big the rainbow was and were even joking about going to look for the pot of gold because we could see the end of it.  That is when we hit it--the red ""beam"" for lack of a better word. Everything in the entire car was either red or pink and even the outside air had a pink glow.  We both were really shocked and just looked at each other.  Becaues we were on the interstate--we drove through it pretty quickly--it only took us about 5 seconds, but there was no imaging it --we had driven through the red part.  

Of course, what really shocked us was almost ramming into the end of the two cars in front of us on interstate that had come to screeching halt because they had driven through the red part, too.  Unfortunately, I can definitely say, there is no pot of gold at the end of those things.",,False,,t5_2tcwa,False,,,True,t3_wfj3q,http://www.reddit.com/r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix/comments/wfj3q/driving_home_one_night/,

I would go over my friend Carlos' house every week from when I was 15 to when I was 19 (2005-2009) and we would record an episode of a little podcast we used to make. Before we made that online show we used to record random videos of our adventures around his neighborhood, this comes into play later. 
So one day in 2009 after recording an episode we go outside to walk around, when I notice a lamp post about 5 or 6 feet tall oddly placed in the middle of his front lawn. I had never seen it before that. I asked him when his family had it put in and he gave me a strange look. ""It's always been there. Since we moved in."" I laughed and asked ""No seriously, when did that get there?"".	
He kept insisting it had been there every time I had come over before then. And also said he could prove it to me. He showed me an old video I recorded of him taking us on a tour around his house in 2005. And sure enough there was the lamppost. Granted it was only in it for a few frames and never directly mentioned in the video, it was still there. Even though I had watched that video probably 20 with him while he edited it and never saw it. Ever since then I can't help but feel eerie about it. I could not have been that oblivious for 4 years. Parallel reality? Randomly appearing object rewrites history to make up for it's sudden appearance? Glitch?

What I saw looked something like the fuselage of a large jet; it was shiny and looked like metal. But it was so large, it appeared to be hundreds of times the size of a 747. It was going straight down, totally perpendicular to the ground. It appeared to be going ""slowly,"" as large, faraway objects in motion seem to do. 

I was stunned and just watched this thing -- which had all the hallmarks of an actual object, its metal surface glinting in the bright sun, the air around it wavy with the massive heat it was putting off -- plunge downward into a bank of low clouds. I sat there, not moving, hardly breathing, waiting for it to emerge from the bottom of the cloud bank -- there would be a spectacular explosion! I was witnessing history! I was frozen in a kind of excited disbelief!

Although it entered the *top* of the cloud bank, it never reappeared out the bottom. I watched for a long time. I have never been able to make sense of what I saw.

Later that night, when I was home, I texted my aforementioned friend and told her I was thinking about mailing it back to the school, as I felt guilty. I realized, because the diamond was small and the carat was probably super fucking low, the ring wouldn't pawn for much anyway. She agreed and said, ""Okay, I'll give it back to you on Monday."" I was like, uh what? I have it. I said maybe she was confusing it for one of her own rings. She basically said ""I'm 16. Why the fuck would I have an engagement ring?"" 

I accused her of lying, of course, just playing a prank. But she sent a picture. It was the same fucking ring, slight bend and all.

And yes I'm sure I had it. I sent her a picture too.

Then I was looking for my mascara, which is amongst other make up items in a little white bowl. My mascara is a big fat black one from Rimmel and is the only black item in that bowl, the others are either lipsticks or lip liners of varying colours. What I am saying is that it is very easy to spot, it stands out like a sore thumb. 

So I look at this bowl and it isn't in there. I take out the lot in my hand like a deck of cards, fanning the items out and start fretting. ""Where the eff is my mascara?"", whilst looking around the bowl [lifting it up], looking behind the radiator, looking through the items yet again. All the while swearing like a fisherman as I was in a hurry and I won't go outside without it. This is where it gets slightly different from other ""missing but found again items"".
I am looking at the bowl again, scanning the area to the left of it, look back at the bowl and there it is, on top of the other items, unmissable. This happened so fast that it actually gave me a fright and I squeaked and jumped. Like when you do a double take and see something scary. One second there was nothing, the next it is there! That is why literally jumped.
WTF? I had things disappear and appear again before, but there were minutes or hours in between. In this case it was within a second. It almost made me physically sick. Also it wasn't an oversight by myself, remember that I had the lot in my hand and trust me when I say that this mascara is unmissable.

I was probably 15 or so. I had just got my braces tightened. After my orthodontist appointment I went ahead and went to the car to wait while my mom was talking inside. I was standing right next to this building when a lady in her 40's maybe and what looked to be her daughter walked past me to their car.

It's difficult to explain what my eyes saw. 

The story gets better. The lady is in shock just sitting there and her daughter helps her up. I should have* ran over to see if she was okay but I was bewildered to say the least. I just stood there watching them, trying to figure out what the hell I had just seen. The two got in there car and just sat there talking. Up to that point they must of forgotten about walking past me because after sitting in their car talking the young one looked at me and pointed. I of course turned around and went around the corner until they left. I was so shocked I couldn't even talk to them. I have kept this story a secret until today.

I have no explanation for what happened, and if it weren't for my sister being in the room at the time it happened, I probably would have checked myself into a mental institute by this point because it quite simply does not make any sense.

I was sitting on my couch using my computer, my sister was sitting 5 feet away on another couch. She notices a moth flying around the room, and being terrified of bugs, I offer to catch it and let it outside so she doesn't have to deal with it. Conveniently enough, the moth flies within my reach, and I snag it out of mid-air with my right hand.

As this is happening, my left hand is casually making a fist while rested in my lap, which I thought nothing of at the time. After catching the moth, I feel it flutter around in my right hand for a few brief moments, and then it stops. I assume at this point that I had either closed my hand too tightly, killing it, or it had just realized that it wasn't going to get out and stopped putting up a fight.

After shaking my hand slightly and still feeling no movement, I open my right hand and there is nothing there. Interesting, I think, it must have slipped out of my grip and I didn't notice. I then casually open my left hand which was rested in my lap, and lo-and-behold, the moth mysteriously flutters out. I instantly freak out and ask my sister if she saw what happened, to which she agreed that I had caught it with my right hand, but it had somehow moved to my left hand.

My right hand was never within a foot of my left hand while the whole incident took place over the course of 10 seconds or so, and if it weren't for her witnessing it, I would have thought I was crazy. I have no explanation for this other than a potential glitch in the matrix, quantum leaping, or some other phenomenon that I clearly do not understand.

Anyway, I realised there were some movies on the working WD HDD that I hadn't transferred onto my new one, so I thought I'd go about doing that. Once I found the box with the hard drives inside (which I hadn't touched in about a year), I noticed there somehow were now 3 inside. Weirdest thing is that the one that hadn't been there before acts exactly like the broken one, like when I plugged it in, it took about 5 minutes to register and then said it was corrupted. 

There are also two LG TV's in my house, one being about 7 years old and the other about 3. This also meant that they had different looking remotes. 

About 4 months ago, the remote for the newer one stopped working, so I started using the older remote on the newer TV.

I don't think it was super-natural, but it was strange enough that it has disturbed my understanding of reality in a very small, but definite way. Perhaps there's an answer to what I observed, and maybe the answer is stranger than anything I can imagine.  Here's what happened:

Around 1999 (when gas was $0.99 a gallon,) I would take the long drive from Glendale (AZ) to Tempe and visit friends quite often. At around 9:00PM my buddy Chris and I stopped to get gas at the corner station before heading out to the freeway. It was in June and the temperature was probably 90+F and the sun was down. We pulled into the spot, I opened my gas cap and started pumping gas.  I stoop approximately 4 feet from the pump and was standing close but not touching my car (a 1997 Mitsubishi Eclipse.) Chris was standing on my side (the driver’s side) and was about 4 feet from me. The place was very well lit, like most gas stations, and was self serve.  Chris and I were talking about something when…


Directly between us a “portal” opened up for 1 second, and then closed. I will describe it in the most detailed way I can. It was a thin line perhaps 1.5 feet long that had no perceptible width. It “sparkled” with an intensely bright white light, and was perfectly aligned vertically. The “sparkles” were strange, in that they were not flashes, nor where they electrical in behavior. The intensity was like viewing a laser in the dark, and dropping bits of glitter through the beam, except this laser was white, and the glitter was infinitely small. Another odd property of this “line” was that the bits of white light seemed to travel downward in one direction, and where they stopped in mid-air was very abrupt. There was no phasing in or out.  Imagine taking an exacto knife to reality… It started and stopped without any warning.


At first we both said, “HOLY SHIT DID YOU SEE THAT?” And before I allowed Chris to say anything else, my Skeptical Inquirer training set in. “What did you see?” I asked him. I wanted to hear him tell me the event without me biasing his perception of it.
“That white sparkle!”
“What did it look like?”
“It just started and stopped, like glitter or something.”
“Where was it?”


He pointed to the same place I witnessed it too. We spent a couple minutes searching the area. At first I looked above us, and we waved our hands around to see if there were any spider webs. I inspected the roof of the gas station, and saw a few moths but they were nearer the lamps about 20’ up than to us. The weather was clear, almost no humidity. Chris and I drove to Tempe talking about this thing the whole trip. I was surprised it happened at a gas station because if it were electrical it might have been dangerous, but Chris and I both agreed it looked nothing like electricity or anything else we had ever seen.


I have searched for an explanation, and still do every once in a while. I have ruled out St. Elmo's fire, ball lightening, fairies, etc. I’ve pondered if some kind of insect could produce something like this in a kind of web or such, but the intense light that came from the object is difficult to imagine. A laser beam seems to be the best idea, but a white one? And what would allow it to start and stop mid-air?

**TLDR: My buddy and I saw a portal to another dimension open and close at a gas station.**

My Grandfather passed away in February this year. He had no symptoms, nothing abnormal happening with his health, but just suddenly passed away. The cause of death was undetermined, but they said he had low BP, and his heart just stopped. Not exactly heart failure.

For the past few weeks before he passed away, he would do some unusual things. He wouldn't let my uncle (his son) leave his side. If my uncle was going out to do some grocery shopping, he would call his name and ask where he was going. He would tell him to relax and just chill with him (He wasnt bed ridden or anything. He'd just be eating and would tell his son to sit next to him while he ate). He would do this for his other children as well and would always keep wanting to chat with them. Keep in mind, there was nothing wrong with him at all. Maybe he just had a feeling inside of him telling him something was wrong in his body?

Now, due to our tradition and culture, after someone passes away, we groom and clean them before burying them (not sure if this is standard for everyone, but it is for our culture). He hadn't showered for a while because of a terrible foot injury he had where a lot of skin had been peeled deeply. The day before he passed away he decided to wrap his leg up shower, cut his nails, and got all nice and clean. 

He had also called everyone he knew a few days prior. Everyone that came to mourn him said we just recently talked to him over the phone, he called us. ",,False,,t5_2tcwa,False,,,True,t3_1iae55,http://www.reddit.com/r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix/comments/1iae55/its_like_he_predicted_it/,

I work at a law office basically filling out forms for clients. This means I have to go over very personal info (SS#, Mothers Maiden name, Spouse info, etc). I usually prepare my work for the next day right before I go home so I won't have to rush in the morning. Well yesterday I am getting my stuff ready and I stop at one clients name in particular. I KNEW I had helped him with his paperwork before. I thought it had been about 1 month or so since I had helped him before. I looked in his file on our computer system and only found one client with his name (its a bit of an unusual name too, not going to provide it for obvious security reasons). 

In fact, looking in his file it seemed he just recently became a client about 2 weeks ago and it showed I hadn't talked to him at all yet; employees are required put notes in the file when we speak with clients. So I thought, maybe he was a client before, so I checked our old file system and nothing. But I knew I had spoken with him, all the information in his file seemed like I'd seen it before. 

So then today happens and I am just lost. I KNOW I've filled out these forms with this man before. I knew his name, his address, phone number, what doctors he'd been to. Everything. Everything we went over I knew we were going to go over, because I know I did these forms with him about 1 month ago. And what really got me is when we got to his Wife's info and I actually knew her maiden name before he told me.

I've had deja vu moments before, but this, this seems different. I don't know what it was, but it freaked me out. Even just talking with him felt very uncomfortable, he was pleasant and didn't show any sign that he was reliving this interaction like I was.

So today my best friend came home from college for the summer.  He'd been having a rough time, just released from the hospital the day before because of a random infection that put him out pretty bad.

My best friend's girl friend doesn't have a working vehicle.  She didn't want to be stranded at his house because she had work the next morning.

So me and his girl friend arranged a surprise for him. I was the chauffeur for the evening so that she could visit him and have a ride back home to go to work in the morning, their long distance relationship had gone on too long and now that he was back and healthy I wanted them to have a good reunion.

**Account of the glitch**

So I'm chauffeuring my best friend's girl friend. Meet at her house, chatting with her sweet mother.  We are slightly rushed to leave to visit her boy friend/my best friend.  I reminded her to grab the cigarettes off the table, her mother points them out.  She picks them up and offers me one which I accepted.  She put the pack in her purse.  We rushed out the door with the pack on us. The table had no cigarette pack on it as I shut the door.

Later on that evening we are searching for the pack which is mysteriously missing in action.  Searched the whole car... Gone.

End of the evening:

Take his GF home and she walks in, runs back out and shows me the pack- it was just sitting on the table like we never touched it.  I couldn't confirm how many were left in the pack but the whole experience gave me the chills. Damn time glitching tobacco...

TL;DR: Smoking is bad for you. We left the house with our *only* pack of cigarettes. Smoked some, then the pack vanished in my car, when she returned home they oddly appear back on the table as if we never touched them.

Anyways, as I drove home I still had my windshield wipers running even though the rain had stopped hours before simply because occasionally a tree or something would get water on the windshield. This is when what I can only describe as a glitch happened. I was nearly home and I noticed that there was a line of water at the edge of where my wipers reached (completely normal) and every time the wiper reached that line and began moving in the opposite direction anywhere from 3 to 5 droplets of the water would be ""splashed"" back onto the windshield (still completely normal). However after this happened a few times immediately followed by the windshield wiper wiping up the droplets again, 3 droplets hit the windshield right in front of my eyes as I fixated on this cycle and when the wipers made their next round I realized the drops didn't go away, nor did they on the next oscillation. In disbelief as I drove I reached forward towards the drops which I had personally watched hit the outside of the windshield from a known source only to find the drops were now on the inside of the windshield.

1352502160.0,45,self.Glitch_in_the_Matrix,12xrv6,My first Memory. My second Memory. My zero Memory.,65,20,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix/comments/12xrv6/my_first_memory_my_second_memory_my_zero_memory/,"**Picture this:**
You are Nothing. Not nothing as in you dont exist. No, you exist, but you dont exist in this time-bounded 4 dimensional world we currently experience. I mean you exist, as an infinite and definite source of space where there are no bounds. You see, but not with your eyes. You hear, but not with your ears. You feel, but not with your heart or mind. You are what you are seeing , you are what you are hearing, you are what you are feeling. Picture this in the exact way i have told you. 


**Part 1:**

I was an entity. The earliest memory i remember, was me being a meager age of 1(ill explain a little later how i know i was 1). I am surrounded by family members, and i am next to a white wall. I see an older women, and i find a connection to her. I can trust her.  I open my arms, and say 'Ana' which is Me in Arabic. She lifts me up and picks me up to see over the wall next to me, and i see goats sheep and chickens. The moment this incident happened. It happens again. Exactly as it did the first time. The only explanation i have is that, because this was the first experience in my life when i am old enough to remember, I lived the memory back, because it was all i had. 

When i was 6 years old one day, the memory hit me again. I could remember and feel every feeling of that dream. Darkness, i was an being of entity that did not exist yet in this bounded 4-dimensional world. Then i am in a field with family and this scene happens TWICE. 


**Part 2:**

I am now 18 years old. I can recall that memory easily as being the earliest memory in my life. 
I asked my father one day if i had ever visited my grandparents back in Palestine (I am Palestinian). 
My father says to me: *'You were such an awkward kid. You were always a jumpy child. You could not sit down in a place. You had to be moving. You never knew where to go or what to do, but you could not stand being in one place at once. I am telling you this because, we have never seen you this silent and quite. You were only just starting to walk, around a year old, (Born in 1994, so 1995), and you would not leave your grandmothers side. Always asking to see the animals and always wanting to be in her arms. It reached the point you would want to spend more time with your grandmother than anyone else, including your mother.*

After confirming my first and second memory were real and happened, i needed to understand what was that 'darkness' i was before this memory. Only once did I ever see something that explained this 'darkness'. I was reading the Eragon(Inheritance) Series by Christopher Paolini. In his third book he writes about the Dragon Glaedr becoming an entity of pure energy in complete darkness after his death. The way he explained what exactly happened after the Dragon's death seemed something similar to me. So i attempted to find a way to contact him. I spent almost two months trying to get in contact, by calling him (there were like 6 phone numbers i repeatedly call), i emailed him, i sent him messages through his facebook and twitter. After two months, i finally got to talk to him. I needed to know how he was able to explain that feeling. That pure darkness of energy. After talking to him for 5 minutes about this, he told me, ""Keep remembering that first memory. Keep replaying it over and over and over and over. And focus alot on that beginning portion, that split millisecond of memory of darkness before the memory that always plays with the memory. Keep doing this until you fall asleep. (he mentions to do this before i sleep). Maybe something will trigger a previous memory. The Zero Memory......' The phone shuts. I have never been able to get in to contact with him in the last 6 months. That Zero Memory. I needed to know what it was. And so i did what he told me the following night. 


**Part 3:**

Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. 
With every repetition of the memory, i could feel it getting longer. The memory was growing details. The memory was getting stronger. I could feel every millisecond of this memory. You know how movies give you that feeling of being in the movie. Well imagine not being the actor, imagine being the entire movie. Not the director, the actual movie. You feel what everyone feels. You think what everyone thinks. You are everyone. I could feel myself reliving the same words, the same actions, the same feelings over and over. It was like re-watching a movie over and over, you know what happens, but the feelings and understanding gets better and stronger each time i replay. It was like reading a book. You are bound to have skipped or overread or overlooked something, and when you re-read it, you catch what you missed. 
Then I fell asleep. But When you sleep you wake up afterwards right? When you sleep, you dream, but you never remember the dream. Only fractions and the state of feelings it put you and left you in. I didn’t sleep. I didnt dream. I woke up. 

**Part 4:**

I’m in darkness. I lift up my hands, to see, but, they’re not there. It’s neither warm, nor cold. As I look around longer, I realize it’s not darkness I’m seeing, I am not seeing at all. The closest I can relate this feeling to, in our life, is like being a gas.  But I’m bounded. I’m held somewhere, kind of like a jar. Wait. The jar is containing me. Imagine being in a closed room, there are no lights, there’s nothing in this room, no physical concept at all. I can move freely as long as I want, I can go as high as I want, and I can move in any direction I want, but that only expands my jar. I have no memories in this room. I am not someone, I am not something, I am not anything at all. But there is only one thought in my mind. This one thought in my mind, I repeated over and over. Wherever I moved in my blanket and wall of nothing and darkness, this thought, was all I was. I found myself saying it out loud, but I didn’t have a mouth. It was like thinking out loud. But I can hear myself. I can feel myself taking it in all. So I stop everything. I remain in my position, and I concentrate on this one thought. ( I knew nothing of my surrounding, so I started from what I thought I knew). What was I thinking you want to know?  
“I can’t wait until it’s my time. I can’t wait until its my turn. Im gonna be the greatest ever, Im going to change everything. Once I get my chance, I’ll take it and make the best of it.”
This though repeats over and over. As I remained in my position, ( I cant say I was standing, because truth be told, I wasn’t standing nor flying. There was nothing, and I was there.)
And……then
Suddenly, white light emerges all around me. Everywhere. 

And I find myself, as a two year old, holding my arms out to my grandma above me, saying ‘ana, ana’ (Me, Me). 

**Part 5:**
 
My ears woke up before me. I found myself awake, yet I was in state of comatose. My ears have always been sensitive; I had extensive ear surgery as a young toddler for ear infection. I heard beeping noise, and instinctively realized I was in the hospital. Then my sense of touch pulled through and I could feel wires and the soft bed I was laying on. My sense of taste begins to tingle, as I realized I was breathing through a tube. Then the smell, It smelt like an old house.  Old people. That’s all I could think of. Then finally, my eyes awoke to light. It took time for me to recall my memories, my thoughts, and finally I remembered the zero memory. It hit me like a freight train. Suddenly I couldn’t breathe. I’m grasping for something, I’m struggling to stand up and run away. Something is not right. This is all not right. Why did I just recall an existence before my own? That could not have been true. It should not have been true. I should not have been able to remember that. The doctor in charge, so I assume as he spoke, screamed for something, and it all turned black. 

**Part 6:** 
They awoke me slowly. It was a lot to take in. Everything they told me. But here it is everyone. The previous night was March 15. The next morning that I woke up was April 25. My parents tried to wake me up for my morning class, but I wasn’t responding. I was alive the doctor said, but in an extremely deep state of comatose. They said my brain activity was a level that doesn’t happen. The only time they’ve seen this is an infant at birth that is trying to percept all the new notions of reality. The doctor said that while I was in my state, everything was off the charts. The prefrontal cortex showed my attention sensory systems were in use. The limbic system was showing that emotions were in high usage. The hippocampus, one of the parts of the brain, controls new memory was also in usage. However the doctors noticed there was a high neurotransmitter communications between the neurons in the hippocampus and the neurons in the Cerebral cortex. They found it frankly weird, and strange, almost as if I was remembering a dream that id previously forgotten. When he said that, that final statemnent, I closed my eyes, and cried. I don’t know why, but I just did. Everything we are, we as whatever an entity of existence we are, we exist. We are something. I don’t know what we are, I don’t know where we came from, I don’t know who is controlling this, but whoever ‘IT’ is, and I hope to someday meet ‘It’. I have so many questions, but the only thing I can do, is relive my zero memory. The only thing I can do is hope one day I can meet the one who’s behind the existence we live and are. 

**Edit:** Im at home, i got a night class to attend, so i am forced to have to postpone this for a few hours. 
If you are not interested in what i am writing, i do not blame you. This is a long post and may not seem to be a 'glitch in the matrix'. But thats only because i am yet to finish. I will finish the story very soon.

One day we were out snorkeling (without flippers) and we came across this large natural ""pool"". It's enclosed with a thick, rock wall all around (about four feet above sea level) and there's a hole below sea level through which the sea fills the inside of the pool.

So my friend convinces me that it's a good idea to hold my breath, dive 6-8 feet without fins, go through a ~2 foot wide, 3 foot thick hole and swim back up inside the pool to chill there. 

I dive right after him, see him go through the hole, no problems, and I go for it behind him. As he clears the hole, I try to go through but my snorkel pipe gets stuck in the jagged rocks, halfway inside the hole. What isn't helping me is the fact that, naturally, the sea is pushing me up, thus digging my snorkel pipe deeper. I try to struggle free but I can't... the hole is not wide enough for me to turn and push away enough to break the pipe free from the rocks and I'm struggling to keep my breath.

I can still remember thinking, *holy shit I'm going to die here*.

Then, just like that, I'm at the surface of the sea inside the pool. I'm not out of breath. I'm not panicking. My friend asks me why I took so long and I say ""no reason..."" but I don't know why I say it. I remember trying to remember how I'd got out, trying to remember breaking free and swimming up but coming up with nothing.

That's the strange thing really. It's not that I don't remember it... I don't remember many things. It's that I remember not remembering, even right then, myself getting out of that hole.

My mom developed lung cancer when I was beginning 5th grade. This, unrelatedly, was a time in my life when I liked terrible music. I read Baby Sitter's Club books and wore stirrup pants and looked like a girl who would love horses. My taste in music reflected all of this.

So, when Sophie B Hawkins' ""As I Lay Me Down"" came on the radio for the first time, I stayed tuned. I liked it. But, almost immediately, I got this horrible feeling about my mother when I heard the song. It was horrible, but strangely attractive. Basically, the song made me feel like her death was coming, but by the end of the song, I felt that her death was over, if that makes any sense.

You're probably heard the song far too many times in your life...but, if not, here:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcsHz_Tuor4

Over the next few months, I bought the CD -- my first CD after Ace of Base -- and listened to that damn song over and over. It was magnetic. I can't explain why. It made me both horribly sad and strangely happy. It didn't really have anything to do with the lyrics -- it was the tune.

Then, one day when I was in my parents' garage in the early summer, the song came on the radio. It struck me like a sharp knife: this song has something to do with my mother dying. I ran inside to check on her, but she was fine -- I mean, as fine as you can get when you have lung cancer and you're paralyzed from the chest down because of a giant metastatized tumor pressing against your spinal cord. She was watching television.

Then, about a month later, I woke up to my dad telling me that my mom wasn't feeling well, and they were going to take her to the hospital. He told me to pack a bag with a bathing suit so I could go swimming at my godmother's house.

I went downstairs to find a bunch of EMT's carrying my mother out of the house on a stretcher. She was hooked up to so many wires. The only words I could think of were ""Gee mom, it must stink to me hooked up to that many wires."" She just nodded and didn't really respond.

I spent the morning swimming at my godmother's inground pool while my dad hung out at the hospital. Around noon, my dad stopped by to see if I wanted to go visit my mom. I was having fun swimming, so naturally, I said not yet. My godmother said she'd take me over to the hospital later in the day, when I was all done swimming. My dad left and went back to the hospital.

Two hours later, and there I was, sitting on the couch reading The Indian in the Cupboard. The phone rings. My godmother answers. 

""Your mom isn't doing so well,"" she said, ""so let's go to the hospital.""

I was eleven. I didn't know the gravity of this kind of phone call. To me, it meant she wasn't feeling well. Maybe she was throwing up or something. Maybe I could cheer her up, you know?

We hop in the car and start driving to the hospital. The radio is on. 

We keep driving. We get into the highway.

And there it was: Sophie B Fucking Hawkins on the radio. The second that song started playing, I knew.

We got to the hospital where my father immediately told us that my mother had passed away only ten or fifteen minutes ago -- I never did the math, but that's basically when the song was playing.

Coincidence? Maybe. But that weird feeling in my gut the FIRST TIME I heard the song leads me to believe there's something bigger and precognitive here.

To this day, I almost throw up whenever it plays on the radio or randomly in a department store or something. Immediately, I call my father -- just in case -- to make sure he's okay.

**tl;dr The first time I heard ""As I Lay Me Down"" by Sophie B Hawkins, I knew it had something to do with my mother's impending death via lung cancer. A few months later, the song played on the radio in the car as we sped to the hospital where my mother was dying. We didn't make it there on time. She died within five minutes of the song playing on the radio...if not during.**

this happened about a year ago, and to this day, i have no idea what the hell happened.

if you were to see a birds eye view of the building i work in, it would look like a giant capital I. it is two stories, and at each end where basically the middle of the I meets the crossing lines there are lobbies with elevators. i work on the top floor a few yards away from the east end lobby and the cafeteria is on the bottom floor, also on the east end. on my morning break i usually go downstairs and refill my water bottle from the cafeteria, since it only takes a minute or so from my desk to the elevator then across the lobby to the cafeteria. 

at my work you have to keep track of when you log out for break, so you dont get in trouble for going over 15 minutes. i remember logging out at 11:48. i walked from my desk, which is a straight shot to the east end elevator, and pushed the button.

elevator door opens, i push 1, i hear the door ding, and the doors open. i walked out but as soon as i did, something was wrong.

i was at the bottom floor of the WEST end. i looked at my clock. 11:49. there is a good 200 yards distance from my desk to the west end elevators. i could not have possibly walked the opposite direction from the cafeteria and not realized it. no way i would have made it that far in 1 minute, including an elevator ride. in fact, the time it took me to walk from the west end to the east end to the cafeteria was 2 minutes. 

i was not sleep deprived or tired. i was not on any drugs or alcohol, as i dont do any drugs at all (random testing at work) and i do not drink excessively or on nights i have to work the next day.

i can't think of any other logical reasons this would happen. i know it isnt like i thought i saw 11:48 when i logged out and it was really 11:46 or 11:40 because i didn't get any incedent reports of taking a long break, and the next day when my stats loaded it shows i clocked out at 11:48.

We have finished eating and my friend had put his empty coke can in the empty glass from which he had drank the coke. The glass was large enough to hold the can but the can sat poking out of the top of the glass. There is a small steel ashtray sitting at the end of the table beside the wall. The kind that looks like a steel egg cup that has been widened and flattened.

We are talking to each other across the table when suddenly the ashtray moves across the table about 15 inches, away from the wall, in about a second. It didn't vibrate, or slow to a stop or glide. It moved like a person would move a chess piece for example. My friend and I are looking at each other in bewilderment and before we could speak, the glass with the coke can in it breaks and a big chunk of glass falls off it onto the table. At that moment a waitress is walking past our table and appears to trip on absolutely nothing and almost spills a tray of empty glasses on the floor.

This happened almost twenty years ago and I still cant think of a good explanation. The best I can come up with is sub sonic vibrations, perhaps from heavy traffic, which would have lowered the resistance between the ashtray and the table and caused the glass to crack. The glass cracked in a way that would have been consistent with the coke can expanding inside it and breaking it. But I cant explain how that would make a waitress trip. Perhaps that was a coincidence, or the waitress seen the ashtray move also and was distracted.

My mom and I have a weird connection. Maybe it's because I'm her firstborn, maybe it's because I live away from home, but she and I tend to know when something is up with the other. Bit of backstory: I'm a girl with very pale skin and very dark hair, and I get very self conscious about the teeny bit of upper lip hair I have. So Tuesday night I decide to attempt to nair my lip for the first time in my life. I do the deed around 2am. The next day, my mom IMs me, and mentions a weird dream she had about a woman nairing her lip, even though she has no hair there. My mother literally had a dream about what I was doing around when I was doing it. 

The second one is strange. My presence breaks electronics. Phones don't get reception around me, and I usually go through two phones a year due to harddrive failure. My laptop situation is even worse. Since June, I have had *seven laptops*. There is no known issue with the model I use, and there was no exterior damage to them. They all just crash. I don't download torrents or anything sketchy. I just have repeated hard drive failure. Light bulbs burn out around me. And I have never been able to use a remote and have it work.

* Vanishing/duplication glitches: Something disappears completely, or a copy of it appears nearby. May overlap with a time glitch if the disappearing object reappears later.
* Deleted memories: The ""everyone else forgot"" type of glitch, where you remember something very clearly, but no one else who was there does. May be a time glitch if the event repeats and is the same the second time.
* Alternate reality slippage: Someone/something is observed at a place where there is good evidence that it cannot be, doppelgangers, or facts suddenly changing. May be permanent. Could overlap with deleted memories.
* Teleportation: People/objects suddenly teleporting, obviously. May include a time glitch.
* Time glitches: Time jumps forward, backward, or freezes. 
* Electrical glitches: Things involving computers, phones, lights acting in an impossible manner, or without a power source.

I went to some kind of fair and saw a really long line for something in a tent that I couldn't see. I don't know why but I was drawn to this tent so I started walking to the back of the line. 

As I was walking by the front I saw this douchey guy( let's call him C) I knew from my senior year in high school. I'd moved the summer before my senior year and didn't have many friends. C was a total arrogant jerk who for some reason liked to make snarky comments about anything I said. When he sees me walking by he calls out to me and starts apologizing for the way he acted when we were in school. As I continued walking down the long line I passed one of my best friends (call him J) from high school (pre senior year). It had been a while since we talked so I hung out with him in line for a while catching up. After some time a couple people in line got angry and told me I had to go to the back. 

Finally I made it to the end of the line where 2 more people from my past were waiting. M was a girl I had known most of my life and had had a secret crush on since we had been kids (Call her M). M had gone to high school with me and J but she didn't know him. The other person was a guy I knew from junior high who I haven't seen or talked to in at least 6 years (we'll call him B). M, B and I hung out in line having a great time until we finally got to the front of the line which is where I woke up.

Now here's where it gets freaky. The day after I had the dream I got a message from C on Facebook (I have no idea why I was even friends with him). We start talking and he apologizes for the way he treated me in high school saying that he felt a little threatened by me because I was just as smart if not smarter than him in class. Then later that night I meet up with one of my coworkers to hang out. He says he's bringing his cousin with him. Turns out his cousin is J. We spend the night catching up and having a great time. By this point I'm feeling paranoid and freaked out but I keep telling myself it was just a weird coincidence. 

So then yesterday I log into Facebook and see I have a new friend request. Deep down I knew who it was gong to be but I still felt my heart sink when I see it's B. I've accepted his request but haven't talked to him yet. Finally I'm at the mall in GameStop preordering the PS4 when I feel a tap on my shoulder. When I turn around I see exactly the person I was expecting but it still surprised me to find myself face to face with M. I end up having lunch together and catch up. She's married now and has a kid.

Honestly I'm really freaked out by all of this and don't know what to think. 4 random people from my teenage years are in my dream and then within 2 days I interact with all of them.

Tonight, after locking the cage, I went to my room and came out about a half hour later to get a glass of water in the kitchen.

   At the time, I was about seven years old. I was playing Pokemon silver on my GBA. After a while, I had to go to my dad's house. Noticing that the battery was beginning to die,  I quickly dug through my cabinets to only find 2 AAs that weren't packaged (so I inferred they were already used). I ended up taking them anyway.
     Fast forward to about an hour later, it was time to put in new batteries. I toss the old ones in the trash and reach into my pocket. To my surprise, I pulled out 3 AAs. Suddenly something clicked in my head (I can't explain this thought, it just happened); ""If I put then back into my pocket, more will appear."" Sure enough, I put them all back and then reached in again, and their were now 4 batteries. I kept doing this until there were about 8 of them. After the 8th one, I decided to show my dad. When I tried it in front of him, nothing special happened. I just stood there with 8 AAs and a crazy story.
    One of the weirdest parts about this story for me is that the entire time this was happening, I was never surprised or shocked. I knew the batteries would keep appearing. When it stopped, I wasn't even mad or anything. ",,False,,t5_2tcwa,False,,,True,t3_1a0uap,http://www.reddit.com/r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix/comments/1a0uap/multiplying_batteries/,

I was on a backpacking trip in Yellowstone for 14 days with a camp. The trip had been going very well, no run ins with bears or injuries so far. It was on the 11th day, our group was having a lay-over day. We were camped right at the base of electric peak and we had planned to hike the peak that day. We got up early, had our breakfast, and began our hike.

We all decided to go off trail and bushwhack all the way up, no problem, we had some sketchy times on boulder fields, but overall it was very safe. Anyway, after a few hours we made it to the peak, unluckily right as we peaked it, we heard thunder. We were above tree line which is not a good place to be when a thunder storm passes. So we all hauled ass to get back down to tree line.

Finally at tree line we stopped for our lunch, ate all the food we had brought with us, and continued on. We slowly picked our way down the mountain, following a little creek all the way. Now it's important to note that we were planning on only being out for a day hike, big mistake. We were very unprepared, had no warm clothes, shorts and a light rain jacket all of us, no food, no light, no phone, nothing. After about 4 hours of wandering it was becoming pretty obvious we were lost, and the sun was starting to set.

Panic was setting in to some of the campers, rightfully so, we had no warm clothes and when the sun drops the temperatures can easily drop to freezing. nNeedless to say we didn't make it back to camp that night, we hiked in the pitch dark for hours, stupidly crossing freezing rivers before we all decided to settle down and camp it out. We found a little opening in the woods and huddled into a big glob, we dubbed it, ""The Cuddle Puddle"". It did drop to what felt like at least freezing, being wet from the waist down probably didn't help, all I know was that I was on the outside of the puddle and distinctly remember loosing all feeling in my lower half during that night. When the night finally did pass, we got up found a landmark we recognized and made it back to camp later that day, all very tired, very hungry, and very cold.

This is where it gets weird. When our trip was over and we made it back to Minnesota, I got a call from my mom. When I answered she yelled, ""Are you ok?!"", I was very confused to say the least, there was no way she could have known what happened, only the 6 of us on the trip knew, and we were 1000 miles away when it happened. As it turns out my mom had a vision, at 2 am. on august 22nd 2012, the exact same night we were lost. Her vision was me, laying in a small field, in the fetal position, shivering, wet, and wide awake. She said it wasn't even a dream, she had woken up in the night, and while fully awake saw her vision, and it really scared her. She had envisioned our circumstances in real time 1000 miles away.",,False,,t5_2tcwa,False,,,True,t3_15qo7v,http://www.reddit.com/r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix/comments/15qo7v/a_vision_1000_miles_away/,

 Sorry for the waits... My internet is still down.

 Anyway, I finally decided my mom should know what has been going on so I told her what happened. Well, I asked her if she could check her credit card history, and she agreed. Obviously this can be done online, so I had to wait for her to do it at her job.

 According to her history, she did not rent out a car for thanksgiving. So, by the record, we stayed in town. Also, to answer a previous question, my mom's car is a POS that could barely make a 2 hour drive, let alone a 6-8 hour trip. So for that reason, we usually rent a car whenever situations call for long road trips. 

 I have been a bit busy lately, so soon I will post any pictures I find, and the location it was taken.

One last question I can answer: My mom usually forgets a lot of things in the car. Having ""returned"" from a trip, there were two possible cars she could have left the thing she asked me to get (since the car did not have to be returned until much later in the week).",,False,,t5_2tcwa,1354743952.0,,,True,t3_14ceuy,http://www.reddit.com/r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix/comments/14ceuy/findings/,

We lived in Venezuela during that time, my parents in a city near the Colombian border and I in a big industrial city in the middle of the country called Valencia, some four hundred miles away. 

It was overall a great experience but Financially it was a tough time for me, my parents didn't have that much money even though I had a government issued scholarship sometimes I barely had enough to make ends meet.

One time we had to meet each other and attend a reunion in Caracas - the capital city of the country - precisely to fix some issue that had to do with my scholarship. The office building was located in a neighborhood called La Urbina, at the easternmost part of the city. I knew that once I got to Caracas I would have to make a long subway ride and then to catch a bus to get the place I was going. 

I went early in the morning to the bus station and realized once I was there that I didn't have enough money to get to Caracas and then to move inside the city. I got on the bus thinking about what my options were and how to communicate with my parents - we're talking about a time when almost no one had cellphones. After the bus rode off the fare collector started going seat by seat systematically charging every passenger. 

I held the money in my hand for him to see. The guy charged the two passengers in front of me and the guy beside me and then he simply ignored me, even when I said out loud ""here's your money"". The collector went on to do his job in the rows behind me and I quietly put the bill back in my pocket thinking there had to be a reason for that. 

I still was afraid that maybe the would realize their mistake and charge me later but it didn't happen... Eventually I met my parents in front of the appointed building some hours later.

Thinking back, I should've been freaking out, but I just shrugged it off and connected it. What makes it weird is that we were *slowly* disconnected, not suddenly, as you would expect if someone were to disconnect the cable.

story 2 :
When i was around 4 my family was sitting around the dinner table, eating a slice of fruit cake each, our familys camcorder was sitting on the table, and to turn it on you had to flick a switch, which made a loud click, so were eating our cake, and out of nowhere, the switch flicks on, and the record button is pressed , it starts recording us. at this point we are creeped the fuck out. then, it stops recording, and turns off. 

Story 3:

one day my dad was driving his car with his friend in a new area of town, they drove past a block of land with nothing but overgrown grass on it, and in the middle was a strange looking telephone box. he then noticed there was a extremely small man standing with the phone against his ear, not talking, just staring at dad. at this point dad slows car down and tells his friend to look at the man, they look at him for a few seconds before he just vanishes. he sais they were extremely creeped out, and drove home.
a few years later he went into a bar with my mother and he sais he saw the man in the corner, sipping his beer and staring at my father before vanishing.

As a Canadian pre-teen, I was into all the cool shows they had on YTV, but was particularly excited for one that was being announced called [15/Love](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15/Love). It either wasn't out, or only the first episode had aired then (this was, Sept 6 according to wiki), but I guess I'd been thinking about it because I had a dream about two of the characters. In my dream, the two (who were a couple on the show), got in a big accident. The biggest detail I remember of it was seeing a girl kneeling/crawling on the bloody floor of a car, obviously a pretty traumatic nightmare. I thought nothing of it. It wasn't until about two months later when they killed these two characters off the show (in an airplane crash), that I realized the two actors had actually [died](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaclyn_Linetsky) weeks earlier (September 8th). In a car crash. On the way to the set. 

This is when I know for sure I told my friend about it, because it freaked me out so much, and because of our disscussion is why I remember so clearly that the dream happened before the characters were taken off the show. 

Glitched up memory? Maybe. but I'm almost 100% that this is the way the events unfolded, because it's something I've thought about a lot since then.

So after lying down, I tried to relax and visualize everything the guy was telling me, and it felt forced at first.  Then I remember seeing trees and a stream as I was rushing to the station in the train.  In fact, I focused on the water and how clean and clear it was before arriving at the train station.  I specifically remember that when I was focusing on the water, I was outside the train.  After getting out and stepping onto the platform, I kept following his directions.  When he told me to look at the date, I saw two numbers: a 15 and an 1802.  When he said to look at my name, No month, though.  I couldn't read it, but I know it started with a ""T"".

When I came to the door to open it, it was strange, because at first the door was wood and lined with gold, but then turned into a black door with very ornate carvings of creatures I had never seen before.

That's when I went through it (it took a lot longer than what he was going through) and I ended up in a valley.  There were cliffs, it was green and there was a waterfall with more crisp, pure water and more trees all around.  Then when he told me to see what my job was, I was a stonemason.  The clothes I had on, though I never saw my hands or any part of my body, were what appeared to be some sort of large, loose-fitting robe-like garment with thick gold trim along the hem of the garment.  I saw that I had somehow ended up in a large stone building with a vaulted ceiling.  The stone was grey, but it had what appeared to be moss and vines on the stones.  After that, I pretty much let go and went much deeper.  I noticed I didn't have a body.  I realized this because I couldn't see myself when he had told me to look at myself in a mirror when I was back at the station.  I remember thinking that perhaps this was a place that was before time.

The next thing I remember is hearing part 2 of the session a second time, and that's when I realized that something was odd.  This time, though, I saw myself in the mirror.  I looked like an Italian guy with a mustache and curly hair that kind of stuck out like a fro, but not quite that big.  I don't remember a date this time, though, nor a name.

I went to a different place this time.

This time, it looked like I had gone into the future.  I started off in yet another valley, yet this one had very strange hexagonal rock formations that went up into the air at least two stories.  There was also a formation that looked similar to pride rock, but at a much steeper angle and not on the side of a mountain.

Then I was walking around a city that looked as if it was of an advanced civilization that lived in harmony with nature.  Everything was thin and sleek, but the structure of the buildings themselves were different.  I remember yellow being a dominant color, as if it was a different kind of stone, or like there was a dust storm going on.

Then as I moved into part 3, I was supposed to go back to the door so I could go to the train station but instead left the city another way.  I flew upward, and then backwards, head-first down either a cliff or a well of some kind.  I was weightless and just sort of floating/flying there.

I never went back through the door.  I also remember that I was alone throughout the entire experience.  There was not a single person I saw outside of me (and even then, the only time I saw myself with a physical body was in the mirror: I didn't see my physical body when I looked at myself.)  In fact, I stayed in the darkness until his voice stopped and I realized I was so relaxed I couldn't open my eyes and it was hard to move, as if I was waking up out of REM sleep or something.  I opened my eyes, looked at my girlfriend and asked her how long it had been since I started it.

She said 30 minutes.

Keep in mind I had been through this thing twice.  When I calculated it out, going through it twice was about 49 minutes.  There's no way that's possible.  There's no way that went through it twice in 30 minutes.  I would have had to travel time or something, and I KNOW that's not possible.  Am I crazy, or did I really just experience some sort of glitch?

When I was between the ages of 6-8 I had to undergo a series of throat surgeries and as a consequence was in and out of the hospital quite often. After my last surgery, I awoke in the hospital ward overcome with an intense feeling of self awareness. As I mentioned I was only around 8 years of age at the time, so this feeling was certainly something new. I knew it was something unusual and scary, and I'll try and describe it as best I can.

I was silent but loud, my thoughts were clearly audible and as I would look around at my surroundings everything I saw was being broken down descriptively. The more intense this feeling became the 'slower' things became, it was as if the physical world around me was at half speed whilst my mind was working at double speed. I became enveloped in a feeling of slow motion; I use enveloped because I felt that I [my mind] was working at its full potential, within what had become a thick soup of a physical world. Nurses walked by clearly slower than normal, my mind was almost waiting for more to happen for it to absorb. This lasted for around 2 to 3 minutes. 

As I grew older I put the experience down to by brain coming off of the anaesthetic after surgery, however the vividness of the experience always made me doubt this idea. I thought I would never really have another feeling like it, until I was around 20 years of age (I'm 25 now)

This time I was at university in the computer labs one night with a large group of course mates working on our projects, and out of nowhere it kicked in, the same feelings, the same envelopment within a thickening time, the taking in of information at break neck speed the physical world slowly going about its business whilst I observed its beauty then the gradual release back into normalcy. No one seemed to notice me acting any differently, I just have no idea what it was. 

This time is ceased to be scary.

FYI I've had psych evaluations for job related reasons so it turns out I'm not crazy, which was a relief.

I know it all sounds bizarre and probably unclear, it's quite a difficult experience to put into words. Has anyone else ever experienced anything like this? Would be great to hear other descriptions.

A rather mundane watch, it was the sort of watch a child wears. It had a plastic band, false glass to protect the face and clear numbers for each hour. I would wear this watch all day, with the exception of when I showered, at which time I would hang it in the bathroom on the towel rack. I would even sleep with the watch on. One weekend I woke up without it. I thought it strange that the watch I never removed had in fact been removed, so I looked around the room for it expecting to have had a dream that lead me to remove it for whatever reason.

I look to my desk where my alarm rests and lo and behold, my watch, sitting on the wristband between 2 books which had previously rested together. The face was pointed towards my bed and the 12th hour point to the ceiling. Now this probably doesn't sound very glitchy so I'll break it down. 

1: I never take it off.
2: I search my room
3: I use my desk hours a day when I'm at home
4: The watch was between 2 books that were previously supporting each other

I go to pick it up, and I see that it shows up as my good friend, I'll call him *Bob*, on the caller I.D.  So I pick up in a very familiar way, something like, ""What's up, Bob?!,"" and I hear the person on the other utter something, and hesitate.  I again tried to greet Bob, and the person says in an unidentifiable accent, ""No, this is not Bob,"" and at that point, I thought it was my other friend, Cody, playing a joke on me, since one of our things has always been to speak in bad accents.  So I say, ""Oh, this is Cody.  What's up, man?,"" and the person on the other line tells me that he thinks he has the wrong number, and I initially tried to convince him that I knew he was pranking me, but it dawned on me that Bob doesn't have the phone number that I have saved in my phone book anymore, and I haven't put his new number in yet.  So I'm a little weirded out, but I just let the guy go.  
Here's where the odds go up:  Bob had only recently moved back to South Dakota from Utah, and the number I have in my phone book is his Utah number, which he had for about a month after he moved.  Not only that, but there's no way the guy that called me could have Bob's old phone, because Bob still has it.  So what are the odds that some guy in Utah gets a new phone number, Bob's old number, and calls a wrong number in South Dakota, mine--two numbers that were previously associated?

So the routine every day was at the end of school was take public transportation back to my neighborhood if my family could not meet to pick me up.

One day in April, it was a nice sunny almost summer-like day, I left the school and noticed my parents were not waiting for me. That meant I had to cross the street and catch the bus home. It wasn't a big deal at the crosswalk I looked both ways and saw it clear and took a step off the curb.

**Now this is where it got weird!** 

I took a step off the curb I banged into what I could only describe as a force wall which prevented me from crossing. I could step back but I could not go forward. As I pondered why this was happening, a bright orange Ferrari drove by at about 90mph (140Kmph) through the school zone followed by a police car chasing him. Once they both passed, I was able to walk across the crosswalk.

Had I been able to walk across, I most certainly would have been hit by this speeding sports car.

If you have no idea what I'm talking about, here's my glitch: [""Do you want to go somewhere more private?"" A glitch in the matrix?](http://www.reddit.com/r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix/comments/1gvu8z/do_you_want_to_go_somewhere_more_private_a_glitch/)

I just got back from lunch with Bri, and I didn't want to throw this update in my previous post because of how long it already was with the edit. I'll jump right into things. 

Bri picked me up from work so we could have lunch together, we went to Panda express because it was close by, and she hadn't had it since she'd been back. We ordered our food, chatted about how our days had been so far, nothing serious yet about the party where all of this started, but she could tell something was biting at the back of my mind and simply asked, ""I know it's something Ryan, just tell me?"" I told her that I would once we finished our food and were back in the car, that I wanted to talk about it in private. We finished our food, refilled our drinks and once we were back in Brianna's car, I brought what happened up, but I was coy about it, and thanks to your suggestions I played things off as a dream I had. 

I told her that a few nights ago, I had a dream where I had seen her without a shirt on. She laughed about it and mentioned something like, ""Oh so you dream about me often I'm guessing?"" She seemed fine, and then I added the second part. I told her that I had seen a bunch of cuts covering her mid section and that it really worried and freaked me out. She looked at me, equally as concerned and assured me that she wasn't covered in cuts, and lifted up her shirt enough to show me her stomach and back, and even showed me that her arms were clean of any cuts or marks outside of a bruise she had when she banged her arm on the counter at Amanda's party that was about to fade away. This made me feel a lot better and I was sure this was the end of things. Bri drove me back to work, hugged me and thanked me even for being concerned about her, and kissed me on the cheek before I got out of her car. Here's something weird though.. 

I just got back to my cubicle at work, and I decided to text Amanda for the sake of checking with her about the sweatshirt, or if she remembers me and Bri coming up to her room last week at the party. Amanda said that she remembered seeing us go upstairs, but after that the last thing she remembered was seeing me rush downstairs in a panic looking for her. This confused the hell out of me.. I texted her back asking if she ever noticed Bri come downstairs without me, but she didn't recall. Amanda did however end up finding an orange puma sweatshirt up in her room that wasn't hers, and she hadn't gotten around to mentioning it to Bri yet, so she asked me to.

I'm sitting here at work, more confused than I was when I woke up this morning and I still don't know exactly what to think, if this is a glitch, I'm going crazy, or if that night I really did just drink too much.  Any additional suggestions on this would be great, thanks guys.

I distinctly remember this movie; it was Disney's Jungle 2 Jungle with Tim Allen. It was typical of a bad Disney 90's movie, just exactly what you'd expect. You had Tim Allen as a successful business dude and kind of douche, that one kid star from that one show, and a bunch of bad tropes about foreigners in America. We left, went to Fuddruckers for dinner, and then headed back to our hotel - fairly usual Dad weekend. 

About 6 months later, my Dad had me again for another weekend. We were going to eat one place or another and while in the car I noticed an advertisement for Jungle 2 Jungle, which was about to be released. I thought this perfectly odd since I had already seen the movie and could recall the plot really well. I mentioned this to my dad and asked how we had seen the movie so long before it had been released and he had no idea what I was talking about. 

I told him about the dad weekend from a few months prior, how we went to the movie, then Fuddruckers, then the hotel. He didn't recall it at all. He chalked it up to me being confused with the hundreds of other weekends, but when I started recalling the plot he became a bit more interested. I vividly remember sitting through the whole film, still trying to reconcile the fact the Tim Allen was NOT in fact Santa Clause, which at the time was my favorite Christmas movie. I remembered specific scenes and interactions, the characters names...everything. 

I've considered a few explanations:

1. I saw a preview and have a REALLY vivid imagination. The problem with this is that I clearly remember the afternoon, the whole movie, beginning, middle, and end. I'm sure my tiny brain could extrapolate a bigger story from the preview, but it seems unlikely.
2. My memory was playing tricks on me and I saw the movie much closer to the advertisement event than I had thought. This also assumes that the advertisement was out of date and it was just playing with my 7-yr old sense of time. This also assumes my dad just forgot we saw it (I'd want to forget too)
3. I am aware that this film is an adaptation of a French film *Un indien dans la ville* from a few years prior. To my knowledge I had never seen this, but it's plausible that I saw it which familiarized me with the plot, and then when I saw the preview of the Disney remake, I just super imposed Tim Allen and that kid from that show into the story. 


Dad thought it was confusing, but left it at that. I on the other hand have never been able to figure out how to control my time traveling ability and why I would use my awesome powers to watch shitty 90's movies with Tim Allen. 

TL;DR: I time traveled to the future with my Dad to see a shitty Tim Allen movie only to return to my own time with complete knowledge of the plot, months before the movie was released.

I was on a conference trip with a lot of other teenagers from my state.  The last night of the conference there was a huge formal-style banquet.  A few of the people I came up to the event with were sitting at my table. A girl sat to my right that I knew just from the trip and to her right a guy sat down that I had seen around the events, but didn't know personally.  The table was round and seated about 8 of us.  There was a large centerpiece of flowers.

We all wore these huge nametags during the week which pinned to our shirts.  They were a little smaller than a notecard and were inside of plastic covers.  When we would eat, we'd throw our nametags to the center of the table in front of us for some reason.  Anyway, when it was time to go we started grabbing our tags.  This is where it got glitchy!

The girl to my right had her right hand just in from the edge of her section of the table.  With her wrist staying near the table's edge, she raised her had at something like a 45 degree angle. I swear on everything holy that when she did that her nametag moved from near the center of the table in one quick motion directly into her hand.

WTF??!?!  I was stunned.  I looked at her and she just looked at me like I was going to say something.  I looked at the guy to her right and he said ""Did you just see that?  The nametag moved into her hand!""  I was stunned and said that I did.  He looked around at the other people at our table and asked if they saw it.  I asked others as well.  People thought that we were joking and left.  She chuckled and walked away.  He and I stood there, shocked at what we were certain we had just witnessed.

I had to ride back with her on the bus but I never mentioned it again.  Now I wish that I would have asked her about it in privacy, but I was a little scared of her.  To this day, I don't know what happened.

My fiance and I were driving back home after a family visit. As we are driving down the interstate, I notice a truck that has an empty horse trailer in from of us. In between our car and the horse trailer is a floating ball thing (looked similar to a large cat toy) The ball was a little larger than a tennis ball and had streamer things coming off of it. I point it out to my fiance and we figure its a horse toy of some sort with a 'invisible' string that got snagged in the door of the trailer. Except I keep watching it, and although it very slightly bobs up and down, it never goes side to side, it never gets any farther or closer to the trailer, and even when we slow down IT NEVER TOUCHES (or comes close to) THE GROUND. It stays in approximately the same spot gently floating in front of us for a good 45 mins  at least. This now has my complete attention as I can't figure out the trick. The trailer changes lanes, the ball thing goes with it in the same area. I keep watching. Then things get really weird- a sedan get behind the trailer for a while, almost parallel with us, then gets close to the trailer and signals to get in our lane. The sedan gets in front of us, and now the ball thing is behind the sedan! I look at the trailer and there is no longer a ball there! So this same ball is now somehow following this sedan, it the same height/floating pattern. We kept following for another hour before we hit a traffic snarl and lost what happened to the sedan/ball.

This was before smartphones and GPS, but while we probably could have figured out how to get back to the main highway pretty easily, we decided to stay lost for awhile just to see what would happen. 

What happened was, we saw our friend Mark standing on the side of the road hitchhiking. I vividly remember Mark suddenly standing there, wearing the ratty 90s poncho he always wore, his black backpack at his feet. 

Steve and I both looked at each other in amazement, and simultaneously shouted, ""That was Mark!"" We slowed down and drove a bit further, trying to decide what to do. It didn't make sense. Why would Mark be hitch hiking out here on this country road that we had never even heard of before tonight? It especially didn't make sense because we knew Mark was vacationing in Mexico at that time. Still, we were both certain it was Mark back there. We took turns describing details, and we agreed 100% that we had seen the same person, and that person was our friend Mark. 

We turned around and went back, but when we found the hitchhiker, he didn't look anything like Mark. He had short hair and was clean shaven, while Mark had long hair and a beard. He was wearing a baseball cap, while Mark never wore a cap in his life. He wasn't wearing a wool poncho, he was wearing a shiny red satin jacket. He didn't have a backpack or a bag of any kind. 

I suppose we should have picked him up just to see what the deal was, but truthfully, as he started jogging toward the car we got scared. Steve gunned the engine and we roared off. We quickly found the main highway and headed home. 

About a week later Mark returned from Mexico where he had been the whole time. We told him the story and he laughed at us, saying we were crazy.

It came from my grandmother who has since passed. She was never one to exaggerate and she never had problems with hallucinations. While she shared the glitch with my grandfather he died many years before I was born, so I never got his side of the story.

It was the early 1950's and she and my grandfather were traveling back home to Pennsylvania after having lived on a military base in California for a short while. They decided to take the sunbelt home and drove through most of the southwest. Eventually they hit New Mexico and were driving through a lonely corridor in the eastern part of the state, just shrubbery for miles. It's the summer so it's sweltering there, and they're booking it at about 80 mph. 

Then suddenly they see a figure on the side of the road, miles from any towns, just standing there unmoving. As they drive by they look at him and see a very dignified looking man in a white Panama suit, complete with a hat and everything. Both believe to be seeing a mirage, but my grandmother mentions it jokingly saying the long trip is making her crazy. Obviously my grandfather doesn't find this funny and says he saw the exact same man. They decide to be good samaritans and give him a lift, but when they turn around to look for him he is gone. In fact, they couldn't find a stalled car or any trace of him. This spooked them greatly and they quickly turned back and kept driving, trying to get out of the state. 

I often wonder if it was just Cold War paranoia that lead them to see what they saw that day, mixed with superstitions about bizarre sightings in that region of the world. Oddly enough, my grandmother never backed down on her beliefs, saying the man was indeed real, or at least it was a shared vision between both of them.

I spent most of my summer in 2002 staying at my grandmothers house. My father had just received custody of my brother and I. I had friends in her neighborhood and since it was the summer I hadn't been to school to make new friends in my fathers town.

My grandmother lived in a duplex, and the neighbors daughter was my age. On this particular night she was over and we were watching music videos. I'm not sure what time she left, but I picked up the book I was reading to relax before bed. I looked at the clock as one music video was ending. It was a little bit after 1. I decided I would finish the chapter I was reading and go to bed after that. A Linkin Park, who at the time, was my favorite band, music video came on. I finished my chapter before the music video ended. I got up to grab the remote from across the room as the next music video started and I noticed it was quarter of five. I thought that it had to be impossible, so I walked into the dining room to check the clock in there. Same thing. Kitchen? Same time. At this point I started freaking out because how could I lose such a large chunk of time? I am positive I did not fall asleep in this time.

It could be unrelated, but the next day the neighbors daughter told me she didn't remember going home and that she woke up in her bed confused because she could have sworn she stayed at my grandmothers. 

This is most likely a strange coincidence, but I figured it might be worth mentioning. Like I said, this event has stuck with me and it creeps into my mind every so often. In 2008 I was dating someone who was into theoretical physics. He was going to college about two hours away. He was coming home for the weekend, and something made me think about what had happened while I was waiting.

I'm unfamiliar with the station since we were out of town, but it was only playing contemporary pop hits by artists like Maroon 5 and LMFAO. 

Just a little backstory: For whatever reason, my friend (his name is josh) HATES the song ""Ain't No Sunshine"" by Bill Withers, released in 1979.

Anyway, just being a stupid kid, I said, ""Josh, just to make you mad, I'm gonna make Ain't No Sunshine come on next on the radio."" Naturally, we laughed, and didn't think much of it. Eventually the current song ended, and a new song came on. It wasnt Ain't No Sunshine, so Josh gave me a joking look and said, ""Nice try.""

Just as he finished his statement, the song that was playing randomly stopped. We heard static for a few seconds. Then, the static cuts off, and Ain't No Sunshine starts playing. I couldn't stop laughing.

I will summarize as much as possible, as this dream covered 15 years of a life I did not live.

The dream started when I was 5 years old. My family consisted of two strict, sober and quite often angry parents and six children (five older than I, two sisters and three brothers). We lived in an old, rotting, unpainted wood house on the outskirts of a small town. The house was large, but of such a shabby make that it was always cold and damp. Next to the house stood a forest that always seemed dead. As a child, I would explore it, wanting to get away from my intimidating older siblings and my scary parents.

I found a girl in the woods. She was silent, but about my age. I brought her home with me. My family ended up adopting her, despite our poverty and usual hostility. Her name was Shaunah, and she had a kind of mysterious air about her that interested me, even from my youth.

I got my driver's license and remember driving my dad's pickup truck into town, noticing how green and lively the forest bordering the road was. My oldest brother died in a car accident. I finished High School with poor grades and managed to get into a college. It was a small college, though, with one modern building.

I now have a second set of memories. It isn't nearly as filled out as my real memories, but... it's a second life. Every now and then, I feel homesick for the tiny town and I wonder how Shaunah is doing.

My family and I lived in a beautiful house in an Atlanta suburb while my sister and I attended high school.  At the end of a cul-de-sac and at the bottom of the hill, it was typical of that neighborhood - two stories, partially finished basement, large back deck and a medium-sized wooded lot out back.  My friends and I would spend most of the time in the basement as we could be loud, obnoxious teenagers and anyone in the bedrooms upstairs couldn't hear us.  The middle floor had an open floor plan expect for one smaller room, which we dubbed the piano room (as it, uh, had a piano in it).  This room was adjacent and viewable from the front porch, but we mostly had heavy curtains drawn.  Since my parents worked a lot, they were rarely home, sometimes for days at a stretch.

In the basement one afternoon, a friend and I were constructing something for a game we'd created when I realized I needed to make a Home Depot run.  So I did.  When I returned, my friend appeared shocked that I had new supplies.  She said she heard my mother and I fighting in the piano room.  She went up to the top of the stairs to listen, but not look, and said it was undeniably us.  After a few moments, the argument stopped, so she went about her business not to get involved.

Several other people left alone in the house had similar experiences.  And it was always noted as my mother and I.  I returned home once to find another friend pounding on the front door screaming for me.  When she saw my car pull up, she turned white as a sheet, saying she'd heard my mother and I talking in the piano room.  When she tried to peer through the curtains, she could make out silhouettes of two people.  No one was in the house at that time.  Freaked me out, too, considering the accounts from other friends (some of whom refused to believe in ""that sort of thing"").

Jump to a few weeks after graduating high school.  I'm sitting in my parents' bed (which I never did before), watching TV with my dog (who was always by my side).  I know I'm alone in the house as my mother and sister had gone to run some errands.  The phone rings and I pick it up.  What sounds like my mother's voice comes from the other end.

HER: What are you up to?
ME: Watching TV.
HER: Upstairs?
ME: Yeah.
HER: Good.  Come downstairs.  Dinner's ready.
ME: Are you home?

The line goes dead.  And my dog goes into full alert mode, which was odd for her as she was old and, well, an English Springer Spaniel.  She heads for the door, cautious.  I follow her because I don't want to be left alone.  We descend the stairs, round the corner to kitchen and there's no one there.  There is, however, a pan sitting on a burner on high heat.  My dog starts barking.  At this, my mom and sister come in to see me standing there, ashen.  They hadn't made any calls to the house or cooked anything before they left.

I've had a few strange ones---no nosleep shit, just weird glitchy moments---and have never felt comfortable sharing them. So yay for anonymity. 




Until I was 10, I was raised in Portland, Jamaica, a northern countryside parish. It goes without saying, I suppose, that it simply does not snow in Jamaica. In addition, I'd never had access to television until I was older, so I never even knew of the concept. 



This incident took place one day while I was at school when I was in the 2nd grade. It was lunchtime and a large group of my classmates and I were playing a game we called ""stucky"", which I think is a bit like freeze tag. The person who was ""it"" had just caught me and while I stood and waited for someone to come rescue me, I saw something strange. 



All around me, white, cold specs were falling. I thought at first that it was a sudden rain and was amazed because I'd never seen rain fall so softly or, y'know, be so white and cold. *It touched my skin*; I remember the soft, cold tap of it so distinctly. But I just thought it was a very strange rain. I was so amazed.


Then my friend's hand was on my arm, having come to rescue me in the game, and as quickly as that there was no ""strange rain"" anymore. I looked around me and it was as clear and dry as it had been before. I proceeded to ask everyone if they'd seen it. Everyone insisted they hadn't. When I persisted, they thought I was trying to trick them. No one saw a thing.



It wasn't until I was 11 and in the U.S. that I experienced snow for the first time. When the first drop hit me, it was like I was back in that moment.

One was red and one was blue. I didn't put them near each other to intentionally stare at each other or fight them. That's gross. I had pretty fish in nice size fishbowls. 
One morning I clean both the bowls out before work. I leave each fish in it's cleaned bowl on the counter near each other but next to each other. I was picking up stuff to put in the bowls after work so that's why I left them on the counter.
After a long day of work I come home and when I walk in the kitchen I look at the bowls on the counter and there is no red fish. Blue fish is chillin' and the red fish is gone.

I search all around the inside of the fishbowl, I look around the counter, the floor... The stove was about 4 feet away so I'm like, Did it flop out of the bowl and flop 4 feet along the counter and slide inside the stove through the top? Doesn't seem possible but I search the whole stove, behind the stove (can't see how it would've made it behind there but just in case) and pull the stove out and there is no fish. The counter the fish were on was against the wall so there was nothing to slide behind. There is literally no where for this fish to have gone. It's not in the other bowl. It didn't flip out of it's bowl and into the air and over into the blue fish's bowl. There is no skeleton or anything of him being eaten by blue fish.

The window of my city apartment is cracked a bit and not open wide enough for a bird to fly into the kitchen and onto the counter to scoop it out of the bowl and that is crazy also. I can't see a rodent coming in the window or out of the crevices to climb onto the counter and go into a bowl of water to get the red fish. The sink is not where the fish could get to without having to land on the floor first so he didn't slide in there and even if he did, the drain was covered with a protector thing that would stop him from sliding down the drain. No one had keys to my apartment including the super.
 I can literally think of no other (crazy) possibilities of what happened and I have tried to figure this from every angle over the years cause it's so weird to me.

I was 11 years old and went in fourth grade in a small school in Sweden, and my class had alot of kids with dyslexia (8 people, as compared to the 1-3 in the other classes). This meant that to give the rest of us a bigger understanding of what Dyslexia was like (at least that's what they told us, I understood when I got older that it's to save time and money giving them special reading lessons) we had the lessons with them.  The method they used was called Witting (probably the last name of the guy who invented this rather obvious method), and it's played out on a overhead. They put an overhead with a text of a story for all to see, but with real papers shadowing all the words. The teacher then reads one word at a time and we write it down, while she moves the papers so each new word is revealed so we can hear, read and write it at the same time. 

Anyways, on one of these lessons I ""heard"" the teacher say the first word twice, with about 1 or 2 seconds intervalbetween each other, meaning I started writing it down before she said it the second time. Well, the weird part is... She only said it once. After this first word I just ""knew"" or could accurately guess the next word, and I never got it wrong. Not even once! After about 5-7 minutes of this I started whispering the word out loud as I guessed it, and the people sitting next to me got scared. After a few more minutes of this my teacher noticed and got freaked out as the other kids told her about it. I stopped doing it, but I never really stopped ""guessing"". This whole time I felt strangely calm and content, but after the lesson I realized how fucking weird it was and got afraid.

Anyway, fast forward to a couple of weeks ago. I'm waiting at the same spot, waiting for a friend to meet me as we were going for a couple of beers. I see this guy out the corner of my eye and he grabs my attention. It's the same person - same clothes, same hat, everything. Then to top it all off he asks me for directions to the same hotel again.

Today in my English class, I was turning in a fairly large study guide for a book I was reading.  It had a fair amount of questions on each chapter and I had spent a large amount of my time at home to finish.  I gave the paper to my teacher to put into the large stack of study guides,  and sat back down.  About 2 minutes later my teacher calls my name.  As I'm getting up to walk towards her she gives me quite a puzzled look.

In her hands is a paper that has my name on it, but NOTHING else, no questions answered, just plain empty.  My teacher stared at it for quite a bit and I, being very confused at this situation, asked her what was wrong and how she got that paper.  She tells me that a few moments after I handed her the paper, she looked over on the ground, and saw a study guide with my name on it.  She immediately looked back on top of the pile, which she had just put my paper onto, but my paper was not there.

Obviously something happened here and it was not pretty.  I ended up being given another day to do the study guide because me and my teacher both knew something ""odd"" happened.

While I was playing my parents went out to do the weekly food shop and we had very recently had a new 40"" TV downstairs. So as nobody was in I thought it would be cool to play it on the huge TV. 

I specifically remember turning off the TV and N64 then turning them off at the socket - i had a sign my dad wrote on paper on the wall reminding me to turn things off. 

I unplugged the nintendo and took it downstairs and had a good hour or so playing it before my parents came back so i saved and turned off the n64 and started unplugging it to go back upstairs to play some more.

My dad went upstairs and shouted down that I had left my TV on 'again' and I said I was coming - I grabbed all the bits and went upstairs confused as to why my TV was on when I turned it off at the socket.
 
The TV was on and displaying static, I was quite freaked out because I definitely turned it off - but even weirder was that the TV was still playing the intro section (the logos and turok shooting an arrow at the turok logo) from the game, it was clearly visible in the static and was actually playing through and was not just a still image.

I showed my dad and he seemed a bit weirded out too as I had the n64 in my hand totally unplugged in the end we turned the tv off and went downstairs.

Has anyone else had something like this happen?

This happened to me when I was either 12 or 13 (I'm now 21) but I know I'll never forget this. I was eating dinner with my family at a seafood place. You know those places that give you plastic bibs with lobsters on them and the whole nine yards. They also give you wooden mallets with every place mat for a fun way to open your seafood dinner. Apparently (and I don't remember the reason why because it's irrelevant) I had pissed off my little brother enough that he took his mallet and beamed me with it as hard as he could in my arm. My entire body ceased up, my vision turned strange colors, and the room went black. Almost immediately following this I felt a floating sensation and a saw a large blank screen, like you'd seen in a movie theater. As my body floated in this pitch black theater-like room I realized the screen had suddenly turned on and was flickering a home move styled feature, except it wasn't some Hollywood blockbuster, it was my entire life being played on the screen before my very eyes. And I mean everything, birthdays sleep overs, the first time I road a bike. It was literally all there. If your thinking ""well that must have taken a long time to watch all that footage from all the years you had lived up until that moment"" your damn right. It literally felt like I was in this state for several years (at least). Each major stage of my life the movie screen would turn black and I would be left floating in the dark for what felt like hours and then suddenly adjacent to the one id just been watching would flicker to life  and under no control of my own I would float over it. This marked another, I guess we'll call it another, ""chapter"" of my life that was being showed to me. As I said this went on for what felt like two thirds of eternity but when it was finally over there was this strange tunnel with white light and I was dragged through it. On the other side was the restaurant and I was hovering over my dad crouching over something. Fast as the speed of light I felt my ""body"" zoom though my dad and into my ""real"" body and I opened my eyes. I was in a state of shock, not really able to understand why the hell i was laying on the floor and also because of the whole pre death experience. My dad then told me that I had fallen off my chair after slumping like a sack of potatoes onto the table. But there I was laying on the floor of the restaurant with all the patrons staring at me probably thinking I was mentally retarded for falling out of my chair and onto the dirty ground. Of course it was a bit embarrassing to have all those people staring at me but I was also so creeped out by the entire thing because what felt like an enormous amount of time had literally been no longer than the time it took for gravity to plop me on the ground from the distance of a normal sized chair.

How could only two minutes pass by when I listened to a seven minute song in its entirety?

I think the song I'm listening to AND the city I was listening to it in are somehow strangely connected, because weird ""I get places sooner than I really should"" moments have happened while listening to that song, but this was the only time I was able to ""see"" the weirdness by looking at the clock directly before and after.

Like many stories on here I have debated even coming forward with this one because I just can't seem to wrap my head around it.  
 
About two weeks ago I had this incredibly vivid dream, which is rare for me. Usually my dreams are short, and I wake up in the middle of them a lot once I know I am dreaming. About once or twice a year though, I have a pretty  vivid dream and I can usually remember most of them to this day. This particular dream takes place  in the past, maybe ten years ago or so at my grandparents house, where occasionally one side of my family congregates just to get together with everyone. I was hanging out outside in the late afternoon with my father and brother and we were playing catch with something, a football or something similar. I went inside to grab something to drink where maybe 8 or so of my other family members were hanging out. When I went inside I noticed a man sitting on the white leather couch in the living room, and I just stood there shocked. It was Wilson. He is my uncle. His appearance was so distinct in my dream, he had black work boots on, black denim pants, and a black Carhartt jacket. This was a peculiar look for my mom's side of the family, being so conservative and traditional, but for some reason this peculiarity was already known to me. I had remembered, in the dream, that Wilson dressed this way. Déjà vu in a dream?  
 
Now, big deal. I had a dream about my uncle Wilson. But I don't have an uncle Wilson. I have three uncles on that side of the family, none of whom are named Wilson or look anything like the man in my dream. Immediately after I woke up I had a flood of bizarre...memories? All of a sudden I felt like this man had existed in our family for some time, but hadn't shown up anywhere or been talked about for over a decade. At first I thought it was just lingering side effects from the dream, but throughout the last two weeks, memories began surfacing of other family activities where he was present. I remember him in places which never occurred in the dream I had. I can see him there, I remember what he was like, how he interacted with other family members, what he wore, etc. I have debated asking other members of my family about this but I fear if this is all just a fabrication of my unconscious they will think I have lost it.  
 
Other than that I have no real reason to have such a bizarre dream or psychological experience, I am otherwise a well adjusted member of society, I am not under a ton of stress, I haven't recently had a traumatic event, etc. etc.

My dad is one of those guys who can pretty much build anything so he recruited a few of his friends and they built our house by themselves. In order to fund this however, we had to sell our old house first so we didn't really have anywhere to live while the new house was being built. We lived with my grandparents for a few weeks but eventually we bought a really cheap and small trailer which we put on the edge of the farm. We lived in this trailer for about six months while the house was being built.

 After the house was done, we just left the trailer there since the property we now owned was around 50 acres and the trailer was far away from the house and was not an eyesore or anything, plus my dad was planning to eventually sell it anyways. Well a few years later when I was around 10-11 me and a friend decided to turn the trailer into a clubhouse where we could hang out. I had not been in the thing since we had moved into the house and to the best of my knowledge, nobody else in the house had done so either. When me and my buddy walked in to start cleaning it out, I was surprised at how well the place had held up over the years, especially my parents old room. While the rest of the apartment was beginning to become slightly dingy with age, their old room looked like no one had ever left it. The bed was still made with sheets that were clean, the desk in the corner still had a legal pad and pen still sitting on the table as if someone had recently been taking notes. I assumed that my parents had bought this furniture just for temporary purposes and had simply left it there when we moved into the new house. The thing that fascinated me the most however about this room were the walls.

The walls were covered almost floor to ceiling with pencil drawn art. Most of these pictures were of nude women while others were of other varieties, such as landscapes or your standard fruit bowls. My mother always liked to draw so I assumed that she had done this to pass the time while living in the cramped trailer with two toddlers while my dad was working. Well me and my buddy played some card games for a while in the room while ogling the pictures of the naked women and trying to commit as much of them to memory for future purposes, but had to leave around dark as the trailer no longer had electricity. 

Well the next day, a different friend came over and I wanted to show him our new clubhouse, so we walked back to the trailer and as I entered, I noticed immediately that something was different. The whole place seemed to have aged vastly since the previous day, and layers of dust that had not been there the day before now covered nearly every surface. When I opened the door to my parents old room, I stopped in shock. The room was completely bare. The bed that had been ready for someone to sleep in had been stripped to the frame. The desk was missing a leg and had fallen to the floor. And the walls...

I had just watched the movie 'The Men Who Stare at Goats' for the first time on dvd and the line at the beginning of the movie intrigued me.  It said ""More of this is true than you would believe.""

So I started researching remote viewing on the internet.  I even got a few books on the subject from the local library.  One of the consistent things I read from multiple sources was that the key to unlocking your mind's own intuitive abilities was to practice meditation with the intention to do so.  At first I was kind of scared to.  I mean, I didn't want to open Pandora's Box or get myself into something too intense without better understanding what I was doing first.

Some time passed and I just researched the subject from the sidelines without actively working to see what I might be capable of doing myself.  This changed when my 1.5 year old daughter at the time started having trouble sleeping.  She was acting like she was perceiving things or people that my wife and I were unaware of.  I had watched enough of the 'Ghost Hunters' television shows to wonder if I wasn't getting some warning signs that we had a visitor.

Now motivated by my parental desire to protect my child, the fear was surpassed and I decided that I would start meditating with the intention of becoming more aware.  It did not take long at all before I started having experiences of my own.

I had been meditating for maybe a week or two (every day after I would get home from work).  It was 23 August 2011 and I was walking to a neighboring building at work to go to a meeting.  I was in the lobby of my building and it was completely empty.  There were no other people there.  As I walked toward the main door suddenly in my mind's eye I saw everything around me violently shaking and I immediately thought 'earthquake!'  It was strong and abrupt.  It lasted maybe 5 seconds before I shook it off.  Although it was strong, I still knew that it was just a feeling or impression and not an actual earthquake.  All my physical 5 senses told me that everything was fine and nothing was shaking.  It was just a strong overwhelming feeling/impression.

I really didn't know what to think of it.  I sort of shook it off and walked outside and crossed the street to go into the building where my meeting was.  While I was in my meeting, near the end my boss who was sitting right next to me leaned over in his seat to show me his blackberry with the news that a 5.8 magnitude earthquake had just hit Washington DC.  My jaw about dropped and hit the floor.  The earthquake had just hit a few minutes prior and the feeling I had was almost an hour earlier.  We're in southwestern Ohio so we didn't feel any of it here.  

I had a few more smaller experiences after this that really validated some things to me but I didn't know what to do.  I really couldn't talk to anybody without them telling me I was crazy or at a minimum just looking at me with a blank stare not knowing what to say.  I actually did a web search in my area and found a meetup group for people to talk about psychic phenomenon and they did group meditations.  They really helped save my sanity because I found a group of people who were open and understanding in that subject area and even had experience to speak from.  

I actually ended up meeting a rather gifted individual there who was a trained medium.  I had him over for dinner to check out my house because of the sleep issues my daughter was having.  He ended up doing a clearing to help 3 visitors 'cross over.'  I was still new to this all and was becoming more open minded, but still healthily skeptical.  I have to admit that after his clearing that night the house definitely felt different and my 1.5 year old daughter slept much better that night and after.  It had been getting worse for weeks up until that point...  

Anyway, I wanted to share my story because it sort of fits in with the strange things people are reporting on this subreddit.  To each their own, but for those open minded to getting answers to things that just seem impossible to explain, you may want to try a daily meditation with a set intention on whatever it is you want to find out or experience.

I picked up my wife from work one afternoon. The parkway in the city where I lived was bustling with traffic since it was rush hour. 

We are waiting at a stoplight, and off to my right, a rusted old Ford pickup (from the 80s), its cargo area loaded to the top with what looked like an old wheelbarrow and tools of all sorts was passing all the stopped cars by driving up the roadside at about 20 mph. 

The light went green, and we passed the truck that had just passed us. An old grizzled man with long gray beard and large brimmed hat was driving hunched over the wheel. He looked as dirty as the rest of the vehicle. We pass him and get through the next light without stopping and after that we were able to speed up considerably. 

As we go through the next light (which was also green), I look to the rise ahead of us, and there was the truck we had passed, this time in the left lane and easily keeping up with traffic. There was no way that truck could have reentered traffic and pass us without me noticing it. It would have had to have driven a good eighty mph to do that, and the traffic was so thick that it would make that impossible.

No slider, buttons, nothing appeared on the screen to answer or even decline the call. It rang 9 times. Afterwards, I checked the literature and there was nothing about it having phone capabilities. There wasn't an option for a call log (obviously, since the thing wasn't a phone). We did write the number down, however, and when we called it, a man speaking what sounded like Russian answered, started yelling (well, his voice escalated) and hung up. 

She sent it back the following day (not because of the weird phone call but because the wifi radio sucked and if she moved more than ten feet away from her modem, she'd lose the signal).

She then bought herself a Samsung Galaxy tablet. No weird phone calls.

ETA for more Oddness: Just called her. She couldn't remember the name, either. She said she paid $149 (my memory sucks) on Amazon for it.

They were young and naive and didn't bring any food or water with them. After a few hours they realized they had somehow wandered off the trail and were lost. At this point a light rain was starting to fall and it was getting dark. 

Unsuccessfully trying to retrace their steps, and starting to get a bit concerned, out of nowhere they ran into an old man with a large, white dog. The man must have been in his 70s and the dog looked like a Husky but was pure white. They told the man they were lost and he gave them directions to get back to the main trail. He also warned them that it was going to rain soon.

The old man's instructions' were correct and my parents found themselves on the trail again. Now the rain was getting heavier, the sun was setting, and hiking down the mountain seemed much more difficult than going up. Since the gondolas were running from the top of the mountain and taking people back down, they decided to head to the top as it wasn't too far.

By the time they reached the top it was raining hard and the sun had set. There was no one in sight at the gondola station but it was still running. They got in the next gondola that arrived and made the journey to the bottom of the mountain. When they arrived the bottom gondola station was unoccupied as well. They got out on their own and left the building. 

Unfortunately, the gondola took them to the other side of the mountain from where they had started from. They were now miles away from their car, wet from the rain, and completely alone in the dark. After a few minutes of trying to figure out what to do (remember this was 35+ years ago), my Dad decided they should try and hitchhike even though up to this point no cars had come by the road they were near.

As soon as my Dad headed closer to the road a car appeared and immediately pulled over. Who was in the car? The old man and his big, white dog. Stunned, my parents hopped in, and the man drove them around the mountain and dropped them off at their car. To this day they talk about the old man and how improbably it was to run into him twice like that.

My friend and I laugh about it and how shitty it would be to end up in Charlotte, since I'm expecting a ride in Philly and he has a 5 hour drive ahead of him after we lakd.

Anyway, we forget about it and get on the plane.  Im stuck in the middle next to a baby which sucked, but is irrelevant to the story.  Never take the middle seat.  It is, however, important to note, at this time we both turned our cell phones to airplane mode, which disables all signals.

A couple hours later and we're coming into land.  The flight seemed quick, definitely faster than when we flew out.  It was also cloudy.

It takes a minute to pick up a signal again, and where does it show our location....smack dab in the middle of Charlotte, NC.

So were sitting there, in the back of the plane, with the shitty baby squirming around, waiting for everyone else to get their crap and move.  I pull up my phone and cant get a GPS signal at all.

Finally my GPS connects and tells us were in Philly, his updates too, and we look out the window and see the right city.

We had this weird older neighbour who would always talk about radom crap when he met us: things like a broken lightbulb in the basement, how smoking kills people, how bad the neighbourhood is, stuff like that.
So one time we were smoking some cigs, and this old neighbour walks down the stairs with a bag of garbage. He sees us, and asks:
„Do you know what was the single most important moment in Poland's history?”

„The Baptism of Poland.”
The old dude seems a little confused. „Yeah, that's right.” He says, goes on about how Christianity shaped our nation why it's important that we remember it.

My friends ask me: „Man, why did you say that? You're an atheist.”

I began thinking ""shoot B2, shoot B2"" over and over. A few seconds later, she goes for B2 and misses. Coincidence, obviously. Her turn came around again and I began thinking ""shoot C3, shoot C3"". She picked C3. I laughed.

""What's so funny?""

""I'm thinking coordinates to you and you're picking them,"" I said, jokingly, still assuming coincidence.

""That's cheating!"" she said, with actual annoyance.

I laughed again and considered my next move. ""J6,"" I said. She laughed.

""Now I'm doing it to you.""

We decided to set up a fresh game and deliberately think correct coordinates to each other. We then proceeded to play an entire game of Battleship with a grand total of three missed shots between the two of us.

And for those curious, at no point was it like I was hearing a voice in my head. I would just consider my next shot and take the first coordinates that popped to mind.

He had cool blue eyes, chestnut brown hair side parted, a long face, pointed nose, and a straight smile. He wore a red tie and a pale blue button down shirt and black pants. He was sitting, but I could tell he was quite tall. He looked as if he was just about ready to leave, as he smiled and let out a sigh of relief that the work day was over. I was about to approach him when he spun around in his chair and disappeared. The chair was still spinning and empty by time I was next to his desk. 

I don't know who he was, what company he worked for, what he was doing there, and if he was a hallucination. I can't explain how he disappeared. I'm pretty sure he wasn't a ghost as he was clear as day and I could hear him.

It was my senior year of high school. Every day I ate lunch with my close friends at the time. One of these friends has been my best friend for a long time, and is still my best friend today, we'll call him Pat.

One night, I had a strange dream that a traveling carnival had arrived in our town (a type of fair/carnival thing had recently passed set up near town if I recall, not really important to the story though). In the dream, I sent Pat a text message asking him if he thought the group would be interested in going. I ended up at the carnival later in the dream, but I'm not sure if my friends were with me at all. Pat never responded to the text message.

The next thing I remember is waking up and getting out of bed. As usual, I was in a dazed state as I'm not a morning person. I grabbed my phone and saw a message from Pat saying: ""Yeah, let's go."" I didn't understand it at first, so I just put the phone down and walked to the shower. It was when I was in the shower that I remembered the dream. As soon as I dried off, I went to check my phone. Nothing in the prior text conversation would have agreed with that response, and here was the really weird part: no date or time on the message. All I could see was that it was from Pat.

Of course I asked Pat about it as soon as I saw him that morning, and of course he knew nothing about it, just as confused and baffled as I was. There was no record of the message on his phone, and he claimed to have no knowledge of sending the message.

I have a few ideas about what happened. I'm always pretty skeptical, so I've always considered that Pat was playing a prank on me, as he has occasionally done in the past. But that wouldn't explain how we knew to send that message after a dream that he didn't have, or the lack of time or date on the message. I wonder if it was a message floating around from before that never successfully sent, but I know nothing about the technology of cellphones, and towers, and such (if anyone does know anything please chime in!).

I would love to believe that the Pat from my dream sent me a text message that made it out of my head, or maybe I made contact with another dimension or something, but that would be silly.

Anyways, that was just my personal glitch story. Thanks for reading!

TL;DR Had a dream, dream friend may or may not have sent me a text message through to reality.

I originally attributed this to an incident, which you can read about [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/SlenderMan/comments/zt8wd/i_have_some_free_time_so_here_is_a_true_story_yes/), because of the pattern the light follows. 

First it shuts off once I am within range, then it turns on as incandescent(yellow) then it slowly fades to white again and then at its brightest it shuts off again. **Repeat**. regardless of its original color.

I was once walking at night explaining the whole phenomenon to a new friend I'd made that very night. Im sure they would have thought I was crazy but before i could even finish the story *it happened*. I just pointed to the light and said ""see"". They were slightly blown away, and my close friends have noticed it too, well enough to agree with me. 

Update: /u/XxandrealphusxX has reminded me of the term ""confirmation bias"". This is something I have considered and unfortunately, ruled out. I study statistics and its too significant(common) to be considered coincedence anymore. so odd...

This is just plain weird.

I left this house four and a half years ago, but the two incidents occurred around a decade or so ago. It was a largish, five-bedroom house in North London. I shared with four other people, depending on the period, as others moved in or out while I was there. There were two separate incidents of a very similar nature which freaked me out at the time: I saw what appeared to be solid, living versions of a housemate's friend and my then girlfriend, while they were actually elsewhere in the house.

I've made a little floorplan to give you an idea of the layout, as it can be tricky to visualise: http://i46.tinypic.com/v8e7pf.jpg.

The first was Jen. She was, at the time, a lady in her forties. She was a tall, slim, Scottish lady, with short, dyed-auburn hair. She would often come over and in summer, my housemate, Marie, would often have barbecues in the garden. This was one such day. I had been outside, talking to them and eating, and returned to my room - front of the house, on the ground floor; what would once have been the living room - before heading back out to the garden. I walked out of my room as Marie was heading along the upstairs corridor to hers, and moved toward the rear of the house, past Andy's room, and stepped down into the kitchen. At the time, we had high cupboards above a large, perhaps 3ft wide window from the kitchen into a small living room, and a narrower passage through the door to get into the room. Next to this gap was Jen, reaching up to get something out of the communal, sliding-front cupboard. I physically squeezed past her and walked through the living room, out of the back door and... Jen was sitting at the garden table with one of our neighbours, in mid-conversation. There was no physical way she could have passed me to get to the garden from the kitchen, never mind doing so without me seeing her. It wasn't Marie, either - she was upstairs, had short, with dark hair and wearing an entirely different outfit.

Jen and Tony could see from my face that there was something wrong - and we were the only four in the house.

The other occasion was following a late trip to the cinema with my girlfriend at the time, Kate. We had a habit of going to see The Lord of the Rings on weekends, while Fellowship was still in the cinema. On one such night, we walked in and I immediately made for the upstairs bathroom, leaving Kate to walk into my room, immediately to the left of the hall, before the stairs. This was unusual for two reasons: we had a small, downstairs WC between Andy's room and the kitchen, opposite the understairs cupboard, after the step down; and because for some reason I didn't turn any lights on, which is strange as I hate the dark. Always have.

On this occasion, not only did I go upstairs to pee in the dark, I came back down in the dark, too. When I walked into my bedroom, expecting Kate to be there, she was not and the lights were still off. I went looking for her. I walked straight down the hall toward the back of the house, and saw her in the kitchen, in the dark - lit by the moon and streetlights, through a large external window above the sink. She turned away from the sink to the counter on the opposite wall, holding something as if she had picked up a glass of water. 

I started talking to her. And then within a pace or two, I reached the step before the WC and kitchen. I realised that she had gone and for a split second thought she was obscured by the edge of the door frame. But Kate was a stable hand and slim from physical work, but not four inches from front to back. There was no way she could have been hidden by the door frame and two inches of wall.

I called her name. Nothing. I called her name again. Nothing. I asked where she was. And then I heard her voice.

She was in the WC - obviously, with the door closed. The door that opened outwards into the hall, before the kitchen, so that she could not have moved from the kitchen into the WC without obstructing my view into the kitchen. And I saw her clearly, as real as I can see my housemate sitting in the chair across the room from me now.

Marie walked in the front door as I was calling Kate's name. She witnessed my genuine shock, as did Kate.

So, how in hell did they get from the places where I saw them to the places where they were?  All I can imagine is that it was a glitch in the matrix, of some kind. Perhaps some kind of micro timeslip? I have no rational explanation. These weren't corner-of-the-eye experiences. In one case, I physically touched the person and I struggle to put that down entirely to imagination.

A...thing...emerged from the wall just below the ceiling. Looking at it made my brain hurt. It was black, I guess, though it also seemed to have colours in it. It was like superimposed zigzags in high-speed flux. It was both jagged and fuzzy. It seemed more like a void or gap in things, than an object, as if it had either no dimensions or too many.

I was working a job as a janitor at an elementary school down the street from me to make some extra money. This was a very old school, built in 1926 and was certainly not in the best condition. I had to go sweep the classrooms/hallways and take out the trash everyday when school got out. 

There was one night that I was particularly busy so I decided to go the following morning to get my work done before the school opened. So its about 6 am and I am taking the trash out of one of the classrooms. As I'm standing in the hallway and I hear footsteps at the other end of the hallway. I turn and see a tall, blonde woman walking towards me with a small girl who I assume is her child. The woman must have been in her thirties and the little girl was about 8 or 9. The first thing I noticed was that they were dressed in these matching dress suits. They were light blue and looked like something out of the 1950s. I thought it was strange to see them dressed in such strange attire, especially a little girl (suit dresses are not exactly popular among todays youth). I called out ""I'm sorry ma'am but school won't be open for another hour"". Hand in hand, the two of them smiled and took a sharp left into the classroom they were walking by. I wasn't afraid but I was concerned with how they got into the building and what the hell they were doing here. So I made a b-line for the classroom and I found it empty. There are doors that connect each of the classrooms so I checked the surrounding rooms but couldn't find them at all. By this time I'm starting to get a little freaked out so I finished up my work as quickly as possible and got out of there. I didn't tell anybody about this because I thought it might have been in my head or I was going crazy.

This was already strange enough but this is where I really thought there was a glitch. About a month later I had to take some time off from work because I had to take a trip to Chicago for family. When I got back I was talking to the guy who covered for me. He was a morning person so he did all his work before school opened up. He told me that the strangest thing happened to him. He said that he saw a woman and a little girl walking down the hall in matching blue clothes and that they walked into a classroom. When he went to investigate, they were nowhere to be found. I hadn't told anybody about it and I was shocked to hear that the exact same thing happened to him. I then told him about my experience and we both got goosebumps.

I told about this new ""subreddit,"" Glitch_In_The_Matrix. I asked him if he ever experienced these ""glitches.""

He said ""not really."" I knew this was a lie, and I pressed him further. He cracked. Here's what he said has happened. 

Back in his younger years when he was a teenager, he would go to phone up his friends. As soon as he picked up the phone to dial, he would hear talking coming out of the speakers. 

Strangely, the talking was coming from the friend he was going to dial. They would have conversations. My Dad would ask if his friend had phoned. They said ""no."" 

So, my Dad didn't dial, and his friend didn't dial. Strange. This didn't happen with just one friend either, it happened with 3 different friends.

He said it also happened 2 to 3 times a week, for a couple of years.

I can't think of anything to explain this. Sysadmin of the Earth, you need to fix this; my Dad has noticed you!

The four most recent examples:

1. I live in a very large city (D.C.) and work downtown. I get passed by people everyday when I go out for cig breaks, but from the corner of my left eye I saw this man walking down the sidewalk and I had this eerie feeling that he was going to introduce himself to me and strike up a conversation, I even turned my face so that it wouldn't happen (mind you there's like 20 people walking by at the same time) But lo and behold he passes me, stops, turns around and says ""hi, I'm Chris! I see you out here all the time"" I was so freaked out by it I could barely say hi back, this is the first time I've seen him out and the first time somebody has ever approached me outside. 

2. I was on a plane and was able to accurately guess where the 10 people in front of me were going to sit WAY before they got even close to their seats, I just knew where they were going to stop.

3. I'm in the process of finding another job with a congressman after mine retired, my co-worker got luckier before me and announced she was hired at our happy hour to work for another congressman, my one co-worker asked ""which congressman?"" and I blurted out the name before she could answer. She looked at me astonished and asked how I knew? I didn't, and made up some excuse that she had mentioned it before (she never did). There are 435 of them and I don't even know all of their names.

4. Now, in an interview with another office, I was pretty excited that I may land this new job with a new congressman. I have never worked for his state before so I knew nothing about the district. But, during the interview I blurted out that it was the 33rd district in the state. There was no way I would've known that and my state didn't even go up to 10 districts so I could never fathom something that large. 

Weird. Explanation?

UPDATE: It happened again today, some guy walked into my office building looking confused, he had a small piece of paper in his hand as he walked into the elevator with me. I could tell he was lost and right as he turned to ask me ""Do you work in this building?""

Both of these happened when I was 16-17 y.o. 

1- I was headed into town with my best friend and right after we left my house, I remembered I left something (money maybe) at home so I turned around and went back. I left my friend in the car and my car running and ran in. When I got inside, the house phone was ringing. The caller ID said it was my cell phone. I had left it in the car and picked up and asked my friend what was up. She didn't say anything but I could hear someone there (faint breath and like the receiver pressed against skin). I kept asking her what she needed and eventually said I can't hear you but I will be back out in a sec. When I was heading back out to the car, I could see my friend looking wide-eyed at me from the passenger seat. I opened the door and laughed at her and asked her what she called about as I turned the car around and headed back toward town. She asked why I called her and didn't say anything. I asked her what she meant and she said I called and I didn't say anything but she could hear someone on the phone and it was really creepy. I told her I got a call that was the same thing. She said her call was from my cell phone too. I told her I had left my phone in the car (on a visor clip, I believe). She was shocked. She fumbled and showed me her received call in the history. I unclipped my phone and looked and there was no history of the calls at all. (which I understand could sound like she called and deleted it from the call history herself, but in the caller ID history and her cell phone history, the calls were done at the same time. I've known her since we were little and I know her mannerisms; her reaction was very sincere to me)

2- One of my friends had moved to a new house in an area I wasn't very familiar with. I went over and hung out for a while. As I left, I went straight on her road and dialed her to make sure I got back to the street I was familiar with to get back home. I was on her road heading 1 direction and I came to an intersection. It was wooded and had a small bridge off to one side and some houses ahead in the wooded area. My friend on the phone asked where I was and I told her I was on her road but I wasn't sure the road I was crossing (not sure if there wasn't a visible sign or if I just went through the intersection before I tried to look for a sign) and that I would tell her at the next intersection. The next intersection I hit was the same intersection. I was facing the same direction on the same road and hadn't made any turns. I told her what had happened and she just kept telling me there was no way and I had to have turned around and just forgot but I know that I drove straight on a road and hit the same intersection twice in a row.

and this 3rd one happened day before yesterday:

I was early birthday shopping at the mall with my S.O. and future mom-in-law. I had just bought new jewelry and was putting it on in front of a brightly lit mirror and my S.O. noticed that my new lip stud that I got about a week ago had already lost the gem.

I don't remember exactly where it is but I know it was within three blocks of the hotel we stayed at because I remember how long the walk back was. I couldn't find it.

Now this isn't too surprising. It was a few years later. It was a big town. Chances are very good that it went out of business and the space was taken over by something new. Or perhaps I misremembered the length of the walk. Annoying, but not a glitch.  Until what happened next.  

A few months later, I was in the same area of town and suddenly, spotted the restaurant. It was in the area I had looked through before and I had no explanation for how I missed it, but there it was. I went in and it was just like I remembered. Same decor. Same delicious ramen. When I left, I made sure to note where it was.  

About a week later, I went back and it wasn't there. I thought maybe I messed up the cross streets or something but no matter how much I searched the surrounding blocks, nothing was there. I never saw it again and moved away a year later.

she pulled out her camcorder and played something on it. it was a recording of me.

after that, the camcorder showed the paramedics laying my body down on a stretcher and telling my mom that i was dead, and she just looked down and started crying to herself.

the video was over, and i wasn't really scared or anything: i just took the lesson and decided that i wouldn't do it again. i asked her to show me more, and she said ""oh, that's it. see? the next thing on the camera is a picture of my living room...""

My mother has just recently passed away and I'm having a really hard time coping and coming to terms with it - especially due to the fact it was so sudden and unexpected (she didn't have anything like cancer or other such illnesses)

Christmas wasn't feeling the same at all but my family thought we'd do it anyway to try to make things as *normal* as they could be.

I was heading upstairs to my room to wrap my remaining presents when I felt what only I can describe as an echo (not even sure if this is the correct phrasing)

As I was climbing the stairs I could hear music that I specifically remember hearing a few years prior and also felt like my parents room (which is just a little further down the hallway from mine) was bustling with activity. I could hear the cutting of tape and wrapping of presents from that room too, adding to a *crescendo* of noise.

I felt such a strong sense that my mother was in her room, wrapping presents - I can't quite describe the feeling but I felt like I had climbed the stairs and gone to sit with her before and was now doing it again.

I immediately felt *at peace*, I didn't feel grief for what had happened and it genuinely felt that I had stepped back in time.
It was such a strong sense of *deja vu* that I checked my parents room at which point everything fell silent and time felt *real* again. I then felt an overwhelming sense of loss and grief and felt uneasy.

I wouldn't post it if I didn't think it was but if it's not I'll accept that and remove it. Anyway...

Almost four years ago in a short period of time a series of remarkable events changed my life. I cannot share my full story, but there is one thing that happened that I feel more comfortable posting about on here. Note, while I did experience some very strange things it must be taken into account that this also occurred within the context of mental illness. There were undeniably pathological elements at play here as well, I'm talking psychosis and temporary insanity. I'm fine now but I was not at the time of the initial sequence of events. I hope you can still read this with an open mind and come to your own conclusion instead of dismissing it out of hand.

So after the illness I voluntarily admitted myself to a psych ward. There I was put on medication and while still a  bit manic and confused, there was clearly a drastic improvement in my condition so when what I'm about to tell you about happened there were not really any other factors that could have clouded my judgement at least in relation to what I believe to be the significance of this particular event. I found myself talking by my bedside to a patient who I had become friendly with, let's call him X. I don't know how we got into it but he was sharing a story with me about a time in his life where he felt he was going to die. He had to go to hospital and rather curiously he was experiencing difficulty breathing, he told me he felt a terrible restriction in his breathing like he was being choked and felt he was about to die. Enter another person, let's call him Y. A few minutes after X told me this story and we had returned to the main area of the ward Y approached us clearly and visibly shaken. He wanted a word with us. There he explained that he could overhear our conversation, that he had been in the room at the time near his bed but his curtains were drawn so we didn't see him. At the time of X and I's conversation, Y, who suffers from chronic depression was attempting to strangle himself with a cord. He pulled down his jumper to us and showed us the cord mark around his neck. He claimed that he was passing in and out of consciousness, where he could hear X talking about a restriction of breathing and a feeling of being choked and when he was fading he found himself having a lucid experience where he was in a meadow, where a middle aged woman whom he did not recognize approached him and simply said ""not yet"". With his last bit of strength he grabbed the cord from around his neck and pulled it off him. This was Y's version of events and as I already said I saw the cord mark around his neck myself. I think this is a relevant story to share here but if I've overlooked some guideline I will remove it if necessary. If it's ok, then I'd love to hear you guys and girls perspective on it.

Now the other day there was a blowfly buzzing around the house, it had been in the house for hours and I was getting sick of it. When he finally landed somewhere that I could reach the only thing I had close to me was an empty glass Vegemite jar. So I caught that fly and put the lid on the jar with plans to release it in a few minutes once I had finished what I was doing (feeding the cat).

Those minutes turned into hours and the next day I remembered and went to see if he was still alive. I picked up the jar, and didn't see him. I turned the jar upside down so I could see if he was hiding at the top, but he wasn't. 

Now I was really confused, the jar was completely empty, there were definitely no holes of any kind in the jar, and the lid was not loose at all.

I put the jar down after my moment of confusion, and went to do something else. Yesterday I started thinking about the jar again and went back to check it, there was still no fly.

But at the bottom of the jar, right in the centre, was a little black ant, which was not there before.

When the house was finally complete, and we could move in, my husband had to leave overseas for business. 

My two boys, two dogs and myself were the only inhabitants. We had very little furniture and our large, 28"" tube television sat on the living room floor. My bedroom is situated directly above the living room. 

I awoke one night to the sound of the TV playing loudly. My dogs, crated puppies at the time, were awake and acting agitated. I walked to the banister outside my bedroom and looked down the stairway. I could clearly hear the TV and see the flicker of light it emitted in the otherwise dark house. I thought, immediately, that it was one of the boys. I crept to their room, they were both sleeping. 

I went back to my room, grabbed the puppies and the three of us walked downstairs. The cable box remote (the only one we use) was sitting, where it belonged, on a side table. I hit the volume button to first turn the TV down, it was at full volume. Then I turned it off.

It happened three more times in a week.

I finally flagged down the super overseeing construction and asked him about it. Since it was a new neighborhood, there were still a few phases to complete so these guys were always around. He mentioned some garage doors were being opened remotely since they were all on the same frequency but it wouldn't interfere with my TV. He thought a similar television in a nearby house w/a remote could be the culprit. Here's the thing, though: the houses are close but nowhere near close enough to warrant catching a signal like that and there is a road and a big park beyond that behind us. Also, I do have some creepy neighbors but who would be up @ 3am, blaring their TV at full volume? To this day, I simply cannot explain it.

I have to add, my first thought was that someone was in the house and accidentally hit the buttons on the front of the TV, since it was sitting on the floor. I'm not ruling it out but for the fact it happened a couple more times.

""Todorov defines the fantastic as being any event that happens in our world that seems to be supernatural. Upon the occurrence of the event, we must decide if the event was an illusion or whether it is real and has actually taken place.""

""Upon choosing whether the event was real or imaginary, Todorov says that we enter into the genres of uncanny and marvelous. In the fantastic uncanny, the event that occurs is actually an illusion of some sort. The 'laws of reality' remain intact and also provide a rational explanation for the fantastic event (dreams, drugs, illusions of the senses, madness, etc). In the fantastic marvelous, the supernatural event that occurs has actually taken place and therefore the 'laws of reality' have to be changed to explain the event.""

**TL;DR: glitches can be classified as either illusion or reality. If the former, it's called ""uncanny,"" we figure out the cause, and move on. In the case of the latter, the laws of physics must be changed to explain the glitch.**

It works.

I think it was probably at the younger end of that scale.

I was on the beach at Ocean City, MD with my family.  My brother, who is 18 months older than me, but much more athletic, was already able to get into the water and do what he wanted but I was not very confident because the waves were too strong for me.  This time, however, I wanted to follow my brother as far as I could and see what I was missing.  I walked out into the edge water, which was only inches deep, maybe to my ankles.  For some reason, I turned around.  Maybe it was to see my parents reaction.  They looked at me with strange looks, and then started waving.  I could see their mouths moving, but I couldn't hear them because of the sound of the waves.  This made me stop to try to figure out what they were saying.

You already know that they were trying to tell me a big wave was coming and to get out of the water.  But I didn't understand until the wave knocked me down.

It was probably not all that big a wave for a normal sized person, but it tumbled me and then dragged me out into deeper water.  There was apparently another wave close behind it, because when I tried to stand, I was knocked over again.  My head never got out of water.  I hadn't taken a deep breath so I was soon out of oxygen and my lungs started to hurt.  I probably made this worse by thrusting my legs and flailing.  I was trying to jump from the bottom so that I'd break the surface, but I was disoriented and never was standing up, so I just pushed myself along sideways.  Finally, my lungs couldn't take it anymore.  I knew it wasn't possible to breathe underwater but I couldn't stop myself from taking a big breath.  I felt like I was underwater, but somehow, I got air.

Then there is a blank spot.  At the time, I was so glad to have been able to breathe that I didn't linger on it, but there's a clear memory of a sharp intake of breath, then nothing, then I'm walking out of the water.

I know that I was pushing with my legs in the time before I took the breath, so it's possible that I broke the surface but the blankness is what concerns me.  If I passed out, how did I get up and walk out of the water?  I continued to be confused for a bit, while my parents berated me for not paying attention to the waves.  I didn't understand what had happened.  I didn't even know how to tell my parents about it, so I never did.

To this day I don't know what happened.  But it was the first in a long series of strange events in my life.

**EDIT TO ADD: Zoinks!  I just realized I had left out an important detail -- my mother said, ""We couldn't find you!"" when I came out.

It has been many many years since this incident so that detail may or may not be reliable, but I had it written down in an earlier rendition of the events and forgot about it this time.

I was so weirded out that I didn't ask what she meant.  I just remember that she looked at me funny.

I have a few experiences I would call ""glitches"" but I feel like talking about two of them.
Just for context, my mother passed away when I was in fifth grade.

1. 
I was in fourth grade and sleeping in bed with my mother and baby brother. Around 3 AM we all wake up for some reason. A few moments later, a bright white light flashes in the room, blinding me and enveloping the room as all I could see was white. It could not have been a car simply because cars don't produce that much nor that kind of light. I asked my mom what that was and she said calmly, ""That was God."" 
On another night before this event, the same people were in the same room. My baby brother had fallen asleep and my mom and I read a book together. All of a sudden, my baby brother started crying uncontrollably. When he cries hard, he would go through a crescendo process and reach his peak of banshee screams but not this time. It went straight from sleep to banshee screaming. I was very startled and scared. I asked my mom what was wrong and her answer was, ""The Reaper is here.""


2. 
I think I was either seventeen or eighteen. I'm twenty right now, so this is fairly a recent event. It's not creepy nor ghost related, but I don't know anyone else who has had this happen to them. I was walking home from school on a normal, sunny day. I reach the hill that my house is on. As I was walking up, it started raining. I wasn't carrying an umbrella so I started rushing home when I saw a mother pushing a baby stroller looking happy and dry in the sun. She didn't notice there was rain on my side. When I reached home and looked back, the pavement was all dry except for the path I had walked. It was almost as if I was literally getting rained on by a tiny cloud, like a cartoon. I go up to my room, dry myself up, and check the net if there was any chance of precipitation that day. All I got were 0% and no abnormalities.

A couple of weeks ago I was sitting in class listening to a teacher tell a story (he goes off on weird tangents that take up most of the period, it's awesome sometimes) and felt an unusual sensation. That is the best way I can describe it, a shiver went up my spine, all my muscles went slack, my eyes lost focus, and my brain kind of went empty. It ended in less than a second and I panicked internally, nobody else had noticed anything and I hadn't looked weird. I should mention now that my teacher was describing his time as an alcoholic, and had just said he hadn't touched alcohol in years.
The next day I was having an argument with my mother, and she made reference to some information that I hadn't told her about, and I became suspicious she had guessed my e-mail password and had looked though my inbox. She denied it, and I got that ""sensation"" so badly I almost fell over. This time I described the feeling as though there was some ultra high frequency noise I couldn't actually hear, but was affecting me for a split second, she just kinda looked at me funny. Later I looked on her personal computer, and not only had she been on my e-mail, but she had saved the password to her browser. (that's what I get for using the same password for everything)
This has happened several times over the past month, and every time it happens, someone has either fed me dubious information, or outright lied to me. 
It doesn't happen every time someone lies to me, but every time it happens, someone has lied. Oh and I never really figure out if my teacher was lying, bit it seems so. 
Anyone ever heard of something like this? Anyone know of any medical conditions that could cause these episodes? This post is already too long, but I should mention that I'm a highschooler who could probably be described as a jock, and I have never had an interest in the paranormal, and I don't drink or do drugs.

During the summer I made friends with another guy, Sam. He was from a town at the opposite end of the country and was there on vacation with his family. Sam would usually come over in the afternoons and we would play the games for a couple of hours. One game we really tried to beat was [Captain Commando](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_Commando). So went the days of the summer in my sleepy resort town.

One afternoon Sam came in, visibly shaken. He was sweaty and out of breath. He told me how he just woke up from the weirdest and most lucid dream. I was interested. In his dream we were playing Captain Commando and just after the all too familiar load screen we suddenly started falling through the darkness. Falling for a long time and being watched by eyes felt but unseen.

We ended up on a field where forces of evil, obviously, were fighting the forces of good. We took up our arms and joined the vicious battle on the side of the good. After what seems like hours of fighting, Sam wakes up gasping.

To be quite honest with you, I thought it was a cool dream, a good story. But Sam, he had the bewildered yet oddly vacant eyes of a man who just witnessed a car crash. If this was a performance, his commitment to the craft was worthy of at least a SAG award.

After a few minutes he was not amused that I was so matter of fact about the nature of nightmares, that they are lucid and can affect you for a while afterwards. As we were talking Mike showed up.

Mike's entrance was a welcome distraction. Soon enough we were talking about curls and push-ups and girls and bras. Mike, as was his custom, challenged Sam to wrestle arms. As they both positioned themselves squeezing each other's hands, Sam pulled his back in horror. He jumped up and shrieked: ""Look!""
He was pointing to a scar on the inside of his forearm, midway down from the elbow. It looked like the result of a non-sutured, fairly deep wound that was acquired a year or two ago. It was slightly raised, light pink in color, two inches wide and less than an inch tall, shaped sort of like an elongated diamond.

We looked at him, standing there holding out his arm, now breathing heavily. We touched and examined the scar and looked at him again;

""So""?

""This is where I was wounded in my dream""!

I would not do the same thing today, but I wasn't as wise when I was at that age. We harassed him mercilessly. We made fun of the situation a little longer and a little harsher than usual. Maybe there was an underlying and ignored element of fear in our humor, I can't remember. It was such a long time ago.

Sam finally stormed out, no longer willing to participate in our merry-making at his expense.

So the rest of the afternoon waned into the night and it was finally time for a cigarette before closing. Before I could take a drag, I saw Sam walking towards me very briskly through the stumbling crowd of people calling it a night. By the way he was walking, I half expected to be punched. He stopped short and shoved his arm in front of my face.

The scar was not there.

One of the rarest instances in my life where I was at a loss for an explanation.

Was wide awake, snacking, had watched about half an hour of the tape when another ad break started. I hit the fast forward button... as the program started up again, I pressed play. Nothing happened.

I looked around and under the couch, there were no stray batteries whatsoever (so that rules out the idea that maybe I fiddled with the remote and took them out absent-mindedly), and I knew I used that remote not only to fast forward through the previous ads but to rewind the tape before watching, seeing as the TV remote had no buttons for the VCR,  on top of this I had not touched the VCR in hours.

I was so nervous, as I was coming up from a tiny elementary school to a rather large junior high. My mom stuck me in girly clothes: a jean skirt, hot pink top, and a light pink watch with gemstones on it that she had gotten me the day before as a good luck charm. As I walked into my first period of the day, I was greeted with unfamiliar faces and sleepy preteens who wanted summer to cling on a few more days. The lesson droned on forever, and my teacher had us do the typical introductions and an beginner lesson. When the bell rang, I gathered my things and headed towards the door. However, I was stopped by a girl with long blonde hair and bright green eyes. ""Hey, I happened to notice we have the same watch!"" She said, putting her right wrist next to my left. ""My name's Jasmine! What's yours?"" I gave her my name, and later found out that aside from second period, I shared a schedule with her. 
We bonded quickly, and she soon became my best friend. Although neither of us were the superficial type (as fast as I could, I ditched the girly clothing), Jasmine and I would have days where we'd wear the watch together. Although this certainly wasn't the glue to our friendship, it was the thing that had made her come over to see me on that first day of 6th grade.
However, things changed in 7th. I had come home from swim team practice after a long day at school, and set my watch on the desk near my window. I went to eat dinner and take a shower, but came back to my room to find my watch missing. Now, even then I was meticulous about my room, so it didn't get lost in the mess. I also had taken care to always leave it in that spot because it couldn't fall or be overlooked easily. However, no amount of searching and looking produced my watch. Jasmine was sad about me losing it, but things (of course) continued as usual between us.
Fast forward to the summer before my junior year of high school. Jasmine broke it to me that she was moving across the country. I took it rather hard, but promised her that we would always stay in touch and remain close. The day she had to leave came a lot sooner than I had wanted. When I met her at the moving truck, I presented to her the letter I had written out that just had a few cutesy things on it. She presented me with a tiny box, wrapped in green tissue paper. I opened it to find her pink watch that we both had loved. I gave her one last hug, and headed home.
This is where things become... shall we say, glitchy. I walked into my room and flung my purse on the floor, entirely forgetting about the watch. I ran over to my desk, just to sit and think, when I noticed it. The pink watch, sitting in the spot where I had always put it. ""Huh"", I thought, ""I don't remember getting it out of my purse."" I picked it up to inspect it, and then realized something. It had my initials on the back. To make sure there was no mistake, like maybe we had somehow switched watches back in 6th grade and I had really lost hers, I ran to my purse, emptying the contents onto my bed.

I am 100% sure we were the only ones in the house on this day.

One weekend (circa 1996, which puts me at 15 years old) I was lying on the couch watching TV with the lounge room doors closed. There were two large panels of stained glass on our lounge room doors; so you could only vaguely see through them. I saw the figure of my Dad walk past the lounge room, open the front door to our house, and leave. I distinctly heard the sound of the front door opening and closing - it was one of those old-school heavy, wooden doors. 

I remember thinking: Well that's weird, he usually calls out to me before he leaves me alone in the house, even if it's just for five minutes. I was still pondering this when, not even 20 seconds later, I saw my Dad walk past in the exact same direction and THEN he called out, ""I'll be back in 10 minutes!"" and the front door opened and closed. I was wide awake, as I remember replying to him.

The first ""figure"" had looked and moved exactly like my Dad, but he would've had to go all the way around the back yard in order to walk past again, given the layout of my house. But there wasn't enough time between each incident. 

It didn't feel the same as some of the more creepy, paranormal experiences I've had, more like my brain did a weird little CD skip.

On week two I rode into a town called Takaka, where I found myself staying inside a Buddhist Monastery. About a mile down the road there was a local bar, where I went with some fellow travelers. When we arrived one of the guys immediately fell madly in love with this woman, like... still in the parking lot/not in the bar yet immediately.

Fast forward two days. I'm riding to the end of Golden Bay, which curves to an end. I wander out to the beach and I serendipitously run into this guy and this girl that had fallen madly in love. They invite me to stay at her house, which is on the same road as the local pub. I decide to take up their offer on my return journey.

I'll cut to the point. I arrive. We all start making dinner, it is me, a large Maori guy and the two lovers. We sit down. Start talking. Wine and food, all is well. They begin talking about their love for eachother. He says 'something', I do not recall it, but it sets something off. Suddenly, my vision becomes blurry, a voice begins to speak through me, a little different than my own normal voice, not just one of passion but as though from another person entirely. The thing is I was in observational brain noticing myself talking but unable to know just what I was saying. I snap back out.

The Maori guy turns to me and says, ""that was deep."" The lovers are quiet. She gets up and leaves briefly to smoke a cigarette. The guy (lover) is stunned.

We all stay the night and I find out in the morning that he (the lover) is moving on. I leave and continue on my journey south. Something I said in that moment changed the events, and so quickly, too. I felt bad at first, feeling as though I stopped his possible relationship. But I feel as though I saw something, was possessed, unable to recall what I said. 

Also, the memory of not knowing what I said occurred immediately after saying it. It was instantaneous.

I arrived home from work today and parked my car in the same spot I do every day. I checked my phone when I was parked, then turned my car off and got up to go inside my house. My mom was in the kitchen making toast. I can remember pretty vividly what she was wearing (red Ralph Lauren crew neck, dark denim, hair tied up), after stopping to do to the usual ""how was your day"" small talk I went upstairs to my bedroom. I opened the door and closed it behind me, intending to put some sweatpants on. Pretty normal, right?

This is what I don't understand...

I was in my room for maybe 2 minutes, when I went to grab my phone to make a call. I couldn't find it, so I assumed that I had left it in the car and proceeded to go back out to my car to grab my phone. I started heading down the stairs, where I passed my Mom carrying her toast... but she was wearing different clothes then she was when I spoke to her in the kitchen, a white Ralph Lauren v-neck with black shorts, hair down. I said ""Oh, when did you change? I didn't even hear you in your room"" (it's right beside mine.), she said ""Sweetie, I made you some toast, you seemed pretty upset when you walked past me, did I do anything wrong or did you just have a bad day? Also, your phone is just in your car in case you were looking for it"" 

What the actual fuck?

First off, was I completely imagining this outfit change? I was pretty coherent and did I even have that conversation in the kitchen with my mom? I remember it 100% also... how did she know my phone was in my car? did she know i was looking for it? there was no physical way for her to see into my car where i keep my phone without keys, and my keys were with me. My mother is a hardcore christian lady, so I see no reason she would go out of her way to mess with my mind like this.

I feel like I'm losing it.

edit 1: (to add additional information)

My mom had no memory of a conversation in the kitchen. She said I seemed upset when I got in the door and had just mumbled ""hi"" as I ran upstairs to my *room.
When I asked her about the phone, her answer ""Oh, that's strange I don't really know how I knew that""
... it's like there was dual glitches, she didn't find it nearly as odd as me. She also claimed that she was wearing the same outfit for the most part of the day, but did have denim jeans on in the morning and changed when it got warmer outside.

[Planck Length](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_length) is, according to really smart people (and not just crackpots, for once), the smallest measurable area in existence. Things that are a shorter distance apart than that? They occupy the same space. Literally, distance just stops existing at those levels.

From this we get [Planck Time](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_time), the amount of time it takes light (the fastest possible thing without time travel) to move one Planck length. And likewise, if the current equations hold up, time just stops existing at that interval. If two events happened less than a Planck time apart, they happened at the same time, literally, identically.

Now, Planck length is really small, and Planck time is likewise really short (there are a forty-four *digit* number of Planck times per second). But, logically, that shouldn't matter, they still shouldn't exist. And given the mind-boggling concept of infinity, there should be a literally infinite number of possible moments between them. But no.

These are dimensions of space and time below which the laws of physics just *stop*.

Does that remind you of anything? The pixels on a computer screen, perhaps, and the framerate of iterations?

On your monitor, things can't be less than one pixel apart, and no functions of any program with a visual readout can take less than a framerate (and even the processing functions happen in iterations, hence processor speeds). The screen compensates with anti-alias blurring and 29.97s flickering, but it's an optical illusion. Sure, things can move more than one pixel per frame, but if it's animated well enough, your brain doesn't notice it, just like your brain edits out [saccades](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saccade).

Now, the Matrix is obviously able to simulate astonishing amounts of detail, but no closed computation system can be infinite. Procedural generation perhaps, but not infinite. There would have to be, at some deep microscopic function, an iteration time, and a base unit of graphic readout. Below those specs, nothing could happen.

We were almost home, and had to drive by the Michigan Memorial Cemetery, it's the largest in Michigan.(probably irrelevant but idc). As we approach the intersection where the corner entrance of the cemetery is, we see a very old looking fire truck and a very old looking ambulance with their lights on filling both of the 2 driveways. There was also a man with his back against the center pillar between the 2 entrance gates(which were closed). Although it was dark out, we could see the man clearly because the ambulance and firetruck had there headlights on and pointed toward him. Mind you we only see one man, but nobody in the vehicles or anywhere else. After we pass this all, we kind of try to piece together what happened. We only drove for maybe 45 seconds before we turn around to check it out again. Alas, we go back and there is nothing. No truck, No ambulance, and no man, and there the man was standing at was now a decorative cornstalk thing. There were no other cars out to see it either.

I didn't exactly see this, but I heard it, and my friends saw it.

So it's lunchtime. Me and my buddies are chilling and eating. My friend, lets call him Brian, goes to the bathroom. After about 2 minutes I decide I have to go too. 

Let me lay out the bathroom real quick. Its basically a rectanle, a short hall-way type room with 2 sinks with mirrors, 5 urinals, and then 3 stalls, all on the right side of the room. 

So I walk in all of the way towards the stalls for a huge dookie, and the first stall is taken. No problem, that's Brian. Then I walk into the second stall, which smelled horrible, so I settled on the third. 

I'm in there doing my deed, and I hear the door open and close. Then i hear some stall doors opening and closing. Shortly after I hear Brian, and another friend, lets call him Ethan, discussing something sounding rather alarmed. I finish taking the deuce and join them. This is what they explained. 

Ethan entered the bathroom and proceeded to the stalls. First one taken, which was Brian, second one smelled like shit (he did actually go in and see that it was empty), and I was in the third. He then went back and checked his hair out in the mirror, so he would have seen anyone go by. Brian soon exited his stall, and joined Ethan, washing his hands. All of a sudden, one of the math teachers left the bathroom. He came FROM the direction of the stalls, and then left. From our combined accounts, he could not have been in there or have entered at anytime. He also would not have been in there long enough to do anything, even piss. He just LEFT. 

None of us have asked him about it, he probably would have no idea what we were talking about. Not too crazy, but we still have no clue what happened.


**Edit for clarity:** There are no other doors or windows in the bathroom. The tops of the stalls are also really low, so you would see someone who is above the stalls immediately as you walk in.

Lauderdale. I saw an ad in the paper that 1 800 Flowers was hiring drivers for the Valentine's Day holiday. I got the job. When I showed up they had a plain white van for me to use for the deliveries. People were gathering around the boss to get their assignments. They were talking about their familiarity with the area and other delivery jobs they had had. I was new to Ft. Lauderdale so I wasn't really familiar with any areas. I just took the bunch that was close to where I lived.    
    
I took my stack of index cards with addresses and my flowers and took off. My deliveries covered quite an area and knew I was going to need a map. I stopped at a gas station near where I lived and grabbed a book style map from the rack, then I headed to my apartment where I looked up the deliveries and got them in order. While getting my deliveries in order, I noticed that on one of the map pages there was an X that someone had drawn in on the map in pen. I thought that was weird, but didn't think too much of it. I took my delivery cards, now in order, and headed out.    
    
I went about the day making my deliveries. I was on my way to one delivery and was having a hard time finding a road that was on the map. I drove back and forth a couple of times looking for it, but all I saw was a roughly beaten down path/""road"" that looked like it was maybe used by a construction crew of some kind. I figured, ""screw it,"" and took the road. I drove in a ways and it turned to the right, which is the way I needed to go. After a while I was just riding on a grass ""road"" behind a row of houses. I'm thinking, ""what the hell?"" I stopped and looked at the map trying to figure out where I supposed to be. While I was stopped, I saw someone in their driveway. They were either leaving or arriving at their house. I don't quite remember. I got out of the van and started walking their way to ask for directions. I got to the man and told him I was delivering flowers and was pretty lost. I got out my map and showed him the address I was looking for. As I'm pointing at the map, I notice the X that I had noticed earlier. It seemed to be the exact location at which I was talking to this man. I thought that was pretty weird and I wondered what this guy might be thinking about some stranger parked out in his back yard in a plain white van, approaching him and apparently having his address marked on the map. Fortunately it wasn't awkward. He told me where I needed to go and I was on my way. I seem to experience a lot coincidences in my life, but that was definitely one of the most unique.

Smallish glitch I suppose, but its been bugging me since it happened a few weeks ago. My siblings and I were not allowed to have video game consoles while we were growing up, so I didn't have any games in my house until I got a Playstation 2 in high school. Fast forward to about a year ago when my gamer/hipster buddy laments breaking his Gameboy Color to me. I ended up buying him a replacement Color off of craigslist with some games. I played with it before I gave it to him and got stoked on playing awesome games that I never played as a kid. Anyways I ended up buying myself a Gameboy original off of Craigslist so I could play through the original Pokemon for the first time. Good times were had by all for a couple months until my Gameboy went into a box in storage for a little while.

This next part is boring and stupid but crucial to the story, and the only reason I don't dismiss this as a strange but passing occurrence. I replaced the heavily scratched screen of my Gameboy with an aftermarket replacement off of Ebay. The new screen had a darker bezel than the original and I left the screen protector on, but I distinctly remember keeping the original scratched screen and packing it away in the same box as the Gameboy.

After graduating and moving out of state for a new job, my parents shipped a couple of my stored boxes to me, packed as I had left them with all sorts of stuff, except for one thing. Where I had packed one Gameboy original and one replaced screen, there were two Gameboy originals, one with the aftermarket screen that I installed and one with a similarly scratched screen as the original. Perplexed, I called my parents and even my little brother who is in highschool and doesn't even like games. No one knows where the other came from. To this day the only game consoles in that house belonged to me. I even called my gamer buddy from before to confirm that I didn't just forget buying another.

I haven't ever gotten drunk or done anything that could explain me forgetting this extra Gameboy and have always had a fairly unusually good memory. Never had any problems with deja vu or any mental issues, just an average guy in most respects as far as I know. But now I have a pair of Gameboys when I only used to have one. So I guess if anyone wants a free Gameboy from an alternate dimension let me know, you get the scratched screen.

This was odd because the channel hadn't been pixelated or anything and the movie just ran so smoothly before and after the small cut. So I decided to rewind the movie and play it in slow motion around the time it cut in and out. When I got to when it cut, I saw one frame of the weirdest most random fucking thing ever. The picture was a live image of a native indian standing in the doorway of his house pushing the screen door out and talking to a white kid about 13 years old. I believe it was like a white house with a green door. It was like in Fight Club when Tyler Durden would switch one frame of a reel of film with a picture of a dick. But it wasn't dicks, it was an indian in a doorway talking to a boy. It was literally one frame and I must've starred at it for 5 minutes but I never took a picture and I am really regretting that. The frame is forever burned into mind. If I could print my thoughts I could show you all. The movie had nothing to do with indians btw, it was totally out of place, not the same setting, characters, nothing. So does anyone know what happened here?

I live with my dad and stepmom down in Oregon due to my Mother's alcoholism problems. Anyway, I was sitting at the computer chatting with some friends. From where I was sitting, I could see both entrances to the hallway: the one in the kitchen and the one right next to me. My mom's kitten was in the kitchen, I saw her walk into the hallway, she was calm. About 30 seconds later, she comes tearing out of the hallway, back arched and fur standing on end. She was either terrified or startled. I thought nothing of it, kittens sometimes do strange things.

About a minute later I heard a loud thud from the hallway. I go to look, and one of the lamp shades for the ceiling lamp has fallen to the floor. It was completely upside down from the position it would have been on the light fixture. Weirder still, it was glass and unbroken after an 8 foot fall from floor to ceiling. And the screws that held it in place on the fixture were still in place.

This is sort of what the lampshade looked like: http://www.lulusoso.com/upload/20120523/round_plastic_lamp_shade_sphere_lamp_shade.jpg

I was in the family room, where the stairs that lead to the upstairs are. My little brother was in our shared bedroom, which is down a hallway that is across from the stairs in the family room where I am.

Sorry if that was confusing, but the point is that my little brother would have had to pass me in order to get upstairs.

Anyway.. while I was playing, I my little brother calls my name, and says ""Come here! Look at this!"" as he laughs, like he wants to show me something funny. This is quite normal, so I was about to run back there, but then I felt a weird feeling in my gut. He called again, ""Look at this, I want to show you!"", and again I felt creeped out about going there. The thought of actually running to see what he was talking about seemed so normal, but I felt an overwhelming sense of fear and dread about going back there. I felt nauseated, and my stomach had the feeling that you get during a rollercoaster... this might be nerdy, but when I read the Harry Potter books, the way that dementors make people feel reminded me of the way I felt that day. I was so afraid that I just ran upstairs, where my little sisters and mom were.

As I get upstairs and begin to make my way to the kitchen, my little brother stands up and walks across the living room in from of me. Now, this is literally fifteen seconds after he called to me downstairs, and there is absolutely no way in hell for him to have gotten out of the basement *and past me* without me seeing. The stairs were still right behind me, and they are the only way out of the basement. I stared wide-eyed for a few seconds.. he looked as though he had been sitting/playing in the living room for a while.

I wonder what called out to me in the basement. Did I fall unconscious for some time after he called me? To my knowledge, I heard him call my name, felt scared, ran upstairs, and saw him up there. He didn't pay attention to me, as though he hadn't just called my name to come look at something. It wasn't like he called me from upstairs and I just heard ventriloquism, like it was coming from close by in our bedroom, but was actually coming from him upstairs.. he would have had to yell loudly for his voice to make it downstairs, but I heard him talking as though he was just in our bedroom.

Was it someone else? I only have one brother, and I know my own brother's voice.

Did he teleport upstairs? Why wasn't he surprised at his change of location?

Did I hallucinate his voice? If so, it is the only hallucination I have ever experienced.

This event left me feeling uneasy for quite a while. I still remember the feeling of dread in my stomach... I was 100% sure that something horrific and evil would happen to me if I went back to my room to see my brother, so I run upstairs instead and see him up there already.",,False,,t5_2tcwa,1374900938.0,,,True,t3_1j58bx,http://www.reddit.com/r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix/comments/1j58bx/my_brother_or_something/,

Im a little fuzzy on the details because I've tried to distance myself from the memory. It does contain things possibly caused by drugs but near the end there is a real Glitch I promise. Sorry if it's confusing Im just going to word vomit and hope it makes sense, It hardly makes sense to me still and I won't account every detail. Just the just of it :P

I used to work in a movie theatre and one night I had a horrible feeling of foreboding, and really didn't want to go into work (more than normal). Once there I had gone up to projection and took one hit of marijuana to calm down, I have never had adverse side effects from it before nor was there a chance it had been laced. At this point time became a muddled vortex. 

My account of what happened was I was mopping out the theatre when I started having that feeling of incredible dread again and I ran down the long hallway past the movie theatres, behind the staff area. The feeling that something horrible was catching up to me faster than I could run and I put my hand on a co-workers shoulder looked straight into his eyes and said to call 911. Then I felt myself twiddling my fingers and slowly walking up to concession, followed by the feeling of simoultainously being gripped by whatever feeling had been chasing me and the sensation of my heart exploding. To which I experienced astral projection for a split second before being thrown down to my body. My soulless body had made its way to the handicap ramp and as I ""entered"" it I had the sensation of falling backwards into rainbow static, again and again in an endless loop. It felt like eternity and hell rolled together. At this point I was convinced I was dead, and I was trying feverishly to grip onto the memory of being human, yet the memories were slipping away. 

After what I had deemed as my eternal punishment in the motion sick inducing spins, I entered a roller coaster that sped through the moments of my mortal life. Except the things I noticed weren't major life achievements but rather inconsequential things( such as a purple crayon on a desk in my kindergarden class). This went on for a while as well as the appearance of ""god-like"" men who kept trying to pull me from the roller coaster. It felt like they were trying to bring me to a place of knowledge and understanding. I don't know how I knew that but I did. A few other odd things and sensations happened and at the end I ended up waking in a hospital 3 days later. I felt hollow and distant from people for weeks. As if I and all this around us were just an illusion, a projection made from an over ruling entity that could manipulate time and substance around us. It took me a few weeks to feel ""settled"" in the human role again. Even know I can't think too much about it without feeling strange. 

Now that you have the backstory onto the glitch! After suppressing the embarrassment and confusion about the event, I asked my co-workers what happened that night. The co-worker I asked to call 911 confirmed that I had walked up to him and asked to call the police. Then proceeded to walk towards concession screamed and collapsed to the floor. They then carried me to the handicap ramp. Where paramedics arrived shortly thereafter. 

However one of my long time friends said she went to check on my mopping, since I had been gone a while, and found the mop next to an ajar theatre door. Where I was passed out in the empty room under the screen convulsing. She and the manager then lifted me to the handicap ramp to await paramedics. To which I would have had to imagine walking down the hallway and talking to my co-worker. Yet he is the one who called 911.

Needless to say I never worked there again and it's a small sketchy theatre, they have all manors of unexplainable things happen. I've no doubt been added to the circulating rumours used to amuse the new hires. I know a lot of it can be explained by the drugs, but it was one small hit of purely marijuana(I haven't done it since). The projectionist also took one hit from it and was fine. Any of your thoughts on what happened or similar experiences would be appreciated :)

A lot of people will tell you this is a memory problem however while Occam's razor dictates simplest is probably the obvious answer I disagree, these things stand out the most and I seem to be the only one to notice them...well someone else did one too with me.

Last July in 2012 we had new neighbors move in next door to where I live. They had a fairly big yard and prior to them moving in I would often walk through their yard as a small short cut across to another street.  One day while coming home I see a tree in their front yard, this tree  I swear I had never seen before. I walked through this spot and I think I would have seen a Large Tree ((GPS Cords for Google Maps -&gt; 39.986088,-76.832856 &lt;-)) I commented to my room mates that I noticed the neighbors planted a tree - they reacted with ""no thats been there"" I could swear it wasn't, I searched pictures I took, maps, and everything and yet there it was...as it had apparently always been. Except I walked through this yard in that spot and had NEVER ran into such a tree. Very disorienting to me but it was not the first time it had occurred.

Two years prior to that (2010 - late autumn) A good friend of mine and I had went walking through a placed called the Old Hawk Lake Golf Course which was since abandoned and turned into public walking trails. We took a path that went along side where a grocery store set just behind some trees; upon getting over a small hill we noticed a building sitting on the golf course, it turned out to be the club house. We went inside and it was just empty shelves, an open floor, and an old toilet. We joked about how people probably used the toilet still as it stank badly and I remarked how odd it was that the building was still standing, it was fairly large and had a parking lot for golf carts out front. We continued our walk and decided to come back but neither he nor I could find the building. Instead we found a concrete slab with broken glass everywhere, misc. junk, and a pipe about where the toilet would have been. And it looked like the building had been a really long while and would have taken a work crew at least a few days to clean up but when we had seen it at least 45min prior it was very much there. ((GPS Cords -&gt;  39.981629,-76.765099 &lt;-))  My friend and I do not talk much now a days but he remembers it and just likes to not talk about it.

I guess about 4 years ago in my junior year of high school, I went through quite a strange phenomenon. I was under the very distinct impression that my thoughts were creating reality----- I felt like I was able to influence seemingly random occurrences just by thinking about what result I wanted.

   I would get this weird feeling in my head and think something was going to happen, and it would. Dice rolling on the number i expected, street lights turning green the instant i wanted them to, a specific song coming on the radio... This happened for about 2 months straight. I never tried to apply it to larger scenarios, but I was dead certain i was influencing the outcomes of these seemingly meaningless events by my own thoughts. As a physics analogy, I would describe it as if my thoughts were collapsing wave functions of these given events into the outcome that I wanted. 

Again, not sure if this is the right place to post this and im not even sure what happened to me in that time period haha. Anyone ever experience anything like this?

It almost killed my brother, and put everyone in the car at serious risk. It was by far the worst day of my life, and I saw it happen the day before the event. 

One Friday my family and I were driving south for the weekend. Everything was fine for the first couple of hours, and we stopped in a small town. A few of us crossed the street to get food. Walking back to the car (which was in site), I stopped dead in my tracks. I saw it as clearly as if I was standing right in front of it; the car completely crushed at the front, the back doors wide open. The family car, totalled, smoke everywhere. The image vanished and I was back on the street, everything was normal. But I was deeply upset and shaken. I'd never experienced anything like it. I decided not to say anything, and I just got back in the car. That night we reached our destination safely.
The next day, we had been on a dive and were heading back to our cabin I'd been feeling uneasy about the drive all day (and my brother, who was almost killed, admitted he'd had the same feeling. So had my mother.. Around 5pm that afternoon (24 hours after my vision) we crashed head on into a small truck. I stumbled out of the car and ran across the road, then turned around to see what happened. I saw what I'd seen the day before: our car, crushed at the front, both back doors wide open, smoke everywhere. 
Everyone was ok eventually thought it was a close one, and a terrible accident. I've always been a reasonably spiritual and open minded person, but this still gets me thinking. I've not told many people about it. Sometimes I wonder if I could have prevented the accident.

I was near the end of highschool at the time. We were running late, as usual, so my mom was in a rush and we sped to church. Along our normal route, I noticed an old lady in a pretty bad part of town staring at our car and pointing at me. 

At the time I thought nothing of it, because the crazies in that section of town did things much more odd then that, so I tried to brush it off to the side but I couldn't quite forget this woman.

A few months later, my girlfriend and I have been fighting for awhile and I was going to the school to work out with the track team (which she was also on). I parked in the student lot and abruptly noticed that it was a lot more quiet than usual. When I started to walk to the door to go in the school, that fucking woman was staring at me from inside the school. 

Pretty spooked, I decided to go run a few laps before I went in the gym. I knew I was running late, but at the same time I knew that atleast my girlfriend and a few other people on the track team should had been in the gym. How did no one see her?

Fast forward a few years and I am in college. I got recruited to play football, which was my dream, and I was loving every second of the new experience. My girlfriend from highschool and I had moved on, and another girl that I was crushing on forever wanted to meet up with me. 

Long story short, we started dating and she came to my school every weekend to hang out and party. One weekend around Feb / March, we both wanted to go out and she let me choose wherever I wanted to go. She had a bunch of friends on campus from highschool, but both my frat and my friends were throwing parties that night and I decided that it would be a better idea to go to my buddies place.

On the walk over, we crossed a few streets and were about 100 yards away from his apartment complex when I saw the same lady again, outside of the bar near his apartment. This time I knew it couldn't be a coincidence, she was there for a reason, and she was looking right at us. Never moving, just staring.

I immediately faked like I got a text and said one of my frat brothers asked me where I was, and we should go over there instead. I asked my girlfriend if she saw ""that drunk older woman"" by the bar and she looked at me confused. She didn't see anyone that was not college aged or slightly older.

The day I saw this woman at my school, my girlfriend at the time was cheating on me with the only other person at the school, someone who I considered a good friend on the track team. The night I saw the woman at the bar, a stabbing happened at the party I was supposed to go to. One person died and multiple were injured, luckily I didn't know any of them personally.

I have been wondering what to think about these forever now, and reading through this subreddit enough I decided I should share my story. I think if I ever see this woman again I will attempt some form of contact instead of being scared shitless and walking away.

My parents had our house on the market for a long time. We were living in a townhouse and needed more space and wanted a big yard to install a pool. My mom worked PT at an elementary school and my dad was a middle school Geography teacher and coach for multiple sports (not the school I attended). 

We got an offer on our house and around the same time we found our dream home. It was a great home, very large for us and had a perfect backyard for a pool. It was a dream for us all! Except, I would have to attend a different HS than all my friends the following year.

Normally this would have worried me to the extreme. I was a notorious worrier, always anxious about something trivial or out of my control. My friends were upset I was going to be moving, even though it wasn't far, but I would be attending a rival HS. I was not concerned in the least.

I was completely positive I would never step foot in the house my family just bought, or attend that other school. 

The day before our house closed and we were closing on the house we bought, my dad died unexpectedly of a heart attack. He was 42. He didn't smoke or do drugs. He rarely drank. He was a little overweight, but in good health and active. He never had any health issues. It was a complete shock to everyone. 

Looking back I have to wonder if I had some sort of precognition of his death. I certainly never thought he would die, but I was absolutely certain we would nver move into that house and that I would go to the HS in mu district. 

Luckily, we were able to keep our current townhouse and the house we almost bought went back on the market and sold shortly after. ",,False,,t5_2tcwa,False,,,True,t3_1674nt,http://www.reddit.com/r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix/comments/1674nt/precognition/,

Data partially recovered.,39,3,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix/comments/ugo3k/system_restore_error_data_partially_recovered/,"Hey, so I just discovered this subreddit and I had to share my story! I'm sorry it's so long but I wanted to make sure I got all the details that I can remember. TL;DR is at the bottom.

Summer of 2011 I was on vacation with friends in Madrid, and brought a compact digital camera to take photos. One night, we decide to go out clubbing at Pacha, and a few of my friends volunteer to be the picture takers that night, so I put my camera, ipad, passport, and some cash in the hotel safe. After a bad experience with housekeeping in Rome, it has been a habit of mine to set up my macbook with the screen turned off, but recording video of the room (specifically the door and the closet where the safe is) for security in case anything goes missing. Fast forward to the next day, and I want to take my camera with me to the palace (and other touristy places) but it's not there. I got way too excited about knowing that I must have caught the perp on my macbook, and immediately opened it back up to check the video from the night before. 

Here's where it gets tricky... I scan through the 7ish hours of footage, and there's nothing - nobody came into the room that night between me leaving and coming back. I look in the safe again, and my ipad, passport, and cash are still there exactly as I left them, just without my camera on top. I literally tore out that curly fake plastic ""carpet"" lining of the safe, and inspected it very thoroughly to ensure that there was no secret door or crap like that - everything checked out. I searched the room, but nothing, and checked with the lost and found at the front desk as well. I didn't end up finding my camera in the last sweep of the room before I checked out a few days later either, but at least I had some pictures from the days before it went missing. 

I arrive back home, and as I'm putting my stuff away, my camera is right there in my desk drawer! I couldn't believe it, and I asked my housemates if someone had mailed it back after finding it (After my first loss, I keep a locked picture with a P.O. box address that my house shares on the memory card) But to my surprise, they said that no such package ever arrived. Confused, I examine the camera and it's definitely mine, it had the same small scratch in the corner of the screen.

A few days later, my friends create a dropbox for us to share all our pictures, but when I go to upload mine, they're nowhere to be found, and now there's only photos from before the trip on the memory card on the camera. I use Aperture to manage my photos, but the event I created for it was gone, nothing was in the trash of either aperture or osx, I tried using the recover database feature but the program didn't find any discrepancies. At this point I'm shaking a little, I call up my friends and ask if they remember me taking pictures, but nobody can remember for sure.

Now I don't even know what to think, how my camera disappeared then reappeared, and the pictures are mysteriously gone (I use FileVault and a secure password, nobody has access to my laptop but me) I chalked it up to too much booze and thinking I had my camera when in reality I was in charge of a friend's, and I download all the photos that everyone else took. As I'm going through them, my stomach drops - someone had taken a picture of me taking a picture - with my camera. Out of over a thousand photos, there is only one, but that one was enough. So now I have proof that my camera was indeed with me in Madrid.

I still don't know what happened there, other than when the matrix did a system restore, it dropped the bits of data that noted my camera was in the hotel safe in Madrid and not at home in my desk.  

Oh but wait, it gets better. The same thing has happened again, this time on my trip to Cape Town, South Africa, in May 2012. I left my camera on my friend's nightstand with my passport and wallet, and went to the living room that was directly across the hallway. I worked on my laptop for a few hours, always with a direct line of sight to her bedroom door - nobody came or went. When we decided that we all wanted to go out, I go in to grab my camera and wallet, but only my wallet is there. I mentioned I thought I had left it right there to my friend, but she just said she'd take her camera because it was a long way to the bar that everyone else had chosen and we didn't have time. She locked her bedroom door on way out, and also the front door and gate. The next morning, I do a full search of her room, but the camera isn't anywhere. I find out that her two housemates were gone all night as well; they left before us and came back later. That was my last day in South Africa, so later that afternoon I go to the airport, and as I'm waiting at the gate, my pictures that I had dutifully downloaded from my camera every night were gone! 

I couldn't believe this was happening again, and it crossed my mind that my camera was in my desk at home, but in the air on the way back, I manage to recover all my photos (only the South Africa ones) using the database repair tool. I get home, no camera, but I'm holding out hope that it has appeared somewhere that I haven't looked yet. 

TL;DR Locked camera in hotel safe in Spain, set laptop to record the door and safe (because of past bas experience), left to go clubbing, camera went missing, but footage shows nobody entered the room. Scrutinized the safe but everything checked out. Searched the room and asked housekeeping / front desk but nothing. Got home and found my camera in my desk drawer. Tried to upload photos to shared folder on dropbox, but all photos on macbook are gone, recovery efforts failed, no photos from the trip on the memory card either. Thought I dreamed bringing my camera since we partied so hard and so much, but found a photo that a friend took clearly showing me taking a picture with my camera. Fast forward about a year and it goes missing under equally strange (and secure) circumstances on vacation in South Africa.

First thing are the youtube like comments ie 'wow awesome story,' 'thats crazy,' 'interesting glitch,' and comments in that nature, being the top comments. There is so much potential for this subreddit to be a place of discussion and sharing experiences; theories and anectdotes rather than empty comments. Also I think skeptics here, instead of rejecting stories or theories as false, imagination, or just giving outlandish 'logical explanations,' be more open minded and willing to look into alternative explanations/theories. On the other hand I also dislike it when made up theories lead to speculation. I'm ok with making up theories with evidence/ sources to back it up but not ambigious ones. Anyway I just think this subreddit would be better if comments had more little critical and objective reasoning and also open mindedness.

In college I had a very angry strict teacher. She had a rule on cellphones, if she even glimpsed it you would be kicked out of class for that day. One day I accidentally left my phone in my house. It wasn't really a nuisance because I normally use it to check the time or for emergencies. When I get to class I usually take my seat near the window for lecture days. That day was a lecture day. Well all of a sudden I hear a phone start to ring. There wasn't a specific ringtone to it, just the standard ringing cellphones get. The problem was the ringing was coming from my lower right side. Which was impossible because no one was sitting next to me, I was near the window. When it started, everyone naturally assumed it was mine so they gave me a sympathetic look, cause when you get caught with a cell that professor rains hell on you. The ringing continued like a normal phone would when you don't answer, eventually i guess it went to voicemail.

After being kicked out I started looking in my bag in case someone accidentally dropped their phone in. (My ring tone is the Bohemian Rhapsody by Queen so i knew it wasn't mine) Eventually i gave up and went to go wait in front of my next class. Usually the chairs in the hall get filled up quick so it was a miracle I managed to find one. Then all of a sudden, again to my lower right I heard a phone ringing. There was nothing there just an empty floor. Then the guy next to me turns and asks if i'm going to get that, but realizing the ringing was coming from (to *his* lower left) the floor, he stops mid sentence and looks puzzled. To this day I can't figure out where that ringing was coming from. I've had other weird things happen to me, but this is the only time a phone has been involved.

From Phoenix, Az to San Diego, Ca is 5 hours. Only 6 to get to Los Angeles which was the trip in this Glitch. 

It was myself and and the girl I was dating at the time and we decided to take a road trip to Six Flags. It was during the drive out in the middle of the Arizona desert that the Glitch hit....

I saw a piece of engine bouncing out of the Ford Explorer...bouncing...hoppping... then jumping right through my windshield....
hitting me in my right shoulder, crushing my rib cage and heart. It was then that I refocused to where I was at, which now felt like where I was.

it was then I came out of if with a shiver, still going 88 mph behind the Ford. My GF asked me what happened, my response was ""That Explorer is in trouble, and so are we.""

As my last words trailed out sparks started flying from the under-carriage. At 11pm in the middle of the desert it was the most amazing, yet terrifying thing I have ever seen.

As the sparks flew I saw what looked like the transistor fall out and start bouncing.... hopping... but this time, I slammed on the breaks before the jump could happen. The tires squealed.... The metal jumped and I hit the gas. The shrapnel nicks off my windshield but this ""thrill"" is not yet over....

The front end of this late 90s Ford Explorer drops to the ground sending even more sparks. Luckily for us the left lane was open.  The Ford lost speed and the front axle ended up flying loose. Further left I went into the desert shoulder to avoid an even bigger hunk of ""american"" made ""steel"". 

We came out unscathed, not even a mark in the windshield....


EDIT: Although we didn't stop we did call 911 and let them know what mile marker this happened at. My car is small so i couldn't have given them a ride anyways without leaving either myself or my girl with random stangers in the car or the desert.

After a mile the GF asked me,
""Should we stop and help them?""
with my adrenaline at the highest it has ever been the only response I could give was ""I don't want to help or even meet the people who almost killed us by taking their shitty car on a road trip when its still 100 degrees at 11pm in the middle of the desert.""

Chambers' *The King in Yellow* was one of my earliest literary influences in horror, even before I had delved into Poe, Lovecraft, and later, Danielewski, Ligotti, etc. He directly influenced H.P. Lovecraft and Hastur has been incorporated as part of the Lovecraftian mythos. For those unaware, the mythos is generally depicted as something vaguely plausible in the untamed reaches of Africa, the Pacific isles, the dark and untamed corners of the Earth (and New England in the '20s). 

*The King in Yellow* is a collection of short stories vaguely revolving around a play of the same name which, when read, drives the reader insane. I won't spoil it beyond that, but needless to say, it's a delightfully creepy 1890s cosmic horror story that deeply affected in a significant way.

I owned a somewhat old copy of the book; it was nothing antique but not what one might refer to as brand new, either. It was a book that I returned to often and I kept it in my car between the front and passenger seat, on the floor (there was no centre console). The car was kept clean and orderly at all times. At most, I might set a CD case on top of the book.

I had started reading the book again at some point. While the car was a nice place to keep the book, it was not particularly useful when I wanted to read it at home. So, I walked out to the car, unlocked it (even in a middle class suburban neighbourhood like mine, it was always a good idea to lock the car doors), and picked the CD cases off of the book. The bottom CD case was wet. This was somewhat alarming. What was more alarming was that the book was also wet. 

The book was also dirty. It was smeared in dirt and dead leaves, like it had been left in a forest overnight during a rainstorm. When I lifted the book off of the floor, there was a dirt stain in the shape of the book and the floor was also drenched directly underneath. The stain and water spot seemed to flow outward as if the book, itself, was the source. The CD cases on top were also perfectly dry. It was only the bottom one that was wet and dirty, and only where had been touching the book.

This was all pretty disconcerting on its own, but I was mostly worried about the book. I figured that I could still read it if I cleaned it off and let it dry. I opened it to check for damage only to find that it was filled with tiny insects of some sort (not ants, not termites, just... I don't know, little bugs). That was the proverbial straw which made me finally get rid of a book for the first time. However, not immediately.

I left the book in the garage to show to a friend. I occasionally see things like this that aren't real, so I needed external confirmation of what I was seeing. Long story sho- er, slightly less long, I received the confirmation and the aforementioned friend concurred with my analysis re: that's creepy as hell.

I don't know if I can believe in such folly as supernatural forces or ""glitches,"" so I remain at least fairly resolute in that there is some logical explanation. However, other than a cruel prank from someone who knows where I keep my keys, I'm not sure what that explanation would be. The wetness could be from a spilled drink that somehow avoided The dirt and leaves were nowhere else in the car and, being underneath other things, there's no real way they could have migrated into the book if the book was left where it was. The fact that the mess was specifically focused on the book is also bizarre as it suggests that the book was dirtied elsewhere and returned to the car (which, I reiterate, was locked). 

So, either the book was cursed, someone had a strange concept of humour, or I had a psychotic episode which I forgot about. ",,False,,t5_2tcwa,False,,,True,t3_1iw7nh,http://www.reddit.com/r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix/comments/1iw7nh/the_yellow_sign/,

I chose an old touch-tone phone in our basement that didn't work (I plugged it in to a working phone jack, no dial tone).

I took it completely apart, meticulously labelling every wire and screw, and then put it back together again. I did this all at home. I can't remember how exactly the assignment worked. Maybe I had to bring it in to school while it was all taken apart to prove I'd taken it apart? It's been a while, I'm not sure.

I did not test it to see if it worked before I handed it in. My teacher, though, when he returned it to me with my grade, told me that he had tested it at the school, and had got a dial tone.

It happened just now, in fact; I'm uploading this right after I witnessed this glitch.

I was sitting down, eating some lunch (a grilled cheese sandwich) while doing some browsing on my iPad. Once I was finished eating, I washed my plate and left the kitchen to go upstairs and take a shower. Around twenty minutes later, I came back in to get my iPad, but that's where the mindfuck happens.

I see someone sitting at the table, holding my iPad in one hand, and eating...a grilled cheese sandwich. The page he was browsing was the same one I was browsing twenty minutes ago. He was wearing the same exact clothes I was wearing before I had taken my shower. And his appearance was that of mine. It was *me*.

I only stared at him--or me. He finished the sandwich and got up to wash his plate, just as I had done. After that, he walked away from the dishwasher right towards me, but judging by his expression, he didn't seem to notice I was there at all. I was completely petrified. As soon as his body met mine, he vanished. Just...poof. He was gone.

After finally coming to my senses from the shock and disorientation my mind was going through after seeing that, I formed some sort of conclusion.

About 7 years ago, I had a friend pass away from an asthma attack (this isn't about him, just giving the details). We lived in Southwest Texas, but his funeral was in Houston (East Texas). My friend's dad decides to drive us there and me and two other friends make the trip. We were about 15-16 at the time, so we couldn't drive ourselves that far. We go to the funeral and then my friend's dad takes us to eat. We eat at a Whataburger in Houston and this is where the story really begins.

We eat our burgers and when we're getting ready to leave, my friend realizes he's missing his phone. He claims he had it with him the entire time he was eating, but he can't find it anywhere. We hadn't thrown our trash away and nobody had left the table the entire time. We search for it everywhere and none of us had it with us. After a bit of searching, we go out to the car and look for it everywhere there. Still can't find it. Back inside the restaurant, we search one last time at our table. After about 20-30 minutes of searching for it everywhere, he decides to just forget about it. We suggest that he may have left it at the graveyard or at the family's house, but he insists he had it with him at Whataburger and he had shown us something on it, so we all agree he lost it there or it was stolen.

We drove off anyway to head back home, leaving the phone behind (or so we thought). On the way home, all of my friends fall asleep except for me, because I never have been able to sleep during car rides. I'm sitting in the back driver's side seat and leaning my head on the window, when my friend's dad decides to stop at a gas station just south of San Antonio (South Central Texas, about 200 miles from Houston) for some coffee. He parks and about two parking spots down I see it. It's the same phone! I get out of the car right behind my friend's dad and I pick it up. One of my friends wakes up as I get in the car and I don't say anything. I didn't assume it was his phone, but it was the same model and color. It was off, so I turn it on before waking up my friends or saying anything. I figured I'd try to call someone and let them know that I'd be leaving the phone at the counter of the gas station. When the phone turns on, I see my friend's welcome message! Naturally, I freak out and wake everyone up to show them the phone. I told my friends the story and nobody believes me. The owner of the phone is very mad at me because he thinks I was hiding it the entire time. Everyone is kind of upset at me for making them go through all that looking just for a prank. I insist that I found it there, but I understand it's hard to believe. My friend's dad didn't see me pick it up, but he saw me get out of the car then not follow him into the store.

I've thought of all the possibilities and nothing makes sense. After a while, my friends started to believe me due to my story always being consistent about it. They suggested that maybe my friend's dad had it and dropped it, but I'm positive that I saw it out there as we were pulling up and he was still in the car driving. The only other possibility I can come up with that makes any sense is that someone stole it then coincidentally dropped it at the same gas station, but what are the chances of that? I still think about it quite a bit.

**TL;DR:** Friend lost his phone in a Whataburger in Houston, I find it in a parking lot south of San Antonio.

Me and a friend of mine were working together moving pallets to the floor so they can have packages stacked and wrapped to later be shipped to the smaller delivery offices in the area. I notice he had a long line of chalk on the bottom part of his right forearm, I tell him,"" Hey man, you got some chalk on your arm."" I turn away to toss a pallet and then turn back to him. Blood is now pouring down his arm out the six inch ""line"" I told him about! I ask him what he did to make himself start bleeding and he says all he did was look at his arm and noticed he had a deep cut but there was no blood. He said it was just like a light pink opening in his skin and that he didn't start bleeding until he finally realized it was a cut. We tried to figure out how long he had the cut before I pointed it out but it could have been at anytime during the day, the wooden pallets are pretty worn and sometimes have nails sticking out the we nick ourselves on.

Back in college, in my philosophy class, I learned about a philosophy/belief that things/reactions only happen because we expect them to happen. Does anyone know who came up with that theory or can elaborate more on that belief? So in following with that theory: My friend didn't bleed because he didn't know he had a cut, and only bled once he noticed he had a cut because... that's what cuts do?

After it happened and I came to the realization that something really, really fucked up happened, I sort of halfway blocked it out. But I still wonder about it from time to time. I found this subreddit a few days ago and after reading some submissions I thought I'd see what you guys thought.

So basically we had this third story patio that me and my roommate shared, it had two doors on either side, one connected to my room and one to his, and we had camping chairs outside that we'd smoke cigs in. 

We were outside one night and I was with my roommate and and one other friend. We were sitting and talking and all of a sudden something with a small surface area (like a fist, or the back of a cat) pushed up on the bottom of my chair. It pushed up fairly hard too, enough for me to jump up and be like ""what the fuck was that."" I startled my friends, but I remembered that sometimes if I accidentally left my patio door open my cat would sneak out and he'd go under my chair and arch his back up to scratch it on the bottom of the chair. My cat wasn't normally allowed outside so this wasn't a common enough occurrence to not startle me I guess. 

Anyways, thinking that my cat was out I stood up to put him back in, but when I looked at my door it was closed, and my cat was sitting there staring at me through the glass door. As my friends looked at me like I was insane I checked the whole patio for any other animal but there was nothing. Yet, the force of that push was enough to push me upwards a tiny bit. It absolutely couldn't have been something with the chair. Something else did that. When I realized that I couldn't explain it, I had this really weird feeling in my stomach and I refused to say anything about it to my friends. I sort of blocked it out after that. I know it's not as crazy as some of the stories here but it still sits in the back of my head at night you know?

I was in my Spanish class, and my friends and I were messing around, not doing anything. One of the girls in our group was a huge art lover, and so she showed us this drawing of her name she did in art class, where she had to make the letters of her name out of some sort of ""element"" that represented who she was. She was very proud of it, but was upset because she accidentally messed up, combining the ""n"" and the ""i"" in her name (Tina). She put the ""a"" directly after the ""n"" so she just ended dotting the ""n"" instead. 

Fast forward to the next day, we're talking about nothing in particular and Tina wants to show us something she did in art class last period. So she gets out her name thing, and asks us what we thought of it. I said something along the lines of ""very funny Tina, you showed us this yesterday, coz you messed up the n and the i.""
And she just looked at me like wtf are you saying? And then says ""I made this last period, and I just noticed that now."" Freaked me out.

Moments after we finished the last scene, my phone started to vibrate  repeatedly, faster than if I was getting a phone call.  I looked at it and saw that I was receiving the same text, sent from the email address tomtommom1234@gmail.com, over and over again (screenshots below).  It read: ""Can we be friends?"".  When I got back to my room I started asking friends if they were messing with me.  I received 84 copies of the message in all, which seemed very over the top for some sort of prank especially for someone who I wouldn't know personally.  One of my brothers' names is Tom so I checked with him too and no one could give me an answer about it.  I also googled the email address to see if it was a known spam bot or something, to no avail.  I decided to treat it as if I had actually received a message back from ET, so I sent an email to that address.  Since I was coming home soon for Thanksgiving break, and I live in a more remote area than where I take classes, I told them: ""Of course, let's meet up when I get back home"".  The second or third night of my break I go out to the local rec park with my friends to smoke at around 10pm.  At around 10:50 we saw 4 red lights ascending in unison, taking off towards our right one at a time and disappearing.  I'm not saying I contacted aliens, but I thought it was interesting enough to share and see if I could get any answers.  Thoughts?

We were celebrating my grandparents 50th wedding anniversary.  All my family had decided to stay together at a country resort in some cottages.  These cottages were large and all of family could stay in two of them.  The cottages were like a large house which was divided into different rooms like a hotel.  These cottages were old and since there was other people near by in at the resort we had to lock the door when we weren't home.  The key to door the door was a typical house key, not like a hotel key card kind of key.

We were all outside having a BBQ and I had to use the bathroom.  I get one of the only two keys from my Mom to open our part of the cottage.  My Dad had the other key.  I always put the key on the kitchen table so I wouldn't lose it and it would be easy to grab on the way out to lock the door again.  So using the bathroom I think about how maybe I should have brought the key in with me so I could just leave and not stop at the kitchen table.  I had pictured where I left it on the table (I was pretty bad about losing stuff so I wanted to make sure it was safe.  I didn't want to be the one to lose the key and then force my family to pay extra money to have another key made for our room) and looked out the window.  I was still thinking about how it would be nice if the key was closer but I knew I'd just have to pick it up where I always left it on the table.  When I finished using the toilet I looked over at the counter of the bathroom, and there is was, the key.  I believe there was some sort of glitch because I was thinking it would be nice to have the key nearby, actually thinking if I had brought it into the bathroom, I would have placed it there.  After finishing in the bathroom I take the key which somehow ended up in the bathroom with me.  I leave our cottage and go back to the BBQ weirded out.  I ask my Dad if he had the other key and he said yes and then I gave my Mom back the key I'd used which had somehow transported itself in the bathroom from the kitchen.  Never told anyone else this at the reunion because I knew no one would believe me.

The last thing I saw before blacking out was a puzzlingly clean hand.

The next thing I remember is sitting up in the same spot. I reached for my head again and found my helmet!

I personally try not to look into things too much but I'm just generally interested in the metaphysical and whatnot. This experience is similar to one I read on here not too long ago about the [water going down the stairs](http://www.reddit.com/r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix/comments/124icj/i_saw_a_waterfall_in_my_house_that_ended_up/), and is something I can honestly say has happened a few times.

Anyways, my room at my house is just next to the kitchen on the main floor. On occasion, my roommates new cat will jump up and grab on to the edge of the trash can in the corner of the kitchen. This, of course, causes it to fall over with a relatively loud noise. (He just wants to eat the garbage, even with his own food out, I don't know...) I can for sure say it is the largest item in the kitchen that would make such a sound when falling over, aside from the chairs which are far too heavy for a small cat to take down.

So, a few days back (maybe Tuesday or Wednesday of this week) I'm lying down in my room and I hear the sound of something falling over onto the kitchen floor. Having just thrown away some food of mine, I assume it was the cat going after some scraps so I immediately got up to stop him. On my way out of my bedroom door, however, I spotted the cat sleeping/lying down in his bed across the living room. I then turned into the kitchen where the trash can was standing straight up as usual.

I then went back to my room for a moment. Though no more than maybe 10 or 15 minutes later I go out to smoke a cigarette, and the funny thing is, when I come back in the cat is eating from the spilled trash can that he had just knocked over.

Me, and five or six of my high school friends were up at the park.  The park consisted of a field, parking lot, a couple picnic table/grills under a canopy, and a few acres of woods.  We would head up there quite often, mostly just to smoke, play bocci ball, and hang out.

It was during the summer, and it was getting dark, so I put it around 8-9ish.  We were all standing in a circle in the parking lot just talking.  We had either just gotten done smoking, or were playing hacky sack.  Now that I think of if, we were standing to close to have just hacked.  I think we were done smoking, and standing around smoking cigarettes, talking.

As we are standing there, we see something flying overhead.  It was coming from the north, so I was hidden by the trees until it was fairly close.  It did not have any guide lights as you would expect on an airplane, nor was it making any noise as you would expect from a helicopter.

(Before I go any farther, I feel it necessary to point out that we were probably high, but to anyone who has smoked with any regularity, you know that you don't just start seeing shit.  Our whole group smoked quite a bit for a couple years, and we were all still pretty with it even after smoking a lot.  I try to tell people the story and they just say ""oh dude you were so high haha.""  But that is not what has happening.)

So we all see this object flying over us, silent.  And it was light enough to still see the sky, but fairly dark in the parking lot where we were standing.  What I am saying, is that it was easy to see the object against the sky, but it was still dark enough for the next part to be relevant.

As we look at it coming toward us, we all felt (having discovered this discussing the incident afterwards) a disconnect in our brains because you expected to see flashing lights or hearing a noise, but there was nothing.  Just a single shape and a single, constant light coming toward us.

Right when it flies over us - much lower than a plane would be - the object shined a light down onto us.  It didn't drag a spotlight across the pavement, the circle didn't exist before or after it hit us.  It appeared with an overwhelming brightness for a fraction of a second.  It was a prefect circle and it only existed for a split-second, and only is exactly one location.  I distinctly remember looking at the pavement across the circle, and a pitch-blackness, and an almost infinite brightness; and in such a clear distinction.  The line was not blurred.  It was pencil-thin.  It was such an impossibility for a light to shine from such a height and not blend at all.  You would expect, based on how bright the light was in the circle, that the entire parking lot would be bright for 100 feet.  But that wasn't the case. Long story short, even if someone was pranking us, or it was a mechanical disfunction, the way it happened was physically impossible.

After it happened, we all looked at each other for probably 5-10 seconds, everyone thinking, ""am I going crazy.""

""Did anyone else see that...?"" someone said with a genuine confusion.  We all kinda looked at each other and slowed nodded, not really sure what happened.

We discussed that incident for a little bit, all kinda weirded out by the whole thing.  We checked the clock in the car to see if we lost any time.  No one had cell phones at the time, and the car clock at kinda wonky, so we never came up with a clear answer.  Two of my friends insist we were at least 20 minutes gone, but I'm not sure if I agree.  I honestly have no idea now, 10 years later, but I remember thinking at the time that everything seemed okay.

Regardless of what happened, it is easily the most unexplainable thing that has ever happened to me.

It was weird, but I could've sworn I was already on my bed ready to sleep! Still no idea what happened.

EDIT: Since this has gotten a little bit of attention, I'll give a little more detailed information.

1. I couldn't remember the time that I reached home 'the first time', therefore I'm not sure if the time has changed.

2. My bag containing all of my work stuff that I NEVER leave home without, is safely placed on the kitchen counter where I usually put it before/after work. Strangely, I couldn't remember whether I brought it to work that day or that I already put it there when I got home 'the first time'.

3. The car was parked in the exact position that it was in 'the first time' and I distinctly remembered because there was a piece of paper stuck underneath the tyre which I saw when I got out of the car 'the first time'.

Of course I obliged. I opened the front door all the way, as it's a door on hinges, and I opened the porch door about halfway (this is a heavy metal and glass sliding door) as I looked outside to see how much wood there was. Possibly relevant information: my porch is about 8ft long by 6ft wide. The majority of the wood was blocked from my view at the porch door by a bush, so I stepped down the two steps to guage how many trips I'd need to take.

As much as I tried to carry them all at once, the longer pieces of wood were too unweildly with the shorter pieces. However I did managed to get all of the smaller pieces in my arms, but there were quite a lot of them so as soon as stood up I realised I might end up dropping them trying to get through the door. When I turned and walked around the bush I noticed that the sliding glass door was more open than what I recall leaving it. In fact I stopped and stared at it and then looked around the neighbourhood to make sure I was alone in my front garden, but nothing else, apart from the door being more open than I remember, seemed out of place. And I didn't hear the door move or anyone around me, so I figured to myself I must have opened it wider than I initially thought and then forgot about it.

By way of going through the house, as quickly as I could I took those smaller pieces of wood to the back garden, and proceeded back through the front door into the porch, at which point I stopped again. This time the sliding door was only halfway open, about by the same amount as I first thought I had opened it. I stepped back into the hall to make sure there was no one creeping around my house because this time I knew for certain I didn't close the door that much, because my arms were too full to be able to close the door and hold a pile of wood.

The show ended, and in the silence I realized how loud my neighbours above me were being. I decided to go to Grooveshark to drown them out a little. I opened a new tab and I got a ""Problem loading"" page. I tried other websites and realized the internet was out. This wasn't an uncommon occurrence in this apartment, but it usually fixed itself pretty quickly. This time it didn't. 

I looked at the time on my alarm clock next to my bed. It read ""8:31."" It wasn't too late so I decided to make tea and wait for the internet to fix itself. I went into the kitchen, filled the kettle, put it on the stove and turned the element on. I stepped back and leaned against the counter just waiting. I noticed that the light was dim, which wasn't completely strange because the light in the kitchen has a dimmer switch and it was easy to move it when you turn the light on. After a while I realized the indicator light on the stove wasn't on and the kettle wasn't getting hot. The stove wasn't working. I had only just moved into the apartment a few months prior, so I wasn't sure if this was a common thing. I just forgot about the tea and went back to my room. 

I checked and the internet still wasn't working. I sat on my bed next to my roommate's cat, Caesar, unsure of what to do with myself (I wasn't in the mood to read). I went to pet Caesar on his head and he quickly got up, moved a little further away from me, and sat back down. This was strange because he fucking loves getting pet on the head. He consistently wakes me up in the middle of the night, rubbing his head on my hand. I noticed that he wasn't taking his eyes off of my desk-chair, or at least my desk area. I was feeling kind of weird about everything. I looked at my alarm clock and it read ""8:31."" I remember jumping up and looking at the time on my laptop. It also read ""8:31."" 

I'm a little embarrassed to admit this, but I was just strangely frightened. I remember I had goosebumps all over my body and I felt sick to my stomach. I knocked on my brother's door (he lives with me). I remember instantly feeling better when I stepped in his room. I felt really safe and content. I asked him what time it was, and he said ""8:44."" I asked him if his internet was out too and he said he had been playing TF2 for the past two hours, so no. I asked him if the stove sometimes doesn't work, and he said he's never had any problems with it (he's lived here for 4 years). I couldn't think of any excuse to stay there and I didn't really want to tell him what was happening because he'd just call me an idiot. When I opened his door and left, all the lights in the hallway, kitchen, livingroom, and my bedroom were on and seemed very bright. My other roommate was out, so it couldn't have been her. I went into my room and my alarm clock read ""8:34."" My internet worked and everything seemed Kosher. 

**TL;DR:** My electronics quit, my pants filled with shit. Things got less dreary, but overall it was eery.

I was in school, my brother was in the year behind me, and we used to go to a local park (St. Stephens Green) pretty regularly over lunch break. Just to play around and stuff, because it was close to the school and we weren't technically allowed out of the school grounds so it had an air of the forbidden about it too.  

One day I woke up and had the strangest sensation that I'd lived this day already. In its entirety. But I knew it had to come from a dream because I can remember what I got up to yesterday in great detail whereas in this case, I could just remember bits and pieces.   

These were the things I remembered before they happened -
I remembered we had to run for the bus. (No biggie, that was commonplace and can be ascribed to co-incidence)  
I remembered we sat up near the front because Darren was already on the bus and had a free seat up there.  
I remembered a classmate getting into trouble and getting smacked by the teacher. Again, all easy to put down to coincidence.  

Over lunch break on the way to the park, I tell my brother all about how I'm remembering all these things as if I've lived them before. But it's not like deja-vu exactly.  

Then in the park, we were about to cross a section where you're not supposed to walk on the grass. And I stop my brother and tell him there is a grounds keeper about to walk around the corner. Which happens a few seconds later.  

Later on over the lunch break, we're climbing on some rocks near the lake, and I remembered my brother slipping and falling in. So I reached out and caught him as he was falling.   

On the way back to school, I told him that I remembered he had fallen in and got wet up to his knees. That this in turn had made us late back to school and we got into trouble. By catching him, and not getting wet, we made it back to the school on time and didn't get into trouble. And that was the last bit of ""remembered"" info I got for that day.

I needed to head to her work and get her key so that I could hang out in her apt for the day. 

A tram line runs along the street where I was coming from. After hopping on and waiting a few stops went by, then a girl got on with a really sweet engagement/wedding ring on her finger. I noticed because she put her hand up to hold on to the handle which put it in my line of sight. 

The stop after that another girl got on, this one was talking on the phone. I remembered her because a hobo got his jacket stuck in the doors and she tried to help him out. 

So we all go to the same stop which allows us to get on the metro. After the doors opened I was concentrating on me so everyone went their own ways. I grabbed the next metro, went to my gf's work, and grabbed the key. Took maybe 15-20 minutes, she had to run back into work so I headed back to the metro. 

Now in order to get to the stop I needed, I had to get on the metro going the *same* way as I had just come. So If I headed north to my gf's work, I still had to head north. (for example sake) 

I went to get onto the metro and take it to the next junction so that I could switch directions. I caught the next metro I could and was on my way. 

Once I arrived at the junction and went to get off I noticed to the right of me, the girl with the ring, which weirded me out but I figured i just mistook her. Then I turned my head to the front of me, and I noticed the second girl, the one who was on the phone and who helped the hobo out.

I live in London, so morning rush hour is pretty mental, and usually involves a lot of cyclists, cabs, buses and cars jostling for what little space London's archaic road system affords.

While waiting for the bus I saw a swarm of cyclists riding down the bus  lane. In their midst was a car, a white BMW, with a pissed-off-looking asian driver. He was obviously annoyed at being swamped by cyclists: they were literally *surrounding* him on all sides, back and front.

Anyway, this strange formation passed right by me. For the briefest moment after they passed I kept looking down the road in the direction they came, scanning for my bus, mentally chuckling to myself about how the guy shouldn't have been driving in the bus lane.

I then turn to look at them again. And the fucking white BMW is *gone*. As in, the fucker just disappeared. The cyclist swarm were still there, charging down the road, but there was *no car*.

The next turn off was a good fifty metres down the road, and anyway, when I looked the formation hadn't passed it.

The funny thing is, when they passed by me and I got a glimpse of the driver and his comical pissed-off expression, I thought just how *out of place* he looked. Breaking the law (technically) by driving in the bus lane, obviously a noob to London driving... and that the cyclists seemed to have no qualms about swamping him on all sides.

I have no explanation, and it's the first 'disappearing' glitch I've encountered. Whether the problem is with my perception, or with the external world, I have no idea.

I thought nothing of it as we sat down to eat dinner.  My child brain got sidetracked and I didn't think about the pencil sharpeners until later that night when I was laying in bed.

I often (every 1-2 weeks) have ""visions"" or ""flash-forwards"" where I'll just be day dreaming or something and just for a fleeting moment a scene that seems to be from the near future will cross my mind. I generally make nothing of them, they're generally quite mundane, just something that happens in the classroom or something someone says. Then, generally within 6 weeks, this scene occurs. I used to pass it off as just de ja vu, but it has happened far too frequently for me to really be able to keep saying that. 

I'm not normally one to believe in superstitions or the supernatural but it has really started to make me think. I also do get the odd useful one (ie; a flash-forward to an exam and I can see one or two questions, and then they turn up and I'm positive I've done them before). 

I don't know if this would particularly be counted as a ""glitch"" but it has just made me incredibly curious. 


Another thing is I often find myself just sitting down after a long day and zoning out for a minute or two, and all of a sudden it has been *hours*. I haven't fall asleep (I am generally just sitting down or standing in a position where I would've collapsed if I had fallen asleep) and I know that it hasn't been that long, because I would've noticed the light changing and my family getting home and whatnot.

I played piano for around 8 years as a child and I didn't enjoy it. The skills and knowledge I have now, I'm appreciateive of, however as a pre-teen to early teen, I did not enjoy having to practice my piano songs every morning for 20 minutes before school.

I don't want to bore you so basically what happened was one morning I woke up normal time with the alarm clock and my favourite radio station news to confirm the time. (just before 7am)

Soon after the shower and breakfast, it was time to do the 20 minute piano session. I was reluctant but knew I had to as my father wasn't someone to mess with. 

I used to count every minute of that 20 minute practice every morning. That's how much I despised being forced to practice something I didn't really enjoy.

Then this one morning I was practising the piano and my father came out in a disorganised state (very unusual for a long term Army person), asking me slightly frantically why I'm still playing piano.

It was 8:12am and I'd been practising for nearly an hour.

He was trying to tell me I'd be late for school but I was so astounded that I'd been practising for an hour that I was stunned listening to him try to tell me what time it was. I kept checking the clocks around the house.

The concept of me playing for that long when I hated doing it and I usually counted every minute of the 20 minutes, was just plain... unexplainable. (Every morning I'd keep my watch on the piano so I knew exactly when the 20 minutes was up and I could stop)

To this day I don't know what happened but somehow both my father and I lost nearly an hour of time and we don't know how. (I don't talk to him and haven't for a long time so we've never discussed this)

 Well I am trying to apply to this program for a second time at my school and needed some info i had written down this time last year on a little post it note when applying to the same program. I figured I had thrown it out because it was small and i did not think i would need the info again (my old highschool gpa..) but i figured i would look through my whole desk just in case as it is a great hassle to try and get it from my old school, and had absolutely no luck after looking three days in a row through everywhere it possibly could have been in and around my whole room. 

well this morning, days after looking for the note, I was planing to go to the school but i was running a little late for a meet-up so decided to skip it. I come back tonight, sit on my desk, and all of a sudden i see an orange post it note sitting right next to my mouse on the desk, sticky side up.

About three or four nights ago, my boyfriend and I were in a car with some friends. We were about to leave from our apartment building, when I needed to put something back inside. My boyfriend had the keys, and he passed them to me. I put the item inside the apartment, and went back into the car.

Fast forward to when we return. As we pull up to the building, I open my purse, and start hunting for the keys. I can't find them anywhere. I open the car door to turn on the internal light (it's night time), and begin taking things out of my purse. No keys, anywhere. My boyfriend is slightly upset, because he gave them to me for safekeeping, and I somehow lost them. He moves toward me, intending to go through my purse himself, and we hear a jingle.

I say, ""Yeah, I put them in my purse. Didn't I? You watched me.""

Little back story: I grew up in a working family, both parents having full time jobs.  Each day my grandmother picked my younger sister and I up from school and took us to her house.  She would do girl things with my sister while my grandfather played chess with me and taught me life lessons.  He was a devout pre vatican II Roman Catholic, from Italy that fled when it became fascist and joined the US Air Force.  He passed away before my 10th birthday and I was exceptionally distraught.  It was sudden and my last experience with him was a stupid argument where I was acting like a spoiled child because he wouldn't take me to see Three Ninjas.  It was like losing a father, and deeply effected me for years.  I became more or less a shut in and deal type of coping mechanism.  All of the items I inherited from him were packed away in an attic box.

Fast forward a couple years, I'm at a major milestone in the Catholic religion, completing a first right in one of their sacraments.  When the family celebration was done, I retired to my bedroom and cried a lot.  I missed him and events involving the church brought back memories more than anything else.  I started to say my evening prayers like every other night the way he and my parents had me do . . . but it was the first time that I reached out to him, rather than 'God'.  An overwhelming calm came over me at that point and I fell asleep.  The next morning I woke up and went to go about my day when I moved to get out of bed something poked me in the side.  It was a crucifix that he left for me, one of his most prized possessions from one of his visits to Jerusalem.  I checked and nothing was disturbed in the attic or the closet with the attic access.  The dust was untouched on the box it was kept in.  

Ever since that night I've been able to overcome every one of my fears and gain an almost super human (compared to the way I felt before that) clarity of mind by simply thinking to myself 'Grandpa, give me strength'.  I know redditors will probably down vote this due to the religious context, but consider instead of the common consciousness research and new findings people are making every day in neuroscience.  I'm not of any particular religion myself, I don't consider it a religious experience, rather a profound and still unexplained life changing experience.  Every time I think of it the same feeling washes over me, the physical feeling is similar to the chill you get when you feel dread or fear . . . but the mental feeling that comes with it is a completely calm sense of clarity - the opposite of fear.",,False,,t5_2tcwa,False,,,True,t3_of3j5,http://www.reddit.com/r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix/comments/of3j5/grandpa_reaching_out_from_beyond/,

I can't remember how long... Maybe a year, maybe two years.

I had a dream that I was in a truck, way out in the country. I really can't recall if I was driving or a passenger. Nothing amazing happened, but the front tire of the truck fell off and it got all wobbly. It went off the road but it wasn't a violent crash, no one died or anything. At the time the dream didn't seem interesting or significant. I have weird dreams every night. It was kind of vivid, but it seemed stupid so I just went about my day. 

I went to school and did a bunch of random stuff, whatever. My dad called me after work, like he always did at that time in my life. He said he was at the car garage. And the weirdest feeling came over me. I remembered the dream, and I asked him if it was because the tire fell off. He said yes. Then I asked if it was the front right tire, and he said yes. His front right tire fell off when he was driving to work that morning.

So I was able to say the problem with the car, right down to the exact tire... The odds of ""guessing"" or knowing the specific car problem are very slim. And then to choose between 4 tires... Yeah, no way.

He was freaked out, but didn't make a huge deal out of it. I remember him saying something about how it runs in the family. He believed I actually did see it (After all, what are the odds of guessing? Probably a billion to one).

I remember I had the dream in the morning, probably at the exact time he was driving to work. So I think I dreamed of the event as it was happening. Like I said, I don't remember if I was a passenger or driving. So it's possible my dream self was even in the car with him while it happened.
I don't see it as a premonition, because I think I dreamed it -while- it was happening, maybe even after.

Do you guys think this is a glitch? There's no way it could have been a coincidence, I was baffled at the time. There's no logical explanation for it so I have to jump straight to paranormal.
I've told this story to a few friends and they don't have much to say over it. I frequently have bizarre dreams about other worlds, being other people, etc. So they've heard it all.

Also, why would I have such an amazing experience over something so random? More profound events have happened in my life. My dad's tire falling off wasn't interesting or exciting.

Two years ago after recently moving to Florida I had a friend I grew very close to. We would be comfortable sharing some dark secrets with each other and me and him were both big paranormal freaks so it worked out. 

Well, one weekend he came over to my house and after a while we decided to go into the woods. There is this trail it's a little walk diagonal from where I lived and it was next to a YMCA gym. So on our walk there we ended up starting to talk about paranormal stuff. About a minute into the woods while we were talking about that, without a word, he started running. Cause we were both starting to get creeped out with what we were saying he was trying to prank me. So this is what happens.

As I was running behind him for a second he didn't even look back so I planned to scare him so I see this bushy looking area with tall grass and I jump into it before he stops and turns around to come look for me. So I sit there crouched, and he starts walking back and a little bit before he comes to my bush he says, ""You can stop hiding now, I know where you are, I can see you."" I don't know why but I say it out loud cause I felt he wouldn't figure out where I was from my voice so I yell out, ""Where am I?"" So what he does is looks straight into the middle of the woods and points and moves his finger as if he was pointing at me while I was running. 

I was confused so I say ""Dude?"" and step out from where I was. He stood still for a second and he sprinted all the way to my apartment without saying anything I just followed him. As soon as we went into my room I had asked him what had happened and he told me that he had seen me. He said that he saw me running trying to hide from him and whenever I had stepped out he went pale because he ended up seeing another me running even though I was sitting behind a bush the entire time.

That led to a conversation about doppelgangers and parallel universes etc... until this day I don't really know what that was but it freaks me out and I'm sure it freaks him out too. We haven't talked about it since.

My dad was having a minor surgery on his foot yesterday, so I was going to be his ride to and from the hospital. When we got there, he was told the doctor was running around a half hour late, so he told me just to head home and he would call me when to return. So I left and came back about an hour later. His operation was on the fourth floor, so I took the elevator up, but as I exited, I suddenly realized that this wasn't the right place, so I headed back into the elevator. Maybe I had just mixed up the floors? I tried floor 5, nope. Floor 6, no, etc. It had to be on floor 4, maybe I had just forgotten what it looked like when I got out of the elevator. So I headed to floor 4 again, but this time the doors opened to an entirely different level that I instantly remembered that my dad was on.

After my dad had gotten out of surgery, we decided to pick up lunch at a Pizza Hut that was located in a Target store. I got it to go so we could eat at home. When we arrived at home, I immediately took the pizzas out of the bag and crumpled the bag up to put in the recycling, but as I crumpled it up, I felt something still in the bag. I reached in and pulled out a piece of paper. I unfolded it, and realized it was a page of questions that I had received at a job interview weeks earlier. I hadn't got the job and distinctly remembered tucking the paper away in my room somewhere, how had it gotten into this Target bag of all places? 

I've tried to figure out logical causes of these events, and it's possible that maybe I had not noticed what floor I was on and had hit the wrong floor, but I distinctly remember it being the fourth floor.

In my 2nd/3rd/4th grade class, we would take field trips every year. One year, we were doing a sort of ""rural west"" tour and we spent the night in this little high school gym.  We stayed on the wrestling room mats which were in this little area above the gym. It was like a really big balcony above the main gym/basketball court. I am sure of this layout because I actually have pictures from the trip that show it.  I was in the 3rd grade at the time, and I remember waking up really early in the morning to a strange noise from the floor below. I woke up my friend next to me and we looked to the gym to see someone in a full pink bunny suit running laps.  This continued for a few minutes, and then the bunny just ran right out.  We went back to sleep, and at breakfast we told our teachers. They asked the school, and they said that the entire school had been locked and there is no way anyone could have gotten in without setting off the alarm.

Keep in mind, there was around a ten minute interval between first seeing the cop car, getting Taco Bell and heading back home. So I go back down the same road to get home. On my way I see the exact cop car pull out of a hidden spot in the road. He has his lights on getting ready to pull someone over. I figured he's trying to stay busy tonight and getting things done.

As I go down the road more, he's in the exact same spot I saw the first cop car, with the exact same car pulled over, standing in the exact same position he was when I saw it the first time. I know it wasn't just me who saw him pull out of the spot, because a car in front of me pulled off to the side thinking they were getting pulled over but he kept on going. I was baffled.

Maybe someone here has seen something similar.

Back when i was about 14 or so (I'm 22 now),I was hanging out with a friend, driving around our small neighborhood, killing time before we met up with some other friends. We got some weed and decided to park somewhere and smoke. We parked in this tiny deserted parking lot at the bottom of a hill that was owned by an apartment complex that was at the top. The parking lot was pretty obscured from the road by trees and there was only one small entrance. We parked and proceeded to get super duper stoned and sat in the car talking until it was time to go meet our friends. As we started driving out of the parking lot, i noticed something odd. In the middle of the small entrance was a green pole, about 4 feel tall, really skinny. It was like, bright emerald green. There were two thick white bands near the top, and on top of it was an emerald green diamond shape, kind of like the little overhead bobble from The Sims, that looked like it was glowing. I remember thinking we were going to hit it with our car, but I was too stoned, and it happened too fast to say anything. Just as we were about to make contact with it, we didn't. Without a word, my friend slammed on the brakes. It wasn't there. He turned and looked at me and I knew that he had seen it too. We both described it to each other in perfect detail. We kins of freaked out about it for a bit and then never really spoke about it again, save for once or twice over the years. The story has come up in conversation from time to time but nobody has ever heard of anything like it. Despite how long it's been, and my impaired state at the time, I am 1,000% positive of what we saw, and can still remember in extremely vivid detail exactly how it looked.

Among it is the box of an old piece of some kind of software, called CodeWarrior. Attached to it was a note that said ""Can't be thrown away. Try it.""

Since it, unlike everything else in the box, had no discernible purpose or story behind it, I threw it away. Two days later it was sitting in the basement of my building, outside the trash room. Just sitting in the hallway.

I tried to throw it away again, and the next day someone in the lounge had it, saying they had used that software when they were really little and they had seen it in the trash and saved it for nostalgia value.

The last two historians told me roughly the same story. It's apparently been thrown away about 7 times over the last three years, including my attempts.

I removed the note from it, and replaced it with something along the lines of ""this box is our loyal pet,"" because I just find it so fascinating and it would be really sad if it actually got thrown away for real one day.

In the morning, I texted her, like normal, telling her what time I was going to be there. She replied to say ""yeah that's cool"", or whatever.

I get back this text message that says something like, ""You must have the wrong number. Sorry, I don't know what you're talking about."" I'm really confused, so I call Kathleen. 

Some totally random lady named Joan answers. I ask if this is Kathleen's phone and she says she has no idea who that is. The lady is totally nonchalant about it and it kind of creeps me out a little bit. 

I couldn't have gotten the number wrong because I didn't manually dial it, I simply used the same entry under Kathleen's name that I always use. I asked Kathleen later if anyone else has ever gotten ""Joan"" when they try to call her. She said no one has ever said anything.

It's a Casio Pathfinder, so it's tough and durable. I never take it off while playing sports, doing things outdoors, I never take if off in the shower, I don't take it off to sleep. It lives on my arm.

So I went to sleep last night, wearing my watch. Locked apartment, alone. 

I woke up at 2am, for no particular reason. Normally when I wake up in the middle of the night it's b/c i have to pee, or i'm burning hot (benefit of a high metabolism), or there was a super loud noise outside, something like that. Last night, I just woke up for no particular reason. As I rolled over to go back to sleep, I noticed that my watch was gone. This, of course, is odd since I had it when i went to sleep and never take it off. 

I figured I must have somehow taken it off in my sleep (which would have been weird enough), so I got up, turned on the lights, tossed the sheets, and it was nowhere to be found. I double checked the bed, the pillows, underneath the bed, every square inch of floor, and everywhere else. I did a quick walk around the house... doors still locked, nothing amiss. I've since checked the whole house for the watch, and it's just *gone*. 

I'm at a loss. seems unlikely someone would have snuck into my house (hard enough to do - i live on the 3rd floor of an apt building, and have crazy triple deadbolt locks and reinforced doors), taken my watch off my wrist, and snuck back out without disturbing or taking anything else. 

Maybe it teleported back to it's home planet, having collected all the data it needed....

When my grandmother was still alive, we would always stay at the same Holiday Inn every time we visited. We visited at least twice a year,  so this hotel was almost as much of a part of my childhood as my grandma's actual house was. Well this hotel had an indoor pool that we would hit up almost every day during our stays, and one time, just one time, when I swam down to touch the drain ( just something you do as a kid in pools) I didn't have to come back up. I swam down to the bottom, and started exhaling so that the buoyancy of my lungs wouldn't make my float back up instantly, just like I always did. And then I stayed down. I was at least 9, and I was an imaginative kid, but not the sort who would confuse real life with daydreaming, especially not enough to tell my parents about some fantasy. I just stayed down, and I don't remember why I started 'breathing' underwater but I did, and it worked. I remember hovering above the drain being extremely confused, and then I started exploring my new superpower. I swam from the deep end to the shallow and back, cruised the sloping edges on the corners, and found more pennies than I had ever imagined were in that pool. After coming up with a handfull of coins I climbed out of the pool, and ran to tell my mother what was happening. After she put down her romance novel, I jumped headfirst into the deep end, breathed out, and then almost drowned trying to replicate the experience I just had. Didn't work. I came up coughing and she went back reading pretty amused at my imagination.

I don't know what happened, but that experience and memory is as solid in my head as my driving test or my first pregnancy scare.

A teacher asked me to take the extra text books down to the basement.  I roll my cart down there and start unloading.  My back was to the door.  A man came in and started helping me unload.  We made small talk, and after we were done, he went back upstairs.  I went back up, and my teacher asked how I finished so quickly.  I told her about the man.  She said I had just described the campus cop, who happened to be out of town on that particular day.  Never came up with an explanation for that one.



I was 15, a freshman in high school, and my marching band went to Disney World for our end-of-year trip. While there, I bought a Mickey patch to put on my letter jacket. I lost it that day, and didn't buy a new one. I assumed I dropped it somewhere.  Flash-forward, about a year and a half later. I was sitting on the floor when I noticed a white thing on the floor.  I pick it up... it's my Mickey patch.  I still have it, it's on my letter jacket.



The summer between freshman and sophomore year, I went to band camp (and no, I did not insert a flute into my vajay-jay).  I had a ring I would wear every day, but one day I took it off.  I'm not sure why, I just decided not to wear it and to leave it on the desk.  That night, it was gone and no amount of searching could turn it up.  I left band camp, and gradually forgot about the ring.  Now would be the time to mention that at the time, I could not drive, nor did I have a car.  Later that year, when I actually had a car, I was cleaning it out.  I pulled out one of the floor-mats and lo and behold, my ring was sitting right in the center of it.



Last year, I was sitting in my living room, home alone.  Being home alone doesn't bother me.  It never has, and I usually prefer it.  From where I was sitting, I couldn't see the kitchen.  I heard what sounded like a lot of pots falling out of the cabinet.  I automatically assumed my dogs had gotten into the cabinet.  I went to go check.  All of the cabinets were closed, and there were no pots on the floor.  I shrugged it off as my imagination and went back into the living room.  I turned on the T.V.  I watched for a few minutes and heard someone talking that wasn't coming from the T.V.  I muted the T.V. and the voice went on for a split second longer.  I hauled ass out of there and went to my friend's house.



Last one, I promise!  This happened yesterday.  I came home from school and suddenly felt really tired.  I fell asleep and woke up a few hours later.  I looked at my clock and it said 7:29 P.M.  I didn't feel like getting up just yet so I rolled over, but didn't go to sleep.  I just lied there and pondered.  At least twenty minutes passed.  I rolled back over to see what time it was.  The clock still said 7:29 P.M.



The End.



Tl;dr -- I've had a few unexplained occurrences in my life.  Lots of fun.

  One of the questions I very clearly remember filling out is blank.  
  It was really clear, in it's completion, because it was right before a question that was answered in sentence on the sheet, rather than Scantron. This meant there was to be a blank question on the Scantron sheet for that one. The one before it was the question in...question.  
  I could have *sworn* I filled it out. I filled it out again, but I absolutely was positive that I had done it already. It wouldn't have made sense for me to fill out the whole Scantron, after looking everything over, to leave one blank.

I have recently seen a few posts about an item that is there, and then not. So I thought I would share my theory with you.

What if reality shifts in the time continuum are not just a local phenomenon but more so controlled by something, or someone. What if there is a being that exists in a time frame slower or faster than us to the point of being unseen. These theoretical beings I have named ""Time Gremlins"" and they interact with your objects. Be it that they are trying to communicate with us, control our fates or simply get a laugh, they control time. They don't control how time moves but they control how they move within it. Often you will place you car keys down in a spot and they vanish, for minutes at a time. You spend this time loosing your mind over what happened, then they either appear right where you last put them or they get moved. Sometimes I think the Time Gremlins move the items to delay your progress, either for malicious purpose or to help you. Sometimes your delay will cause you to come upon an intersection with a car crash in it, that could have been you, but the Time Gremlins saved you allowing another person fate to meet that incident. But sometimes that delay will cause you to be late, causing you to be fired, those are the malicious Time Gremlins. Could there even be Time Gremlins that are at war with each other? Ones that help us move through time and ones that want us to crash and burn. We will never know until we catch one, but until then, when an item comes up missing, ask them to return it. You'll be surprised at the result. I think Time Gremlins create false glitches, more so like a virus in the matrix.",,False,,t5_2tcwa,False,,,True,t3_12eipi,http://www.reddit.com/r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix/comments/12eipi/time_gremlins/,

This weekend, I'm at a small house party that everybody's just showing up to. To cut to the chase, I'm standing in the middle of the area everyone is moving through. I feel an itch on my ankle above my shoe, bend over pull up my pant leg to scratch, and there's dried blood/ red stain on my sock there.
 I didn't think anything of it, i figured i had got an un-noticed cut or scrape skateboarding earlier that day; happens all the time. I notice someone trying to get around me and look up to see them looking directly at the red stain, then make eye contact with me as if to say ""what's up with that bro?""
 Fast forward to maybe half an hour later, i get the same itch. Only this time when i lift my pant leg there's no red stain. Anywhere on that sock. I brought it up to my buddies at the party with me, who didn't really have any interest. I know that stain was there, I know that guy looked directly at it, and I know i wasn't there at all later.

This began 2 weeks ago, when for three consecutive days, I randomly took a peak at my phone and the time was 17:17. As a practical guy and someone who doesn't believe in things supernatural, conspirative or paranormal, I shrugged it off and continued my everyday being. 

One day after the case with my phone's clock, I am getting into my car, I checked how much gas I had and suddenly noticed that the mileage of the car was 177077. I also have another mileage meter that can be used if you want to measure the distance from point A to point B for example. It had been re-set exacly 77.1 km ago. I took a picture which I can upload if you want.

The weekend had passed, it's Monday and I am at work. I pull out my phone to see whats the time and I see again 17:17h. Same thing happened for the past 2 days also. And I am pretty sure I am checked the time on the on the most random basis there could be. 

Again, one day after the second encounter with my phone's clock, I am getting in my car and I am witnessing the same thing that happened exacly one week (7 days) ago. My car's mileage was 177177km with the second meter being reset 177.7km ago.

I am pretty sure that maybe this is a coincidence and nothing to worry about. But has it happened to anyone of you?

I was about 7, and me, my father, and my 10 year old sister went to a lake home for a bit in the summer. While there, we befriended a boy around my sister's age... Don't remember his name, it was ages ago.

Anyway, he mentioned that the creepy-looking house across the street and down a house or two, which was evidently empty (and in pretty ransack condition) was ""evil"" or had ""ghosts"" or some such. I didn't really believe in such things at that age, but I played along with it.

Going on, he mentions how in order to ""disable the evil"" of the house we had to flip the transformer / power supply switch out in front of the house. I didn't really get it and thought we'd get in trouble for messing with that stuff, but again, being a young boy, I went along with it. However, he warned us; After flipping the switch we had to run back up to his treehouse or we'd be turned to stone!

So we sneakily go up to it, me mostly hanging back, sister + him flip the switch and we take off running wildly back to his treehouse. We climb up in there and are panting catching our breaths, laughing a bit at the situation, when I noticed something.

I hadn't scraped my foot or cut it or anything but it started to bleed, as if a few separate cuts had struck it here and there. They just started forming. I freaked out a bit and they did too, but as we ran inside to get band-aids to fix the cuts, between leaving the house and walking in, they stopped appearing. 

Anyway... Might've been more a story for /r/creepy but I only thought about it as a not a ghost sort of thing but just a *weird* thing that happened. ""Electromagnetic force field"" around a house or something and flipping a switch...

About 15 years ago, I bought a copy of The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy.  It was the hardcover trilogy in five parts edition.  When I got the book home, the first thing I did was remove the flimsy jacket and put it aside because they annoy me.  What I found underneath cracked me up.  The book had been bound improperly.  The title printed on the spine was upside down, so you look really silly when you read the book in public.  I thought this was great, fitting with the silliness of the contents, and I had thought to myself that I should try to get the book signed.  Unfortunately, Douglas Adams passed away and I never got the chance to do that.  But I treasured my weird copy of the book and would show friends who were Adams fans over the years and we'd get a laugh from it.  

One thing annoyed me about the book though; there was a small scrape down the spine which I figured was made from a careless employee opening the box of books.  My book must have been on top and the knife used to cut the box open must have cut too far.  I checked the paper covering, and sure enough the slit was through that as well.  But I quickly got over this and accepted it as another of my book's quirks.

Well the book wound up on my bookshelf collecting dust over time as books do between readings.  Just this past week, I thought to myself I really ought to reread it because it's been so long.  So I go to my shelf and grab the book.  I flip it upside down and open it... and the writing is upside down now.  I am very confused.  I recheck the spine, and I can tell it looks different than I remember.  There is no knife slit in the spine, and it is no longer bound upside down.  It's just a normal Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy, bound properly.  I have multiple people who can vouch for this book being bound upside down at one point.

The only explanation I can think of is that for some reason, someone stole my book and replaced it with a normal copy, but who would do that?  I don't allow my friends access to my belongings in my house when I'm not around, so I don't know how they would even get the chance to do something like this anyways.  I've never lent the book out.  Nothing else is missing and there are no signs of my bookshelf being disturbed.  I don't think someone is playing a joke on me, because it's so out of the blue and I never told anyone that I was planning on rereading the book.  It just doesn't make sense to me.",,False,,t5_2tcwa,False,,,True,t3_1jthtq,http://www.reddit.com/r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix/comments/1jthtq/strange_book_swap/,
