1353929132.0,335,self.Israel,13t3xf,Palestinian here: I wish one day the Arab world gets as little as 10% of the criticism Israel gets for atrocities committed towards Palestinians.,490,155,116,http://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/13t3xf/palestinian_here_i_wish_one_day_the_arab_world/,"Considering the success of my last [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/13chp2/palestinian_here_hear_me_out_youll_probably_like/), I thought of doing a new post about how Palestinians have been treated throughout the Arab world. I'm sure most of this information is new to you considering the considerable lack of media reporting on the issue. FYI, I'm a Palestinian refugee from Lebanon. Here's the [proof](http://imgur.com/7DcO8).

Let me start with a couple of countries:

**Lebanon**

Around half of the 400,000 refugees live in camps, deprived of many rights. Refugees don't have any property rights, no access to the Lebanese healthcare system and there are certain restrictions on jobs we are allowed to do. We are issued handwritten [travel documents](www.passport-collector.com/2011/08/10/lebanon-refugee-passport-for-palestine/) of appalling quality (large size, cheap paper). The travel documents don't even have a full date of birth, just the birth year. You probably know about the Sabra and Chatila massacre (from the movie Waltz with Bashir, perhaps my favorite animated movie) were 3000 Palestinian civilians were killed in cold blood. These are at the top of my head, I'm sure there's more. This is what a British MP Gerald Kaufman said in 2011 when he visited the camps:

&gt;When I went to Gaza in 2010 I thought I had seen the worst that could be seen of the appalling predicament of Palestinians living in conditions which no human being should be expected to endure. But what I saw in the camps in Lebanon is far worse and far more hopeless. The conditions are unspeakable, but for over 400,000 of our fellow human beings this is their life: today, tomorrow and for a future that cannot even be foreseen. At least in Gaza, frightful though the situation is, the people are free within the confines of their blockaded prison. In the camps of Lebanon they are not free.

**Syria**

Surprisingly, refugees there are treated quite well, almost like a citizen. Although this is changing and the Palestinians are being forced to choose sides in the Syrian uprising.

**Jordan**

It's the only country that naturalized Palestinians after the annexation of the West Bank, perhaps because they needed the population back then. From what I know from my family members living there, there's some discrimination between the natives and Palestinians, but it's minimal compared to other Arab countries.

**Kuwait**

Kuwait [expelled](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_expulsion_from_Kuwait) more than 450,000 Palestinians when Arafat declared his support for Saddam during the Gulf war.

**Iraq**

Palestinians enjoyed full rights under Saddam's reign, however after the 2003 war they were severely targeted with discrimination or killings and the majority fled the country.

**Egypt**

You can read [this](http://www.fmreview.org/sites/fmr/files/FMRdownloads/en/FMRpdfs/FMR20/FMR2013.pdf) report here. Not only are they discriminated against (no free education) but they receive no UN assistance whatsoever. If they go out of the country for more than 6 months, their residency permit might be revoked. Imagine being born and living in a country your whole life and needing to renew your residency permit every couple of years. Also, a little bit about the occupation of the Gaza strip by Egypt, one observer (a member of UN) noted that ""For all practical purposes it would be true to say that for the last six years in Gaza over 300,000 poverty stricken people have been physically confined to an area the size of a large city park.""

-----------

I'm sure there's more but these are off the top of my head. Also, for a Palestinian refugee it's very hard nowadays to get a work visa to Gulf countries. I was accepted for an internship in Dubai for an American bank but I waited for the visa for 1 and a half months and it never came. I had to relocate to another office. This isn't anecdotal evidence, many complain about this.

Moral of the story: Israel naturalized over 1.5 million Palestinians. They enjoy full citizen rights and many of them would remain in Israel even if a Palestinian state is established. Palestinians in the Arab world on the other hand suffer from discernible and vile discrimination. If a non-Palestinian Arab speaks of the maltreatment of Palestinians by Israelis, tell them to STFU and demand rights for Palestinians in their countries before they complain about Israel. People living glass houses shouldn't throw stones.

I say this just in case the occasion arises, you can say for a certainty there's at least one of us.  
  
Silliness aside though, I have a couple of questions for you guys:   
(1) I'll preface the question by saying that I personally don't think a two-state solution would work. I won't get into the details of my opinion since it's beside the point, but I will say that I believe Jews have every right to live in Israel. That said, I was wondering what you guys think about the idea of Palestinians being integrated into Israeli society. By this I mean as a people and a culture, assuming they were willing to co-habit with Israelis peacefully as neighbors and co-workers, do you think Israeli society would embrace them? Or would the majority of Israeli society want Palestinians separate from them in their own areas frequenting their own establishments?  
  
(2) I was also wondering if any of you knew of a good book that attempts to be unbiased and narrates the history of the Israeli-Palestinian lands over the centuries. Sadly, I only have bits and pieces of information on the history of the area even though it's central to our lives, but would like to remedy my lack of knowledge.  
  
Thanks guys. If you've got any questions for me I'd be happy to answer.  
  
**Edit:** Thank you all so much for all these reading/viewing suggestions. Once the suggestions end I'll make a list and look into everything. This is great!  
Oh, and thank you also for a very civilized discussion. I'm thoroughly enjoying it.

What I do know that having rockets thrown at you is scary as hell. I'm liking the direction this war/conflict is taking. ~~There hasn't been many Palestinian causalities so far~~, and I'm loving the Iron dome (hopefully you will one day develop the technology that can stop every rocket). Hopefully it stays this way and doesn't get any bloodier. Also, I hope the IDF won't do half a job and perhaps take over Gaza again, I think Israel did a mistake giving it back...

Anyways, why do I as a Palestinian share this opinion? Well, I'm sick of all this. I truly am. Sure Palestinians voted for Hamas, but had they known the suffering Gazans had to endure, they probably wouldn't have voted for hamas. Besides, it's not like Hamas benefited Palestinians in any way in the past years. Israel initiated the blockade on Gaza, Hamas made tunnels that's now controlled by them (like a mafia). See what I hate about this situation is the status quo, if Israel leaves Hamas alone, Gaza would remain under blockade for many years to come, and Hamas would still control tunnels using taxes earned to get rich or send of a couple of rockets every month to Israel as a sign of 'resistance'. Perhaps getting rid of Hamas and taking control of Gaza might get us closer to peace.

I know the majority of Israelis want peace, but sadly you're government is controlled by extremists as well, when they continue to expand settlements. I just hope I'll be able to see peace between us before I die (I'm 22 now, so hopefully there's time.

(U.S.-Israel relationship),193,56,100,http://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1460pt/can_we_just_get_something_straight_usisrael/,"Alright, I know that this subreddit for obvious reasons is mostly pro-Israel and won't argue that much with what I have to say, but I know some Israel haters lurk around here and I want them to hear me out. I just want to get some history and facts straight. 

As usual, r/worldnews is rampant with articles criticizing Israel (note how I didn't say ""anti-Israel"".) R/worldpolitics is an even bigger joke and is, in fact, anti-Israel. But that's not my point.

I browse r/worldnews. And I read and comment on every article regarding Israel. Now- I'm a liberal, a leftist, I criticize Israel when it needs to be criticized. I also defend Israel when it deserves to be defended, mostly against lies and slander. And I see something, **in every article's comments**, that bugs me so fucking much.

Every r/worldnews article about Israel has someone who simply comments, ""Why does the U.S. support this?""/""Why do we fund this kind of stuff""/every variation of the question essentially questioning the U.S.-Israel relationship. 

And to every question like that, which is found in every thread, there is a highly-upvoted comment saying, ""Evangelical Christian support, they believe the Jews need to be in the land for some religious prophecy.""

**FUCK THAT**. It is true that Christian Zionism exists and that evangelical/highly religious christians are generally pro-Israel. And yes, Christian leaders may donate to AIPAC or donate to Israel or whatnot, but **Christian Zionism is NOT the reason for the U.S. foreign policy towards Israel. Period.** The Evangelical Christian population is not big enough nor powerful enough to influence such a thing as foreign policy of the largest economy in the world. We only care about radical Christians when it comes to voting in swing states, and even then, these evangelicals care more about abortion and Obama ""being a darn muzzie"" than Israel.

Now, before I explain the *correct* explanation of U.S.-Israel relations (which is very simple), why do stupid comments claiming that U.S. support is rooted in Christian Zionism get upvoted? Because on reddit, a very liberal/young/atheist platform (as seen by the bias on r/politics and the popularity of r/atheism), it is easy to hate on religion (and as a liberal I understand this). Christian radicals, in general, suck, and reddit feeds on that. All r/atheism does is make fun of fundamentalist Christians, point out flaws in Bible or religious logic, or post FB pictures of statuses by fundies. There is never an actual discussion of atheist philosophies on r/atheism, and yes it is one of the most popular subreddits. We get it- radical Christians are stupid, ignorant, dismiss logic and are full of hatred towards those who are different, etc. It is very easy to hate on radical christians when you are young and a liberal.

So hating on Israel becomes *THAT* much easier when you view Israel as a project funded/created by radical Christian ideals. You view Jewish Israelis as white people who don't belong in the Middle East but took over the land because ""God promised them the land"", and to you, a young liberal browsing reddit, that seems like the stupidest shit ever, because, you know, the Bible is totally false, man. 

What is the **real** reason for current U.S.-Israel relations? It is simply strategic. The U.S. didn't give two shits about Israel until 1956. Until then, Israel got its weapons from Czechoslovakia. After the Sinai Campaign, the Cold War between the U.S. and Russia was in full swing. The Russians decided to start investing/allying with the Arab countries (hence the communist-Arab bloc that exists in modern-day UN). The U.S., needing to counter the Russians in the Middle East in order to follow Truman's ""containment"" policy, invested in Israel which was seen as a worthy investment after the Sinai Campaign.

**Israel and the Arab countries fought the ""Hot"" wars in the Middle East for the Americans and Russians, respectively, fighting the Cold War.** 

That is the beginning of U.S.-Israel relationships. Russia supplied Syria, Lebanon, and Egypt with Russian military technology and strategy, and the U.S. did the same with American technology to Israel. Then Israel and Arab countries fought ACTUAL wars. Nixon, Reagan, and mostly Henry Kissinger under the Nixon/Ford administrations, supported Israel very strongly as a way to ""stick it"" to the Russians. 

In today's world, the answer is still simple. Strategy, again. America is leading the war on terror, and who is mini-America in a hostile region? Israel. Israel supplies intelligence, and fights terrorists that hate America as much as they hate Israel. 

I'm sorry for this long-ass rant, it's just that, as someone who has extensively researched the history of the region, it irritates me like no other to see ""The U.S. supports Israel because the U.S. is full of backwards Christian fundies"" get 49 upvotes. Or any other number. Because it's false.

According to the complaint submitted, the owner of the hut (and surrounding animal enclosures that were destroyed) showed the officer that they had a document from Israel's High Court of Justice allowing him 60 days to approach the High Court before the demolition. The officer ripped it up and went forward anyway. The owner said he prevented more destruction with a hasty call to the Prosecutor's office. To me, this seems like Israel's justice system did not allow it, and the army went ahead anyway.

Now, onto solar panels, the article discusses how the European Union feels about their money and projects going to waste, and the immorality of the situation, saying that the UN has recorded 342 demolitions. Israel promised to ""look into it"", but never went through on their word.

The Civil Administration, which is in charge of construction in Israel, said that the construction of solar panels were illegal, and the plans the Palestinian residents submitted was rejected by the planning committee (doesn't say why). They also said the complaints against the officer were being investigated.

A complaint was submitted that settler are moving into Area B, Palestinian-controlled land, illegally. The Civil Administartion has not responded, and the Israeli High Court gives them 7 days to respond or action will be taken.

Another edit: The Guardian article right now on the front page believes that permits are hard to come by because of all the demolishing of Palestinian structures, and all of the building of Israeli ones. How does that prove how many permits have been rejected? Maybe the Palestinians simply do not apply, since they believe they will not be accepted, or because they don't accept Israeli authority! We have no evidence to support any conclusion about permits here.",,False,self,t5_2qhvo,True,,,True,t3_qw25y,http://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/qw25y/rworldnews_claims_we_are_discussing_it_so_lets/,

Edit: Our definition of an anti-zionist apparently isn't clear. I believe the spectrum of the word falls into the same category as identifying yourself as a Democrat, Republican, Jew or Christian. There is a large spectrum of differering beliefs in each. Just as there is John McCain, and Rick Santorum who both consider themselves Republicans, there are anti-zionists who simply use the identification to show they oppose certain policies that Israel implements towards the Palestinians, others wish for the dismantaling of the state. The later does teeter on anti-semetism, but the difference remains and until you hear blatant racist statments against Jews as a race, stop slapping the word anti-semite on someone simply because they oppose Israel's policies.

Correct behavior in the face of daily threats saves lives!

**How to recognize an event?**

When you hear an alert siren, a sound of an explosion or a “Tzeva Adom” warning.

**How to prepare your home and family.**

Due to the short warning time, it is important to establish in advance where you are going to take shelter during a rocket attack. As the first priority, choose a MAMAD (apartment protected space) or a private bomb shelter. If no MAMAD or private shelter are available, choose a protected room which complies with the Home Front Command guidelines. Make sure all members of the household are familiar with your chosen protected space. It is important to select a protected space at any location you spend time in, to perform family preparations and to prepare an emergency bag. The protected space must be equipped according to the guidelines.

**The threat**

The main threat against the Israeli home front is from rocket and mortar attacks.
On the eve of the Gulf War, many countries discovered that the war has expanded from the front lines to the civilian rear.

The IDF Home Front Command have developed guidelines for the residents’ behavior upon hearing the sound of an alarm or an explosion. Compliance with these instructions will significantly reduce any damage that may be caused by a rocket or mortar attack against the Israeli home front.

**How to behave during an event?**

**If you are indoors:**

Enter the MAMAD immediately and close the steel window shutter.

**In the absence of a MAMAD:**

Enter the room farthest from the direction of the threat, with the smallest possible number of outside walls, windows and openings;

Close the door and the windows;

Sit on the floor (below the windowsill level) and lean against an interior wall. Do not sit in front of windows;

Upper story residents in a building with no MAMAD, are required to exit to the staircase and descend one floor down. A protected room can be a staircase or a corridor (provided they comply with the above conditions more than other rooms in the house).
 
**If you are outdoors:**

In a built-up area – enter the nearest building and act according to the instructions for persons taking shelter indoors;
In an exposed area – lie on the ground face-down and cover your head with your hands.
 
**If you are traveling:**

Stop by the side of the road, leave the vehicle and enter the nearest structure or cover. If you are unable to reach a structure or shelter within the given period of time, lie on the ground face-down and cover your head with your hands. If neither of the above instructions can be complied with, pull over and remain inside the vehicle for the next 10 minutes.
 
**Following the event:**

After 10 minutes, you may leave the protected area, unless another otherwise instructed. Stay clear of unidentified objects. Should you see a rocket lying on the ground, prevent gathering of bystanders and inform the security forces.

I just would like to have an open, honest chat. English is my second language, and I try my best to be as articulate and punctual as I can, but if you think that I said something offensive, One: Absolutely I did not mean to offend anyone, Two: Please let me know so I can explain myself and would make a mental note so that I would not repeat the same mistake again. 

A little about me: I am 34 male, an atheist, also completely detached from notions of nationalism, patriotism, culture-sm and all types of prejudice. I have no set-opinions which cannot be changed with evidence and/or merits of competing rationale. I welcome objections to my reasoning. I'd like to think that I have achieved full objectivity and would like to learn more about how and why you think what you think. I am from Turkey. 

My first question: Who do you think has the right to criticize Israeli policies, without getting labeled as an antisemitic or Jew-hating-jew (other than Israeli citizens)

**EDIT:** The validity of using antisemitic label for political reasons is challenged by Starl1te with this citation [The Big New Lie: That Critics of Israel Are Being Labeled Anti-Semitic](http://www.alandershowitz.com/publications/docs/bignewlie.html) Therefore, until further research I will not presume the legitimacy of this statement.


**EDIT CONT:**It appears to be the biggest problem with antisemitic accusations derives from various  interpretations of it's meaning by different pro-Israeli groups.  They range from, *Hatred or discrimination against Jews to Anybody who is critical of Israel, 3Ds to New antisemitism and Jewish conspiracy theories to Religious antisemitism ... and then some*.  Some interpretations of antisemitism defines legitimate criticism widely and demonizes narrowly while other descriptions defines legitimate criticism too narrowly and demonizes too broadly. I think this situation what really blurs the distinction between legitimate criticism of Israel and antisemitism.
""*The Big New Lie: That Critics of Israel Are Being Labeled Anti-Semitic*"" bases it's point from a specific antisemitic definition and does not acknowledge that critics might have been accused of antisemitism based on different definitions of the concept. Under these circumstances, my question; ""*Who do you think has the right to criticize Israeli policies, without getting labeled as an antisemitic or Jew-hating-jew*"" which presumes that there is a generally accepted notion of what constitutes an antisemitism, becomes irrelevant as the the answer depends on who you talk to. However, it does not invalidate the notion that antisemitic accusations abused as a form of suppression of criticism by those who base their claim to a broadly demonized interpretation of antisemitism.


**EDIT2:** **This thread really turned into a breath of fresh air.** I thank all who participated in it. You have been gracious hosts. I sincerely hope to do it again.  ",,False,self,t5_2qhvo,True,,,True,t3_mciw2,http://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/mciw2/an_honest_chat/,

Iranians and Israelis are very similar in many ways with exception to government, the Israeli government is obviously superior. Iranians and Israelis are secular people despite Iran having a non-secular government. Also, I have always felt that despite we Iranians being Indo-European and you Israelis being ""Semitic"" that we do look similar, I think this is because most Israelis have European blood. There is also a big parallel I see between Iranian and Israeli society, that Orthodox Jews and in Iran's case Mullahs, are the hated class of society, seen as leeches and parasites by the people. Israel is an amazing country, I would love to visit some day!

* Death of an Arab prisoner was blamed on Israel, [250 points](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/194qe5/around_3000_palestinian_prisoners_refuse_food/) in worldnews. And, it was [a falsification](http://www.timesofisrael.com/preliminary-autopsy-finds-no-signs-of-violence-on-palestinian-inmates-body/). When an [Arab inmate](http://maannews.net/ENG/ViewDetails.aspx?ID=570413) died in Arab custody around the same time, no uproar followed, no mass protests and demands for international investigations were found. [That's normal, though](http://elderofziyon.blogspot.co.il/2011/12/palestinian-arabs-fabricating-facts-on.html)
* ""Apartheid buses"", [2500 points](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/19kna6/israel_introduces_palestinian_only_bus_lines/) in /r/worldnews, [which turned out to be nothing of the sort](http://cifwatch.com/2013/03/06/the-factual-and-logical-failures-behind-accusations-of-racist-israeli-bus-lines/). And when these buses were [torched](http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4352433,00.html), it was most certainly not the Arab labourers who did that.
* Forced sterilization of ethiopian women, [1000 points in worldnews](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/17conm/israel_admits_ethiopian_women_were_given_birth/), but we [knew it was a lie then](http://elderofziyon.blogspot.co.il/2013/01/did-israelis-force-contraception-on.html), and Haaretz has [finally admitted it](http://www.tabletmag.com/scroll/126486/haaretz-corrects-forced-contraception-story#undefined), and of course, no retraction ever made it to /r/worldnews frontpage.

Then you have dozens of minor things, like a soldier's ID being ""found"" next to torched Arab cars, which later turns out to be done by Arabs themselves, and we have world's biggest hypocrite Erdogan et cetera ad infinitum.

And if we go into 2012, then we have the same story about the ""apartheid poll"", and so on and on and on.

So, we're doing as usual.

I was raised in Egypt with the mindset that Israel is our sworn enemy. I was bombarded by the media since childhood of images explicit and implicit of a good-vs-evil type relationship between the two countries, and you can guess who was the evil. One example that comes to mind is the Egyptian 'pocket books' series for youth called “Ragol El Mustaheel” or “Man of the Impossible” which was and still is immensely popular. This James Bond-type fiction is littered with overt anti-Israeli attitudes. Virtually all the Israeli characters in those books were sneaky, conniving, immoral, brutish villains willing to do ANYTHING to further their means. I must have read about 150+ of these books. This is in addition to other forms of media, teachers, and general public attitude when it comes to Israel resulting in a self-propagating brainwash wave. A sociologist/psychologist can provide a scientific opinion on this type phenomenon but that's my two-cents. It is so as-a-matter-of-fact in Egypt that I've never seen someone pose the question: Why is Israel the enemy?
 

Differentiating anti-Israeli/anti-Zionism from anti-Semitism is always tricky but I would say that what I experienced was mostly the former with a little bit of the latter. Anti-Semitism seemed to have been more popular with the religious. I'm sure this general anti-Israeli sentiment rampant in Egypt is evident in polls, and I know it to be true having lived in there and seen it first hand.
 

I propose that this is only the case because of non-rational, dogmatic behavior stemming from the Palestinian issue as I explain below. Israel is not Egypt's enemy unless Egypt makes it so and continues with this attitude creating a form of a self-fulfilling prophecy. 
 

The Palestinian question is not Egypt's problem, though in the recent history of war between Egypt &amp; Israel, you'll find the drivers to be related to that same issue. Why has Egypt cared more about the Palestinian issue than any other world crisis? There is obviously the proximity factor but why should Egypt take the Palestinian side? Objectively, the Palestinian issue is quite complicated historically, morally, and philosophically; having a virtually 100% population support for the Palestinian side is a clear indication that there is a bias. The question is why the bias to the Palestinians? Should we even be biased IF they are genetically closer to us? The answer is no. I am not sure if we are even genetically closer to the Palestinians but what we have in common linguistically and culturally for the most part is due to the Muslim conquests 1400 years ago or so. Unfortunately this 'new' Arab culture displaced a lot of the native Egyptian and Palestinian cultures and hence the commonality -however much that is- that we have now. Should we take sides with another country because we were invaded –and had our cultures somewhat overwritten- by the same people a few hundred years ago? That’s not reason enough for me.


Israel should not be an enemy; she's a neighbour and a potential friend. A healthy relationship between the two countries and people will be mutually beneficial. There are many things to be respected, learned, and shared about Israel, like many other countries with a rich history. I'm sure there are also a few shameful moments in its history, also like many other countries, including Egypt. And I don’t find those moments to be more frequent or severe with Israel than anyone else. 


In fact, Egypt does not need new enemies, period. Creating enemies for no reason when you have substantial issues like corruption, illiteracy, population, and extremism to name a few, doesn't make sense one bit. Israel has shown the world some incredible achievements in a short amount of time and a small population. We need to get rid of our irrational bias so we can learn from this A-grade student. There is no doubt in my mind that more trade agreements, information exchange etc with Israel would help both countries. It's unfortunate when you make an enemy for the wrong reasons. It's ill-advised if they are permanently residing next door. And it's just plain stupid if you can help each other instead.

[According to Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_casualties_of_war) anywhere between 33,000 and 52,500 Palestinians have died from 1948 (the founding of Israel) to 2010 as a direct result of conflict. Compare that to the 10 million people who died as a direct result of the actions of the Nazi party.

Whether you think the Israeli government's actions are racially motivated or not, the fact remains that the numbers do not support a fair comparison between Nazi Germany and the Israeli government.

Second, let's take a look at how many Israeli's have died as a direct result of conflict with the Palestinians. [According to the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_casualties_of_war#Palestinian_violence) (I suppose you could take this with a grain of salt), 3,000 Israeli's have died from Palestinian action and terrorist attacks. Let's compare that to all of the Nazis that were killed by terrorist attacks.

Zero.*

*I do not have an accurate number of Nazi deaths at this time. It has been pointed out to me in the comments that many more died than zero, and so far the largest total I have been able to come up with is 50.** If anyone would like to give me a more accurate number, I would be very grateful.

**Okay, the total is now up to 3000. However, I am still having trouble finding a simple, concise number to use. If anyone could help, it would be greatly appreciated.

___________________________________________________

Now, before you shit all over me, I would like to point out that what the Israeli government is doing is *terrible*. However, comparisons to Nazi Germany are not only unfair, but they are deeply offensive to anyone who knows anything about the holocaust.

During only a few short years, *millions* of people killed in various ways (firing squad, gas chambers, starvation, torture) by the Nazi regime. So many dead bodies were burned at times that the sky was thick with ash as if it were snowing. Think about that for a second - your kids go out to play in the freshly fallen snow, only to find out it is the burned remains of human bodies.

Millions were tortured to death in concentration camps - they could not have medicine, only were given a minimum amount of food (often rotted), experimented on, and used for slave labor. There was even a case of one Jew's skin being made into a *lampshade*.

And you think that you can even *begin* to compare what the Israeli government is doing to [this](http://sztybel.tripod.com/05_nazi_lampshade.jpg)? [NSFW]

Fucking stop it. It may be fashionable and the irony may be hard to resist, but the Israeli government has done nothing to even *begin* to compare to the horrors of Nazi Germany.",,False,self,t5_2qhvo,True,,,True,t3_eycfu,http://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/eycfu/dear_reddit_if_you_really_think_that_the_israeli/,

We went to the areas deemed unsafe, (H-1, where it is illegal for Israelis to go). I saw the other side, a Palestinian viewpoint, the Palestinian propaganda which I have never even had a chance to be exposed to, and I must say, it is very powerful.

I met Issa Amro, a man labeled a terrorist (Proof of terrorist) http://blogs.jpost.com/content/fun-and-games-issa-amru-hebron, though his telling of the story is very different, as he says he is a completely peaceful, non-violent protestor.

While in the area, I asked very little, but listened a lot. When I met this man, he asked me to ask him questions, so I asked him 2.

Why did the people of the West Bank and Gaza elect Hamas? (not verbatim, but close) - The Palestinian Authority has been in power for many years, and the situation has only become worse. We live in a military state, more homes are taken every day, and we do not have the simple freedom to move from place to place. A trip to Ramallah used to take 20 minutes. Now, that same trip takes 2-3 hours. There are 4 checkpoints on the way, where they can hold me up to three hours (at each), and it has taken me 10 hours to travel there. All in all, under their leadership, they have not been able to improve our lives in the least. Hamas on the other hand, are great negotiators. Look at Gilad Shalit. They were able to take one captured soldier and exchange him for over 1000 captured patriots. While I do not agree with the methods they use, they are strategic and get things done. I can understand why the people voted them in. That being said, I did not vote for them.

What is the resolution? A 2-state solution, etc.? There can be no 2-state solution, no compromise, no anything, while I have guns continuously pointed at my head. Israelis live under civil law, we here in the West Bank live under Israeli Military law. I cannot negotiate when I have nothing. I am oppressed, and Israel is the oppressor. How can a person in a giant jail negotiate for their freedom. Until we are given our basic rights, like freedom of privacy, speech, movement, and others, we can not begin to consider anything. (I, Daniel, view this as very similar to our duress laws. For instance, if I have a gun pointed at my head and I sign a contract, that contract is not legally enforceable.)
He spoke about much more, like the reason the walls have been put up, and in his eyes, to systematically take control of the area (even though it is illegal under international law - a quick interesting read that explains the basics on both sides, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_West_Bank_barrier).

What an AMAZING day. There was SOO much more that I saw, but I think this post is long enough.

I have heard the extremists on both sides, and I believe they both have valid points.

I thought maybe we can make a guide with as much information as we can gather: transportation, tourist attrections, pubs and bars, restaurants, hotels and apartments, safety, and more.

What do you think? 

Edit: So, I just pitched this idea at the middle of the night as it came to me. If there is interest [although I'm not sure how many people should count as enough to go through with it] we should decide how it's done. My idea was to put up a thread to decide what topics should we cover. The basic will probably be: behavior, transportation, night life and such. Then I thought we can have a new thread once a week [not to clog up the sub] where we will discuss one of the topics and compile as many advices and recommendations as possible. I am relatively new to reddit so I don't know if this will work, I wanna hear your opinions. Also I would like to get a green light from the mods but I'm not sure if I should contact them directly, at least until I'm sure people even want this. Of course, I would gladly handle all the work related [although I'd appreciate help] if we decided to do it.

Seeing the program become a reality has been incredibly rewarding. More importantly, those who participated in Seas of Peace have described the program as the experience of a lifetime that has the power to change the lives and minds of many. During their time at Seas of Peace, the participants discuss who they are, where they come from, and how conflict has affected their lives. In choosing such an isolated environment, the program challenges the students to truly engage with one another, offering them no choice with whom they interact. These interactions are essential to understanding and feeling understood.

I thought it might be interesting to anyone that wants to know more...
***
*The car*: The cars are [Renault Fluence](http://www.betterplace.com/the-company-multimedia-photos/index/id/72157623854339020) sedans, about the size of a Mazda 6 and cost about 120kILS, about the same as a Ford Focus or Mazda 3.  The interior is pretty decked out and for an extra 7000ILS you can get leather trim, etc.  It's quite posh for the money that you're paying.  The car has a built-in GPS that also directs you to battery-changing stations, plays MP3s, dials Better Place for assistance, and guides you through swapping batteries.  It runs silently and is about as powerful as a Mazda 3 but feels heavier.  There are hardly any moving parts under the hood so far less maintenance.  On the downside, the battery takes up about half of the trunk space.  Also, the car can phone home and report your location if needed: Not good if you're into tin foil hats.

*The battery*: It's the first car with a replaceable battery.  Usually you just charge overnight at a station that BP builds for you and a full charge takes 6 hours.  A full charge gets you about 150km.  There are currently about 10 stations around Israel and by the end of the year there should be 40.  They are placed so that you can reach anywhere, but you'll need to stop to swap batteries, only for long rides.  The swap is unmanned and takes 4 minutes.  The station picks up the car, levels it, then a hatch opens beneath the car and the battery is swapped from below.

*The energy*: It's more of a cell phone model: You buy kilometers/year, (20,000-55,000) and pay for those; they pay the energy bill.  If you go over your limit, you pay 0.9ILS per km, which is like 10% more than gas prices.  20,000km per year, for example, is 1090ILS per month.  You get a break if you buy 4 years in advance.  Also, until the stations are all up and running, half off on energy.  The downside here is that you're not getting the savings: You're paying about the same as what you'd pay for gasoline in terms of kilometers, but if you were to pay the energy costs directly to the electric company, it would be around 30% of the cost.  BP has to make a living, I guess.  Plus, you get the battery stations and road-side assistance and public charging stations.

*Financing*: They've worked out lots of deals with banks, insurance, etc, to make things easy.  Instead of paying up-front, you can pay 3200ILS/month for a new car plus an 80,000km-during-4-years package that includes the home charging station and everything.  People pay similar money for a company car but in this case, it's 4 years not 3 and at the end, you own a car!  Or for about 2400/month, you can get the same thing but at the end of it you owe 50kILS.  The idea here is to make it less expensive and at the end you sell the car and cover the 50kILS, probably with some money leftover.

I was most surprised that driving the car felt like driving a silent but otherwise normal car; I didn't have to re-learn how to drive.  Also, I was surprised that it can work out cheaper than a company car *and* the car is nicer!  But will people be willing to accept the inconvenience of stopping at stations for long drives only to break-even on the energy?  With a Prius you pay much more for the car but the savings in gas money are yours to keep; not so with BP.

&gt; The delegation justified their demand as a necessary defense against Muslim intolerance. As evidence, the Alawite notables cited the unjust treatment that the ""good Jews"" of Palestine were receiving. The Jews, their petition stated, ""scattered gold, and established prosperity in Palestine without harming anyone or taking anything by force, yet the Muslims declare holy war against them and never hesitated in slaughtering their women and children."" As a result, ""a dark fate awaits the Jews and other minorities"" when the Muslims would receive their independence.

I am a Jew and a zionist but am fully against any expansion into the land that will hopefully one day be part of a Palestinian nation. I think it is immoral and probably illegal. I want it to stop and I want most of what is built to be removed. I freely admit that I am probably not as knowledgable about the specifics of the situation, but what I do know just strikes me as wrong and immoral and I cannot support it. 

I do believe that up until the past 10 years or so, Israel truly did try to achieve peace, and while most people there still want it and would be favorable to a peace that involved the stopping of settlements and the return of land taken in '67 to a new palestinian state, that now the people in power of Israel are not interested in peace and see the delay of peace as beneficial because it allows more land to be ""grabbed"".

Now they'll argue that this sub reddit is for discussing all things Israel which may be true however if you look at the kind of comments such people make in posts, they clearly dislike Israel and it's clearly their intention to ""smear"" Israel for a lack of a better word - I dare say that this goes beyond ""constructive"".

I think we can (mostly) all agree that ""proper"" terrorism is Not Cool, by which I mean things like launching rockets, suicide (and other) bombings, murdering settlers, etc.

I also think that most of us think that violent but generally non-lethal things like throwing rocks (both at cars and at individuals) is pretty uncool, though I would put it on a very different level.

How, then, should a conscious, independence-minded Palestinian act towards that goal?  Simply keeping your head down and working towards economic prosperity may lead to peace and a better standard of living in Ramallah and Nablus, but in the current Israeli political environment, I personally believe that inaction by the Palestinians will lead to them slowly being choked by the settlements.

The Palestinian move of being recognized as a member of the UN was, in my opinion, kind of a waste of time.  The regular protests, where 10 Palestinians are accompanied by 20 foreign journalists, are starting to get annoying.  Violence, we've decided above, is mostly unacceptable.

So, what **can** be done?

Or, a better way to phrase it:

**As an Israeli or self-identifying pro-Israel individual, what forms of resistance do you feel are legitimate for Palestinians to use?**",,False,self,t5_2qhvo,False,,,True,t3_1bpvfr,http://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1bpvfr/how_to_resist_occupation/,

I'll provide both the original results and the fixed ones to show you a comparison. So the number of seats after the deduction of suspected ballot stuffing will appear in brackets.  
I also discounted blank votes, although they would have got the imaginary ""Blank Vote party"" 4 seats in the Knesset.    
Please note that I've rounded up the number of seats to the nearest whole number and have ignored agreements between parties for leftover votes (I don't know the intricacies of all the agreements).  
The seats are out of 120 Knesset seats, alphabetically:
  
Al'e Yarok - Hareshima Haliberalit: 10 (11)   
Ha'avoda: 12 (14)  
HaBayit Hayehudi 9 (10)  
Halikud Beitenu: 16 (13)  
Hatnu'a: 5 (6)  
Meretz: 28 (32)  
Otzma Leyisra'el: 22 (16)  
Shas: 8 (7)  
Yesh Atid: 10 (11)

What does it mean?  
Well, nothing - it's not really up to us.  
But if for some incomprehensible reason it was, it seems as if Zehava Gal'on (Meretz) would be prime minister, and there'd be a rather left leaning coalition.
I'll leave further political/social/financial/security analysis to you, my fellow redditors, as I must return to abandoned studies.  
But here is one possible outcome of such a government: 
Decriminilization of cannabis

Thanks for this, it's been fun.

2. What (if anything) do you want of the moderators? Currently, our main job is going through the spam queue to approve stuff that was deleted by the spambot, and go through the reports queue and approve the comments and submissions. Really the only stuff that's deleted is stuff that is outright offensive, antisemitic, racist or Islamophobic, occasionally banning some dude whose only posts involve those things.

In this case, it doesn't matter what your religous, political, cultural and any other views are. We must, as a country that is home to hundreds of Holocaust Survivors, continue to remember that this terrible thing happened, and to never let it happen again. One of the main ways to prevent such a thing from ever happening again is educating towards tolerance and respect, and by remembering the sad stories of the Holocaust, and the heroic stories like the Warsaw Ghetto Rebellion. So today and tommorow, take a moment to read something, watch something, listen to something- something to reflect upon on this important day of remembrance.

There are many, many stories of Survivors on the internet and in Israeli newspapers. You can also try Yad Vashem's website here: http://www.yadvashem.org/

Again, It doesn't matter who you are and what you think. The Holocaust is a constant and important part of our life as the Jewish People, no matter how you describe that controversial term. We have to remember that this happened, and why.",,False,self,t5_2qhvo,False,,,True,t3_1bukwo,http://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1bukwo/tommorow_is_holocaust_remembrance_day_do/,
