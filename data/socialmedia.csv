It looks like most of the submissions here are simply links to social media articles out there on the Internet, with little voting or actual discussion going on. These factors make it not-so-useful or engaging for me, and possibly others. I can find articles elsewhere, from sources that I know, trust, and subscribe to. Beyond a catchy title, I just don't see that as the best use for this subreddit. The low number of votes/activity also makes every submission somewhat unverified as quality content (but that in particular isn't really something we can solve). 

This isn't an insult to this community, subreddit, or the mods - not at all. I'd like this to be an awesome place, and am seeking to improve it. 

I'm a social media manager for a telecom company, and I'm guessing that others of you are also social media professionals. So let's have actual conversations, get some self-posts in here, and discuss what we do and the future of our landscape. Granted, this is a little hypocritical since I haven't really done this myself, but I'm just throwing it out there to see what your vision is for this place and where you think it's at. 

Make sense? Maybe I'm wrong, and that's fine, I'm a bit of a stranger here for sure. It's just that I can imagine some real increased value here that I know is possible. 

Fire away!



**EDIT: Even with just a few comments, I'm thinking that what I put above seems to be true. So, in any replies you make (reply again for all I care if you have already), mention something or a few things that you'd like to see, and then let's look at what that need is as a whole.

It goes into detail about how they view their social media efforts, and how they measure their social media ROI.

What’s important to remember though is that a measurable, financial social media ROI isn’t just being experienced by the big companies. It doesn’t take more than a quick Google search to find countless posts about small business owners who have reaped the rewards of building relationships through social media. This topic hits close to home for us because Bit Rebels wouldn’t exist as we know it today without social media. Social media has always been a very big part of what we do, and we’ve met many of our clients through our engagement in social media.

How do I approach this?,17,5,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/socialmedia/comments/i731r/i_have_this_lady_from_marketing_that_is/,"Little background :  I work 2 jobs, one in I.T and the other in an established chain of pubs as a barman.  In my spare time I'm working hard to revive my freelancing career.  In the pub I work the managers are trying to get my on board with their social media as they are behind on times with other venues.

However this Lady in marketing is stood in between myself/my bosses and the owners. 

1. She won't use twitter, because she want the business to remain corporate. 
2. Deletes posts by fans on Facebook for spelling errors.
3. The tools we do use for promoting, she is doing it wrong.  (The Facebook page has notes...everywhere!)

Any input or ideas we have she gets defensive, bearing in mind she is too old to grasp the concept of new avenues.  I have a client already in which I have been successful with campaigns in my city so i'm not in-experienced with this.  I have never met anyone like this and cannot talk direct with the owners because they favor her over anything we say/do.  To be honest i'd give up and let them fall behind, but I need the work.

How do I approach this?

Right now the only online presence is a facebook page, and a website, which cannot be edited because the guy who created it hasn't returned a call or email in the last 2 years (legal action is being considered). I've been managing the facebook page for a few weeks now, and the reach has increased noticeably since doing so. 

What I'd like to do is branch out a little further, and increase the use of photos to ""tell the story"" of our great little shop. I'm debating the merits between instagram and pinterest. I'm more familiar with pinterest, and like the idea that we can post photos of events, menu items, and customers, etc; while also being able to pin relevant articles, recipes, and so on. Then again, instagram allows for check-ins and hashtags, which could be useful too.

Econsultancy published a pretty exhaustive dissection of the FB post [here](http://econsultancy.com/ca/blog/63195-five-takeaways-from-facebook-s-news-feed-algorithm-update), including 5 key takeaways (challenge: read the FB post first and see if you can glean even 3 important takeaways, it's pretty bare bones).

My question(s): does the FB update actually clarify anything you didn't know already (aside from the story bumping thing, which is new)?

Is there anything else interesting in the update worth discussing, or anything the Econsultancy post missed?",,False,,t5_2qi2m,False,,,True,t3_1jw7c7,http://www.reddit.com/r/socialmedia/comments/1jw7c7/facebooks_news_feed_algorithm_fyi_post/,

Going through the 30+ pages I manage, I don't see any evidence of that - and I never did. My rich media posts are getting an average of 8.1K reached users, while text and links only get around 1.1 to 2.4K. So why am I still not seeing any blogs refuting Facebook's data?

A cursory Google search comes up with a few pieces from late June and early July suggesting that CMs switch to text-only posts, and no one seems to be offering any hard numbers on this.

I've never done this line of work professionally but I am knowledgeable in the arena having done similar work in the past for myself and my own websites. 

I do have a full-time job (field unrelated) so this would be done in my spare time. I have no intention to ""take them to the cleaners"", as I do enjoy this line of work, but I do feel I should be paid what the position is worth. When I asked how the position would be paid I was essentially told, ""Not sure, what would you charge?""

So, r/socialmedia, what is a fair amount to ask for a part-time social media manager? I'm open to any suggestions and would appreciate the feedback from people already working in this area or having been in this position before.

Not really a complaint, I like my job but sometimes feel like it's a job for more than one person. I'm not sure if I just need to suck it up.

I manage about 8 Facebook pages, from 100 fans - 6,000 fans.
I post about 3x/day for all businesses (which range from a baby clothes to a sports bar)

- I do the copywriting, research, and content research, and a lot of design for all. 
- I update the Twitter account for only 1 business (my boss insists 12 tweets a day)
- On top of email blasts, writing ad copy, meetings, and whatever else comes up.

The thing is, I'm always so busy. The digging for content is killing me. My boss is always on my about getting posts done so I have more time to plan marketing strategies, but he doesn't really understand that I can't just throw up shit on the Facebook pages AND expect the pages to do well. Personally, I'd rather not post than post something I know won't get any engagement, but I have to meet the 3x/day quota. (EX: tweeting 2 awesome tweets that get retweeted 30+ times opposed to tweeting 15x and getting only about 6 retweets total)

In short an issue had occurred between my company and a client. The client left a message on our Facebook about the issue, giving us a bad review. Before I could reply to the issue via Facebook the client called us and I was lucky enough to be given the chance to speak with him directly over the phone.

The issue was resolved with a full repayment before I even spoke with him but he still felt very wronged. I spoke with the guy for over an hour and by the end it honestly felt that we had gained some trust back. He did not seem upset at all after speaking with him. So I decided to just delete the bad message on Facebook and move forward.

Fast forward 1 month after the phone call. The same guy left a bad review on our Google+ account about the issue and about how the message was deleted. 

Did I mess up big time? I called him today but he did not answer so I left a message asking to speak with him again because I was under the impression that everything was settled. We gave him a reimbursement and just from speaking with him on the phone earlier; it felt like everything was okay - but apparently not.

What do I do now?

**TLDR** Guy had an issue with our company. Left negative message on our Facebook. He was given a full reimbursement and I spoke with him on the phone. Everything seemed fine.

A fresh look at a stale technique.,8,0,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/socialmedia/comments/1jwvat/priestlys_paradox_and_social_media_strategy_a/,"The story goes that in 1957 when talking about the relatively new invention known as television English novelist, playwright and broadcaster John Boynton Priestly remarked:


*“Already we Viewers, when not viewing, begun to whisper to one another that the more we elaborate our means of communication, the less we communicate.”*


Or when interpreted by modern academic types:


*“That as the quantity of communication methods increases the quality of the communication decreases.”*


This is Priestly’s paradox.


While this comment may be seen variously as cynical, technophobic, outdated or plain incorrect  (get with the times Priestly and stop being so negative, you’re wrong!); I argue that in many cases in the digital social space we inhabit Priestly was right on the money. 


Don’t believe me? Imagine explaining the concept of social media to someone in 1957 (or even 2007 for that matter):

 
Express yourself – *in 140 characters or less*


Show appreciation toward a statement – *by clicking like*


Laugh out loud – *don’t actually laugh, just type LOL*


Maintain friendships – *with people you’ve never met*

 

Is it fair to say that the quality of communication has decreased?


Yes – but this is a ‘glass half empty’ example, it lacks context and doesn’t begin to touch on the positives. Social media is a powerful tool for businesses and can be highly beneficial from a customer engagement, B2B networking, public relations and marketing perspective – depending on how it is used.


It is the *how* I wish to focus on.


Do you have one of *‘those people’* on your company’s Twitter or Facebook who share any and all links in any way related to their field on any given day?


“9 Ways to generate new leads”, “Must use app tracks social trends”, “33.3 ways to instant success”.


In a misguided attempt to be viewed as an informed credible source or thought leader in their industry these accounts can be seen as annoying, self absorbed and crying out for attention.With this technique there is usually little engagement (except for large companies), perhaps the odd like or retweet but rarely does this method incite meaningful communication. What’s worse is they are probably one of 50 people in the same loosely related field that will be sharing the same thing on the same day. It’s impersonal, demonstrates a lack of ideas and in this instance proves Priestly correct.


I like to think social tools can be used to increase the quality of communication so when devising a social media strategy for your business think – How can I prove Priestly wrong?


Here are some ideas:

 

**A ‘no link without context’ policy**: When sharing a link relate it back to your company, your customers or your industry and explain why it is important/relevant/applicable/good/bad etc. This is easier said than done at 140 characters but that just emphasises the need to think carefully around posting something.


**Creation of our own original content and commentary**: Quite simple really, where possible try to produce your content in-house.


**Quality over quantity**: You’re probably not entirely interested in what your customers had for lunch or the funny video someone found on their break so why bore them with these details. This relates heavily to the previous two points.


**Use manners**: Thank people for retweets, welcome new followers and friends and remain amicable despite the medium you are using. You may not be communicating in person but you can still be personable.

 

There will always be some degree of  removedness in social media interactions but following these simple guides (and remember they are only guides) can help you craft more relevant, engaging, personal and effective business communication in the social space.


*Do you have any hints that could prove Priestly wrong in the social media business realm?  Do you think the quality of communication is decreasing? Are you a constant link sharer? Let us know in the comments*

However, like every relatively new profession, I think you’re struggling with an identity crisis.

So I just had to wonder:  Does everyone whose business has to do with social media consultation or management have to call themselves a social media…

Wizard
Master
Maven
Expert
Genius
Savant
Or a…

Maniac
Can’t you just be “professionals” or something like that?

I love my all my “social media” followers (and they love me back because I usually follow them, too).  But, come on guys and gals, you need some sort of standardized title to call yourselves.  I really doubt that if I need your help, you’re going to pull a wand out of your pocket like a recent Hogwarts grad, aim it at my Wi-Fi connection, and POOF!  I have more followers.

“Wow, gee.  Thank you, Mr. Social Media Wizard!”

Side note:  I really like the ones I’ve followed lately who are “addicted to social media.”  Should we call for an intervention?  If I follow you back, am I contributing to your habit?  Gosh, if I don’t follow you back, how will you be able to pay your Pinterest pimp?  I feel dirty.

Seriously, though, I understand it’s a game we’re all playing.  Whoever gets the most followers when we die will win.

Right now, I’m just a small fry.  But one day, when I get to be a big potato, I can see myself hiring a social media person.  And I guess I would rather hire a maniac or a savant to handle my social media than a “professional.”  After all, we want results, right?  Here is where I suspect the difference lies:

Social Media Professional:    “Our organization has over 50 years of social media experience.  Bah.”

Me:  “Hasn’t social media only been around for about 10 years?”

Social Media Professional:  “You can trust that one of our low-level account executives will give you all the attention you deserve (which is only slightly better than you could’ve done yourself).  For only $75 an hour, bah, we think that’s a fantastic value on the market today.”

That sound was from me squirming in the high-back leather chair.

Now, let’s go to the social media maniac’s office in a downtown warehouse loft where we find me sitting on a vinyl yoga ball.

Maniac:  “We’re gonna do this and this and this and this and this.  And when we’re done with that, we’re going to drink some more espressos and do this and this and this and this.”

Me:  “How much?”

Maniac:  “Whatever you can pay, man!  We even take, like, Starbucks gift cards.”

For some strange reason nobody at the company had ever really looked at Facebook Insights, let alone exported the data. I have had some experience working with Facebook but I am trying to dive in deeper into the export XML that Facebook Insights spits out. By slowly combing through the multitude of metrics I have found a couple of ways to gain a better insight. 

I am wondering if anyone has done the same and has come across any interesting articles, tips, or ideas about Facebook Insights. I am always looking for a better way to analyze data or a new perspective. I appreciate any ideas or tips that you guys/gals may have.

Edit: Let me pitch in my two cents of what I do and why. Maybe you do the same, maybe not, maybe I am all wrong. If I am all wrong then I have been lying to people for a while.

1. Over time I have seen people make a similar chart to mine. I am not sure if I ""borrowed"" this from someone or came up with it myself. Either way this is something that I have used for a while. So what I do is:
   a. Eliminate all columns on page level export except Lifetime Total Likes, Daily Friends of Fans, and Daily Page   Consumption.
   b. Add the Lifetime Total Likes and Daily Friends of Fans together into a third column. 
   c. Chart that column with the date. This shows approximately how many people you can reach on any given day and the growth of your page. I can already hear the screams ""This is just Reach"" or ""Look at the ""Virality"". I know, it is similar but not the same. Without looking at 3rd, 4th, 5th degree connections that may see your post somehow I look at my fans and their immediate circle of influence, not somebody who is three degrees out and two continents away.

2. This is a quick way to glance at what posts are working and which ones are not. Nothing in depth, just a guide of where to look for issues.
  a. Take the Daily Page consumption and chart it with the date. This gives you a general idea on which days the posts did well or not so well. From there you can analyze the posts and days that did poorly. This doesn't mean the posts with low consumption were bad, there can be a number of factors that influence the consumption.

I just started last week a job as a social media manager for an extreme sports (surf, skate, etc...) channel in Europe. Before I started I was quite excited since Ive been surfing for the past 10 years of and have loads of good content and ideas on how to grow their online presence. 
However, after the first week I am quite disappointed.
 My manager keeps pushing content from our partners (which a lot of times have nothing to do with extreme sports) and everyday I receive at least 8 topics I need to post about of which the majority are promos for that only air in two weeks time (He often forces me to repeat the promos). This obviously is very inefficient and in a page with more 80 000 we usually get 10 to 50 likes per post (often less if we are repeating promos). In the end of next week I've scheduled a presentation with him, how can I convince him that people don't want to get their news feed flooded with promos for shows in two weeks time?
Also, if there is any software, case studies, articles, etc that you think might be useful for my job I would greatly appreciate it!

He works with banks to start and refinance mostly mom and pop businesses and also a small number of startups.  I've been in the small business and startup world since before I can walk, it's something I know and totally love.

I'm in college, and do some social media work on the side for friends and this summer during my internship.  I like it a lot, and it fits in great with my degree, so I feel like getting some practical experience might fit into a job (or a lot more freelancing) later.  I've never really gotten paid for it, but with the amount of work they're asking me to do, it's time to start looking at $.  

Now, when his clients ask questions at social media and marketing, he shoots them to me.  These are folks that don't have a facebook page, a twitter account, still use @aol email addresses.  I swear one guy still had a hotmail account.

I know I'm no expert.  Most of this will be setting up pages and accounts for businesses, then either running them or teaching the businesses fundamentals.  It's also a great way to get some good solid recommendations for future business.

My questions are these.
1) How do you sell the real, practical value of your services up front to these kinds of clients?

I’m not exactly sure of the protocol here, so I will be short:
I’ve been managing social media for over 3 years with more than 50 different clients, so my knowledge is substantial in that area. I’ve done some research on Reddit, and my brother constantly talks about how amazing it is. Truth be told, I just haven’t had the time to learn or use it. I’ve decided to just jump in head first and start learning by using. 

I’m interested in learning more about internet marketing, and I would love to start having some conversations about what I love: social media; and what I want to learn: Internet Marketing.

I would love some suggestions, and appreciate it.


Thanks.

I've been here for a few weeks and have been monitoring the FB page to take its temperature, so to speak.

What I've found is that there are a handful (4-10) of members who repeatedly bring up the same issues over and over, very much setting a negative tone. There are a few residents willing to clash with these ""bullies"" about the misinformation they're spreading - but not enough.

I've just gotten direction from the board that they want me to draft guidelines for posting to the FB page - so we have something to point to when we delete abusive, repetitive or already-addressed issues on the FB page.

I'm aware that deleting posts from a FB page or banning users is usually considered a bad road, but we have THREE other private web sites where member issues are discussed and handled.

If anyone can point me to some good sources for handling a social media issue like this, specifically with regards to HOAs, I'd be very grateful.

We need to schedule venues, speakers and refreshments for each event.  This means that we need to communicate with each other a lot over the course of a month.  So far we have used email as the primary source of communication, but with reply all's flying around it gets kind of difficult to not only keep them organized, but also stay on top of what is current.

We are looking for alternative platforms to use for communication.  I've considered Facebook groups and a Google+ community with hangouts.  Does anyone have any other suggestions or experience with what they use that they could share.  One important thing we need is mobile access.

Each time it's out of the blue and people I've never heard of.  

So I look them up and they have 180 followers and a Klout score of 35-50.  There's maybe 4 mentions of them on Google and no where is there mention of what they have done. Their linked in has some scattered marketing jobs and maybe 1 year managing social media for an unremarkable company.

Has anyone else noticed this? What would you say makes a specialist? Does Klout weigh in?  Shouldn't they have a list of clients and projects to demonstrate?!

One if these companies offers training. I went to a workshop they had and was just shocked at how basic their skills were. 

To me, you can't be called a strategist until you are emersed in social media and can demonstrate measurable success through campaigns you have completely strategized, executed and managed.  You dont need certification. 

I myself am fully engaged and have been since say one. I don't believe any training can make you a specialist. You have to just be doing it and for a while. I've been in it pretty much from day one and even I could never call myself a specialist and get uncomfortable if someone calls me that.

So, I'm a recent graduate (April 2013) and am currently in my first full-time job. I was hired on full-time where I've been interning since February of this year. By full-time, I mean 40 hrs/wk independent contracting...

When I started, I was blogging and doing research. I still blog, and am up to 8 blogs a week (1 post per blog, per week, so 8 posts a week total). When I started full-time, I also finally began to start doing community management. 

My company was hired by one client, a property management group. They tasked us to do social media (FB, Twitter, and Google+) for 14 properties. I am now doing 14 FB Pages, 14 Twitter accounts, and 10 out of 14 G+ pages (and will be doing all 14). In other words, I'll soon be doing 42 social media pages, along with 8 blogs.
