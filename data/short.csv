Short men tend to enjoy bragging about being with taller women, or just post images of short men with taller women. However, they find it irksome that women enjoy/prefer being with taller men. They find it utterly unfair and outrageous. This seems a bit hypocritical. 

Short men want to accept their shortness and be confident, and the only thing they seem to consider as proof of their success in this endeavor, is being with a taller female. 

As a short female, I can tell you all that this is outrageous, because now you're placing us as ""inferior"" to taller women. Short men cannot be with another short or shorter female because that's not as impressive and that would be considered succumbing to societal norms. It's like saying that tall women are like ferraris and short women are like run-down clown cars. Seriously guys?

Tall women don't like it when short girls get men, tall men state that they only ""settle"" for short women due to the lack of tall women, and short men think that dating a short woman is not nearly as impressive as dating a taller women. 

If you're going to complain about the unfairness and lack of interest you receive from females about your height, then don't make females of a similar stature feel like a last resort only for the desperate.

I've been hanging around r/short for awhile and I completely empathize with where the other males are coming from. I get it, 9 times out of 10, the first thing a new acquaintance notices about me is that I'm short. So what? Being short doesn't define me and it shouldn't define you. Be whoever you are meant to be - be the funny guy, the smart guy, the athletic guy, the social butterfly, the whatever guy you naturally are. Be the best version of that guy and strive to always get better. Be confident in that guy you stare at each day in the mirror. Do we have to work harder as short guys? Hell yes, but it's okay. Work your butt off at the gym, work to maintain great social relationships, work to be a badass in your career, and work like a madman in those areas where you want to improve. When anyone meets you, they will still initially notice you're short, but being comfortable in your own skin comes through with oodles of confidence. And this is how they will remember you when you leave. Everyone loves a man thats comfortable in his own skin and who is brimming with confidence (not cockiness). Will there still be girls that shoot you down because you're short? Yes. But there will be more girls out there that love being around you because of your infectious energy and positive vibe.

Life isn't fair and we can't all he 6'2"". Who gives a shit? The kid born in the projects laments at what he could have been if his parents had average wealth. The guy with a limp wonders what he could do with average legs. The man with cancer at 25 wonders what he could do with average health. And whether you see it or not, everyone is fighting to overcome something. Is it unfortunate that we aren't a foot taller? Sure. But it would be tragic of your height were to limit who you can become. You get one life. Work your ass off at who you are. Work to make yourself a better man every day. Light the fire from within and I guarantee you will have to fight them off with a stick.

I know there is always some else who has it worse, and when people post, I'm try to commiserate and acknowledge of their specific situation and not be competitive about it.

In this subreddit we all know men who are short can have it rough, but I wish posting female perspectives on being short wouldn't turn so often to ""yeah, but you don't have to deal with what guys do."" 

This is especially true when I see posts--to be honest, from guys and girls--along the lines of ""I have accepted that I am short and I'm working on being positive about my height""  and the thread derails into ""YOU DON'T HAVE IT AS ROUGH AS I DO!""

We are all short. We're all dealing with stuff because of it. Please try to focus on being supportive about discussions of pros, cons, high and very lows of being smaller than average for either gender.

Thank you for your time.

People are quick to judge short guys. Many guys will make fun of them and some women too.

If a short guy gets upset and reacts, he has a Napoleon Complex or Short Man Syndrome. That is a topic for another post.

Short guys are told and shown in person, [online](http://www.twitter.com/expsnghghtsm), in movies, on TV and through [advertising](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GpXGMnOkhs) that they are not as good as tall people.

Children are taught at a young age to view short people [negatively](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Farquaad) (I still love Shrek).

We are taught from a young age that the man is taller than the woman. That is what is ""normal"". If two people are in a relationship the man should be the taller of the two. From a little but preferably a head taller. That makes them look cute.

The man being shorter than the girl clearly really weird therefore we try to avoid it.

This is all socially acceptable.

Being shown this, average and tall people (sometimes without even noticing) feel that shorter guys are inferior. They think that when a short guy works out or gets good at a skill that he is ""making up"" for being short. Sometimes they think that they have the right to make fun of those who are shorter than them because they are better than them.

----
Being short makes life harder for guys. They are rejected on the spot for being short, therefore lowering there self-esteem.

Being short -/-&gt; Low self-esteem

Being short --&gt; Negative treatment --&gt; Low self-esteem

Short guys don't have low self-esteem because they are short. They are mistreated leading to the low self-esteem. This becomes a vicious cycle with people continually treating and rejecting short guys because they are short therefore continuing to lower their self-esteem.


**TL;DR** People treat and view short guys badly. That is why they have low self-esteem. They don't have low self-esteem just because they are short.

**PS**: Everyone knows a short guy who is the awesomest guy ever and has never had an issue with his height. He also gets all of the girls.

I love reading this subreddit and love seeing all the pictures and hearing the stories but one thing has been bugging me that I'd like to share/discuss/whatever.

Some of the most upvoted posts ever on this sub are of short guys showing off very attractive women they are seeing or dating (by the way I'm not slamming any of the OP's of those pictures! I love em!). The comments on these posts are always something to the effect of ""way to go, she's beautiful"" or ""you're winning at life"" or something like that. Conversely, when a girl posts of photo showing off a really tall or attractive guy it gets minimal upvotes (some are even downvoted to oblivion for some tiny shade of ""heightism"") and the comments are usually a mix of polite platitudes and then guys grumbling about how he's tall so he gets all the ladies.

The thing that's obnoxious to me is the issue of ""heightism"". A lot of guys on here complain about systematically discrimination due to short stature but then you guys go and do the exact same thing! You put more value on beautiful and attractive women then you do on plainer ones! Plain or ugly women get discriminated against and passed up for every type of opportunity in life. It may not be as easy to measure as height but I can tell you that they get skipped all over the place for jobs, promotions, and obviously romantic stuff too.

One recent post I can remember was posted by a girl who felt guilty that she was dating a really tall guy and she wanted to reassure everyone that she did not discriminate against short guys. The top comment was saying something like ""I just hate it when girls post their boyfriends height like it's the top score in a video game"". Again, you guys do it too! A guy posts a picture of him with a hot girl and he's ""winning at life""! It's all physical stuff. 

Like the girl in the post I was talking about above, I used to sorta feel guilty about heightism...but now I don't. In my opinion tall guys are much more attractive. If I post a picture with my tall, handsome boyfriend will I be ""winning at life"" too? How is that any different than loving certain facial features in a woman, or a hip to weight ratio, or a boob size or whatever.

I guess I thought the heightism thing was about something more. I thought it was about not making value judgments about people based on physical characteristics. But it just seems more and more like a bunch of guys who are upset because society doesn't see them as attractive; guys who don't want to upset the status quo but rather just redefine it so they don't have the ""short"" end of the stick. 

Sorry, this post is long

1366194950.0,68,self.short,1ciwsv,"I'm a male college student and 5'1 - and I am reminded about it all-day, everyday",80,12,81,http://www.reddit.com/r/short/comments/1ciwsv/im_a_male_college_student_and_51_and_i_am/,"Hi everyone. I'm glad I found this subreddit, I've been a lurker for awhile and it definitely helps to read other people's experiences with being short. I thought I'd share my experiences on here - there are probably not many (if any) shorter guys here, but people close to my height can hopefully relate. 

So I go to a University where I am majoring in business. I'm a 21-year old white male and nearly 5'1 barefoot, my exact height is probably 5'0 3/4,. I have a very proportional adult frame, I know I'm pretty good-looking (face-wise), and I'm very in-shape/muscular (I go to the gym often). I like to think of myself as a nice guy and pretty outgoing. I haven't grown in around 6 years and the doctor confirmed my height with x-rays, saying that he doesn't see any medical reason for my height and I'm perfectly healthy.

Another crazy thing is my mom and dad are 5'3 and 5'8, and I have a 14 yr old brother who is 5'7 and a 23 yr old sister who is 5'4. They're not that tall, but it still kinda sucks being the shortest out of them.  

Anyway, I CONSTANTLY get remarks about my height. And when I say constantly, I mean like I can't even go through a full conversation with a group of my friends/others without them saying something or staring down at me, noticing the size difference. People, even those I don't know, call me everything from cute, little man, midget, etc. And I clearly notice stares while walking around campus. Just the look I get from people when I order food, buy something, or ask a question is so noticeably different than the reactions that my friends get. 

Example: Today I went to McDonalds and the ladies inside were openly laughing and commenting on how short and cute I am for like 3 minutes. I went to the bathroom in my dorm and while washing my hands, some guy (around average height) I've never met before looks at me and smirks a bit. I said ""what"", and he goes ""idk I was just noticing the height difference...I don't mean this in a bad way but you're really short. You seem like a cool dude though."" These kinds of things happen to me every single day, whenever I converse with a new person they always feel the need to acknowledge my size. I think that because I am good-looking and (this is kind of a weird way to put this but) I've been told I look like a 5'10 guy that proportionally shrunk down to 5'1 - that people don't feel as bad when they comment because I'm not an ugly loser or something. 

Also, my friends joke all the time about it given any chance - when I'm standing up and talking with them the height difference it so noticeable that its hard to ignore - so I feel like my height is always on my mind. The main 7 guys I hang out with are all around 6'0-6'3, one guy is 5'9, and then there's me. I love these guys, but often if everyone is standing around talking and I say something, they all have to awkwardly look down to look me in the eyes and listen to me - of course, its very easy to see what they're thinking. I also always party on the weekends and have to endure a slew of short-related remarks every night from random drunk people. I do have some success with the females, but its very hard for me to find shorter girls that also want a guy my size. 
 
Anyway, that's my life in a nutshell. I feel like my social interactions completely revolve around my height, and it sucks that I'm not just normal - with the ability to just hang out and talk/be respected w/o people (and me) constantly noticing my size. I'm somewhat used to it by now though. 

So...anyone around my height have any advice/comments on all of this? How do you think my height will affect my future in business? Does it get better after college? Lots of girls are 5'1, do you think a 5'1 male is as noticeable in public/social settings as I'm making it out to be?

1362852005.0,69,self.short,19z9js,Why r/short isn't like r/tall,96,27,94,http://www.reddit.com/r/short/comments/19z9js/why_rshort_isnt_like_rtall/,"People always complain about the negativity in /r/short. They wonder why people aren't posting pictures of themselves in situations that humorously emphasizes their stature, like they do all the time on /r/tall. I'll try to explain why:

When a *tall* guy posts a picture of himself being too tall for a mirror, he is pointing out one small, negative aspect of an otherwise largely positive trait. If a *short* guy was to post a picture of himself being too short to reach a shelf, he would just be pointing out one among hundreds of negative ways his stature affects his life. That's the difference. The tall guy is subtly pointing out his superiority; the short guy is non-subtly pointing out his inferiority.

Being tall has both its positive and negative sides: Physically, you'll have disadvantages in some areas (eg. gymnastics and hide and seek playing), but at the same time you'll have advantages in many others (soccer, basketball, swimming, volleyball etc.). Socially, you'll be more respected, more attractive etc. Of course, some people might feel they ""stick out too much"" etc., which yes, if it bothers you, I guess you can call an issue, per definition, but in reality that's almost like complaining about being too good looking or about having too much money. It's easy to argue that the positive sides of being tall heavily outweigh the negative ones, especially for guys.

It's a bit different for girls: They benefit from being both physically feminine (short) and physically authoritative (tall). There is a sort of ideal balance between the two, I guess. Tall girls may feel or be less feminine, which may negatively impacts certain social areas, like dating, but at the same time it can be an advantage in other areas, like sports and business. *Shortness* for girls can be a physical disadvantage in sports and business, but it doesn't drastically compromise your social status / attractiveness (sometimes it can even be beneficial). In short: For girls, there are negatives and positives on both sides of the scale. What's ideal depends on which side you value the most.

Shortness for guys, however, has almost exclusively negative sides: In addition to being physically weaker, having disadvantages in many sports, not being able to see shit at concerts and all that shit that accounts for everyone, it comes with a social disadvantage. We're less respected by both genders, less attractive, less heard. . . and the list goes on.

Positive sides..? Come again..? Whenever someone lists up positive sides of being short, they are almost always half joking. Like when I was annoyed by my stature as a kid, my parents or uncles or whatever would respond with something like: ""But think about when you're playing soccer. You can just run with the ball through between everyone's legs and just score."" Yeah, maybe it would have been an advantage if it was true, but of course it wasn't; I was 10-20 cm shorter than my peers, not 1/6 their size. What's the point of even saying that? ""Hey, don't feel bad, because here's an obvious lie.""

4. When people say ""Wow, you're really short."" Because it wasn't obvious at all. But you still appreciate the comment.

5. Friends using your head as an armrest.

6. Hemming is required on all pants except for capris.

7. Your friend's shirt is now your new favorite dress.

8. The curve of a chair is always higher up than your back curve. I have deemed all adult chairs uncomfortable.

Just here to shoot out a quick thanks. 

I've had a bit of a lurk around here for a while, and I realise something now. 


I have been an arsehole, and a heightist. I used to laugh at short people for no reason other than that they were short. 

I'm not sure if this is because of society, or a personal thing, because I get a power kick from looking down on people- and from just being big in general. I know that is a really immature thing, but I still feel it. That I didn't choose. 

You opened my eyes, the same way hearing from gay people who were discriminated against convinced me to change my views on same sex marriage. I didn't think that height discrimination was a real thing, and then I didn't mind because I was privileged by it.

I argued that terribly.

But I realized: *it makes you stand out*. I'm starting to feel that you can mold people's perceptions into something that makes you even more formidable than normal. Look at this photo of Skrillex:

http://wac.450f.edgecastcdn.net/80450F/popcrush.com/files/2013/01/skrillex-larry-busacca.jpg

He just fucking radiates this kind of energy that I don't think he would if he was average height. It probably helps that the guys are leaning in to him, and he dresses totally differently.

Look at Ernie Reyes Jr. in this fight:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr88uA-attM

The fact that he's short seems to give this gravity around him. It just gives him this massive aura. Again, it probably helps that he's ripped as fuck and fights like crazy.

I think the problem for some short guys is that they try to look average. They dress like the average person and act like the average person. So they just look like a smaller version of an average person.

Instead, like both of the guys I posted, I feel you should capitalize on the fact that you're not average. Dress different, and act differently. Reframe your height into something of power.

In face of social stigma, isn't this what black people did?

I never really realized how much of a difference my height made until I read some of the things in this subreddit.  You see, since my growth spurt was right around the time I was going off to college I basically assumed that women were treating me differently and I was getting more respect from men because I was getting older.  While that definitely had some impact I realize now how much height affected things too.

I just want to say that pretty much everything you guys say I agree with.  Women have no problem talking about how they are ""not into"" short guys around me (in fact they foolishly think it is something I would actually want to hear).  If I get upset or angry or assert myself people take it seriously, I remember reading one guy say if he gets mad people act like he is a ""barking chihuahua"" which I can completely relate to from growing up on the short side of things.

I don't really know exactly why I made this post.  I just mainly read a lot of stuff here and it brought back a lot of memories from my childhood and teenage years and I wanted to say that the complaints you guys have are definitely grounded in reality.

1371000253.0,48,self.short,1g5yna,"25 years old, thrown back onto the dating seen... woah, not too shabby...",60,12,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/short/comments/1g5yna/25_years_old_thrown_back_onto_the_dating_seen/,"My first serious relationship just ended few weeks ago (yes, first. Bad luck, I'm short, but I'm picky too, blah blah... not really important). I just went on a first date a few days ago, and have two more (with two different females) in the works. As a fellow lower-lower atmosphere inhabitant I wanted to share some tips I've discovered recently and throughout the years.  

Now, I realize that as a 5'7"" male I'm one of the more fortunate people here, but keep in mind I'm also below the average eye-line of the dating crowd. I'm relatively picky when choosing a partner, but trust that I've had my share of frustration when it comes to my height, especially in high school and college. I've seen everything from the frequent, light, casual blows to my self-esteem to the outright, ""I don't want to date him because he's short."" Maybe it's because I'm in ""no fucks"" mode after parting ways with a girl I loved, or maybe it's because I've actually discovered a nice balance. Don't know, but read on if you want some non-self victimizing perspectives!   

1) Fuck heightism, but that won't change tomorrow.

-This post is focused on dating, not changing the world. You were dealt this hand and now you have to deal with it. You have to do better than many. Just like anyone else not born as a societal-ideal, you have to try a little harder, and overcome a lot more. You can let it beat you or you can embrace it and ball so hard muhfuckas wanna fine you. 

2) Not every girl wants a 6'4"" demigod. 

-Not every rejection you get is because of your height. If you don't want to be generalized as an angry hobbit or a Napoleon, don't generalize all women as shallow, that mentality is damaging to both genders. She's not necessarily looking for Bradly Cooper (and if so, fuck, I'd do that dude...) If you assume that's what's going on then you just become cynical. That then makes you less appealing and a vicious cycle begins. I know some of you have been put through a lot of bullshit, but you are also in the unique position of being the one who can be the bigger person (no pun intended) and break this cycle. You don't fit everyone's tastes, just like everyone doesn't fit yours. Nobody should be hated for that as long as they're civil about it.

3) Dress well, and more importantly, strategically.

-This bit isn't about becoming something you're not, changing your image, etc.. It's about maximizing your potential. Slim fitting clothing is key, bagginess only hurts your cause. I don't quite mean skinny jeans and Jersey Shore tees, but pants that are ""straight fit"" or shirts that are fitted, or ""athletic"" are great. Try to have your shirts end just below your belt if they're not tucked in. ALWAYS wear a belt. Roll up the sleeves on long sleeve shirts. Know your ideal pant length, even an extra inch can make you look like you're trying on your dad's clothes. Seriously, these things help.

4) Maybe a haircut is in order? 

-I'm a little weary with this one, because you shouldn't have to completely transform yourself to find someone, but hear me out. I started buzzing my hair ~6 years ago, and I kid you not, most of my high school friends thought I got taller. Now for me, it works. I have no hair prep to do in the morning, my head is shaped pretty normally, and I haven't paid for a haircut in 6 years. If you're attached to your mop, do you. Maybe the beard could use a trim? Neck hair? In general, move away from The Shire when it comes to hair care... 

5) HOBBIES, for the love of god hobbies.

-This is my biggest one. Between guitar, piano, music mixing, painting, drawing, reading, and building random inventions, all my days have the potential to be filled WITHOUT socializing or a female companion. No doubt should you be doing/looking for both those things, but the point is to enable yourself to not only function, but prosper when friends, females, or both, are slow. These are activities that you can look forward to, to take your mind off the occasional (or frequent) loneliness spell. Not only that, but notice I didn't write video games, TV, or movies. I love all of those too, but the initial hobbies I mentioned, along with hundreds more, are about self-improvement, passion, and an added side-effect is that they help your cause. You'll become more independent, give less fucks, and have more to talk about.  

A few more that are probably obvious/recycled:

6) Exercise, fo real. At least 3 times a week. For your health, and for your game. Oh and eat well. Duh.

7) Fuck the bar/club scene. Put no faith in that, it's shallowness on parade. When you go out (and DO go out) focus on your friends, joke around, drink, try to hook them up, have no expectations but DO have an open mind, and maybe one of those nights you get lucky, but don't expect it. 

8) Do stuff you want to do. Rock climbing for instance, go if you want, even if your friends don't want to. You'll find people there with similar interests.

9) Say yes to things, even if you're tired. 20 years from now you won't remember that night you caught up on the Walking Dead. 

10) Stay positive and keep the faith, Rome wasn't built in a day.   

Well, that's all for me. Maybe this post will never see the light of day. Maybe it's all cheesy recycled optimism. Maybe some cynical redditor will find a hole in everything I've said. Either way I'm glad I've shared what has worked for me. If I help just one of you out there get laid, then this assassin of sass has done his job.

http://i.imgur.com/8mCuW.jpg
- my most recent picture; a bit of my face is covered and my bow tie is crooked; but eh it happens. Short, and still ballin.

This is just me rambling for a little trying not to freak out about finals this week.

I for one, always knew i was going to be short; at birth my chest was caved in and my parents had thought it was for chest problems. Doctor Told them I'd be short and stocky.

*23 years later* here I am; 5 foot 1, and pretty balling. Should be graduating college this summer after a successful internship ^.^ I have no hope for growing any taller, but I've been able for the last 15 years ago to have accepted myself the way I am (although I really wish i didn't have this uni-brow).

 One of the things i love most of all, Are my really super tall friends. Without them I would never have been able to love myself for being short. It's like ying and yang; good and evil; we both need each other. Tall people have a hard time doing things, balancing, and getting into places; And when we cant reach stuff on the top shelf they're their to save us. Something my friends and I always joke about was the one time I was drinking a small can of arizona black and white tea, while my tall, skinny friend, who happened to be black, was drinking the regular taller 99 cent can of black and white. The lulz ensued.

But let me tell you; i don't think people discriminate on height as much as you often thought. In-fact, most of the short tiny men i've known have had way more girls then the taller men, (One guy I know iss 5"" 3' and does dancing for female bachelorette parties managed to score himself a pair of twins, and asians at that.) In-fact I myself have even had more relationship experience then most of my tall friends. 

What I wanna say is this, I don't think you should ever view yourself as not being tall; that makes it seem like you're lacking something, We're not. We're just blessed on the other-end of the spectrum. Some girls like taller men, some shorter men. Some guys love tall girls, some like short girls -&gt; Mario and peach anyone?

It's all about presentation; You can go one of three ways; You can make yourself being short hold you down, or you can accept it and draw attention away from it. Or you can promote the benefits of being short. 
For those of you who don't think there are many benefits of being short other then hiding under desks during catastrophes; I'll leave you guys with a short list.
Benefits:
1. Less intimating to kids and shy girls.
2. Won't take up as much room in a bed. Sleep EVERYWHERE XD
3. We look more fit with less muscle.
4. We will never hit our heads on a doorway.
5. We often look younger then we are. (I don't think i look like I'm 23)
6. We can get through crowds of people better.
7. If people are giving you a hard time you're closer to the weakest of weak points.
8. We don't need to spend extra-money to buy larger clothes.
9. We can still wear awesome light-up sneakers.
10. I can easier hide behind people to avoid interacting with people I don't like.
11. I can eat less and feel more stuffed ^.^
12. I don't know how many randoms hugs i get, because I'm short it's like I'm instantly 30% more adorable then the taller guys.

So I might be average looking and short, but I'd never want to change the fact that I'm short.
Thanks for reading my ramblings :)

I had her laughing constantly crackin some pretty witty jokes. Learned a lot about her. Went to a few other bars got pretty tipsy. Come time to head home, she said youre a great guy really hot, funny and i had an amazing time with you so glad you werent a creeper! and i think its so awesome you are going to be a nurse. Youre just way too short and i could never go out with someone whos barely taller than me. If you were taller id totally go out with (date) you . Has this happened to anyone else? and how did you respond? i was pretty speechless but took it with a grain of salt and just kind of laughed it off but on the ride home is when what she said really kicked in now im pretty bummed out.  And i say to hell with her for being shallow and having such a shitty reason to not give someone a chance especialllly if you did have a good time. i mean that might be a cop out but why the hell would she have invited me up? ahhhh this isnt the first time ive heard ""id totally date you IF"" or ""youd be so hot if you were taller"" i work hard in school, workout. not a fuck up. yet i still get this. really taking a toll on me. luckily im only 21 and still have a lot of maturing to do but even so im not getting any taller.

I am a 5'3 adult male and I have been short all my life. Being short sucks for sure, but I have learned to cope with it, and I haven't allowed my lack of height stop me from accomplishing my goals. 

When I was a teen I wanted to join the military and I amost didn't do it because I was worried about being the shortest guy there and not being able to make it. Luckly, I decided to force myself to do it and, although it wasn't easy, I made it through basic training, got promoted faster than anyone else in my class, and ended up really enjoying time in the service.

When I got out of the military I knew I would face another challenge finding a good job. ""Short+Shy"" didn't seem like the best combination for success in the corporate world. When a rep for my dream job offered me an interview I tried to talk the recruiter out of it. I didn't think there was a chance in hell I was going to get the job, but you know what, I forced myself to fly out there and interview and I ended up beating out at least 20 other people for the job (all of which were much taller than me btw). I now work for a different company and I have a pretty successful career with a six figure salary.

Dating has always been the big challege for me. At one time I thought I would never find anyone, but then I realized I wasn't really trying hard enough and I was too afraid of rejection. I forced myself to become more active in dating, clubs, etc and over the years I have met plenty of girls that didn't really care about height, or If they did I was able to change their mind about it, or I would accept the rejection and move on to someone else. I have had some awesome relationships because I didn't let my height become my crutch.

Now don't get me wrong, I still feel that being short in our society is tough. No doubt about it. Sometimes I feel like I have to work harder than others. I have tried to accept it over the years but even today if there was a magic pill to make me taller I would take it in a split second. I think the real difference now for me is I refuse to let something I can't control stop me from living my life. I try my best to accept who I am and not allow it to be a limitation and that is how I cope with being short.",,False,self,t5_2sgvi,1363385401.0,,,True,t3_1adfur,http://www.reddit.com/r/short/comments/1adfur/how_i_cope_with_being_a_short_guy/,

1373303994.0,47,self.short,1hvibo,impressions about dating a man shorter than me,51,4,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/short/comments/1hvibo/impressions_about_dating_a_man_shorter_than_me/,"Height is something I had never given much through about it, much less dating-wise, but I have recently started going out with a guy shorter than me for the first time and I have been thinking about it (and found this subreddit!) so I through you might be interest in my impressions...

For reference, I'm 5'7''. I'm from south america, where that makes me a relatively tall woman, but I have been living in europe for a while, where that's the average height for a woman. I'm late 20s and I have dated plenty of guys the same height as me (mostly back in my home country but also here in europe) or taller.

I have been using online dating ever since I moved here, and I never even through about looking at guy's heights. I have been on plenty of first-dates with short guys, but until now, they always seemed not to be interested in me (maybe because they expected me to be shorter? They usually had the same height as me listed in their profiles but in person were shorter).

Well, this guy, the first time we met I already had my drink and was sitting down at the table, so he grabbed a drink and we got on talking. So it was a while before we stood up together and I realised he was shorter than me (I feel is a bit offensive to say a ""halo effect"" happened there, I don't necessarily assume anything relating to people's height), about 3 inches I would say. I didn't think anything of it (but later had a look at our profiles and he listed himself a inch taller than me...). 

That was a month ago and since then we have been seeing each other once a week always for fantastic dates and amazing sex. My impressions have been:

- I'm quite large, not exactly overweight but I have large shoulders and hips, I don't have the most traditionally feminine body, so is quite often that if I'm with a skinnier guy than me, I feel like a huge blobby monster when having sex... That doesn't happen with this guy. Lying down, height is so hard to notice, that it becomes much more about his body proportions, which are just perfect.

- I have come to appreciate the fact that at the same time, he is quite ""light"", which means not feeling like I'm being crushed in certain positions and making for some other little moves much easier to execute.

- I have always felt 69 was a damn clumsy position, but it works out really well with him.

- He has only commented on his height once this whole time, in a sarcastic self deprecating way (""with this shirt I look like *celebrity* but many inches shorter... I'm not insecure about my height at all! Ha ha""). Honestly, it hasn't his most attractive moment, I don't tend to find this kind of comments endearing, but it was pretty harmless as far as it goes. And thankfully it wasn't in comparison to my own height.

- I actually really like having a good excuse not to wear heels, since I'm not an expert at using them (one of our dates was a fancy dress but I managed to come up with an outfit that went well with flats). But I do have a few heeled boots I love using from time to time, I'm just waiting for the right time to ask him if it would bother him if I wore then while with him.

- It really doesn't bother me at all our height difference, the only thing that has made me think more about it was when he made the self deprecating comment, maybe if it wasn't for that it wouldn't have crossed my mind as a possible issue (but yeah, I do appreciate the information that this is something that might be in his mind, hence why I decided to look a bit into on how to be sensitive about it)

- When we are holding hands across a table, I do feel a bit... weird sometimes that my hand is larger than his (as I said, I'm kinda bulky), when he kinda noticed that he then complimented MY hand. I through that was awfully nice and smart of him, because if I felt weird, it really had nothing to do with his hand being small, but mine being large.

I think that's kind of it, I hope it has been helpful to someone?

I already knew the whole ""too short"" means zero consideration whatsoever and no potential, but that twitter account was flat out dehumanizing and disgusting. It's like short men are just bottom feeders.

I fell in love with a girl a few years ago, absolutely beautiful, and she told me she wouldn't date me because I was too short. I specifically said ""I'm sure we'd still be just friends if I was taller."" and she said ""No, we wouldn't."" That stuck with me for a while. 

Also, so many times I read through female posters comments about how she ""wouldn't mind"" (ouch) a short guy, and she's still attracted to them, but her current partner happens to be 6'4 (but we shouldn't feel bad) ...but hey listen to her still though. I'm not saying she's lying or trying to be hurtful, but after the pattern becomes apparent, it starts to eat at you. It just makes me sigh and feel worse to see it over and over again.

After I read so much r/short I wanted to chime in/say hi/rock up for a chat. I've been lurking on reddit for about 2 or 3 months, on and off, so I guess this was the tipping point for creating an account for me! 

Anyway. I'm a 5'8"" girl and tall guys are rather a turn-off for me. 5'9"" is pretty much my limit. (I know that's not really that short compared with most of the people here, but it's not that much taller than me...)

Besides just not being my type, there are also logistics to consider.

I've only really dated one guy, who was probably about 5'9"". I really liked that about him. Not to mention that while it lasted it was brilliant to be able to hold each other and have a conversation at the same time. I liked that we were on the same level, made everything so much easier. If I were to date a taller guy sometime in the future, I have no clue what I'd be supposed to do if my head only came up to his chest. Neck cramp or having my head smooshed against his chest just doesn't sound like that much fun. :(

That said, it's not just guys around the same height as me. I find guys 5'7"" and below extremely attractive, and would hope that the logistics that bug me with taller guys wouldn't bug a short guy if a relationship were to possibly arise (though I feel a bit hypocritical saying so!).

I seem to have rambled on a bit there about how awesome y'all are. Not trying to fetishise anybody or anything, I just find shorter guys hot. No idea why.

After reading so much r/short and realising how much negativity you guys have to deal with, I thought I might let ya know.

Listen up guys (sorry to exclude girls but this advice really only relates to what short guys go through when hitting on women)!

I was short my whole life and skinny, damn skinny. Smallest, skinniest kid in the class, etc... But somehow, somehow!!!, I developed a huge personality and today, at 30 years old, I still wear it proudly, it is who I am.

We all know that we fight with one major drawback in our short-statured lives. Women. For whatever reason, call it being raised by a shallow society, call it subconscious, call it the media, movies, peer-pressure...whatever. A very large amount of women seem to hold true to one of my favorite lines by Modest Mouse:
&gt;You ask me what size it is. Not what I sell.

You know, I used to let it bother me, it used to seep into MY subconscious, to the point where I would even 'down' myself during conversations, saying things like 'I know I am a pretty small guy but..."" etc...

I used see women that were taller than me and think **""Ok, no point in even trying...she has probably *never* been with a guy my height and wouldn't even consider it.""**

Know what I tell myself now? 

**""Alive41stime, if this girl has never been with a short guy, then you are going to be the first!""** 

You are going to conquer this mountain, and shatter every bullshit belief this girl has ever been force-fed.

Because it IS bullshit. We all know that, and that is why it drives us crazy.

And after I prove to this girl how it REALLY is, by being the kind and smart and amazingly hard-working and talented person that I am. Every other short guy who comes after me is going to have that much of a better time dealing with her. Who knows, she may even tell all of her friends about that short guy who totally blew her mind and showed her that being a man has nothing to do with how far your head is from the ground.

So take this advice, my short-brethren, and run with it. You don't have to go looking for tall girls on purpose, but stop allowing yourself to disqualify them. Make them disqualify YOU. Its not like we aren't used to it. Turn that into a strength. Most girls, believe it or not, are just going to give you a hard time in the very beginning, frankly because they are insecure about themselves. Push through that first part, work four times as hard as the average-height guys, something else you are already used to doing.

If they make a comment about your height. Use humor. ""Wow, you are so tiny?"" ...""Oh' yeah.."" you will say with a smile ""Well we're all the same height lying down.""

Be yourself and don't allow them to brush you off, be persistent, and you would be surprised how many girl will begin to look past your height. Be the awesome short guy full of character and personality. Then you will actually look BIGGER as a person. You will separate yourself from all the other short guys who let that fact crush them.

DO IT!!!!! Every time you win, you win for all of us. 

And take it from me, it works!!! I was just with a 5'11 English girl, beautiful too...and sooooo smart. Every battle you win, converts one more girl! 

SMALL POWER!!!! We are more unique anyways. I now love being small, makes me stand out. And I manipulate that attention and form it into a strength. DO IT!!!!!!

If I see some guy my height I look back 4-5 times and MAKE SURE I had it right.  I am 26 years old, I’ve slept with 2 women. One of them being a 2 year superficial “seeing each other” type thing where I got used for rides, lunches and a boyfriend type feeling in exchange for occasional sex. And the other a very awkward one-night stand. I am not even sure if I should count it. My height is something I hate about myself. To the point where I had started to just give up on women. Knowing that they’d only date “normal” height guys. Not to mention, I am the nice guy. I am funny..I’ve been told. I usually end up being friendzoned THE FASTEST. I’ve reached the depths of friendzone you guys can’t imagine. The last 5-6 girls I mustered up the courage to ask out for dinner ended up with “aw..no thanks”. Reader, you know who you are. If you can relate to any of this, do read on. 


I just wanna tell you guys, something amazing has happened. I met the girl of my dreams a month ago. I met her over facebook, started talking to her and ended up meeting her. We have now been dating for 2 weeks and are CRAZY about each other. The best part is, I played NO GAMES, I was just being myself, making jokes and telling her how pretty I think she is, being 100% honest with her. Turns out, there are still girls out there who like honesty and will just like you…for you. As for how hot she is, she visited NYC a few weeks ago and ended up getting two cards on two separate occasions from Victoria Secret agents. And on top of that, miss xyz could be Dr. xyz someday. She is applying for med school and has a 3.9 gpa from a the topmost university of our city. And ..I am her first boyfriend. Ever. She hadn't even held hands with a guy. She is 22. 

Am I bragging? A little bit. But mostly, I wanna tell you guys I’ve realized height truly doesn’t matter at all. As much as I joked about it, I have always been self-conscious about it. I will say though, I did start working out more efficiently than I used to. Started to look a little fit. But I am still the shortest guy you will see walking around. I am experiencing a true example of how looks don’t matter all that much as a killer personality does.  That is all. 

TL;DR- I am an extremely short guy, dating a taller, MUCH MUCH MUCH MUCH hotter woman than me. All I had to do, was tell her exactly how I feel and just be myself. Truly be myself.

However, after taking the time to encouragingly respond to some dangerously negative posts (e.g., people hinting at suicide or surgery), mainly younger (teen to early 20s) guys, my own positive talk got to me. 

Overall, these past few months, I feel more grounded and don't take things personally. One of the defining moments was when a girl who had a crush on me flip shit about Jews without knowing I was one...on a date: yet another thing I can't control. Needless to say, I was very upset, but I realized it's just not my effing problem as unjustified as her racism was. Most people don't care and some people who matter to me actually like my ethnicity. I got up and left. I rejected *her*. Replace ""Jew"" with ""short,"" and I realize I would have responded correctly if she railed about how short guys are creepy. There's 100 things a woman can legitimately or illegitimately reject me for. It's her problem. She doesn't get to date *me*, because I don't date racists.

Sometimes you have to smirk and say to yourself ""you can't win 'em all."" No one can be responsible for others' preferences, biases, or prejudices. Of course you can try to call out people for vicious hatred or prejudice, but irrational people tend to act...irrationally. Getting mad or trying to defeat a stupid argument with logic is like pouring gasoline on the fire. You just can't take things personally as hard as it is. It's practice. I'm only just beginning to figure it out well into my 20s.

Also, I realize a huge amount of negative feelings I had over my height were in my head. Thoughts like, ""I probably got treated badly because of my height"" or ""she would probably date me if I was taller."" ~~I guarantee 90%~~ I think much if not most of the time you feel your height led to a negative outcome, it was something completely different. 

I empathize with short teen guys because I was a short teen guy. I realize shit can be very bad when your entire world is high school or college and you're surrounded by immature idiots looking to impress other idiots. However, again, I realize how much of my negative feelings were my own fault. There were girls who liked me when I was a teenager, but I didn't like them for equally superficial reasons. Instead, I convinced myself no one I liked, liked me because I was short. This internalization led to me to act in ways that actually impacted my status until recently: I walked hunched over, I didn't make eye contact, I dressed like a kid in clothes that didn't fit (partly because I thought I would look ridiculous in clothes I actually liked), I did things to please others, I constantly sought validation, I mumbled. Guys: seriously ask yourself if and why you do any of these things.

I'm not saying to look on the bright side of being short, but rather understand how your self-image impacts your actual image. Try to see the bigger picture.

I'm definitely a short guy and it's mentioned here and there but not in a super mean way ever. A woman has actually never told me I'm too short for her to date, although I'm sure they've thought it or maybe told their friends. The only time a dude's ever mentioned it is when I was in a bar and a girl much taller than me was hitting on me and he said he expected her to spring for a taller dude but it was again in a playful way. 

When I read this subreddit I start feeling like I'm super short and a freak and everyone notice it and no woman will ever want to date me! It makes me super paranoid. Or that I'm blind and that I don't notice I'm super 'weird'. 

I'd love to be taller yeah but when I say taller I mean more like five seven because I'm oddly attached to being short at this point. I like being the short charming dude and I guess it's a point of pride that even though I'm not be society's standards conventionally attractive or super manly I know how to get women (well I'm not swimming in them or anything but I definitely have dated around) and be seen as a sort of leader in many situations.

[This is me, a year ago.](http://imgur.com/a/7WI3X#0) The photos are the kind of head shots an actor has made, which is why the lighting and focus is so pretty.  But that's the real me, no Photoshopping.  


I've been working out five to six days a week for the last five months and have put on a significant amount of lean muscle.  Today, I'm basically a cut version of what I look like in those pictures.  I don't have any pictures of my current body that aren't NSFW, so you'll just have to trust me.


However, this week, like every week, I made the seeming mistake of talking to girls I don't know at a bar or parties.  And I was shot down again . . . and *again*.  


Some girls said it outright (""I'm not into small guys,"" ""Short guys aren't attractive, sorry""), some insinuated it (calling me ""boy"" or ""kid,"" even though, at 26, I'm often older than they are), but most do the ""cute"" thing.  


They think they're being kind, sparing my feelings, but they're not.  They're humiliating me.


Now, see, I'm a confident guy.  


I know, without hyperbole, that I am more intelligent, more talented in more ways (actor, writer, musician, composer, stand-up comic [all with varying degrees of actual success]), and generally a more decent man (my momma's words and my grandfather's church taught me to respect everyone, be loving, not be dishonest) than almost any guy a given girl in New York City is going to meet.  


I can also do the sexy-time with great flair and care, if given the chance (note: I do not actually call it ""doing the sexy-time"" when pursuing or engaging in said acts).


But the vast, overwhelming, soul-crushing majority of ladies in NYC only see a short guy when they see me . . . and they stop there.  The girl could be short, tall, slender, thick, white, black, Asian, or any other diverse combination . . . but she stops once she sees I'm half a foot or so shorter than my circle of friends.


But, hey . . . at least she said I was ""cute.""  Now she can get rid of me, conscience clear.


I'm not sure what I am attempting to accomplish by spilling all of this out.  


I'm the kind of guy that will sometimes inwardly roll his eyes at yet another sob story of perceived prejudice by the minority victim group of the week.  Because, hey, we've all heard so many stories of someone being screwed over because of something about themselves they can't control and shouldn't change that we become dead to it.  But only recently I've realized I've always been part of one of those groups.  


No, no one is trying to kill me or say I can't vote or marry.  I know I don't have it that bad in the grand scheme of things.  But I've recently admitted to myself that heightism is a real, legitimately concerning form of prejudice.  Mostly notably in the realm of sex and dating and relationships.


I don't want to be taller.  I want to be desired.


Thank you, denizens and citizens of r/short, for forming a community where I can just . . . unload.  And cry a little.  And then feel better in the morning.


I love you all.  May the peace of God be with you and yours.

This afternoon, as my pregnant wife and I were walking our 2 year old son, I told her ""honey, I've found my people and...they're a bunch of whiners.""


You see, I'm 5'1"". Since I hit puberty, I've also been somewhat overweight. Oh, I'm also visible minority and English has been my 2nd language since my family moved to North America when I was about to turn 18.


Ya, being short ain't easy. Where I come from I was considered somewhat short, but compared to North Americans I'm a dwarf. You, yes, you 5'8"" guy, get out because you're not short (ya, I understand, it's all relative).

Anyway, as many others have said, don't worry too much about your height. Focus on yourself, figure out what you want from life and work your butt off to achieve it. Forget the chicks who judge you based on a physical trait you have no control over. Along the way, you'll meet a mature gal who will love you for who you are.

My wife is 5'2"" and I think she is a hot little Latina (I'm middle Eastern and our son looks quite exotic, I'm so jealous of him). I also insist she wear high heels because I find it incredibly sexy to walk with a woman taller than me.

You know what pisses me most about tall guys? That they have such easy access to good clothing, yet they dress awfully. Come on man, you know how long it takes me to find a shirt that isn't to my knees while still fits me around the shoulders.

That's all for now, I guess I just wanted to say, some of us short men have managed to do just fine, so don't give up hope yet.

I just want to thank all of you for your suggestions and tips. The height disparity was a little bit weird in the beginning, but I'm so used to it by now. I actually really like it now since I feel like I'm dating a supermodel. Everything is going great, and I could not have asked for a better girl. Thank you again everybody!

My friend introduced me to one of her friends who was new to my school. I'm a senior and she's a junior. My friend had told me that she was one of her shorter friends but she is still 2-3 inches taller than me. She's nice and I like her.
**TL;DR and skip the first 3 lines if you don't want the boring description**

We've gone on one or possible two dates. The first time we went to the country club next to my school and hung out, talked, and I bought us some food to share. It was just us hanging out for about half an hour and then one of my friends showed up with his girlfriend and joined us. I don't know if that counts as a date. 

The second date was this weekend. She referred to it as a date so I was happy and called it that too. I don't know if this matters but I paid for the tickets before she showed up because my friends insisted that I had to. She insisted she pay for the popcorn but I paid. The movie went well, I was nervous during the movie as I am new to the dating game. My best friend who does pretty well with girls told me to casually put my arm around her. I did and she liked it and the rest of the date went well. At the end of the date she said she really enjoyed it and she agreed that we should do it again.

Today I got two texts from her telling me that I was too short for her and I should stay away from her. I sent her a ""?"" then she texted me apologizing and telling me that it was her friends.

So that worries me that her friends think I'm too short for her and that they're gonna influence what she thinks of me.

**EDIT: She said that her friends took her phone and sent it.**


**EDIT #2: So I talked to her today and found out exactly which friend it was: her ""special"" friend who has ADHD and acts crazy. I met that friend today and all she did was talk about how she's not going to vote for Mitt Romney. We're in Canada and she's 16. Though this may sound mean, I'm glad it wasn't one of her more rational-minded friends.**

After some years of trying to get over my insecurities I've finally managed to accept that I can't change my height, so I have focused on the good side of it.  I just wanted to share this with you guys, so here go the perks: 

*Space: In cars, planes or buses, there is never a seat that's too small for me, so I am always confortable!

*Clothes: My height didn't change much through my puberty, so I still have clothes from when I was 11 that fit me (I am 17 now).

* Muscle growth: Only a few weeks in the gym create a noticeable difference in my muscles. I've talked to some short friends about this and they have said the same happens to them.

*Spooning: My boyfriend told me he loves to spoon with me because I am the greatest small spoon, and he can cover my whole body with his!

I'm psyched that there is a subreddit just for short people, because short people are awesome, but there's a lot of depressing stories in here, for sure.

Based on my own experiences, women seem to care about a lot more than height. Most women I've been with have been at least 5'7"". I think the tallest was 6'1"" or 6'2"". The second tallest was 5'11"", and she didn't care about it until people kept harping on her about ""how funny you two look together"" incessantly for a good few months. She finally caved to the pressure and ended things. I don't deny that height is very important to some women, but if things were as bleak as a lot of dudes on here make it out to be I don't understand why I've never had any issues with my height in this way before.

Granted, I have met all of these women in person. I haven't tried online dating, so maybe when/if I do that I will be glossed over for taller men. Based upon what I've been reading here it seems like LOTS of shorter men have serious issues meeting women that are interested in them and they feel that it is because of their height, and this isn't usually restricted to online dating.

Am I the odd one out here in that I've never had any issues with this before as a man? Surely I can't be completely alone.

There are only a few things I dislike about being short:

* Finding a nice winter coat where the arms aren't too long is a pain sometimes.
* In very large crowds it's tough to see what's going on if there are too many tall people in front of me, but I'm small so I can squeeze my way to the front usually.
* Finding pants/jeans that aren't too long can be annoying. This can sometimes go for dress shirts, too, but it's mainly with jeans/coats as I've said.

Apart from that I'm happy at my height and I never really gave too much thought about it until I started hanging out around here in this subreddit. I've always just been used to most everyone else being taller than me and never saw it as a bad thing.

I'm interested in hearing from anyone, whether you're like me and haven't had any issues with your size, or you have and you want to enlighten me a bit on how it feels for you and what you've had to deal with. New perspectives and new questions that people ask me are only going to help me grow and learn, so all comments and questions are welcome.

 Her cousin is also her age, and also met a guy online. Her cousin is much taller than her though at 5'11 or something (one of those Giant-esses).

I felt my heart sink thinking, yeah how am I going to compare to that? he's probably like 6'4 or something, and perfect.

We talk about them for a bit, then she mentions on the offhand that. he is.. get this... 5'6, and that her cousin won't stop talking about him.

That's a link to a thread on /r/tall which I found really offensive. The post itself is a link to an insanely heightist article which shows that tall people earn $789 more per inch. It currently has 55 upvotes and is rising rapidly.  

Imagine if /r/OneY (men's subreddit) started posting and upvoting articles which showed how men earn more than women. Imagine if a pro-white subreddit started posting and upvoting articles which show how white people earn more than ethnic minorities. This would not be accepted as it would be seen as sexist or racist, but heightism? Well that's perfectly okay in modern day society. 

Why are we sister subreddits with these people? I'm not sure how other's feel, but I for one am not comfortable with it considering they celebrate how they have an unfair and unjust advantage over us and mock us (look at the thread, another redditor was pointing out how this was heightist and a user posted calling him a ""little butthurt manlet"" and he currently sits on 4 upvotes). 

I mean, look at their sidebar where they mention us for christ's sake. It states ""/r/short, where everyone is fun-size"". Fun-size? I find that extremely patronising. 

Perhaps I'm making a too big a fuss about this but I was really offended when I saw the post. Why do we associate ourselves with people who lambaste us and celebrate inequality?

So I guess I should explain that I'm 5'2"" wearing stilettos on a tall hair day, and *all my life* I've experienced comments about my height. 

Some comments are good natured (others not so much), but never has one cut so deeply as when it dropped unexpectedly from the mouth of my best friend.

I had a tight group of friends. There were five guys (give or take, depending on the day) and three girls that made up the core group. We were all close, so it was no surprise to anyone when me and my boyfriend at the time (now husband) started dating.

Me and him had been best friends for years and many of our friends had ""called it"". Thing is? He's 6'2"". We're ridiculously mismatched physically, but thats never bothered either of us.

From the moment I started dating him, my best girlfriend at the time became standoffish and angry. I knew that years ago she had liked him, but she was clear that it had passed. Once we started dating, I became paranoid that she still harbored feelings and that *that* was the reason she was so angry with me.

After feeling hurt and confused, I confronted her. She admitted that she was frustrated that I had ""stolen"" him, and in her fit of rage exclaimed:

""It's just a joke! You both look like a circus act when you kiss!""

She went on a pretty long rant about how there were few guys for tall girls like her to date as it is and pickings were slim enough without ""midgets"" stealing all the tall men. (She is 6 feet tall)

We had a falling out (over a separate issue) and never ended up talking again.

I'll never forget what she said though. We look like a ""circus act"" when we kiss. How dare we be together! I mean, fuck us for pursuing true love, right?

I know that the men on this subreddit seem to experience prejudice and hurtful comments from pretty much every person in life, but I'm wondering if the girls here could answer something for me:

**Is it mostly girls that give you a hard time about your height? Because I've got to be honest, it's never the guys that put me down the hardest or shoot through my self esteem the worst. It almost always seems to be the women in my life.**

I fit in these spaces much better than all the other techs :D. Think about trying to install a 500 lb gear transmittal in the space of your freezer. 

Thanks for reading!

I proposed this idea few days ago over [**here**](http://www.reddit.com/r/short/comments/z3pyc/picture_thread_would_anyone_be_interested/). I didn't get many replies but the ones that did reply said that it was a good idea so I made this post.


The idea is simple. Everyone shares their picture so that everyone else can put a face to the username (if that makes sense). This is optional, if you're not comfortable sharing your picture on an online forum then don't!


**Rules**

* Post pictures of yourself or of people you know (only if they gave you permission.)
* ***No nudes!***


Pictures can be of you doing (almost) anything! You wanna show off how short you are? Post your picture here! You want to know the opinion of subreddit about those pants you bought? Post the picture here and we will give our opinion! You want to start a rate-me thread? Well, I would prefer that you went to /r/rateme but you can still post your picture here! 

It is for all kind of pictures. 

**EDIT** Sort the comments by NEW so you see the latest pictures posted on top of the page!


____________________________



Edit: I haven't had any bad incidents in other forums where I moderated and every single one of them had one of these threads. It is always fun as long as people are not rude. However, if you think that this is somehow a bad idea then please let me know why and I will take this thread down!

Romulo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_P._Romulo) (5'4""), a Filipino ""diplomat, statesman, soldier, journalist and author."" According to the article:

&gt;In later years, Rómulo told another story himself about a meeting with MacArthur and other tall American generals who disparaged his physical stature. ""Gentlemen,"" he declared, ""When you say something like that, you make me feel like a dime among nickels.""

This reminded me of a quote made by the dwarf Tyrion Lannister (Game of Thrones), asserting that his mind was his weapon; as he later proved, it was a very powerful weapon indeed. I've worked my entire (albeit brief) life to sharpen my mind and ensure that I was never seen as having less value due to my height. I wouldn't say that I was compensating, as my ambition is a fundamental part of who I am. It would exist regardless of my height. My height (primarily the bullying which came with it) simply pushed me to accomplish my goals regardless of my stature. This next portion may sound arrogant, but please understand that I have struggled for everything I have achieved (once again, not too much). In terms of scores alone, I'm easily one of the top students in my school, and in the country. That is one reason my teacher believed I would find meaning in this quote, especially since I was the only junior enrolled in the course. I've also worked to become a very funny person, to the point where most people consider me ""hilarious."" That really means something to me, considering that in Elementary School I was the kid who didn't have any friends, who was picked on for being smaller than everyone else. 

I [understand](http://www.reddit.com/r/short/comments/1i8osl/fighting_the_media_image/) full well that simply making ourselves stronger in areas not related to our height won't be enough to dismantle heightism, but at the same time we can't allow these physical limitations to completely dictate our lives, right? Being able to love yourself is the first step to fighting the social stigma against us. If we can't do that, we may as well just curl up and die.

-Kissing without bending my neck backwards.

-Him being insanely cuddly and cute. Makes it really hard for me to keep my hands off of him, but I try to limit that a bit when we're out in public :)

Seriously, there are some girls out there who are literally advocating for the genocide of short-men, open hatred of short-men, sterilization of short men, and even Nazi-type eugenics to be imposed to men who are of a short stature.

It's a societal taboo to advocate and say such terrible, cruel and evil comments for other genetic characteristics that people have no control over e.g. race, skin color, genetic diseases etc. but somehow it's perfectly fine for people to do so with height. It makes me absolutely furious that this type of discrimination exists in the world, considering how far we've come from the era where racism, segregation and intolerance was once rampant and is now looked down upon with disgust. Also i find it so amusing that some people on that twitter page are so ignorant that they even demand short guys to be taller, as if it's something we can control, as if we have a choice in the matter.

I understand that some women might not find short men to be attractive, that's perfectly fine, and I accept that. But this type of cruel bigotry, hatred and discrimination aimed towards short men is simply unacceptable in a modern, civilized society. To think that in a society where a comment containing even slightly racial connotations can cause a public uproar; that these type of extremely vitriolic comments are viewed as okay, is unbelievable and a disgraceful disappointment.

the old picture thread is in the sidebar, but I recently noticed that it's now unfortunately over six months old, and for that reason can no longer be posted in. It's staying there for the time being so you can see /r/short's founding fathers and original members, but since it's been archived I thought it was about time we stuck up another one! :)

The idea is simple. Everyone shares their picture so that everyone else can put a face to the username (if that makes sense). This is optional, if you're not comfortable sharing your picture on an online forum then don't!

**Rules**

- Post pictures of yourself or of people you know (only if they gave you permission.)

- ***No nudes!***

Pictures can be of you doing (almost) anything! You wanna show off how short you are? Post your picture here! You want to know the opinion of subreddit about those pants you bought? Post the picture here and we will give our opinion! You want to start a rate-me thread? Well, I would prefer that you went to /r/rateme but you can still post your picture here!

It is for all kinds of pictures.

Thank you.",,False,self,t5_2sgvi,False,,green,True,t3_1b2vs5,http://www.reddit.com/r/short/comments/1b2vs5/picture_thread_2_post_your_pictures_here_optional/,

""I know that if I was 6'1"" or 6'2"", I'd be full of myself. I know that even if I was tall, I'd never be happy--because I could still be taller."" 

This really changed my whole perspective on being short. We can sit around wishing and whining about how we could use a few extra inches, but the reality is, we'll never get them. And even if we did, would we really be happy? Think about it. It's human nature to always want more, more, more. I'm 5'3"". If the fates were kind enough to grant me another 5 inches of height, I'd be 5'8"". And then I might think ""Wow, I wish I was 6' instead of this measly 5'8"","" ad infinitum. Not to say tall people are full of themselves--it's just that feeling that ""Oh, just a little more will make me feel better,"" when in reality, it wouldn't. What will make you feel better is being comfortable in your own skin. How can you lead a happy life if you're always dissatisfied with yourself? Instead of constantly being jealous of tall guys, we need to be proud of ourselves. Don't encourage a Napoleon complex, but don't be dissuaded by dickheads who see height as a measure of status.

1361312780.0,28,self.short,18ugd8,[Mod Post] In regards to a recent thread.,44,16,153,http://www.reddit.com/r/short/comments/18ugd8/mod_post_in_regards_to_a_recent_thread/,"In regards to a recent post, the other mods and I want to make something very clear. One thing people in this subreddit need to realize this this is r/short, not r/shortmen. There are women in this subreddit too, and recent posts have called out the women of this subreddit without much cause. A specific example being the recent post title “Sometimes opposites attract.” 

As a female moderator of a growing subreddit, I for one feel ill thinking of the treatment that women occasionally go through on this subreddit, especially when they post something along the lines of them being with a taller individual. I am curious to see the reaction if someone said it was a friend who was so much taller, rather than an SO, or if there would be a different reaction if the height difference wasn’t so drastic.

 It is behavior like this that gives our subreddit a bad name, and I for one want to work with this community to erase that behavior. I know that is a big task, and next to impossible because of freedom of speech. What I’m proposing is stop attacking people for what they post, ESPECIALLY if a woman posts that she is dating a taller man. I am opening this up for discussion, because I want this subreddit to be an enjoyable place for everyone, regardless of height, gender, and partner-height, whatever. 

No woman should ever feel afraid to post something on a subreddit they feel comfortable in with fear of being yelled at or told they are pouring salt in the wounds. I can understand if the posts were stating something like ‘Look how much taller my boyfriend is compared to you!’ That doesn’t happen, and if it does, the other mods and I work hard to remove it and control the situation. Please, I ask you all, remember that the people on this subreddit are just that, they are PEOPLE.

If a post is truly malicious, then please, report it, but don’t downvote something into oblivion just because someone wants to share a joyous moment in their life.

I know this is a highly sensitive subject, and am prepared for the disagreements and possible complaints. The mods would like to keep this as a discussion and see what people think about this process.

I also remind you all to be sure to follow [reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) when posting/voting.",,False,self,t5_2sgvi,False,,green,True,t3_18ugd8,http://www.reddit.com/r/short/comments/18ugd8/mod_post_in_regards_to_a_recent_thread/,moderator

So, I dug up this [old blog entry](http://thesocialcomplex.tumblr.com/post/16582277861/the-confidence-trap) I made last year about this topic and decided to post it here for those who are confused by why some people feel that the subreddit shouldn't become a place for positive content purely for the sake of positivity.

**The Confidence Trap**


There seems to be a plethora of guidance and advice on the internet for short people.  However, only a scant percentage of this advice is anti-heightist in nature.  In fact, most of the advice makes no acknowledgment of heightism whatsoever.   Instead, people who criticize short people (under the guise of encouragement or advice) focus on some perceived hidden virtue which short people are said to generally lack – a virtue that has nothing to do with height.  Usually, after much anecdotal evidence suggesting the inferiority of shorter people, this virtue is revealed to be “confidence” or “self-esteem”. 

Granted, confidence is indeed an important key to the success of any person who operates in a modern society.  Believing in one’s self and one’s abilities makes social interactions smoother, and it probably increases the quality of a person’s performance and her perceived abilities.  However, can one say that confidence should be more important to shorter people than to those who are taller?  Mustn’t the anti-heightism argument say that short people need only the same amount of confidence that other people supposedly posses?  And how does one measure “confidence” anyway?

The fact is that the “confidence argument” is merely a technique to diffuse and direct attention away from the social problem that is heightism.  Telling short people that they lack a magical and hidden virtue having nothing to do with height, which cannot be measured in an unbiased way, is a form of blame-shifting.  By convincing short people that the social stigma which we face is imaginary, and actually the result of an inner defect, society takes the impetus for change away from the perpetrators of bigotry and hoists it onto the shoulders of those who are victimized.

Short people should be confident.  But this is no solution because all people should be confident.  The justification for the additional confidence that short people are suggested to acquire (or that short people are perceived to lack) is the result of the social construct which turns physical “tallness” into a virtue and devalues people who are perceived to embody a lack of this trait as inferior.

In fact, confident short people are often labeled as arrogant because society perceives short people as having little of which to be confident about.  Heightism clouds the talents and abilities of those who are short in relation to those who are taller and so the confidence which emanates from a short person is often regarded as “false” or “inauthentic”.

So, society implores us to increase our self-confidence in a bid of cultural blame-shifting; and then, when we display this added confidence, we are shamed as being overconfident.  This is another catch-22 that short people would do well to avoid. 

The key is not confidence.  The key is social justice.  And the issue is heightism. ",,False,self,t5_2sgvi,False,,blue,True,t3_1ggxgu,http://www.reddit.com/r/short/comments/1ggxgu/the_confidence_trap/,

[Gender make-up of /r/short](http://imgur.com/51kJrnP)

[Height make-up](http://imgur.com/myhl7fU) quick note on this, I went by feet instead of feet and inches. So while it looks like there's a huge spike at 5 foot nothing, really that's a spike of people whose height is 5 foot something.

[Shoe size (american measurement)](http://imgur.com/9GopiRJ)

[Inseam](http://imgur.com/zQKyK72) I did this one in threes, since there was practically no one in between 15-24, or 36-39. Once those were done in threes it worked better if the whole thing was :)

[Relationship status](http://imgur.com/0jyTr53) I wote ""dingle"" as the first result, but I'm sure you can figure out what I meant to put down ;) and best of luck to the 1.02% of us who are engaged!

[Age of virginity loss](http://imgur.com/syygL6t) I got a lot of messages saying this was an unnecessary/creepy/I should kill myself question, so sorry about that folks! And over a third of you skipped this one, so fair enough i'll keep questions of this calibre out of any and all future surveys.

[How often is your height commented on?](http://imgur.com/sPkhjKX)

For the ""how do you believe your height has affected you"" question, most of the results I got were about clothes shopping and the lack of a dating pool, but some of the positive answers I received were about sport and having a lower centre of gravity! Then some people just said they believed it had no effect.

I really like David Sedaris. There was this one time on This American Life when he told a story from when he was growing up. In his house in NC someone in his family had taken to wiping their ass after a deuce with the face, hand or bath towels. Actually wiping the poop off their buttholes with the fabric towels and then neatly hanging them back up. Worst/best part...all of the towels in their house were fudge colored. So they would be drying their face or hair and an unmistakable odor would descend upon them as they realized they were wiping someone's doodoo on their face and hair. So this whole story was presented as a mystery or detective story as he tried to figure out who it was in their family that was wiping their ass on the family towels. He ends the story and didn't know at the time he wrote it who the guilty party was. On Tuesday I saw him give a lecture in Santa Barbara and he did a book signing after. I had him sign his new book for me (he drew a picture of an owl in it too, pretty rad) and I asked him if there had been any developments in the case since it aired about ten or so years ago. It had been cracked. Turns out it was his grandmother! She was a mean old cuss and would come visit from the old folk's home on the weekends and was pissed she had to go back. So she did it to stick it to the fam. True story.

Every girl I've been with or had intimacies with has been taller than me. Hell, my first ever girlfriend was almost a foot taller. This isn't a particular preference, it is just a coincidence.

Those who have strict height requirements are not worth our time. Let them miss out on our beastly sexual prowess.


My dad, an inch smaller than myself, is my role model. He came to London as an 18yr old, found something he wanted to pursue and stuck at it. In a world where the big men stand tallest, he fucking frog leaped the competition and has become very successful as a result. If I could be like him then I will be a happy man.

As the video explains, the media image of what a woman is expected to look like puts an unbelievable amount of pressure on young girls. They obsess over their weight, and many are diagnosed with eating disorders. Not only that, but according video, the majority of young women are discontent with their appearance, resulting in low self-esteem and depression. As much of a problem as this is, it has not gone without a counter movement. Aside from the ""Fat Acceptance"" movement, which receives quite a bit of criticism on reddit, there have been numerous other efforts to discredit what the media claims attractive women should look like, such as [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYhCn0jf46U) video from Dove, brilliantly portraying that the women the media idolizes do not exist, but have been digitally enhanced to appear more attractive. Even at my school, quite a few clubs and groups fight the shallow image of beauty given to us by the media, and many efforts are made to reassure young women that they are not as unattractive as the media would have them believe.

I'm not criticizing this, I'm simply wondering why the same hasn't been done for the sake of we short folk. Heightism is an undeniable part of our culture. Tall people get [paid](http://www.livescience.com/5552-taller-people-earn-money.html) [more](http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/200310/tall-people-get-paid-more) for the same work, and get more respect. Being short is also a disadvantage in terms of getting a [promotion](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/height-bias-found-in-us-hiring-promotion-practices), [job](http://epubs.utah.edu/index.php/ulr/article/viewFile/246/218), raise, or whatever else have you. There is also, of course, the effect of the media image that men should be tall, and that real women don't date short men. It's that last effect which seems to be discussed most on /r/short. And yet, it seems that nothing is being done. If you even try to mention heightism outside of this and the more open minded subs, you'll either be laughed at, or told to get over it. I understand that those who tell us to [accept](http://www.reddit.com/r/short/comments/1i6049/being_short_doesnt_stop_you_from_doing_anything/) our height and make the best of what we have are simply trying to break our depressed attitude, but that advice will do more harm than good. Accepting injustice and trying to change yourself won't help. When you get passed up for a job and a taller, less qualified candidate is hired, holding your head high and accepting your height won't pay your bills. I'm not saying that you should be depressed and feel worthless, but in addition there needs to be actual change in our society, and for that, action must be taken to tear down this media image of Tall=attractive/capable. I understand I'm certainly not the first to espouse this point of view on the sub, but this is and idea which needs to be reinforced.

I just found this subreddit this morning and I think it's really nice to find this community.

As it says in the title I am a teacher, or rather I'm currently a student teacher at a high school. I love my students and the whole community at my school. The only thing that bothers me is that I sometimes get confused for one of the students even though I dress professionally. It confused me until I asked someone why they thought I was a student and the snaked around saying it but it came down to the fact that I am short.

The thing that makes up for this is that my students really respect me on top of thinking i'm a badass (their words, not mine haha) because I have a very large personality. This leads to me having more control over my classroom than my cooperating teacher.

Just thought i'd share a bit of my story with some people who might appreciate it. :)

I'm kind of wondering if maybe I misinterpreted things?

Someone in the education subreddit described their poor experience with their administration (admin let a student graduate and changed the earned grade of an F into a passing grade because the student was a major football player at the school) and quitting. Someone else responded with their own story from being kind of on the outside of the situation as a student who had to defend a teacher from being fired because a student in her class earned a failing grade and the student's parent had sway within the school board. This person said: 

&gt;Now, I was a football player, and in HS I very much looked the part. 6' and 225-ish and solid muscle. This guy, who was 5-foot nothing and in his early 50s, stood up and tried to get in my face. He even asked if I ""wanted to step outside"" which elicited a pretty hearty laugh from our school principal. 

To which my response was:

&gt;Just an aside - I totally agree that this dad was an arrogant jerk, but his height compared to yours shouldn't make any kind of a difference, as it is not a relevant point to your story. Trying to point out how 'ridiculous' the situation is by including that unnecessary detail makes it seem like you're saying he didn't know his place as a short old man, even though I'm certain you don't mean it that way. Additionally, saying ""five foot nothing"" as opposed to ""around five feet"" also gives it this tainted disgusting unworthy aspect that you have attached to being short.

&gt;Consistent slurs directed at short people, combined with consistent putting down and some particularly inaccurate stereotypes people give to short people appear all of the time in our society, and it can get to be some pretty heavy discrimination sometimes.

She then went on this (to me) insane diatribe about how tall people are more respected, and other shit you've all probably heard way to often. After this she turned to me and said ""No offense, disastourism."" 

I've experienced tons of height discrimination from girls and such as a 5'5"" straight dude, but I'd never seen anyone get so worked up over the notion that their kids might be short. It was seriously weird. It also made me vindictively wish that she'd have short kids.

The thing that pissed me off the most though was that it never even occurred to her that I would actually find that offensive (I did). I wonder how many people are similarly insensitive, not because they're assholes, but because it never crossed their mind that someone could be offended by their words. Also I was ripping bad that someone that considers me a friend would completely disregard my feelings like that.

What I'm really wondering is if I'm being to sensitive, or if I actually should be this pissed off. I think part of it is that this came from a friend who I thought would consider my feelings more than she did.

In my experience (and I'm only speaking from my own experience here) the opposite has been true. I've found that short men tend to go out of their way to be nice to others. Many (including myself) are often too passive, too accepting of bad treatment. We don't stand up for ourselves enough.

So it's weird when I hear people make reference to ""Napoleon Complex."" I just haven't seen it in my life. But something struck me today: maybe it's not that the complex exists, but that people expect a certain behaviour from short men. People think that short men *should* be passive, *should* be accommodating and not stand up for themselves. So when a short guy does stand up for himself, it goes against their expectations and they don't like it, and respond with this labeling. We're supposed to play in our role which has certain rules.

I think it's similar to how women are often expected to be passive and not display assertiveness or aggression. And if they do, many people will label them as a bitch for the same behaviour that is accepted from a male (a tall male anyway!)

What do you think?

I also found a related study on [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleon_complex#Research):

&gt; In 2007, research by the University of Central Lancashire suggested that the Napoleon complex (described in terms of the theory that shorter men are more aggressive to dominate those who are taller than they are) may be a myth. The study discovered that short men (below 1.65 m (5 ft 5 in)) were less likely to lose their temper than men of average height. The experiment involved subjects dueling each other with sticks, with one subject deliberately rapping the other's knuckles. Heart monitors revealed that the taller men were more likely to lose their tempers and hit back. University of Central Lancashire lecturer Dr Mike Eslea commented that ""when people see a short man being aggressive, they are likely to think it is due to his size, simply because that attribute is obvious and grabs their attention.""[2]",,False,self,t5_2sgvi,False,,blue,True,t3_1h1mt5,http://www.reddit.com/r/short/comments/1h1mt5/some_thoughts_on_napoleon_complex/,

I think it's because I really thought about it, and what it meant was a girl I thought liked me literally valued an inanimate object over me, a human being.

The director borrows heavily from Plato’s “The Republic” and “The Matrix”, but this animated short film is still definitely worth seeing. (run time: 16:34, requires Flash, and NSFW).

1375375163.0,23,self.short,1ji4jh,A scientific study that proves Self Deprecating humor is counter-productive and harmful,31,8,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/short/comments/1ji4jh/a_scientific_study_that_proves_self_deprecating/,"The topic of self-depcreating humor has come up a view times and it still seems like there's a few holdouts in this subreddit who can't be persuaded to see how pointless it is and how it actually only furthers perpetuates heightism.  I won't rehash those arguments here but you can see my submission history for the main discussion, which since then has at least anecdotally been confirmed by a few people on this subreddit.


[This psychological study looked at the relationship between self deprecating humor vs other types of humor on short term and long term attractiveness](http://www.psychologytoday.com/files/attachments/95822/self-deprecating-humor-is-sexually-attractive.pdf)

You don't have to read the whole thing, though I suggest looking at some of the figures.  The main takeaway points are:


&gt;In particular, self- deprecating humor was much more attractive than other-deprecating humor when used by high-status potential mates, for both male and female raters. When used by low-status potential mates, there was little difference in long-term attractiveness between self- and other-deprecating humor.
We theorize that high-status individuals can more easily afford to make fun of themselves.

and 

&gt;Thus, the use of self- deprecating humor by low-status individuals may be counter-productive, suggesting depression, defeatism, subordination, low self-esteem, and/or low mate value. On the other hand, if an individual has achieved high social status, they are unlikely to have truly low conscientiousness, extraversion, or emotional stability, and they must show reasonable agreeableness often enough to make friends and win support. Thus, self-deprecating humor may be a way of transiently faking inferior personally traits, to highlight the discrepancy between the faked traits (e.g., introversion, neuroticism) and the traits actually required to win high status.


Granted they weren't referring to height in this study but based on the way society views height it's pretty easy to apply this to that context where according to society short stature = low status and tall stature = high status.

I hope that is enough to satisfy the holdouts!  You aren't doing yourself any favors with self-deprecating humor.  ",,False,self,t5_2sgvi,1375375432.0,,,True,t3_1ji4jh,http://www.reddit.com/r/short/comments/1ji4jh/a_scientific_study_that_proves_self_deprecating/,

There is humor to be found in certain traits, maybe red hair, weight, or a big nose, but **height self deprecation is extremely counterproductive**.  While you may get some laughs, the laughs come at a price.  In the context of courtship, particularly male to female courtship, nothing dries up and slams shut a vagina like making fun of your own short stature.  You might get some chuckles out of it, but all you are doing is reinforcing societies archetype of short men as ""adorable and platonically safe"" at best, and a ""sexless and undesirable entity"" at worse.  Really.  Once you've wooed a girl, then there is more room for this -- for instance i've made jokes about not being able to reach the top shelf to my girlfriend, but I never would have done this when I first met her -- but stay the hell away from this type of humor when you first meet, on the first few dates, etc.  Self deprecation is generally counterproductive regardless of how you are making fun of yourself, because it's the opposite of confidence, but is especially toxic when referring to components and traits that society defines as masculine. I'm not fond of the alpha/beta binary division that some use to refer to classifying men, as I believe it is oversimplified and somewhat pseudoscience, but there is little doubt that behaviors associated with ""beta"" men, including over indulgence of self deprecation, is extremely off-putting to women.

The second context is in the field of interpersonal relations, related to those in a business related setting.  And this applies to men just as much as it does to women.  Unfortunately, a combination of evolved human psychology and societal brainwashing causes many to automatically perceive higher stature individuals as more capable leaders, and smaller stature individuals as less so.  By making self deprecating remarks regarding height in any kind of leadership setting, all you are doing is subconsciously adding fuel to the fire in these attitudes, and again while you may get some cheap laughs, any marginal benefit you might see as funny is easily eclipsed by the negative subconscious spotlight you put on yourself by bringing attention to your small stature.  


Thirdly, by making comments you are tacitly approving the use of heightist jokes and attitudes.  Similarly to the now much regretted comedy sketch that Chris Rock made about the difference between black people and ""niggers"", by you, a short individual, making short jokes, you are telling people that it is *okay* to make jokes about height and thus altering their perception of heightism from a serious subject to one that cannot be as serious, if height ridicule is indulged by a supposed victim of it.  Oh I know, you may think you're just 'joking around' with your friends, and it may start out as a friendly barb, but the exchanges will never truly be tit for tat as there is very little chance what trait you are joking about them is perceived as negatively as short stature, and each joke collectively makes society perceive heightist behavior as less taboo than it should be.  Only by taking a firm stance against these jokes, and never, ever indulging in them can we hope to elevate heightist behavior and remarks to e level of taboo that racism and sexism currently resides in. Rightly or wrong, society interprets the appropriateness of a behavior or action based on the consequences of on that action in a punitive sense.  When heightist remarks are as much grounds for termination by Human Resources as racist and sexist ones are, society will start to interpret them just as seriously.  Obviously that progress is interrupted by tacitly approving it with self deprecating jokes related to the matter.  Hardline feminists catch a lot of flack, but the ones who made real progress starting 50 years ago did so with a zero tolerance policy for such misogynist behavior, and have succeeded in making it more taboo than not.  That is what I hope can be accomplished with heightist behavior and remarks, but only if such a similar collective zero tolerance policy is practiced, and that starts with ourselves.",,False,self,t5_2sgvi,False,,,True,t3_1hrakt,http://www.reddit.com/r/short/comments/1hrakt/just_a_reminder_but_height_self_deprecation_is/,

This is a strong study that gives very strong evidence against a lot of armchair evolutionary biology that you hear regarding dating and height. What you often hear, in terms of dating for men especially, is that women “are evolutionarily predisposed to loving men that can protect them.” Next time, instead of arguing that modern society does not require protect, just tell them that is bunk! Think about this following study done by Australian researchers in 2011. The basic premise rests on this: if sexual preference for height is genetic, then twins should more likely than not select mates that are the same height more so often than siblings that are not twins. 

Please see figure 1 (http://imgur.com/pRM3u).
Key: 
MZF: female twin
MZM: Male twin
DZF: Female sibling, not twin
DZM: Male sibling, not twin
there are two numbers, X(Y). X=the correlation. I.e. .2=20%. Y=the significance. .05 is usually standard, but this article chose (.01) instead, which is much more strict. Thus, .02(.07) means that there is a low correlation with a confidence of 93% that there .02 is a real statistic rather than just chance.

*There are 3 key points that you should know!*

**1)Preference for height is not genetic**

This study looks at a sample of &gt;20,000 twins to determine if these people had similar choices in their dating habits. The study concluded that “Correlation between twin pair partners was not significant for BMI, height, and all personality scales, but there were small but significant correlations between twin pair partners for education, income, religiosity, attitudes, and age”  (mate choice heritability = 5% for males and 8% for females, respectively). 

**2)Preference for height is not based on a Female Father’s height**

 “In particular, the sexual imprinting hypothesis was not supported: twins’ spouses showed no more similarity to the twin’s opposite-sex parent than would be expected given assortative mating and genetic relatedness between a twin and his or her parent. A strong previous demonstration of sexual imprinting was subsequently found to contain serious errors (Bereczkei et al. 2009).”

**3) When parents influence who you find attractive, it tends to be for age and income**

“This family environment effect, which explains 18% and 25% of the variance in mate choice for age and income, respectively, may reflect parental influence over mating decisions. “

**Next week:** Clearly, current data shows women prefer tall men. Why? What does that mean? The truth is, women actually aren't looking for height, but *something MORE IMPORTANT* This will be discussed next week!

My mom apparently doesn't give a hoot and just opens that door without a warning. It goes *woosh* over my head, and hits my sister on her head instead.

I was the perfect height. My cupboards are literally just about 2 mm higher than me and will never hit me in the head. I like being short!

1375439524.0,21,self.short,1jk20h,My experiences about height during my study abroad semester in Africa,22,1,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/short/comments/1jk20h/my_experiences_about_height_during_my_study/,"I mentioned on [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/short/comments/1jew6r/does_it_feel_really_bad_when_you_have_to_go/) that I had some insights regarding height when I went abroad last semester. I figured I would share it in case anyone had an interest in this topic. I tend to write way too much when I post, so just a fair warning there.

I was originally supposed to spend my semester in Copenhagen, Denmark. I backed out at the very last second (2 weeks before I was supposed to go) and decided to apply to a different location. The reason for the change was primarily my changed interest in cultures, experiences, and academics between when I applied and when I decided to cancel the study abroad program, but the concern of me being noticeably short played a small role. Although my height concerns played no role in where I decided to apply to next, I ended up going to a West African country instead, where the average male height is 5'6.5'' (incidentally my height). Here are a couple of things I remember regarding height while I was there:

* Our study abroad group was majority female (85%+). The range of height was so large (4'11''-6'0'') and there were so many people that I thought it was true representation of average female height in America.

* I was surprised to find that short men were [over]represented well among our study abroad students. Of our group there were six of us Americans who were pretty much the same height (5'6''-5'7''), two who were almost exactly average at 5'9.5''-5'10.5'', and four who were various ranges of above average height (5'11''-6'2''). There was no one shorter than me and no outliers in height. Outside of the dorms there was one guy of average height and one who was taller than average. I wondered if there were others who came here because they didn't feel comfortable going abroad to European countries, but I never asked.

* African men attending the university (which was the school with the highest prestige and international appeal in the country) were either much taller (&gt;6') than me or much shorter than me (&lt;5'3''), there were fewer men with heights 1''-2'' of my own. The range of heights was very large and the mode definitely did not seem to be in the 5'6'' territory. Outside the university, and especially outside the main city, I was taller than ~60-75% of the men there.

* Heels were the requirement for a lot of the nightclubs in the city. Even in the clubs without this requirement, heels were the predominant type of footwear for the women. The student body at the university had a reputation for being among the most fashion forward students in Africa. Students usually dressed formally, but almost no one wore heels to class - not even small or ""kitten"" heels. Wedges and boots were completely absent. Flats and sandals were pretty much the only type of shoes I saw on the female students. About a 1/3 of the men wore shoes with heels, but I did not notice any pattern of height among the wearers. The rest wore sandals, sneakers, or flat driving shoes.

* I noticed that the taller men were almost exclusively from the elite class of society (wealthy students from neighboring countries, princes-in-name-only of traditional areas in the country, sons of government officials/politicians, etc.). From what I saw these were the only men (with a few exceptions) who hooked-up with white foreigners (for the most part) or Black Americans. A good number of these men had a reputation for hooking up with a lot of new foreign Americans every semester. By and large, western/westernized American women who did hook up with African men, did so exclusively with tall (6'+) African men. I feel weird mentioning this, but this point was pretty clear and very out in the open.

* The shorter men were the ones who came from working class or middle class families and were usually the ones paying their own way. The shorter men who did have relationships with foreign women were usually with African American women (meaning these women were the daughters of first generation immigrants to America who came back to study abroad in Africa for a semester, and they usually still had good family ties to the area). The primary difference was that these relationships seemed to be genuine, sustained relationships rather than the relationships above which were pretty much identical to the American hook up culture. I can only recall one relationship that involved a taller, white American woman (~5'8''-5'9'') and a shorter, African man (5'5''-5'6''). There was also one relationship between a white American woman and a light-skinned African man where the couple was near the same height (5'5''-5'8''), but the man was still taller by about an inch or two.

* There were a few African women that were my height or close to it, but the vast majority were shorter than me by at least 2 inches. I think the women who were my height were in the same position as the taller men I talked about above. I can only remember two cases of meeting women taller than me, and even they were 5'8''-5'9'' max. 

* Among African couples I saw in school, height seemed to play very little factor. I routinely saw women who were taller than their partners. I can honestly say that what I noticed among African couples throughout the university and the country deeply challenged the idea that the ""overwhelming male taller attraction norm"" was a biological preference rather than a social construct. I saw very few couples that had a large difference in height - in fact seeing couples that looked to be identical in height seemed to be more common than seeing couples where the man was 8''+ taller than the woman. This excludes the very tall men that I talked about above of course, there simply were no African women that approached their height from what I saw.

* When discussing the ""height aspect of dating in America"" many of my male African friends (tall, average, and short) were confused by why it so highly valued, although they did recognize that there were a couple of women in the country that spoke openly of a height preference. While some of my friends did mention a preference for ""petite"" women (which was by far the most common body type), most agreed that body size didn't matter too much (height or weight).

* I encountered no height jokes towards myself or others while I was there - and I usually notice those while in America. Even when the opportunity presented itself, for instance when a heated disagreement involved a tall and short man, height was not insulted (even though other things such as manner of speech, background, strength, reputation, etc. were fair game). Women that chided men never targeted their height.

* I saw no indication of there being a cultural trope of short men being prone to insecurity, anger, jealousy, etc. Nor did I see or sense any sense of entitlement, pride, or view that taller men were better leaders, partners, or ""masculine/confident men"".

This trip really solidified and reinforced my view that heightism and the great importance placed on height in the Western world (and the countries with very close ties to them ie. China and S. Korea) is a social construct rather a true outcome of innate biological drives. I am aware that some may say that I had a biased view while I was there due to my short height, but this is the truest reflection I can give on my time abroad. It took me going to a country where I felt height truly didn't matter to see that the people in America saying that height doesn't matter here as disingenuous - although some people are sincere in that statement, I still believe they are being ignorant of the true issue.

This prevents them from having to crane up to make eye contact, and it's always felt ""unladylike"" to tower over people, especially guys.  (In work situations, I'm always especially cautious to stand back when being introduced to men shorter than me.)

Interestingly enough, no tall men I know bother to do this.  They seem perfectly comfortable towering.  (But maybe that's a conversation for another subreddit.)

Anyway, so here's the dilemma.  I have a regular customer who is a little person.  She comes up to about my waist.  I don't want to ""tower"", but I would also have to stand across the room during a conversation to avoid making her look up at me.  And it feels like it would be really offensive to lean over.  (I mean, this is a grown woman, not a toddler.)

So, people of r/short...How do you want us SAP tall folk to handle face-to-face conversations?  Is towering preferable to standing awkwardly far back?  Is it ever acceptable to lean down a little?

I went from about 140 lbs. to 165. It is also nice to enjoy a sport where my height can be advantageous.

I have done a lot of different programs... Stronglifts, Texas Method, and now a Chaos&amp;Pain method for squats. 

I don't ""feel"" as short as I was before, even though my height has not changed. I am lot stronger than most of my peers regardless of their height and I feel more secure with myself.

Some of my taller friends took notice of the changes in my body over the past months and have solicited me for workout advice a lot. It feels good to be perceived in a positive light like this.

It is hard to feel small/weak when I can deadlift 315 pounds. I really recommend weightlifting to anybody who feels physically small, even if you're not short, but just skinny/insecure/aging, it can do wonders for your confidence.

People are also a lot more respectful now, and I am a little more confrontational. A while back I was at an arcade and there was a rude man (much larger than me) yelling/swearing very loudly while playing a game. 10~15 people stood by and watched and nobody said anything... I went up to him and said ""You need to keep your voice down."" and he responded very positively and apologized (then kept his voice down.) I would not have seen myself being able to do this in a million years if it weren't for all my new confidence.

There a lot of talented athletes of all shapes/sizes at my gym... Some of the shortest guys are the most terrifying of all. One of my female friends from high school recently front-squatted 225 lbs, and she's barely five feet tall.

I highly recommend weightlifting to anybody... I have never been athletic at all in my life and my recent interest has changed my life completely.

The conversation went something like this.

---

**Woman #1:** Have we ever told you about our friend Tom?

**Me:** No, tell me about him.

**Woman #1:** He's a guy that hangs out with us some time.  The girls like him but the guys hate him.

**Me:** Why?

**Woman #1:** Guys don't like him because he is constantly arguing with them about something or another.  He also turns everything into a competition with other guys, like, he will try to one-up guys about everything.  If he loses a game of pool, he won't talk to you for the rest of the night, and might even punch a wall because he is so angry.                                                                       He also will insults guys all the time.

**Me:**  Well, why do women like him?

**Woman #2:** Well, he always seems to know what we're thinking, and knows what's wrong when we had a bad day.  He'll come up to us and give us a back rub, and be super friendly with us.

**Woman #1:**  I can see why guys wouldn't like him because of how confrontational and arrogant he is, but he's different with women.

**Guy Friend:**  Yeah, he turns everything into a competition and can't relax.  It's kind of annoying.  Especially when you want to just relax, have a drink, and enjoy company.

**Me:**  He's REALLY tall isn't he?

**Woman #1:**  YES!  He's 6' 4"" tall.  How did you know that!?

**Me:**  Because a short man would never be able to get away with behavior like that.

**Woman #2:** That's just a good guess.

I probably like most guys here had an issue with my height, weight, look (Asian). I was always unsuccessful with girls, and felt my height and probably race played a huge part of my problem. 

Two years ago I started crossfit and immediately I realised that my height disadvantage became the advantage and I quickly excelled. Lifting weights was relatively easy because I didn't have to lift it as high as the taller guys, doing pull-ups and burpees were easier because I was lighter.
Before i knew it, I fell in love with exercise, eating right and I just became a lot more confident in who I was. 

I'm not sure if its because if my body change or my renewed confidence that girls have started to pay attention to me. For someone whose never had any attention from any girl this is amazing!

Anyways I wanted to give my friends a shout out to all my friends in /r/short that you just need to find some thing you love doing, excel at it, and your height is so easily forgotten. 

I never really understood what women meant when they liked confident guys, but I'm starting to understand. Just being happy, passionate and living with conviction in something makes you attractive to the opposite sex.

I don't consider height a problem anymore.

I've been lurking around here for maybe a few months and I've posted a few harmless things here and there over the past few weeks. I'm shorter than the majority of men but taller than the majority of women where I live (Montreal). I rarely experience overt heightism but I definitely feel that respect and height come hand in hand sometimes.

Now that that's over, I wanted to talk about something. I've noticed that some people say this sub is too depressing or has made them more self-conscious about their height. Admittedly, there are some defeatist/unhealthy views that have been expressed here and at first I did start paying more attention to my height. This, however, does not represent the entire subreddit or what this place means to me. 

I've seen many insightful and intelligent posts from some of the older frequenters, and I feel that they are both positive and realistic. Here's an example:

""I think we're mistaken in trying to pursue happiness. There are few people who can sustain happiness, and those people are usually endowed with remarkable gifts that ensure other people treat them well, regardless of their own personality.

I think for the rest of us, a good aim in life is to find peace with ourselves and others. To be okay with ourselves. And that's as much as we can hope for. I think I'm getting to that place myself. I hope you can too.

You aren't alone - there are others like you. Know at the very least that I and the other people of /r/short care about you."" -Pubesauce

That was inspiring and beautiful. I feel like I actually gain wisdom from being on here. We need to focus more on shit like this, we need to talk about our accomplishments and show each other that we won't let society's perception of our height break us.

Here are the things on this sub that I like and think we should continue to focus on:

1. posts about awesome famous short people

2. funny posts about being short

3. insightful posts about being short

4. posts exposing heightism 
Note: Yes these are depressing but I feel that it is important to expose the very real issue of heightism. You guys managed to show somebody the ill of their ways today to the point of them apologizing on this sub. That is genuinely impressive and it goes to show that we can make a positive change. I saw heightism as a bit of a fluff term before I saw some of the stuff on here, and I think it's opened my eyes and given me a new found respect for shorter people who I had maybe subconsciously seen myself as higher on the totem pole than. 

5. MOST IMPORTANTLY: posts showing off your accomplishments as a short person. Good at a sport? Got a great family? Got awesome skills? Show us that shit. (Also, if you guys gained anything from this post, I'm thinking of posting about the whole short girl w/ tall guy post controversy next time)

Anyways, I basically wanted to offer some feedback that I think would make this sub better and I also wanted to show that not everybody finds this place depressing and sort of offer a rebuttal for the people who bitch about it. It's up to all of us to post what we want; if we want to be negative and feed off each other's pity, so be it, but if we want to be something positive we can and have done that too. 

TLDR: If you don't like this subreddit, there's nothing stopping you from changing and it and you clearly haven't been reading deep enough into it.

For pretty much my entire life I've been made to feel insecure about my height. I was one of the tiniest kids in every class in school and I got picked on a lot because I was too small to fight back. Even close friends constantly poked fun at my size, knowing that I was insecure about it. I am also constantly mistaken for being younger than my actual age - commonly four to five years younger.

Ultimately, a lot of the teasing also affected my self-esteem; among other reasons, I felt as if I was unattractive because my physical size made me appear less mature. I was never described by anyone as ""hot"" - the most I would occasionally get was ""you look cute."" I hate that word. I constantly feel as if I am being treated like a child. It doesn't help that I also have a very young-looking face and practically no boobs. Whenever I first started dating my SO (who is 6'0""/183 cm) people would make jokes about how I was so young-looking it made him seem like a pedophile or cradle robber. Now I am approaching my 21st birthday; I applied to get a library card about two weeks ago, but the person at the desk assumed I was still in high school and needed a parent to get the card for me.

So my question to men on this subreddit would be, have you also felt that your shorter stature has made people talk down to you or patronize you as if you were still a juvenile? Or does it affect you in other ways? Do you feel like people still treat you like a boy, or is it something else?

**Edit: If your first instinct after seeing this post is to make a comment about how short people just need to suck it up or how tall people have issues too, don't.

[META]",34,13,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/short/comments/14yju1/can_we_dial_back_on_posts_dealing_with_the_dating/,"So, there has been a lot of posts here recently about whether short women are affected by heightism because short men are treated way worse by the opposite sex than short women.  May I suggest that this recent focus on dating and attraction with regard to short stature is actually distracting us from the greater problem?

So, society generally regards shorter people as less intelligent, less capable, less competent, less able to lead others or garner respect, less sociable, and less attractive (broadly speaking).  My theory as to why this is deals with gender norms and a socialization process which is widely fostered throughout our institutions, our families, and our interpersonal relationships with other adults.  In fact, the prejudice is so ubiquitous that most people do not register it as ""wrong"".  It ""seems natural"" because we are inculcated into social structures which define us by our height from a young age (think about the fact that we all start as children and adults are much taller than us and have authority over us during the period of time when our brains are developing and forming social rules).  Basically, for most people, grasping the concept of ""heightism"" is as difficult as it would be for a fish to understand the concept of ""wet"".  An entity which has never experienced the concept of ""dry"" would have much trouble understanding the concept of ""wet"".  

So, it's already very hard for us to understand the properties and mechanics of *heightism* without being distracted with only one effect of the greater prejudice.  By focusing on this dating issue, we are failing to understand how the stigma works.  And if this institutionalized prejudice is a social construct, which I suspect that it is, we cannot hope to ever challenge it if we are continuously side-tracked.     

And, I can already hear a lot of you guys saying ""I don't care about heightism, I only want to know how I can get women to date me!""  But, if you have that attitude, you have already lost.  You have missed the proverbial forest for all of the trees in the way.  Your higher rejection rate isn't heightism, *per se*, but it arises from the same social structures that you are trying to ignore.  Plus, focusing on ""the dating effect"" of heightism simply makes the entire prejudice look silly in the eyes of the general public.  Have you ever noticed how complaints of heightism are often met with a rhetorical pivot about women and attraction - even if the grievance had nothing to do with that?  The purpose of this argumentative technique is to make the prejudice look trivial and most of you are falling for it.  

So, am I full of shit here?  Shouldn't we be welcoming short women to the subreddit to enhance our understanding?

If you haven't complained to Snickers about their ""Bites"" ad campaign, then [you can do so here](http://www.snickers.com/Contact) (select ""other feedback"").  Talk is cheap.  It's time to actually do something when we see blatant heightism in the media.    

Once you send your complaint, post it here.  And if you've already sent your complaint, post it here.  If we get no response in a few days, then we'll try a different contact method.  Let's try to get a critical mass of people who comment about this ad campaign.  Force them to respond.  

Here is mine:

&gt;I’m writing in to let you know that the new ad campaign for “Snickers Bites"" is unnecessarily offensive.  It appears that the official tagline for this product line is “Smaller Size. No Inferiority Complex"".  This is essentially a form of body shaming in order to sell candy.  The Napoleon Complex myth is a false stereotype used to shame people because of their stature. 

&gt;Mars isn’t supposed to be engaging in “sexual stereotyping or ridicule"" (Mars Marketing Code - #8 “Advertising Guidelines"").  And as heightism is a prejudice based in gender norms, this tagline should be considered a clear violation of your marketing policy.  This is especially the case if the tagline refers to penis size and not height (as others have suggested). 

&gt;In any event, the use of this tagline is borderline shameful.  I always try to assume innocence and so I hope that this was a matter of ignorance instead of malice. 

&gt;Thanks.

**EDIT:** So, some people say that they haven't seen the ad.  [Here is one example of the ad.](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-2er2Weyu2jM/UaHmOD5fBCI/AAAAAAAAGaw/Wm6YR2PODT4/s1600/Maxim_USA_2013-06.page07.jpg).  It's apparently running as a print advertisement in various magazines and in online content.  But what's worse, this is apparently the official tagline for all Mars candies that are in the ""Bites"" format.  ""Smaller Size. No Inferiority Complex"".

Growing up in a Dutch-heavy Midwest city, where the average girl height is 5'6"", I get my fair share of short comments. You all know how it goes...So here's my question:


**I assume one of our main goals is raising awareness. Say that works, and height becomes a protected class, like race, gender, etc. Would that be enough to satisfy us?**


I assume not. Scouting around the subreddit, I get a sense that most people have suffered love and relationship issues from their stature. Even if our goal of raising self-awareness, ending wage discrimination, etc., works it won't make dating life any easier. Just like how interracial couples are still very rare, and in hush-hush talk, people will say that they can never see themselves in an interracial relationship. Likewise, maybe we can achieve the goal of making heightism not talked about in polite company, it would just migrate to hush-hush talk...


Completely unrelated to that question, I also wish to make some comments that you may ignore: 


* 1: I love when people tell us shorter folks to just deal with it. You make it sound like we have a choice ;-)


* 2: People also love to say ""be more confident!"" Recall how confidence works: successes builds confidence, leading to more successes. Are some short people successful? Yeah. I'm fairly successful. But it's an absurd amount of effort. You gotta be smarter, wittier, look better, dress better, talk more game, appear nicer, be at least equally strong (or stronger), etc., just to be on equal terms. 


* 3: Being short is tough, but being short and a minority (Asian) takes it to another level of challenge. Thank God I'm easy on the eyes, with frawress skin, and forever youthful looks (until 50 anyways). But Asians aren't the favored dating group around here...


* 4: As some other redditor have said, I must concur 100%: It's not that we have a problem with our stature (on most days...damn you item on the top shelf!), it's that other people have a problem with our stature.

1369154671.0,15,self.short,1ertlq,"Short guy (5'8"") who just discovered this subreddit. Let me vent a little.",64,49,314,http://www.reddit.com/r/short/comments/1ertlq/short_guy_58_who_just_discovered_this_subreddit/,"Let's be honest here. Most of guys wouldn't care about our height if it wasn't a factor in the dating world. I was always one of the shortest guys in my class in school, which was always annoying when we had to do class pictures and I was reminded that I fit in right with the females, but during my adult life up before the time I wanted to date I didn't think about my height **at all**. The whole height disadvantage thing really came out of left field. 

**""Just date girls shorter than you""** I wish it was that easy, but the standard request from girls is ""still a couple inches taller than me when I'm wearing high heels,"" which means the only &lt;5'2"" girls are feasible according to the high-heeled shoe request, but of course the shorter girls are the ones who usually are more stringent about a guy needing to be tall!

I think it's appropriate to call out women on the high heels obsession because *it's all about vanity and insecurity*. They want their legs to look longer and their butt to stick out more. They're concerned chiefly with how *they* will look next to him.

**""It's just a preference.""** That's a very open-ended statement. A preference can mean something like ""I prefer strawberry ice cream to vanilla ice cream"": I like them both, but I just like one a little more. I wouldn't turn down vanilla ice cream. Of course male height isn't like this. Short is **unattractive**, and I've accepted this. A girl preferring tall guys to short guys is more like preferring vanilla ice cream to liver-flavored ice cream; I'd rather have no ice cream at all than some gross-tasting kind. That's how much shortness sucks in terms of attracting the opposite sex.

Oh, I almost forgot ....... trying to explain to women that ""It's just a preference"" is not an encouraging statement inevitably turns into women telling you that you don't believe women should be allowed to have preferences or that you're an entitled neckbeard who thinks he deserves attractive women.

**""Tom Cruise is short.""""** Camerawork + $$$$$$$$$$$$$. I don't need to expound on this one. 

**""It's not your shortness that's unattractive to women; it's your lack of confidence, your attitude, your insecurity.""** I think a lack of confidence is well-deserved if you've been rejected explicitly because of your height and if you've eavesdropped on females discussing height. Also, a short guy has a very fine line to tread in terms of attitude. If he's too passive and reserved, then he's viewed as feminine, unmanly; if he's confident and boisterous, then he's viewed as compensating and suffering from Short Man Syndrome. In fact, if he ever tries hard in anything in life, he's viewed as compensating.

In fact, arguably a lot of the best players in the game are of lesser height. An impossibility with Basketball, NFL, Rugby...The greatest player to have ever played - Lionel Messi - is only 169cm. Football suits the short man. That low center of gravity proves to be a great advantage when in possession. The most exciting dribblers with their deft touches and sublime passing - or in footballing terms, the players with a lot of flair - are usually members of the 'Short Man Crew'. Anyhow, I don't wanna focus too much on the technicalities of the game and bore you. 

My main focus: The Spanish attacking midfielder, who plays in London for Chelsea football club. Standing at 174cm. Humble, witty, supremely talented, and extremely nice. Mata is currently working on completing a second degree as well as bossing it on the pitch for club and country. Despite his tremendous success, he is a very down to earth individual. Always taking the time to sign autographs and pose for photos with fans. His grasp of the English language is also mightily impressive and he's remarkably articulate in interviews. 

This guy is a short man's role model without a shadow of a doubt. In fact, forget mere football for a moment, his personality transcends the whole game. He's gained a lot of respect since coming to England, even from bitter rivals (quite a unique feat). Yet no sperm bank would accept him in the USA? I raise my glass to an extraordinary individual! 

For those at all interested; see what he can do with his feet!

Some of you, most likely, come from athletic backgrounds. If you do, you'll know that there's a certain energy during sports events that isn't present elsewhere. Sports events are where people are free to let loose any frustration they hold during their daily lives. They aren't daycare centers where everyone must be polite to each other.

I think this subreddit is becoming so over-protective and PC regarding height, and it's becoming so very ridiculous. I've been lurking here for a long time, and only recently started posting. I think the people here are fostering an inaccurate representation of the real world, wherein everyone is a nice, polite person.

People are assholes. Sure, one could go so far as to say the man featured in the aforementioned thread is an asshole. However, that **in no way** provides you with the grounds to attempt to ruin his business and his livelihood by trolling reviews of his restaurant. There's a difference between saying a stupid remark at a youth hockey match, and attempting to ruin someone's business that, as most of you wouldn't know, he most likely invested his life into.

What I'm trying to get across with this thread is that the people in this subreddit need to stop being **hypersensitive** and realize that no matter how much you point it out, heightism will **never go away**. Why isn't this something that you people can realize? You compare it to racism, and I'd love to point you to, again, the real world, where racism is as prevalent as ever.

Again, the man's actions in the video can be seen as immature, but there are thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of people *just like him*. The people that subscribe to this subreddit want to believe that they can rid the world of heightism, but ultimately, you're just showing yourselves to be **hypersensitive** and **naïve**.

Also, I don't want the ""height card"" pulled on me, because I'm a whopping 5'7"" myself. Can we please discuss how to change ourselves to deal with heightism instead of trying to change the basic human nature of judging others by their physical appearance? The sooner we realize that heightism is not going away, the sooner we can begin to toughen up and stop being so oversensitive.

She was cute so I decided to talk to her and we got along during the night. Now at one point she and the other girls got into a conversation about how tall someone would have to be in order to be with them and they all agreed they had to be at least 5'6 so they could wear their shitty high heals that they probably all look like a new born giraffe walking in. After I heard all of that I felt pretty discouraged but as the night went on she continued to show interest in me even though she kept pointing out how short I was aloud. No one cared or even paid any mind to her because I was with all really good friends who obviously couldn't care less how tall I was. She was a new face at the party, a friend of a friend. I'm probably around 5'4, 5'5 and  while I am on the shorter end, I was taller than her since she was only 5' herself. Well we wound up hooking up that night. A couple days later she texts me about going to 6 flags and I was like ehhh I'm not a big fan (unbeknownst to her I get severe motion sickness) and she responds with ""why is it because you're too short for the rides?"" Yet she still texts me constantly to hang out and is obviously interested in me even though it seems like my height somehow comes into play at any chance she gets. For me it was just a one off thing that night and I told her I don't have time for anything since I work full time and she's going off to school in a couple weeks.

There are thousands if not tens of thousands of sites which sell ""Growth"" formulas (for height, get your mind out of the gutter) in the form of pills, methods, and even machines which promise to stretch you a couple of inches. Then there is the subset of this, lifts, insoles, shoes with lifts built in and etc.

There was this huge controversy over some research that Brazillian doctors were working on a substance called [""CNP""] (http://www.naturalheightgrowth.com/2013/07/29/bmn-111-a-cnp-analogue-promotes-skeletal-growth-treating-children-suffering-from-achondroplasia/) that was supposed to help dwarves grow taller in the form of a pill. Men went crazy over this and some [Turkish doctor promised individuals that he came up with a compound](http://grow-tall-forum.proboards.com/index.cgi?action=recent) which would do the same for short males. He charged individuals $200 for a ""starter pill"" and then $500/mo for the ""formula"" all under the guise of a trial. Turns out he pocketed thousands of dollars from tens (maybe hundreds?) of unsuspecting (read: stupid) people who of course were just left with empty pockets. If I'm not mistaken, the trial was supposed to go on for a year. Can you imagine that? $200 to start, plus $500/mo for 12 months, from tens maybe hundreds of people?

My girlfriend is 3 inches taller than me and that difference didn't matter to me and it didn't seem to matter to her. She would defend it and tell people that height didn't matter. Some people still commented about how it was weird and didn't look right. My friends joke that I'm dating an ""Amazonian"" 5'6"" girl.


One of my good friends had asked me about my shoe size a few weeks ago and I told her and asked why. She said she was ""just wondering"". Last week she surprised me with a two month late Christmas present: shoes with 2.5 inch lifts. I was offended at first but the next day I was curious so I tried them out. They were kind of uncomfortable but I decided to try them out. I eventually got used to them and have been wearing them for about a week.


Being just 2.5 inches taller has made me more confident and I feel that it kind of goes against my views that a persons height shouldn't matter. Nobody has commented about my shoes except for my annoying younger brothers. My friends and girlfriend haven't said anything about it but it feels so much better to be a closer height to her and to be taller than some girls because in general I'm not taller than anyone. Either my friends don't want to say anything about it or they just don't give a damn.

TL;DR - I've started wearing shoes with lifts and they make me feel more confident but also that I'm ""cheating"" (tough to explain).

Have any other guys worn lifts? Is it wrong for me to wear them?

Mum instead comes over to me with a much more expensive suit that has a much shorter cut, I try it on, fits fine. After we get it she says ""see, the regular fits *fine*"" even though this is literally almost as short-cut as Thom Browne suits with a price tag to match. No words.

I think she's in denial because she raised my sister and I on a strict vegetarian diet, which is fine, but there weren't even any *attempts* to get some more protein into mine or my sister's diets.

Important to note that I was a *very* late bloomer, as in I was 18 and barely had pubes.

When I did turn 18 I started eating meat without my parents knowing, good meat, not just fast food burgers and shit (although 18 years of vegetarianism and then a burger is indescribably orgasmic), it just so happens that I really started to put on a growth spurt at this point and shot all the way up to the glorious height of 5'6"" in a couple of years, almost 5'7"" now but that's definitely me done growing. Big fucking coincidence. I'm almost convinced my body was just waiting for the right stuff to start coming along before it did anything.

My mum is 5'7"" and my dad was 6'2"". Grandparents were all pretty tall, both my cousins are tall, the 14 year old girl is 5'4"" already.

How do you guys brush them off or interpret peoples' comments?  How do you call someone out for being a rude asshole without making things awkward?

  I have not yet reached the point of self acceptance or confidence in my life where petty comments don't bother me.  I find that even a single rude comment by a stranger or acquaintance will ruin my day. (making fun of my height gets old with close friends so I tend to not get as many comments that bother me) I know I shouldn't gauge my self-worth on others opinions of my physical appearance, but it affects me deeply.

In HS it was mildly annoying, but now as a 24 year old in the workplace, I find that my confidence is at its lowest and comments really get to me.  I always equate making a mean spirited comment about one's height as telling someone who is overweight and self conscious of it, that they are fat.  My friends tell me that I'm easily offended and I just need to get over it, but I'm not sure how to be in the frame of mind where comments don't have an effect on me.

I have a colleague in particular who never misses a chance to make remarks about my height.  She says things like, ""you're like the size of a 5th grader"" or ""its so funny that you can't see over the cubicle wall"".  When I received a compliment on my outfit, she felt the need to interject and ask if ""I got it from the kids section"".  I find that her comments are more hostile than people who will just objectively mention my height like one would describe hair color for instance.  I have no choice but to lightheartedly jab fun at myself and laugh it off, even though I would rather take the low road and call her out on how I don't appreciate her remarks (making everyone uncomfortable) or hurling insults back about her physical appearance (being overweight and having really problematic skin).  I am not sure whether she's just fishing for laughs from others, if these comments come from her own insecurities, or she truly doesn't mean anything by it.

Tuck in your goddamn shirt. Most men in Western countries do not do this outside work. Furthermore, most standard shirts are too long on us short guys. I was always concerned about looking too formal or nerdy or whatever, but I started tucking in my shirts in social settings and noticed I looked and felt taller. It creates a slimming effect.

Fit &gt; style. Fancy clothes look like crap if they don't fit. Yes I know shopping sucks for us. However, don't cheap out on tailoring.

As a short female, I thought I'd like to provide you with my personal list of top 5 things that are great about being short / not being tall. In no particular order: 

1. For men, you have no unreasonable penis-expectations to measure up to. If you're large, your partner will be pleasantly surprised. If you're not large, your penis will still appear bigger. 

2. For women, you can fit snugly into your partners' arms and be all feminine and cuddly and all that shit.  Plus, he can carry you easily. 

3. People are less intimidated by you. If some tall guy says something rude, he's a goddamn asshole, whereas if you say something rude, it's more forgivable. 

4. You live longer and suffer fewer health problems. http://deathisobsolete.com/short-people-live-longer/ and http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1071721/

There are kids a grade or two below him that are taller than he is.  He is about 46"" tall.

We've had him evaluated a couple of times by a pediatric endocrinologist, and the diagnosis so far seems to be that ""he's just small"" (she had a better way of phrasing it, but that was the gist of it).  She didn't feel that he would benefit from any sort of hormone therapy.  He does definitely show year-over-year weight and height gain, so he is still growing, just far below the curve.  She projected that his adult height would be 5' 4"" or so.  She also thought it was likely that he would hit puberty later than his peers (not sure if I should be happy or sad about that)

He seems huge to me when I pick him up, and compared to his siblings (5 years younger) but when I see him with peers it is obvious that he's much shorter.  For reference I'm 5' 10"" and his mom is about 5' 4"" - fairly average.

It doesn't seem to bother him much.  I think he's aware of it, and his best friend is a year younger and about 4 inches taller, but I don't think it's caused a huge problem at school with being teased.  Yet.

But I'm sure this will change as he gets older, and the other kids get meaner.  I am definitely not looking forward to junior high (6th grade, 2 years away).

Any advice, suggestions, words of encouragement, etc?  Was there anything in particular that helped you deal with this as a child? Anything you wish your parents had done (or not done) differently?  Were the other kids complete jackasses, or was it not a big deal to them?  Beyond social issues, are there any practical issues that will crop up that we'll be surprised by?

I just found this subreddit yesterday and I thought I'll introduce myself (I saw several new members introduce themselves in the past few days, so I wanted to do it myself too because it seems like a great community).

* I'm 26 years old, male, from a El Salvador (Central America). Right now I'm on my 8th and last year of medical school (called ""the social year"").

* My height is 155 cm (5'1''?), I'm the smallest male in my family, my dad is 5'11'', brother is 5'8'' or 5'9''. But my mother and sisters are all of them 5'0'', so I guess I got her height. 

* In my country I think the average height is around 5'6'' I think (we don't have any statistics about it) so even around here I'm considered short, I have always been the shortest male in all the classes I've taken (school and Med school), my time in high school was very hard for me but mainly it was because I felt bad for being this short (I stopped growing when I was 14, hardest thing in my life has been being told that I was done growing, that's something awful to tell a 14 y.o). It took me sometime to accept my height as nothing else but a number, but I finally did it around the time when I started med school (It also worked for me that in that time I lost like 30 lbs). But after that I started *poco a poco* (I don't know how to say it in english) to start telling people that I didn't like people telling jokes or playing jokes on me because of my height (Like people grabbing my pen and just stretching their arms up in the air, I would tell them to fuck off and tell them to grow up). 

* As far as the dating scene goes, I've only had 1 girlfriend (she was 5'1'' too), I've been single for 3 years or so but I think that the reason for that is not my height (I have some confidence issues which are more related to my weight not my height, since I'm telling almost all of my life here I'll say I used to weigh 189 lbs 5 months ago, right now I'm on a weight-losing streak which has me down to 163 lbs and healthier than ever). But let me just tell, for the record, that I definitely like short girls (2 inches up or down my height). 

* I haven't encountered much heightism in my country, but I'll be moving to the US next year to try and pursue my medical specialty up there, I'm hoping  I will not encounter any disadvantage there because of my height.

* As a bonus, I'd like to point out some advantages of being short (which are according to me, take it with a grain of salt): 1. No need to duck when walking, I've seen many taller friends hit their heads while being inattentive while walking. 2. Don't reach the top shelf in stores? That's why they have employees. We can reach the down shelves easily, whereas taller people have to kneel down (which I've seen can be a pain in the ass for them). 3. People don't expect us to be strong, so we can impress them by showing our real strength and they will respect you even more once you do this. 4. Cars, there's no much limitation for us (I drive the huge Chevy Spark now, my dad barely fits in it lol). 5. We tend to be more agile than people taller than us (I remember playing some BKB games on my university where I would steal the ball like 5 or 6 times a game against taller adversaries, yup I don't shy away from playing BKB, I'm not that good but I love playing it).

Sorry if this info has already been posted before :

My friends saw me drinking a Starbucks iced mocha drink and the annoying one decided to point out that coffee makes you short. That annoyed me. Maybe someone has gotten that annoying ""fact""

After doing 5 minutes of research, my sources [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_consumption) and [AskMen](http://ca.askmen.com/top_10/travel/top-10-tallest-countries_1.html) gave me almost the opposite conclusion.

These the countries with highest coffee consumption (followed by the amount/year):

**Finland** 12.0 kg

**Norway** 9.9 kg

Iceland 9.0 kg

**Denmark** 8.7 kg

**Netherlands** 8.4 kg

**Sweden** 8.2 kg



The the tallest countries in the world (followed by average height) are:

**Netherlands** - 6'

**Sweden** - 5'11.5""

**Denmark** - 5'11.1""

**Norway** - 5'10.7""

Estonia - 5'10.5'

**Finland** - 5'10.2

In conclusion. Five out of the six tallest countries are in the top six coffee consuming countries.


In general, Scandinavian countries consume the most coffee and have the tallest people.

TL;DR: It annoys me when people related coffee with short height. If anything, it could be the other way around.

1.  Don't tell your kids that they should eat their vegetables so that they can grow up nice and *tall*.  In fact, don't make *tall* the goal at all.  This just enforces from and early age that height = right, and lack of it by comparison is a bad thing.  Also, it's a double whammy because it perpetuates the myth that diet makes a difference in your height in 1st world countries, and that short individuals were ""bad"" eaters.  

2.  Don't keep a marking of your kid's height on the door frame in the kitchen or wherever.  This isn't as obvious as point #1, but an open ended measurement only reinforces the idea that a taller measurement = better, and that if they aren't moving up that's a bad thing.  Especially don't do this if you have taller male siblings lined up next to shorter ones, because it just creates expectation.  In fact I would just leave all height measurement up to the doctors.  

3.  Pretty obvious, but don't tell your kids things like ""when you grow up, you'll be tall like ______"".  Not all sons are going to be as tall as their fathers and this causes psychological trauma to those that aren't when they are told this all their life.  Also, like point #1 it reinforces that being ""tall"" is something in itself that should be aspired to, instead of intelligence or skill.

4.  NEVER USE THE PHRASE ""you just haven't finished your growth spurt(s) yet"".  Especially past the age 16 or so.  You may not mean it, but the implied message is that their current height, which might just ultimately be their final height, somehow represents an unfinished stage of development, and that they are incomplete.  Not all kids go through growth spurts, or even one, and this is devastating to keep hearing this when you haven't grown for years and people still think you shouldn't be done.


5.  After a certain age, DO NOT buy clothes or shoes a size or two larger for your kids with the justification that you expect them to grow into it.  From my observations this seems to apply more to mothers and their sons, because you would never see someone buy a bigger size for a daughter, given the implications about weight and everything.  But too often you see some mom who just won't accept her son's short stature and manifesting this delusion by buying clothes that are consistently too large, as if, if they do, their son will grow into it.  This obviously can be very psychologically devastating having a parent buy these things that just lie around because you'll never fit them, a very tangible reminder that you aren't ""tall"" enough for their expectations.


6.  Don't use expressions like ""that was a petty little thing you did"" or ""don't be short with me"".  Obviously.

7.  Mothers, this last one is for you:  Stop shaming your daughters when they bring home short guys!  We unfortunately live in a society that even the most self described liberal and progressive mothers, one who would never show racist tendencies or condemnation against gays, still exhibit loud and visceral negative reactions at the prospect of their daughters dating a short man.  So much so that beyond belittling the man to their daughter in private, they'll do it right in front of him!  My theory is that subconsciously, they realize that if their daughter marries and procreates with a short man, they might have, *gasp*, short male grandchildren.  And since they realize how badly they get treated in society, even if they won't acknowledge it out loud, they try to shame their daughters into avoiding that fate.  

8.  No disney.  Nothing pushes the ""every girl deserves a tall, dark and handsome prince"" meme like Disney.  Or perpetuates that short individuals are creepy villains (witches, bad guys) and that the protagonist is a tall, strapping figure.

I'll be 2-2.5 inches taller, which is still short but just crosses the *very short* border where I live.
Maybe not as many people will treat me like this then.

I think to myself that I will support short people who get bullied since I won't be as vulnerable.

I have this friend who used to get bullied a lot for being short (I had no role). Then came his late growth spurt.
He is much taller than I and I see that he *really* enjoys his height. He brings up the topic of height every now and then, asks people how tall they are, and even makes fun of short people. He is probably living his dream(?)

I never thought that there was a huge problem with heightism and women until I stumbled upon it on the internet. I am about 5'6, decent looking and throughout my entire life I have never had this issue that I have seen a lot of males complain about how most women want a guy who is very tall. 

A bit of back story of my life is that I went to public grade schools which for the most part consisted of mostly African American and Latin American students. The majority of the students from middle school to high school were either about my height or taller (roughly 5'11ish would be the average for males in Hhgh school iirc). When it came to dating women, I have seen all types situations living in NYC. I have seen men who were 5'2 in some of my classes who had girlfriends who were pretty good looking. I have seen guys 5'10 date a female who was 6'0. I myself usual date women around my height (5'4 -5'7). Neither me nor the guys I mentioned were rich, were on a sports team or were well endowed (well Im not) but it never stopped us from being able to get a female. Even when I go back to my native country (Dominican Republic), I have seen tons of guys all over the place who were pretty short date women around the same height or taller. By the way I am not a smoove or amazing looking guy (kind of skinny and wear oval-shaped rimless eyeglasses). 

My question is without bring on a race war in this thread, is the heightism problem more among white males/females? I know of African and Latin women who are completely superficial, who only date guys above 6'2 etc but more often than not, I have seen many more women of these ethnicity date/sleep/marry guys who weren't that tall. I am also not saying African/Latin males have never experienced heightism because it does happen to them too. I am asking if most the problems I see on the internet come from white males/females?

Personally, I find this line of reasoning, which is quite common on reddit and the real world, very, very offensive as it implies that short stature is an inherently inferior trait to tall stature, and it reminds me of the same racist social darwinist propaganda used to disenfranchise blacks a century ago.  It's used as some kind of sick justification without people even realizing the implications sometimes, etc, *""I can't help that I don't like short guys, it's the caveman part of my brain looking for a protector""* instead of realizing they have been brainwashed by social conditioning all their lives.

Moreover, on a scientific level it doesn't make sense.  If shortness were a trait actually being selected against, then men would be as repulsed by it as much as women are when it comes to mate selection, when that is not the case at all.  As it isn't the case, ""shortness"" isn't going anywhere because there will be just as many tall women passing on their genes as their are short women.  In fact, since biologically men are physiologically 'designed' to have more offspring -- women can only get pregnant about once a year while men could impregnate multiple women in that time -- if shortness were being selected against, it *would* be men who had the distaste for it.


That is all speculation on my part.  I was wondering if there was perhaps someone more academically learned in the study of evolutionary biology who could succinctly explain the fallacy of this ""natural selection"" argument once and for all, preferably with examples and facts that could be used in the future in rebuttal against this offensive argument.",,False,self,t5_2sgvi,1371931994.0,,,True,t3_1gve01,http://www.reddit.com/r/short/comments/1gve01/the_natural_selection_argument_any_evolutionary/,

If anyone asked me my type I wouldn't have said short guys (I would have said smart guys) yet everyone I dated was my height or a little less, so interpret that as you will. I did seriously date one guy who was significantly taller than me but he was a jerk and kind of psychotic. I don't think his height had anything to do with his mental status...?

Of course my boyfriends' relative height could have something to do with the fact that I'm a 5'10"" chick. Plus my mom had me in ballet during my formative years and I do yoga now so I have excellent posture which stretches me to my fullest height. But mostly I truly am attracted to personality. I like a smart, ambitious, athletic guy; unfortunately I'm also attracted to an aggressive (read: jerk) type, which has led to relationships that have passionate beginnings and explosive ends. Anyway, it's not like I've been out looking for short guys, they were always the ones who came on to me, but it turns out that that's who I tend to date, for whatever reason. 

One LTR was with a man who was only just 0.5 inches shorter than me. Not even anything I'd think a person would notice. We went out, and then back to his place, then he walked me to the door so I could go home. I slipped off my heels to kiss him goodnight but he told me to put them back on because ""you make me feel like I'm dating America's top model."" Which was a super sweet compliment and made me feel great!

Anyway, we broke up because even though he could be charming when he felt like it, at heart he was a selfish prick. Good riddance. 

So on to me, single again. I meet future fiancé through friends and it just so happens to be a week before my birthday! He comes to my party, again with a group of friends and I had NO IDEA he was interested in me. But we went from a restaurant to a club and he bought a bottle for us, which my friend's alcoholic boyfriend consumed almost singlehandedly, total jerk move, but FF wasn't upset, he was really cool and just wanted everyone to have fun. That stuck in my head that he was a nice guy and a gentleman so I started admiring him, still not having a clue he liked me. (He says it was obvious that he was interested in me and I was oblivious for not noticing it, LOL.) Also I was wearing these towering heels that night that were like silver cages and looking at the pics of us in a group he came up to like my shoulder. Did I mention he's 5'7""?

Anyway we started dating and I started wearing the hell out of my one pair of ballet flats. This is our first night we spent together:

Me, putting my hand in his boxers for the first time, start giggling uncontrollably. 

FF (laughing too): What? Did something surprise you?

Me: Ummmm, yes...

FF: Did you think because I'm short that I'd have a small dick?

Me: Well...maybe yes?

FF: So you're surprised then?

Me: Yeah, but it's a good surprise!

Fast forward six months and I gave all but my two favorite pairs of heels away to my sister, who is taller than me and married to a guy even taller than her. &lt;sigh&gt; I still miss them, and the nice ones I took care of for years she scuffed up in no time. Such is life. I was serious about him from the start but I waited six months to make sure he was serious about me. 

Now I have ballet flats in every color, plus those new ""smoking slippers"" and I insisted on a pair of black leather boots with kitten heels. Those are like one inch heels. And not to be mean, because I love my sister, but all the tall shoes she wears to work and to go out have given her foot problems and her podiatrist wants her to wear sneakers now. 

I can't say we have any height-related issues at all. Except I like to do my hair in different ways, including sometimes big tall waves, and fiancé always wants me to have straight hair. I have a sneaking suspicion it's because the big hair makes me look even taller. But I could be wrong, either way when I feel like rolling my hair I'm going to do it. 

Occasionally someone from work or whatever will see a pic of us and comment on how it looks like it looks like he's a few inches shorter than I am. My answer's always the same:

Reading some of the front page articles has helped me check myself though. I wanted to say thanks and share some tidbits of my life where being short effects it:

* Is 28, looks 19. Not terrible but plenty of people don't want to take me seriously. A worse case is when someone 18 or younger is chatting me up because they're always shocked after hearing my age then either they don't care or they're a little offended that I would try to trick them by looking so young. Also attracting the younger age range isn't in my ideal.
* I've never feel short in my day to day life but the first time I realized it was affecting me was during my first job at a 3-screen movie theater. The register was higher up than usual, so there was a stool for people under 6' to use the register properly. Continually I would cash out girls who are clearly flirting with me but the second I walk down, the expression in their face was hard to witness. The shocking disappointment followed by trying to back out of little sweet things said moments before.
* I think we all know to forget online dating but if you do that, while being honest about your height, and they say something along the lines of ""I thought you would be taller"" a reply that tends to work for me is ""We all did."" I think I read 5'8"" in pictures so they have this version of me I can't live up to already.
* Shortest girl I dated was 4'10""; tallest was 5'10""
* Born and lived around San Francisco, think that helped me be more comfortable with my height as traditional masculinity is less valued there.
* On my dad's side, they are very conservative, smaller area folk and machismo is a huge social factor for them and I felt like the women in that community were harsher towards/offended by me due to height.
* I'm habitually single which I think is more to do with my inability to express emotions well but I know I've heard plenty of people say to me or within my earshot that ""if only I were taller."" I think it's because I have a lot to offer everywhere else: hard-working, talented, interesting, and physically attractive. I feel like I end up being a lot of female's sex buddies while they're in between ""real"" relationships. That's not terrible at first but it's tough when you get genuine feelings for someone over weeks and months of sleeping with them, and they always back off. I know a lot of you say ""well if they care, then they're not worth it"" but I'm sure there are a lot of great people with that weird ideal, hell, maybe I express that same ideal in a different way I'm unaware of. 
* I'm for the abolishment of the gender in general. It may have served an ancient purpose but modern conventions make all of that irrelevant. But we do this because we don't want to reevaluate a lot of these traditional social standards, which affect a lot more than what short guys have to deal with, but I do believe we are part of that energy lost from an inefficient, ancient machine. We can do better than this.

So yeah, I might be a bit much but I promise I'm pretty normal in person. Just stressed out lately now that I'm about to graduate. I'm excited but I thought me graduating with honors/deans list/etc would help me socially but being more responsible and less outrageous definitely doesn't bring in romance. I also suspect it's where I live because I went to tennessee for 3 months once and I got hit on all over the place by people I considered especially attractive. I don't think anyone has ever come up to me in the 3 years I've lived in New Mexico. I'm about to move on after graduation but it's really tough not having family or an SO to celebrate with you, help you emotionally through the tough times, to challenge you, to grow with you.

/r/tall and /r/short are communities. Just like fishing or skiing or dancing or medical condition or religious related (I'm just coming up with random things) subreddits are communities based on those things.

They can post positive, negative, serious, humorous things related to their community and it's fine because they're not comparing themselves to another subreddit.
Comparing one to the other isn't always a good idea. 


The fact that we're comparing /r/short to /r/tall is a bad idea. The tall communities has many things to benefit from and positively joke about. The short community not as much. /r/tall also has about 7 times more users than /r/short therefore it makes sense that they have more posts.


Tall people can speak about their heights whenever and wherever they want and it's *usually* fine. Short people *usually* cannot express their negative feelings about their heights anywhere but on the internet and /r/short is a community where they can share it with other short people.

The main tall issues seem to be planes, mirrors, showers, and clothes (XXL clothes is easier to find than XXS). Short issues are so negative because they tend to be more negative issues.


There are many posts about heightism on /r/short. Heightism is basically discrimination of people based on their heights. Not just short. Racism is discrimination of people based on their race. Not just one specific race. However people of tall heights are not subjected to heightism as much as short people. Just like white people are not subjected to racism as black people.

Therefore /r/tall has many more positive things to post about than /r/short. There is common ground but the fact that some people want them to be identical is impossible. 


The top posts on both subreddits are all pictures of funny things regarding the size of objects or with SOs so we are similar in that way.

TL;DR: Subreddits are communities in which they post things related to their communities.

http://www.reddit.com/r/tall/comments/15asm3/rant_against_napoleon_complex_short_guys/ http://forum.bodybuilding.com/showth...0546443&amp;page=4

After reading these threads and seeing how people make rude comments about short and average height people, I realized that these days average height isn't tall enough either. How does this make me feel considering I'm short? Women's standards are much higher than men's standards so men have to keep up. It's common knowledge that 20% of the guys monopolize the dating market. Most of these guys happen to be tall as well. If a guy is short, but good looking and has an aesthetic body, he still isn't considered because his height disqualifies him instantly due to the fact that most women have a height requirement of at least 5'10. Frequently, women have a height cutoff of 6ft regardless of their height. So this establishes that short guys are at a huge disadvantage with women. Not only are short guys at a huge disadvantage with women, they are also at a huge disadvantage in terms of getting respect from their peers. Short guys are mocked by men and women, and aren't taken seriously in the workplace. If a short guy tries to be assertive and wants to be successful, he's labeled as having a napoleon complex. Tall people love to make fun of short people and physically bully and intimidate them. Why do I have to live an unfulfilling life when I can live a happy life as an average height guy without all of the stigma and bull**** that comes with being short? Leg lengthening surgery is a difficult thing but according to this it's possible to fully recovery from it: 

""I started out at 173.5cm, and after my procedure I stood at 180cm. 4.5cm came from actual lengthening, the rest came from the correction of my bowed legs which is pure luck as that it ENTIRELY impossible to predict.

For all those really lazy people who have invaded our community and refuse to read anything before asking questions, here's a summary:

•I had my operation on September 26 2006. •I lengthened for exactly two months. •I turned at 0.866mm per day. Every day. •I exercised at least an hour a day. Every day. •I ate like a king, hardly ever took a painkiller and always followed my doctors' advice. •I did my last turn at the end of November 2006. •I waited a month to ensure good consolidation. •I had my frames off on December 20 2006 (in time for Christmas!) •I had a superb time with a brilliant room-mate (mysteryman) and fantastic attention from the doctors and nurses. •I fully embraced the culture of my host-country, and was respectful to my environment •I went home to Britain on crutches at the end of January 2007. •I went back to Beijing for a check-up and correction in May 2007. •I had my rods removed in in May 2008 and left about 10 days later, walking normally, but sore for a few days.

I am now 100% normal, and 110% the man I was before - taller, straighter, stronger and more confident. Ready to conquer the world!

I can run, jump, spin, dance, make love, and body-pop just as well as before. In fact, I think that I am in some respects better because I have straighter legs with slightly bigger muscles than before - and I will be putting that to the test by doing a parachute jump for charity earlier next year, partly to celebrate my success.

My experience in New York confirmed in my mind that I am now 100% recovered from my procedure. I promised myself that I wouldn't write about this unless I really did feel 100% recovered.

My operation was almost exactly two years ago, and it is now a distant memory.

All that I know, every time I am walking down the street, is that I am taller and (even) more elegant than before. 

The world is considerably different at 180cm (5'11"") from what is was at 173.5cm (5'8""); the world is considerably better.""

So what do you guys think? Is it worth it? I would love to go from 5'7 to 5'10 so I'll never have to deal with heightism, taunts and rejections based on height again in my life.

I was thinking about blogging about my thoughts, but I want to get the opinions of other people first.  

One r/short member pointed out that very few short men have openly professed their love of short women in the way that tall men openly profess their love for tall women over at r/tall.  I think that is probably true.  But, after thinking about it, I realized that r/tall seems to be much more ""flirty"" than r/short.  Tall guys (at least over there) seem much more likely to express their desires when it comes to women - and with great specificity.

So my question to r/short is - why is that?

I have my own theory.  I suspect that we short guys are socialized to repress our feelings when it comes to women.  This is especially the case in public places.  That is, short men are social discouraged, overtly and implicitly, from openly flirting in public and that crosses over into online behavior.  

I have personally experienced times in social gatherings where I felt like my participation was limited as ""the short guy"" in order to maintain a group cohesion or perhaps to spare the dignity of females who may have to associate with a short man in a public setting (the implication being that [standing next to a short man is humiliating](http://www.shortsupport.org/TheMedia/commercials/yoplait.mov)).  

**Other ways short guys may be discouraged from flirting with women in public:**

**""You looking at my girl, bro?""** -
This is the scenario of some guy trying to prove his masculinity by attacking a shorter (but always also smaller) guy.  Notice that this doesn't happen when the short guy has muscles and the other guy thinks he may not be able to win a fight.  

**The head fake, then look away** -
This is when girl sneaks a peak at you, notices you're short, and looks away.

**The overt comment** -
""Forget about it dude, she's probably like 2cm taller than you in heels""

**The nasty look** -
ewww, a short guy

**The wedding party scenario** - This is basically any boy/girl outing in which arrangements are made to try to find a very short girl to go out so ""the short guy will have someone to talk to"" - the short girl never appreciates being used in this way and so she is especially mean to the short dude during the outing.

**shortness not viewed as an asset** -
Maybe it's just that tall guys talk about their height as a way to flirt, but short men can't do that because our height is seen as a negative?

**""Is this guy bothering you?""** - 
This is the scenario where a taller guy swoops in to the conversation while you're talking to a woman because he thinks/realizes that it would be an easy pick-up.  

That's all I can think of right now...but there are probably others.

What are they? Shower heads, airplanes, and ceilings in asian countries.
It's proven that taller men get [paid more and promoted faster](http://thesocietypages.org/socimages/2012/07/03/are-americans-aware-of-heightism/) than shorter men. There's inexpensive shower heads made specifically for tall people. It's an extra $25-$75 dollars to upgrade to first class and have more leg room on a plane, plus you can afford it since you're getting paid more than the shorter people. Crouching under ceilings in an asian country isn't going to be the bane of your existence.

Would you guys rather be short and get paid less, be discriminated, have girls reject you based on something you have no control over, have every choice you make be judged on your height? If a short guy works hard to make money: he's making up for being short. If he has a nice car or a big truck: he's trying to make himself feel good. If he gets upset over anything (including being picked on for his height): he has a Napoleon Complex. People publicly comment about how short guys should [""eat ass"", ""why do they exist"", ""why do they think they can talk to me"", ""they creep me out"", ""don't matter"", ""disgusted by their sight"", ""aren't real men and should hate themselves every day for it"", ""shouldn't have egos"".](https://twitter.com/expsnghghtsm) Imagine if someone said that stuff about a race (like black people)!

Sure there are some cons to being tall but mostly pros but there are definitely not enough pros to make up for all of the cons of being a short guy.

Some example tweets that have been made:

""guys under 5'10"" should be executed""
""Whoever finds short men attractive is sick in the head.""
""I don't go for short guys even tho i'm short myself.""
""I hate short men period""

Now I understand that the ""short guys have a tough time dating"" thing has been done to death, especially on this subreddit.

Seeing this twitter feed opened my eyes to how painful it can be.

I don't know what the deal is, but the entire heightism twitter feed found only mention of hate against short guys (I couldn't find anything derogatory about short girls), maybe the owner of the feed didn't retweet heightist tweets against girls (although I doubt this is the case).

I know it seems like further complaining about a subject that is endlessly complained about. But I just can't get over the fact that despite these obviously hateful comments being made (not just stating a preference), every time this topic comes up we don't get much farther than telling the guys to get over it.

I consider myself strong and independent. I’m a scientist and engineer, so I spent a lot of time being in a male dominated field. I am proud of who I am and all that I’ve accomplished.Growing up, I was lucky enough to be raised with 3 older bothers and a father who really supported my love of science. I didn’t play with barbie dolls, I played with chemistry sets ith by brothers.
This is not what women traditionally get celebrated for. We see movies with Disney princesses, and expect our men to be tall, dark, and handsome. At the same time, in college especially, we were told that women could do anything. I still think this is true, and I try to prove this in my career all the time. 

I’ve always said that height is a gender issue. Women, if we’re always looking for men that make more money than us, are bigger than us/give us physical protection, and are better than us in every way, I don’t know how that helps our image in society. If we’re always asking to be looked down on in terms of dating, then women will constantly be looked down on in society. It drives me nuts. That’s why I date men who are my height, and it makes me feel extremely femine: able to do all the things men are able to do. It makes me feel strong. That is a modern definition of being a woman and frankly, holding on to all these old notions of male dominance really holds us women back. 
So, with that, I will say two things:

1)	For women: Younger women tend to be the ones that will have these extreme cutoffs. I did when I was younger. Why? Because in America, its really hard to get good female role models to tell us what we want .My mother never told me who I should marry because it meant that I didn’t have choice. So I looked to TV and movies. That told me I wanted tall, dark, handsome providers. My grandmother was a big influence for me. She told me to go for stability, a work ethic, and an ability to make me laugh.


2)	For men, just because a guy is tall does not mean he is automatically date worthy. Women still judge men by their ability to navigate the world, and this will be true no matter who you are. It’s why women say “man up”, because you will be surprised just how interesting a man can become when he is successful and confident in his abilities. 

TL;DR We all are judged, and things will hurt. I'm not a perfect model, so I have to work harder. Just like a man who is not perfectly tall has to work harder. Everyone that isn't the perfect supermodel has to work for something.

Dudes of r/short, I apologize ahead of time if the contents of this post piss you off. Feel free to avoid the comment section like it's your job and go about the rest of your day.

The urge to downvote everything in sight will be strong, and I can't stop you, but I do wish you'd lay off of downvoting something solely because you don't like it, because that makes threads a lot more difficult for me to read. But overall, this post is directed to the ladies.

Anyway, here goes:

I have a pretty massive preference for tall guys. Not tall*er*. Not even normal tall. But *talllllllll*. 

I don't think I was always this way...and, in fact, it's only recently that I've actually even noticed it. I'm not sure when this preference began to take hold; I'm not sure if it is due to a series of influences, or if my personal ""type"" is solidifying, or something else. 

My dating history kind of goes something like this: I never really thought about height very often growing up. A guy was either cute or not, and I don't recall factoring in his height in any substantial way. (When you're 14, you mostly care about whether or not his jeans are baggy enough and if his frosted bangs make him look like Justin Timberlake.)

My first boyfriend was 6'. I think that was pretty random. Then the next one was, coincidentally, also 6'. It was only after this that a pattern began emerging. I noticed it, my friends and family noticed it, and we'd all joke about how I had a total lady-boner for tall dudes. Still, though, it wasn't a HUGE huge deal, and I kind of saw it as on par with my affection for green eyes--I liked them, but it wasn't a deal maker or breaker. Obviously a lot of other things mattered more.

The next dude was 6'2"", which actually felt a little too tall at first. Then it happened: my last ex. **6'5""** in socks. He was actually sitting down when we first met, so we started chatting and connecting while I was completely oblivious to his stature. When he finally stood up, I was like, ""Wait...how tall are you?"", and then I was like, *""WHAT??!""* It seemed ridiculous. Nevertheless, we started dating, I fell in love, and then he proceeded to *ruin* short guys for me. RUIN THEM. Along with average guys. And even some tall guys, believe it or not. 

We were together for so long that 6'5"" started to feel normal. I got so used to the way he looked and how our bodies fit together that a 6' tall man seems completely average to me now. Also, I have to confess, I got a powerful thrill out of having him on my arm. His (devastating, imo) good looks and athletic build, on top of the fact that he was always the tallest person in the room, made him a magnet for attention. I genuinely loved parading around town with him.

Being on this sub has made me start to analyze my motivations and inner workings when it comes to this facet of sexual/romantic attraction. First off, unless I can shake this, my dating options will becoming exceedingly limited. I feel the need to try to dismantle this a little bit.

Secondly, I question what this may say about how I truly feel about gender roles. I've always liked to believe that I thought outside of the box with regards to male and female archetypes, but...I guess not as much as I previously thought?

I still have issues though.  Even at ~12% bodyfat and 126 pounds, I still can't stand how my body looks.

I am new to Reddit and to the r/short. It was recommended to me Geoff Arnold. 

I'm 4 11"", female from England.  Everyone in my family is pretty short.

My husband is about 5 2"" and I love him for it.

I run a small blog about heightism called, creatively, Stop Heightism.

I am looking forward to getting to know you all and to having some interesting discussions about heightism.

I would be grateful if someone could tell me how to create one of those little boxes next to my username that says how tall I am. I feel left out.

* look about 14 when clean shaven, thus i haven't clean shaved since first year of university 
* actually able to sport a strong beard, most of my male friends are jealous 
* got the 'short' end of the gene pool, both my parents are the same height as me, all of their siblings are taller, my sibling despite being 7yrs younger is taller.
* i tell people being short doesn't bother me but i still secretly hate the constant short jokes told at my expense every. damn. day
* in other aspects i actually like my height, and im still eligible for becoming an astronaut which is a dream that while a tad unrealistic, gives me a shred of hope

It's nice to see one for shorties. Being short has it's ups and downs. Here's the 2nd verse from the Tao Teh Ching the John C. H. Wu translation:
 When all the world recognizes beauty as beauty, 
 this in itself is ugliness. 
When all the world recognizes good as good, this in 
 itself is evil.

Indeed, the hidden and the manifest give birth 
 to each other. 
Difficult and easy complement each other. 
Long and short exhibit each other. 
High and low set measure to each other. 
Voice and sound harmonize each other. 
Back and front follow each other.

Therefore, the Sage manages his affairs without ado, 
And spreads his teaching without talking. 
He denies nothing to the teeming things. 
He rears them, but lays no claim to them. 
He does his work, but sets no store by it. 
He accomplishes his task, but does not dwell upon it.

And yet it is just because he does not dwell on it 
That nobody can ever take it away from him. 

This may be really out there for a lot of people but hopefully someone gets something out of it. If anything when it comes to being short society gives us a lot of bs but that doesn't mean we have to give ourselves bs for our height.

Whenever I did have a girl-related complaint I would always have someone tell me ""I know one guy who's short/ugly/fat and can get all of the girls"". That really annoyed me.

It seems like I'd been blinded and not wanting to believe that because I felt that I was confident and all of that stuff was bullshit that happened to one person and that it wouldn't apply to me.

I didn't realize something until one of my best friends pointed this out to me. He is an average height, overweight, filipino guy in Canada. Girls don't tend to like guys of his physique but they love him. He's 18 and he's had so many girlfriends since we were in 8th grade. He's hooked up with so many girls. It's not just girls who like him. It's everybody. My school doesn't have the whole ""clique"" thing but everyone loves him. He's friends with everyone, he meets someone new and within minutes he's laughing along with them. 


Recently, he's either sympathized more with me or got really tired of my complaining because last weekend he decided to show me ""the ways"". I know it's not all about ""getting the girls"" but we went to a party of a friend of a friends so he literally only knew one person and I didn't know a single one. I don't understand how he does it but he would start talking to a group of people and within five minutes they'd love him. We'd be laughing with him and all having so much fun. It was clear that he was definitely one of the centres of attention for most of the party. 

He told me to ""watch and learn"" but I have no idea how he does it. He tells me it's all about confidence. Halfway through the party I can't find him. I texted him and he didn't respond. Then I found him in another room with one of the hottest girls at the party. She was taller than him in the heels she was wearing and if you ask me, way out of league.


He tells me it comes naturally to him. I've seen some comments by guys saying that all it takes is confidence.

Do any /r/short users have this ""ability"" themselves and is there something you do to actually achieve this or does it come naturally?

**AND THE WINNERS ARE**


**/r/short Top Contributor of 2012**

is /u/GeoffreyArnold !!!

Congratulations. Some may agree with him or some may not, but the truth of the matter is that he is the most active reader of our small (pardon the pun) community. He won the contest by a mile, mostly because he was the only person nominated BUT he was nominated by 4 people nontheless. 


Now, our next winner.

**Top /r/short Post of 2012**

was made by /u/funkless_eck !!!

[Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/short/comments/z3jwm/how_it_feels_to_sleep_on_a_plane_or_train_whilst/) is the cute post in question. After all, we are on Reddit so it's no surprise that a top post would be a picture of a cat :p


And now, the final winner of our contest:

**Title of /r/short's very own Cutest Couple of 2012**

goes to /u/MarieKathyrn and her fiance. You guys do look very cute together and I congratulate you on your win! :)

Worthy of mention is /u/Entropy_Greene and his prom date. [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/short/comments/12vx0h/i_may_have_been_one_of_the_shortest_guys_at_prom/) is the post that came 2nd. Close race! :)

I've seen this in action with a woman at my job. She's 5' at best and women talk down to her and act more aggressive with her, often speaking to her like she is a child. Sometimes men talk to her that way also. The woman doesn't carry herself as such, but she's still on the receiving end (often) of that treatment.

Girls are hard enough to understand in High School as it is. I have read the forms, subreddits, books, articles and any other resource on social dynamics, dating, and seduction to improve my personality and make myself a more likable person. I work out constantly, doing triathlons, weight training, and wrestling. I have developed a good sense of style that is noticed by my peers. Despite all these improvements I have made, the one thing that I cannot change, my height, continues to hold me back. To the tall people saying that height is not as big an issue as we say it is you have no idea. Height shapes our lives, in order to be respected as a person we must become exceptional people and feel an immense social pressure to do so for fear of becoming a lonley outcast. This is something that follows us from birth until death and I know, as a High School senior that this is something that I will live with, and battle against for the rest of my life. To all the older short people reading this, how have you dealt with it? How have you lived fulfilling lives with something that so many people, Men and Women, view as such a large deal breaker?",,False,self,t5_2sgvi,False,,blue,True,t3_1ib3aq,http://www.reddit.com/r/short/comments/1ib3aq/how_do_you_deal_with_it/,

I was always the smallest kid in my class in school, usually kids 2-3 grades behind me would be physically larger than me. Even in grade 12 I was still only 5'3, I didn't put on the last few inches until I was closer to 19.  
  
Being short was not my only curse, I was also unattractive in general. Pudgy, bad haircut, glasses that hid my face, and to top it all off I had the ""perpetual victim"" syndrome: because I expected people to treat me like shit, I got treated like shit. As you can probably imagine, I had no experience with girls at all.  
  
There was one guy who had been my friend all through high school, he was my complete opposite. Tall, athletic, popular, lots of girlfriends. We hung out a lot after graduating and eventually he talked me into going to the gym with him. I started working out, having no idea what I was doing and making every mistake possible. At the same time I started getting into Brazillian Jiu Jitsu after seeing the Gracie In Action videos. I loved how ground fighting equalizes size, even though the guys I was sparring against were taller and had longer reach than me I could submit them on the ground.  
  
The pudgy body was replaced by some muscles. I cut my hair really short so no-one could grab it during sparring, and it turned out to look a lot better than my 90s grunge theme. One night I went to a bar with my friend and his girlfriend, she reached over and took my glasses off. ""You know, you have really nice eyes. Why do you hide them?"" The next day I got contact lenses.  
  
I stopped thinking of myself as a victim and people stopped treating me like one. I started talking to girls, which was painfully awkward at first because I had missed out on all the relationship forming lessons most people pick up in school. After a few false starts I found myself with an actual girlfriend. Unfortunately I went too far in the other direction, got a big head and acted like a douchebag for a few years. Eventually I came to my senses and started acting human again, stopped treating women like disposable playthings, and met the love of my life who is now my wife of  7 years. She is everything good in the world and a 100% knockout as well, the kind of girl my high school self would never have dreamed I could ever be with.  
  
  
I guess the point of my story is this: don't let your physical dimensions define you as a person. I am short, and I used to think it made me less of a man. I've been [swole](http://www.reddit.com/r/swoleacceptance), and I thought it made me better than everyone else. Both lines of thought are complete bullshit.

I know how tough it is for you guys, from the 'how's the weather down there?' to the instant dismissal from girls. I don't know how to make it better. It's an obstacle, it really is. The only advice I can give is choose your friends wisely, they can make or break your self-image. This might be something you've not thought of. Don't hang around people who are 'play-aggressive' or if there's even a subtle patriarchal dynamic in the group, it's not compatible. Hang with people who would never use your size against you, even just jokingly. Don't befriend people who need to be the alpha male, the jibes and joking insults cut you deep, and they know you can't just work out and grow taller, you can't change your diet and grow taller, you can't spray tan it away, you can't hair dye it away, it's just something you can't change.

I occasionally shop in the petites section as well (f you REALLY dig in there and look, you'll see that they have some pretty damn nice stuff).  
-I wear a shoe size 6.5. I used to be a 7, but my feet have either shrunk or I'd been wearing the wrong size throughout high school. I like having this shoe size because the small size racks at department stores are rarely raided during big sales. :) And I can still buy kids shoes!  
-My hand is 6 1/4 inches long. I don't think they're very small since they're the exact same size as my 5'5"" sister's hands. We both buy gloves from the kids section. :)  
-Obviously, I can't answer this one... but come on, guys. Some of you are the proud owners of impressive packages!

* [Shoe size conversion chart](http://dkinstore.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/men-to-woman-shoe-size-conversion.gif) to convert from mens to womens, US to UK, etc.  
* 1in = 2.54cm OR [just use this calculator](http://www.manuelsweb.com/in_cm.htm).

/u/silentsamamander recently brought up a good idea to me (it can be found in [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/short/comments/16mbzr/second_discussion_general_rules/c7xep2t) comment). 

The idea is simple. If you're depressed and in need of someone to talk to then you can message some people from this list and we will do our best to help you out. 

The odds are, we are not qualified and this was one of my concerns, however I realized that some people just need someone to listen to them so this seems like the right thing to do. 


If you need someone to talk to then you can message users below:

/u/Azhdarkho

/u/ShabbySheik

/u/SabrinaLily

/u/SilentSamamander

/u/caboose_moose

/u/gensokyou9

If you would like to be a part of this list then just post a comment here and I'll add your name.

There are obvious potential downsides for both men and women here, both in their personal lives and professional lives. However, as it is discussed in the documentary I just posted, the biggest downside of being a short man usually arises in dating and sex life. If men are perceived to be less mature or imposing than their taller counterparts this often leads to the assumption that they are less manly, and less sexy. I have no problem finding short girls sexy and so do the vast majority of men as well, and there is a significant fraction of men that prefer petite women. For these reasons I believe that short men have it worse than short women, strictly in terms of height discrimination. 

However I can see how short women could face their own unique challenges. I could believe that some men are more predatory towards short women, and may be more interested in sex than taking her seriously. Many cultures still have problems taking women seriously so I could see how being short would compound those problems... I would be interested to see what a woman's perspective is on this, as my own is definitely male biased.

One of /r/short's mods, [Azhdarkho](http://www.reddit.com/r/short/comments/w8icd/women_of_rshort_why_do_some_shorter_women_insist/c5b9yjv), asked me to post a thread about heightism in order to open up a dialog about this taboo subject of which we are all aware, but of which most of us rarely think about or discuss.  For those of you who have no idea who I am, my name is Geoff and I run a blog on this subject called [The Social Complex](http://thesocialcomplex.tumblr.com/). 

So generally, heightism refers to discrimination or prejudice based on a person’s stature, especially discrimination against short people.  But while this definition tells us what the word means, it lacks precision because it doesn’t tell us anything about how the prejudice works.  Therefore, I have formulated what I believe to be a more descriptive definition of the word.  **Heightism is a gender based socially constructed prejudice which holds that human height should convey social privilege or stigma as enforced systemically through cultural “norms”, media impressions, familial dynamics, etc.**  This definition emphasizes the fact that heightism is an accepted element of our culture; a systemic social prejudice which is not merely limited to the thoughts or actions of a few bad actors.   

To read the rest of my thoughts on heightism, height generally, height stigma against tall men, workplace discrimination, and dating; [check out my interview](http://thesocialcomplex.tumblr.com/post/20617058641/interview) with a tumblr blog called ""Exploring the Underground"".

**I apologize in advance for the wall of text but I hope you will stick with it.**

I have always been short. I was the shortest kid in my year in elementary school and then one of the shortest going forward. But here is the thing; I never really gave it much thought. As I hit my late teens and early twenties and really started dating I was very lucky to be above average in the looks department, kept in great shape, had a well developed sense of style, a quick sense of humor, a strong work ethic, great active listening skills, and the ability to put people at ease when I interacted with them. I had lots of friends both male and female. I regularly received unsolicited statements from many of my female friends in the vein of “if they weren’t married by 30 that they were coming to steal me away whether I liked it or not”. Certainly not an environment that makes a guy worry about his height. 

As my twenties progressed I had very few problems dating attractive women. One was a dance major from Chicago (2 years), another a gorgeous dark haired bartender that looked like a better looking version of Carrie Anne Moss (2 years), and a redheaded librarian that was crazy in the sack. Yes, I bagged a naughty librarian! (1 year). Each of these women were 1-3 inches taller than me. Among these past relationships I am a still friends with two of these women and they are really great ladies, we were ultimately just not meant to be. Between these relationships were periods of about a year were I really just wanted to have a good time and meet women without a long term commitment. They were fun times. 

Even though I was successful I still actively worked to improve myself. I hit the gym, ate healthy, read voraciously, cultivated interesting hobbies, volunteered, finished an undergrad (Operations Analysis), finished another one (Accounting), and finished a graduate degree (MBA), and moved up in my career. 

After the end of my relationship with the librarian I took a handful of months to get myself in the right place to date again. I was 28. I had never tried online dating and figured that I was a decent catch so “Why Not!” I spent the effort and time to create a well-written profile. Messaged women with things I noticed from their profile and was generally light and funny. Then crickets. Zero. No responses. I kept at it for a couple of weeks and an attractive girl messaged me back. A few fun exchanges later we were talking via messenger and there seemed to be chemistry. In mid message she stopped and told me that she just realized that I was 5’5”. I was a little surprised as she was 5’2”. She apologized for not noticing it sooner. I don’t do needy so I wished her good luck on her dating adventures. Thereafter, I scanned across all the women to whom I had sent messages. I realized that in their preferences that it was 6’ + fellas they were all after. Clearly online dating was not mine, or any short guy’s, avenue to success. The profile went into the great abyss.

A few weeks later I was in invited to a friend of a friend’s Halloween party. The hostess was a 33-year-old 5’8” brunette, dressed as a cowgirl, with legs that stopped at my mid stomach. Not that I noticed. I had a great time that night and really tried to just enjoy interacting with all of the people at the party. When I went to leave for another party the hostess came out after me and asked me if I wanted to get together some time. We exchanged numbers and I promised to give her a call. 

Fast forward five years. That hot hostess is now my fiancé. We live together. I have steadily progressed through my career. I supported her when she decided to go back and finish nursing school. We have a home in a great part of town. We travel and I recently paid for a trip to Europe as part of her graduation present. Neither of us wants children so we are saving more aggressively for retirement. None of this would have happened if I would have let the preference of a stranger on an online dating site color my self worth. 




**So for the short guys reading this here is my advice:**

Hit the gym, Change your diet. Check your hygiene. Pick up a book that enhances your life. Evaluate your character. Grab a buddy or a girl with great taste to help you change your style; it can be done cheaply. Find a tailor so your clothes fit properly. Get a better haircut. If you are balding buzz it off. Get your ass back in school. Go to a Toastmasters class. Out work everybody at your job and then work smarter. Make yourself indispensable. Be the guy people go to when they need to get shit done. Quit trying to date online. Never be needy. Don’t worry about the outcome of interacting with women and just enjoy the ride. Be more concerned with your partner’s pleasure than yours in the sack. Be nice to people you don’t want anything from and don’t worry about people who treat you poorly as it is their problem. Constantly talk to women regardless of attraction. Most importantly, add value to the interpersonal experiences of people around you. It takes a while, but do these things and it will work itself out. If not, then sorry dude, you are not a catch; at any height.




**For the women reading this that are holding out for a 6’1” prince charming, a little advice as well:**

Don’t hold on to those unrealistic expectations too long. Don’t believe me then Google dating for women after 30. Seriously depressing stuff. Ageism for over 30 women is apparently the heightism that men experience in their 20s. 

Also consider the following point.

The girl that brushed me off for my height while online dating, do you think if she would have given it a shot, that she would have found the following desirable in a potential partner?

Above average attractiveness, fit, great sense of style, humorous, loyal, caring, supportive, highly educated and applying to PhD programs, financially secure with a great career and a salary just a hair under six figures and growing.

Faced with the same decision at 35, do you think she would still care that he is only a couple inches taller than her? Would you? If so, Godspeed and good luck!




**And...Finally for the women who would gladly date a short guy if he is a catch:**

You are simply awesome! Short, tall, whatever you are, you rock! Seriously. Give me your address and I will be by in a couple minutes to hug you personally. 

Also..please keep letting us short fellas prove our worth based on what we are about and how we treat you and not our stature. I bet you will continue to find a guy that appreciates you in a way that a tall guy never will


**Wow so there have been some interesting takes on my experience and advice.  I will really add only one more thing and leave it where it stands.**

So solving all of the societal ills of a short man’s existence was a little outside of the scope of a post describing my personal experience and the advice I would lend. However as it was mentioned, I think it is worth addressing. Do short men suffer embarrassment, discrimination, lowered earnings potential, stereotyping, and derisions like “Napoleon Complex”? Absolutely.  Do women? Who else?  Do you actively support their causes?  Have you actively started your own cause?

So lets take that down the rabbit hole.

Let’s assume that /r/short somehow captures the attention of the public at whole. Let’s assume that brilliant arguments are made about the injustices short men face. The government, and society take serious a call for equality. How long does it take for these changes to become part the environment? How long until people’s stereotypes begin to fade? How long until earnings potential are the same? How long until there is a functioning equality? 5 days? 5 weeks? 5 months? 5 years? 5 decades? 5 generations?

It doesn’t make any sense to wait for some sort of overriding societal change to make the best of the situation. My life is now. So is yours. I am not going to squander years in the hopes that this happens. Especially when I have the power to control many of the outcomes of my life. 

So do you.

I asked her out Wednesday after our game, she said yeah and was going to give me her phone number but I didn't have my phone on me.  She gave me her number through facebook later.  [See conversation here.  I am ""M"" and she is ""S.""](http://imgur.com/a/2PFDL)

I feel like she said yes for whatever reason initially and then may have wanted to back out.  That is fine.  I have met and accepted defeat many times, it's not an issue.  I wish she been clearer by saying something like ""I don't want to go on a date with you.""  It stings, but in all my manly manliness I can handle it.  At least now I wouldn't be thinking about it.  It bothers me because it seems like a plausible excuse (who would come up with apartment renovations as a lie?).  On the other hand, it also bothers me because I think she has roommates, and had she really wanted to go she would have either

* found someone to cover for her or
* asked about going another day instead of just leaving it up in the air.

Now I will see her tonight for frisbee (this should be fun).  &lt;-- that was said with sarcasm at first, and mixed feelings afterwards, because I actually do love playing frisbee :)

So there it is, /r/short, I lay my failures out in front of you for your entertainment.  My friends, (especially ladies), any insight here?

EDIT: A few photos popped up on my facebook account.  It looks like she went to a 5k run with a guy on Sunday (they're looking pretty friendly in the pictures), and then there are pictures of her making a mess of his bed.

I argue (and have been doing so on my AtEyeLevel blog for some time now), that this is 99% social. That is, humans as a species are different in that we can use logic and survival of the species does NOT depend on the ""fittest"" (what is ""fit"" is debatable), but on the most ""adaptable"". Strength and height means zilch if one cannot adapt. Being taller is useless if a shorter group has better technology, fighting ability, etc.

The following links are well known, but illustrate studies by anthropologists that in some of the remaining hunter gather, male mate selection does not show any link to size (when looking at the entire population) 

http://www.citeulike.org/user/fxdm/article/10255410
http://www2.lse.ac.uk/newsAndMedia/news/archives/2009/07/HadzaResearch.aspx

Within the primates, male dominance is determined by display and networking, NOT size (the assumption is that larger males are preffered in all species).

The quest is to debunk the psuedo science, and that the emphasis placed on height is largely social.

The problem is not that the studies above prove what can easily be deduced, but that since we live in a society where ""tall is all"", no one CARES to challenge this and conduct more studies like the aforementioned because favoring tall males is WIDELY ACCEPTED.

It would almost be like going against eugenics in 1913 or so.

I was given a lot of crap growing up, being the smallest guy in the classroom. Didn't take it though. The ill natured things I learned to roll with and stand up to, and the good natured things I learned to join in  on and enjoy.

Needless to say, my confidence got fostered early on and it has grown exponentially through the years. Too much some would say. 

I mean, I do think the sun shines out of my ass and I AM prone to you know... thinking I'm the maker's gift to humanity, but I hardly think this due to whatever early strides I might have made in regards to my height. Still, some of my friends tease that I am a textbook case of the whole Napoleonic complex watchumacallit. But as I understand it, that involves more, you know... resistance... to the whole thing. You know, refusing to accept the fact that hey, you are a shortie.

I'm quite comfortable with my height (as a martial artist, the lower center of gravity is quite nice, thank you very much), but I do wonder sometimes. Am I really all that confident or am I just a narcissist/napoleonic prick? How much of that is a result of my height and the way I dealt with growing up with it?

After being on here for a few days and even when I think about the stories of how my taller friends, I feel like my story of when I got big and how it affects me is a bit different than everyone else. Most of you all seem to have gotten your size early on.

Throughout high school I was actually a short, fat kid (with a speech impediment). I was alright at sports, but never great due to my lack of size (seriously was about 5'2"" as a freshman and about 150 lbs). It was kind of difficult making friends and being accepted, but the plus side is that I'm still great friends with the ones that I did make.

Right before college, I finally shot up to the 6' range and went through the whole awkward, gangly phase. Finally in the past couple years, I really came into my size with filling out my frame, etc.

The whole time though, I just find it weird. I never view myself as a big person (until I see pictures of me with my shorter friends). For me it's just kind of crazy that I went from a social outcast to what I am now. If I go out, I'm usually the center of attention and girls that I used to not have any chance with will constantly come up to me (no tall ones of course :( Ohio is a short area apparently).

For me its just crazy that I haven't changed as a person (except ditching the speech impediment) but yet my whole social aspect and interaction with people has changed just due to my height.

Essentially, I was a shorter person who became a much bigger person (6'6"").  Feel free to fire away with any questions about the experience and I'll try to respond depending on how busy work gets.

TL;DR: Got tall, got popular

(Positive ending, don't worry :))",16,7,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/short/comments/1ifa33/the_long_short_of_it_positive_ending_dont_worry/,"Today, I just realized how it tough you have to mentally be when you are a short guy. Sorry, not realized but 'confirmed' that thinking because no matter what, people will either use your height as a reason for your behavior or quote some sort of inferiority complex as a reason. However, as shitty as it is, I've really learned how to be tough and not give two shits about anything. 


For example, my own sister got into an argument with me about some stupid shit and said something about how short I was. Even though- even though my height had nothing to do with the argument. She is 5'0 and I'm 5'3. I'm 18 and my family is Asian. My heart in some ways sunk because it showed me that no matter what, in the back of someone's mind, my height or ""lack of it"" is always somehow going to be an issue and the reason why I am the way I am. I was taken back, because she was my older sister, and I thought that if family members have this thought about short guys, then what about other people who won't think twice about being ignorant in your face.


However, this is not the first time I experienced something like this - like school, but this time, I learned that I can either let it affect me and be sad, depressed, whatever, or just not give a shit and focus on even harder on becoming whatever I want to become, a musician, a photographer, whatever. This was in a way really freeing for me because I've always been in semi-denial about my height and always thought that if I didn't mention height, or wasn't self-deprecating about it, then height doesn't matter. There goes that theory. For some reason now 'm really happy, because I can now say people do notice height no matter what, so fuck it and I'm going do what I was meant to do.


This was my enlightening moment. What's yours?


TL;DR: Accept the fact that people do notice height, and will be ignorant about it. However, be really, really realistic and focus on things you can do, any talents you can develop. Put simply, do things that you would normally do despite your lack  of height or if you were someone of average or above average height.

I'm a 15 year old boy (5'1""|156cm) with not so tall parents (5'2""|158cm / 5'5""|168cm). However, my brother is 3 years older than me and I always measured myself in adjustment to him at my current age. I remember when he was 13, he was about the same heigth as I am now and he immediately started to grow back then. 

When I was 13 though I was about 4'8""|145cm. Now I am not very self-confident even if people expect me to be so and it's seriously bothering me to be that small. I'm taller than all of the girls in my class and just recently someone took a guess at my age and thought I was about 10-11 years old.

About a year ago we drove to a doctor and they did some research over my carpal bone (I'm sure you guys/girls know what I mean).

Result was, they said I'm going to be about 5'8""|178cm tall.
While I would be absolutely satisfied with that, I'm trying to be realistic and I don't see that happening anymore. My brother who has always been taller than me has just recently stopped growing (He's 18) and he's about 5'7""|173cm tall.

A full beard is a face screaming raging testosterone. Everyone registers a full beard as all-out masculinity, even if they are looking down on you from a foot above.

Now hold up, we are NOT talking about a lame-ass 5 day pretty boy stuble, a goatee, a chin strap, or hipster mustache, or any similar weak ass shit. I'm talking about a full on full FULL face beard untrimmed for at least 5 months.

THIS! is what I'm talking about:
http://ianinthefuture.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/zach-beard1.jpg

Take this anecdote as you will, but it has been transformative for me. I went from being a ""cute"" 5'4"" guy, to ""damn, Paul Bunyan??"". The effects are unbelievable. For the first time in a while I look my age. Everywhere I go, people have started listening.

The hardest part is fighting people's first negative reactions. Your family and friends won't approve of it. They mean well, but they don't get it. They might says some harsh things like it makes you look ugly or accuse you of trying to compensate. Ignore them. They will get used to it.

 You might worry if it makes you less attractive to girls, especially the ones that say they don't like facial hair. Ignore that as well; women don't know what they are attracted to. They certainly are not attracted to the cute you. They are attracted to the masculine you. That beard is the alpha-ness that lurks beneath and wants to ooze out of your face... If you could just stop taking a fucking razor to it every morning.

Last point: to make it work, you have to own it. Don't walk around with that deadly facial weapon with a meek attitude. The full-on beard needs an assertiveness that needs to be expressed. Don't worry, it will be easy. The beard is an alpha signal people rather not displease or fuck around with.

It sounds weird but its insane how effective it is. Our society is conditioned by arbitrary things, and people's first impression is so automatic. They don't stop to ask themselves why they are so fuckin impressed by a full on beard any more than they stop to ask themselves why a 5'10"" man should be considered any more impressive than a 5'5"" one, it just happens in their head and it is done.

TL;DR: if you think your short height detracts from your social presence, then a full-face beard will more than make up for it

If height was normally distributed then there should be just as many guys who are 4'10"" as there are 6'10"" and that just doesn't seem accurate. 

I could obviously be wrong but is it possible that height is *not* normally distributed? If it's not normally distributed then it's most likely that the median height is actually slightly below the mean height and that there could be a fair amount of bunching happening in the slightly below-average range.

My question is, how does r/short feel about directly challenging heightism versus conforming to the prejudice to make ones life easier?  Yes, the question is purely hypothetical, but interesting none the less.  We know that conforming to social norms is always the easiest path in life.  But, does r/short believe that fighting heightism (assuming that such a thing can be done) is more important than following the path of least resistance?  

I am genuinely curious to hear what others think about this.  And again, let's leave the question about whether heightism can actually be challenged to the side.  Let's stipulate (for the sake of argument) that heightism could be effectively challenged through rejecting social norms and reasoned arguments.  Would such a challenge be worth sacrificing some social comfort?

First thing first, I'm sorry that some people left. It is sad to see that.

I've been getting quite a lot of messages both on here and on facebook saying that the subreddit is becoming too negative with people ranting and others are saying that they should be able to express their feelings because this is a subreddit for short people. I don't know if this makes sense or not but I got a solution.



Since some of you can't get along and decide that the best thing to do is just leave, actually, let me say this before I go on. Instead of complaining of the post quality and expecting everyone else to make these amazing posts, how about YOU make one and try to improve the subreddit? 

Of course, that's not the point, I am a little tired and a little upset seeing my beloved subreddit fall apart. 


So, the solution is, we will have TWO different subreddits. You can visit both of them and you can be active in both.


This current subreddit, /r/short will be for ONLY positive posts that show how awesome we are! You want to share your experiences with the other short folk and you're happy then this is the place for you.


If you feel like venting and you need to take your frustration out on something then go to /r/short_help. I will improve on it and both subreddits hopefully will be better.


Please, subscribe to both and help people in need. You need to understand that some people are going through tough times and just making a post to vent could be very helpful for them. 


In other news, I am looking for mods. Send me PM describing WHY you would be a good fit and which subreddit you would like to moderate. I need at least 1 person who is very good with CSS.



**TL;DR**: 2 new subreddits. r/short is for positive posts. /r/short_help is for venting. Looking for mods.

Since I'm a male, I'll mostly be referring to guys here, but I'm sure it's similar for women too. 

It's said that tall guys are noticed more. Can be more assertive. Are more likely to be [successful](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Height_discrimination#In_business). Are more likely to be viewed as [attractive](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Height_discrimination#Dating_and_marriage). 

In my experiences, I've generally found this to be true - at first. When you walk into a room at a party, you notice the tall guy first. Maybe he's the one talking with a group that has gathered around him. But beyond that, however optimistic it may sound, isn't it more about your personality? I've found that if I appear confident, personable, and active, I can *gather* the respect that the tall guy may get initially. In many cases, ""confident"" means not bringing up your height or noticing it at all whatsoever. I don't say this to sound cocky. I say it because a lot of the time, just being a nice guy makes it so being short doesn't matter for me at all. 

How much has the tall-noticeable-guy scenario affected you all? Have you ever had to change your behavior because of it? Do you not notice this at all?

Before I say anything, I want to comment on two things I know are going to draw attention.
1.) Yes, I am using experiences from my personal life. This is my own personal view.
2.) This is not a ""throwaway"". I've posted on reddit a while back, but I forgot my password to my other account. So this is just a break from the lurking I have done for about a year.

Okay,so now back to the title. It seems that the majority of you guys believe that being short is a disadvantage, and some of you even go beyond that to say its life-alteringly bad. I am here to present my own view about the numerous advantages of a short male height, starting from (in my opinion) weakest to strongest.

1.) I don't think that short guys are not given chances to lead or be dominnant. I know that this is just purely speculation. People treat me with great respect and often show deference to me. I am pretty sure that this is not the average experience though. I do however, think that short guys can make very powerful leaders from the contrast between perceived physical power and social power (think Scarface).I know that this is not a very good ""reason"" but like I said it is my weakest and I just wanted to get that out there.

2.)Short guys can build muscle so easily. So easily. It is so much easier to fill out a five foot frame than a six foot one. You can get so muscular so fast its insane.

3.) You can do more with that muscle. Body weight exercises are so much easier and the heights (ha) you can achieve are so much greater. You can lift 2x your weight much easier.  You can maneuver  and climb so much better (there was this one Japanese ninja show that had the contestants do insane things in order to win and the things it demands from the body can pretty much only be achieved by a short man).

3a.) Which means you can handle Gs better. You can be a fighter pilot or operate the next awesome sort of machine our brains event. You have a low center of gravity if you're into grappling.

4.) You can endure longer. You will be able to run for longer than someone taller than you. This is incredibly valuable in my opinion.

5.) You need less. Generally speaking, you will eat less than someone twice your size. Also valuable.

6.) You're more comfortable. Planes, beds, showers, the list goes on and on. Things are built to the lowest possible specification to save money. I have never seen a tall person comfortable on an aircraft, even in first class.

7.) You live longer. I think this one speaks for itself. How cool is that? 

There are probably some other things I've not mentioned, but this is all that came to me at the time. I just really wanted to write this post.

I don't know why that's been the case and I honestly don't think anything of it ; I just thought it was interesting.

The only disadvantage I believe comes with being short is that women don't like it. And to that I honestly say ,""who cares"". I don't and I don't think you should either. But that's just my opinion.

But, I've heard several people online claim that they know a short guy who always blames his troubles on his height or always makes self-deprecating jokes about his height or constantly makes references to his height while in public.  

Is this a thing?  

Part of the reason that I love places like /r/short is that it gives us the opportunity to talk about subjects which are pretty much socially forbidden.  The thought never occurred to me to speak to anyone about height in real life.  I never mention my short stature to others, nor do I ever make jokes about myself based on height.

I can remember only one time in my life when I had a conversation about height in real life, and it wasn't about me.  It was about ""heightism"" in a broad sense and it was a conversation among friends which occurred naturally after we somehow ended up on the topic of Human Growth Hormone.  

But anyway, how many people here mention their height in real life?  And in what context?  And how often?  And what do you hope to accomplish by doing so?

(for the record, I've never known a short guy who was eager to talk about height - but maybe it's really ""a thing"" and I'm just not aware of it)

I've been following this subreddit for quite a while now, and I have been thinking about a lot of issues that short men here complain about, mainly regarding girls.

The guys that I objectively think as ""too short"" are usually skinny, and don't have a lot of physical presence. 

On the other hand, when I see a well-built shorter guy, ""short"" is never the first thought that comes to my mind: I don't even notice his height usually.

So, my point is, for those of you who think their height might be an issue with women, maybe it's just a lack of physical presence in general: not just vertically :)


And the good news is that, unlike height, it can be solved with some work and a lot of food!

It felt weird at first so I was sure people would notice and laugh at me for wearing them, but I don't think anyone did!  They give me 3 extra inches putting me at juuuuuust slightly above 5'9"" with them on.  It's was like night and day honestly. It was so refreshing to be in a crowd and not be painfully reminded how much smaller I was than every other guy in the room.  I didn't see the harm in wearing them more and more, especially in public because most of the time i'm not going to see these people ever again.  I swear even a few more girls were checking me out, but even if not it was a huge confidence booster.  Problem was I don't ever want to wear my flipflops again, but I didn't let it concern me, until now.

Just for the hell of it I updated my OKCupid profile to 5'9.  I know that's a lie but I just wanted to see what would happen.  I'm not sure if that's what did it but I actually got a girl to message me out of the blue a few days later!!!

I didn't want to get in a situation where she might want to hook up and thus forcing me to take off my shoes.  We haven't set up anything else yet but we're definitely going to!  How many dates should I go out with her before I can take off the lifts?  My plan right now is next time I hang out with her is to wear normal sneakers that maybe only add 1.5 inches, and once she's used to that wearing my flip flops again.  I just can't stop thinking about showing up in normal shoes again and her calling me out on it, but I think if I can get a few more dates she might not care anyways.

I get the impression that a lot of you guys are in your 20s and are a little bent because you think it's hard to attract women. I'm 42 so maybe I can offer a little advice because age theoretically imparts wisdom.

I don't believe for a second that there aren't millions of women out there who do find short guys attractive. I've never had a problem dating women throughout my life. I've dated short, medium, and plenty of tall women and married a beautiful woman 4 inches taller than myself. The first thing you have to do is stop believing that there aren't women out there who will date short guys. There are plenty who won't, who cares? There are plenty who won't date guys for a million other reasons besides height.

Women are attracted to confidence, intelligence, and humor. I think confidence is the key. Not arrogance, confidence. Get that confidence however you need to but don't base it on how many women you attract or think you should be attracting. Every guy who does that, short, medium or tall, inevitably comes across as desperate and/or not confident. Be good at something else. Athletics, your job, a hobby, whatever. It doesn't matter. When you become confident in yourself, truly believe in it, that will come across in all your interactions and most women will see past the height thing.

I am a 5'7 male. I know that's not considered uber short, but in my family, it's very disconcerting to me.

I turned 20 last week, and on top of not being the tallest guy, I have a very young looking face. I get carded for 14A movies on occasion and while I brush it off when it happens in public, I dwell on it a lot longer privately.

My younger brother is 17 and towers over me at 6'2. My father is 6'1 and my mother is rather short at 5'3. I understand it appears I got mostly her genetics, but I don't like going out with my family and constantly being mistaken for a child. I tried to address this by losing weight and bulking up, but it still has yet to help. I'd say my body looks pretty good, but my face is still young looking which does not help with my height.

On top of this, a lot of my friends and family friends are very tall people, as is the rest of my family. My 13 year old cousin came to visit recently and he is my size now. When we went out as a family, people thought he was older than me.

At this point, I no longer want to go out with my family and I'd rather just stay in and be alone than be publicly humiliated over and over again.

I know it sounds like im whining, but I'm hoping somebody has some sort of advice for me on how to deal with this. I still have this faint hope in the back of my mind that i'l grow some more, but it fades more and more each day.

Does anyone have any advice that may help out? Honestly, it's gotten to a point where I don't see the point in things anymore when I constantly get ridiculed.

Hi r/short



The mod team just had our 3rd mod meeting, which I think went great.


~~We've talked about a lot of stuff but the topic that was brought up the most was the recent influx of negative posts/comments towards members of r/tall.~~


~~After long discussion, we decided that we will be removing posts that are making fun of, putting down or hateful towards our sister subreddit, r/tall.~~


~~I think that it is the best thing to do and it will prevent a lot of negativity and hate between the subreddits.~~

~~I have a lot of respect for the mods at r/tall and I believe that they also don't tolerate similar behavior towards our subreddit but even if they allow it, we will be the bigger man and do what's best for both of us.~~


~~I understand that some people get upset and they need to let the steam off but fighting fire with fire won't solve anything. So, let's be respectful towards each other and make sure that our subreddit stays as a positive place for short folk to hang out, NOT a place where everyone is negative.~~


In other news, I recently made few posts about flair and that we will make a little game out of it. 

The idea is pretty simple. Every month, on a certain day, mods will have a meeting and pick a user that has been contributing a lot and improving the overall quality on this subreddit (it can be reporting links that are spam/trolls, making insightful posts that start discussions/help short people in a certain way, etc.). 

I believe that this will give a competitive feel to the subreddit and bring the quality of posts/comments up. It will encourage the users to post more and make the subreddit a little bit more fun (and unique, in a way). 

I also think that it will make the job of mods much easier since readers will be reporting bad posts and comments. 


Unfortunately, I'm the one that apparently knows CSS the most out of the mods and I don't know much, that and the fact that I'm busy with my school/soccer it all prolongs the finish date. 

Hopefully I will fix it in next 2 weeks and then find another way to improve our subreddit. 



This is it.

I ask because personally, the only guys I've ever known to express concerns about dating a woman taller than them have been average to tall guys. Then the tall women I've known, the concerns they've quoted guys having about the woman's height have overwhelmingly been things that I could easily reframe as ""guy doesn't like facing the social stigma associated with being short"". So from my limited perspective, it seems like some of the dating troubles tall women face are because when they date ""shorter than me but still tall compared to most women"" guys, they're dating guys who are used to their tall male privilege - something that would be less likely when dating guys who are objectively short, instead of compared-to-me short.

Is my sample size simply not representative of most guys? Are there short guys reading this who genuinely dislike dating Women taller than them, or should I be pointing out to my taller female friends that if they date genuinely short guys, they're dating people who are *used* to the stigma of being short men, and have (hopefully) already come to terms with it?

I mean, if you think about it, who would be more likely to be bothered that a woman was taller than them - someone used to being taller than women, or someone used to women being taller than them?

Well, I found out why later that year when by chance we were in a class together.  I get to talking with him randomly and it turns out, he's one of the most genuinely nice guys i've come across.

And not once did I ever hear him put someone down or make fun of them, he actually made me embarrassed for myself when I tried to steer the conversation in the direction about something dumb someone else in the class had said.  By the end of the year I never even thought about his height because of the presence he had, and it was no mystery at all why he had a hot girlfriend and friends.  People wanted to be around him.

I wonder if all short guys were like him if the stereotypes would even exist, because guys like him made you forgot about his height altogether.  ",,False,self,t5_2sgvi,False,,,True,t3_1k1y4c,http://www.reddit.com/r/short/comments/1k1y4c/so_this_guy_i_knew_positive_story/,

I've seen a few people talking about those in this subreddit so I thought i could share my experience. I'm 19 yo and 5'7 (170 cm). I decided to buy a pair of elevator insoles a few months back, I imported them from China and they were dirth ship (like 4 dollars I think), so I though ""what do I have to lose by trying""? At first I thought about hiding them, but when I received them and started using them I realized it wouldn't be possible, especially from my family and close friends. So I decided to be upfront about it and when someone asked about them I just said that I wanted to try it out. Maybe my family and friends think something about it but since I didn't make a big deal about it it doesn't seem really important to them. Again even if I don't talk much about it they know I'm a bit insecure about my height, no need to lie about it. Most of us on this subreddit probably are. I think that's the main thing, dont even try to hide them and get trapped in a spider of petty lies.

My insoles are 3 cm (like 1.2 inches I think, the shortest possible and unless you have special shoes the only ones that can fit) so I basically go from 1.70m to 1.73 and 5'7 to 5'8. I sure did gain some confidence. The world didn't change though. Where it changed most is with girls. I don't know if it's because I gained confidence or because of these 3 cm. I think the main reason is that at 1m70 I was maybe taller than 70% of the girls of my age, and taller than 40% when they were wearing heels. (random stats from my experience). I was kind at the critical height between the ""short guy"" and the ""kind of short guy"". Again that would be only my imagination but that's how I felt it.


To sum it up, insoles are dirt cheap (be careful with the size though) so I would recommend to anyone to try them out. Don't lie about it. Don't always wear them , it would be counter productive if not wearing them actually decrease your confidence. I would compare it to wearing make up (i know that makeup is more socially acceptable), wear them when you meet new people to make a better impression. I know that may sound like surrendering to heightism but let's face it, being short is not an attractive feature.

If you have any question, feel free :)

I'm working on a book on Height and collection of data regarding Heightism with my AtEyeLevel blog.

""Height Shaming"" will be one of the chapters. Think of Fat Shaming, but toward height. Probably affecting men more than women, but constant exposure to this CAN have an affect on the psyche depending on the individual. 

This post from Geoffry Arnold's TheSocialComplex Tumblr blog comes to mind when thinking of Height Shaming. It's about a 5'5 guy in Scandinavia who is taunted due to his height - http://thesocialcomplex.tumblr.com/post/25960243507/heartbreaking-taunts-at-midsummer

I wish I could say I was 5'8 but I feel like I'd be lying to myself.


One story about this chick that I'd liked for a long time; We only hung out during the summers but I had liked this girl for years and from 14-18 we just kind of joked around and flirted. But when we turned 18 that summer it got more physical too. Anyways, recently we've drifted apart recently and I saw her this past summer for the first time in years and so we were at a party and I said 'hey, let's sit down' and she goes ""is that because no one can tell your height when you sit down"". Needless to say we don't really get along anymore (not because of this incident, we just drifted apart). This sucked for 2 reasons; 1. Who knows, that's probably true. I never thought of it like that but yeah, I can agree that being at a party and standing up sucks when all the guys are 6'0 and even the women are taller than you because they're wearing heels. 
2. I feel like my height doesn't get brought up too much because I'm pretty athletic so I'm not scrawny so when people acknowledge the fact that I'm small hurts a lot more. 

(3) Also, jesus, I wanted to keep it cool and try to hook up with her, when she said that it was like a total confidence booster for a little- even though I played it off like I didn't care. I'm not one of those guys who finds it easy to insult women and I'm too much of a pussy to insult girls I like to 'be the bad boy' so there was literally nothing I could say as a retort/reply.


I'm not ashamed of being short but it's definitely something I'd change if it could magically happen. And I wouldn't even ask to be like 6'2. I feel like 5'9 5'10 is the perfect height if you're a guy. Tall enough that when a chick is next to you in heels you're both a roughly the same height. 

Like I said before, as I don't get the short taunts that often, I never hear it happening, although I'm the same height as other people who are talked about as being short so no doubt people talk about me being a short guy when I'm not around.


All in all, I kind of like it. It sets you apart. Also I feel like the only person you can joke about being short with is another short person (guy or girl). I feel like every short guy is kind of fighting a battle and it's nice to meet someone who's fighting it too.

Now all of a sudden since I'm back in the dating pool I feel short! Although I've been told frequently I'm above-average looking, this doesn't seem to help with women. The only women I can seem to get attention from are not very attractive or are super short (which I'm not opposed to, I just don't meet a lot of them).

And as heightism is a prejudice which is part of a pervasive social construct which says that shorter people are inherently inferior to taller people - we all start off believing this myth to some extent.  When I was very young, I too assumed that shorter people were ""not as good as"" or ""less than"" taller people, and I simply accepted this in my thoughts and actions.  It wasn't something that bothered me, even though I was a short boy, because I regarded it as natural and I never framed it as a type of prejudice.  Looking back, I was sometimes ignored or treated differently than taller people, but I wasn't bothered by this fact - I would simply defer to taller kids even though I understood (on some level) that I was limited (if even slightly) because of my height.  But again, I didn't understand the concepts of socialization or stigmatization because they never taught things like that at my High School.  

However, later I went to college (an intellectually rigorous liberal arts school) and was introduced to a lot of ""new"" ideas and ways of looking at the world.  It was then that I first started looking back on my life and questioning things about height and society that I had taken for granted.  Also, thanks to the internet, I was introduced to the concept of ""heightism"" for the first time.  

But though a lot of things happened which confirmed my suspicions about heightism, I didn't really fully ""get it"" until I was about to leave University.  And ironically, it took a couple of tall guys to make me realize how limiting and degrading heightism could be.

As a result, I ended up attending an ""accepted students weekend"" at a highly ranked east coast school.  And at the end of the event, there was a cocktail reception which was sponsored by a large law firm.  The Dean of the Law School was there, as well as several professors and the Dean of Admissions.  

So, I'm standing around a circle of admitted students, one professor, and two lawyers from the sponsoring law firm (tall guys - maybe 6'2"" and 6'4"").  Some of us have glasses of wine or plates of finger food in our hands, but everyone is socializing and talking about our plans for the future.  I'm the shortest male there, but I'm not really thinking about height - everyone seems pretty nice and I'm starting to think that this might be the school for me.  

Then, the Dean of Admissions approaches our group and starts to enter the conversation.  As is appropriate, he goes around the circle and starts shaking the hands of the admitted students while telling them ""congratulations"" and ""we hope to see you in the Fall"", etc.  So, here is the kicker:  He shakes everyone's hand in the circle, but he stops right before he gets to me.  That is, he shakes the hand of the guy standing right next to me, but then his eyes glance right through me and he steps back...not acknowledging me, even though it seems like he saw me.   

At this point, everyone has noticed what has just happened and I feel my face flush with embarrassment.  My mind instantly starts making up excuses for the Dean.  ""Oh Geoff, he didn't notice you standing there""....""It couldn't have been intentional""....""Don't say anything or you'll embarrass the Dean"".  So, I could sort of feel myself shrinking away - trying to slip outside of the circle as not to press the issue or insert myself into somewhere that I wasn't invited.   

But as I was shuffling away from the group, I happened to look up towards the two tall male lawyers in the group.  To this day, I can't quite accurately describe the reaction on their faces.  But it was somewhere between shock and utter horror - both of their mouths were agape. 

**THAT** was the moment that I realized that heightism is a serious social problem.  I was aware of heightism by that point, but even then I was affirming it though my thoughts and actions.  I was already making excuses for the Dean when I was SURE that he saw me.  It's just that he didn't acknowledge me as someone worthy of a handshake.  He didn't acknowledge me as someone to be taken seriously and so he snubbed me.  Sure, if he had been thinking clearly he would have shaken my hand, but his mind was on social autopilot and so he saw me and made a snap judgement about my presence -  *""not important""* - and I apparently agreed with him because I accept his judgment and tried to slink away; as we were both socialized in a heightist environment.  It took the look on a pair of tall guy's faces to wake me up to what I already understood.  While I should have barked ""Excuse me, Sir!"", instead my mind made a normative assessment of the situation based on how I'd been socialized throughout my childhood; coming to the conclusion that ""Geoff, you're short, and so you can't blame people for treating you like that"".

But after seeing the look on two tall guy's faces, my mind said ""This is Wrong"" and I froze in mid step.  After what seemed like an eternity (but which was probably only a few moments) one of the tall lawyers cleared his throat and signaled to the Dean.  To the relief of everyone, The Dean tried to clean it up by shaking my hand, but I don't even remember if I smiled or looked him in the eye or anything.  My mind was racing and I probably looked like a zombie as I was limply shaking his hand.  It's like my whole world was falling apart in that moment even though I'd been treated poorly because of my height hundreds of times before that.    

The main difference now was that I linked the experience to a widespread social prejudice which goes unaddressed in our society but poisons the potential of promising individuals for something that is beyond our control.  Short guys are socialized to accept poor treatment that other guys would never tolerate as a matter of course.  And it was then that I suddenly realized that I probably wouldn't have even been admitted to the school if the Dean had met me in person, instead of simply reading an essay and looking at my GPA and LSAT score.  And I wondered how many other qualified people are denied opportunities because of their height and the role it plays in interpersonal interactions.  

It goes without saying that I didn't attend that Law School.          

So, DAE have a similar story to tell, or am I alone in this?    

**tl;dr** - Dean of Admission ignores me, doesn't shake my hand at an admitted student's weekend and I make excuses for him until I see the expression on taller guys' faces - thereby realizing that I can no longer accept heightism in my own life or in society generally.

Is this because longer legs make the former easier? I sort of flick between both ways, but I think my legs are too thick to achieve the 'taller' way fully. Or maybe my jeans are too tight.

Observation 3: All women cross their legs sort of like tall men, but with calves pointing backwards rather than forwards.

I've seen comments by short women on /r/short comparing the **discrimination of short men to sexism**. I think this is not a good comparison.

There have been studies proving that women do get paid less on average than men. Why? Because they're comparing men with women in general. Not men and women in the same career with the same education working in the same place and getting the same results. 


They get paid equally. If women were actually paid 77 cents for every dollar that a man makes, why would people even hire men? If I had two (lets say lawyers) working at my firm and I could pay the men $100K and the [women $77K](http://whatmenthinkofwomen.blogspot.ca/p/ten-most-common-feminist-myths.html), why the hell would I ever hire men? If anything, men would be the ones with job issues.


So I see users with the pink flares always saying that heightism isn't a big deal and say ""whatever, women get paid less too"". Short men get paid [WAAAAAYYY less](http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/Careers/02/02/cb.tall.people/index.html) but that's cool because taller guys are more intelligent and better at their jobs. Perhaps sexism has been an issue for a long time, but guess what? **People fight sexism. There are hundreds of thousands, may millions, of people who support feminist movements. I don't think there are more (maybe not even) 20,000 people who fight against heightism.**

If I **joke about hating women and were to update my twitter or Facebook status's about how much I hate women and how disgusting they were, BOOM! I'm a sexist asshole who should burn in hell. If I judge a girl and say, there is no way that I am dating a girl who is a B-cup, BOOM! I'm a superficial asshole. It's genetic that they have smaller breasts, they didn't choose it. I'm not supposed to judge girls because of their body. It's not like it's a genetic thing in a man's brain that makes them find large breasts attractive so it's clearly not a good enough excuse. However, compare that to men's heights. It's totally cool to say that a girl would never date a short guy... plus its a genetic thing.**


I don't have anything against women and I think they should be treated equally to men. I think everyone should be treated equally regardless of height, race, gender, sexual preference, etc.

I knew I was smaller, but it wasn't really a conscious thought. Now that I'm slightly older, height consumes my every thought and probably many of my actions as well. I automatically guess someone's height when I look at someone. It's the first thing my brain hops to - age, race, gender, fashion preferences, demeanor - all of that comes second. At first, this was a conscious guessing game but now it's an autonomous and fluid reaction: ""Boom. That guy's 5' 8-10"".""Boom. She's 5' 6"". This isn't an audiation, it's like the firing of a synapse. No one knows this. I have never told anyone how self-fucking-conscious I am about my height. I've told my girlfriend that I wish I was taller, but that's as far as I've gone to expose my obsession. Not surprisingly, my height is the first thing most people notice about me, too.

According to my driver's license I was 5' 3"" when I was 18. When I was 17, I tore my ACL and had X-Rays taken of my knee which I later took to a doctor to see if my epiphyseal lines had closed; they have. However, since then I have measured myself to be 5' 4.5"" and I break 5' 5"" when I wear shoes. Did I actually grow after my epiphyseal lines closed, or did the DMV measure me incorrectly by a couple inches? I'm curious if anyone else has experienced growth after 21. My father is 6'0"" and my younger brother is 5' 11"".

In comparison to being tall, or even average, the pros far outweigh the cons of being tall. I don't need to tell you this. I can't be competitive without negative repercussion, which hurts because I am competitive by nature. People equate competition to aggression when you're short. A lot of the negatives stem from others' unconscious actions, which is indicative of how they interpret me. I'm the oldest of my three siblings and people often assume I'm the second youngest (my youngest sibling is 8 years younger than me so it's impossible to get that one wrong). I've been rejected by women solely based on my height, even by some who were shorter than me. Once I had a girl who was 4'11"" - 5' 0"" ask me what it was like to be short. Being drunk, I couldn't do anything but laugh. At this point I feel it is safe to assume that if she's taller than me, it's a no. I can't blame anyone for this, I totally understand their position - but it still hurts, you know? I'd say the majority of women I encounter are taller than me. If she puts on heels, she's definitely taller. I wouldn't want to date anyone who breaks a norm I'm not comfortable with. I wouldn't want to date me.

I got a shitty roll of the genetic dice. Is there anything to do but accept it? Should I ""deal with what was given"" to me? Can't I be average? I made average in every other department. I've considered height surgery and should I be blessed with financial success in the future, I'll probably go for it. How I'll explain growth of a few inches to my family and friends I do not yet know.

Writing this down feels good in the sense that my secret is now ""out in open. I laugh when someone mentions my height; that's the only thing I can do when someone inevitably brings it up. From the exterior, I appear happy. I appear comfortable in my skin. In my clique I'm the confident and outgoing one, but I definitely don't feel that way. I feel hollow.

I felt compelled to tell someone, so if you decided to listen - thank you!
