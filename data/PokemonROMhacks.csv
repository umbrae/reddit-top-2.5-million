- You're a grunt of Team Rocket.  

- It's a darker setting, and contains many pop culture references (GoT, Park and Rec, etc).   

- Pokedex: Original 151, all obtainable.  

- Testing: Has been tested, it's not perfect but is in it's final form.  

Tools Used: Advance Map, A-Trainer, Pokemon Amplifier, TS Cry Changer, Irfran Viewer, Cygnus Hex Editor, FSF, NTME, unLZ.GBA, APE, NSE 2.1, OverworldEditorRE.  

Edit: Advance Text would be on that list but I could never get it to work with my computer, hence the basic opening.

Edit 2: Fixed some bugs!

This is a randomizer program that takes a different route to the Reasonable gen3 randomizer recently released - instead of randomizing one set of games extremely thoroughly it aims to randomize every Pokemon game equally well, if not as thorough. It fills in the gaps of other randomizer programs by allowing full randomization of Gen4 &amp; Black2/White2 ROMs - something that could only be previously partially achieved using cheats.

Right now it supports every main-series English ROM, and can randomize the following things in them:

 * Starter Pokemon
 * Wild Pokemon
 * Trainers Pokemon
 * Pokemon Base Stats
 * Pokemon Types
 * Pokemon Abilities
 * Pokemon Movesets
 * TM Moves
 * TM/HM Learnability
 * Static Pokemon (e.g. given by NPCs, buyable at the casino, etc)
 * The moves that Move Tutors teach, in certain games where they are particularly significant.


The [download is here](http://code.google.com/p/universal-pokemon-randomizer/downloads/detail?name=UPRandomizer-120a.zip&amp;can=2&amp;q=) and you can get the source code [here](http://code.google.com/p/universal-pokemon-randomizer/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2Frandomizer)

The [version which doesn't need an external config directory is here](http://code.google.com/p/universal-pokemon-randomizer/downloads/detail?name=UPRandomizer-120a-InternalConfig.zip&amp;can=2&amp;q=). Use this if the original complains about missing config files even after extraction.

Future features:

 * Much more support for non-English ROMs
 * Foreign language support for the program itself
 * More cool ASM hacks that you can apply to the games to customize your experience a little bit further.

Feedback, criticism and suggestions are extremely welcome. This was very fun to make.

The patch only includes the data. It's meant as a base for rom hacks.

I then got in touch with the developer of the Gen 2/3 randomizer to see if he could edit it to include the 4th and 5th gen Pokemon. He did, and now we have a working randomizer for all 649 Pokemon. However, it is a bit buggy, and some Pokemon will cause the game to crash. I figure the more people we have playtesting it, the more bugs we'll catch.

Here's the link to the 649 patch: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/24219056/649%20Patch%20LB.ips

Hello /r/PokemonROMhacks! brownie here with great news. We’re bringing back the Featured Hack! It’s had quite a bit of time off and we’ve tweaked it and done our best to make it the most interesting event we can. So here are the new features in what I like to call Featured Hack 2.0!

* The featured hack will change once a month (Hack of the Month, aka HOTM).
* There will be a quarterly subreddit-wide vote to decide on their favorite HOTM (Hack of the Quarter, aka HOTQ).
* At the end of the year, there will be a vote on the four HOTQ's to decide on their favorite for the year (Hack of the Year, aka HOTY).

The HOTM’s will most likely only be hacks that are at least halfway done or have a considerable amount of game time. This way, we can actually justify having them featured for a full month.

That’s not all though! Do you have a new/upcoming hack that you want to share with the rest of us? If it has *at least* 4-6 hours of gameplay, it can be featured as a HOTM! But what if your hack isn’t quite that long yet? Don’t worry! We’ve thought of that too! We’ll just feature it as the “Featured Redditor’s Hack!” If you still have to submit your patch to the community, take a look at the new [guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonROMhacks/comments/13impw/mod_have_a_hack_you_want_to_share/) to see how you can share your hack with the community.

We’re not done yet! If you have any suggestions on what hack we should feature or how we should approach the event, feel free to send them to featuredhack@gmail.com or PM either myself or PunsAreFun. If you need help locating base ROMs to use for patching etc, please [send me a PM](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=browniebiznatch) and I'll do my best to make sure that you get what you need.

Think you would be interested in helping out with this? We are looking for a couple volunteers to help with the entire process! Please [send me a pm](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=browniebiznatch) with information as to why you should be considered for this project as well as your experience playing hacks. We will send you a PM in response as to whether you will join the team.

Starting out ordinarily enough, you and your brother run an errand for Professor Oak, but things go a bit awry and your brother, ever the troublemaker, finds himself involved with Team Rocket. He drags you in too, because “they’re not so bad.” Fight your way through the ranks of Rocket and the gyms of the region while some Pokémon cause big trouble for humanity. This hack features every Pokémon from the first three generations, with no need to trade. You may find yourself rebuilding your team with your favourites as the game progresses!

Alright everyone! It's the last day before we unveil the next Hack of the Week, so let's hear what everyone thought!

Personally, I liked it a lot. The Johto starters are a group of fairly balanced and reasonably powered Pokemon so I thought that the inclusion of those was perfect. The tileset has to be one of my favorites that I've seen in any hack before. The story itself was a little lacking, but that is most likely because it was such an incomplete hack.

As a result, the player sets out to defeat the Pokémon League in order to be accepted into the school.

It's a Flash game, meaning it's capable of being played in a browser as well as on a PC.  It's being made from scratch without an existing engine, so while it takes more work, it gives me so much more freedom on how the game will be played.  Anything that's been a staple of pokemon for over a decade, such as pokemon only having 4 moves or overworld movement being locked to a grid, can be changed, and it's exciting to have this opportunity.

You can try out a ""proof of concept"" of the battle system in your browser [here](http://www.swfme.com/view/1054502)!  And [here](http://imgur.com/a/ELtBy) is a screenshot album I made recently, which contains some very early versions of the overworld and title screen.

A large focus of Evoas is redefining the battle system.  The most obvious change is the graphical style.  Pokemon are animated, but also have animations for dealing and receiving damage.  Pokemon move around the fray too, meaning direct physical attacks will involve one pokemon actually walking up to the other and visually smacking it.  Additionally, the camera now views the battle from the side, and moves around to make moves more cinematic.  

The other big change Evoas brings to battles are the moves.  In this game, all fights are double battles.  But unlike Colosseum and XD, which reused pokemon attacks built for traditional 1 on 1 battles, the moves in Evoas have been created from the ground up with 2 on 2 battles in mind.  There's a much bigger emphasis on cooperation, with many moves designed to help allies.  About 75% of the moves will be completely new, and all the returning moves will be tweaked to have slightly different attack power or abilities.

There are a ton of other smaller changes made to the battle system that are too numerous to mention here.  I'd recommend you try out the preview listed above and find them out for yourself!

You can subscribe to the Pokemon Evoas [subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonEvoas/) or check out the game's [thread](http://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?t=305337) on pokecommunity.com where I will routinely post updates.

--------------------------------------------------

As you can see, this is quite the ambitious project.  Pokemon have to be given new sprites for attacking, taking damage, and even just looking sideways instead of toward the screen.  I was lucky enough to use sprites made by the talented Deviantart and SpritersResource user JoshR691, but I don't want to be limited to just including pokemon he's made sprites for.  I haven't been able to contact him either.

In short, I'm recruiting sprite artists to help me on Pokemon Evoas.  Well, ""begging"" might be the better term here.  Please, I could really use the artistic talent of anyone that has even a passing interest in my game.  I'm also interested in recruiting a music composer, writer, background artist, anything else really that can make this game as good as possible.  In return, I offer my skills as a programmer to help you on your personal project, if you have one.  If anyone needs help in AS3 or C++, I'm able to help.  If I believe this game has a lot of potential, and can really raise the benchmark for pokemon fan games if done correctly.

Well it's been an impressive few weeks for us in /r/PokemonROMhacks. Take a look at the subscriber count and the success of the HotWs if you don't believe me. I *hate* clichés but this could not have happened without you guys.

**A wild flair appears!**
 
To reward those of you who really put some effort in to helping this happen. We'll be giving out flairs to those of you who consistently post thoughtful, high quality, and worthwhile submissions and comments and  we'll also be giving away (different) flairs to those of you who go the extra mile in the Hack of the Week threads by posting screenshots, amusing stories, or information for other redditors.  
We also have a few ~~legen....wait for it... dary~~ flairs in reserve for those that really go that extra mile.

**Hack of the Weeks**  

The last couple of Hacks of the Week have been repetitive and a lot of you have voiced your opinion that we should feature more complete hacks. In the future complete hacks will become the 'Hack of the Fortnight' to enable people to have time to complete the hack. One of these should appear roughly every four hacks.

**Hacking Tutorials &amp; Community Hack**

A lot of you have been asking 'How do I start hacking?' and more often than not those thread have gone mostly unanswered. That sucks. To change that we're producing a series of tutorials that will cover the basics to help any of you who would love to start hacking get involved. The goal is that any one with an interest will be able to pick up the basics of ROM hacking by following the comprehensive guide. 

The screenshots and examples used in these guides will be all actual modifcations done to a base ROM that will be opened up for the community as the /r/PokemonROMhacks Community Hack. Anyone who has read and practised the tutorials should be able to contribute to the community hack. Hopefully the subreddit will produce one of the few complete ROM hacks out there.

**So how can I get involved?**

We're looking for tutorial requests, we want to know which areas of hacking you want to know about and we're also looking for hackers/spriters/mappers with previous experience to help write tutorials for the subreddit, a lot of you have in-depth knowledge in one specific area of ROM hacks and we'd love if you could share it with the whole community.  

We also want suggestions for the hack, this will be a ROM for everyone to play and although the initial modifications will be kept behind closed doors it'll be opened up to the community before an alpha version is released. 

What are your suggestions for?

* The ROM base used
* Tilesets used
* The plot
* The style of gameplay

Finally, we want to throw the gauntlet to you. What do you want to see more of, what do you want to see less of, and what don't you want to see at all? If you have *any* suggestions or ideas post them in the comments.

**tl;dr** New flairs for top contributors, hacking tutorials, a community hack will surface shortly, we want your ideas. Also looking for someone to condense my posts into a readable format.

I'm posting here because I wanted to share a real life story of a guy who really influenced people in terms of Pokemon Rom hacking in Korea.

So Circa 2005~2006. The foreign Pokemon Rom Hacking Scene is ""thriving"", with communities like Pokecommunity supporting Rom Hacks, and in Japan as well. In Korea, though, there was no such thing. So this guy whose Alias is Virus decided to create an Naver Cafe, which is a small forum-like site. It was called *Pokemon Rom Hacking Specialist*. He started to translate all the tools such as un-Lz, Advanced Map, etc into Korean and started to post guides on it. He mainly made Pokemon Gold Hacks because it was the only version at the time that was in Korean. In fact, he singlehandedly made the Table for the Hexcode to Text of Pokemon Gold Korean Version (This was very hard to do, since Korean has a lot of letters in terms of computers).

I found his site at around 2006, and started to make hacks for myself. When I first went to his site, the website was super busy, with Rom Hack projects everywhere. Granted, it was mostly ""changing sprites"" hacks, or alternate version hacks, but it was quite amazing what he was able to do. 

But for me, his website was too restrictive. He forced everyone to comment and post a specific number to be able to see the guides etc, which I thought was not fair. He also did not release his Pokemon Gold Hex to Text Table, which limited the people who were able to hack Pokemon in Korean. Only his closest could do it. So, I decided to create another Naver Cafe (Website) to counter his own. Me and some people were ""proficient"" Pokemon Rom Hackers compared to the rest, so people came over to our site to see all the guides and download our patches. We were also one of the few people who could change the title screen (I know, right? That was how low our skills were).

A few years later, I noticed that his website closed down. There were rumours that said it may be because our site took too many members from his site, or because of Nintendo Korea's intervention. Others said that it was because he was sick, so he could not continue with his site. What's kind of saddening is that after his site went down, the Korean Rom Hacking Scene virtually died; and I feel partially responsible.

And today, I heard from one of his site members that it was indeed that he was sick, and that he passed away last december. I was pretty shocked, because the situation was almost like a novel. It felt convoluted almost. How could something like this actually happen?

Well, that's why I decided to write this up to tell people about the Korean Rom Hacking scene and the guy who started it all! He posted so many guides, and they were all gone with his site. And it is quite saddening that he had to go like this. He also translated Japanese Games into Korean too.

I'll post some links to his hacks maybe!",,False,,t5_2t5aw,1376759609.0,,,True,t3_1kjvwv,http://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonROMhacks/comments/1kjvwv/story_of_virus_a_pokemon_rom_hacker/,

Brownie here with an important PSA!

Do you have a hack that you've been working on and want to share with the community? Or maybe you found something really interesting that we don't have on the [Community DropBox](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/opb8xcv4zrc8tgj/D34CQ8Dpj1). Well we have a method for making sure the patch and hacks are easily available to everyone! Here are the steps

1. The first thing you're going to do is send the patch to the DropBox Mod (that's me) via PM. If you don't know how to make a patch, send me the hacked ROM and I'll make a patch for you. It would be nice if you sent me the Base ROM information as well, so I know how to categorize it.

1. Then, I will post the patch on the Community DropBox so that everyone can easily access it.

1. Finally, I will send you the link to the patch on the DropBox so that you can make that self.post (or link to the DropBox to whore the karma).

When you do make your post, it might not be a bad idea to give the ROM and hack information. If you need an example, please see [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonROMhacks/comments/13g8zq/new_rom_hack_pokemon_tdt_the_darkest_timeline/) by PunsAreFun. This user was the first to post a hack via this method and it worked out great.

The Hack of The Month for the month of August is Pokemon Ash Grey! The game is a hack of FireRed by Metapod23, and follows the plot of the anime up to the Orange Islands. You play as Ash Ketchum, and follow the road to the Pokemon league and beyond: following the dreams of our favorite forever young protagonist. You know the story. You wake up late, and there aren’t any starters left! All that’s left is a Pikachu. And a world of adventure begins! This game is still updating! It currently boasts gameplay from 118 episodes and the first two movies! This game offers new maps, and the opportunities to catch all the same Pokémon that Ash does.

This is pretty easy but it can be time consuming depending on how many pokemon you want to add.  
**Things you will need**: GBA Rom, [YAPE](http://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?t=135173)(yet another pokemon editor), [Advanced sprite editor](http://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?t=196143) and **64x64** sprites of the pokemon you want to add.  
  
**Things to note before starting**:   
1) You can add some Pokemon without replacing others but giving them a pokedex entry is hard and not really worth it.  
2) You don't absolutely have to give them a shiny sprite but you need a front and back sprite.  
3) [Here](http://imgur.com/a/zrUCg#0) are some sprites from the IV and V generation(no shinies, sorry)
  
**Step 1**:  Open YAPE, load your rom and find the pokemon you wish to replace(if you want to add an entirely new one, use the ""?"" which are found after Celebi) and change its name. I will be replacing Skarmory with Druddigon.  
http://i.imgur.com/v0aX34W.png?1  

**Step 2**: Save and open Advanced Pokemon Sprite Editor. In this program, open your rom and  locate the Pokemon you just changed(Druddigon for me)  
http://i.imgur.com/0Gp4UbI.png

**Step 3**: Click ""edit"" and this will show up  
http://i.imgur.com/TWAWerT.png    
  
**Step 4**: Click ""import"" and load each sprite to its area(Or click ""import all"" if you have a sprite library)  
http://i.imgur.com/YXIlXZh.png  
  
**Step 5**: Click ""Synchronize Palettes"" and the sprites down will appear normal(hopefully). If they do(which they should), click ""ok"".  
http://i.imgur.com/MozC9kO.png  
  
**Step 6**: Click ""write to rom"" and this will appear  
http://imgur.com/BoaXKgs  

**Step 7**: Don't panic, this is very easy. Just click on ""find free space"" and then ""ok"". The sprite part has been done, now it's the easy but boring part.  
  
**Step 8**: Reopen your rom in YAPE and find your pokemon.You might have noticed that there are a ton of options regarding the  pokemon. These includes their average stats, moves they learn, abilities, growth rate, gender, pokedex entry(unless you chose ""?"" to add a new pokemon without replacing one), etc...   
If you need information on already existing pokemon, bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net is a great place to find information. 
Be sure to edit these the way you want and then save. We're done!

In Pokemon Canterbury (working title) you play the role of a young teenager recently relocated to the mining town of Foalgate. One day your mother sends you out to deliver lunch to your father in the mine, but on your way back your PokeNav starts ringing; whoever's on the other end sounds desperate, and asks you to locate a certain rock somewhere in the mine. Underneath this rock, you find a Poke Ball and a Pokedex, whereupon you're accosted by a mysterious young boy and forced into a battle. From there on, you're dragged into a journey across the country, collecting gym badges, catching Pokemon and getting caught up in a war between the criminal organization Team Moon, and Team Sun, a government division formed specifically to oppose them. Featuring a whole new storyline with a large amount of postgame content, a completely remade map and a huge variety of Pokemon, including 110 entirely new species, Pokemon Canterbury is... admittedly a very ambitious project, but I'm confident it can be done. Based off Fire Red and JPAN's engine hack.

**Backstory**

The 5 regions are still one (like Pangaea) and most of the land is not settled yet. Pokemon freely roam the land and only a certain few can tame them.

**Story**

You and your sister leave your small town of x (we don't have names yet) and leave to beat all 8 of the counts to claim their land. Once you have beaten the counts you go on to beat the elite four (four barons) and ultimately, the king.

**Features**

-Redesigned sprites for all of the Pokemon

-Armors to power up your Pokemon

-Assign stats yourself

That's all for now, but we might come up with more stuff later.

I'm working on this in hopes of creating a 386 patch for Emerald that also provides a decent challenge without resorting to something silly like the Elite Four being in the 90s.

Influenced by a round of VoltWhite, I'm opting to have improved Movesets and Attacks, as well as different Ability combinations on the various species available in the game, as well as beefing up the structures of all trainers teams. Team Magma Grunts, for example, now carry species such as Arcanine and Golem, instead of just Zubat and Mightyena, and rematch teams for Gym Leaders have taken on set ups similar in challenge to their PWT appearances in B2W2. Additionally (and seen on /r/Pokemon [recently](http://www.reddit.com/tb/1dv1zn)), I have included a few cameos from popular Nuzlocke runs, such as James from Death's Nuzlocke. Have fun finding them!

In the current patch, the majority of the 386 are available on one route or another. Handed out species such as Gen I starters and Eevee, as well as past Legendaries are not yet implemented, as I have yet to write events for them. Snorlax, however, has been given his own little event tucked away on a certain route.

The Safari Zone has been a wonderful example of small changes. Species such as Tauros and Vibrava have taken residence in the habitats. Additionally, all areas can be accessed upon your first visit - the guards that block off the Eastern two areas have been removed and a segment of terrain has been altered to allow you to bypass the obstacle preventing your current bike from moving forward. 

As for moves, Superpower and Bounce have replaced two relatively unused moves that the Battle Frontier Tutors taught . All starters have also had small changes to their Level up Movesets, to give them more flavor. Finally, thanks to the aid of PokeCommunity contributor DoesntKnowHowToPlay, I have been able to implement the Physical/Special split.

As far as bugs go, my tester has only found a graphical error with the bag sprites on the Poke Balls, TMs, and Berries screens resulting from repointing trainers. Nothing else has shown up.

**V1.0 TL;DR**

* Majority of 386 available

* More open Safari Zone

* Trainers from Littleroot to Ever Grande have been altered to present more variety and challenge

* A few species (mainly starters) have had Ability and Moveset alterations

* Cameos by 4 popular Nuzlockers

Thanks for taking the time to read and look at my work! I hope you all enjoy!

Included documentation for the patch includes Habitat Listings, and Important Trainer Rosters (beware - it reveals everything about their Pokemon!)

The 2 most useful things are the Excel workbook with the dozen or so spreadsheets and the big IDA database.  The database has 3500 of the functions Gamefreak coded labelled with descriptive names and most also have included return types and arguments.  It's pretty massive amount of work and was done entirely by me.  The .s files with the names that match the IDB files are text versions.  Use those if you don't have IDA.  Also there's a small NARC loader that's partially done and written in C in the script decompiler.  That might be useful to someone.

Fun fact for anyone still reading this: Gamefreak made a big mistake with Emerald, FR, and LG.  If you look on my pastebin, you'll see one called ""wait_for_vblank_bad_code"".  They don't put the CPU to ""sleep""(basically a very low-power waiting mode) while waiting for vdraw, so it cycles endlessly waiting for scanline number 160 to indicate vblank.  This cuts the battery life for Emerald, FR, and LG by 30-50%.  It also made the games a little bit laggy in places.  I patched the games to use the right software interrupt call(SWI 05) and framerates for basically everyone quadrupled in VBA and the occasional lagginess when switching areas and stuff went away.  I blame Gamefreak because they did it the right way in Ruby and Sapphire and the wrong way in all the other gen 3 games.  Someone didn't read all the documentation and didn't realize what they were doing by switching how they waited for vblank to occur.

1356140738.0,32,self.PokemonROMhacks,159cta,Pokemon 3rd Gen Reasonable Randomizer,42,10,40,http://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonROMhacks/comments/159cta/pokemon_3rd_gen_reasonable_randomizer/,"Hello r/PokemonROMhacks,

The [Reasonable Randomizer](http://code.google.com/p/pokemon-reasonable-randomizer/downloads/list) is a Java program that can modify the starter pokemon, wild pokemon, trainer pokemon and movesets of any pokemon game from the 3rd gen. It works with FireRed, LeafGreen, Emerald, Ruby and Sapphire, and with English, Japanese and French ROMs. The Reasonable Randomizer is different from other randomization programs in that it offers options for limited randomization, which means it won't simply pick any random pokemon from Bulbasaur to Deoxys, but instead limits the random pokemon to choose from based on factors such as evolution state, pokemon strength, pokemon habitat, and type specialties.

I've hosted the program on [Google Code](http://code.google.com/p/pokemon-reasonable-randomizer). I've also included the Java source code with the program, if anybody is interested in seeing it. [Here](http://i1196.photobucket.com/albums/aa401/Impiety0/UI_zps14106ba7.png) is a sneak peak at the user interface, for a visual explanation of what it does.

##Randomizer Features:

+  **Unevolved starters** - You have the option to make randomized starters unevolved. 

+  **Limit wild pokemon randomization based on strength** - this makes it so that every wild pokemon that is replaced has roughly the same strength as the pokemon that is replacing it. This means that it will be very unlikely to find pokemon like Groudon in Route 101 and pokemon like Weedle in Cerulean Cave.

+  **Limit wild pokemon randomization based on habitat** - this causes the randomizer to replace wild pokemon with pokemon that have the same habitat. Selecting this option means that you won't find, say, wild Blaziken while fishing, or wild Horsea in the middle of a cave. 

+  **Limit Trainer pokemon randomization based on strength** - this causes every trainer pokemon that is replaced to have roughly the same strength as the pokemon that is replacing it. It means that Youngster Joey won't end up with, say, a Ho-Oh, while Lance doesn't get pokemon like Rattata.

+  **Trainers retain type specialties** - choosing this option will cause type specialist trainers to only recieve pokemon that match their type specialty. For instance, Misty only gets Water pokemon, while Bug Catcher Holden only gets Bug pokemon. 

+  **Rival retains pokemon** - the rival's last pokemon will be kept constant throughout the game, except for when it evolves. 

+  **Rematch trainers retain their pokemon** - trainers that can rematch will keep the pokemon they originally used. The program keeps track of the evolutions as well, and can add new pokemon to the trainer's party.

+  **Trainer pokemon get randomized movesets** - the reasonable randomizer program doesn't pick completely random moves; it cobbles together random movesets from the pokemon's naturally learned moves, TM moves, egg moves, and tutor moves. You also have the option to use advanced movesets, which are predefined movesets that are strategically coherent. I basically used Battle Factory movesets for the advanced movesets, as well as Smogon for legendary pokemon.

The result of that work is the draft of the community hack you'll find below.
If you give it a quick look you'll notice there are several current ideas for the name and starter setup for the hack. It'd be great if you guys could choose your favorite option for both the starter selection and name and post it as a reply below.

Nothing is set in stone at the moment so if you disagree with anything or think you have a better idea shout it &gt;out in the comments. Now is also a great time to let us know if you want a hands on role helping to produce the hack. As we said before, there'll be plenty of opporunities for every subscriber to get involved but if you want to help call the shots or if you have a talent for mapping, scripting, spriting, or music let us know in your reply.

This version does NOT have the tilesets,  but generally the first gym and it's subsequent areas remain unchanged, apart from minor bug fixes and script changes.

General information about the hack:

* Hack of FireRed Version
* Play as a Rocket Grunt
* Start with Grimer, Ekans or Koffing
* Gyms are no longer gyms, but instead the final trainer battle in the assigned mission. In this case the stealing of the SECRET KEY as the first mission, and the stealing of the Fossils in MT MOON as the second. Missions will loosely follow the story of FireRed and Leafgreen, Heartgold and Soulsilver.
* Solely Gen 1 and Gen 2 Pokemon with New Sprites, both Gen 4/5 and Custom
* Able to 'steal' pokemon and items, cities may have interactable pokemon or items that will cause a wild battle with their owner, and subsequently your requisitioning of the item or pokemon.
* New item ""Glow stone"" - It evolves pokemon that would normally evolve in a trade.
* New tiles, mostly custom, based from HGSS maps
* Cosmetic day and night system that works off of VBA's RTC.

Things planned to be implemented:

* Physical/special split, and updated movesets with new moves.
* Different pokemon at Night.
* Season tilesets.
* OW's for Giovanni, and Officer Jenny.
* Completely updated sprites for every Pokemon and trainer.
* Vendors in Rocket Hideout that sell Pokemon, Eggs, TMs. (More items and pokemon will be unlocked after certain gyms have been completed)
* Custom trainer card.
* Certain routes and cities in Johto.
* Battle backgrounds to match the new tilesets.
* Hg/Ss intro screens for Mt. Moon, Rock Tunnel and various other landmarks.

---  
##Section One - Installing PGE and XSE
First let's download PGE. In the sidebar locate the link to the [Community DropBox](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/opb8xcv4zrc8tgj/D34CQ8Dpj1). Then navigate to Hacking Tools -&gt; PC -&gt; GBA -&gt; Pokemon_Game_Editor_Setup-1.0.0.0.msi

Download the file, run it, and accept the terms and conditions. You may wish to change the location where PGE is installed as you'll be visiting this directory later in the tutorial series. After you have chosen, click install then run PGE (labelled GBAPokemonGameEditor) from the Start menu.

After you run the program you'll be prompted to update it to the latest version, click yes. After this your [PGE window](http://i.imgur.com/2BFv8.png) should appear.

This window is where (most) of the tools used for GBA ROM hacking can be found. We'll start by exploring XSE. Cick on the XSE icon (second on the first row). You'll be [asked to install it](http://i.imgur.com/vz7e8.png), click yes and when the download is complete click on the XSE icon again to start the program.

---
##Section Two - Your First Script
Let's take a moment to consider what a script is. A script is a piece of code that executes when an event occurs in the game world to trigger it. An example of an event might be selecting which Pokemon to use at the start of a game, pressing 'A' next to a sign, or talking to a character. Now we have an idea of a what a script might be let's try and make a basic one of our own.

Every script starts with a similar line of code

    #dynamic 0xOFFSET

Where OFFSET is the location of the free space in the ROM you want to store the script. Think of a ROM like one big book where the scripts are the various paragraphs that make up the book. In this analogy, an offset would be the page and paragraph reference for where the script is stored. In Fire Red the offset 0x800000 is the first available free space so you'll see that particular offset used a lot.

Now we've got the first line out of the way let's see a short complete script and break it down line by line.

    #dynamic 0x800000
    #org @main
    lock
    faceplayer
    msgbox @spk1 0x6
    release
    end
    
    #org @spk1
    = Hello world!

**#dynamic** 0x800000 is the location of the free space this script will store itself in.

The **#org** pseudo-command is used to signify the start of a script, **@main** names this portion of the script 'main'. 

**lock** is used to lock the player in their position and unable to move. It's commonly used during dialogue to stop the player moving around while a character is talking.

**faceplayer** is used to make the NPC face the player while they talk.

The **msgbox** command is made up of two parts. The command 'msgbox' which is used to produce a message box and the @spk1 and 0x6 argument. An argument gives the command the information it needs to work. Think of it like a vending machine, it needs the specific number code for the chocolate you want as well as the money before you get your chocolate.

The @spk1 argument references the @spk1 portion of the script that contains the string of text we want to appear, in this case ""Hello world!"" **0x6** argument is used to signify which of the five types of text-box should be used.   

| Offset | Type of Box |
|:--: | :-- |
| 0x2| Normal message box with automatic lock, release, and face-player effects|
|0x3 | Used for signs |
|0x4 | Normal message box that does not close automatically. Works in conjunction with the **closeonkeypress** command |
|0x5 | Yes/No message box |
|0x6 | Normal message box |

The **release** command undoes the **lock** command and allows the player to move again.

The **end** command signifies the end of a script.

## Section 3 - Expanded Dialogue Techniques

Now you have the basic building blocks of a dialogue script. Let's cover some of the finer details.

In our previous example the text used was mostly very simple. There were no line-breaks, no special characters, colours, or stored variables such as a player name. If you want to use these things in a string things get slightly more complex. 

**\n** is used to produce a new line. For example

    #org @spk1
        = Hello world!\nI'm BHLHB3.

Would appear as

&gt;Hello world!  
&gt;I'm BHLHB3  

**\l** is also used for a new line but can only be used after \n has previously been used.  
**\p** is used to start a new text-box. 

**\h** is used in conjunction with a hex-code to insert a specific character such as the Pokedollar symbol.
**\c** is used in conjunction with a hex-code to colour specific text. 
**\v** is used in conjunction with a hex-code to recall stored text such as the player's name.

However instead of handling hex codes XSE has a simpler way of handling this. Hidden under the Tools menu is the [Text Adjuster](http://i.imgur.com/nH5DD.png). This can also be brought up using the short cut Ctrl+T.

The text adjuster automatically inputs the codes for line-breaks and new message boxes. A new line of text creates a new line and a line break produces a new text box. By right clicking anywhere in the text adjuster window you can produce a menu that includes the option to insert a number of [special character](http://i.imgur.com/cv7d7.png)s.

For those characters and other pieces of text that cannot be inserted through the special character tool XSE does have limited support for a number of 'short-codes' which save you using \h, \v, and also \c but do require the input of text. For example inputting [player] produces the player name instead of using \v\h01 and using [blue_fr] before a piece of text in Fire Red would produce a blue colour instead of using \c\h01\h08.

To find a list of these short-codes consult our [XSE short code reference](http://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonROMhacks/comments/vjgli/xse_codes/).

## Section 4 - Making Your First Script

Now we've covered the basics of dialogue we should be able to put together a dialogue script that:

* Stops the player from moving
* Forces the sprite that's talking to look at the player
* Contains multiple lines of dialogue
* Uses symbol such as the Pokedollar

Using the previous script as a template try producing a script where a character complains about the price of Super Potions at the local Pokemart and then follow the rest of the guide to produce a working in-game script.

After you've written your script -- it's good practise to check it works before compiling it (putting it into a ROM). To do this press the [debug button](http://i.imgur.com/aXl45.png), the fourth button in on the toolbar. If your script works, a window should pop up asking you to compile your script. Wait! You can't do that just yet. First you have to identify which offset you're going to use. Open up PGE, if it's not already open, and click on the button labelled FSF, the fourth along on the second row that looks like a magnifying glass.

This tool is called Free Space Finder (FSF) and is used to find offsets where you can insert data, such as scripts, in a ROM. Go to File -&gt; Open and open a *clean* Fire Red ROM, you may wish to make copies of your original ROM so that you always have a copy available. Then hit the find button, [this is an example output of all the free space available](http://i.imgur.com/wPzze.png).

Now go back to XSE and choose any of these offsets to be your dynamic offset at the start of your script. Once you have chosen an offset and have a working script it's time to compile. Click the first button on the toolbar and navigate to the ROM you just used with FSF. Once it is open press the third button on the toolbar to compile the script. The script is now stored in the ROM, but that doesn't mean it'll suddenly appear in the game. We need to place it there. 

Open PGE back up and you'll notice on the first row of icons 'Advance Map' appears twice, versions 1.92 and 1.95. Open up Advance Map 1.95, again you'll prompted to download and install it click yes and press the icon once again to open up the program.

The first thing you should do is head to:  Settings -&gt; 'Choose script editor'. [You'll be prompted to press yes or no](http://i.imgur.com/0wu7i.png), XSE can handle both these forms of commenting so either choice is fine.

Open the ROM your script is in by going to File -&gt; Load ROM or pressing Ctrl+O. [The sidebar will fill up with information](http://i.imgur.com/Gk2uf.png), stored maps. Open From Header -&gt; 3 -&gt; Pallet Town as this is where we want our script to occur. A picture of pallet town should appear in front of you but that's useless to us at the moment. Open the [events tab](http://i.imgur.com/uij8f.png) and click the [icon of the Ruby hero](http://i.imgur.com/Jad9g.png) to toggle showing sprites on the map.

Now we can see the sprites on the map we can locate the sprite we want to have our dialogue script, in our case the guy who talks about technology at the bottom of Pallet Town. Select him by clicking on him and you should see [this screen](http://i.imgur.com/hp9si.png). Take note the of the 'Script Offset' field, this is the script associated with the character -- this is what we want to change! Replace the guys script with the offset you chose at the start of your script, in my case this is 800000. Be wary of copy and pasting -- Advance Map pads the number, If you paste 800000 it'll appear as 800000**80**. Make sure to remove any extra digits.

Save your ROM using File -&gt; Save or Ctrl+S and load it up in an emulator to check your script.

**Backstory**


Anywho it is based in an alternate pokemon universe where Red/Ash never existed, therefore Giovanni's plans were never stopped in Mt. Moon, Game Corner, Pokemon Tower, &amp; Silph Co. allowing him to capture Mewtwo, and with mewtwo in his arsenal he easily beat the E4 and Lance. As the most powerful trainer in Kanto, with an army of henchman nonetheless, he began a hostile takeover of Kanto. Starting with replacing the elite four and brainwashing the gym leaders. And because Red was never there to compete and encourage Green/Gary, Green joined team Rocket and with his exceptional talent became Giovanni's right hand man.




Once Lance was beaten he returned to his home in Johto feeling more than helpless.




Two years later Giovanni has succesfully taken over the entire Kanto region and is attempting to invade Johto.






**Story**


You just turned ten years old and Lance is urging your mother, his cousin Clair, to allow you to go on a Pokemon journey because he sees great potential in you. And of course she reluctantly agrees. Lance then takes you to the dragon's den and allows you to choose your first pokemon either dratini, larvitar, or charmander. You then are sent off down route 45 to meet professor Elm to register as a pokemon trainer and recieve a pokedex. Elm gives you your pokedex, points you in the right direction and wishes you the best of luck. On your journey through Johto not much is different other than that you face many more members of team rocket, every pokemon is available to catch, and your rival isn't silver.... it's gold. Although the more you progress through Johto the more apparent team rocket becomes in each town. Until you stop team rocket at the Radio Tower, they then give up on taking over Johto for the time being. Though this is no easy feat, for it's your first encounter with Green. Oh and i forgot to mention team rocket is no longer filled with simple minded zubat carrying dunces, more like cold calculating diverse trainers with a lust for destruction. After you've acquired all eight badges you gain access to victory road. But you've also gained a name for yourself, what with singlehandedly stopping Team Rocket from taking over Johto. You are percieved as Kanto's last hope, and Giovanni's greatest threat. So Giovanni may as well have put a bounty on you and your pokemon's heads, because every team rocket member is desperate to defeat you and gain favor in the eyes of Giovanni. Still you cannot be defeated and enter the Indigo Plateau hoping to finally face Giovanni and end his reign of terror. After you've beat four of the toughest members of Team Rocket you expect to face Giovanni, instead you face Green who has taken his previous defeat personally and trained nonstop since to make sure your total annihilation is carried out.


Assuming you beat Green.... you finally gain access to Kanto and the entire region is in shambles due to team rocket shamelessly raping the country of it's goods and pokemon. But you can restore the country to it's once great glory. By defeating the gym leaders and reversing Giovanni's brainwashing techniques on them. After your victory over Giovanni's most trusted subjects, rumors start circulating that he has gone into hiding. Can you find him...?






**If this interests you**


If anyone is interested in helping me make this idea into an actual game, rom actually. Please let me know, because i cannot do this alone. I have started on several rom hacks before but could never complete them so i have some experience. I am best at scripting but am in no way a master, so any help will be appreciated so long as you are truly interested in helping and won't give up after a month. It will be done on a silver rom btw. And if anyone has suggestions for the story or even sees holes in mine feel free to bring them to my attention.

                      ===                                                                     ===

This project is aimed at making every included final stage Pokémon useful in at least one role even at the “End Game” in order to promote fair, more challenging, and diverse Trainer battles throughout the game without having to rely on overleveled, overpopulated Gym leaders with perfect coverage on the second Gym.

I intend to do this by:

* Standardizing and redistributing every included Pokemon's BST
* Raking through the movepools of every included Pokemon, adding where it's needed and taking away from those with a bit too much.
* Standardizing Moves themselves and the effects each type brings to bear
* Redistributing the better/more battle useful Abilities to more Pokemon
* Adding more Abilities in general.
* Type effectiveness changes. Rock needs dire help.
* Lastly, type additions/changes. There should be very few of these.


All this is just for the *Pokemon themselves.* This is the reason I've decided not include all six hundred and fifty pokemon. All of Gen I/II will be in, due to it being set in Kanto/Johto, but there will be liberal sprinklings of pokemon from other generations. 

The inclusion of later generation's pokemon and a preview of how the rebalancing will work can be seen from how Arbok and Seviper are planned to be handled. I'd like to further Arbok as a physical tank while making Seviper a special bulky counterpart with a new special version of Intimidate. I'm even leaning toward both evolving from Ekans and having a split evolution line like the Hitmon family. Of course, with Seviper in his best buddy Zangoose is in too.

What I don't want to do is give every Pokemon Multiscale and Draco Meteor. Increasing weaker Pokemon's BST and expanding their movepools to where they can compete with each other as equally as possible is the way I'm going to go about it. If the Pokemon is totally devoid of any character, or if it could be useful to contrast it with another Pokemon of the same typing and ""animal"" type I'll do so, like the above example. I hope that making *every* Pokemon competitive will make up for the loss of a good number of them.


                      ===                                                                     ===


That only covers the battling aspect of Pokemon. But with the ease of creation RMXP allows, I plan on making a reverse HG/SS with both regions being expanded with locations from both the anime and manga. It easily allows me to make important NPCs more active with inside the story, such as having Brock helping you at Mount Moon. I intend for all the important NPCs to help/show/attack when there's story events that could benefit from including them.

One NPC that's safe to talk about is your Mother(is a wildebeest). In all of the games she exists to give you a few things and heal your Pokemon. In PR:PR, the PC's mother owns a small berry farm on Route 1 and sells the produce to Oak(who like all natural things for his private reservation) and the leftovers to Viridian City. But if you make it big as a trainer, we know the pokebucks just roll in. What better place to spend them? Of course, your mother will need help on said farm when you leave and if expanded, so you'll be asked to catch (docile)Pokemon for her. Oak will ask you to catch specimens for him too, as Blue will invest him his grandfather though the game.

That's enough of me prattling have some (rough)images and a huge info dump.

There have been a few rule changes recently that we haven’t had a chance to share with you yet.

The first change is that  we’ve now relaxed the rules on **RPGMaker games**. The only restriction on their posting is that any posts specific to RPG Maker XP such as RPG Maker must be tagged with [RPGMXP]. So posts that have to do with maps and shit, those don’t need the tag. The ones that have to do with scripting or other RPG Maker XP processes, those do.

The second isn’t a specific change but rather a clarification. Questions along the lines of “How do I play a ROM Hack herp?”, “OMG iz there a gme wth Pikachu derp??”, or any other variation of a Q&amp;A style question which can be answered by either the Hackdex or the ROM Hacks 101 guide will be removed. Even though those have gone down in number (thanks to these guides) they still make us cringe and want to delete, approve, and delete again. Because they suck *that* much.

However submissions along the lines of “Which ROM hack has the best story?”, “Which ROM hack has the best atmosphere?”, and any other questions which provoke discussion are exempt. The only exception being “Which ROM hack is the best?!” Come on guys, it’s been asked more than enough. Yeah it’s productive, but it’s kinda a crappy question if you see it once a week on average.

If there are any posts that violate any of the rules, please report them so that they may be removed. We want to keep this subreddit as spam-free and as productive as possible. So, if you need any clarification on the rules drop the team a message through the mod mail.

Ok, now onto the fun stuff!

* **Hackdex v3.0** is coming soon guys! This will be the second ‘complete’ incarnation of the Hackdex with DropBox links, info tags, and pictures where applicable.
* The **Hack of the Week** is gone...for now. We’re working on bringing it back but with a few tweaks and updates.
* Be on the lookout for news regarding the **community hack** that **you**, that’s right you, voted on! There has been progress and we want to share it with the people that made it possible!

I made a Pokemon Leaf Green mod which essentially makes the game much more balanced and fun to play yourself.

Some key points:  All fully evolved pokemon all have around 560-600 total base stats so that more pokemon are actually viable, pokemon from all 3 generations can be caught or attained in the game, changed some moves around to further balance pokemon, gym leaders are more challenging, the Elite 4 are really difficult, and TMs can found on wild pokemon.

While this does not add any actual content, I feel that it greatly enhances the game, and makes it more challenging and fun.  This still look many hours to create.

My goal with this is to encourage build diversity, instead of being pigeon holed into getting the same pokemon every game because they are objectively better than others.

1342959718.0,25,self.PokemonROMhacks,wyqby,[Tutorial] How do I start ROM hacking? Which ROM base do I use? ,28,3,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonROMhacks/comments/wyqby/tutorial_how_do_i_start_rom_hacking_which_rom/,"I don't claim to be an expert however there have been quite a few questions about starting a ROM hack so I thought I'd share what I know.

---
#How much do I know?
ROM hacking isn't an easy process -- unless you have a very specific goal, such as removing a Pokémon or adding a specific item, it's an eclectic process - there are lot of little bits you need to know. The best way to learn all those bits is to grab a copy of a ROM and dive in to a mapping or scripting tutorial until you think you're ready to move on to the big game. I recommend the XSE scripting tutorials in the sidebar as a starting point.

---
#Do I have time to invest in this hack?
The truth is very few hacks make it to completion. I'd say 10-20% of hacks release a BETA or ALPHA version and maybe 5% make it into a stage where a game is playable. Even less games actually ever end up 'finished'.

You can expect your hack to take you anywhere from a Summer (for minor trainer teams, sprite changes, or dialogue changes) to three years. Expect longer if you are doing it solo or you lack the necessary knowledge and are learning as you go along.

Big stumbling blocks and time consuming features are using custom tiles, inserting new Pokémon, adding new regions, and creating games with multiple paths.

If you don't feel like you have a lot of time to invest in making your own hack, consider joining a team and contributing to a group project.

---
#Choosing a generation and ROM base
So you've decided you want to make a hack? You need to decide which generation and specifically which game version you want to use.

Generation I (R/B/Y) and II (G/S/C) hacking is 'old skool' at this point in time, and a little more complex than generation III due to the lack of tools. That said there's great resources over at the [Skeetendo forums](http://hax.iimarck.us/) and we generally know the most about this generation.

Generation III (R/S/E + FR/LG) is by far the most popular generation to hack due to the large tool pool and the ease of entry. The three main ROM bases for generation III are Fire Red, Ruby, and Emerald in order of popularity -- LG and Sapphire are rarely used for hacks. 

The most notable distinction between the three is the resources available. Fire Red has a larger amount of documentation and consequently hacking it is easier. It also improves, in areas, on the implementation of certain features in Ruby. Emerald can be considered the most advanced of the three versions however it also contains the least documentation of the three and its architecture differs from both Ruby and Fire Red making working with it slightly harder. Both Ruby and Fire Red have ongoing 649 patches and Fire Red has a hacked game engine available.

Ruby and Emerald have a greater variety of sound effects, differing bikes,  Pokémon contests, and Secret Bases. Emerald exclusively has the Battle Frontier and also contains battle animations. Also worth noting are the interface differences between the versions -- the bag system (e.g. the use of a TM case in FR), the Pokédex, the inclusion of a Pokénav in Ruby and Emerald, the Teachy TV in FR, and the 'Previously...' screen in FR.

The final difference I'd note is the Real-Time Clock (RTC). Ruby and Emerald cartridges have an inbuilt chip which records the passing of time for events such as berry growth and tides. Certain emulators mimic this but some do not -- using Ruby or Emerald as your ROM base will restrict your user base. There is also a RTC patch for Fire Red but it is not a feature native to the ROM.

#Do you run Windows?
The vast majority of tools are designed to run on a Windows machine. If you are running on a Mac then look into using Bootcamp or VirtualBox to run a copy of Windows to hack with.

---
#What tools are these?
Most of the useful tools listed here can be found the community DropBox.

For all generations I recommend Hex Workshop and [agentgeo's Pointer Calculator](http://www.mediafire.com/download.php?3k8w86wyaqv3kex)

For generation I hacking, I recommend [Swampert's tools](http://hax.iimarck.us/topic/784/), [stag019's Gen I graphic compressor](http://romendo.net/stag019/pokedex/reverse.php), and for the brave [Lin's GB Assembler Plus](http://hax.iimarck.us/topic/1595/).

For generation III hacking I recommend [GBA Pokémon Game Editor](https://www.dropbox.com/s/cvr7b516s192usn/Pokemon_Game_Editor_Setup-1.0.0.0.msi), Sappy, [YAPE](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/v6laikvlbvabbvp/tx9QSpfVXj), [Adv.

I am deciding whether custom events are added or the event items are given to you alongside the S.S Ticket.

Progress:
- Items : 90%
- Location Names : 100%
- Trainer names : 100%
- NPC and Signs : 1%
- Pokémon Locations : 0%
- Trainer Teams : 0.001%

Future Aims : 
- Custom Maps
- Custom Trainers (May take requests)
- Gen 4/5 Pokémon (Debating)
- Newer Sprites (Will choose/poll the best sprite out of gens 3-5)

Possible Features:
- Johto (Will need a lot of attention.)
- Kanto (Will use Pokémon locations of HG/SS, maps of FR/LG)
- Mirage Island Simulator (Wynaut?)
- Custom Sprites (Joey HD)
- Always open Hideout (So you don't have to wait 24 hours to play lottery to get the master ball)

Anyways this story could explain what the war is about, who is fighting who, how pokemon were used during the war, have towns destroyed, make it very apocalyptic, introduce characters that die in the storyline. 

There are a million ways you could take this story just one i thought up off was you start off as someone who is 21, freshly drafted into the war and given a choice of receiving three different sets of pokes, each set containing X amount of pokemon. Personally i dont think it wouldn't be viable to go out into the wild to catch pokes so acquiring new pokes would be based on the set you're given in the beginning and stealing them off the corpses of your enemy's (when this is done the stolen poke will hate you and often disobey, but eventually will give in to liking you) You quickly rise through the ranks of the army and are trusted with capturing legendary pokemon X because with it's power you'd surly win the war.

2. You can now buy any berry in any town from a specialized person standing in the town who will sell you any berry. 

3. Some color changes: various red outfits are changed to blue.

4. A few character cameos from Gen V, like N and Bianca.

5. More? Possibly. I haven't played through the whole game yet, so I'll see.

I'm here to say, it's been fixed! The new version, located in the Hackdex, and [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/5wmfizpzw43inz8/PokemonTDT.ips) is the new version of TDT without this bug.

I'm aware of the bug that happens after beating the Quad Core and have 0 idea how to fix it, sadly. So short of any new bugs that arise this is the final update for TDT.

It's a plus if it feels pretty polished, as that is something I've enjoyed on this hack.

TRAINERS

* All Trainers have different Pokémon. There are even new Trainer Classes in the game, for example Picnickers or Campers (check out the screenshots)!

* Several other trainers got their sprites improved!

WILD POKéMON

* About all Pokémon can be caught, from Generation I to V!

EVOLUTION

* There's no more need to trade your Pokémon to make them evolve!

* Please take a look at the list of 'new evolution methods' below.

DIFFICULTY

* This deluxe version is more difficult - can you keep up in this fast-paced Pokémon game?

* It won't be too hard, but you'll need more strategy to win battles!

GYM LEADERS

* Some already known Gym Leaders, including the Rock-type Gymleader Brock, have traveled all their way to the Unova Region! What's their purpose?

* And who are the other special trainers who have temporary settled in Unova?

* On top of that, prepare to battle Cilan, Chili and Cress in a Triple Battle!

CHAMPION

* Who is this Champion everyone's talking about in Unova?

* And who's this mystic Trainer in Undella, enjoying the view of the calm and wonderful sea at Undella Bay?

POKéMON EDITS?

* This game contains NO edited Pokémon; this means: no edited Pokémon types, no edited basestats, no edited movesets, no edited move types, no edited ... And so on. 

*  This means the basic Pokémon experience remains!

With BW2 around the corner, it is likely that the ROM hack will not be continued much further than it currently is. In the most recent version, you can get all 8 Unova badges and challenge the Elite Four -- essentially it stops right before the after-game phase.

Anyway, I wanted to tell you about this new and awesome script generator I am currently programming to allow newbies to the scripting scene make rather basic scripts but still allows you to make detailed scripts. 

The engine is known as ""Nekos' Pokémon Script Generator"" it is still being programmed and it allows you to create scripts for FireRed, LeafGreen, Ruby and Sapphire, I am hoping to add Emerald in the future, but I don't see many hacks of Emerald so I will do that later on.

The engine features many items that will allow you to script. It offers unlimited classes, the ability to remove classes that you have made. Able to add simple code into the system with the touch of a few buttons. Currently there are 46 commands that you can do, each will have a detailed piece of information to help you understand what it will do. There are 3 pages of events, on page 1 I have put the basic commands that you will likely use:
* Show Text
* Apply Movement
* Give Pokémon
* Give Item
* Set / Check Flags

This will only generate the script and **NOT** import it into the rom you are hacking. This is simply a generator. You will need to use a compiler such as XSE to compile the script. **But** there is going to be a button that will; 1. Download XSE into the folder (if not set) and 2. Able to open the rom and then transfer the script to XSE to compile.

This script generator is part of my Nekos' Pokémon Toolkit which currently contains two tools:
Pokémon Script Generator (For Hacks)
Pokémon Essentials Toolkit (For RMXP Pokémon Essential Games)

1372478088.0,24,self.PokemonROMhacks,1hakn6,Pokemon Generation 0. working idea/title.,24,0,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonROMhacks/comments/1hakn6/pokemon_generation_0_working_ideatitle/,"I figured I'd post this on here (after giving away my idea in another post), and I apologize if it's an idea that's already been done, and please tell me if it is (I haven't hacked in 9 years, and the amount of completed hacks has grown exponentially since then).

Anyway - 

POKEMON GENERATION 0 (another working title is Pokemon Grey or Pokemon Amethyst (a hack that I started back in the day but never finished)

Setting: 12 years before Pokemon Red Blue and Green during the implied 'Pokemon War'

Characters: Red and Blue's fathers (as they're not seen in R/B/G/Y and I'm assuming they've been implied as dead along with the huge absence of middle-aged adults in the games). I was thinking of using last names (although I'd have to think of one for Red's father), so it would be OAK and (whatever. Still thinking of a name here) and then as you go throughout the game, the title could change, for instance Private OAK to begin with and then by the end General OAK or something like that.

Locations: I'd like to incorporate as many (canonical) regions as possible but not allow all 600+ pokemon to be seen/caught. I also don't want to do every region in its entirety but instead have certain cities/areas available as well as certain areas that were unavailable in each generation (example being maybe a battle atop Mt.Moon as well as inside of it). I also want to do different versions of the cities we all know, especially Vermilion City, Cinnabar (more on this later), and Pallet town, which I feel like should have been much larger towns given their port access (so maybe, especially with Vermilion, I could have it on fire or something which could explain why there's a huge construction site in the middle of the city in R/B/Y/G) This leads into the next area-

Pokedex: Instead of the Pokedex, I'd like Prof. Oak (maybe not even a professor at this point in time) to give the main characters a 'Log Book' of sorts that would act like a Pokedex, but would imply that much of the information that went into the first Pokedex was gathered by the protagonists.

Badges: Instead of badges, I think it'd be better to have 'ranks' like in the army given to the player after certain points in the story.

Starters/Pokemon: I'd like the starters to be 'combat-trained' versions of whatever starters I decide to use (haven't decided on exact pokemon). This would basically be, for example, like a Pikachu with a beret on and would have a better attack set / stats than a regular Pikachu. You would still be able to catch regular pokemon and train them, but at certain points in the story you could obtain certain 'combat-trained' versions of Pokemon.

As far as catch-able Pokemon go, I'd like to give the player a limited resource on Pokeballs so that they need to choose wisely which Pokemon are worth catching. I'd also like (in the spirit of Pokemon Naranja) to make the types set up in a way (obtainable pkmn vs what you're fighting) as to make it difficult to finish the game. Example here could be that I would like, if I decide to make the starter an electric Pokemon, to pick types that are difficult to kill by electric type Pokemon and continue that trend until by the end it will be important to have a very well rounded team.

Battles: I'd like to incorporate more double battles to encourage building a diverse team (there will still be plenty of singles battles), and especially during the 'battles' (here I'm talking about a battle that would happen in a war) I want there to be another level of difficulty added by making the amount of battles one has to endure in between healing opportunities to be larger. Another way of putting it: During some of the sequences, I want the player to be frustrated that he's run out of PP on 3 of his pokemon, 2 of them are fainted, and now he can't get to a PKMN Center (which will probably be more like a 'med center/tent' in the game) but still has to battle 2 'soldiers' (instead of trainers).

Cinnabar and the 'Mew Files': One of the main plot points in the game I want to incorperate is to have the final sequence (instead of the Elite 4) to be something like a battle with some tough 'government officials' or something like that in an effort to free Mew from the 'Burnt out Manor' (which won't be burnt out at this point, but will instead be a secret lab kept by the gov't). I was also thinking that Cinnabar could be the main 'military base' of Kanto. Although I haven't decided on the fate of the protagonists, I'd like the end goal to be the rescue of Mew and to perhaps end in an escape from the manor as it burns (which was set by a younger Giovanni who either holds a position in the government or is 'secret service'. Haven't decided yet).

Anyway, sorry if that sort of rambled, but let me know what you think. It's still in very baby stages as I'm still getting used to the tools and still planning out a lot of stuff (haven't hacked in 9 years, and that amount of time takes a toll on general knowledge, but it's been a pretty smooth transition so far.)",,False,,t5_2t5aw,1372485803.0,,,True,t3_1hakn6,http://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonROMhacks/comments/1hakn6/pokemon_generation_0_working_ideatitle/,

After [last week’s mod post by](http://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonROMhacks/comments/vbyux/announcement_rpokemonromhackers_lets_talk_hotw/) we’re now annoucing the start of the /r/PokemonROMhacks community hack.

**How do I get involved?**   
The first step is to figure out which direction the community wants the hack to take. We want to grab some info about what **YOU** would like to see in the hack.  To do this we’d love you take a look at the questions below and post a reply with your answers.

As a little incentive, popular ideas (supported by upvotes) for this project will be rewarded by unique flairs only available through participation in the community hack project!

Please take some time to answer the following questions, upvote any replies you agree with, and reply to them commenting on which particular aspects you agree with.

&gt;* Which of the following is your most preferred ROM base?
&gt;    * FireRed
&gt;    * Emerald
&gt;    * Ruby
&gt;* Which of the following is your most preferred tile set?
&gt;    * FireRed
&gt;    * Emerald
&gt;    * Ruby
&gt;* Featured Legendaries
&gt;* Should we include Fakemon? **If yes**, should we have:
&gt;    *  A full fakedex?
&gt;    * Just a couple Pokémon?
&gt;    * Only pre/post Evolutions for existing Pokémon?
&gt;* What difficulty level should the ROM hack be?
&gt;    * The same as the original Pokemon game
&gt;    * Hard but by not avoiding trainer battles or fleeing from wild Pokemon most players will not struggle with gym leaders
&gt;    * Gyms and other main trainers may require specific Pokemon, strategies, or grinding to be able to be beaten
&gt;
&gt;* Do you have any suggestions for starter types match up?
&gt;* Do you have any plot ideas you would like to see implemented?
&gt;* Are there any specific features that you liked in other hacks that you would like to see in this hack?
&gt;* Do you have any other general comments or suggestions for the hack?


**Naming the Hack**

This is intended to be a method of fixing some of the issues introduced when playing Pokemon Emerald on a PC. It should also help in reducing frustration by enhancing certain aspects of the game. The ""hack"" will be quite similar to what Pokemon Volt White and Blaze Black did for BW.

The big issue I'm having right now is how to increase or otherwise change the rate at which Shiny Pokemon pop up. I've looked everywhere but have not been able to find a guide, and I'm not sure what would code for Shiny Pokemon rates anyways. Can anyone please help?

EDIT: Since people might be curious, the game will include:

* Legitimate ways of obtaining all Pokemon, even Legendary Pokemon.

* Earlier access to the National Dex.

* Redundant Sun / Water / Thunder Stones so every Pokemon can be evolved.

* Wild and Enemy Pokemon will have a much harder level curve.

* Wild and Enemy Pokemon will be smarter in how they use their moves.

* TMs can be used multiple times like in BW.

* The items found throughout the game will be changed to decrease frustration.

* The game can be made into a Nuzlocke or Randomizer challenge through in-game settings.

* The Pokemon sets of some trainers will be changed for greater difficulty.

* Individual Pokemon might have their stats and (rarely) their typing changed for balance reasons.

* Individual moves might have their power and (rarely) their typing changed for balance reasons.

* Some wild Pokemon locations will have been moved around to fit all 386 Pokemon in the game.

* Pokemon that evolved by Trading or Clock Time will be given new evolution methods.

* Pokerus will be slightly more common among wild pokemon.

* Shiny status should be more common among wild pokemon.

* After completing the National Dex, you will receive an item that will further increase your odds of finding Shiny Pokemon, the Shiny Badge will greatly increase your enjoyment of the game.",,False,,t5_2t5aw,1369798395.0,,,True,t3_1f8fc2,http://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonROMhacks/comments/1f8fc2/any_way_to_make_shiny_pokemon_more_common/,

Hi! It seems you've come across my hacked version of Pokemon fire red.
So if you bought this from someone, get your money back cause the games free!

But yes, what did you say your name was again?""

-WUBS (fire)
-SLED(water)
-???(grass)

""Ahh! I remember now. Yes...
Player, this is a Pokemon (eevee). Pokemon can be your best friend, your partner,your target, or your slave. Depending on what of path you choose. There was this story on the news of a group of renegades who are actually murdering innocent Pokemon! I don't like what this world is coming to. It truly is depressing...
I'm sorry, I'm getting distracted again.
Player, prepare to journey off on an epic adventure that will test your strength, mind, and love for Pokemon!""

Come see me in my lab...

Player starts in his room. If you try to exit, your mother will shout and a text box will say ""you have to go to bed right now. You don't wanna be late to such an important day""
Player interacts with his bed and chooses ""yes"" to fall asleep

Shows sprite surrounded in complete darkness, suddenly 4 white flames appear around the player and slowly start to circle. As the flames begin to turn blood red and circle around the player faster, a white spotlight like beam of light pierces the darkness and shows a sprite of darkrai, the nightmare pokemon, fixed towards the player. Suddenly you hear the ghost pokemons cry and at that same instant the darkness surrounding you flashes with fiery reds and oranges and character falls into darkness below him.

When the player lands, his sprite is changed to misdrevous. As the player realizes what he looks like a text box shows up ""!!!"" The player runs back and forth quickly as if scared. Player now controls sprite to walk up a very long dark hallway. half way through music fades in slowly and the tint slowly turns from black to red. The music Is distorted and backwards. At the end of the hall, once again a flash of white

When the player wakes. He is shocked by a wild misdrevous at his bedside. The misdrevous joins your party and you head to prof Lewis lab...

Were expecting to be finished by summer. If you have any input or good ideas or just wanna connect with wubs and I. Just like the Pokemon hollow Facebook page.

There will be quests, guilds, and dungeons to explore/clear. Evolution stones can be mined for, etc. badges still exist obviously, but with gyms being more like working up to challenging a guild leader.

Here is the download link:
https://www.dropbox.com/s/sz6oacx1zvay9fi/Pokemon%20Apollo%20BETA%200.3.rar

For all the information you need please consult the readme.

I would make this post more detailed, but after releasing a few things earlier I figured most people know about it by now. But if anyone has any burning questions the readme should answer it, if not feel free to ask them in this thread!

Disclaimer: As this is a BETA there are unfortunately a few bugs, none are game breaking at all! They are mostly little palette problems here and there. However if you do find any bugs that are not listed in the readme, tell me about them and I'll do my best to fix them. If you also know how to fix any of the listed bugs tell me about them!

Next release: I'm being quite ambitious with what I hope to include with the next release, while all the releases up to now have included a decent amount of content, now with many features such as moves, tilesets and sprites basically completed the next release will feature a lot of content. As such it'll likely take about a month or so to release it!

Thanks a lot and I hope you enjoy it!

A game played from the Rival's perspective. No new routes, no new trainers, no new pokemon, just a (slightly) different storyline and different times to have Rival encounters.

Primary idea would be to play as Gary/Blue in FireRed, as it's the most commonly hacked ROM I've seen. You'd choose which pokemon your rival picked up, so as to get the one you want, battle Team Rocket but not be strong enough to drive Giovanni out of Silph Co, then battle Red when leaving... Beat Lance, become champion, then Red shows up and you battle it out for the title. You'd even start out in the house on the right of Pallet Town. Small details like that as well as major ones.

Anybody think this is a good idea? And more importantly, would anyone like to make it?

As I [said last time,](http://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonROMhacks/comments/1e2gra/after_toying_with_various_editors_and_tools_for_a/) I was out to make a slightly more modern, more difficult 386 patch for Emerald. With the first patch, I was able to enhance almost every Route, Cave, and Water Source between Littleroot and Ever Grande, including the trainers within them. This time, my patch took a more battle intensive approach:

* Majority of 386 now have changes to Abilities, Movesets, and Stats

* Certain moves have had power, accuracy, or usage boosts

* Trade evolutions have been replaced with either Personality value (Clamperl evolves kinda like Wurmple now) or Happiness mechanics (a happy Onix is a soon to be Steelix)

* The Physical Special Split is now perfected (hopefully!) thanks to DoesntKnowHowToPlay, so the few errors witi Counter, Rough Skin, and Focus Punch should be eliminated

* Eevee is now hiding out on a relaxing route!

As with before, there is documentation on the available species per area and important trainer changes. However, given the nature of this update, there is now a listing of all Species and move changes made since then.

Though there are many exciting points, there are still a few boring a lame errors still remaining:

* Bag sprites are now all just a scrambled, wibbly wobbly mess

* Bounce and Superpower, for whatever reason, refuse to show up in the Move Tutor's list; instead, Endure and Swift (respectively) still take their place in the list, while Mega Punch is offered as the tutorable move. Annoying indeed.

As always, the download link is [right here.](https://www.dropbox.com/s/401ttobqfguza7w/Eccentric%20Emerald%20V1.1.zip)

**First** and foremost, this is not possible unless your iPhone is jailbroken.  There are different ways to jailbreak it, but I used Evasi0n.  You can go to their website to find out how to perform the jailbreak.

Once your iDevice is jailbroken, go onto Cydia &lt; Search and look for GPSPhone.  This is a gameboy advance emulator and will allow you to play Gameboy Color and Gameboy Advance Roms.  This is pretty much your console.

Once you have your GPSPhone app, you will want to download iFile from Cydia as well.  iFile is a file manager and will allow you to locate and move the Roms once they are downloaded into your iDevice.  

**ROMS**
Now to the semi-difficult part.
What you're going to want to do is Google whatever ROM you wish to play.  (Look in Cydia prior to Google because Cydia has a majority of Pokemon Games already available and will save you the tedious process)  If you would like to play Fire Red,  you should Google ""Pokemon Fire Red Rom"" and see the listings.  (**NOTE** You can skip the whole unzipping process i will mention soon if you google a .gba file instead of a ROM, ie; pokemon fire red.gba; and also *cough* 4Shared *cough* is a great place to get these Roms)  Once you have the site, download the ROM.  

Once you have the ROM file downloaded, you need to move it into the ROM Folder. **if you downloaded a .gba file instead of a rom, scroll down because you have no need to unzip the file**  Open iFile and go all the way to the first page of your system folders.  
proceed to go to   var &lt; mobile &lt; documents.
Majority of the time, your downloads should be here if you scroll down.  If you have a ROM, click the ROM and click ""ZIP Viewer""  and click the .gba file and once its checked click the icon on the bottom right corner of the screen and click ""Extract File""  This will make the .gba file appear in the ""Documents""folder that the ROM is in.  **Those who had a .gba file to begin with, start reading here**  Now you want to click ""Edit"" in the top right hand corner of the screen and then click the .gba file and when the red check mark appears next to it click the Clipboard icon on the bottom right of the screen and select CUT.  Now click done on the top right hand corner.
    

On the top left hand corner click Mobile and scroll down and open a folder titled ""Media.""   In that folder you should see another folder titled ""ROMS"" and in that folder another titled ""GBA.""  Click that folder and click EDIT at the top right hand corner of the screen and click on the clipboard icon and press PASTE.  Congrats, your .gba file is now in the ROM folder and is now playable. 
     
Open GPSPhone and under ""Browse"" select the game you would like to play.

General information:
Hack of Pokemon FireRed wherein you can play as Team Rocket.
Follow a set of missions that replace the conventional gym challenges, following roughly the Team Rocket events from Kanto and Johto. The difficulty is noticeably harder than Firered, don't worry this is deliberate, if life was easy for Team Rocket, would Red have beaten them? But if at time it is too extreme, it is subject to change.

Read the readme attached with the IPS file for more information!

Enjoy fellow Romhackers!

----

As this is a BETA I would like advice in terms of: 
Difficulty, glitches, ways to improve.
Please read the readme before posting a glitch, as there are already a few known glitches that do not impede the gameplay experience. 
Except for one, which is especially specific.
Additionally, if there are any of this glitches that any of you know how to fix, it would be helpful if you informed me of the solution to them!

There are two versions, one is just Firered with sprites changed, one has other changes including making all Pokemon obtainable in the wild and slightly changing gym leader teams (Koga no longer uses three of the same Pokemon and Sabrina doesn't have a bug type for no reason).

I am 360RPGplayer. My main pokemon alias is [ChickoritaMudkipz](http://www.youtube.com/ChikoritaMudkipz) and I have been hacking for the better part of 3 years or so.

I've been a top contributer on the subreddit for  around6 months and I have written a handful of hacking tutorials in the past.

My main hack right now is [Pokemon Olive Green](http://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?t=283477). I've also worked on other hacks, such as this [one](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRkFFGIimFM) but I seem to lack the ability to finish things.

However, this is why writing tutorials seems to fit me well, that way I can pass my knowledge on and hopefully some amazing hacks can be created.

I am also in charge of updating the hackdex, which I will make a point in doing once a week or so. This way, if you are ever bored and are interested in playing a hack, checking the hack dex will hopefully be the best way of doing so without having to sift through the pokecommunity.

Anyway, if you're working on a hack and are having trouble with just about anything, feel free to personally pm me, I will personally assist anyone with any XSE scripts or other things they may be having difficulty with.

I look forward to getting this community to be one of the largest rom hacking forums on the interwebz.

Team Rocket in particular. That's when you head to Hoenn (or Sinnoh).

Team Rocket (or another Team, I don't care) steals you're Pokemon. A nice bystander sees it happen and presents you with a new starter Pokemon. You then travel through the next two regions looking for Team Rocket trying to get you're Pokemon back.

After beating the Sinnoh Elite four you still can't get them back from Team Rocket, so you get on a plane to Unova fearing the worst. You start noticing the strange signs that Team Rocket is there (People complaining about stolen their stolen Pokemon, Rocket members running out of rooms just as you enter, other little things). You confront Team Rocket with your new beloved Pokemon, but as you beat them you are presented with a choice.

A terrible choice. One of the members sneakily hit you from behind nd while you were unconscious took your current team. You awake to find both of your teams other sides of the room each guarded by one Rocket member. You know you'll only have the chance to get one of your teams before having to grab a parachute and escaping. Which will you choose?

As a side note after beating Unova you may happily continue to search for your other team.

Reccomendation: 10/10, A must-play Pokemon ROM Hack.

The story starts with what most hacks begin on. A young boy/girl growing up to be a trainer in a new region, but this starts off a bit different. 

First the protagonist which I shall refer as he, wishes to become a Guardian Trainer, trainers which command, have bonded and ultimately protect the Legendary Pokemon, Guardians Pokemon which take roles in the past game ""Ruby Destiny"" Games.

She runs into problems with his childhood friend, as an old woman running away from the evil and quite literal- ""Dark Organization"", the old woman asks for help and lets the hero and his friend use her Pokemon. 

Time passes.

The Hero seeks to become a ""Guardian Trainer"" and now he must challenge the Eight Elemental Masters and ultimately challenge the Pokemon League, but shadows reign over the region Hevah as the Dark Organazation, and something much, much darker awakens....



Scripting: 

One of the most scripted ROM Hacks I've ever played, for god's sake, you can chose the path of good, evil and neutral at a point in the game, the scenes are amazing, the scripting I simply can't put it into words. 

10/10



Storyline:

Probably, and possibly the best storyline of any Pokemon ROM Hack, with its powerful scripting events you'll get stuck playing the game wondering what will happen next, it's large set of rivals, the Guardians and their emotional turmoils against the Dark Organazation becomes visible and trust me, as my friend said. ""You'll feel stuff playing this.""

10/10



Setting:

The Fake Pokemon became worrying, but I soon grew fond of them as my challengers used them against me and I fought on; the atmosphere of the Henova Region is one of the well-most made regions I've seen. You won't be disappointed as you will soon wish for Nintendo to make a game out of the Henova Region.

10/10



Sprites: 

The Fake Pokemon became favorite Pokemons as the amazing story backed by the grand scripting and their sprites looked better every passing second. The Fourth and Fifth Generation Pokemon also looked extrordinary, average trainers got new-incredible sprites. But some gym leaders and story characters have some sprites borrowed from other games. But that's the only downfall, and even those sprites look great. 

9/10



Music: 

A somewhat of a dissapointment for such a game, but for some reason as I kept playing on I found the music to become more attracting, as I started to enjoy the battles and the music. But sometimes it just feels out of place. Yet, the variety though limited, most of the time feels well-placed.

8/10



Difficulty: 

One of the hardest ROM Hack I've played. The ""Elemental Masters"" replacing the Gym Leaders are increasingly difficult with slick strategies theses Elemental Masters will catch you off guard. And don't get me started on the ""Pokemon League"", dear lord, it took me various tries to pass such a difficult challenge. 

You have various rivals, some of them even carry legendary fake Pokemons, which after a few times after battling them, you'll see your rival sends out that Fake Pokemon which he has uses to hamper your momentum. 

Even average trainers become difficult late in game, as soon you realize the forced-lack of winning money, thus forcing you to strategize on how many full restores to buy and use in battles.

10/10


Replayability: Moderatly High.

Obligatory [link](http://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonROMhacks/comments/18n636/pekins_ruby_hack_more_fakemon_added_patch_updated/) to my previous post, in which I stated that the hack was now free of all encounters with real Pokémon. That was a load of crap, apparently, I hadn't tested it thoroughly. It is now, though! 177 Fakemon in total and no real Pokémon. At all.

The few things I've changed since my last post:

* A bunch of moves (Cut is replaced by Razor Chop, a Bug-type move with a base power of 80, Explosion is replaced by Metal Burst, signature move of Bombard - other than that, I've only made some changes to a couple of moves, mainly upping the base power of a couple of them, like Outrage, Submission and Petal Dance)
* Sprites that hover now have the circular shadow beneath them.
* New Fakemon.
* Removed *all* encounters with real Pokémon. (for realz this time. Hopefully)

But yeah, the hack is still Pokémon Ruby by all means. My next goal is to re-design some of the older sprites and add even more Fakemon. When I get to a total of at least 200, I'll start working on the actual hack. I have couple ideas for storyline, plot, characters, region and all that, but the final hack is still in the fairly distant future.

But more than that, I'm working on a Pokédex which will include abilities, movepools, all that jazz. It's still incomplete, though, so if you need to know the typings and the how-to's on all the evolutions, there is a simple text file for that purpose.

I'm still working on my scripting skills and a storyline for when I'm done adding fakemon to the hack. So, the final hack seems to be in the somewhat distant future for now - as far as story goes, the hack is still Ruby by all means.

I want to do the same for their BST distribution unless there's several same elemential type/same animal base Pokemon overlapping the same ""role"", such as the five billion water special punching bags. Sharing more (good)abilities will help and making more of them(with RPGMXP this will be so much easier) the most I think. 

My goal is to make almost every single Pokémon within batting range of each other to help promote Pokémon diversity in a ""rebuilding"" of HG/SS or maybe even a new storyline(with RPGMXP this will be so much easier). A triregion(Kanto-&gt;Johto-&gt;Hoenn) game in the vein of HG/SS with you as a Rocket is something I'm looking at.

1354790628.0,17,self.PokemonROMhacks,14dmoy,"Update Regarding Gen V Hacking, mainly re: Scripting",20,3,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonROMhacks/comments/14dmoy/update_regarding_gen_v_hacking_mainly_re_scripting/,"[**tldr, video**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncbJHL36FTQ)

**Introduction:**

We've been able to edit various aspects of the Gen V games like Wild Encounters, Trainers (and their Pokemon), and species characteristics. However, event scripts and map editing have been off the table... until now!

**Background:**

Gen III event scripting has been pretty well documented and there are multiple editors that cater to it. Gen V is fairly new and things aren't well documented, but given enough time the community has slowly been able to figure out how to create/edit (and loop) music easily, maps, and now.. how to create scripts from scratch.

Gen III ROM arrangement was pretty messy. New scripts and text had to be inserted at open offsets, and there was no filesystem which had everything organized. In the advent of DS games, files are now arranged neatly in folders (and individual files within). Hacking any aspect of the game, once documented, is fairly easy as you just have one file to edit (say, Encounters).

For a given map, there's data which determines which terrain is used, which text, script, overworld, etc. It essentially tells you which files it uses. By editing the files for the map, editing is really easy.

**Regarding Scripts:**

The main scripts for a given map are stuffed into one file, with pointers to each script @ the start. A NPC/event trigger is assigned a script, which then uses the pointer to see what script to run. 

The scripting process remains relatively the same, command, command, command. Since there are no editors which allow human friendly coding, everything has to be done via hex. It may be intimidating at first, but it's not hard! Over time we've figured out commands, given them names to understand how the script works, and finally we have been able to make script from scratch.

Drayano's Blaze Black 2 / Volt White 2 hacks are the first gen V hacks with customized scripts; at the time he didn't know how everything precisely worked. About a month later we've become more comfortable with commands and we have a way of quickly interpreting (via Lua script which reads the RAM). 

**Example:**

I wanted to demonstrate how the process works to re-purpose a useless NPC to do something special. I chose a helper NPC (in the Route Gates) and changed her script to give me an item.

[Here's the video.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncbJHL36FTQ)

I tried to quickly gloss over what each command did; it's not very n00b friendly. If you understand how scripts work in Gen III, making the leap to Gen V is easy! Feel free to follow along. I included the programs I used in the video description, or [you can directly download them here](http://www.mediafire.com/?qjst1rpibl70lp0).

With the Lua scripts provided, you are able to see how the script for a given map works (command names are WIP). Just interact with any NPC on the map, then run the Lua as shown in the video.

**Closing:**

Gen V is really close to being fully ""hackable"", like the custom GBA games. With Map Editors in development (NPRE/[SDSME](http://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?t=288625)), script editing being possible (overworlds are easy), we're able to make some pretty cool hacks for the DS games.

1354511607.0,16,self.PokemonROMhacks,146pmm,Hack Idea by Captain_Moscow,21,5,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonROMhacks/comments/146pmm/hack_idea_by_captain_moscow/,"I realize that this won't happen, but here's the story I'd love to see:  
The main character is Red's father in his younger 20s, and takes place back during the theorized War.  
The game starts out as a fairly stereotypical Pokemon game. Red's father (hereafter referred to as RF) is older than the typical main character, but given that there are an abundance of NPCs in the game that are adult trainers I think it works.)  
He's getting into Pokemon late along with his wife, Red's mother (RM), who both want to spice up their life and do something memorable before settling down (they are newlyweds).  
So, RF and RM travel around to a few cities doing the gym thing, seeing the game's main 'rival' the friendly but competitive Giovanni along the way, who is not Red's father as the conspiracy has commonly stated, but instead his father's brother, or Red's uncle.  
During the initial few hours of stereotypical play, there is background word being build up around an impending war. Think news snippets on the marquees, people talking, Gym leaders theorizing, etc.  
Eventually, after a certain point, war officially breaks out.  
RF and Giovanni are both forced to leave their home location (and RF his wife) to go and fight the war. This would open up a new kind of map exploration and change up the kind-of-stale travel to town, beat gym leader, repeat formula present since the original games.  
Instead of this, there would be different areas of conflict, and instead of gym leaders you would be fighting 'generals.' Giovanni would be by your side, changing from rival to partner.
This would allow the narrative to take a decidedly more mature tone, while still keeping it from actually dealing with death.  
The morality and necessity of war can be seen and discussed through the guise of battling Pokemon instead of shooting people. I think that the Pokemon games have been doing an increasingly good job of tackling real philosophical themes in their games, best shown by N's campaign to free Pokemon from animal cruelty (a real criticism of the franchise in real life).  
Towards the end of the game, Giovanni and RF are stuck in a tough situation, say the two of them vs 5 or 10 enemies. They appear stuck with no way out. RF decides to fend the enemies off so that his little brother, Giovanni, can escape.  
The player then enters a stream of battles that they cannot win, forcing them into inevitable defeat, showing Giovanni getting a bit farther away which each victory, eventually getting back to safety after his brother's last defeat.  
I know this is grim. As far as I know, nobody has died in a Pokemon title before. However, like I said, I think it is important for the franchise to expand their narratives to keep the mentally stimulating and socially relevant. This tasteful depiction of death, one for a good cause, is an interesting way to look at the idea of life and death in a context that is both unrealistic enough to not be overly morbid, while still realistic enough to send a message.  
The war eventually ends, and Giovanni is forever scarred, convinced that the world is cruel and unfair, and vows to become powerful enough to control things so that he can't ever be hurt again.  
Red's mother blames Giovanni for the death of her husband, and basically disowns him as part of her extended family, which is why he is never spoken about in the new games.
While a sad moment, things around the game can be seen improving as a direct result of RF's sacrifice, such as people being re-united with family, pokemon and trainers walking around without fear, gyms and poke centers being re-opened, etc.  
Then, after credits roll, the screen fades back in and you see Red's mother in a hospital bed. Red's mother, just after finishing the birth, says, 'Is it a boy or a girl?'

We've just made a map review thread and that's exactly the kind of direction I'm talking about going. As the thread gets older traffic will also die down so we could have map review mondays. How about one for original scripts? People could submit scripts for events that they have created themselves and this would not only help them to iron out any problems but also teach others in the community a lot about scripting and improve the quality of our hacks. Character sprite threads should also be a thing, I've seen a few people submit their player characters here and I like what I see. I think if we had a thread dedicated to it people would submit a lot more of their work.

Basically, you'll start in a small town, blah blah blah, and choose a 4th gen starter (I'll plant them in myself). En route, your first wild encounter is with a Celebi that brings you 20 or so years in the past. From there, you'll have a double-rival sort of thing with your now younger father, and his rival, your original rival's father. In game, there'll be the first 251 (gen 1 &amp; 2) pokemon, and after the elite 4, you find Celebi again and go forth 10 or so years, to the 3rd gen of pokemon.

Okay, So I suck at formatting, and what not, but here it goes.
This tutorial is a bit advanced, I'm not a fan of covering basics, so my tutorials will focus on cool little commands that you may not use very often.

This script is from my hack, Pokemon Olive Green. It is only part of the script as the script operates on many different events.

So I'll start with the Give Egg command. It does exactly what it sounds, gives you an egg. The command is written out like so.
    giveegg 0x(Pokemon Number Converted to Hexadecimal.)
Easy.

Next we'll go over pokepic, also a very easy command. It is written out like so.

    showpokepic 0x(Pokemon Number Converted to Hexadecimal.) 0x(""x"" coordinate of where the picture will appear on screen) 0x(""y"" coordinate of where the picture will appear on screen)

0x0A 0x03 is the centre of the screen. Remember to also include hidepokepic at some point in your script, or the picture won't disappear  until you load another map.

Lastly, is random. Which is written out like so.

    random 0x(number of options. if 03 is here, a number between 1 and 3 will be picked.)
    compare 0x800D 0x0
    if 0x1 goto @gen1
    compare 0x800D 0x1
    if 0x1 goto @gen2
    compare 0x800D 0x2
    if 0x1 goto @gen3
    end

The number is assigned to 0x800D. The compares find which number between 1 and 3 was chosen, and sends the script to that specific header.
Here's an example finding a number between 1 and 10.

    random 0x0A
    compare 0x800D 0x0
    if 0x1 goto @gen1
    compare 0x800D 0x1
    if 0x1 goto @gen2
    compare 0x800D 0x2
    if 0x1 goto @gen3
    compare 0x800D 0x3
    if 0x1 goto @gen4
    compare 0x800D 0x4
    if 0x1 goto @gen5
    compare 0x800D 0x5
    if 0x1 goto @gen6
    compare 0x800D 0x6
    if 0x1 goto @gen7
    compare 0x800D 0x7
    if 0x1 goto @gen8
    compare 0x800D 0x8
    if 0x1 goto @gen3
    compare 0x800D 0x9
    if 0x1 goto @gen9


That should finish it off. If you have any questions on anything in the script, even things that I haven't covered, feel free to ask.
I hope someone can get some knowledge out of this!

This is the second tutorial focusing on XSE scripting. We're going to expand on everything covered by the [first tutorial](http://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonROMhacks/comments/vktsj/tutorial_1_xse_scripting/) so if you haven't gone through it yet go back and work through it before attempting anything covered here. Due to the Reddit post character limit I've had to break what was originally one tutorial into two.

This tutorial will focus on a key concept called 'flags' and by the end of it you should have a working givepokemon script. This first part will focus on explaining flags as well as explaining the basic givepokemon command and the next part will will perfect the givepokemon script from part one.

As always if you have any questions, queries, or if you think anything needs clarification post a reply and I'll try and help.

##Section 1 - Hexadecimal

It's a *very* boring start to a tutorial but a basic knowledge of what hexadecimal is will go a long way. In the previous tutorial I slipped the word in without really mentioning what it is.

In its simplest form hexadecimal is just another number system. We use, without even thinking about it, a number system based on ten called decimal where each place value can have ten digits 0-9. Hexadecimal is similar but instead of using ten possibly digits it has 16, 0 through to F. A is 10, B is 11, ... F is 15.

|Decimal|Hexadecimal|
|:--|:--|
|00|0x00|
|01|0x01|
|02|0x02|
|03|0x03|
|04|0x04|
|05|0x05|
|06|0x06|
|07|0x07|
|08|0x08|
|09|0x09|
|10|0x0A|
|11|0x0B|
|12|0x0C|
|13|0x0D|
|14|0x0E|
|15|0x0F|
|16|0x10|

You'll have noticed that the hexadecimal numbers start with a leading 0x, this is just notation to indicate that instead of decimal numbers they're hexadecimal. When using XSE you'll find that you have to use hexadecimal, or hex, frequently. Sometimes you'll find you even have to convert between decimal and hexadecimal. That isn't too hard as XSE contains an inbuilt converter in the sidebar.

##Section 2 - An Introduction to givepokemon and giveegg

Now we've finished our theory lesson let's get started on scripting again with a very simple script.

    #dynamic 0x800000
    #org @givepokemon
    msgbox @1 0x2
    givepokemon 0x7B 0x5 0x44 0x0 0x0 0x0 
    end
    
    #org @1
    = Please take care of my Scyther for me.
    
The only command you probably haven't encountered before, is the **givepokemon** command.

|Command|Usage|Example|
|:--|:--|:--|
|givepokemon|Used to give pokémon to the player|givepokemon 0xPOKEMON_NUMBER 0xLEVEL 0XITEM_NUMBER 0x0 0x0 0x0|
|giveegg|Used to give an egg to the player|giveegg 0xPOKEMON_NUMBER
givepokemon is always followed by six arguments. The first argument is the number of the Pokémon to be given, the second is the level of the Pokémon, the third is the item number of the item the Pokémon should hold, and the last three are 'filler' values and should always be **0x0**.

In the example the pokémon 0x123 is Scyther, the Scyther is level 5, and Scyther is holding item number 0x44 which is a Rare Candy.

The giveegg command, which gives an egg to the player, is very similar but only uses a single argument which is the pokémon's number.

You can find lists of pokémon and item codes [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/ROMhacksLibrary/comments/vtedr/index/). Remember these values must be converted to hexadecimal.

Although this script would work correctly it's different to the ones you would've encountered in-game, such as Bill's Eevee script. After you received an Eevee from Bill he wouldn't give you another one, with this script you could collect as many Scythers as you liked. There's nothing in the script that checks to see if you've received a Scyther before. To fix this we have to use a flag.

---
##Section 3 - Meet the Flag
Imagine you're sorting through mail at a post office and some parcels are marked with a red stamp. These parcels are fast-tracked through the system and are sent to a special part of the sorting room. Parcels that aren't marked are treated normally. This is how flags worked.

In Pokémon flags are a hex value, for example 0x100, which are either switched on or off -- this is the stamp in our analogy. By checking if a flag is on or off the script can then determine how to proceed.

For example, let's think back to Bill's Eevee. When you talk to Bill the game checks to see if the Eevee flag is switched on or off. Since it's switched off the event plays and you can receive the pokémon, after this the Eevee flag is switched on. If you tried to talk to Bill again the script would detect that the flag was switched on and the script would use a different piece of dialogue instead of playing the event again.

Flags can *theoretically* be any hex value between 0x01 and 0xFFFF however, some flags are already used by the game, you can find lists of these [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/ROMhacksLibrary/comments/vtedr/index/).

There are three important commands when using flags.

|Command|Usage|Example|
|:--|:--|:--|
|setflag|Sets a flag|setflag 0xFLAG|
|checkflag|Checks to see if a flag is on or off |checkflag 0xFLAG|
|clearflag|Turns a flag off|clearflag 0xFLAG|

Let's look at how these commands work using an example of the Scyther script with flags added.

    #dynamic 0x800000
    #org @givepokemon
    checkflag 0x100
    if 0x0 goto @give
    msgbox @2 0x2
    end
    
    #org @give
    msgbox @1 0x2
    givepokemon 0x7B 0x5 0x44 0x0 0x0 0x0
    setflag 0x100
    end
    
    #org @1
    = Please take care of my SCYTHER for\nme.
    
    #org @2
    = How is my Scyther doing [player]?

The flag used here, 0x100, is set after the player receives the Scyther. 

Checkflag, which  either determines whether a flag is set/on (**0x1**) or not set/off (**0x0**), is used to determine whether the player has received a Scyther previously or not. checkflag is always followed by an **if** command.

|Command|Usage|Example
|:--|:--|:--|
|if|To conditionally check the value of the previous line|if 0xVALUE COMMAND|
|goto|Used to start executing another part of the script|goto @offset|

The if command checks to see if the previous line's value matches what's expected. In the example the previous line is a checkflag and the if command is checking if the flag is off (0x0). If the flag is off the **goto** command tells the script to continue running from the @give offset where the player is given a pokemon, the @1 msgbox appears, the flag 0x100 is set using **setflag**, and the script ends. If the flag is *off* then the script continues normally, the @2 msgbox appears and the script ends.

Notice how if the player has received a pokémon before because the flag is set the player cannot receive another.
If you try and compile this script and run it you'll notice it seems rather awkward. You get no confirmation you received the pokémon and you can't even open up the Pokémon menu to check it's there! In fact the only indication the script is running 'correctly' is that the character you ran the script on will switch dialogues after talking to him once. These are all limitations we'll cover in the next part of the tutorial. 

---
##Section 4 - More on Flags

Flags' main use is for ensuring events only occur once and for making overworld sprites disappear but a some flags have special predetermined effects. such as activating Running Shoes. A lot of things the player is made to believe are items are actually just flags that have been set. Here are some examples:

|Flag | Effect |
|:-- | :--|
|0x820|First Badge|
|0x828|Pokemon Menu Item|
|0x829|Pokedex|
|0x82F|Running Shoes|
A full list of these flags can be found [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/ROMhacksLibrary/comments/vtgcn/special_flags/).

These flags are used just like normal, they can be checked, cleared and set. Setting the flag activates that particular element. I.E. Setting the Running Shoes flag lets you use the Running Shoes and setting the First Badge flag awards you the first badge. 

The most unusual of the list is the 'Pokémon Menu Item', before you receive your first pokémon the menu item to access your pokémon is not available to you. It must be separately activated by setting the flag. We'll come across this in the next part of the tutorial.

---
##Section 5 -- What's Next?

This brings us to the end of this tutorial part. The next part will focus on perfecting the givepokemon script from section 3.

After a major setback, we have come to the conclusion that a (soft) reset is necessary. Fortunately, this does not mean an end to the plot that you selected.

So if you're interested in signing up to do a new hack, that's not quite enough. We absolutely need dedication.

We need: (List of things we need)

* Mappers
 * Will be drawing, designing, and rendering maps for the hack
* Scripters
 * Scripting (pretty straightforward)
  * The more ability you have the better
* Someone with ASM ability
 * Hex editing for more advanced features
  * The split
  * Dynamic weather
  * Other fun things you can think of
* Someone to compile everything
 * Literally this
* Plot writers
 * Our lead plot writer could of course use some assistance in writing the finer aspects of the story and dialogue
* Concept artists
 * Draw art for sprites and **potential** fakemon

If you are interested, please be able to provide proof of ability where applicable. That means for maps, we want to see a map. Scripts, send us a video of a script that you’ve written. If you are interested, make a top level comment containing what position(s) you are interested in and your proof of ability. **Anything that is not in a top level comment will be disregarded.**

Thanks and sorry for putting this off for so long

Now in their final evolved forms, they would be Rock/Dark, Steel/Psychic, and Fire/Fighting, meaning that the triangle would go both ways at this point.

Do you guys like this idea?

I changed up the starter triangle from Grass/Water/Fire, to Fire/Steel/Rock.

The starters are Torchic, Beldum, and Larvitar.

Larvitar and Pupitar have had their types changed to just rock, so that they don't mess up the triangle.  Tyranitar is still Rock/Dark.

Also made it so you get the National Dex when you get the Pokedex.

The starters stats may need to be balanced, any tips on this would be helpful.

I am currently working on changing trade evolutions, and making all pokemon attainable.  

EDIT:  I am also going through and changing the gym types.  So far I have (in order): Fighting, Flying, Water, Ghost, Dark, Poison, Fire, and Bug.  For the Elite 4 I plan on using Grass, Ice, Steel, and Psychic (no order on those yet).  I plan on keeping the layout of Kanto, but I may redo some of the maps.

There are instructions bundled with the .zip package that tell you where to get xDelta, the patching software I use. You do need to get a US version of Pokemon White, one that's been pre-anti-piracy patched.

~~[Official DropBox Link](https://www.dropbox.com/s/omfuhuevc4wybzo/Pokemon%20White%20649.zip) for those of you that don't like Mega. (As per brownie)~~

~~If the mods can add this to the dropbox, that would be great.~~ Also, anyone may feel free to put this in a more traditional patch format if they so wish.

Edit: Is anyone reporting that they can't patch their version of a White ROM? The White ROM I used as a base to create the patch for already had the anti-piracy patch applied to it and is a US ROM. If you think your ROM meets those conditions but it isn't working, please PM me.

Edit 2: I just realized that, nope! This isn't 649. I forgot, Gen V still has event mons... I got the event mons in Gen I-IV added, but not Gen V. I suppose you can always use an AR code to trigger the events or something. But I'll be adding them in a second patch soon.

1. [Palettes]Can Gimp export .pal files? Is there a program I can use effectively besides Photoshop or Gale?

2. [XSE/AdvanceMap]When writing scripts and creating maps, will the ROM run out of space? If so, how fast can I expect that to happen?

3. [Sprites]How can I measure the amount of bytes I need when using FSF? Also, the amount of bytes i'm adding/removing when editing pokemon sprites in the pokemon sprite editor. 

4. Where can I download unlz? I've had a couple bad downloads, and I can't figure out how to get it. 

5. [AdvanceMap] Is there a way to edit a tile without using the 4 square process, when inserting on the ""up"" block, how do I prevent accidentally editing a tile being used on the map, while still getting a background (say putting an object in the uptile and filling the down tile with grass.)

6. Intro Editing, is there a recommended guide? I have yet to walk through one but there are a ton that i've skimmed and they all seem to talk about different things.

7. [AdvanceMap Tiles] I've been editing the palettes for towns in order to save time and create a mapwide color effect, however these color changes transfer to all of the other maps in the section, is there a way to keep a palette to one map bank er... I'm not sure what the correct term is.

8. [General]Why is FireRed so highly recommended? I'd like to edit G/S/C or another generation, but I want to get some easier experience first. How different will editing another generation be?

9. [General]This is so time consuming! I've just started to get the ball rolling on some of these skills but I feel as though I could be doing things faster. One thing i've had trouble with is admittedly, i've restarted the ROM every time instead of trying to save. Can I save in-game, and start the ROM without having to go through the intro?

10. [General] Troubleshooting! Is there a site? A guide? All of these tutorials on pokecommunity give methods of how to do things but no methods for troubleshooting. What should I do when I run into trouble? (I had a ROM where whenever I spoke to a character, the ROM froze, also person events would be missing in some parts.)

11. [General] I'd like to post on the XSE guides my progress, but there is no reply option on the post. Am I too late?

Warning: Spoilers  
I just wanted to share some ideas and the slightly modified [route 2](http://i.imgur.com/Nejn2WZ.png). As you can see, there's now a small and rocky hill in Viridian Forest. This is because I decided to make the story happens in Kanto but in the future. You start as the original main character's younger brother who wanted to follow his brother's steps and become the new champion. Recently mysterious things have been happening in Kanto such as the terrain (New mountains, grass growing fast, new water bodies, etc) and climate changing. This has resulted in pokemon from Hoenn and Johto coming here and causing problems.  
Oak now gives you two missions: The usual pokedex quest but also finding out why all these things are happening and eventually stopping them.  
Some of you might have noticed the pokeball on the hill and thought: ""How do I get it?""  
The answer is by flying. I've always loved flying but I also thought that it was weird only being able flying to pokecenters so now you can fly to some mountains and places that would normally be out of reach, but only if someone has told you about it.

Today I'm here to give you an intro tutorial into basic editing of what B2W2 has to offer. For now I'll assume that you know nothing about hacking on the DS; but if you do, you can skip Section 0. This tutorial is somewhat brief - don't fear, editing DS games is VERY easy.

**Section 0 - Advantages of the DS Filesystem**

* In the GBA series of games, users have to manage many offsets and find free space for every addition they make. Additionally, everything is scattered around the ROM with no obvious organization. 
* In the DS series of games, similar files are packed together into separate files. These resources are loaded by the game overlays when required. This leads to a very organized file tree, which [you can see in this image](http://i.imgur.com/HXSrZ.png). 

---------------------------------------------------------

* Due to this tidy separation of files, it is important to know what the ""file extensions"" are.

| Extension | Description |  
|:--: | :-- |  
|**.sdat** | Audio data file used by the Nintendo DS, a portable game system; contains sound files for the game, such as .SSEQ audio files; used to store music and sounds that are played back during gameplay.|  
|**.narc** | Archive file used by games for the Nintendo DS portable gaming system; may contain various game data, including graphics, text, and level information; typically contained within a Nintendo DS ROM file; can be unpacked with some editing tools.|  
|**.bin** | Binary file used by the Nintendo DS series portable gaming systems; contains executable data for a Nintendo DS game; can be used to patch, or modify, emulated Nintendo games for DS emulators.|

These are the most common file extensions you will see in DS games, they are essentially packed up files. Other extensions can be seen for **Pallets, Images, Tiles, and animations**. These won't be covered since this is just an intro.

---------------------------------------------------------

**Section 1 - Common Focuses of ROM Hacks**

When you think of a ROM hack, what first comes to mind? You have Trainers, Wild Encounters, Movesets, Evolutions, Overworld/Event Scripts, and Maps. 

For this tutorial, we'll be focusing on the easiest ones: Editing Trainers to make them harder/unique and to edit what appears in the grass. The two tools we will be using today are Pokemon ROM Changer and BWTE v2 to make our edits to our B2W2 game. Both of these programs are in the [Community Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/opb8xcv4zrc8tgj/wEr0fW8Ang/Hacking%20Tools/PC/NDS/Black%202%20%26%20White%202).

----------------------------------------------------------

**Section 2 - Editing Encounters, Species, and Evolutions**

With an unmodified ROM, you can use Pokemon ROM Changer (PRC) to edit these aspects. The version uploaded to the Community Dropbox supports English ROMs (trimmed or untrimmed). 

* When you open the program, you will be greeted with the [Main Window which displays the basic Species editor](http://i.imgur.com/TwdLk.png).
* Editing is very easy. Just select the species that you want to edit, change its Base Stats / TM Learnset / etc.
* If you select the [Evolution Editor tab](http://i.imgur.com/3DTbU.png), the program will display the methods of evolution instead of the species characteristics. You can easily switch back to the Species editing tab whenever.

To edit the wild Pokemon that appear, Click on Tools (which is right next to File in the top Left). 

* Select Encounter Slot Editor, and a new window will pop up.
* Select a location that you wish to edit. The UI is straight-forward in how to edit..
* Encounter ""Slots"" have different chances of being chosen. In general, the higher the slot # the less % chance the Pokemon has of appearing relative to the rest.
* For water encounters, there's less slots (and with different % chances)
* Ignore the ""Habitat Header"" data at the bottom. 

| Slot # | Appearance Chance |  
|:--: | : |  
|Slot 0| 20%|
|Slot 1| 20%|
|Slot 2| 10%|
|Slot 3| 10%|
|Slot 4| 10%|
|Slot 5| 10%|
|Slot 6| 5%|
|Slot 7| 5%|
|Slot 8| 4%|
|Slot 9| 4%|
|Slot 10| 1%|
|Slot 11| 1%|

You can also use the move editor to change up base power and typing of moves, but for most hacks it's best to keep them the same.

**When you are done with your changes, be sure to ""File -&gt; Save ROM"" before exiting.**

------------------------------------------------------

**Section 3 - Extracting NARCs**

As discussed in Section 0, files used for the same purpose are kept together inside a container file with a .narc extension. Think of it as an uncompressed ZIP file. 

We will use Nitro Explorer to extract and reinsert NARCs (into/from the ROM), and editor.exe to unpack and pack individual NARCs.

MODS: [add these to the dropbox](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/12206225/pporg/Nitro%20%26%20Editor.zip)

------------------------------------------------------

**Section 4 - Editing Trainers and their Pokemon**

[KazoWAR (the maker of BWTE) has made a video tutorial on how to use his tool](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVVjaRgmB9Y). 

[Here's a picture of what BWTE v2 looks like](http://i.imgur.com/6pmNr.png).

Just do the same thing he does....**EXCEPT**

* Extract/Reinsert /a/0/9/1 as trdata (rather than a092)
* Extract/Reinsert /a/0/9/2 as trpoke (rather than a093)

His video was made for BW1, B2W2 uses a091 &amp; a092 for trainers and their Pokemon.

Note: 

* When you re-insert a narc, the file size of your ROM will almost always change. There are ways to use PRC with a modified ROM; but that is a more advanced topic. 
* You can re-insert as many times as you want. The program just switches the two files. 
* Since we are editing NARCs, no matter how many times you edit the file you can always repeat with a modified Trainer Data/Poke narc.

-----------------------------------------------------

**Section 5 - Closing**

With these two tools you can make huge edits to your B2W2 ROM. There are tons of more things we are able to edit; these are by far the easiest to learn to hack DS games with so it's best to end here :)

If you have any questions, please ask and I'll be happy to answer!

Basically, the entire format has changed. So, instead of struggling to word it myself, here is a direct quote from the post that was sent to all mods:
&gt;How does it work?

&gt;1. We'd like to encourage you, the mods, to start planning your own best of nominations and awards within your communities. Ideally these would be voted on by the members of your community. Come up with interesting and fun categories (most citations in /r/askscience? saddest poem in /r/poetry?), and engage your subreddits to pick out their favorite stuff of the year (even from other subreddits, if you want to!).
2. Let's get organized together in /r/bestof2012. Instead of being a staging area for nominations and awards, this year let's use it to aggregate all of the best of threads in each community, turning it into a single starting point where people can dive into all of the cool stuff from the past year.
3. We'll promote /r/bestof2012 across the site and in our 2012 wrap up blog post. We will also, by request, provide 5 gold creddits for subreddits with over 500 subscribers to award to the winners of their own best of ceremonies.

&gt;We may make some changes or announce additional tweaks based on your feedback as we get closer to awards time. Please use /r/bestof2012 to stay abreast of updates.

&gt;We have a few weeks to get this underway, and we're going to need everyone's help and participation to make this a success. Inspired or have an awesome idea for a subreddit? Start up a discussion and trade notes. Want to help out with /r/bestof2012? Let's get in touch!

So basically, we're holding our own Best Of rewards! But we thought, let's put a spin on it! We're going to hold contests and see who can have the best post! Here are the categories!

* Best Map
 * Create your own **original** map and submit it as a link in the [BestOf2012 Map thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonROMhacks/comments/14i1mj/official_bestof2012_map_thread/)!

* Best Script
 * Have a script that you think the community should see? Post it in the [BestOf2012 Script thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonROMhacks/comments/14i1pg/official_bestof2012_script_thread/) along with what the script does!

* Best Hack
 * Did you submit a hack to the community during the year? Maybe you were going to submit one by the end of the year? Well, here is the perfect opportunity! Share your hack on the [BestOf2012 Hack thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonROMhacks/comments/14i1tl/official_bestof2012_hack_thread/) and you might win!

Their history and purpose are unknown (until the end...), but that doesn't concern the rest of the game.
We would control a stowaway who followed their father to the newly discovered region of Hoenn, inhabited by tribal peoples and an abundance of wild Pokémon, who must also prove themselves as a useful member of the team and a friendly face to the natives. Little does the team know that there are warring tribes who hope to control Groudon and Kyogre (it's Emerald-based...) after a meteorite impact triggered a volcanic eruption and woke them!
A full plot has already been developed and I have begun the arduous task of mapping and trying character design ideas. New tiles would be excellent to design villages around what type they worship or revere (meaning what they use in their ""gym"" or found in the wild nearby).

--Most places have been expanded and all 386 Pokémon will be catchable in the wild with legendaries sometimes having their own new areas, i.e. Lati@s on Southern Island, Mew on Faraway Island, Jirachi getting its own area of Meteor Falls, and so on.

--Completely new routes and areas (hidden pyramid/ruins?) for explorers to take before paved and well-traveled routes allow wildlife to fill in completely in the future; also old routes being more overgrown and randomly set up.

--Treasure hunters were looking for the Regi trio, but their ship ran aground and after a few months set up a colony/NEW TOWN!

--Natives will speak broken english with romaji mixed in and locales will be named accordingly (Sootopolis = Rune, Pacifidlog = Kinagi).

--Along the way you will meet other explorers and scientists from your Team who will aid your journey with TMs, deleting moves, and so on.

--New ""gym"" challenges and types!

--TARDIS cameo...? No involvement. It'd just be kind of sitting there. If you don't know what the TARDIS is, you really should find out. lol

--Mini-plots will involve tribal leaders (Mossdeep/Tokusane Island is run by the twins who use psychic Pokémon to rule the island with fear/voodoo)

--The (future) Elite 4 will be the Team HQ where you will need to be tested and deemed worthy of being an official Team member, validating all of your hard work and research into this new land... But there is a MASSIVE twist in the plot after that. One visit to the Battle Frontier will clear everything up and you, the player, will be tested as everything from then on will be a matter of your own moral compass.

--There exists a possibility of adding events from game or anime history, such as the White Sage and Claydol story from ""Claydol Big and Tall,"" for example.

Meanwhile, back in your world, no one trusts you any longer and a huge reward is placed for your capture. You must play through the game, gaining the trust of pokemon and avoiding humans, and find the real maestro behind the scheme.

A basic synopsis of Pokemon MysticArelian Version for the uninformed:
*Is set in a new region named Junnin, with +80 new Pokemon. The region is Australia influenced.
*The professor's name is Pine, who works in a bio-dome/laboratory combo and studies ecology. Instead of getting their starter Pokemon from Pokeballs, they instead have hatched from eggs and start out at level 1.
*The three starter Pokemon are the Small-Leaf Pokemon Eucuwala (A highly social green koala bear Pokemon, with physical orientated stats), the Swinging Pokemon Kindlemur (An agile lemur Pokemon, with speed orientated stats), and the Fin Pokemon Dimetrus (An aquatic dimetrodon Pokemon, with defensive orientated stats). 
*The main villainous team of the region is named Team Zodiac, and is split into 12 sub-admins based off of the western zodiac and a main admin, based and named after Ophiuchus. They are after the legendary Pokemon Orakey, said to hold all of the answers to the universe. The sub-admins (if any) are based off of their respective zodiacs. For example, Sub-Admin(s) Pisces are actually male/female twins, specialize in Water and Ice type Pokemon, and have a bad habit of interrupting each other.

1. Which existing starters should stay in the rom hack, Gen I, Gen II, Gen III, Gen IV, or Gen V? I might keep both of the remaining gen starters, but I was thinking of having a set of six mid-game trades, three for each starter set left. They may pick one trade out of the six, and once they choose, the rest vanish but the set you didn't pick is offered as a reward for a post-game dungeon.

2. Which Pokemon do you think should stay, if any in particular? Your suggestion(s) doesn't have to be before Generation IV. If you suggest a Pokemon, should there be any changes made? Like new moves, via egg moves, level, tm, tutor, etc. Base stats, etc. Nothing un-nessasary though please, constructive changes only. The list below is a reserved slots list, due to pre-evo/new-evo plans based off of MagesPages' source art:
Tropius (pre-evo)
Aerodactyl (pre-evo)
Murkrow (pre-evo)
Honchkrow (included because previous evolution has a new pre-evo)
Mr. Mime (evo)
Skarmory (pre-evo)
Riolu (split-evo, technically sort of...female versions, like miltank and tauros)
Lucario (split-evo, technically sort of...female versions, like miltank and tauros)
Smoochum (included because it's evolution has a new evo)
Jynx (evo)
Omanyte (evo)
Omastar (evo)
Smeargle (pre-evo)
Tangela (pre-evo)
Tangrowth (included because previous evolution has a new pre-evo)
Sneasel (pre-evo)
Weavile (included because previous evolution has a new pre-evo)
Sableye (evo)

3. What should the heroine look like?
Hair style? Hair color? Clothes? Such as what type of shoes? What sort of t-shirt? Any accesories such as like watches? What color should her backpack be?

4. What should the rival be like and look like?
What should be the default name(s)? What sort of personality? Snooty and cocky like Gen I's rival? Cruel and antagonistic like Gen II's rival? Friendly like the later generation rivals? A composition/something more complex? Any motives or goals they have? Any particular past events in their lives?
Hair style? Hair color? Clothes? Such as what type of shoes? What sort of t-shirt? Any accesories such as like sunglasses?

5. See this map below? It has a list of numbered markers, which are unknown/un-named areas. Any ideas of what each of these areas should be, what sort of Pokemon they have available (including of the regional dex; [url=http://imgur.com/a/mdQMp#0]http://imgur.com/a/mdQMp#0[/url], so please look at that before listing any suggested Pokemon!), what purpose should they fill, etc?

1361633506.0,12,self.PokemonROMhacks,192y66,Tutorial: Changing the move contained in any TM,13,1,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonROMhacks/comments/192y66/tutorial_changing_the_move_contained_in_any_tm/,"The aim of this tutorial is to be able to allow you to change the TMs in your copy of Firered. While this tutorial is aimed at Firered, I will also provide the offsets for Ruby and Emerald. TMs are often a feature that aren't changed in hacks, which to me is one of the defining aspects of originality.

Tools you will need:
A hex editor (I am using Goldfinger, which is simple and free)
Windows Calculator (Programmer mode)
or any other alternate Dec to Hex calculator.

**Section 1: Preparation**

Many people just from reading the word 'Hex Editor' will likely be put off, however changing TMs is really not that daunting and only a very basic understanding of hex is needed.

To those that aren't aware about the specifics of hex, or the basics for that matter, hex is an alternate number system that is linked with binary. Each byte contains 2 numbers from 0 - F where A, B, C, D, E and F are equal to 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. The only way this really applies to the tutorial is that you know you need to convert. 

To begin, you need to choose a move to implement as a TM. In this case I will be using Hydro Pump. You will need to know its index number. This can be found by clicking the following link. 

http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/List_of_moves

As the list shows, Hydro Pump's index number is 56. However this is in the decimal system. Open up windows calculator and select programmer mode. Make sure the calculator is on Dec. and then type in your index number, so I would type 56.

http://i.imgur.com/DT8RWtN.png

Then click Hex. which is above Dec. It will then have converted your number, in my case 56 becomes 38. Now write your move down in Notepad or wherever you will be able to access it quickly in the form XXYY, where YY are the first two numbers of your hex, and XX are the last two. If you use a move like Hydro Pump, write it down in the form 38 00. It will always be a 4 digit number. If you have a three digit number in hex such as 17D, write it down as 7D 01.

You now have your move in byte form.

**Section 2: Replacing the TM**

Here is where we crack open the Hex Editor. Luckily it is a very simple process and you don't need to be particularly familiar with Hex Editing. Open up your rom with your hex editor. Every hex editor has a 'goto' function, what it is named is different for each editor but in the case of Goldfinger it can be found by clicking F5 or under the Edit header.

http://i.imgur.com/mWzz13M.png

Type in the following offset:
45A80C

This is where the TM table is located. This is specific to Firered so don't try this in Ruby or Emerald. For Ruby it is located at 376504, and in Emerald it is located at 615B94.

Once at your offset you should see the following bytes

08 01 51 01. 

http://i.imgur.com/nOUKPLA.png

These are the first two TMs. 08 01 in the form YYXX will be 108, which in Dec. is equal to 264, which is the index number for Focus Punch. For some reason the hex is backwards so as stated before it is placed in the form XXYY. Every two bytes is a different TM, so you can find each TM number fairly easy by navigating from this first byte. 

Take note of the two bytes you will be replacing, and the two bytes following it. In this tutorial I will be replacing TM01 with Hydro Pump. So I would write down 08 01 51 01. Type in your converted index number over the first two bytes. It should now say 38 00 51 01. Click save. Make sure that you only overwrite the first two bytes, otherwise you will edit the other TM.

**Section 3: Replace other bytes**

Now, open up the search feature in your hex editor (in Goldfinger this can be opened with F7) and type in the bytes you wrote down originally, in my case 08 01 51 01. In the replace box below type in your new bytes, which in my case are 38 00 51 01.

http://i.imgur.com/PQD2JYh.png

Click replace.
It should say that there are no results, and it should prompt you to start search from the beginning of the rom. Click yes.

http://i.imgur.com/l1VIkhp.png

It should take you to the offset 45A5A4 if you are replacing the first TM. Click replace. Then click save.

Congratulations you have now replaced your first TM.

Note: This will not automatically change the Pokemon which are able to learn the TM. You can do that with either Pokemon Game Editors Pokemon Editor, or YAPE. I recommend PE in PGE, solely because it supports new moves. So if for some reason you have extended the move table to include Gen 4 and 5 moves or custom moves, PE will be able to display the correct move data to avoid confusion. Also PGE contains many tools that will allow for better TM customisation such as the Item editor and the attack editor.

Note two: This alone will not change the TM information about the move. You can either do this with Advance-text or by repointing the TM description data within PGE's Item Editor, to the offset of the move you've changed the TM to. This offset can be found with PGE's attack editor.",,False,,t5_2t5aw,1361634315.0,,,True,t3_192y66,http://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonROMhacks/comments/192y66/tutorial_changing_the_move_contained_in_any_tm/,

**What you'll need:**  
Advance Map 1.92 (to assign the battle to a sprite)  
XSE (I use version 1.1.1)  
A-Trainer  
  
---
##Section 1: The Setup  
The new code here is:  
`trainerbattle 0x0 0xTRAINER_NUMBER 0x0 @intro @defeat`  
**Here's what it does:**  


| Code | Description |
|:--: | :-- |
| `trainerbattle`| tells XSE that you're going to fight someone|
| `0x0`| it's just needed so keep it|  
| `0xTRAINER_NUMBER`| This is what you need A-trainer for. You're going to put the trainer number from there in the place of TRAINER_NUMBER.|  
| `0x0`| just leave it alone again|  
| `@intro`| this is going to be a message box, it's going to be what the trainer says before the battle starts.|  
| `@defeat`| this is what the trainer says during the battle but after you win.|

Here we'll look at how the full code will look when you put it in XSE:  
  
    #dynamic 0x800000  
    #org @start  
    trainerbattle 0x0 0x0C3 0x0 @intro @defeat  
    msgbox @msg 0x2  
    end  
  
    #org @intro  
    = Hey kid, nice bike!  

    #org @defeat  
    = Well, back to the road I go.  
  
    #org @msg  
    = Have you heard of PETA? Their HQ\nis to the south in Wicari City.  
  
You'll notice a msgbox after the trainerbattle code. That's what the trainer will say when you talk to them on the map after you've already battled them!  

---
## Section 3: The Gym Battle  
  
  The Gym leader code is very similar but there are two key differences:  
  `trainerbattle 0x1 0xTRAINER_NUMBER 0x0 @intro @defeat @after`  
  Instead of a 0x0 we have a 0x1, that's to tell the game that there's going to be a little something extra. And that lil' something is the @after you see following the @defeat.  This is a separate message (or whatever you want!) that will happen, immediately following the battle, on the map!  

---  
##Section 4: Gym Code Example  

    #dynamic 0x800000  
  
    #org @start  
    trainerbattle 0x1 0x14E 0x0 @intro @defeat @after  
    msgbox @msg 0x2  
    end  
  
    #org @after  
    msgbox @msg2 0x2  
    end  
  
    #org @intro  
    = Wanna fight?  
  
    #org @defeat  
    = How'd I lose?  
  
    #org @msg  
    = I say this when you ask to talk to\nme again.  
  
    #org @msg2  
    = I say this right after our battle\nno matter what!

I'm new to the pokemon hack-making community but I'm a huge pokemon fan as well as a computer science student and active programmer (Some but not all game-related).  I've recently decided that I want to start working on a ROM-Hack of FR/LG that revolves around this storyline.  Lt. Surge mentions that electric Pokemon saved his life in the war but we never heard anything more about this ""war"".  So now, many years after R/B/Y in a new region that I've yet to name there's a new trainer (you).  Who goes off and does his typical quest, battling gym leaders, earning badges, tackling the league and whatnot.  Except he's followed and periodically checked up on by Government officials (although you don't know that at the time) to test his skill.  

Upon becoming league champion you are approached by these officials who reveal themselves to you and tell you that the Kanto region is preparing to invade and declare war on your region.  They want you, the new champion to lead the front for your region and be victorious over Kanto.  You accept, only with a secondary motive to end the war peacefully between both sides.  No one knows this except you however, so you take command as general of your region, working with the elite four, gym leaders, and notable trainers.  Again this long battle continues and some story elements take place that I'd like to keep secret (These tie the story together).  The idea is you stop the war between your region and kanto, and usher in an era of peace in the world once more.

TL;DR:

War takes place as once reference by Lt. Surge in Gen 1.

I have chosen Abra as the psychic. Obviously, Abra does not start with any attack moves, so I want to give the player a TM10 (Hidden Power) should he choose Abra. The problem is, the code is extremely confusing. Here is the snippet of original code after the player has made his final selection:

    #org 0x169C74
    hidepokepic 
    hidesprite LASTTALKED 
    msgbox 0x818E2E5 MSG_KEEPOPEN '""This POKéMON is really quite\nener...""

I have a rough concept of the game.

You start out in Pallet Town, 10 years after two Trainers from Pallet, (If possible, I would like both to be customizable) beat the Elite Four and became Champions. Since then, the criteria for challenging the Elite Four have gotten tougher. There are now 16 gyms, and the original E4 have been replaced by 4 all around trainers, while the E4 have been demoted to gyms. Along the way, Team Rocket is trying to restore its former glory, with a new leader. Afterwards, you can go to the newly opened port at Pallet, and try to strengthen your team by going to other regions. Once you feel ready, you can enter the Pokemon World Championships, and play in a tournament (similar to the Pokemon League in the anime, but on a larger scale) to try to become the world's #1 Pokemon trainer. 

Hopeful Features:

Will be able to catch all pokemon (including X and Y when it comes out)

Will NOT have long intros, or teaching things (Old Man Catching Pokemon)

Inter-Region Travel (Kanto, Johto, Hoenn, Sinnoh, Unova, and Kalos)

An Overview and Priority Order:
     I want Pokemon Inferno to be challenging, but fun, for adults. It will be made from a FireRed base, and have all Gens 1-5, with move information up to date to the 5th pokedex. I'll derive this info from serebii.net . It will have you start off in Kanto, then Johto, Hoenn, and finally an original region named Takubi (Japanese for ""Last Effort""). Kanto level progressions will be similar to the original, but by the end of Johto the entire elite four will have all level 100s. Except for the last region, all trainers will have technically possible teams, but gym leaders will always have 6 pokemon and follow gym themes, but will have 1-3 pokemon that cover those theme's weaknesses. They will also have increasingly intelligent movesets, hold items, etc. At the end there will be a ""Grand Champion"" once you beat all four regions.

Goal 1: A) Have Maps Made and B) all 649 Pokemon w\ 5thDex info

As such, I was hoping there was some tool to extract all text and output it to some kind of file, text or csv or something. Help would be greatly appreciated. It doesn't matter much which game the tool is for as I'll probably just play whichever game makes this easiest, first.

Opening information:

Each Legendary has it's own cult, some larger than other's, some down to the very last member.

No gyms, all battles happen as seemingly random interactions, like rival fights.

[This would be the reference for the interactions](http://i.imgur.com/r5LPb.jpg)

If any of you know the anime ""fate/stay night"" basically same idea (big battle, champions chosen, individual fights, lessons learned.)

you play as a young man (or woman), a priest in the cult of Arceus ""The Creator."" one day you're out in a secluded field wandering, meditating, you trip on an empty pokeball, you pick it up, you look up, and Arceus is there, he explains to you how you have to win the competition to prove that Arceus is the true deity of all. 

***you start out with a level 5 Arceus***

The cult of Arceus is dedicated to serving justice, and light, and truth, and all the good stuff, followers wear white robes with the emblem of Arceus (his rings) around their necks. (Like a crucifix necklace)

but the heads of this massive cult worship Giratina in secret.

Dialga, and Palkia know this, and want nothing to do with the cult that has sprung up in their name, due to the true nature of the cult.

but Giratina captured D&amp;P in his alternate universe, and will only release them if they fight for the one Giratina charges for the competition, to prove that their cult is the only true cult. (will be made known after (pope?) is defeated)

The head of the cult (Pope?) is the one charged with winning.

you show up to the HQ, (vatican city?) challenge (Pope?), he accepts, you battle in the middle of the city, at this point in time we only know him to worship D&amp;P, so he uses D&amp;P, but then throws out Giratina as his third poke, that's when the truth is revealed about him capturing D&amp;P, and the whole cult is a lie.

I have been playing pokemon games on the VBA emulator for a while, and fire red has to be my favorite, but I'm stuck.

This is the first game that I've been using pokemon that need to be traded to evolve. I have a Haunter, Kadabra, and Seadra. I would really by thrilled if I could evolve them. However, I can't trade them! I know for the VBA emulator you need the link, which I have downloaded, but I cannot load my game on the VBA link! I cannot save in the game either, I get an error message when I try so I've been saving it using the save option on the emulator. If I could only figure out just how to load my game on the VBA link I know exactly what to do from then on, but I can't!

Help is so greatly appreciated, if moderators need to move this somewhere more appropriate that would be fine. I didn't really find anything that covers my question and my saving issue is seeming to be specific to fire red.

This tutorial was originally intended to be part of the [previous tutorial](http://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonROMhacks/comments/vx9ji/xse_tutorial_2_give_pok%C3%A9mon_and_flags_part_1/) however due to the Reddit character limit I couldn't fit it in a single post so they were split up into two and I've expanded on a couple of points. If you haven't gone through the previous tutorial you're going to have a bad time so go back to the second tutorial if you have skipped it or feel you need to reacquaint yourself with any of the commands covered there.

The aim of this tutorial is to create a 'perfect' version of the givepokemon script we created in the second tutorial whilst covering Yes/No msgboxes and the gosub and call commands. It's a very quick a dirty tutorial, and there's not much depth. It's mostly about learning a couple of commands and tying together some knowledge to produce a working script.

As always if you have any questions, queries, or if you think anything needs clarification post a reply and I'll try and help.

---
#Section 1 - Comments

I apologise again for starting with a boring topic but this is a quick one and it's pretty damn useful. You'll notice from this point onwards the example scripts are a little more complex and a lot longer. One of the useful features of XSE is that it has a great commenting system. Comments are small snippets of text that you can use to place reminders next to lines of code that won't be compiled. 

There are two types of comments: block comments which allow a comment to span multiple lines and in-line comments which are restricted to a single line and usually follow the command. 

Block comments start with /* and end in */.

    /* This whole block
    is commented
    as an example */    

There are three variations of inline comments **'**, **//**, and **;**. Throughout these tutorials I'll use **//** to avoid confusion with other scripting languages but below you can see examples of inline commenting using all three styles.

    #org @example
    msgbox @1 0x2 'This produces a messagebox for the player with lock and faceplayer
    givepokemon 0x123 0x5 0x44 0x0 0x0 0x0  //This gives the player a level 5 Scyther with a Rare Candy
    end ;This ends the script
    
---
##Section 2 - Notification

Let's start with a quote from the previous tutorial.

&gt;If you try and compile this script and run it you'll notice it seems rather awkward. You get no confirmation you received the pokémon and you can't even open up the Pokémon menu to check it's there! In fact the only indication the script is running 'correctly' is that the character you ran the script on will switch dialogues after talking to him once.

Despite the fact the player receives the pokémon -- the player doesn't receive any confirmation that they did. This is bad practise for any type of scripting, you have to let the player know that something occurred. In a retail Pokémon game three events occur that let the player know that they have received a pokémon: a fanfare plays, a message appears '[Player] received [Pokémon]' which is not dismissed automatically, and you get the option to nickname it. 

To emulate this we're going to modify our previous script this time so that that a message appears when the player receives the Scyther, a fanfare plays at the same time, and the player has the option to nickname their pokémon. This will involve calling other scripts, such as the nicknaming script, while our script is running. It might help to have a copy of the original script from the last tutorial for comparison.

    #dynamic 0x800000
    #org @givepokemon
    checkflag 0x100
    if 0x0 goto @give
    msgbox @2 0x2
    end
    
    #org @give 
    msgbox @1 0x2
    givepokemon 0x7B 0x5 0x44 0x0 0x0 0x0
    fanfare 0x13E //Plays the player received pokemon fanfare
    msgbox @notify 0x4
    waitfanfare
    closeonkeypress 
    setflag 0x100
    msgbox @qname 0x5 //Asks the player if they want to nickname their pokemon
    compare 0x800D 0x1 //Checks to see if the player selected 'Yes'
    if 0x1 gosub @nickname //If yes then the @nickname script will run and then return
    msgbox @3 0x2
    end
    
    #org @nickname
    call 0x1A74EB //Calls the script responsible for nicknaming the pokemon
    return //Forces the script back
    
    #org @1
    = Please take care of my Scyther for me.
    
    #org @2
    = How is my Scyther doing [player]?
    
    #org @notify
    = [Player] received SCYTHER!
    
    #org @qname
    = Would you like to give SCYTHER a\nnickname?
    
    #org @3
    = I hope you take good care of it
    
There's a lot of new commands and msgbox types and the script is getting pretty big so let's just look at the portions that are changed, **#org @give** and **#org @nickname**.

|Command|Usage|Example|
|:--|:--|:--|
|fanfare|Interrupts the in-game music to play a sound|sound 0xNUMBER|
|sound|Plays a sound without interrupting the in-game music|sound 0xNUMBER|

The first new command is **fanfare**, which is very similar to the sound command. Both commands play jingles but fanfare interrupts the in-game music and so is commonly used for notifications you really want to grab the players attention. In the example script the fanfare played is 0x13E, which refers to the 'Acquisition Pokemon' 
fanfare. A full list of the fanfares and jingles you can use with the fanfare command can be found [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/ROMhacksLibrary/comments/w7phf/fanfare_codes/). The msgbox after the fanfare is not one we've come across before. If we venture back to tutorial one we learnt that msgbox **0x4** was the same as 0x6 except that it didn't automatically close when another command was used. We can use this in combination with the command **waitfanfare**, which pauses the game until the fanfare is complete, because the msgbox won't automatically close when the fanfare plays. The **closeonkeypress** command will close the msgbox when A or B is pressed.

|Command|Usage|Example|
|:--|:--|:--|
|compare|Compares the value of an offset to a desired result|compare 0x800D 0x1|
|gosub|Goes to another part of the script but returns after the offset ends|gosub @OFFSET| 
|call|Calls another script **whilst* your script is running and then returns|call @OFFSET|
|return|Tells the script when to return always used with gosub and call|#org @example fanfare 0x100 return|

We also use another kind of new msgbox, msgbox **0x5**, which is a 'Yes or No' msgbox. This msgbox is always used in conjunction with the compare 0x800D command. Let's examine how this works. The player is asked if they'd like to nickname their Pokémon and their answer, either yes (0x1) or no (0x0),  is stored in the location **0x800D**. The **compare** command looks up the pointer 0x800D and compares the command either to 0x1 (yes) or 0x0 (no). The shortcode 'LASTRESULT' can be used in place of 0x800D.

The **if** command then does the same thing it did previously, it checks if the value matches and if it does it proceeds. Except this time instead of goto the script uses using **gosub** which is very similar. The gosub command executes a different section of script but unlike goto it doesn't terminate there, after that section of script ends it *returns* and continues from where the gosub originated from. In this example, the script would execute @nickname but when @nickname ends it would go back and continue from @give.

@nickname uses the **call** command which executes a piece of script elsewhere in the ROM. The offset it's using, 0x1A74EB, is the location of the nicknaming script. The **return** command tells the the script to go back to the line after the gosub, in this case msgbox @3.

---
##Section 3 - Perfecting the Script

We're very close to having a perfect, and fairly advanced, givepokemon script. There are two instances in which the script we made above would ""fail"" -- if the player had six pokemon in their party already or if the player had not yet unlocked the 'Pokémon' item in the menu so that they could access their pokémon. Here's some information on how to overcome these limitations but it's up to you to implement them in a script.

**Fixing the Pokémon menu not appearing**  
If we recall the end of the last tutorial we learnt that some flags have special effects. One such flag, 0x828, when set allows the player to access the Pokémon item of the in-game menu. Making sure this flag is set will ensure that the player can access their pokémon. 

**Fixing the player having a full party**   
This is another easy fix. The command **countpokemon** counts the number of pokemon there are in the players party and stores the value at 0x800D. We can then use the compare command, similar to before, to check if the player has six pokémon in their party.

A small sample of script that would count the number of pokemon might look like:

    #dynamic 0x800000
    #org @count
    countpokemon
    compare LASTRESULT 0x6 //Checks the LASTRESULT variable (0x800D) to see if there are 6 pokemon
    if 0x1 goto @full
    msgbox @1 0x2
    end
    
    #org @full
    msgbox @2 0x2
    end
    
    #org @1
    = You have a spare pokémon slot in\nyour party!
    
    #org @2
    = You have a full pokémon party!

##Section 4 - Extension

To check your knowledge of tutorial two and three try producing one of the following scripts and posting them as a reply.

* Produce a 'perfect' givepokemon script. (Includes the Pokémon menu and full party fixes)
* Produce a 'perfect' givepokemon script that offers the player a choice to receive the pokémon or not.

I am the founder of the subreddit and — dare I say it — a talented scripter. That's why I have come on this fine morrow to instruct the young ones who've never been instructed before on the art of scripting. This is simply part one in my series, and I will continue doing things such as mapping.

Now, first things first, this guide is meant for use with the eXtreme Script Editor (XSE). Secondly, this entry in the guide is meant to go over the basic parameters of scripting.

Now, there is one thing that all scripts require in order to function, and that is a dynamic offset. The dynamic offset is a specific point in the game's memory where the script is stored for recall. This takes the form of a 6-character code preceded by ""0x"". For example, here is a nice free dynamic offset for Fire Red (the first 256 byte open space after the beginning of the ROM).

&gt;   #dynamic 0x71A300

Don't worry about having to create your own offsets because here's a handy [link](http://toolsfactory.googlecode.com/files/FreeSpaceFinder-2.0.1.0.zip) to get HackMew's FreeSpaceFinder, which automatically finds available points in the ROM for use.

Next, we have the pointers, which relay information from one point in the same script to another using the #org command. It is not important what the name of your pointer is, but if you have multiple scripters who have to know what each script is supposed to do, it's useful to have meaningful pointer names like ""@givepikachu"". However, as always, the trusty ""//"" before a line gives you comments.

So, now, we'll have a script that looks something like this:
&gt;    #dynamic 0x71A300

&gt;    #org @start

Now, if we want to lock the player and the NPC that he or she is communicating with — for the sake of this guide, let's just say he's not reading a sign (for now) — we'll use the ""faceplayer"" and ""lock"" commands. However, ""lock"" must be paired with a ""release"" command, all before the ""end"" command is used.

Let's make our friendly NPC tell our hero/heroine that Prof. Oak's house is north of here.

&gt;    #dynamic 0x71A300

&gt;    #org @start

&gt;    faceplayer

&gt;    lock

&gt;    msgbox @profoaknorth 0x6

&gt;    release

&gt;    end

&gt;    #org @profoaknorth

&gt;    = Hey, [hero]! Prof. Oak's house is\nnorth of here!

That was a lot of information to throw at you, but that's how characters talk. The ""msgbox"" command initiates the speech command, the pointer tells the script where to fetch the text from, and the offset tells the script what kind of language it's using. 0x6 is normal speech. 0x5 is a yes/no question (we'll get more into this later). 0x4 is a text box that closes when a button is pushed. 0x3 is for signs. 0x2 is  for people as well, but with the special attribute of not having to use ""lock"", ""faceplayer"" or ""release"" commands. Hooray!

In the text, I used [hero], which inserts the hero's name into that spot. Also, \n shows the first line break. After the first line break, \l must be used. \p will be used when you want the next text to be shown in a new text box, and that's that. Also [rival] can be used for your rival's name.

Now, that's all for this installment, but come back later and you might see new pieces of the guide stapled onto the subreddit sidebar!",,False,,t5_2t5aw,False,,,True,t3_r11s1,http://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonROMhacks/comments/r11s1/youlistenings_comprehensive_xse_scripting_guide/,

I would just like to say I have been fascinated by the entire idea of taking a pokemon game such as Firered,Leafgreen, and sapphire and turning them into a new type of pokemon game that would be fun, in depth, and full of fun things to do. Right now I am short of staff and would like to add some people to the team to help create Pokemon: Veil of Shadows. An ambitious brand new pokemon region with new pokemon, new enemies, and new things to discover!

Basic overview of the project:
The player recently moved to the Alvena region where the journey begins as the player sets out to become a pokemon master. The player soon find out a sinister plot brewing by Team Infiniti (cwutididthar?) that could change the fate of the entire Alvena region. Along the way many different sites are still waiting to be discovered along with some new pokemon. 
Note: I am trying to keep the story as vague as possible because it IS in its alpha stages, and can change quickly.

Spots that need filled:
I need a couple of staff to help me out the positions are as follows

Graphics Artist- For designing new pokemon, the title screen, and new gym leader designs

Cartographer - Someone skilled with designing fluid and adventurous pokemon maps that will leave a lot to be discovered, must be knowledgable with using advancemap

Beta Testers - People to test out the game itself, finding bugs and helping fix them.

Note: Most staff will need the tools that they will be working with.

Application:
Nickname?
Position applying for?
Time zone and hours available to help?
Skype (required for communication purposes)?
A little bit about yourself
And a brief example of the position you are applying for. Ex: if you are applying to be a scripter, show that you are fully knowledgable in some of the advance scripting need for the game)
NOTE: Anybody not registered that wants to help contact me via skype at grineer996
ANOTHER NOTE: Spots are getting filled, so if you still want to help let me know before its too late!

He is making Kilos and I am making Humorons.

All pokemon will be catchable in these games.

We might support Trading and LAN gameplays eventually.

Starters = Elekid, Magby, Azurill, and Seedot (yes we know they aren't like the normal starters)

We decided to have the starters different then other games because we will have you able to catch ALL 500+ pokemon from all the series, so we decided that we give you some common pokemon to use as the starters.

Gyms: Gyms will not be used for the traditional uses we will have something like earning money or getting special pokemon from the gym leaders so you won't need them to continue the story.

Regions = Kilos *Athis* Humorons *Skelos*
We will have two different regions for both games but you will be able to go to each region.

This is set after you beat the game, when your mom asks whether the news reporter said RED (Latias) or BLUE (Latios). I've found the location of Latias easily enough (0x161bb8), but Latios is evading me somehow. Please bear with me, as I'm really not certain how to decompile the code or anything -- I mostly deal in hex editors.

The typical event pokemon is just its dex number -- 0x9701 for Latias, for example. However, I've replaced all instances of 0x9801 (Latios's number) in the game, and it still spawns Latios.

I then thought maybe it was just some modification based on Latias's number (+1 for example), but changing the number of Latias to any other pokemon doesn't seem to affect Latios at all.

Of note are the few bytes after Latias's location: 0x3A4801. If you try changing the 0x34 or 0x48, the game freezes or resets when BLUE is selected. If, however, you change that 0x01 (to 0x02, for example), choosing BLUE makes a wild Latias appear instead of Latios. Furthermore, changing Latias's value still makes a Latias appear for BLUE when you do this, so it's not tied to Latias's value at all.

Can anyone offer some help on this? I assume it has to do with the ASM instructions after Latias (around 0x161bbc), but I'm not sure how to check myself. :(",,False,,t5_2t5aw,False,,,True,t3_1dyrja,http://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonROMhacks/comments/1dyrja/emerald_trouble_locating_the_address_for/,
1367938622.0,9,self.PokemonROMhacks,1dv4l4,"[X-post from pokefake] Rudimentary game plot idea, setting idea and a few fakemon.",12,3,34,http://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonROMhacks/comments/1dv4l4/xpost_from_pokefake_rudimentary_game_plot_idea/,"[I was told to post this here, if it doesn't fit in here, please notify me]

About pokemon open and closed:

Hypothetical game design has been a hobby of mine for a while: [1] /r/lolchampconcepts and [2] NEMEP, to name two, have been sources of great enjoyment to me for a long time now! That's why when I stumbled upon this subreddit, I got the idea to ""hypothesize"" my own pokemon game. Feel free to contribute ideas and criticize! I expect myself to fail, Especially when it comes to wording and structuring the whole thing.

Well then, I'll start to explain my ideas

Summary of plot idea:

Both games have a somewhat opposed message: pokemon open is about that information should be shared, and pokemon closed is about that privacy should be kept. Hence the names. In order to be capable of telling this story, a 20-years-future sort of setting has been picked, and technology has been developed that allows humans to be put into capsules just like pokemon. This doesn't quite allow for catching humans, but in each game, a different use is found: In pokemon open, humans can be healed to perfect health, like pokemon. In pokemon closed, humans can be transported through the PC system, like pokemon. However, in both cases, there's a catch: The perfect healing system is horrifyingly expensive. The transport system is free, but it reads your mind. Both brought in a somewhat ""that's not how stuff would go down IRL""-fashion, of course, since it's bloody pokemon. Another difference between the games would be the roles of mister oppan and mister dichson: dichson is the corporate fat cat in pokemon open, and oppan is the semi-terrorist protest leader, and vice-versa in pokemon closed. That's to really make clear the games are different, and to symbolize the contrast between the presented ideologies. In both cases, you will at first battle the protestors who will be doing douchey things like raiding research facilities and messing with cabling, but in the end the leader will make it clear the corporate fat cat is a way bigger asshat, and for the first time in pokemon you join the team whateverios! You eventually get to fight the corporate fat cat, he bets his evil business he will win, you win, he doesn't go through with the bet and kicks you out the door. Some media uproar later, after team whateverios helped you get the pokemon of openness/secrecy in order to fight dichson/oppan, you face him again for the 8th gym, and this time he promises to keep his word. However, the guy has a trick up his sleeve! A legendary pokemon! Of openness/secrecy! But you win anyway. 

Setting:

An region with huge futuristic cities in the middle of huge swathes of undeveloped land. The cities are legitimately enormous, with the first gym badge doubling as a pass to leave the city: in this region, 1 starter isn't enough to let a kid out into the wild on his own: It's a bit more of an actual wilderness in these games.

Fakemon:

Of course, otherwise it wouldn't make sense to post it here, would it?

Grass starters:

Every grass starter has been somehow based on ancient animals! My grass starters are based on the evolution from feathered dinosaur to flying dinosaur!

/#001 Seether (seed+feather)

Grass

overgrowth / dw: solar power

A cute little dinosaur pokemon with a nut for a head and a few pretty feather-like leaves.

/#002 Dinosoar (dinosaur + soar)

Grass/flying

overgrowth / dw: solar power

A microraptor-like pokemon with feathery wings on his hind and back legs, that soars from tree to tree.

/#003 Flyliage (fly + foliage)

Grass/flying

overgrowth / dw: solar power

A big feathered dinosaur that can fly. Mostly green.

Fire starters:

Chinese zodiac animals? Well, we've had the farm animals, there's already plenty of snakes, but what do we not have? ninja rabbits.

/#004 Bunneak (bunny + sneak)

Fire

Blaze / dw: illusion

A bunny, with black/red colors. Still cute, but definitely a few ninja vibes. Flame-like bunny tail.

/#005 Shinobbit (Shinobi + rabbit)

Fire/dark

Blaze / dw: illusion

A rabbit, this time standing upright and with shuriken patterns and and all sorts of other ninja stuff, but keeping the red/black color scheme and flame-like bunny tail. Of course, like most other fire starters mid-stage, it kinda looks like it's a teenager that thinks he's the shit.

/#006 Harekness (Hare + darkness)

Fire/dark

Blaze / dw: illusion

A hare, standing upright and far taller than shinobbit, but hardly any wider. nearly no red left with all the black, except for some stripes and the flame-like bunny tail.

Water starters:

Amphibious animals? huh? crabs get on land. and they grab things. You know what else grab things? WRESTLERS! that's right, WRESTLING CRABS.

/#007 Pinchy (Semi-diminutive of pinch by adding -y, sounds a bit like puny)

Water

Torrent / dw: arena trap

Tiny puny pinching crab. But it looks determined underneath it's cuteness!

/#008 Crasp (crab+grasp)

Water/fighting

Torrent / dw: arena trap

Now a pretty damn big crab, but not huge. Large pinchers! It totally knows it's badass, too. Already some pro-wrestler patterns and all that.

/#009 Pinslam (pincer+slam)

Water/fighting

Torrent / dw: arena trap

HUGE crab. Like, car-sized. And it's pincers are bloody huge too. And it's got badass wrestler patterns and all that.

GENERIC NORMAL POKEMON:

Generic normal pokemon, yeahhhhhh.

Actually no. It might be a stray cat, but it's a stray cat that evolves into either a GENTLEMAN ADVENTURER or a AVIATOR depending on it's gender.

/#010 Purroam (pur + roam.)

normal

run away / dw: adaptability

A stray cat, that really looks like one too: unkempt fur, scars in ears, etc. But still cute, if in a somewhat hobo-like manner.

/#011 Gentventure (gentleman + adventure) Evolves from a male purroam leveled up in a non-urban enviroment.

normal 

Adventurous (Gains a secondary typing and increased speed during weather, with befitting appearance changes) / dw: adaptability

An adventurous gentleman cat, that walks upright with a cane and wears a variety of different hats depending on the weather, usually a bowler hat. Has a mustache.

/#012 Ladyiator (lady + aviator) Evolves from a female purroam leveled up in a non-urban enviroment.

flying / normal (adventurous affects the secondary typing, hence the primary flying type.)

Adventurous / dw: adaptability

An aviator lady cat, that also walks upright and wears and aviator cap and goggles. Has flying-squirrel style skin folds to fly with. Normal cat whiskers, not mustache.

/#013 to /#015 slots are reserved for urban bird pokemon, which I currently have 0 ideas for :(.

Bugs:

Bugs that evolved to look like stuff in the city!

/#016 Larfalt (Larval + asphalt)

bug/ground

adaptability / shield dust / dw: solid rock

A grey-black caterpillar with a pattern that makes it looks like asphalt: Loads of insects mimic their enviroment, this one does it in the city!

/#017 Bricocoon (brick + cocoon)

Bug/ground

adaptability / shed skin / dw: solid rock

Basically a brick with pokemon eyes. Cocoons don't move, bricks don't move, look a little like one and bam! Perfect camouflage. Note: boring design

/#018 fragilile (fragile + something, idk. credit to EBDelt)

Bug/ground

adaptability / compoundeyes / dw: levitate

It's a glass butterfly pokemon! So, so pretty. This thing's always camouflaged: even on windows!

Opinions? Also, info on my rom hack below.

A basic synopsis of Pokemon MysticArelian Version:
*Is set in a new region named Junnin, with +80 new Pokemon. The region is somewhat influenced by Australia.
*The professor's name is Pine, who works in a rain forest bio-dome/laboratory combo and studies Pokemon ecology. Instead of the hero/herione and their rival getting their starter Pokemon from Pokeballs, they instead have hatched from Pokemon eggs and start out at level 1.
*The three starter Pokemon are the Small-Leaf Pokemon Eucuwala (A highly social green koala bear Pokemon, with physical orientated stats), the Swinging Pokemon Kindlemur (An agile lemur Pokemon, with speed orientated stats), and the Fin Pokemon Dimetrus (An aquatic dimetrodon Pokemon, with defensive orientated stats). 
*The main villainous team of the region is named Team Zodiac, and aside from grunts, spies, and scientists, is split into 12 sub-admins based off of the western zodiac and a main admin, based and named after Ophiuchus. They are after the legendary Pokemon Orakey, said to hold all of the answers to the universe. The sub-admins appearances, personalities, and type speciality (if any) are based off of their respective zodiacs. For example, Sub-Admin(s) Pisces are actually male/female twins, specialize in Water and Ice type Pokemon, and have a bad habit of interrupting each other.

The concept of Junnin, Professor Pine, and the starter Pokemon is credited to the artist MagesPages. You can see his artwork here: http://imgur.com/a/mdQMp#0 (Junnin Regional Pokedex)

But now, I really want to try it. Can't figure out if I'm good at it if I'm too scared to even try, right? So I'm pitching my idea here, to see what you guys think of it.


This would be a FireRed hack, taking place in an entirely new and recently-discovered region. It would feature Pokémon from the first two generations, and would follow the journey of a new Trainer (hopefully with new sprites!), either male or female.

**PLOT**


The Player Character would be a young boy/girl from Goldenrod City who comes to this as-of-yet unnamed region to participate in the new League challenge, an intensely difficult gauntlet of Gym challenges culminating in a nigh-undefeatable Elite Four challenge followed by a nightmarish fight with the Champion of the region.

Judging by all those adjectives, one might guess that this hack would be difficult. That's my goal with this; I want it to be expansive, brutal, and above all, a blast to play. Every Pokémon, including Legendaries, would be obtainable (Many during the main story line), and it would feature both Team Rocket and a new villainous team as well, most likely sun-themed (Team Sol, maybe?). These two organizations would team up to try and dominate the world, mostly unchallenged save for you, and your rivals (Possibly only one; the rivals would be Gary/Blue and the unchosen player character, but I'm not sure how viable this would be.)

The version mascot would be Celebi.



**THE REGION**

This region's terrain would be wildly varied, enough to accommodate the first 250-ish Pokémon. Additionally, there would be many cities, Gyms, towns, and a few special areas where you could challenge some very special (and strong) Trainers to battles.


Please note that I am a novice, and this would be my first hacking experience. However, I do believe that I have the patience (some would call it stubbornness), time, and willingness to take a swing at it, as well as getting a lot of on-the-job experience. Hopefully I can create something that blows you all away!",,False,,t5_2t5aw,False,,,True,t3_15w2my,http://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonROMhacks/comments/15w2my/starting_my_first_romhack/,

Most people seem to only get espeons, I first evolved an Umbreon, and now at any time of the day (midday, morning, afternoon) my other Eevee's are still trying to evolve into Umbreon.

Does anyone know how to fix/get around this?

[EDIT] Going to leave this here, but I managed to get espeon, I raised the happiness of 2 eevees (with soothe bells) at the same time, and then tried to level one at night and one at day, but both became umbreon... So I re leveled another egg eevee at day and it became espeon.

===

**Edit 2:** This is now **solved**! KazoWAR added a real-time clock editor to their [save file editor](http://projectpokemon.org/forums/showthread.php?31254-A-Save-(3rd-Generation-Save-Editor)). I used it to reset the 2 time stamps (adventure started and time passed), and now everything works perfectly fine again. So no, you do not have to start a new game after having replaced the batteries to make your time-based events work again.

===

This is a question for all you awesome people working with ROMs. I have been trying to get my GBA games whose batteries had run dry working again. I have successfully replaced the batteries but time-based events still do not occur. While it is only mentioned rarely, the Internet says that I have to start a new game to get the time-based events working again. I suppose this is because the game turns them off once the battery dies but has no automated function to turn them on again, as replacing the battery was never part of Nintendo's plan.

Does anyone of you people who work with all kinds of stored values in the ROMs know how/where the game stores the information that time-based events do no longer occur? I have loaded my save files from my GBA cartridges to the PC and checked them, I even made saves that only differed in terms of battery-on or battery-off but when I look at the save files in hex editors and compare them, I get very confusing results. (I was hoping to get a clear result showing me which parts I need to edit to re-enable time-based events.)

When I loaded my GBA save onto the PC and loaded it in Visual Boy Advance with the clock working, I got the berry master to give me his daily berry again but only once. First I thought that saving in VBA with the clock working would solve all my problems, but berries still do not grow and the people who give you things daily only did so once after I saved in VBA.

So I thought maybe one of you experts already knows what to do in this situation. All I want to do is change the part in my save file that says whether time-based events are on or off, then load it back onto my cartridge.

I have looked in the PokéCommunity forums but there are so many threads there, not even the search function is any help. If you can't help me directly but have an idea where I could ask for help, please let me know.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

Basically, you can face Arceus Post E4. Level 100, can't capture it (although if you win you get Arceus sent to your PC with a neutral nature and perfect IVs straight across the board). You'd face it in a double battle with the Champion as your partner, all his Pokemon at level 100. Why? Well, this special Arceus you face (not the one you get) would have 250 base stats straight across the board plus a new ability called Omnipotence

Omnipotence works like Multitype, but it would also give all stats but HP a 50% boost (making the base stats essentially 375), passive healing of 1/16th max health per turn (or per every two turns?), plus immunity to damage from Hail and Sandstorm, plus immunity to all status conditions, including Flinch, Infatuation (...although being genderless it kind of already is...), and Confusion

Thing is, I'm not much of a programmer, so I got lost trying to add it. I got it somewhat working on the multitype copy part, but it acted a bit funny, allowing Soak to work while leaving the type Dragon (although I suspect that was Judgement working off the Plate instead of off of Arceus' type)

I can't even test the ability to balance it until I've got at least the basic plan running

1354665058.0,6,self.PokemonROMhacks,14ah05,XSE Tutorial 6: Money,8,2,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonROMhacks/comments/14ah05/xse_tutorial_6_money/,"Welcome back! Today's tutorial is going to cover how to give, take, and compare a player's money. This isn't going to be a PokeMart thing, there are other programs to cover that. This is where a NPC or a script will cause the player to lose or gain money.  
**What You'll Need**  
XSE (I use version 1.1.1)
 ---  
**Section 1: Give and Pay Money**  
The code that XSE uses for giving money is:  
`givemoney 0xHEX_NUMBER 0x0`  
Let's go over what it means!   


| Code | Description |  
|:--: | :-- |  
|givemoney| The code XSE uses to give a player money|  
|0xHEX_NUMBER| The amount of money, in hex, you wish to give the player.|  
|0x0| This is a buffer, you have to include it but leave it as it is.|  
Here's an example:  
`givemoney 0xA 0x0` will give the player 10 yen.  
To take money from a player is pretty much the exact same thing only instead of ""givemoney"" you'd say ""paymoney"".  
Here's an example:  
`paymoney 0xB 0x0` will take 11 yen from the player.  
  
---  
**Section 2: Check Money**  
Check money is used primarily to stop a player from being able to buy something if they don't have enough money. For example:  
    `checkmoney 0xHEX_NUMBER 0x0`  
    `compare 0x800D 0x1`  
    `if 0x4 goto @Next`  
    `msgbox @NeedMoreMoney 0x6`  
But what does this all do?  

| Code | Description |

Took matters into my own hands, and it turns out the only hard part was figuring out how to move files around.

So after patching the rom as normal (so you have the file ready to be played on VBA), and setting up GPSPhone (which of course requires a jailbreak), download [i-Funbox](http://www.i-funbox.com/) and unzip the file. Set it up without any alterations, and plug the phone in. The second tricky part is finding out where GPSPhone stores the ROMs. After a little searching, I found out you need to go to (in i-Funbox) Raw File System --&gt; private/var/mobile/Media/ROMs/GBA. And simply copy in the prepared file.

I deleted the pre-existing Fire Red file; I'm not sure if that's actually necessary or not, but I don't think it can store more than one save of Fire Red at a time. Right now I need to go to class, but in a couple hours I'll try renaming files and see if it isn't possible to have more than one hack of one kind at a time.

I wanted to make this a little more difficult than most Pokemon games I have played.The player must craft in Marts to make healing items, healing can be done in your bed or in your Aunt's house bed. I included MANY pokemon because I really like having OPTIONS in a pokemon game, considering I like doing things like 'All bug' or 'all ghost' runs of games for example.

The story is something I really hope to expand on, I encourage those who try it out to speak with everyone in the game to get a good feel of where the story is coming from. 

The 'Beta' if you can call it that is locked to an island, once you have reached the docks then you know you have gone as far as you can.

You can download the IPS patch Here:

On my current play through I'm kinda digging it and think it might make a cool hack.  

The trainer was a kid when Giratina attacked him.  His pokemon saved his life by jumping inbetween the two.  As a result the poke died and the trainer's hair turned grey.  Years later his dream is to take revenge against Giratina.  The team bad guys would be a cult that worships Giratina.  The elite four would instead be Giratina's 4 generals, the last of which would have the ghost of the trainer's old poke being controlled by them.  I'm usually opposed to fakemon, but instead of the champion, it would be Giratina and each of it's pokes would be a different form of it, like hi-powered grass/ghost, fire/ghost, water/ghost and so on, all different forms of Giratina.  The last form would be regular Giratina, only like lvl 80 or something insane like that.

If this is inappropriate, feel free to move these posts into my other thread.  The topic is sufficiently different from that in my eyes, but it's not up to me.  Anyway..

When I decided I was done hacking I was right in the middle of porting the GBA cart recognition system from the gen 4 games to the gen 5 games.(You know how you could attach a GBA cart to your DS to PalPark and change wild encounters. That.) I had it working, actually. It was hacked together badly with a bunch of AR codes for testing, but it did work.(And destroyed a few Emerald saves on me!) Anyway, what I ended up doing was coding a couple of my own script commands(written in assembly and inserted as a script command so that I can call them like normal script commands in scripts) in empty script command slots and what they would do is poll an address I chose for specific values which would change depending on which GBA game was in slot-2 on the DS. Different values would change the weather and seasons and stuff just as a test. It seemed to work fine as far as I could see. I also tried out changing encounter tables as the GBA games changed. That seemed to work fine too.

Anyway, what I'm getting at here is that, while I'm done hacking, I can show someone else how to do this. If there's anyone who knows some ARM assembly and is interested in making a hack and wants to do something neat with GBA carts, I can walk you through it. If you can write your own routine that calls other routines and insert it, that's probably enough experience. You could even make an importer for the gen 3 games so people don't have to PalPark then Poketransfer. They could connect up their GBA cart and certain pokes would be automatically converted and show up in the gen 5 games. These are just random example ideas, though.

Ok so the other idea I had was a dynamic weather system for all of Unova. There's a timer in the field data block that tracks how long you've been in a given area since you last went through a door. You could easily measure that and every x ticks(a few minutes or whatever) see if the weather should change. Changing the weather is super-easy. You would need some semi-complex code to check whether you're indoors or out, what season it is(so you give the right weather based on temp and such), to grab from the right weather list, etc etc. Then you could count vframes to see how long the weather should run with a random number thrown in to make it a little unpredictable. Something like 300 vframes(5 min) - rand(120) vframes which would run the weather anywhere from 3-5 minutes. That's just an example though.

Long story short, it's definitely possible and in my mind, not that difficult for someone without much experience. It also has a lot of possibility for making the world feel more alive. And like the last one, if you know some ARM and think this is something you might be interested in, let me know.

You start off among the lowest and weakest pokemon trainers, grinding every day hoping to become stronger. You're in the lowest division and the first 'gym leader' is the current defending champ and badges are replaced with belts or trophies. Once you claim the championship belt you move up to the next division/league, sort of like when MMA fighters move from Strikeforce to UFC. There will be eight different leagues and lots of fights, you might even amass a fanbase.

You're probably thinking that this is too shallow to be a full hack but there would be another story happening side by side, perhaps the evil team is participating and as they become more popular they convince people to fight for their cause.

I am in the initial planning stage of creating my own pokemon game. I came up with the ideas in the comment section on someone's theory on /r/pokemonconspiracies. I am just going to copy and paste my original comments. I'm not doing this to be lazy, I just want my original thoughts to be posted, so you can see the real development, and not just the summarized conclusion of it. Quoted, bolded text are other user's comments, not mine.

______________________________________________________________________________________________

Come to think of it, they should make a new region, only the this one based off of South America.

&gt; **Hoenn has a pretty ""south american"" type climate.**

Yes, somewhat. but Hoenn is still based off of Japan, isn't it? I mean like a region with rainforests and maybe even some aboriginals. One of the subplots could involve Mew.

You would start the game as a young boy/ girl who moved to the region (I'm just going to call it Region X for now) with your uncle, who happens to be the smart, yet absent minded Professor Genipa. Genipa came to Region X because he has learned that Mew DNA has been found here. You came with him to start your journey as a Pokemon trainer.

Of course, your main objective is to beat the 8 gyms, and eventually the Elite Four. But along the way, you encounter Team Rocket. This isn't the same Team Rocket Red faced years ago, but rather a revival of the group lead by someone other than Giovanni. This Team Rocket came to X to once again clone Mew, attempting Mewthree. There will be another villainous team, and from here on they will be referred to as Team Y. I'm not sure on what Team Y's motives will be, but they will be against both you and Team Rocket. Team Y will also be an aboriginal group.

&gt; **10/10 would buy. You should look into rom hacking. As cheesy as rom hacks are..**

I would rom hack, but I'm so bad at computers, its not even funny. I guess for now I can create the Pokemon for Region X, actually name Region X, name Team Y, and give Team Y a story.
I think I'll call the region Gyoka.

The grass starter will be some sort of gorilla pokemon. The fully evolved one will be Grass/Fighting. I'm not sure about the water and fire starters yet.

One Pokemon will be Bozbig. It'll be a grass and fighting type as well, but it look similar to a snake. An aspect of Bozbig will be that it is incredibly sneaky, and it camoflages. It won't camouflage in the vein of Kecleon, but it will use nature to camouflage, ie hiding under leaves. If you haven't already figured it out, Bozbig is a homage to Big Boss, or Naked Snake, from Metal Gear Solid 3.
The game will take place about 10 years after the Johto journey. After the Elite Four are defeated, you can find Gold, the protagonist from gen II, in the vein of finding Red in gen II. Gold will have a different role than Red: He will actually talk. He'll point out a reference to him battling Red years ago, and after you beat him, he will explain something previously unknown in the game, probably something referring to Mewthree, or something.

The white inhabitants of Gyoka will not be natives, of course. Remember the SS Anne from gen I? The SS Anne goes to Gyoka on its annual trip. Some people from Kanto stay in Gyoka, possibly because they enjoy the weather more, or they missed the boat before it left. Some people will be vacationers from other regions, as well.

Similar to Kanto's towns being named after colours, and Johto's after plants, Gyoka's towns will be named after movies, Tv series, and games set in South America, or other jungle settings. One town will be Melgeer, which would be derived from Metal Gear. Of course in that town you'll be able to catch Bozbig. (Speaking of Bozbig, I am planning another Metal Gear based Pokemon. I haven't figured out a name, but it'll be based off of Raiden from MGS2. It will evolve into Raiden from MGS4 and MGRising. The first one will be a fighting type, and the second will be electric fighting. Or maybe it should be steel electroc. I don't know. I'll ask /r/metalgearsolid.)

Perhaps after the Elite Four are defeated, and the story of the game is completed, you will be able to take the SS Anne to Kanto, and maybe even go to Johto. Hoenn, even.

_______________________________________________________________________________________________

**Update**: Another Metal Gear reference. I know, I know, I'm going overboard with these Metal Gear Solid cameos. I promise this will be the last reference.  In Melgeer, there will be an NPC named Snake. If you talk to him, he'll say he's on a sneaking mission, and not to bother him. He will then mutter under his breath that a cardboard box would be useful. You here this, and you give him a box you find in another town. Upon giving the box to him, an exclamation mark will appear over his head, Metal Gear style. Snake will thank you, and give you something for your troubles. Maybe a TM, or a rare candy, I don't know yet.

Maybe Bozbig and the Raiden-based pokemon will be legendaries. Im jot sure exactly what I'm doing with them yet, but I do know they will be male pokemon.  I will create a pokedex entry for Bozbig, and ill resume Raiden's development. I'll keep you guys up to date.

________________________________________________________________________________________________

**Update** MGS2 Raiden should be just a Fighting type, and MGS4 Raiden a Fighting/Steel and he can learn Electric type moves. 

_________________________________________________________________________________________________

**Update** Help wanted. Spriters, programmers, concept artists, I'll pretty much accept any help.

Also, the game will be called Pokemon: Gyoka, at least until I find a better name.

________________________________________________________________________________________________

**Update**: When you battle Gold, what should his pokemon be? He will have the red Gyarados, for sure. Should he have the fully evolved starters? Red had a Snorlax. Sudowoodo is the same thing, a road block. Gold will have a Sudowoodo, too. Oh, Togepi. How could I forget that little fucker. I guess it would be a Togechick. I mean, little Togepi is no threat at all. Eevee? It would be an Umbreon, because Red had an Espeon, didnt he?

Need some help!,10,2,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonROMhacks/comments/w05ps/beginning_hacker_here_need_some_help/,"Me and my friend decided we wanted to make a ROM hack about the Hoenn region before it was discovered. We were wondering if anyone knew of any programs that did the following (we already have the basics like advmap, admart etc):

1. Redesign a trainer/gym leader's pokemon. We want to make the gym leaders all have tribal paintings and patterns on their pokemon to distinguish them from the other pokemon. Also could we nickname them? we want to keep the same pokemon (We're going to make a story about the generations being passed down from father to son, mother to daughter and so on).

2. Redesign the sprites of the characters. We want to give everyone a tribal-like look (native American / native African).

3. We're having a problem with advancemap where we cannot use til sets from other towns for different towns. We want to use the pacifidlog and fortree huts for many of the towns, but we just can't get them to show up for the other towns. Also for the inside of buildings, we are stuck with the default tile set. is there any way to change this or any other program that could do this?

4. We want to make the pokemart guy the same person as the nurse. It would be one person in one hut. Is there any program to do this? We want to make it a shaman, and I suppose there could be two, but one would be better. You would talk to him and he would ask if you would like your pokemon healed or if you would like to buy/sell something. 

5. This one is kind of complicated and unnecessary, but it would add to the effect that we're trying to achieve. We would like to change the description of an item, and also change what it does. For example, We would like the Exp. share to have a different graphic (a stone bracelet) and be able to double the experience and split it (so instead of one pokemon getting 100 exp, or two gettign 50, they would both get 100).

I will probably add some later, but if you could help with any of these, it would be a tremendous help! Thanks for checking it out!",,False,,t5_2t5aw,False,,,True,t3_w05ps,http://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonROMhacks/comments/w05ps/beginning_hacker_here_need_some_help/,

It's just way over my head! But I have fantastic ideas! Here is my foremost:

-Pokemon: Mens Sana
--A lab-created Pokemon inspired by Mewtwo himself has escaped. This Pokemon has proven stronger and smarter than Mewtwo, or at least, Mewtwo as recorded by his creators. You have been raised on Mewtwo's island of Elysium, and recently reached the age of 13, at which point most of your people make their choice- stay and become Pokemon Trainers on Elysium, or leave and become Pokemon Trainers on your own. You will leave, on the mission to prevent humanity from suffering the wrath of Praetium, the Perfect Form, in its bloodlust against humans. You choose your Elysian Starter- Felign, a fire-type cat Pokemon which will become fire-dark, Solseed, a grass-type Pokemon of a unique, humanoid appearance which will become grass-steel, or Asqula, a water-type skeletal-quadruped Pokemon which will become water-ghost. As you advance, your goal will be to get to the Pokemon Champion, a fellow Elysian, and to have him help you catch the legendary Elligy, the Ghost of Elysium, for which Elysium was named because when Elysium was almost sunk, it used its psychic powers to save Elysium from sinking, but at the cost of its very sanity.  You will encounter Praetium at least twice, and each time be completely outmatched by it, and at your last encounter, after mending Elligy's mind, you will be able to defeat Praetium, and have the choice to defeat it, catch it, or talk it down and allow it to find peace at Elysium, with Mewtwo.

There are others, this was actually a revision of an old idea of mine in which Mewtwo goes on a rampage, so you return to the facility in which he was cloned and take one of the cloned starters from the First Movie and raise it to be strong enough to defeat Mewtwo, thus ending Mewtwo's rampage. I also have one in which the Pokemon Champion of a region wants to let one of the Team Rocket equivalents take it over, and one in which you are a member of Team Rocket trying to overthrow Giovanni.

- Placing more trainers in the world, for extra training.
- Making trainers, rivals, leaders stronger than you a majority of the time, for even more training.
- The ability to re-battle your rival and gym leaders after the Elite 4.
- A second region to explore (Probably not a good idea, but something like a large offshore island would work too.)
- A trainer that is strongest trainer in the game, with level 80-90 pokémon. Essentially like Red in GSC.
- I would like a yes or no on 4th gen Pokémon.

Due to this being my first rom hack, and because working with RSE roms seems much more difficult than FR/LG ones, I have officially decided to move this over to being a FireRed project. In a sense, i have given up on an Emerald hack, and i'm not ashamed to admit it. Hopefully this doesn't change anybody's overall view of the project :)

So this is my first ever rom hack, and i've decided on the name Shining Jade. This post will have 2 parts: a Confirmed section, and a Suggestions section. Confirmed is just all of the things that are for sure going into the game. Suggestions are things I am asking my fellow redditors for their opinions about.

**Confirmed**

* You and your best friends, Barry and Andria, all go and receive your first Pokemon, and instantly the rivalry begins. Barry wants a battle with you, and you accept. After battling you, he immediately turns to face Andria. After losing to her, Barry becomes very angry and storms out of the Lab. As you work your way through the gyms and the game, you come to learn that Barry has joined Team (still thinking of a name), and is dedicated to becoming stronger to beat you and Andria. What Barry doesn't know is that Team (?) is only training with him to use him. Jirachi awakens once every 1,000 years, and the next recorded date for it to awaken is very near. Barry's secret purpose is to capture Jirachi, only to have Team (?) use it for their own malicious purposes. But Jirachi is just the start of their plan; Celebi is next. Team (?) figures that by controlling Celebi, they will be able to change the past so that they can rule over the entire Enora region. Fed up with becoming stronger, Barry doesn't realize his mistakes until it comes time to capture Celebi. You and Andria are the only ones who can convince him what is still right...

* Starters: Bagon, Larvitar, and Beldum
* The region the game takes place in is Enora, and it is still an 8-gym/Elite Four type of game.

**Suggestions**

(Nothing here as of right now)

Everybody is allowed to comment on anything here, as well as ask questions. Even thought there is a section dedicated to suggestions, i accept all feedback, even if it is for something in the confirmed section.

Before anyone says 'google it' I have, extensively, and I can't find anything that helps.

So, I decided I wanted to play a few different roms and various hacks. I read ROM Hacks 101, using the VBA download link found there. I followed the instructions exactly for setting up my game, but I just got a white screen, when pressing L and R buttons(a and s in VBA), I could hear sounds. 

Upon looking into it further, I noticed that my association types weren't staying. I selected .gba, .gb and .gbc. When I went back and looked at the association types again, none were checked. I'm not sure why they aren't saving or how to get them to stay selected.

I tried running it with Pokemon Fire Red - Toxic Purple and Pokemon Ruby - Snakewood. I got sounds while pressing L and R with Toxic Purple, and I got nothing with Snakewood.

If anyone has any idea how to get the association types to stay selected, that would be amazing.

Thanks in advance,

~Witty

Today's topic covers items, specifically the ones you find on the ground and the kind that people give to you. Let's start with the ones you find.  
**What you'll need**  
Advance Map 1.92  
XSE (I use version 1.1.1)
 ---  
**Section 1: The Code**  
The code XSE uses for items is:  
`giveitem 0xHEX 0xQUANTITY MSG_FIND`  
Let's run through what these mean:  


| Code | Description |  
|:--: | :-- |
|giveitem|This is what tells XSE you want to give the player an item.|  
|0xHEX| This is the hex code of the item you'll be giving. A complete list of hex codes for Fire Red can be found [(in the video description) here.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nP_JPGznDS8)|  
|0xQUANTITY| This is how many of the item you'll be giving.|  
|MSG_FIND| This is what tells the game to show the ""My_name got an item"" kind of message and sound, just keep this the way it is.|  
Here's an example:  
    `#dynamic 0x800000`  
    `#org @main`  
    `giveitem 0x136 0x1 MSG_FIND`  
    `release`  
    `end`  
That's it for the code but we're not done yet! When you place the Pokeball icon (or whatever you choose to denote an item) you have to assign it a unique Person ID in Advance Map [like so.](http://i50.tinypic.com/15yhmvk.png)  This is what causes the Pokeball to disappear forever after you obtain your item!  

---  
**Section 2: NPC Giving Items**  
When a NPC gives you an item you're going to use the exact same code as above except instead of MSG_FIND you'll be using MSG_OBTAIN. You also do not need to worry about a Person ID in this case. The code in the example doesn't come with any messages so you'll have to use the knowledge you have from past tutorials about message boxes to give the NPC something to say! Remember, normally you only want an NPC to give you an item once! How would we do that? The answer is with [flags](http://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonROMhacks/comments/vx9ji/xse_tutorial_2_give_pok%C3%A9mon_and_flags_part_1/)! 

---  
**Section 3: The Challenge**  
Your challenge for this tutorial is to write the code that will have a NPC give you an Old Rod, but only once! Good luck!

I had to stop my Let's Play after the first gym to take a break and start fixing the damn thing (My Trapinch learned Psybeam, for starters. Hilarious and I'm running with it, but still)

So first off:

Considering it has things like Groudon learning Splash 4 times, Cradily evolving into Anorith, Armaldo and possibly others replaced with Eevees, warps which lead to elsewhere and require fixing to even be able to advance the game, and so on, is there by any chance an already repaired version of this game?

If not, how the heck would I go about making a patch so others can play a fixed version? And what should I be on the look out for when fixing this buggy mess?

...Seriously, how did this happen? I can sort of get why the starters might be adjusted to only struggle, but only everything after Celebi goes to hell (by the way, I've learned that a Pokemon with no attacks borrows the moves of the Pokemon right after it).

I already have the story blocked out, and a few quick drafts of sprites (although I'm far from an artist).

But other than this, I hardly know where to start. I am relatively computer literate, and have messed around in a variety of languages, so I'm hoping this will help me.

So far I have downloaded AdvanceMap, Yape, XSE, free space finder and an appropriate ROM. What else do I need?

If it helps, I want to insert my own sprites, remove some of the original sprites/pokemon. I am looking at creating all new pokemon/evolutions/pokedex entries (although a quick glance through YAPE seems to offer all of this except images so how do I insert them?) I want to create an all new top-down map, which apparently advancemap has problems with, will I need to create the artwork for that myself in an extra program?

Also, how easy is it to make a new HM? I have found plenty that lets me rearrange moves, and change who can learn what, but nothing that really lets me create moves from scratch, especially ones that can be used in the overworld.

I am also looking at changing the introduction video, and if possible, changing the music slightly.

It has a darker tone to it, and I like the idea of the main character building a team to take down an already-in-control Team Rocket. 

As much as I liked this concept, the story seemed incomplete, which is odd because the ROM itself *was* complete (or so I think). I know it was really just an elaborate marriage proposal, but I think the dialogue could have been better. So here's my idea.

I would like to remake it. Well, remake isn't the right word. I just want to use the concept. I probably wouldn't have the six little bases with Hoenn pokemon in them, although I'm not opposed to having Hoenn Poke's in the game somewhere. I also won't copy any dialogue from Turquoise, I'm not *that* guy. 

The only part I would sort of copy is the fact that your rival is friendly, and you sort of team up in defeating Team Rocket. I like that concept, along with the idea that Rival's life get directly impacted by Team Rocket, so I might use that. 

I just think it would be cool if I made a hack where you and your rival are chosen by Oak to build a team that could contest, and eventually bring down, Team Rocket's tyranny across Kanto.

Here's my problem:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have almost *NO* experience with hacking, and it could be a while before I'm any good at it. I have been researching it over the past couple of days and have downloaded all of the necessary software to make the hack, so I can do some things.

My solution to my lack of experience is to make a really basic hack that is basically changed dialogue with some extra battles here and there, maybe some events. That would be my first beta. Then, as my experience with hacking grows, I would add some more complex events, perhaps some secret Rocket hideouts, the ideas are only limited by my imagination...and yours. This would keep up until we've built one big hack with a more complete ""dark"" storyline.

What do you guys think? I'm going to need some help, but it you guys would like to see it, I'm willing to give it a shot.

**TL;DR:** Played Turquoise. Thought the story was incomplete. Would like to remake the concept despite my lack of hacking experience. Thoughts?

*The Plot*

They finally did it! Professor Birch and the scientists in his lab finally tracked down the coordinates for unique Pokemon! *(can either be Fakemon or Fusions from [here](http://pokemon.alexonsager.net/)) (yes, I took inspiration from [Pokemon Stardrop](http://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?t=242257) in the Hackdex.)* Though, on the way on meeting this new Pokemon, Professor Birch trips and is encountered by a Zigzagoon. Suddenly (blah blah blah RSE plot) Brendan/May come to the rescue and send out Birch's ferocious Pokemon. Birch is scratched all over and has to be taken home for hospitality. Mesmerized at Brendan/May's performance, Prof. Birch says Brendan/May is deemed the one to catch the unique Pokemon, (the rival gets jealous) but in order for the Pokemon to appear, the Trainer needs to beat the Hoenn Champion, since the Champion is the one who had created the prized Pokemon in the first place. 

This was a bit long...sorry, today my creative juices were flowing.

**TL;DR:** NEW LEGENDARY FAKEMON/FUSION YAYYYY, Professor Birch sucks and is hospitalised, a FRIGGIN TEN year old finds the new Pokemon.

A few lines/bits of dialogue I just made up throughout the process of writing this is in the comments.

I was thinking that all stat changing moves are permanent, but obviously some balancing needs to happen: 

In RSE the player has quick access to wingull at levels 5-7 so make Mist available right then because it clears stat changes. I was thinking the core starter types could have two tiers of stat clearing moves, one early on and just for that one pokemon, and one in later levels that clears for everyone in the party. 

OR

 Without altering any moves, rescript X items and such so that they can be used outside of battle but only the amount needed to even out a stat change. 

Pros

New importance of X items, move sets, and abilities (Keen Eye, Clear Body, Speed Boost, Battle Armor, Contrary, Magic Bounce, Hyper Cutter, etc.
More strategic depth in team building in regards to offense vs defense 
Battles that take more attempts could spike in difficulty or become easier


Cons

All stat changes have to be visible like in pokemon showdown, so a new battle screen would have to be made.
Lots of work to script and balance.
Players could abuse and return to easier areas and boost theirs stats off of weak Pokemon.
Boxing Pokemon and healing Pokemon cannot reset stats.
Could get insanely difficult.

- I'm switching over to Ruby, seeing as some of the better hacks I've played have been Ruby base. 
- Title will be Pokemon Lithium Edition. Not a version like the mass majority of hacks and official games. 
- Region name will be Asperia.
- The mascot will be Raikou. Because I really like Raikou. The plot will be based around Raikou, and I have been writing some things in my free time. 
- The ""evil"" villains will be known as Team Blackwood.
There will be a second region in the after game, seeing as I enjoyed having a second region in LP and in the Johto hacks.
- Trainers will be stronger so the game wont be easy like officials. 
- You will have a single rival, and he will challenge you after every 3 gyms or so, and he will appear in major points of the game. 
- All 386 Pokemon will have HGSS sprites, seeing as they are better quality. (this may happen, still not a definite.)
- New music will be added. Maybe the rival battle theme will remix for the league champion. Seeing as I like it so much. (This probably not possible but I will stamp out the issue if this cant be added)  http://m.youtube.com/#/watch?v=6L87BMk_Q5Q&amp;desktop_uri=%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D6L87BMk_Q5Q

Right now iv got:

 * Garchomp - Starter, very usefull in pretty much all situations because of his dragon typing. Ground helps because its got a lot of immunities.

 * Breloom - Weird choice, but I like having Spore and awesome fighting moves on the same pokemon. He saves my ass with spore a lot.

 * Empoleon - Wall. He resists pretty much everything, and he can easily take hits while I heal everyone else. Hes got Scald already and its awesome. I cant wait to get Ice Beam on him, bcus he will be a dragon eating machine.

 * Houndoom - Awesome when its not raining, but im getting really annoyed that she has yet to learn a fire move better than ember. Level 48 has come and gone, and still no sign of flamethrower or firefang or ANYTHING. Does anyone know if its glitched or something? I am seriously considering switching her out for the Victini because her fire utility is so crippled.

The other pokemon im thinking of adding if 4 gets to be too hard, are Drifblim (for flying/ghost :P) and some electric type. Probably Galvantula.

I'm great with stories, characters, dialogues, events, Gyms, Teams, and ideas in general, but editing sprites/maps and actually adding everything to the game is difficult.

I am working on a FireRed hack, set in Kanto. You are Silver, Giovanni's son. He had no interest in raising you, but now you've come to him from Johto to prove yourself. At first your only goal is to become an adept Trainer worthy of his respect, but as you wander around the region you begin to uncover a plot that involves the Legendary Bird Trio, Mew and Mewtwo, and several other Indigo League tidbits.

You have two rivals. One is Gary Oak, who is also setting out to prove himself, and the other is Ash Ketchum, who is trying to stop you. Along the way you will bully, lie, and steal your way through Kanto on your quest first to defeat everyone in it, then to gather the Trio, then to capture the elusive genetic experiment that got away.

All Pokemon are first gen. Instead of Shinies, you have a 3-5% chance of encountering the Pokemon of the area in a corrupt ""experiment"" form, due to Team Rocket's dabbling in Pokemon genetics.

Obviously there is a lot more to it. I suppose what I'm looking for is a collaborator, someone to work with and bounce ideas off of, and someone who can help me actually bring this thing to life. I can recolor just fine, but I need someone to help edit the map a little bit, etc.

I was almost done, I simply request two small things.

1) Skylax: I followed the item trail to Don Carne, got the Tumor thing, forced a poor ditto to have sex with it and have its baby, hatched the baby (no small feat, for those of you who have yet to do so), traded it to the chef, and nursed that goddam munchlax with a soothe bell until my game broke. All I'm asking is a pic of the pokemon as well as stats, and maybe a possible movepool

2)Clockwork Orange: I was sooooo pumped to see this guy; I had just finished reading the book, so I still had that, ""OMG luv that book."" phase going. I got the orange, saw the ursaring sprite, went to see it.... and crash. The game would freeze, the image would become a negative, and it would crash. I had been dedicated and used few save states, so my closest one to that point was from before I received the Toxicroak; which was too far for me. So I shelved the game for a later date, only to have it cruelly swept away, with no back-up in site. Same request as for the Skylax


I'm asking bc I know it's the hotm, but i'm very busy and in the middle of the ruby destiny series, and don't want to play through that whole goddam game for 2 pokemon.
