Alright, I'd enjoy redesigning my room. Here are a few pictures to give you a ""feel"" for the size of the room and design.

* This is the view from my door. [[Picture 1]](http://imgur.com/3dffv)
* This is the view from the alcove to the left. [[Picture 2]](http://imgur.com/tx39H)
* This is the view from the bed into the alcove. I do not use this television for anything (it doesn't even have cable). There is a sewing kit, since I've been trying my hand at sewing. But there's also some free space above it. [[Picture 3]](http://imgur.com/G8G1F)
* This is my closet. It only includes my shirts and dress things (shirts on the shelf thing, dress things on the hangers (mostly out of view to the left or right)) [[Picture 4]](http://imgur.com/0Fxma)
* The rest of my clothes are stored in the desk area below and to the left of my computer area. Look at picture one and it's the area that's being a bit obscured by the chair. But it is not the large alcove directly to the left of my monitors. I figured this would be a hard one to explain, so I gave a picture. [[Picture 5]](http://imgur.com/1rLyI)
___________________________________________________________

Now, on to what I have to work with, in terms of free space. 

* This is above the sewing kit (the alcove area) shown in picture 3. [[Picture 6]](http://imgur.com/BaTwR)
* This area is directly left of my computer setup. It is slightly full, but it's holding insignificant old binders that can easily be bunched up, put in storage, removed, or whatever. [[Picture 7]](http://imgur.com/veeoh)
* Also, look back at Picture 2. Look directly above my computer chassis. There is almost nothing in that area, excluding a skull that I can move around or throw out.
___________________________________________________________

So, what do I want to do with the room? It seems decent enough already?

* I would enjoy becoming more minimalist. I have lots of storage, but still some clutter left out.
* Most importantly, I'd like a way to arrange my clothes. The current system isn't very useful. 
* I'd love just something creative. Since I have a large amount of schoolwork, I'm in my room often. I want it to be great.
* Some calming things would be cool. I already burn candles (incense is preposterously expensive). What about some [bamboo plants?]
(http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_WgF9RN2LSb0/TSpT8CM_XJI/AAAAAAAAA_4/nbBzoFDz8z0/s400/bamboo1.jpg)
* If calming won't work out, I'd be fine with going more technologically oriented. I'm thinking about setting up a Raspberry Pi mounted to the wall behind my computer (for FTP server) and stuff such as that. But if it has a lot of wires, they should be well maintained. Think of the room as having sharp edges. Contemporary. 
* Money is not an issue.

So, any thoughts or advice would be fantastic. Thanks for reading all of this!

Long time lurker, first time poster. I enjoy nice interior design but totally suck at actually designing something myself. That's where you, talented people of reddit, come in ;-)

**The Contest: Decorate my flat and win a 200$ IKEA coupon (or equivalent in your country)!**

All entries are appreciated and have an equal chance of winning: from simple hand-drawn sketches to 3D renderings.

[I've uploaded photos, a layout and even a 3D Google-sketchup.](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B8mr2Y3MS0dgckhMYktWNzVRQ1U&amp;usp=sharing)

Submission deadline: **over**

Please pm me your entries.

Once the deadline is over I'll publish all the entries and choose a winner, award her/him a 200$ IKEA coupon (or a coupon of equivalent value outside the US, or a comparable award of equal monetary value if the winner doesn't have access to IKEA)

(Disclaimer: I withhold the right not to anounce a winner if I don't like any of the designs. In that case I'll award a 25$ IKEA coupon (or equivalent) to the entry with the highest upvotes)

**Constraints**

* Must use a 200cm x 140cm bed.
* Must not cost more than 3,000$

**Preferences**

What I need:

* Bed
* Wardrobe (or alternative clothes storage)
* Desk
* Chair
* Book shelf

(These are the essential things that I need - the rest is up to you ;-) )

What I like:

* Minimalistic and clean designs that only contain what you actually need. With a lot of empty space that allows the room to 'breathe' ([example1](http://imgur.com/svuSC), [example2](http://i.imgur.com/NPeNpPp.jpg), [example3](http://imgur.com/a/HJFnw))
* Wooden materials: I think they are natural and timeless
* I love technology, gaming and techno music
* Traditional and masculine values - would fancy to have a flat that shouts: bachelor pad/man cave

THANK YOU

Thanks for all the great submissions! You all did a fantastic job! You respected my preferences while adding your own accent to the designs, each of which has its own exciting theme. Personally though, zippidee's design appealed the most to me: I liked the overall simplicity, the modest furniture and especially the very gentle mix of orange and blue-gray.

I will start a work-in-progress thread soon and keep you guys updated as I finish one room after the other and implement the winner's design ;-)",,False,,t5_2ux9b,1375824661.0,,,True,t3_1iiqge,http://www.reddit.com/r/DesignMyRoom/comments/1iiqge/reddit_interior_design_contest_win_a_200_ikea/,

They didn't. I'm just as clueless as before.  

So if anyone out there enjoys this sort of thing and feels like taking a crack at telling me what to do, what to buy, and how to arrange it, I would be most grateful.

Feel free to ask any questions.

The door you see is the entrance. There are two more similar windows to the right of the fireplace. Also, it's a rectangular room.

I haven't bought any furniture yet because I'm unsure of what colors to get. I was thinking of a brownish couch to go with the carpet, but what other colors could work? I plan on painting the walls a different color. Whatever goes with the couches and carpet.

I want to mount my TV over the fireplace where that clock thing is. I was thinking of floating the couch away from the left wall, closer to the fireplace, to create some kind of a flow when walking inside.

So I'm a teenager about to leave for college, and my mom and I would like to turn my room into a more guest-friendly, ""adult"" room. I just gave away a lot of stuff, so it looks a bit bare at the moment.

(Ignore the random boxes/suitcases on my floor and frames on my desk- all part of the moving out process, haha)

Would love suggestions on to how to make it look a little more modern/impressive, while still leaving enough of my ""touches"" around so that it still feels like my room, as it will be during breaks and such.

Some ideas I've had thus far: 

* adding a few solid color throw pillows to my bed
* re-doing my bulletin boards and painting the corkboard behind them black
* adding some art such as [this](http://thenewdomestic.com/2010/03/weekend-art-project/) to the room- not sure where though! (suggestions appreciated)

Not looking to spend too much money- hopefully just rearranging the things I already have, for the most part. I've already done some of that to my bookcases, and I think they do look a lot more adult-ish, whatever that is.

Still need some ideas though, specifically what to put on the walls and a couple pieces of furniture.

My budget is about $300 for decorative stuff, $200 for a dresser, $75 for a bookshelf and $50 for a coffee table if I end up getting one. I can be a bit flexible, but less expensive is better.

I cannot paint the apartment (I've asked), but they're fine with me nailing/screwing things into the walls, so long as they can fix it with some spackle when I move out. I'm a fan of modern decor, but I realize that it may not be possible to give my place a 'style' with the lack of painting options and the somewhat mismatched furniture I currently have. Really I'd just like to have my place feel like home and not some college place with girly posters and beer signs on the wall.

**Living Room**:

As you walk into the apartment, [the kitchen is to your left](http://i.imgur.com/Cs577R1.jpg) and is separated from the living room by a counter. The living room is 12' x 12 1/2' and [looks like this](http://i.imgur.com/9VgCJPU.jpg). Now that I've moved my stuff in though, [here is what the current setup is](http://imgur.com/a/2wp7Y). I'm probably going to be using the opposite side of the counter as a breakfast bar just so I don't have to worry about a table or anything. I'm thinking about putting a coffee table in between the couch and my desk, but i'm not sure there is enough space. There's 6 feet of space between the two when my chair isn't at my desk, and 3-4 feet when my chair is there.

[This is my desk right now](http://i.imgur.com/D4p4zvh.jpg) and I'm thinking about mounting my TV on the wall, just above the height of the monitor. Mounting it centered above the desk puts it even with the right side of the couch, and mounting it centered across from the couch puts it about where it is right now.

Next to the desk, I'd like to put a bookshelf, but right now it's where I'm putting the [boxes filled with books](http://i.imgur.com/vDN9yLG.jpg). I could use the shelving on the opposite side of the kitchen counter, but they aren't very deep and it'd be a bit awkward with the chairs there. Right now I'm looking at [this bookshelf](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/10196431/#/10103088) from Ikea for $70, but I'm open to suggestions.

**Bedroom**:

My bedroom is pretty basic right now, with only my bed in it so I'll just [post the pictures without much description](http://imgur.com/a/L56tc). I need a dresser though and am thinking about either putting it directly opposite my bed, directly ahead of you as you walk in the door and where the mini-bookshelf/TV stand is in the fifth picture, or putting it in the closet. I'm open to alternate clothing storage suggestions though.

I'm looking at a couple dressers from Ikea, either [this one](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/60239268/) for $250 or [this one](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/90252748/) for $130.

**Miscellaneous**:

Right now I've got this [mini-bookshelf/tv stand](http://i.imgur.com/slgiqPO.jpg) that I don't know what to do with. The only place for it at the moment is at the foot of my bed where I'm planning on putting my dresser once I get it. I could use it as a bookshelf, but it's too small for all of my books. I have a small flatscreen to put on it, but I don't really have anything to hook up to the TV to make it useful. I'm thinking about just putting it on Craigslist, but if someone here has an idea of how I could use it, that'd be great.

At the moment, I only have two things to put on the walls. A [picture of my dad and I](http://i.imgur.com/mr5h3Gf.jpg) at a baseball game with some framed memorabilia from the game, and [a signed poster that I got from astronaut John Glenn](http://i.imgur.com/QXNwYmL.jpg) when I was 8. Neither are really consistant with any style, but I'd like to put both of them up because they both have some pretty good memories associated with them.

Thanks so much for your help and suggestions in advance!

I really like the dark blue and white theme I have. It's a very nice dark color and it makes my room very relaxing. But if there are any other colors that are relaxing i would take them into consideration!

I guess I am looking for layout ideas. My room is pretty small the way it is. The queen bed takes up over a 1/3 of my room and the drawers take up the rest.

Maybe new furniture. With that said I am a broke college student, so I'm hoping for some ideas on making the most of what I have.

 My walls are pretty empty outside of the tack board and light I have over my bed. I've been considering taking those down but I don't know what to hang up

I recently moved across the country, and went from a 730 sq ft apartment to one I estimate to be about 300 total sq ft, with the living area alone being about 220 sq ft (about 12x18). My existing stuff (some of which I'll have to jettison immediately upon arrival since I don't think it's going to all fit in here) is going to be 3 weeks late, so I've been living out of my suit case and sleeping bag lol (please excuse the mess in the pictures). I figure now might as well be a good time to get some ideas.

Here's a panorama of it: http://min.us/l8Ji57vYVQhPv
The entrance and kitchen can be seen on the far right. 
Kitchen: http://min.us/lQNEtusZKXBi5
The fridge is stainless steel for those wondering. 

As you enter the apartment, there's exposed brick on your left with an unusable fireplace. 

The rest of the walls are freshly painted white (of course). I'm not really willing to paint the walls for an apartment, but I am open to stenciling.  However, I already have a big colorful painting that I'll probably put on the back wall.

Couple more views: http://min.us/lkjRKeDW0CRtB
http://onethread.minus.com/lbxuy6zv3LOQfj

While I enjoy and appreciate many styles, I took the stylefinder in the sidebar just for kicks and it says I'm transitional. Which is probably accurate. I like contemporary, but cozy. I was thinking of going towards blue or green tones, but I'm not sure how that would react with the red brick. Also, I'm not sure if I should factor in the kitchen design (which is fixed). 

Restrictions and mobilities: I have an off white couch that I'm not willing to get rid of (While it's not the style I envisioned myself getting, I got a good deal for it!) See here: http://min.us/lbqafKvlNiI0yO You can also see the painting there. Also, for the record, that is not me, and I am a dude.

I haven't decided if I'll get a tv, but if I do, it will probably be centrally mounted above the fireplace. In that case, the couch would face it, which would likely force my bed to be by the window. 

I'm probably going to jettison my birch Ikea desk because it's too large. I'll probably jettison my birch malm bed shortly after because I think I should get a frame that has storage space below it since I'm definitely in need of it. That leaves me with an ikea birch expedit bookshelf in terms of furniture.

My landlord requires that I get a rug.

I'm about to move into my first real appartment and realy could use some help from you awesome people!

Im a 24year old single Dutch Dude who's looking at you great people to help me design my first home!

Let's get started!

The floorplan: [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/vx8YA)

Some pictures: [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/ZaKMN), [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/rM37e), [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/sfLEQ), [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/nSWlD), [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/V5iyf)

As you see it isnt much but it's (almost) home.

I realy like the big windows and the long layout of the room.

The bedroom is about the size of Anne Franks room, not much. So only room for a bed.

The Bathroom is simple, and since I rent the appartment, I cant change anything.

SO my question is, what do I do with the rest?!

These are 3 quick layouts that I just made.

1; [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/qI0zb)

2;[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/up7K3)

3;[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/06jwH)



As you can see on the pictures, next to the windows are 2 rather big radiators. 
I dont realy know how I should put the sofa and what kind of sofa I should buy. I realy like the L-shaped sofa's due to my lenght and I would love to look out of the window from my sofa, but the radiators taking up quite some space.

Since the bedroom is so small, there isnt any space for a clothing wardrobe. This has to be placed in the main room.
I put it on the left side of the wall.

Looks and colour wise:
I'm realy a fan of the industrial/bachelorpad style. Old warehouses with brick walls, wooden bars in the ceiling, stuff like this:
[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/O179v), [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/ywAri), [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/4dzbJ), [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/E6OSs), [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/rZzEm), [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/6HZwv)

But since Im living in the real world and not in a massive Manhatan appartment with brick walls and massive rooms I need some good idea's to get that fibe going.

Colour wise I like Grey, not the 50shadesof, but just the colour.
I find it very difficult how to paint the room since its a long, narrow room with quite long walls. Im affraid if I paint it all in the same colour it becomes to dark.

Colour idea's: [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/uW8Pf), [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/jdc4E), [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/LeiWO)

As you can see the floor and the kitchen aren't realy matching the whole grey fibe, so how can I use that wooden fibe mixing nicely with mr.Grey?

I also was thinking about applying a wallsticker somewhere to break the grey but other idea's are realy welcome!

Wallsticker1:[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/ihBUI)

Wallsticker2:[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/ig5mQ)

Like I said, I have no idea how to place everything so feel free to come up with a whole different lay out that while blow my freakn mind!!


Thanks for spending some time reading this and thanks in advance for any idea you wish to share with me!


Cheers!

**I am looking for advice in rearranging the furniture for the most part, and cheap ways of improving a room. I'm not looking to spend more than around $200-250 in the near future.**

You'll see the difference in styles when you look at the common room verses my bedroom. I think we did a good job of combining our tastes, but it's still not coming together perfectly.
     
Unfortunately the walls are kind of a drab color, and it's a rental so I can't paint them. I would love to have some amazing oversized wall art, especially for the living room, but it's just too expensive.
     

The living room feels a little fragmented. We each contributed different pieces, and because of that I feel like they don't really come together well. I'm not sure how to make the coffee table, entertainment stand, and bookcase go together with the room. No idea what to do with the red ottoman. I bought the trunk as a coffee table but the size is awkward, so I just put it by the door and threw some pillows on it. The living room is also very drab to me, it needs more light and color. The couch especially needs some color, and I would love to add colorful throw pillows, but the back of the couch is pillows rather than cushions so that makes it difficult.
  
The dining room comes together alright but it's a little empty and unfinished looking. Curtains would do wonders I think, if I could find ones I like for the room. I wish I could paint it!
  
My bedroom is unfinished. Haven't had enough money to get good bedroom furniture, so I've been using random garage sale furniture. I want to cover the wall opposite my bed in a poster/print collage. I already have the prints and just need to frame them. But the room still looks kind of cheap/unfinished.

My sister is moving out of the house to live with her husband, so my mother wants to do something with her room. Her general idea is to make it into her study. I think she wants more of a lounge or reading room rather than a working study. However my mother is in the beginnings of a new landscaping business so maybe a computer desk is in order or maybe even a drafting table? Stylewise my mother likes traditional styles but not over the top, so traditional contemporary (does that make sense?).

	Stylefinder said: Your style is Romantic
Elegant yet relaxing. Luxurious fabrics, soft colors, fresh florals. Appeals to all the senses and sets a warm mood. My home has Romantic style.




The Room will be completely empty, bare walls, floor molding will likely be replaced. Wood floor will remain. We have no existing furniture to put into this room.

We were thinking a window seat would make the room. I drew something up on sketchup, It may not look like it but its very preliminary. We think it looks too heavy, I rotated the shelves inward to lighten it up, but i feel the top is still too heavy. The 28”x12” tumor in the corner of the room is a real problem, its an exterior wall so it can’t be fixed. Drew up a small fold out desk thingy and some shallow shelves, again very preliminary. Open to better ideas.

The Hallway door leads out into the rest of the house, so this is the primary door. The bathroom door leads into a shared bathroom with another bedroom.

Closet will be empty and we don’t really need the storage its a little over 2’ deep and probably 6’ something wide. Maybe remove the door and do something else with that space? I was thinking about doing the built-in seat thing over there, but maybe its nicer by the window.

Shelving wise, we built some nice shelves in another room so we don’t have a lot of nice things to be displayed on shelves.

Bottom line is this room has been a bedroom for so long, were unsure how to arrange or what furniture to get for it. We need some fresh eyes and perspectives. Or more likely the room isn’t worth a damn.

I was looking around at what other people did with a similar space, and [this](http://i.imgur.com/BIFQg8K.jpg) place caught my eye, particularly the island by the kitchen, the light fixtures, and the sliding door bedroom. The couches will be facing a 46'' TV on top of a regular Ikea TV stand. However, I can't figure out how I would fit a desk in here and where it would face. I need a lot of desk space for work, and am planning to move my L shaped table in. I also have a ton of empty wall space that I don't know what to do with. 

If anyone has ideas for a desk, alternative layouts, or advice for decorating the place, it would be greatly appreciated!

I've just signed on for another year with this tiny bedroom and I'd really like to maximize the space, both in terms of feel and efficiency.  

I was thinking of getting some curtains and maybe painting an accent wall but I really don't know much about interior design.  Also, its definitely time for a comforter.

Maybe a coat-rack to keep my jackets off my bed/chairs/desk, keep running gear off the floor, and a backpack off my spindly white desk chair?

Also, it'd be nice to make better use of that closet... it's 3'x4'.

Thanks for your thoughts!  I appreciate any input as I'm clearly clueless.

PS I'm not worried about money... I'll probably be in this room for a few years.

There is a space about 1'7"" wide to either side of the window. An 11' curtain rod is hard enough, but the biggest problem is that there is 1 inch between the window and the ceiling.

1347633445.0,10,self.DesignMyRoom,zvm36,"Tabula rasa - help a Redditor design a small, simple, tranquil bedroom from the ground up (xpost from r/InteriorDesign)",12,2,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/DesignMyRoom/comments/zvm36/tabula_rasa_help_a_redditor_design_a_small_simple/,"Broadly followed the [guidelines to asking for help in the sidebar.](http://www.reddit.com/r/InteriorDesign/comments/uqqd7/guidelines_for_asking_for_help/)

1) LAYOUT  The room is a bedroom in a 3-bedroom shared Chicago apartment and is relatively small: 10 1/2 feet by 8 1/2 feet.  Sketchy layout [here](http://i.imgur.com/gZf6t.jpg).  [View from the door](http://i.imgur.com/NMSwE.jpg) and [view from the corner](http://i.imgur.com/VBgTJ.jpg) of the room looking back toward the door.

**Three features to work around,** otherwise a relatively blank slate:
- A light fixture on the ceiling, which can be seen in the top of [this photo](http://i.imgur.com/NMSwE.jpg)
- A street light close to the window on the longer wall, which might make me want to put up some sturdier drapes or blinds.
- A bed will go in there, obviously.  I understand the space is a bit constricted for a bed.  I'd prefer a queen or full size bed.  **I could use some help with advice on whether a queen would fit.**

2) USE OF SPACE I'll be using the space mostly to sleep and to retreat from the world a bit.  A desk would be a strongly desirable but not necessary feature -- perhaps a smaller stand-up desk or a multi-use piece that I could set my laptop on and sit at.

3) FEELING/STYLE I want the room to be **simple, clean, and tranquil.**  I prefer designs described as ""crisp"" or ""serene"" to ornate.  I'm open to painting (though I need to check with roommates/landlord).  Even after reading the guides in the sidebar, I don't know exactly how to describe the colors I think of, just that I would stay away from more neon and very bright colors.

**""Minimalist""** is a tricky word but I think it's in the general direction of what I like.

I don't know if ""continuity"" of rooms is important, but I've taken some pictures of the common area so you can see the style of the apartment [here](http://i.imgur.com/FSEgw.jpg) and [here](http://i.imgur.com/Zz7nr.jpg).

To translate this to my personal style, I'm more likely to wear jeans that fit well with a v-neck of a nice color than a very colorful patterned and striped outfit.

I am early 20s, male, single, straight, like hiking, reading, the Green Bay Packers, and more.  I work in consulting.  Two pictures of me active in two different realms: [pic 1](http://i.imgur.com/dev9A.jpg) and [pic 2](http://i.imgur.com/mvog9.jpg)

4) BUDGET My budget is flexible.  I think $2000 is a good start, and I'm willing/have time over the next two weeks to DIY, though I don't have much experience.

5) LIST OF ITEMS/FEATURES -- a bed is necessary, some sort of desk and dresser/shelves are pretty essential.

-It's a 1 bedroom apartment that's 715 sq ft.

I have included the floor plan, 3 different pictures (different angles) of the living area, and the basic items that I am interested in buying. All accessories and decorative items will be purchased after I've lived in it for a few weeks. 

-I'm sort of stumped when it comes to the dining area, choosing curtains, and light fixtures. Preferably, I would like to replace the vertical blinds with curtains, replace the fixture in the dining area, and paint a few walls if I am allowed to by the management. If painting is not allowed I would like to cover an accent wall or 2 in removable (temporary) wallpaper or fabric (adhered with liquid starch).

I'm currently in a 11'9""x13' but am moving to a 11'x12' but it has a larger closet. Here is the layout of the new place (2D and photos of my current place). All furniture is as pictured in the room. The last photo is a stock photo of an organizer I have.   

Album of current apartment and future layout plan: http://imgur.com/a/ftaIZ#0  



###Use of Space:
I'll be using the space as a bachelor. I want it to be a fine line between a bachelor's room and a hotel room. I like how hotels utilize space efficiently. The only thing else I will be doing is using my desktop.   


###How I feel about the space:
I like it the furniture a lot but I feel like it's missing something. I'd say that I like masculine rooms. I wouldn't mind a new desk or painting the one I have. Here is an album of a few rooms I found that I liked. I like the idea of not having the normal ""softer tan"" paint even if I only paint one of the four walls. The new room will definitely need better wall art. I will probably get a piece like this, if not this exact one:

Pictures: http://imgur.com/a/P38IH
The doors are going to be poplar with the same custom stain; all trim and moldings will be white.

Colors I am considering:

SW 6086 Sand Dune - For the kitchen, living room, and hallway areas. I am going for a warm neutral. The kitchen currently has white cabinets.
http://www.sherwin-williams.com/homeowners/color/find-and-explore-colors/paint-colors-by-family/SW6086-sand-dune/

SW 6088 Nuthatch - For the office. There is a skylight, and there will be an oak desk in the room.
http://www.sherwin-williams.com/homeowners/color/find-and-explore-colors/paint-colors-by-family/SW6088-nuthatch/

SW 6089 Grounded - For the master bedroom. I'm going for a chocolate brown that isn't too dark. Furniture in this room is all dark brown/espresso-colored wood.
http://www.sherwin-williams.com/homeowners/color/find-and-explore-colors/paint-colors-by-family/SW6089-grounded/

SW 7015 Repose Gray (not sure about this one at all)- Going for a light gray for the master bathroom (I don't want the gray to look blue). Floor tile is white, drawers under sink are white. Art and towels in the room will be red. I have yet to find a gray I really like.
http://www.sherwin-williams.com/homeowners/color/find-and-explore-colors/paint-colors-by-family/SW7015-repose-gray/

SW 6444 Lounge Green or SW 6445 Garden Grove - For the guest bathroom. Going for a green that looks good with this: http://fineartamerica.com/featured/bamboo-forest-trail-hana-maui-dustin-k-ryan.html
http://www.sherwin-williams.com/homeowners/color/find-and-explore-colors/paint-colors-by-family/SW6444-lounge-green/ or http://www.sherwin-williams.com/homeowners/color/find-and-explore-colors/paint-colors-by-family/SW6445-garden-grove/

SW 6758 Aquaduct (really not sure about this one either) - A light blue for my meditation/yoga/workout room (but one that does NOT look like a baby room, lol). I'm going for a blue that looks good with both greens and blues - I plan to have several landscape-type photographs/paintings on the walls. This is one of them: http://i.imgur.com/IAiQkLU.jpg

We're wanting to do just a refinish for now and eventually do a counter,  back splash, and sink replacement.

there is a fireplace that juts out from the wall, and limits interior decorating potential.   we're working on a limited budget, and removing the fireplace is not an option at this time.  we moved in here less than a year ago, when i was having a difficult pregnancy, and then the baby came, and with all of the transition, we're finally at a point where we really need to get going on making our house a home!


we are going to paint (husband gathering some quotes this week.)  we're going to use some of our savings for new carpet/laminate/tile throughout the house, probably in the next month.


how would you place the furniture?  any ideas on utilizing the odd amount of space in the middle of the room?  would you keep the blinds, or remove them?

For the windows, I have no clue what to do, especially with the long high ones over the desk and computer.

My biggest challenge is the massive fireplace/mantle. The pictures I have hanging now are fine, but not perfect. And the void of the empty fireplace needs to be filled with something. I played around with the idea of plants or a statue but cant settle on one thing.

1. It's an old house, and unusually shaped.  It was hand built by the original owner in the 40's, and it doesn't fall into any of the usual categories of Craftsman or Bungalow.

2.  This space is still in flux...it needs to be completely redone from ceiling to floor, including windows, which is why I decided to begin furnishing it before remodeling (cheaper).  Everything, decor, rug, furniture, is in flux, so *anything* can change and probably will!

It feels homey, but not completely. I can only use small nails and thumbtacks as I'm leasing the apartment, and I can only paint a color that can be painted over white when I move out, as the landlord will charge extra if they need a second coat.  

Ideas I've had:

* A tan or biege strip from the ceiling to a few inches underneath the top of the closet, all the way around the room.
* A new lamp for the nightstand
* More art (working on getting some pictures printed and framed)
* Moving the Never Forget poster to above my head on the bed, so next to the window
* Mounting the mirror on the wall, as opposed to resting on the small set of drawers with my boxers and socks
* A neutral colored skirt to hide the frame and white box spring

Room is 13'x14'

A couple things I know already: 

* clean up bookshelf, 
* need to work more on hiding wires, 
* DESPERATELY need a loveseat for next to the radiator. 
* need a frame for the painting 
* new lamp. I really need black or wood speakers (I might DIY some speakers a la /r/diyaudio , I am pretty decent at woodworking)
* rug is too small, but damn bigger rugs than that are expensive
* disregard industrial fan

I have a third floor view of a lovely brick clocktower next door, a hill with trees, and a 7-11 / traffic light combo!

I did try to tie all the colors together, so the pillows match the painting/lamp/candle/plant pot [that isn't there]/green chairs, the rug is the same shade as the cloth in the wicker lamps, and so forth. the furniture is espresso, not quite solid black. Oh and by no fault of my own the grey curtains match the radiator.

There could probably stand to be some serious improvement though. Apologies for my horrendous photography.

I'm using the 203k FHA loan and having some renovations done. I'm working closely with a contractor who will be doing all of the work, but we have only discussed general ideas so far. Once we close on the house, we'll really start the intensive planning. I've come to you guys for your advice and suggestions in the meantime so that I am very prepared when we start.

The house has large, neutral-colored ceramic tiles throughout the first floor (living/dining room and kitchen) and the second floor hallway. The bedrooms are all carpeted. I think eventually I will want to replace the tiles with hardwood, but for now I'm working with the tile. **Opinions on ceramic tile throughout the house? Pros/cons? Would you replace with hardwood?**

Part of the renovations will be a completely new kitchen, and they will have to take the tiles out of half or all of the kitchen and put new flooring in. I'm considering hardwood flooring instead of trying to find a tile that complements the tiles already there. **New ceramic tiles in the kitchen or hardwood?**

I'm also having a new full bath put in, location not yet confirmed. I'd like it to go in the living room (as I drew it in the room planner below) but it will block off the only window on that whole side of the room. Other options we've discussed are putting it completely in the kitchen, and splitting it between the two rooms (taking the wall down) and leaving a small nook for the living room window to stay in that room. **Looking at the drawings and photos below, where do you think the bathroom should go?**

Once structural stuff is determined, I'll need to actually furnish and decorate the place. I put furniture in the room planner just to see how things will fit. The furniture in there is all just generic, so what I end up finding will vary. I'd love to hear your ideas for decorating the place, though.

So... There it is! I know theres a lot of clutter and junk, but you get the idea.


**Here's the basic idea of what I would ideally have:**

-A room where I can sleep comfortably, as well as work and study.

-Ive always wanted a matching color scheme, just a good looking room.

-Something awesome, I don't know, I just realized my room sucks because I don't really have any ideas of how to make it better so it's hard to say what I want &lt;_&lt;.....

**Here's some problems I always have:**

-I always feel claustrophobic in there! Don't know if it's the color scheme or the layout or the junk, but it's hard to relax.

The biggest problem is the stairs, they create so many walls. Big walls, little walls, we can't figure out any of it. Should we run the family room color around that wall behind the closet (past the clock on the wall and over the ledge) to the big wall that runs down to the basement, or start a new, more neutral color that will transition to the basement. And then how to handle the smaller, angled sections that make up the walls under the stairs is odd too. Would the section that comes down from the ceiling normally be painted white like a ceiling or colored like the wall?

This wall is opposite the three large windows in the bay window. Could this be painted a shade or two darker than the rest of the room as it gets a ton of light from those windows. (cat shadow on the wall, because Reddit)

Looking for help in the layout of [this tiny apartment](http://imgur.com/RAejC). (The grey space in the middle is where I cut out the apartment number, that's all) I have not moved in yet, and the landlord hasn't provided me with measurements, but I'm just looking for a basic idea of where to place things in the main living area. 

As you can see, it's basically one room (besides the bedroom and bathroom) with the kitchen against one wall, and windows along a corner, which gives the place lots of natural light, even though it's small.

The king size bed is going either against the wall to the left, or against the wall that is all windows. I haven't decided yet, and I think I'll just have to see. I was thinking if it went along the window-wall, I could put a large bookshelf (if there's room) along the far-left wall of the bedroom. There's also minimal closet space, so I'm going to need a dresser for sure. (In previous apartments, I just used closet-hanging cubes, but I don't think that will work here)

I have one piece of furniture that I really like, a mid-century record console - [this is really close](http://vintageground.blogspot.com/2011/08/mid-century-modern-record-console.html) - that I bought as a birthday present years ago for myself, and would like to highlight, as I actually use it to listen to records, and often plug my computer into it as I like the sound quality.

Other wise, I need to get:

* a couch (was thinking a futon - is this a big no-no? I need somewhere for guests to stay, and sleeper sofas are from the devil and impossible to move);

* bookshelves (I have lots of books - was thinking of using bookshelves as bedside-tables to double up);

* and possibly a dining area something-or-other to eat at (although space is so tight, I'm not sure how to do that)

* I also need to store my bike somewhere, and was thinking of hanging it somewhere on a wall - [like this](http://manmadediy.com/users/chris/posts/1955-how-to-make-a-diy-wall-mounted-bike-hanger-from-drop-handlebars).

I have lots of nice stuff I like to hang on the walls, so it will mostly be an issue of where I can fit everything in that sense; I mostly need help on where to place stuff! I'd like to take advantage of the lots of light that comes in, and was thinking of putting the couch under the windows, but then would I put the ""dining area"" against the wall with no windows? I like walking into a welcoming space, so I feel like whatever is against the wall on the other side of the bathroom (the entrance door is right next to the kitchen, although there is a closet and tiny hallway there).

A little background first. I am 24 yr old male civil engineer that will be getting a puppy in two months. I enjoy having people over and entertaining. I have traveled a lot and have lots of pictures. I tend to lean towards more natural colors and I really have no idea what sort of ""style"" I have maybe... chic farm house or something like that.

The pictures show it in its current state. The space will be empty and the kitchen cabinets are going to be refinished white. I have no furniture so everything is going to be bought or made so links to items would be awesome. I can't change paint colors or floors or anything.

**Some of my thoughts:**

 * Projector for tv?
 * Trying to put a small table next to the counter for more eating space maybe match the height and use stools for the table?
 * I like plants and have been known to keep them alive the only plant I have right now is a 4yr Hoya
 * Have a wall feature? maybe something with fabric?
 * Area Rug?

**Needs**

 * TV and seating for 6
 * Coat rack / shoe rack by entry
 * Dog-ish safe

&gt;i am a student (21), and live with my family (love them).
&gt;My room is a constant mess for years now, and i always planned to clean it properly, and rearrange it nicely. When i found this subreddit, i knew i could find the motivation for it, started browsing and got some good ideas, so i started planning as well.

[Here](http://imgur.com/a/bamf8)'s an album of my bedroom .(Floorplan included - i hope it's good enough, it should be scaled correctly)

I dont know how to rearrange the furniture. I'm really bored of the current setup, and also find it not too practical.    
Feel free to suggest me what to move where. (:    
What i think would be good to start with is to move the desk in front of the windows - ""Mehr licht!"" :). (i added two plans to the album too, but somehow i'm not satisfied with any ot those (also, the sofa isnt there on them).)

**Plans**:

* find a good place for the sofa
* ""break up"" the emptiness in the middle of the room
* fix some cheap and colorful curtains on the non-book shelves (patchwork maybe?)
* buy and start a small aquarium (place not yet decided for it)
* fix the holes on the wall
* paint some narrow-ish stripes on the wall ([source of idea](http://www.sasinteriors.net/2012/02/diy-how-to-paint-stripes-and-product-review-of-u-stripe-it/))
* make a small gallery wall
* find ideas for some more DIY extras which could make me feel the room more home and mine

***
*Some additional info*:

* the wall with the many wardrobes is the ""cold wall"", linking to the garden, so some wardrobes would be best kept in front of that wall as some thermal insulation.
* the holes in the walls were for ugly shelves disassembled long ago
* I don't use the TV, and like to use the piano-chair as a nighttable if i'm watching a movie on my laptop.
* My budget is very low, so mostly would like to stick to rearranging, and minimal additions.
* I live in Budapest (Hungary)
* I rather keep to myself in the room, when friends are over we usually use the living room
* My girlfriend's dad has a carpenters' store, my uncle is handy with electricity, and i like doing DIY

I'm grateful, and eager to hear any remarks and ideas! Have a nice day!

**EDIT**:    
Here's the floorplan i'm going with atm:
http://imgur.com/vWGAc

* i moved the glass-doored cabinet to my brothers' room, and moved in a big wardrobe (like the bigger one in the line). i put the 2 bigger ones to the corner, and the lower, TV-one next to it, 1 bookcase stays in the line.
* i thought i'd like a more central place for my aquarium (i ordered an [Aquael shrimp set](http://www.aquael.pl/images/stories/0Akwarium/Zestawy_akwariowe/shrimp.jpg), it will ship this week hopefully), so i moved the TV into one of the bigger wardrobes, and the aquarium will take its old place
* i made up my mind on getting rid of the cloth hanger, and will apply a rod into the narrower wardrobe, which is now on the left side from the door if you enter (and i'll use some kind of vertical cloth hanger / hooks if the place won't be enough)
* the piano will stay in the corner, in the angle (or maybe will move a bit closer to the wall, as with the new wardrobe-settings there are some extra space, but still in an angle, not paralell)
* i moved the poang chair to my parents' room, my dad's armchair is quite old, and he uses it often to watch tv / read, i'll might keep the old armchair in my room
* i'll paint the stripes on the bed's wall, and til the window (in an L shape, marked with an orange line in the pic) - i think i'll use light orangeish-yellow/light reddish-crimson/light peach-ish colors, with white interception lines.

After removing the wardrobes from the wall, i treated the mold in the upper and lower corners (the whole house still smells of chlorine). I also filled the holes with plaster.   
By removing all stuff and back, i sort my things through and out, and i'm getting more space = good. However, i'll need to organize my space better, so i think i'll need some paperboard boxes (low-budget) on the shelves.

The room is still a big mess, the [sofa-corner is almost done](http://i.imgur.com/HUL3g.jpg), the painting is the next on my checklist. (:

You can see from the pics what its like, although they don't really do it justice - i'd guess the ceilings are at about 10 or 11 feet.  I'm six feet tall and I can't reach within a foot of the top of the windows without jumping.  The room is MUCH larger than it appears in the pictures.

Some other relevant info:  

-I'm shooting for a more modern/asian look, slightly minimalist even perhaps.  I hate clutter, and giant fat overstuffed couches.  

-I don't have a huge budget, but i could spend a maximum of 3000 dollars over the next month or two, and it seems a lot of furniture stores will give cheap financing right now.  

-I'm willing to paint, but I'd prefer not to.  The current walls are a sort of light beige/cream color.  My preference would be to get some large artwork to take up space.  I was thinking a big Chinese painting might be cool - I can get one next time I go back over for work.

-I may get a large fish tank in a year or so when I'm sure I won't have to move again soon.  I'm not sure what type - maybe saltwater, but a [nature aquarium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquascaping) would be my preference if I think I'll have the time to take care of it.

My S.O. and I just signed on our first 1 bedroom apartment together and we really like the space as it fits most of our needs, but now we're struggling to figure out the most effective way to arrange our furniture.  

We bought a new couch and chair this weekend and they are very comfortable and cozy but they obviously take up a lot of valuable space in the living room.  We both have our hobbies and wanted our own space, but a two bedroom was just not in our budget for the area we are in right now.  We still want a space that we can work on stuff, however.  Originally, we planned to arrange the couch, chair and tv the way I've depicted in the picture, and set up some desks along the wall that is shared with the kitchen, but once we got the couch and chair in there it seemed way too cramped.   

The kitchen area has a decent sized space for a table and I was thinking we could set up an area over there.  We need to fit two desks, one that's 32.5 x 18 and one that's 27.5 x 19.5 and probably some space for short bookshelves or other storage.

Youtube video of the apartment: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TtGhj9UwO0&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player

My wife and I are moving to Ecuador in September. We secured a fourth story apartment in the center of town for our return. The apartment is a 2bed/2bath with insanely good natural light, there are windows everywhere. We have free reign to make any cosmetic changes we desire. The worst thing about the apartment, in my opinion, is the ugly brown ceramic tile.

We are extremely limited in what we can bring with us from the states... Basically everything has to fit in our luggage, we can't ship anything at this time. That said, it is possible to have basically anything, furniture wise, custom made there. Our friends have what looks like an entire house full of Restoration Hardware furniture that was all made there for a tiny fraction of the price.

My ideas:

* At first, I wanted to cover over the ugly tile with some type of floating floor, but now I am thinking that I would like to embrace the brown and try to tie the whole place together with a cool color scheme. Here are a couple of palettes that I like that include a similar brown http://www.whorange.net/whorange/2012/07/wes-anderson-films-color-palette.html

* I would like hang art ""salon style"" (my wife and I are big fans of the Wes Anderson aesthetic, if that wasn't already obvious)

* I would like the space to have a modern, minimalistic look. Is the brown tile gong to contrast that style?

* Also, we are considering getting a Pillowsac ( http://www.lovesac.com/sacs/pillowsac.html) for the living room, as they compress very small and transport easily. Thoughts?

What I am looking for: EVERYTHING... Any thought on any of this, no matter how small or large would be greatly appreciated!

The computer set up needs to be incorporated into the room. Preferably with a desk that can fit 3 monitors.

I want to be able to fit a 46""+ TV above the sink. There is an outlet and ethernet ports for the tv, xbox, ps3, etc.

I am hoping to be able to fit a lazyboy in here but it doesn't seem likely.

I would like a more minimalist and elegant design with a low to medium budget. Spent a fortune building the place already.

There is room to get creative on the loft. I have my ""network hub"" up there. I was wondering if a mattress topper would be the only thing I could get considering the height of the ceiling. Also I'm using a towel as a curtain.

Current Layout

optional layout - http://imgur.com/ej89bGi

edit: budget: up to $1000 - this will effect the next 10 months of everyday living.
Room- 117"" L x 87"" W x 103"" H - (9.75' L x 7.25' W x 8.5' H)
queen bed 80"" x 60"" 
computer equip
Everything else is replaceable

I have been living in this room for 2 months now.. really need a closet and a solution to my -noroomforadesk- problem.  Sometimes i do work from home in this room at 3 am, and its tough to stay up all night on a nice comfy bed.  I also game, but havent been gaming since i moved in because it is very uncomfortable to sit up for extended periods of time, and the mouse is usually being used at a weird angle.

Bed - got a queen bed with storage.  6 drawers that open.  currently have pushed my bed into a corner and will need to pull it back out to gain access to the 2 drawers on that side.  Which means that the closet and/or the computer solution need to be raised from the floor so i can move the bed around.

Closet- originally wanted a closet with doors, but i believe it may be too inconvenient to have to wrestle with doors in a tiny space and also make the space feel cramped.  I'm not happy with having my clothes in my face all the time, but i would love to hear some ideas  on how to hide them. Looking at at least two hanging clothes poles.  Also an idea was to have the two hanging clothes poles and then have a diagonal one or rounded corner one, that is up top for the long clothes that would be closest to the door.

computer/office space - originally thought having a desk + closet in one area is the only way, but since i bought the bed i do not think there would be space.. so my bed is my desk i think.. but, my monitor is now too far away from me to see small text.
    Desktop measurements: 24"" x 17"" 9.5""  and weights about 45lbs (hella heavy)  
    Moniter is a 23"" right now, but  i am thinking of upgrading to a flat screen and just mounting it on the wall (top wall between pipe and door)  my only problem is not being able to see small text.. since right now i am on my bed leaning against the opposite wall.

The room itself is 11' by 11' and is pretty much a perfect square, without any real features to accent. It's already a pretty small room and I have a queen bed so I don't want to pick colors that make the room feel smaller.

Since I'm pretty much redesigning the room anyway, I'm willing to buy art or bedding in any style that would go well with the colors I pick, so there really aren't any limitations, except for the carpet, which is gray. I don't think I'll have the funding to recarpet the room, so that's the only limiting factor.

Since the room is in a state of constant redesign I didn't include any pictures, but I'll put some up if you want a look at the dimensions and the furniture or something.

Long time lurker here but now I need your help.
I've been looking at /r/InteriorDesign and /r/DesignMyRoom for a long time. And the time has come for me to get some advice from you.

Next month I'll be moving to my own place. I've made a floorplan for you [here](http://furnituredealer.planningwiz.com/plankey_35bf98501edec1431e0c2fabe948da66705011101027). 

I never had a place of my own and haven’t got any furniture. I would like your thoughts on how to arrange the room and comment on what I've been thinking about doing.

What I will be bringing from my old place:

• Bed

• 37 inch TV

• PC (22 inch screen)


There is not a lot of space, and I want to make it feel spacy by not filling it with furniture.

I would like to have people over for dinner, but not sure I’ll be able to fit in a desk, small dining table, sofa, coffee table and bed.

Hanging the TV on the wall, I imagine will save some space.

Shopping list - what I have thought about so far:

[Desk](http://www.ikea.com/dk/da/catalog/products/20186648/#/20147355)

[Chair](http://www.casanovafurniture.dk/shop/eames-armstol-daw-849p.html) (wishlist): Haven’t got the money for it, maybe someone knows one that looks like it?

[Ceiling light](http://www.westelm.com/products/industrial-pendant-glass-w682/?pkey=call-lighting): I’ve fallen in love with this lamp, but not sure it is going to work hanging in the middle of the room.

[Wall](http://www.ikea.com/dk/da/catalog/products/30120572/)

I haven’t looked at a sofa, coffee table and dining table because I’m not sure how to arrange it all.

I can’t provide any pictures yet, sorry about that.

I'm nearing 30 and getting married in April. Fiance and I are looking to start transitioning our living space into something that feels a little more like home and less like a college kid on a budget. We are currently renting, and we have plenty of space. Actually, we have a little too much space (our 2nd bedroom is still full of boxes and it's been a year since we moved in - our dining room has no table and is just a home for our chameleon's enclosure, etc). Anyways, I'm looking to start with the living room.

[Here is our living room](http://imgur.com/a/ulwcR) - please excuse the blurriness, my phone doesn't take pictures well with low light.

The room is quite a bit longer than it is wide, I don't know if the pictures convey it very well. On one side of it, there is a brick wall and setting with a wood burning stove placed on it. It's collecting quite a bit of dust at the moment. The stove is a permanent fixture. The blue couch in the photo is being put out on the curb and the brown couch will probably be replaced within 6 months. We have more books/games/discs than we have storage for. The card table visible in the doorway is not usually out, we only bust it out when people come over.

We don't spend a lot of time in the living room unless we: A. Have company (not often) B. Bought a new console game or C. It's Football season. Our dogs basically own the room (they stay downstairs). There is also a dog hair problem, we clean it up regularly but rugs and such are probably a no go. I'd also like any ideas on keeping hair off the furniture.

So, I appeal to you folks. We'd like to entertain company more frequently and have a nice place to do it. Money isn't too big an issue, and things can be purchased over time. We're pretty huge nerds/geeks, so anything artwork/items like that would be neat, but stuff that would pass as decor without being completely overt is ideal. Sorta like someone coming over and saying, ""I don't know what that is or where it's from but it looks awesome"" kinda stuff. (hard to explain what I mean)

By all means, lay some ideas out on me. Please!

In the pictures, the bed is facing towards the door/wall. However, I was thinking that it might look better rotated and facing the closet instead. 

I think a full-size bed might be my best option to avoid overpowering the room. I was also thinking about forgoing the often excessively bulky bed frames for a regular box frame bed (?). I would like to have some kind of headboard though. I've heard about DIY headboards - any suggestions? 

I'm not overly worried about storage as there is a huge wall length closet as well as a closet in the hallway. I don't think a dresser would fit comfortably in the room so I was thinking about getting the storage specifically meant for inside the closet (as shown in the picture). Also, lots of shelves?

The closing date is not scheduled until June 3rd but as that is just around the corner, I'd like to have at least a basic plan in place for how the room is going to be laid out. 


The house will contain me and four other 23-24 year old guys. In our present living situation we all like to loaf around and watch TV, Netflix, Movies, Sports, etc (who doesn't right?). As this is the only feasible common area for such a room in this new house I would like to work out how to make it a media room. 


Picture 1 in the gallery shows the view of this living room area from what is planned to be the dining room. 


Picture 2 shows the view from the table that is currently in the middle of the room. This is the left wall that you cannot really see in picture 1. 

Important things to note. 

- While there is a fireplace, we do not plan on using it and would actually be fine building around it or putting something in front of it. We live in the hot southern part of the US (Atlanta, GA) and don't plan using the fireplace.

- In the far side of picture 1 you can see a doorway that is actually the front entrance of the house. As there is a side driveway with side entrance and garage with garage entrance I do not anticipate us using the front door very often. 

- TV placement has been very hard for me to figure out. It is a long and narrow room with opposing walls being a set of windows and a fireplace. I don't really want to mount the TV above the fireplace as it is hard on the eyes and neck to view at such an extreme angle, and mounting/placing on the windows side seems foolish.

- **TV. We currently have a 55 inch LCD flat panel TV as well as an Epson PowerLite Projector and would be willing to use either as the main TV. The projector may give us flexibility to use a screen either in front of the fireplace or in front of the windows but I would love to hear what sort of creative ideas you all come up with. 

I'm open to any ideas you guys throw out. Thanks a bunch!

I've always had the smaller room since we were kids, so when I was given the opportunity to move into her room and spice it up to my own standards, I took it!

Here are some pictures: [room album](http://imgur.com/a/ZR87B/)

I'm looking to paint the walls a yellow color. Anywhere from a [pastel yellow](http://i.imgur.com/lTFkory.jpg) to a [golden yellow](http://i.imgur.com/bB5M8no.jpg). Nothing too obnoxious, since this is my parents' house and they'll have to look at it for years after I move out. 

The carpet is going to be ripped out as well, after painting. I don't know what color is going to go best with the walls, but I know for sure I don't want white. I have two cats. And I've always had a love/hate relationship with anything white; clothes, walls, shoes, etc. 

This is basically the vanity dresser that I have: [Ashley Furniture Bittersweet Dresser and Mirror](http://www.ashleyfurniturehomestore.com/catalog/product.aspx?group=bedroom&amp;category=bedroomdressersmirrors&amp;id=B219B1&amp;spi=0&amp;ref=search-t).

I have the bedside table thing that goes with it. I also have a bookshelf in the same color.

I have cable in my room, and a 32 inch television. Cable can be moved, but it's been in that corner of the room [where the tv is in the pictures] since we moved in. 

Some things about me: I like yellow [I don't know if you could tell, but I **love** yellow]. I like giraffes, cats and bacon. Bright things excite me, and I plan on purchasing some strong lights like these, [not necessarily in blue](http://www.etsy.com/listing/115115758/20-blue-tone-cotton-ball-string-lights?ref=sr_gallery_12&amp;ga_search_query=string+lights&amp;ga_view_type=gallery&amp;ga_ship_to=US&amp;ga_search_type=all). But something to that effect. 

I guess this whole post is to just bounce some idea off the lovely people in this subreddit. If the yellow is a bad idea, if the layout is a bad idea, etc. Any and all comments are welcomed! I don't really have a budget, but I'm not trying to break the bank either. Somewhere around a $2500 - $3000 budget.

I made this post over in /r/interiordesign and would like to get as much input as I can.

I bought a house somewhat recently (scaling up from an apartment) and I have this room that I would really like to pop. However, I can't really think of where to begin. Here are the details:

The ""square"" portion of the room is 10' 9"" long by 10' 3"" wide. The tiny alcove leading to the door is 3' 5"" long by 3' 2"" wide.

I am honestly open to just about anything. I usually end up spending a lot of my time in here as it is where my computer is, although there is no reason it couldn't be used for multiple purposes. As for style, I like the idea of sleek and streamlined/modern mainly. My living room as a black tempered glass coffee table that I really like. So with that in mind, here are my current thoughts.

The desk needs to be replaced. It was an old particleboard type desk that I picked up at a thrift store since the apartment was my first time moving away from home. I was almost thinking some sort of glass corner desk? The curtain needs to go as well.

The current light fixture in the room matches the rest of the ones in the house, and while they look nice, I bet this room could get a lot more light. I always liked the idea of track lighting, I just wouldn't be sure how it would turn out in this room.

I thought about posters/art as well. My job consists of caring for reptiles and it is definitely a passion, but I can't decide if I want reptile pictures hanging all over my walls. If a room were to have them though, this would probably be it.

Budget is pretty open. a max around $1000-1500? Depends where the ideas go! I appreciate your time reading this and look forward to hearing some great ideas!

We came home and decided that we didn't really like the pieces as much as we did in the store, so we cancelled everything but the sofa, which we love. We were going in the right 'direction' though, but I think we want more of a rustic/modern minimalistic look...whatever that means. We love the wooden DIY tables seen in [/r/DIY](http://i.imgur.com/G9aqK.jpg?1), as well as [this dining style](http://www.hallofritz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/table02.jpg).  
In terms of layout, we want the 'entertainment area' in one of the window corners of the main room, facing the window..using the sectional to kind of divide between areas. We're planning on installing a floating desk along one of the walls..we're thinking in the 'dining area' on the floor plan, but it's not a solid plan and anything can happen at this point. Anyways I guess we're just looking for suggestions..seeing if anyone has any theme ideas, maybe some end/coffee tables that would match our description, or some help with the layout. Thanks!

I just moved in with my girlfriend into this old duplex house. She had a roommate living in the room that is now mine, but that roommate moved to the other side of the duplex.  I stay with my girlfriend in the room upstairs, but this new room is now completely open for me to do whatever I want with it. 
It's basically the living room of the house as it is the first room you enter upon entering the house.

[Here](http://imgur.com/a/wQQG4) are pictures of the space along with a rough diagram of the layout and dimensions. The old roommate still has a few items in the house that she has to remove and please forgive the mess, I still need to go through and clean up the place. I would like to use the space for entertaining people, but also as my personal get away area. I want to create a warm, classy, and largely open space where we can watch movies or do things around the floor. This is a high traffic area as people need to walk straight across the room from the entrance of the house to get to anywhere else in the house.

Here are my restrictions: 

* I don't have a lot of money. (surprise) I'd like not to spend more that $100-150 on decorating the room. We rent the place and will only be there until May. 

* I don't want to cover the air vents. (They're marked in orange boxes on my diagram) The room also only has 2 power outlets that can't be overloaded. (The house is very old and the frat boys around the corner just burned their house down from an overloaded outlet.)

* I have to use the dresser in the right of [this picture](http://i.imgur.com/zCUaf.png) to store my clothes somewhere in the room. The dresser is about 3 feet wide by two feet deep. (Don't have exact measurements available right this moment.) 

* The only seating I currently have is [this](http://i.imgur.com/uBk4t.jpg) futon. I also still have those two square rice paper floor lamps if they could be of use.

* I would like to somehow incorporate the fireplace. It is currently bricked up, but i was thinking it still might be nice to place a two-three level candle fireplace in front of it. I figured I could layer candles on the levels or something. i was inspired by [this](http://i.imgur.com/u4c0G.jpg)

* I need to set up a computer desk for my desktop and monitor somewhere in the room. I was thinking of getting an old wooden desk/table from a thrift store.

* I have a small projector that I would like to use to project movies on the large wall without windows. I was thinking of getting a large white sheet, like a drop cloth or something, doing the edges like a sail from an old wooden sailing ship, and having that pulled taught across the center of the large open wall via screw eyes and some sisal rope. It wouldn't bee too big as the projector's got shitty 720p max resolution. (Again, I don't have any money to afford anything else and I'd prefer to use the projector rather than a TV and have to get a tv stand.

What I've got in my head so far: I imagine putting the futon directly under the window across from the large windowless wall. (This way we could sit on the futon and watch movies on the opposite wall. I would put the large dresser to the left of the futon. (Left as in if you were sitting on it.) The dresser would fit flush with that little bit of wall that juts out two or so feet into the room. I was thinking of getting my computer desk/table and putting it directly under the other window, so I would be facing out the window. This way I could also link the computer to the projector with a cable.  The rest is wide open. I would like to put something (tapestries?) on the wall next to the sheet I'd use as a screen, but I'm really open to suggestions.

I submitted the above post about a month ago asking for some tips and ideas on how to better use my living room space.

Everyone gave me awesome ideas and asked for an update so I wanted to deliver, even though what we have accomplished so far hasn't been what I hoped for.

--The couches are both 77 inches wide.

That one fact alone, killed my hope for moving them around.  

I wanted to try for an L shape with the couches and while [one would fit on the wall with the DVD shelves](http://i.imgur.com/g6TNj.jpg), but [the second couch](http://i.imgur.com/5MPKc.jpg) would not fit on the back wall, due to the dip (or whatever it's called) on the far left.  

[The wall with the TV](http://i.imgur.com/IzqHu.jpg) nothing would fit on, besides the TV as it is only 55 inches.

So with regard to the couches, how we have it set up now, seems to be the only way they will fit.

What we have decided to do is:

* Get rid of the DVD/bookcase and my boyfriend is going to build shelving in that [dip in the back wall, on the left](http://i.imgur.com/K5SBe.jpg).  He is going to stain it to match the couches and table.  We began the process and cut the wood, but the wall bows out on the bottom, so he has to plane it and re-cut some of the shelves a tiny bit.

* On the wall where the DVD/bookcase is now, we are going to use as a picture wall.  So that will leave it more open.

* Paint the whole room another color.

Any suggestions on paint colors?   The only color I don't want is white.

*
*

We do have a [whole other room](http://i.imgur.com/AyLb7.png), which [we basically do nothing with](http://i.imgur.com/UZW1q.png), that I would LOVE to use as the living room, but BF is against it.

The landlord's bed room is above that room and he doesn't want to make too much noise with the TV and video games that would disturb him, (he goes to bed early because of work).   I totally understand that point, but our TV is never, ever that loud. 

He also hates the carpet due to the fact that when our dog was young, she would use that room as her potty since we were never in it.

As it stands i'm working on convincing him, but i'll probably loose out.

And here's a rough room plan:
http://i.imgur.com/0w5k2.png

* I plan on getting a new **desk** for my room. I'm not too sure on the shape that I want to get, nor of the style of the desk. I'm thinking of just having a rectangular desk, with a tempered glass top (like the one on the bedside table) and legs of a similar colour to my bed frame. However, by having a desk in front of the window, there is a area of space between the desk and the bedside table which is pretty much useless. I'm not too good at this kind of stuff, so any advice is greatly appreciated. 
* Secondly, I would also like a small **bookshelf** somewhere in my room for my textbooks and other miscellaneous stuff. Not too sure about colour once again. I don't mind rearranging the room. 
* Wall colour (the walls are currently a really light green), other decorations, etc.

I don't really have a budget, just not too over the top.

Any other suggestions are welcome. Thanks in advance guys!

I can do *whatever I want* within my budget - I plan to do it in stages to make it affordable. 

First priority is a sofa and a TV and shelf, since I have all the other absolute essentials. 

I was thinking about getting a kitchen island to use as a high dining table and suspending some lamps over it. I thought about some wood work surfaces on that, so to match the kitchen I would replace the existing crappy black work surfaces in the kitchen with the same wood.

I like natural colours with maybe some dusky teal thrown in (so maybe a dark brown sofa?), and maybe a muted purple for the bedroom? I don't want to go over the top with colour though, maybe have a wall of each and leave the rest white (but which wall?).

I might bin the wardrobes in the bedroom, they seem fairly cheap BUT they're brand new, so any ideas to make them better? I think I could also move them in the bedroom. 

So, erm, have at it! 

Ideas on furniture placement, colour, etc. are welcome!

The dimensions listed on the sale spec sheet for room size are: 4.45mx3.53m (~approx 13ftx11ft), although there is a short wall with a window on an exterior wall.

The colour seen in the photos has been done recently, so no plans to change it when moving in. Since the room is on the main floor, it's where we will spend a good bit of our time. Our older furniture from our last home will be used in other rooms, so this is a clean slate. We plan on purchasing a new TV, tables, stands, etc for the space.

There are TV/power hookups in place both on top of the fireplace and in the corner near the window as seen in the photos - I don't know if placing a TV on top of the fireplace vs wall mount vs placed on a stand would be the way to go.

I'd like the space to be a modern, clean and comfy space that is usable but looks nice. Budget for furniture around ~$5000 - not including TV, etc.

One of the reasons why I want to redo it is the floor. Dear god the floor.   I have a white/soft gray porours (PVC) floor, and a puppy, soon to be two. The floor shows dirt and mud instantly.  I want to replace the floor to something I don't have to clean so often or looks so hideous.  



One of the colors that I like is wyeth blue  ( My bedroom is wyeth blue and I like the way it meshes with the white)

Things I would like to do:
Paint, change the flooring, add a backsplash  (but for the right argument I would be okay without it) 


Feels I'm going for.   I spend a lot of time in the kitchen, I love cooking.  Cooking is my zen, so I would like a relaxing area.  Potentially going for a west elm/ martha's vineyard, contemporary style. 


Budget: I don't particularly have a budget, but it is a rental so I don't want to spend an insane amount on a rental. 


Any other ideas to improve the style (decorations etc) please let me know!

Right, so, I've bought my first house and am slowly trying to work out how to decorate each room. I'll probably but up a post per room as I get round looking at things, but I'll start here. 

As you can see below, it's quite a big space and I've mostly got furniture already that I really love (although the light wood computer desk and shelves will be replaced with (probably) black gloss ones once I have money again. I did have to ""Ripple Rocker"" chairs on order from Dwell for the ""Sun Room"" (extension with surrounding windows - the view of the hills for miles is spectacular!) but Dwell just went into Administration, so looks like I won't... At the moment I'm looking at just decorating, but am a little stuck with what to do.

I was considering, which my girlfriend likes the idea of... but I'm not so sure it'll work, was black gloss door, skirting board and radiators, the wallpaper in the album below on the wall behind the TV and the metallic silver (as in one of the photos) everywhere else (can't decide if it'll look amazing or awful, it could be very dark, but the reflectivity may mean not) then possibly paint the brickwork chimney gloss white.

The beams on the roof are fake and screwed into the ceiling, I was considering removing them but they've cut sections out of the edging round them, so I'd have to replace all that as well.

I like things very clean looking, don't really like artwork on the walls (though might mount my guitars on them possibly, I have a few more downstairs)

Oh, yes, [Photos](http://imgur.com/a/fMz8G#0)!

There's very little colour so far (I'm mainly a fan of dark blue) but quite like the silver/black/white theme. The wallpaper was the nicest I found but would rather something more abstract than trees. In my head it's got dark dragons on, but haven't found anything that works how I want it. Obviously the curtains need changing as well... What else?

Oh, eventually I want to have some sort of hidden lighting, maybe strip lights behind shelves or something. That'll come in the future as I save up, so any great ideas feel free to think of something quite out there that I could build up to! I love technology... I'll have a full stereo system and what not in there round the TV as well (along with a proper TV stand rather than a speaker cabinet! The amps will probably move downstairs).

I'll shut up now. What do you all think? Thank you!",,False,,t5_2ux9b,False,,,True,t3_1hvjgx,http://www.reddit.com/r/DesignMyRoom/comments/1hvjgx/help_decorating_living_room_looking_for/,

I'm trying to get some advice prior to moving in to see if there is anything I should purchase prior to my move in date (Mid July). I know this is limited information...but I was hoping you could kind of 'visualize' what I'm going for with the layout and pictures I provided below

Hey Everyone!

First off, thanks in advance for taking a look at my post.

So I'm moving in to my first one bedroom apartment in Midtown Manhattan. I already have most of my furniture, and (sadly) a lot of it are the standard IKEA 'modern' malm looks that everyone has.

I'm going to replace and upgrade as I go...but right now I'm working with what I have.

As you'll see, I like a very modern a darker look. Grey's and blacks.

If it matters, I'm a 28 year old straight male. Going for a typical bachelor pad look.

I want to paint my room and style it somewhat after [this apartment](http://www.apartmenttherapy.com/robs-flooded-with-life-small-cool-contest-190201)



So [here](http://i.imgur.com/TxhTCDs.jpg) is a layout of my apartment roughly to scale.

The couch is a black leather couch in an L shape as you can see. It's similar to [this design](http://image.ec21.com/image/carolynlong/OF0008055245_1/Sell_designer_Knoll_L_shape.jpg) but without the metal or round pillows

The bed is the [IKEA malm bed](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/S39849855/#/S79849844)
with end tables attached on to it. In black/brown

The bookcase is the [Ikea Billy] (http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/83688210/#/40071788)
in black brown

The desk is the [Ikea Malm Dresser](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/10203610/) in black/brown 

The coffe table is the [Ikea Klubbo](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/80135019/) in black brown 

The letters are where I'm going to hang my ""Art"" (I use that term loosely trust me). I have very nice black frames which I'll be putting the following pictures in

[A](http://www.allposters.com/-sp/Bloodbeat-I-Posters_i7617658_.htm)

[B](http://www.allposters.com/-sp/Bloodbeat-II-Posters_i7617659_.htm)

[C](http://www.allposters.com/-sp/Princess-of-China-Posters_i9467414_.htm)

D - Custom Graffiti style print I have. Can post a picture if you need.

The TV is a 46 inch Aquos. Seeing as it's a bit far away to view from the couch/bed with a swivel mount I'll be upgrading to a 60-65 inch eventually.

Also...I'll be hiding my desktop PC and television components in the closet next to the desk. For a cleaner look of the monitor and wireless keyboard/mouse on my desk and TV on the wall. I'll wire it all up, and I discussed that in another thread [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/hometheater/comments/1ghbmq/question_about_connecting_all_my_components/) if it matters.

I'm looking for any tips on the layout, if I should modify how I have laid out the furniture or whatnot. From what I gather, the way I set it all up is really the only way to position the furniture. The couch being an L shape with the lounger on the left hand side limits my options.

I'm also looking on how to add color. I was thinking of adding a shag rug similar to what the guy in the link I posted did and matching decorative pillows on the couch to. 

Also, my bed spread on the malm is typically black (shocker I know)..but I'm open to changing that. Someone had suggested going super bright and doing an orange or yellow but that really doesn't fit me. I was thinking of just introducing grays or whites in with the pillows/bedspread and rug.

I HATE the color scheme in my room! I want lighter colors on the walls, a different color carpet, different window treatments, etc. I like beachy colors (blue, light tan, green) and don't want anything dark that would make the room look smaller.

http://i.imgur.com/NG5tNd3.png

My room is pretty small, 9x9, might be 10x10. I have two windows, a closet and a radiator in front of one of the windows. 

Some notes - I'm a 22 year old college student and I feel very constricted by my lack of space at home. In order to open up more space I have a floor futon as a bed which I can just roll up and push aside during the day, opening up a lot of floor space. 

I have 3 tall bookcases and two normal, shorter bookcases. I'm hoping I can downsize on this a bit. I also have a desk. I can fit two tall bookcases and the desk on one wall. 

My room is also this odd pink color..  I was hoping to be able to repaint my room but I am not sure what color to paint it. I was originally thinking a light green but now I am thinking of a light gray and then adding pops of color in the room.

NOTE : all of my furniture is black / black woodgrain. 

I also have a 40 inch flatscreen tv that I currently have on top of one of my short bookcases. I would like to wall mount it if possible but I am not sure yet if my wall will have the proper place for me to do this. (cross beams I mean)

Unfortunately, I'm the stereotypical bachelor, and I don't have many people to give me advice (read: stop me from making my apartment look like it was designed by an electronics store salesman).

For starters, the room just has a computer desk, chair and filing cabinet.  [Here is the floor plan and some pictures](http://imgur.com/a/tBv61) of the already in place furniture.  Don't worry; all the stuff, except the desk, chair, and filing cabinet, is going to be gone soon enough.  I'm still moving in.

Unfortunately, the floor plan does not have dimensions.  I measured the wall with the window to be about 12.5ft, and the distance from that wall to the kitchen is about 17.5ft.  Also, the floor plan is actually flipped!

I'd really like to have a nice living room to hang out in with friends.  I want to have a comfy couch facing the fire place (that will probably also have a TV over it in the future) and enough extra seating so that I could have maybe six people hanging out.

Here's where I need help: I'm not even sure what style of furniture to be thinking about, or how I should lay it out!  One idea I had was to get a right-angle sofa with one arm against the wall opposite the fireplace and the other arm creating a partial wall between the living room and ""dining"" areas.

I’m hoping you can help me pick a great color for the master bathroom. We’ve recently painted the bedroom [Benjamin Moore Gray Horse]( http://www.benjaminmoore.com/en-us/paint-color/grayhorse) and love it. However, now I’m in a bit of a pickle. You see, we’d really like to find a nice color for the bathroom that’s a bit lighter for the bathroom, but I’m concerned it might not work with the current color scheme. The bathroom has cherry vanities and a bit of orange tile work to throw in the mix. I did try using the Sherwin Williams tool from the sidebar, but without much love.

Primarily, I want the view from the master to not be “jarring” – meaning the colors need to play nice with one another. And secondly, the color needs to work with the tile and cabinets since I have no plans to replace them. Again, I'd like to keep the bathroom bright, so lighter colors are preferred.

I’ve posted some pictures from a few different angles – sorry for the quality, but it was the best I could manage this morning.

Kitchen/Family - http://tinypic.com/r/15nxbg1/6 , http://tinypic.com/r/oj301w/6

Here I was thinking to extend the granite counter on the island so we could add some barstools to the end , probably a barstool in a camel color.

For the family room, i was thinking to make this into a TV room, just a big sectional and an entertainment center for most family activity.

I'm limited on money to around $300-500. I would prefer to keep the couch, chair, and TV. I like my coffee table as it has a white board top, but if you have better suggestions, I would be willing to part with it.

I have an artistic friend who said he could paint me a mural on the wall with the window to the kitchen. I was thinking a Nashville skyline (as its where I live). Would this work or be tacky?

The first thing I want to do is paint the walls, but I have no idea what color to do. I was kinda thinking painting 3 walls and leaving the wall that leads back into the hall way white, or maybe some other neutral color. 

Its a rental so I don't want to change the carpet, but I do plan on living here for a long time... so it is a possibility in the future (my landlord was talking about doing hard wood when I move out).

I study Game Design at a lovely school in the Netherlands. The classes are great, the teachers are brilliant, but the rooms are awful. 

They are big, with old grey furniture and concrete walls. Half of the walls are painted white, the other half hasn't been touched. The ceiling is part ceiling tiles, part concrete and pipes. It looks like a communist workcamp. 

A few months ago our department lead asked for volunteers to redesign one of the classrooms. I got in, along with four others and one very nosy teacher. We have a budget of €400, excluding paint. We can basically do whatever we feel is right, under certain terms: We have a color pallet to keep ourselves to and it can't seem like all we do is play videogames all day. They hinted for a retro arcade/8bit theme. Which is probably the best option. The color pallet is really wide ranged, and our school is indeed pretty colorful. They have a wall full of pokemons in a room above ours. 

Current ideas: Couch or some sort of lounge, stools, floor stickers with a pac-man maze, pegs on the wall.

I was wondering if you had any good ideas, especially with this theme. I don't have acces to floorplans and photos right now, but I will post them in an edit if someone asks. 

Nothing is too crazy, this is your chance to design the ultimate videogame inspired room! :D

Our room has the exact same mismatch of furniture, except we don't have computers. Only screens. And we have to share a whiteboard with four other classrooms. And it has more concrete.

* The [hallway](http://foto.glu.nl/opendag_januari_2012/content/images/large/DSC_0020.jpg) that borders our classroom. Lots of red.

Currently have no furniture other than the bed which is in place as shown. No kitchen units either so feel free to tell me to put the dining table in the living area and do something living areay with the dining room.

Plug sockets are shown although the ground level one in the kitchen area is actually a socket for an oven. Water outlet is directly under the sink to the right of the planned washing machine. There is also a cold water outlet in the corner on the other side of the bathroom door.

The tiles are more or less to scale and are 0.3x0.6 metres.

If you can find me a space for 42 inch TV and at least two loudspeakers you are a wizard, also if you can put a computer desk in there as well as sofa. (I already own these, and was into home theatre before I moved here.)

Hi, r/DesignMyRoom.  I'm looking to redo my 23'x10' media room/office/mancave (hate that word...) in our Philadelphia rowhome -- album with photos is above.  Style-wise, I find that I like simple and clean looking, but I hate the coldness of minimalist designs and prefer the warmth of arts &amp; crafts.  I guess something more like this is a good representation:  http://www.houzz.com/photos/82394/Sterling-Pointe-Redesign-traditional-media-room-charlotte

The first three photos are from the listing when we bought the home.  The structure of the room is exactly the same now, though the furniture is obviously different, except for the bookshelves, which are built-in, and the radiator/covering

The second two pictures are a couple mock-ups, which include me blowing out the ceiling and vaulting it to the level of the pitched roof (see the shot from the outside to see the pitch).  The sofa and TV in the mock-ups are there for an idea of how I currently to arrange this room, so it's negotiable.  And yes, I do plan on getting 3 televisions, as I watch TV, game, and use my computer all at the same time fairly often, and I'd also utilize the TVs for gaming nights with friends and ridiculous sports watching. 

The last photo is of the southern face of the room to show the pitch of the roof, which I think I've eyeballed to 3/12 or 4/12 before.


Skill-wise, I'm fairly capable, and I have friends and family that can help me do most anything, though I don't want to get into structural changes (but stuff like electricity, pulling new wires, and rerouting the radiator are all well within our capabilities.  

Budget-wise, I'm looking to do the room for $5000 or less, including the electronics.  I currently plan on building and upholstering the sofa myself.  I'd love to make it a (faux?)leather sofa, but I've never worked with raw leather before, so I don't know what issues I'd run into there.  

I don't know if it's a good idea to blow up the ceiling to open the room up a little, or if the gain of a 3/12 or 4/12 pitch isn't worth it.  I also am absolutely **terrible** at design, which is why I'm coming to you guys!


Any help here is greatly appreciated.  Design principles, specific Houzz links or creative ways to search (I've spent a lot of time on that site to no avail), or even just color choices would be awesome.  

Thanks!

I am moving into my very first studio apartment! I am ridiculously excited to decorate it (I've been online window shopping all week) but I've come to realize that I am artistically hopeless and I have no idea what I'm doing!

I was hoping that maybe some of you could help! I'll try to include as much info as possible.

[Here is a picture of the studio apartment](http://i.imgur.com/8cemdoI.jpg). Except, the walls are white, not yellow. Also they're putting new carpet in, so I'm not sure what color it will be. The bathroom is purple. 

[Here are some decorative things](http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/ref=gno_listpop_wi) that I've found on Amazon that I would possibly like to incorporate into the apartment.

**About me:** I am a 21 year old female university student and I just got a tiny little studio apartment in the ""hip"" part of town. I am thinking that I want a sort of... shabby chic/vintage/antique look to the room. Antique coffee pictures in the kitchen, a shabby chic [desk like this](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-lj2etBSBQsQ/TV2gimKwFAI/AAAAAAAABbk/JW3v0lnji3E/s1600/EPF-shabby+desk+008.jpg), etc.

Things that I like: coffee, cats, photography, Spanish/Spain, travel, cooking/baking

I like pretty much all colors except for orange. 


Any help is super appreciated!


Edit: I saw someone else's post, and I love pretty much all of the furniture. Especially the vintage looking TV stand, the chest, and the table in front of the couch.

It has a small storage closet for my clothes and such. Do you guys have any suggestions for how to maximize the usability of the space? I'd like to keep it as clean and simple as possible (You could say minimalist). My requirements are:

* Queen size bed, not placed against a wall

* Table or shelf along wall for my stereo to sit at ear level and keep my laptop off the floor when not in use.

My first thought was [this bed](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/S49931618/#/S19931634) with some drawers underneath (I need a queen bed, anything else is too short and hard to shop for). The idea being that the bed would allow me to eliminate the need for a dresser. I also wanted to add a small side table along a wall for my stereo.

My most recent thought was the forgo traditional furniture and get a [ Japanese Futon](http://www.jlifeinternational.com/houseitems/futon/shikifuton/shikifuton_e.html) that could be folded up and stored in the closet or a corner during the day. I could place my stereo system on a short table off the floor and have some big sitting pillows (Hell, two big dog beds would work). 

How can I get as much function as possible out of this small room? If I forgot anything (I can't take pictures as I have yet to move in) I'll try to answer as many comments as I can. I am in college, so if it can be done cheaply (Ikea budget) thats ideal, but I can splurge a bit on my living space.

I currently own a pretty expensive coil mattress (think $2,000) and I hate it. I've had it for 5 years and I'd like to switch to a futon which I have much better experiences with.(friend's house, and one hotel i go to). I sleep like a log, and my back feels much better in the morning.

The reason I paid so much for my current mattress is because coil mattresses come in all sorts of flavors and levels of quality, and figured I needed the best. Not a big deal.

But when I think about foam mattresses, I can't help but think that the product itself must be as simple as it sounds (foam?) and that a $1,000 piece of foam might not be better than a $400 piece of foam from IKEA. 
It's possible that the more expensive ones might layer the foam or use more durable materials, but in general are all foam mattresses of similar firmness and approximate level of material quality just as comfortable as the other regardless of extra bells and whistles?",,False,,t5_2ux9b,False,,,True,t3_1hwdb9,http://www.reddit.com/r/DesignMyRoom/comments/1hwdb9/ikea_foam_mattress_vs_traditional_futons/,

My girlfriend and I just moved into a loft downtown and we are having a hell of a time figuring out how to furnish the living room. 

[Here](http://imgur.com/a/H9sDQ) is the floor plan and some pictures.

The coffee table and bowl chair are temporary and I would love to get rid of them. I also want the kitchen table out of here but my girlfriend doesn't like that idea. I hate how we have basically 3 different colors of wood mixed in right now.

Some of the things I would like to do that I would love suggestions on:

* A 65"" or 70"" TV will be going on the wall opposite of where the couch is right now. I would love some suggestions on something to put the TV on that's very shallow.
* A fairly large bookcase on the brick wall to the left of where the lamp is now
* A loveseat or chair and a half perpendicular to the couch. So running parallel to the brick wall in front of the bookcase.

Besides that, I would love any other suggestions you guys have. I don't really know exactly what style I'm going for. I guess something that sort of fits the rustic feel of the unit, but still with a modern touch. The ceilings are ~13' if that's relevant at all.

I've got a studio type apartment that I've been contemplating repainting in a few varying shades of blue and gray with bright white accents on moulding and built-in shelving units. Generally speaking, the shape of the studio is like a capital 'I'; Two larger spaces connected by a short hall with an entrance at one of the ends. Does anyone know how to avoid making my already limited space smaller? And does my idea sound like one that might shrink the feel of my home?
To expand on the look, it is currently almost all in an off-white gray. My idea is to start with a relatively (but not very) darker gray-blue towards the entrance/kitchen and work into a lighter gray as you move into the bed/living space. Moulding at the base and around windows, as well as a few built-in shelves, to be painted a brighter white. Also a possibility is one wall in the living area to be a contrasting splash wall.
If unclear I can further elaborate or post pictures if necessary. 
Thanks!

Built in the late 40s, it was originally a symmetrical duplex and was converted to a single residence in the 80s. Because it was symmetrical and then remodeled as a single res, there are some strange things. Some rooms are narrow, there are windows in odd places, etc. Exterior shots in [this album](http://imgur.com/a/BjtFF#0) just for fun.

The reason I mention it's unusual  layout is because I'm thinking of switching the flow of the house in an unconventional way. 

The main area of the house is very open. The kitchen is open, opposite is the dining area/computer desk, and then adjacent is the tiny living room. The living room/dining space is 25'x10'. Long and narrow and the front door opens up right into the living room. No entry way, no mudroom. Just opens up and boom, there's the tv, couch, coffee table, welcome in.

I hate that the computer and living space are separated by the dining table. But we can't move the computer desk into the living space because of the space constraints/not wanting to put a desk in front of floor-to-ceiling windows.

**HERE'S MY IDEA:**

I want to put the dining space in the smaller, front room and make a sort of den/living space back with the computer where the dining space was. Here is a rough, but to scale, sketch of the [current layout](http://i.imgur.com/H2hc84y.png) (pretending that my kitchen is finally remodeled), and a sketch of the [way I'd like to lay it out instead.](http://i.imgur.com/iFBAkoX.png)

Once you've seen the sketches, here are some more of my thoughts:

* The big couch. It has to go. It was great when we first got it, but it's HUGE. Our house was made when things were tiny. And I like it like that. The second, smaller couch (and old-time camel-back) would become the main couch. I like its daintiness.

* The dining table is really more like my sewing table/my husband's D&amp;D table.. I keep most supplies out of sight (can't leave them out unless I want some cats up in that biz) and really the dining area is like a dining/multi-use space. Right now it's all up in the computer's biz.

* We use the computer for television JUST AS MUCH as we use the television. I *hate* watching our shows at the dining table/from a distance. I want the swap mainly so it will be the entertainment space all in one area.

* The kitchen is still very open. The 12"" deep cabinets lined up against the kitchen counter are 40"" high, effectively a raised bar. The flat-screen tv would go underneath that bar sandwiched between the two high-bar cabinets.  

Thoughts? All CCW welcome, even new ideas I maybe didn't think of.

You’ll notice in my pictures that there is this hideous brown carpet… well, that will be gone. Once the rest of the house is livable again, we will move out of the living room and they will be pulling up the carpet and refinishing those floors as well.

Since we are spending our money on floors at first, it means no new couch. We actually love our couch because it’s comfortable but it’s navy blue.. and we have had no luck in finding anything that matches it that doesn’t seem like it’s a nautical theme. So for starters, the couch has to stay for a couple more years, but we want to avoid a nautical theme if at all possible. Outside of that, we don’t have any other ideas of what we want/don’t want are completely open to ideas. My wife and I use this room for for lounging around and playing with our 6 month old son Wes. When we do entertain, this space will be used, but that isn’t at the top of the list since life is very family focused with a 6 month old around. We want it to be able to be 6 month old friendly and comfy enough for us to relax and take a deep breath once he goes to bed.

We have no idea what our style is. If a gun was put to my head and I was forced to answer I would say that I know we aren’t into antique stuff or ultra-modern furniture. I did the style finder on HGTV and it said I was Crafted Simplicity (whatever that means). We’re looking for paint color help, rug advice, color scheme, entertainment center suggestions, and any other surprises you designers out there have.

I MAY get a a drawer or something like that if the closet can't fit all of my clothes (which it might not). Oh and the closet's kind of a mess but I'll post that separately after fixing up the room first.

Basically most of my furniture will be black of sorts.

The floor will most likely remain that way (just varnished) or I might get laminated flooring installed. The shade of the wood will remain about as light but the width will definitely be thicker.

**I would like a minimalist look. I'd basically like suggestions on just about everything. From placement, to color, to specific furniture, etc.**

Couple of caveats: I'd like the have a desk with large space for both computing and work and I cannot in good conscious ever place my computer on the ground. At the least it'll be on the desk itself.

She's suggested a few things, such as making the archway square and removing the fireplace surround but we both don't really have any clue where to begin. She'd really like ""to just do something, anything"" with the little niche to the right of the archway, she really doesn't like it, but again, we don't know what to do.

Help!

My housemate and I are both full-time engineers; after a long day we typically come home and both crash in this upstairs room we've just dubbed our ""rec room"". It was a bedroom to the previous owners, but we've just agreed to make it a mutual space. We both keep our computer desks in here, as well as a couch and the one TV we share.

He owns a dog that has difficulty walking across this hardwood floor, and I play guitar in here occasionally and sit on the floor. We'd like to get a rug to cover the middle of the floor in this room - between the two desks, in front of the couch and under the trunk in the middle of the room (which I move out of the way when I play guitar).

We're looking for suggestions for something under $200 if possible. The middle of the room would snugly fit an 8'x10' rug. I was thinking an Oriental/Persion rug, but am open to seeing other suggestions. Really we just need something that's comfy to walk on and ""ties the room together"". The couch is a dark brown and the trunk is sort of a marbled rosewood or something. The wooden floor itself I don't know the composition of; everything else in the room is painted a lite cream color that we don't want to repaint. The room gets plenty of light through the three windows in the back. We'll eventually be hanging some black-and-white music posters on the walls (The Clash, Johnny Cash, etc). We just really think a rug would make it all coalesce (in addition to help us move around without slipping).

My question relates to color schemes, room configuration and general decorating ideas. You can see in the photos samples of the light brown paint that I’m considering using on the (hideous) green walls. I know darker colors can make a space feel smaller but I figure it will go nicely with the teal-blue carpet. Also, the two large windows and freshly-painted white wall should help keep the space feel quite open. 

I also played around with the position of the couch and bed but finally decided it’s better if they each go length-wise. I might install another shelf in the closet area and maybe one on the white wall near my bed. I think I quite like that large blank space though.

I rent this place, but my landlord is pretty flexible. We're allowed to paint/make our own improvements within reason, as long as it's not too drastic.

Cable management

A good de-cluttering

Possibly a fresh look at some of the furnishings

One wall (the wall with the window) has the fusebox and a baseboard heater on it. The large closet with 3 doors is where our washer/dryer sits. The corner where the door and the laundry area meets is a little alcove.

This room has to be extremely functional, as well as comfortable, as it is the primary living space. It is used as eating space, working space, as well as for entertaining (which we do a lot of). So it needs to have lots of seating, as well as a surface to eat/work at (we are currently using an Ikea desk which we cannot wait to replace!). We also have a record player and stack of records which do not currently have a piece of furniture to house them, or a space for that furniture, so they need to be accounted for as well. 





Aesthetically, we are looking for simplicity, with pseudo-hunting lodge elements and beautiful, classic items as accessories. I know that's a bit vague, so here is the [bedroom](http://i.imgur.com/A4V6lRC.jpg) for comparison (the deer skull has since been mounted above the bed). 





Our budget is super small, under 1000euros. All the current furniture has been thrifted, as I am lucky enough to live in a city with great thrift stores. 





Any suggestions you may have about layout/pieces/colour scheme/style for the room would be greatly appreciated. The room needs a complete overhaul, but I'm all out of ideas.

Ideas so far:

* She tried wrapping them in a paper sleeve, but it took a lot of material for each one and looked ugly
* They could be placed on a thin piece of painted wood or cardboard  such that the board is dividing the tines, and then we could probably fit a bunch on each board.

I have a pretty nice home theater system so people come over to watch movies a lot; I was thinking that building my room around the TV would be a good idea. I took the stylefinder test and it says I prefer modern, which makes sense because I've always liked that really simplistic, sharp edged kind of look.

At the moment I am only looking to furnish the living room; the bedroom will come later. I live about 30 minutes from Ikea, 5 minutes from Wal-Mart. Other than that, I can order from Amazon or whatever. Keep in mind I'm a graduate student so I can't exactly spend a whole lot because I'm living off student loans :)

Here is the floor plan http://i.imgur.com/HKWs4fC.jpg

The room was completely unfurnished. The floor plan makes it look like there is a couch/coffee table etc already there but there isn't.

I also took a few pics of the junk I have in the room right now, maybe it will help.

I just bought my first house, that has a partially finished basement. The stuff in the pictures is how it's laid out now, but it will be bare when I move in.

There's sort of 2 rooms, and I'd like to break it up so one is more of an office and one is more my tv/videogame hangout. I'm into drawing and art so I may make the ""office"" part of my work area as well with a drawing table.

As of now I don't have much to put in there but please make suggestions on what kind of stuff to buy to put in there. Currently I have my tv (a 60 inch flatscreen), a stand for the tv, a futon, and a computer desk. 

As far as style. I prefer more classy looking, or simplistic, over something tacky and all out-sports. I'm a Steelers fan, but I don't want black and yellow everywhere. 

Here's some examples of what I like (obivously these are way more elaborate than what I'm going for but you get the idea)...

The fact is I barely use the space - my husband uses it the most - and I want to use it less because of how much I hate the way it looks. Also, we're renting and we plan on purchasing a home soon. My husband thinks we should either leave it as is (the desk is practically falling apart because we've already moved once with it from an apartment that had no designated office) or buy ""real"" furniture that we will take with us to our house. I just want to redesign the room on the cheap in a way that will make me use it while we are still living here. I intend to redesign the space in our hypothetical house when the time comes. Anyway, I'm going back to school and need more desk space, better organization, etc. 

Since we already inherently disagree about this, I would like to get a few ideas from you guys that I can present to him and hopefully we can reach a mutual agreement about this ""temporary"" office space. 

Here's the room now:

Basically, I'm looking for some room design ideas with different furniture that will provide more functional desk space as well as better organization (wall, filing cabinets, etc.). All the other furniture in our house is brown and I have a preference to doing the office in white which I know my husband hates. I'm willing to consider other options.

[Here's how it looks while empty, and with the desk I'm going to use (IKEA Galant 230 x 200 cm)](http://i.imgur.com/9gBPt.jpg)

I want to paint the walls in some color, and right now I feel like red is the color I like best.

While it's my favorite alternative right now, I'm curious, is there any reason I wouldn't want red as my wall color (only the two walls in the photo though), mostly related to overall mood and such? 

I'm a graphic designer, so the space is going to have to be visually stimulating. I'm not using it that much for work at the moment, but that's just the kind of atmosphere I like. I'm going to do a lot of the design myself, but as with most stuff of this nature, I'd really like to hear the opinions and ideas of others as well. I'm planning on using posters, props and plants to make a cozy space. This is going to be a gaming room (PC), so picture 2-3 monitors in the center of the corner piece. Most of the time it's going to be pretty dark and I'm planning on using either wall lights of some kind, [like in this picture](http://i.imgur.com/LUQND.jpg) or perhaps some kind of LED solution behind my monitors.

My biggest challenge is finding the atmosphere pieces (posters, props etc) since I haven't been looking for such before due to very limited desk space. Color and overall smart design ideas would be welcome as well, since I'm sure a lot of you have more experience with that than I do.

It's just me living here (Male, 25, employed) but my girlfriend basically lives here as well. I'm trying to get a bit of advice here because this is my first place on my own. This house has a strange layout but that was one of the reasons that I rented it, it has a lot of character for the money I'm paying. It's a two story house, about 800 square feet, not including the basement. I've included various pictures. Please note that none of the rooms are finished or the way that I want them, and pardon any mess you notice, I'm not done with the moving process or really settled at this point.

The couch is a Chesterfield that I had delivered yesterday. I want to kind of work with that, it's a little big for the room but I like it that way. I'm totally open to moving it wherever in the room, the spot I have it in now is just where the movers had set it. This might sound really stupid but I was going to put an area rug at the foot of the couch, I was thinking a cowskin like this: http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/60222932/ and then a coffee table of some kind. I want to get some ferns and things like that, I just don't know about the layout of the room, hard for me to get a feel for. The problem is that the bookshelf in the back corner is built into the wall so that kind of inhibits what I can do with the room, as well as the cellar doors, and the back door, they all need a little room. You can kind of see that all in the pictures. I have a surround sound system with 6 speakers and a TV stand that needs to go somewhere, but that's about it. I don't need a lot of furniture in the living area.

The kitchen is basically fine the way it is, I may replace the table with a smaller one, but other than that I'm mostly happy. 

Upstairs there are 3 rooms, the front bedroom (room with blue walls, being used as an office), the back bedroom (room with bed and closets) and bathroom. I didn't include pictures of the bathroom because it's pretty much set the way it is, no problems there. 

The front bedroom definitely needs seating of some kind, maybe a couch, art, something. I was going to get a carpet for it as well. Not sure. The bookshelf that is in there is not staying.  

The back bedroom, I don't really want much stuff in there. Underneath the built in shelves, I was going to put one of my Expedit IKEA shelves sideways, put casters on it and use it for record storage and put a turntable on the top of it, for bedroom listening. Other than that, some art, plants, not sure what to do.

(That disgusting blue couch is leaving.. I am considering keeping the white ikea couch/bed though.. The color of the couch can be easily changed by buying the different shades of upholstery at ikea) 

I've just recently purchased this apartment and it came newly renovated with what I believe are white oak floorpanels and several beech wood walls. I currently live in Hong Kong the apartment so apartments are a way of life.. It's a 30 year old apartment block.. and I will be living there with my gf.

I'm a bit confused as to how I should be addressing my furniture. Especially with two types of wood that seem to dominate everything....

* Should I be picking items that are more neutral like white/grey/black to draw away from the heavy impact of wood in the house? 

* Or should I be choosing vibrant colors to contrast the wood? 
* Or...?

I would love your 5 cents please advise me on how I should be purchasing my furniture.. I will probably be buying most articles if not all from Ikea so if you have a particular piece of furniture in mind please feel free to link. Whatever advice though whether it be color schemes, how to paint the walls, etc. Would be greatly appreciated! 

Thanks :D!

I know a 900 sqft 2 bedroom apartment doesn't leave a lot of room for a minimalistic look. I'll be working and she'll be starting college.

We'll be starting out with nothing (no furniture) which opens some room for flexibility (but also causes headaches in shopping decisions) There are two big factors which will be affecting our design/layout: We might be moving several times from renting apartments until we can afford to buy our own place (so I'd like to have as little furniture as possible, and whatever is purchased needs to be movable) and we rarely watch movies/shows on an actual TV.

It'll be great if you all have any suggestions (For furniture/layout) and thoughts on my plan below:

* Not planning to have a TV, so I'm thinking of leaving out getting a sofa, a  TV table, coffee table, etc
* In place of where all the stuff above usually goes, I plan to get 2 tables (hopefully with wheels like [these](http://www.flickr.com/photos/thomas83/5740973933/in/set-72157626767455664/) ) where each of us will have our own workstation computer
* Using tables-on-wheels, we can have the stations facing back-to-back when gaming, put them together into one long desk if one of us isn't at home/doesn't need to use it, and roll one table with a 27 inch monitor to face the dining table for watching shows
* Total furniture: 2 workstation tables, 1 dining table, 2 work office chairs (which could double as dining chairs?)

Also, assuming we might move around for quite a bit (maybe once every 1 or 2 years), would it be advisable to buy expensive work chairs (such as the HM Aeron, which I understand comes assembled from the store) and furniture in general? Or get cheap furniture until we settle down?

Budget: I'd like to keep it less than $500-600, and I'm definitely not opposed to buying used/repurposing.

As the title says, I'm trying to overhaul my bedroom.  I'm still living with my parents and unfortunately it's looking like I have to stay here for at least 6-8 months, at most, well, hopefully a year.

My parents decided that in between me moving out and moving back in, they'd replace the carpet.  So, I got rid of a TON of stuff and moved some things back in, but I'm only keeping it in my room because there's nowhere else to put it; it's leaving eventually, I think.

I like a modern living space, and I believe that your living space should make your life easier.  I'm into using the computer, gaming (although mostly computer gaming), weightlifting, and paintball (the black duffel bag you'll see).  I really like the look of Ikea furniture, but they seem all about storage space, whereas I don't like storing things.  Everything that's in the room is what I own, but I'd say at least half of what's in there is going (donating, yard sales, etc.).

So, before I go too far, here are the pictures:

http://imgur.com/a/MkkBW#11  I linked to one of the photos in the album because that's the floor plan.  It's crudely drawn by myself (1/4"" = 1ft if you can see the grid markings, it's about 400sqft).  I screwed up with the main door, everything else is accurate.  The one across the bed is the front door, the one to the left is a closet, and to the right is a bathroom.  On the right-hand side wall from this image, there is a glass door leading outside.  On the left, there is a bay window.  Finally, the wall opposite the door has a space just wide enough for the bed to fit in, so I kept it that way.  Of course, I'm open to ideas.

Note about the clutter: if it's on top of a surface, it's getting donated/sold at a yard sale/going to a friend.

Now, what I was thinking was keeping the couch where it is (in the other pictures), and instead of that dresser that's in front of it (which isn't staying), putting an entertainment center for the TV.  The couch is broken, though, so it's not staying, but we already used our ""large item pickup"" this month so it's just in my room for now.  The ""Matrix"" poster is also leaving, but I have a framed photograph that's going there.

If you're facing the window, to the left I'm thinking of putting a bar for my alcohol and whey protein.  That bulletin board is leaving, but again, no room anywhere else yet.  I was thinking [something simple like this](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/00185584/), or maybe some hanging shelves above a wooden plank attached to the wall.  The shelves would just house a tub or two of protein, maybe 5-6 alcohol bottles, some glasses and my shaker cups.  Adjacent to that (whichever wall the bar isn't on) I'm thinking of hanging a painting I have.

The shelves under the window fit pretty nicely and I have my games on the right hand side (top shelf) and my protein/supplement stuff on the bottom shelf along with a couple office supplies.  To the right of the shelves is just stuff for eBay.  I don't sell on eBay that much so I don't want a dedicated space, but it's there temporarily.

My computer desk is where I spend a lot of my time and wow I just realized how awful that towel looks on the chair, but it's super comfortable.  For a desk I was thinking [this Galant desk](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/S99806947/#/S79836969) from Ikea.  I don't like the Micke one I have now, it's not bad but I can't lean back and this aggravates my knees (bad knees from playing hockey and paintball).  

So, that leaves the back-right corner if you were standing in front of the entrance door.  I'm not sure what to do with that.  Sorry the dresser drawer is open, it recently broke and doesn't close.  Also, the bookshelf is half-empty (or half-full, depending on how you look at it).  I could pack most of those away, but that just leaves me with even less in the room.

I can't paint the walls and the rug is a strange brownish color (which I didn't pick), and you can see in one of the pictures the color of my sheets compared to my comforter and the floor.  The flowery blue comforter is a down one that my gf lent me because it got really cold here and we haven't turned the heat on (whereas she has), so that's temporary.

(TL;DR) All in all, I'm really just looking for things to fill up the room.  It feels a little sparse and I'm really looking for ideas that I can do that'd look cool and be fun to do.  I'd appreciate any suggestions.",,False,,t5_2ux9b,1349813970.0,,,True,t3_117nr3,http://www.reddit.com/r/DesignMyRoom/comments/117nr3/almostcomplete_bedroom_overhaul_some_help_please/,

I would rather not go too matchy-matchy with the look. And not too dark and heavy. The room gets really good light, so we're thinking of keeping the feeling of the room bright and airy.

So we have recently updated our apartment taking out all the dark (red and black) decor touches and replacing with fresh yellow and green to try brighten the place up and some key style touches. - wish i had before pics, but i don't.
We own the apartment and we have dark furniture. The carpet is ruined cause our puppy pee'd all over it and it was a rental prior to us getting it, so we are going to add a vintage grey oak floorboard instead - here is a pic of floorboards - http://www.floorboardsonline.com.au/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/l/p/lpu1286_qslargo_interior-470x470.jpg This should lighten the place up a lot.
1 of things we are thinking is to replace the coffee table with something thats a bit more see through so it opens the space up. here is what it would like with just glass and industrial base (i used glass from existing table just for an idea of how it looks). - here is the pic - http://i.imgur.com/GT6UW67h.jpg
Also, we want to change the chairs of the table to something more modern, perhaps white like these tolix replicas. http://cdn1.bigcommerce.com/server3400/9la52efk/products/58/images/180/Rep_Tolix_Chair_WHI2__78309.1358827087.1280.1280.jpg
We love the current industrial/modern vibe mixed with a bit of vintage flair that is currently in at the moment.
So here are my questions...
1) How would you improve this space to look more styled, open and brighter? 2) Any designs tips, furniture movement? 3) what coffee table would you go with? 4) What chairs do you suggest for dining table? 5) what would you do with our godawful dark brown square shelving uni serving as bar. 6) next to the shelving unit/bar there is a lamp with no lamp shade. any ideas on a new lamp, or what sort of shade to put? 7) Prints?

In about a month I'll be moving in with my girlfriend and I'm planning the living room at the moment and I think I got the basic layout for the room down. So now it's about the colors and the style of the room.

[This](http://i.imgur.com/ryHYEpj.jpg)  is a floor plan I made with SketchUp and[ this](http://i.imgur.com/YqylIXo.jpg)  is the layout I had in mind for the furniture (don't mind the wallcolor, I was trying a few things out) and [here](http://i.imgur.com/0nhTyoN.jpg)  is a picture of a part of the room, so you can see the color of the floor.

The room will be used as living and eating space, the smaller room to the right is the kitchen. Under the window is a radiator.

A big problem for me is the greyish floor, because I can't seem to find a color scheme that fits it (I have to say I was mainly trying out the colors from pics of the IKEA website and apartment therapy). Another problem with the colors is that I'm a little Red/Green-blind. Everything I did just felt like it doesn't quite come together.

Do you have any advice or ideas for me? Styles I like are [Warm Industrial](http://www.apartmenttherapy.com/categories/warm-industrial) or [Organic Modern](http://www.apartmenttherapy.com/categories/organic-modern). The price range is, well, IKEA-like. We can paint the walls.

I have a 46"" TV that I am thinking of wall mounting, with a smaller sort of cabinet/entertainment center underneath it on the long wall (as seen in the planner) or on the wall shared with the bedroom - not sure which would work out better, layout wise.

There is already wiring done in the ceiling in both the living room and bedroom if I want to go for some sort of ceiling light fixture or fan (I'm located in Tampa, FL, so it's pretty warm).  Otherwise, I'm thinking of either floor lamps or end tables with lamps on them.

For the walls, I am able to paint any color I want to, so I was thinking of maybe going for an accent wall.  Any thoughts on that?

For the kitchen, I'm thinking of two stools at the sort of small breakfast bar area, along with something for that long wall.

I'd love this sub's take on how I could make this modern studio feel cozier and suit my style better. [Here](http://imgur.com/a/fUhw0) is the album with floor plan and a picture of the model studio. I can take pictures of the actual apartment so you can have a 'blank' canvas, if needed.

If anyone has suggestions on layout, that would be greatly appreciated as well! I have the following to work with:
-Leather couch that folds out into full sized bed

-[IKEA Expedit 2x4 shelf in white](https://encrypted-tbn2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSOomdS7wzgQvJnfHfIFq5imSAQrQC_lT8vU34TgZGG3dGjCFn9)

-IKEA Aspelund 2-drawer dresser (most likely putting inside the closet to fit all my swimsuits and things)

-[IKEA ODDA 3-drawer dresser](https://encrypted-tbn1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTZ9Obxo9UZuIHEWD2JxZyzxgf6F9nnsUHewKZHG1Iyn7-2s8TtKA)


I'm open to getting rid of/adding new furniture and definitely need more decor ideas. I would ideally like to buy a queen or full sized bed to fit in here too. The colors intended for the apartment seem too dark for my liking. Here's a [Pinterest](http://pinterest.com/urachka/bedroom-inspirations/) to give you an idea of what my tastes really are.

I want this space to feel more like a master bedroom with seating &amp; TV than a livingroom with a bed. Won't be doing much entertaining within the apartment since the complex has great spaces for that.

So tell me, can we make this happen in a small modern studio?

Thanks everyone in advance! :)

I would like to stay with earth tones and muted colors, but Im tired of all my walls and carpets being beige!!! 

1. I was thinking of getting a high or semi gloss white for all the molding. Is this a good idea?
2. What color should I paint the room?
3. Should I paint the ceiling plain white? (Ill probably paint the ceiling when I install the fan)
4. Should I put come crown molding around the closet? 
5. Is there a better way to arrange the furniture?
6. I obviously need some art on the walls. I guess that will come later. But where would be a good place to put it

My wife and I just purchased our first home, a short sale. The floors were trashed and we've always wanted to tackle remodeling. We knew when we walked into the house to view it for the first time we wanted to buy it and knock out a wall and closet between the kitchen and the living room to open it up. So we did just that.

Now we are struggling with how to layout the kitchen and what finishes and color schemes to go with. I've put 7 different layouts in the first album, those are the ones we've come up with and we are leaning towards #7.

We are also leaning towards light green walls, a white painted shaker style cabinet with a light to medium dark counter top. We're also trying to decide on flooring. So far we are leaning towards a darker brown with a minimal grain. We also have animals so we are looking at laminate or vinyl planks.

To give an idea of what we have in mind I rendered the last kitchen layout with sketchup: http://imgur.com/a/FaiMl

I recently purchased an apartment in Melbourne (Australia) and am moving in in the next few weeks. However, being a clueless IT male i suck at interior decorating and have no artistic flair. At all.

Help me choose furniture/layout/colour for the living room. At the moment I am thinking of some kind of sofa with separate ottoman, coffee table and cabinet for the TV. 

My concern is that it kind has to go with the kitchen, as at the moment I am not that keen on fully remodelling the flat. I imagine changing the granite kitchen counter would be a pain.

If you click [this link](http://imgur.com/a/30yPx) you will find pictures of how my bedroom is currently set up. I want to paint, add furniture and possibly rearrange furniture if you think it will work better. Excuse the mess, most of it is my girlfriends

**Colour scheme**
I had trouble finding a picture of the colour scheme I wanted, the closest I could find is [this](http://imgur.com/UEl4p4M).

If you refer back to the images of my bedroom, I would like to change what is currently brown to a colour similar to the grey I provided earlier, possibly darker, in what some places call  a suede texture. 

The rest of the walls I would like to do in a more of a white, perhaps eggshell. The pictures may not do it justice but the walls are currently a crème/latte colour and I would prefer something lighter.

The cornice (currently weird green/grey) as well as the ceiling will also be given a fresh coat of white paint. 
I am unsure how to tackle the little study nook.

**Furniture**

[Malm low bed frame in black/brown](http://www.ikea.com/au/en/catalog/products/S79871279/#/S89871306)

At least 1, possibly 2 bed side tables like this or [this](http://www.ikea.com/au/en/catalog/products/80158124/) from the malm series, or [this](http://www.ikea.com/au/en/catalog/products/00158222/). Having trouble deciding. 

And a low TV cabinet to store my dvd’s and games from the[besta series](http://www.ikea.com/au/en/catalog/products/00247657/#/00218443).

And finally instead of having those crappy brown curtains, I was thinking of put a dark coloured blind thing instead.

*hope the dark black brown of the malm series doesn’t clash with the floor etc, open to suggestions*

**Decorations**
As the main wall colours are an off white eggshell and the feature wall will be suede textured grey of sorts. I was thinking of adding a bit of colour by using cushions, canvases and such in possibly a blue colour with hints of denim. Like a denim cushion or lamp shade. Or a stressed and artificially aged denim canvas on the feature wall. When it comes to this department, im really needing some advice. But would love to use denim in some way.

Thanks for reading and any help, advice and suggestions would be very much appreciated!

- The beam in the master bedroom is structural. What can I put on it / on either side of it to make good use of that space?

- I don't know anything about different types of wall art / carpeting / ways to theme the place.

- Any advice on cheap storage solutions? Specifically book/media shelves for a bedroom?

I have no furniture  from a previous place, so everything I'll bring in will be brand new, so LINKS TO AWESOME FURNITURE WILL BE APPRECIATED.

So census has voted no on my bamboo walling part, and the stripes are on the fence now as well. Since I was unable to get pictures previously, I hope they'll be able to help this time. In the album there are 4 before pictures and 4 after pictures of progress so far. @_@ It's not an easy room to work with at all. I hoped that whatever way the top gets painted, that it'll at least make the room feel bigger. 

This room is basically a gaming/chilling/study room for two college students. The desks are black/brown on the top with silver legs. (they're in one of the before pictures) There wont be a couch in this room, maybe a small two seated futon later though. The bottom of the walls are gunmetal grey but actually just looks like a glossy traditional Grey. If someone asked what color it is, i'd simply just say grey, and would get no arguments. It's THAT kind of grey. We had to paint the border white....again and now all that's left is the area that I wanted to have a design for. Oh, that random stripe of light blue is/was one of the colors we're working with. I wanted to try to keep the original blue color, as its not terrible, there was just so much of it. And I wanted to accent it with that light blue. 

BTW, the paint is dry....the owner of the house just left us with this glossy industrial paint to work with and for two broke college students, we didn't turn it away. Note on Industrial paint: It's great to work with, but a pain in the ass to clean and the fumes are awful. TIL.

**Planner 5D:** https://planner5d.com/view/?key=ff4fd2f4ba45c7ef8c8e9a80e4960a83

Okay, accidentally deleted my previous post so I’m making this new one for all the details I was asked to provide in the last one…

**About Me:** Single 20-something full-time engineer. Enjoys heavy metal music, science, DIY projects and bicycling. I like to be active and can be messy at times, but also like to maintain a sense of personal style and am very much into organization. Also, I’m only 5’7” tall, so having tall things in the room doesn’t seem like my style. Style Finder says I’m “Classic Casual, aka Transitional – A mix of contemporary and traditional. Usually updated, graceful, and enduring.” My favorite color is dark blue, ~~and I happen to think that color would blend nicely into the rest of the room.~~ I'm open to other color inputs on what to use, I'm no longer adamant about keeping it.

**About My Room:** Planner 5D link above is fairly accurate to the room; yes, it is crooked in some places by a few inches. Beige carpet, cream-colored walls with white trim/accents. I really don’t want to bother repainting it at this point. My room in the house is from the original structure, so most of the walls will be made of plaster (?) rather than drywall; I was told it’s probably not a good idea to hang heavy things from nails on the walls. 

Ceiling is only 82 inches, but I don’t mind trimming down curtains to fit if needed. Windows all face the street and neighborhood, and I do change in here so I’ll need curtains that are functional so my neighbors don’t get a free show. The room also includes a boarded up fireplace that I’d much rather not emphasize; I don’t like it and I don’t care to try dolling it up.

**Add’l Furniture:** Existing furniture includes a standard queen bed, and a filing cabinet that houses all of my personal documents; other than that, everything is subject to change. I was thinking of at least getting a bedroom bench with storage (Options: [1](http://goo.gl/Vouhm), [2](http://goo.gl/XHlIA), [3](http://goo.gl/g3gxy), [4](http://goo.gl/WWjsT), [5](http://goo.gl/bQEKT)).

**Bed:** I ordered a sheet set because the current one, though I really like it, is King size and too big for the bed. Hopefully this one will be just as good, I welcome your thoughts:  http://goo.gl/hCH2s

**Curtains:** Something like these; could definitely use help in picking color, as well as color/style for curtain bar: http://goo.gl/p17en

**Décor:** Definitely looking for some posters/art to fill the room; I’m particular to things like engineering drawings and retro/“vintage” pieces, such as old maps and blueprints for Modern Marvel-type stuff (see examples in Imgur photo album). The room is well-lit enough by the windows and ceiling light, so I don't think I need any additional fixtures for that.


**EDIT:** formatting
**EDIT 2:** I've gotten a lot of creative input here (thank you) and some persuasive arguments to some of the changes in the room; I'm open to replacing the navy with some other color if anyone would like to make a suggestion!

I cant take it anymore. They painted over wood paneling, crown molding, etc. So my boyfriend chose to paint the bedroom, and i chose to paint our computer room. I don't have unlimited cash and they left us all the paints they used in the house. The rooms aren't very large and have cheap light brown/darkbrown carpets.

For room No 1. (The Bedroom) He isnt going for anything creative. The walls are currently...fecal matter brown (Not kidding, wouldnt be surprise if that was the name of the paint) and wishes to paint it red and the bottom part, the wood paneling, gun metal grey. I said that was fine as long as he please paints the crown molding white. That rooms fine.

Room No2. My computer room. It's currently painted a dark teal blue, its not ugly, but not what i'd like. I love blue. I decided to use the rest of his gunmetal grey to paint the wood paneling in this room too and the crown molding will also be white. I'm going to buy a new, brighter shade of blue but i really wanted to do something special with the design space. the plain part of the wall is about 4 feet high so its a nice space. The ceilings in the place are bare and white, not sure what more i can do with those.

My current thoughts on different designs consist of:

    Uneven Vertical stripes: colors: Gunmetal grey, white, the blue that's already there and a light blue.

    I saw one guy on reddit that made an awesome pixel square design, and since the space is smaller it probably wont take me near as long as it did him. It will require a lot of patience though and I could also use the color that is already there for this.

    I wouldn't mind if there was a way to cut frog tape into thin strange and make a bamboo looking wall using the color that's already there and using that as a seperater inbetween each 'bamboo shaft' the lighter shade of blue would be the contrasting color. (I've never seen this done before and have no idea where to really start)

The ultimate plans for this room is to have black framed posters ( generally 11x27 or 11x13) on the walls. The desks that are in there now are black/brown topped with silver legs (thus why i thought gunmetal grey might contrast okay with the legs of the desks) The chairs are black. There's currently white blinds but I was considering finding a light brown set, most likely bamboo or venetian to contrast with the light brown/dark brown carpet. Depending on the color scheme of top part of the painted walls, i'm on the fence about curtains. The lamps that are going in his room are a mixture of 2 cream/white cloth table lamps and 1 matching floor lamp.

Any ideas on improvements will help greatly, specially with painting. This is a room where a lot of time will be spent, since we're both in school. It's really the only comfortable place to do homework or play video games. The rooms are relatively tiny so a paint job that would make them feel bigger is choice. I wanted to use a multitude of colors because everything in this place is painted dark green, dark fecal brown or the dark blue. So Dark! Thanks for any insight given.

I may be able to upload pictures of the room later, grabbing lunch and finishing registration at the moment. ",,False,,t5_2ux9b,False,,,True,t3_1d37ql,http://www.reddit.com/r/DesignMyRoom/comments/1d37ql/painting_walls_ideas/,

I am ready to spend a few thousand euros for the transformation. I am also prepared to shop around on the 2nd hand market, although this makes it more difficult to match things.

The pictures are in this album (http://imgur.com/a/W27QQ#0). As you can see, these are quick pictures without taking any notice of the lightning. The large wall is currently in a bright green colour, while the other walls are in beige/white.

The furniture is not mine, the previous owner hower told me I could buy her couch for 500 €. But I am curious for your ideas. I start from almost scratch, so every basic idea is wecome.

1- The bed I'm weary of placing under those windows primarily because during my first winter here, a leak sprung from the ceiling after the weather warmed slightly.  This only happened once, but I'd rather be safe than wake up to dirty water dripping on me.

2- There's a heat vent on the interior wall behind/below the armoire.  The armoire is on legs so it doesn't block airflow into the room.

3- I'd kind of like to put a comfortable chair in there somewhere for reading.  But where?

4- I have no ceiling light and feel like that lamp is poorly placed.

5- I finally have decent framed art and such that I'll be putting up, most likely over my bed and replacing the item that's currently up.

It's covering a hole in the rug.  We were babysitting my brothers dog when he went away on his honeymoon and the dog got a thread and just kept pulling.  So it goes the whole way down the middle of the area rug, and since the carpet was literally less than 6 months old at the time, we couldn't replace the carpet.  Unfortunately under the rug is just plywood, otherwise I would have just ripped the carpet out.  

Also, the couch covers are necessary as I have three dogs who feel sitting on the floor is beneath them, lol.  I have never changed them to  because the couch is a wooden frame with just cushions, so those covers are actually duvet covers with the cushions inside the duvet.

(I own the house, so anything goes, provided it's not too expensive or labor intensive!)

[Here are some pictures of its current state](http://imgur.com/a/XTkg9#0).

The table and chairs have to stay. They're not my style, but I can't afford to buy a new set when I already have a fully functional one. Unless you can link me to some extremely cheap curtains big enough to cover ~100"", those will be staying as well. Everything else can go if need be.

My main issue is with the walls - textured baby poop. I've looked into ripping it down or smoothing it over, but it seems like an awful lot of money and materials would be required (college student budget). So my current thinking was this: put white wainscoting on the bottom 1/3 of the wall, hiding at least some of that nasty texture. It would be the [plain, cheap stuff from Home Depot](http://www.homedepot.com/buy/house-of-fara-8-linear-ft-mdf-overlapping-wainscot-paneling-kit-32mdfkit.html). I'd paint the crown molding white to match.

As for paint, I like the idea of some kind of dark blue, maybe with hints of grey? It's a north facing room with no ceiling lights (can't put any in, either), so I worry it might be too dark for the room. The kitchen has been recently painted ""smooth stone"", which is kinda grey-meets-beige. I would like to paint the living room at some point as well, and since there are no doors between any of the three rooms I'd like colors that can kind of flow into one another.

Oh, and since the dining room is also the entryway, I was considering putting a bench and a coat rack on the East wall, where there's currently two paintings and a storage unit. Or would that be inappropriate for a dining room?

The overall style I'm going for here is classic with some modern touches, with the focus on ""comfortable"". I want people to feel welcome when they come into my house.

We are having our first baby in December, and given that this room is near a very high-traffic area in the house, working without an effective partition between the office and kitchen -- which is likely to have a very noisy baby at any given time -- might be problematic.

The problem: The room needs to function as a dining room, a living room and an office for the two of us. We obviously need to double up some stuff. We're using one of our computers as a TV on an entertainment unit that will double as a desk.  So that solves one problem.

I'm redesigning my living room (I moved recently) and need your help. [Here are some pictures of the current space](http://imgur.com/a/CcayP).

This is a rental, so I can't paint the walls or change the shades. I also don't like the sliding mirror doors to the closet, but those have to stay as well. I like the carpet and would prefer not to change it. I'd also like to keep furniture replacement to a minimum, but if something just doesn't work, so be it. 

I plan to use the room to lounge, read, and watch movies. I have two college chairs that were a gift that I would like to incorporate somehow.  I would also like to incorporate a desk for my computer. My initial thought was to place it to the left of the couch, next to the heater, facing the windows, but I'm afraid that will divide the room to harshly. I also think the bookshelf below the tv is too high and plan to replace it with a lower, wider one and place the speakers on it. 

I have quite a bit of black&amp;white artwork that I plan to frame and hang, so I'm not too worried about the blank walls. 

Given the choice, I prefer to buy off Craigslist or used than buy new. I prefer functional to aesthetic. The style I like the most is mid century modern. 

What are your suggestions for splitting the space between the living and the studio? How can I make the room work well as both? Any other thoughts on color, more-fitting furniture, coffee-table ideas, etc. are welcome and appreciated.

A major problem is that I live in a northern european country (big up london town bruv) which most of the year has very grey lighting. In hot countries these pastel colours POP because of the brightness of the sky, in a grey shitting england do you think they'd just look a bit too cold?

I'm currently planning on painting my apartment, getting new furniture, putting up curtains, etc. 

[Here's the color scheme](http://i.imgur.com/ktJAPdQ.png) I've decided on for the living room. The walls will be painted light grey, with an orange accent wall [behind the couch](http://i.imgur.com/y2ctvfb.jpg) (not my actual apartment, just the demo apartment of the same layout on my complex's website). I won't actually be painting anything the magenta color; My plan was to find curtains in that color and then use orange and magenta throw pillows, room accessories, etc to tie it all together. 

However, no matter where I look, I just can't find magenta curtains. I've looked everywhere, and everything is either too pink, too purple, too short, or some weird fancy style that I just don't like. 

Here are a couple other angles of the living room if this helps: [One](http://i.imgur.com/ISyy3ZU.jpg) [Two](http://i.imgur.com/VaP5rmk.jpg)

**Guidelines:** 

* 96"" long. Can be longer; Willing to take them somewhere to get them shortened if absolutely necessary. 

* Would prefer sheers over thick curtains so that the living room will be brighter.

* Preferably a style similar to [these](http://www.bedbathandbeyond.com/product.asp?SKU=114830&amp;RN=129&amp;); I don't like anything overly fancy and I prefer curtains with grommets. These would be absolutely perfect if they had them in the right color. :(

* I'm mostly looking for a solid color, as opposed to something with a pattern on it. 

* [This](http://www.cb2.com/pillows/rugs-and-pillows/saudades-magenta-18x12-pillow/f8667) is one of the magenta throw pillows I'll be getting, so I'd like curtains that match that.

* Must be able to be purchased online and shipped to the US (preferably without crazy cross country shipping costs).

**Option Two:** 

I'm also willing to take suggestions on a different color that would go well with the orange. I've tried out a few combinations and I just can't seem to find anything that doesn't clash with the orange. I never thought I'd be painting an accent wall orange, but I've really gotten attached to the idea and would like to find a color that contrasts it well without clashing with it. Yellow is definitely out.

Over the last year I've picked up a couple of posters from visiting NASA centers that I'm finally getting around to framing and hanging up, but apparently none of them are standard frame sizes. They were also all wrapped when I bought them, so while I expected them to be printed like normal posters they're actually printed on paper.

Does anyone have any good ideas of how I could hang these up and still make them look good? Obviously I could have them laminated and just pin them to the wall, but that doesn't look very good.

Relevant information and width X height dimensions(I'd like to think I properly measured): 

* The three posters are going in my office/study room and there's plenty of wall space.
* All 3 are simple, white paper-black line posters that resemble schematics
* Poster 1- Apollo mission diagram: 39.5""x12""

First off, I should've scoped Reddit out to find this subreddit before moving into my apartment. It's awesome! Now that I'm here and my mistake has already been made, here's the issue.

I have this desk from Target that fits against one of my bedroom walls pretty well. I like that my monitors are visible from across my bed, so I can lie down and watch something...meaning the desk is on the ideal wall. However, there's a large chunk of wall on my right side that I feel could be used for something more useful, but the desk is a little too wide for something like another desk or flat surface to fit there (which would actually be pretty useful to me). I would like to find something to occupy the corner between my desk and my wall and/or find a surface to fill some of that space on my right.

Though it appears to be an option, I cannot reduce the desk width by moving the PC underneath the desk—I don't want to trap that kind of heat and make the computer work harder to cool itself (I also don't want to kick it).

Any suggestions? Thanks!

http://i.imgur.com/mpUN5l5.jpg

Beige cabinets are going to be painted white. The wall behind the sink is going to be painted either teal or a butter yellow, I think, unless you guys have better suggestions.

I have a small vintage kitchenware collection that I want to display on shelves above the sink. Lots of vivid solid-color Pyrex and Fire King, some Occupied Japan items, enamelware.

Challenges:   
a) due to lack of space, need to continue storing pots and pans on the wall (BUT will be replacing them soon, so I have color options);  

b) that cupboard on the right still needs to open, at least halfway. So I'm afraid of shelving going over that far;

c) coffeemaker/toaster/kettle have nowhere else to go, but I want to replace those as well. 

All that considered, this is the best idea I've had so far:

Anyway, [this] (http://imgur.com/a/qa2M0) has always been my room. Of course, it looked bigger when I was younger because I was smaller and because I didn't have nearly all the stuff I do now. It used to be pink, but the owners painted it white with the green ( I hate green, and the whole house is this color). I am saving up to get a proper bedroom set, preferably a Queen size, if I can fit it in here. I will also be investing in curtains for the window and closet. So please, design my room! The dresser in the corner can be put in the closet since I have some room in there. 

I would like an entertainment center in here sometime in the future too since I have my cable box, xbox 360, and PS3 hooked up to my tv. I will also be getting a PS4 soon and would like to take my Wii out of it's storage box. Basically, how can I rearrange it to make it look less cluttered on one side?

Currently, the bathroom includes a toilet and a simple shower stall (no sink/vanity).  The shower must have been added later, because it backs up into the Bilco door entrance, which is problematic when bringing in furniture and other large objects.  

Does anyone have suggestions on how to reorient the space? We want to give ourselves a few more inches in the Bilco hallway behind the shower, and to add a sink.  As this is in the basement, moving drainage lines is difficult, but one thought is to use a toilet with a  macerating pump and to move the shower in towards the current toilet (the drain would then be on the edge of the shower floor instead of dead center).

**Color**  
So far for the colors of my room, I am thinking of painting it a warm gray or beige. However, I'm not sure if these colors will match my current baseboards, moulding, covers and flooring. If they don't match, what color can I use? I also can change the baseboards, mouldings and  covers, although that would not be preferred.  


**Style**  
I did the 'choose your style' thing and it appears that the modern style would really suit me. I agree too, and would like my design to sleek and clean (possibly minimal?). With that being said, I am wondering if my current baseboards, mouldings and covers can pull off a modern look.  


**Furniture**  
i would like to have at a minimum a bed and desk in my room. I am not sure about having a night stand or additional lamps, but if it can complete a modern look I will definitely implement it. I also will have to have a chair for my desk. I am wondering what kind of chair I should get with my desk (rolling or 4 legs?). I am also wondering if I should have a rug in my room.  


**Window**  
Currently at my window are blinds that are kind of tattered up. I am wondering if I should replace them with new blinds, or to go with blackout curtains.


**Lighting**  
As you can see, the current lighting fixture in my room would probably not fit into any design. So I am wondering what kind of lighting fixture I can get. Should I get something that will make the room super bright, or something that makes the room dim at night?  


**Wall**  
I would like to hang up some of my awards that I have received over the years. I was wondering how I would go about doing so. I was thinking about using shadow boxes and arranging on the wall behind my future desk. Is this a good idea or should I do something else?

One of my thoughts was [this awesome paint drawing I made](http://i.imgur.com/JtmuVTe.png?1) Obviously not to scale. The TV would be mounted on the wall to the right of the bookcase.

Another thought I had was taking out the top shelves of the bookcase and putting the tv there then getting a sectional/rap-around couch in there, but that would take away from the fire place. Which the TV is currently covering up. Note for the tv, it definitely isnt staying where it is because it's blocking the fireplace, but since it is summer here I don't need it for now. 

Any input would be greatly appreciated! Thanks for the help!!

Edit: I should also mention my girlfriend thinks white furniture would be good in there, but I plan on getting a dog in the near future and have heard white and shedding dogs don't go very well together!",,False,,t5_2ux9b,1370627760.0,,,True,t3_1fviyg,http://www.reddit.com/r/DesignMyRoom/comments/1fviyg/need_decorating_and_furnishing_ideas_for_my/,

I stumbled upon /r/DesignMyRoom looking for a good place to post a fun project I will be tackling very soon. My girlfriend and I bought a house last September, and have been upgrading every aspect of it. It is a 2100 sq ft, single story house in Gilbert, AZ. It is a 3 bedroom, split floor plan that came with a very awesome additional room. The builder gave the original homeowner a flex room option, where he/she could either choose a 3rd garage port or a bonus room. Luckily for us they chose the bonus room!  
The bonus room connects directly to the kitchen as such:

(the small ""room"" by the door is a closet. sorry, not very good with the web cad software)  
.  
We want this room to become a *man cave*. I want to have 3 TVs on the wall to watch multiple football games at once (already built a rack server elsewhere in the house with 4x4 hdmi matrix switch over HDBaseT to handle the connections). I want to have a shuffleboard table. I'm thinking of installing a wet bar where the closet currently is, considering the water line for my fridge is in that part of the wall.  
The floor is currently carpet, but I'm open to dark tile or dark laminate.   
Other than that, I have no other ideas for this room.   
.  
I thought it might be fun to see what others would do with the space!  It's a tough room to fill, given its dimensions.  
I will be checking back with you guys when we get started on this room to go over our final plan, and then post some awesome before/after shots!

I'm moving into the upstairs room in my apartment in a few weeks when that roomate moves, and I'll have far more room than I have stuff for right now.

The attached picture is the current layout of what he has in there (very sparse Buddhist guy).  Hardwood floors, and the roof slopes down to the West.  It's a good 5' at the lowest point.

The stairs are on the North wall.  70' out of the West window is the interstate (not too noisy though), hidden behind some trees.  The window to the South leads to a major road and has a small balcony outside, but no actual door to it.

I'm thinking of building a 6'x2' desk out of birch and black iron water pipe, the only place bright enough is where the current desk/bookshelves are.  Maybe a raised daybed sort of thing for a reading nook by the West window.  Bed aligned probably on the South wall.

I can build what I need if I need it, the rest will be used stuff found locally.

I'm really not sure what to do w/ the rest of the space though.  I may buy his exercise equipment if the price is fair, or I may move my treadmill up there, but I still want a more livable space that will help prevent me from just sitting in front of my computer all damn day every day.

I have these gaudy/dorky dragon lamps that I want to hang in my new condo. Since they seem like a big commitment - As in, it won't be easy to move them around and patch the hole up - I want to be sure my placement is good.  

Does anyone have an opinion? (Yes I know the lamps are a bit odd but I'm mostly looking for placement opinions not just ""don't put them up they're weird.."" So I appreciate any thoughts! Here are some photos.  

I have 4 lamps. I want to put 2 above the couch with a tapestry between them. Here is how our couch is set up.  

http://i.imgur.com/rHSdgUq.jpg  

The lamps and tapestry would be centered above the couch - not on the wall. Does this seem visually appealing? I feel like the right side of my wall near the door will seem empty and off center.  

The other two I am stuck on bc my idea doesn't seem to want to work:  

Here is a panorama from one side of the room  
http://i.imgur.com/lGAFGQd.jpg  

B is the same lamp above the right side of the couch, you can see in the first photo. C is where I wanted to put another lamp, but now I don't know where to put it bc of the below issue. D is on a small wall between my kitchen entry and the living room area, where I wanted a lamp.  

http://i.imgur.com/mztXkgU.jpg  

Here is a closer photo of the two lamps C &amp; D from the panorama. D seems ok, but here is the issue with C:  

http://i.imgur.com/JSw3id7.jpg  

We have a tight fit bc of our couch to enter our place and living room. And the lamps have a shorter cord than I thought. Excuse my BF in his PJs- I made him get up from a nap. He is 6ft. So as you can see, the lamp is low and in the entry way. We cannot push our couch back to make the entry larger. Do you think that is horrible placement for a low hanging lamp?  

I really wanted all 4 lamps in our living/dining room area, but I can't figure out the best place to put C that I wanted on that wall with the book shelf.  

Here are a couple ideas:  
Hallway: http://i.imgur.com/Wj18dox.jpg (this is the dark hallway in the panorama photo, the dark area to the right of the brown double door closet)  

Flanking the kitchen entry http://i.imgur.com/3Fv1H5N.jpg  But we already have a big chandelier lighting that area. And I don't like the kitchen so it seems weird having lamps flank my crappy kitchen.  

Last, my ideal C position could maybe work if we used an extension cord to raise the lamp but I don't know how to make that look nice and hide the 2 cords, I worry it will look really bad with an extension cord (since it already looks crappy with the regular cord). But it is high ceilings so maybe raising the lamps to above my BF's head (he is 6ft) would be best?  

Please please i would love any opinions! Even if its just to say my place sucks haha. (of course excuse the mess, we are still organizing after moving in)

I want to keep it light in colour and am thinking of a light grey colour for the cabinet, though not sure which tone. I am also unsure if I want to do light coloured cabinets on top and dark ones on the bottom, and if I will go with a light or dark counter top.

I guess a style we are going for is..contemporary i would say. Something along those lines/modern.

We were thinking a neutral, light tan would be the only way to go for the foyer and base color as it also flows into upstairs halls, but are open to any input.

We also really love emerald, so if we could incorporate emerald into the kitchen one way or the other that would be awesome.

I finally got around to cleaning my room out after years of mess and hoarding, so I've now got close to a blank canvas to work with.

[album!](http://imgur.com/a/ZLFs4)

Ignore the vacuum, the sheets and everything else, as I took these photos just as I finished up cleaning! The small dresser by the door is also not there anymore.

I'm limited in the way that I can't change the carpet, which is a shame. Yet, I'm willing to try and incorporate the colour into some sort of colour scheme.

I've been thinking of either:

-White, Stone &amp; Black/Charcoal

-White, Stone &amp; Navy/Some shades of blue and maybe grey

OR

-White, Stone &amp; Coffee/A shade of brown

I'm willing to either paint the furniture (desk and shelves) another colour or to possibly consider buying different furniture altogether. I was thinking of possibly painting them a stone colour or possibly a beige colour (I'm really open to advice on colours tbh). It's also possible for me to paint the walls, but I thought the white would work well with any design I went with (let me know).

I'm buying new sheets, pillows and everything for the bed tomorrow so I would love some advice on the colours for those as well!

I'm also planning on decorating the walls with some kind of art. I was considering creating a few black and white posters with the rasterbator (found online) or to perhaps purchase some kind of canvas art. Honestly, I have no idea and would love some advice here!

Basically, I wanted to ask everyone's opinions on the colours, what might work and don't be afraid to tear my plan apart!

We are the first people to use this space in probably 15 years... 

I have a decent idea of what I want to do (maybe) but there is so much awesome here I thought I might check in here. 

I am wanting a cool and comfy space for about 4 or 5 nerds. There will be a larger open area and two small offices. (see floorplan). 

The building has some cool features. Exposed brick (needs cleaning, no prob) and some old cast-iron fireplaces (just for decoration, I guess) 

*Floorplan: http://imgur.com/1p19V
*Pictures: http://timfixit.imgur.com/ 

The doors to the office area are not there yet. You can see in one of the office photos there are some 2x4s in a plaster wall.. those will come out. I am thinking that wall will have two glass doors with dark aluminum frame (and windows to the rest of the office). Doors kinda like [this]. (http://www.northliteglass.com/media/images_upload/product/commercialresized.jpg?rand=898931614) 
with maybe a tall thin vertical window next to it. 


The office on the right won't have any windows. Since the ceilings are tall (12.5f') I was going to put about 4-5 1x1 windows in the wall between the two offices. This way the ""inside"" office will get some light from the windows in the neighboring office, and from the front part of the office as well. 

Since the non-brick walls are plater, and in roughish shape, I was thinking I could do some kind of texture on the wall but nothing too over the top. Maybe silver and white? 

I was thinking this for the [hard wood floors](http://www.houzz.com/photos/125447/Montaigne-Collection-Charleroi-Wood-Floors-eclectic-wood-flooring-other-metro) . 

For the two radiators -- paint them black. For the window trim and trim around the doors -- maybe white? 

I am going to drywall the ceiling and put in some recessed lights and track lighting. Probably two long strips per area running north to south in the floor plan image (?). 

There is an old archway to other offices (its been walled over on both sides) you can see in one of the photos. There is some old duct work that is not being used that goes through the wall where the archway is.

As this is the oldest part of the building the floor is also about 6 inches lower than the rest of the building when you come through the door. So I will probably build a little wood platform to step down on to (just one step) when you step through the door.

This office space won't be for clients or anything.. it is going to be a super comfy collaboration space with whiteboards and probably bean bag chairs and some desks. 

I have some old steelcase desks that will probably work well in here, but not averse to something else. 

The brick I intend to clean with a wire brush and then sponge it down and seal it with some type of low lustre compound to help keep the dust down. 

I will be happy to post ""after"" photos when I finish. In several months. 

What do you guys think? Houzz.com has been a good source of inspiration but I wish it was easier to find comparable commercial spaces on there :)

We are moving into our new house and the decor is not my taste, as is to be expected. Here is an [album of pics](http://imgur.com/a/84Qz1) from the realtor. FYI, none of the furniture or anything is mine. As you can see, yellow is the dominant color throughout the house. Yellow paint and light for some reason makes me feel really bad, so it's gotta be changed. I am not an earth tone person and I have ZERO fear of intense color and very much prefer it. I was planning on making any neutrals a light gray. 

Eventually, I will be able to make up my mind on how I want most of the rooms painted, except the room with the stone fireplace that I am planning to make a library. The stone pretty much dictates what I can paint the rest of the wall so I'm feeling really restricted. That goes for the foyer where the stone continues on the opposite side of the fireplace. There is a long, tall wall that extends from the library, through the foyer, and up the stairs that I am planning on making light gray. 

So you can see what I am going for for other areas of the house, I have some extremely primitive (hilarious) mock ups of how I might do

I sort of know what I want, but I'm not sure the best way to achieve that.

This room is used for watching tv, playing video games, having friends over, and the general lounge room. We have a formal living room too, but my girlfriend is in charge of designing that.

Here is an album of pictures of the game room:
http://imgur.com/a/y5Tin#0

The first few pictures are mine, if you want some more let me know and I'll take them. The second set are from the previous owners. The last one is a bonus puppy picture for helping me, haha.

All of the furniture that you see is from my old apartment and I would like to replace it with nicer things.

1. The Couch. I'm thinking about going with a sectional like the previous owners had. Any objections? Color suggestion?

2. Entertainment Stand. The one pictured is from IKEA and I'd like to get something that doesn't scream apartment/dorm room. The speakers are staying though, they're new.

3. In the original owner's pictures you can see a bar in the one corner, I would love to get a bar for that same spot. Any ideas?

4. I loathe the fabric on the bench area. Any suggestions there? There is storage underneath.

5. Other furniture. Should I go for end tables and a coffee table or just one type? It's not pictured very well, but there's an end table in the far corner next to the couch.

6. Artwork. I'm pretty lost here, I don't know what to go with. I love sports, but I don't want a typical 'sporty man cave' -- that's too tacky IMO. That one picture is a press that the newspaper used to print newspapers and was given to me by my great grandfather, so it's special. 

One idea I did have was to get prints like these, they're sports related, but a little more 'mature' looking:
http://cityprintsmapart.com/ballparks/pnc-park/

I'm a big fan of music too and the other idea I had was to get concert prints, stuff you find on this site: http://www.gigposters.com. The only reason I'm not too keen on that idea is that I'd like to decorate my office like that instead.

Etc... That door on the wall to the left of the TV just leads to storage. The first picture was taken from the doorway that leads to the rest of the basement. The lights have dimmers.

The house is very old, so the walls are very thin, I would like to change that, so less cold/heat and noise gets in and out. I'm not sure if that would be usefull as there are a lot of windows (the largest wall is almost only windows).

A fireplace in general is very nice but this one...I don't like it that much. Would it be (easily) possible to remove/replace it?

Also I don't know where to place the TV. The jalousie is almost always closed on the windows with the TV in front of it. If the Fireplace weren't there I would have placed the TV to that wall, but then the problem would be that the couch would be in the way of the door to the garden.

I'm quite a movie fan and have a 7.1 surround system, the problem is there are cables everywhere, those need to be hidden but still replacable.

The deets:

NYC prewar apartment. Room that we're concerned about - the foyer, specifically the wall color.

* We're renovating a unit in the same line that we live, so these are pics of our apartment, even though the unit is a gut reno (and there are some details different, like the pony walls were removed in ours, but we're keeping them in the new place)

* See floor plan (pic in album below) The room is right off the front door, and from the front door you can see through the foyer to the living/dining room with a large window. The living room is light yellow

* Architectural details: There are (what I've recently learned is called) pony walls and an archway leading into the living/dining room. There is also picture rail high up on the walls.

* Rug: There is a red/white/blue (but not patriotic-like) Persian rug which we're keeping in the space

* Furniture: We will be using (what my mother calls) a schrank, which is a large, wooden linen cabinet (see pic), and a wooden side-by-side.

* Lighting: We will be using an antique brass and painted glass chandelier.

[PICTURES OF ABOVE THINGS...](http://imgur.com/a/dcV5N)

I would like to go bold, possibly with red or blue picked up from the rug, but I'm open to anything. Thinking an azure blue like [this](http://www.houzz.com/photos/29273/Carson-Poetzl--Inc--mediterranean-living-room-phoenix), or a grey-blue like [this](http://www.houzz.com/photos/2345608/Residential-Projects-traditional-living-room-london), or even a red like [this](http://www.houzz.com/photos/71177/Warm-and-Eclectic-Living-Room-eclectic-living-room-boise).

Other things to keep in mind: The living/dining room also has a lot of wood and a very large oriental rug which also has blues, but is mostly red like the one above. The kitchen, which is right off the entrance door is going to be very industrial/modern look with one bright orange wall (which is throwing me off a bit with using a red in the foyer, but hey, I'm no expert.)

I've been living here for a while now and decided it's high time I make this place look like I live here. I'm going to be redesigning the whole place, but starting with my living room. I like a more modern, high tech look.

From the pictures, the bose speakers and desk will be gone for sure. I'm building the big speakers so I would like to stick with those and have another polk audio center channel not pictured. I'm thinking of putting the subwoofer behind the couch, and potentially getting a new couch(es) or at least reupholstering this one as I'm not a fan of the design. I will be getting [this used tv](http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=2743741) or a new 55"" lcd tv. I'm going to build a custom media center, thinking of a nice black finish, but not sure if it should be long enough for just the tv and speakers on the floor, hold the speakers and tv, or go the whole length of the wall. I'm also an avid diver so I want to put some photos from my dives on the wall next to the door. I have the 3 11x14 frames in the photo or I can get new ones.


looking for advice on:

* media center design
* lighting
* pictures
* area rug
* wall color
* couch upholstery/new couch(es)
* anything that will make the room look better

I also like comics, and I would like to have a book case somewhere in the room to hold all of my trade paper backs. I also have tons of comic related prints (11x17) that I could hang up.

Finally I like movies and music, so setting up a home theater is also something to think about.

Anything goes for this room and nothing is set in stone. I am interested in hearing anything from color schemes to layout.

I do not want the room to be anything cheesy or over the top. I would like it to have a nice clean look.

I've recently moved into a house and so far have thrown my stuff into the basement for lack of anywhere else to store it. Now I'm looking to turn the space into a studio for myself to work in.

Pictures: http://imgur.com/a/JMVft
Rough blue-print: http://i.imgur.com/0OcWsIth.jpg

The main purpose of this room is for me to sit on a desk and write fiction or code. I also play a bit of music and would like room to setup a synth/guitar/bass stands and a small laptop to serve as a music recording station. Lastly, I obviously have a ton of books I'd like to display in an aesthetically pleasing way.

Nice to haves:

- I'd love to have a small workspace on a wall (white board or white-board paint) somewhere within easy access as I tend to take extensive notes and draw diagrams quite a bit to help my work-flow.
- Some kind of rug layout would be especially nice as the tiles get a bit cold and I like the feeling of fiber under my bare feet
- 3 distinct ""areas"" - one for the desk/computer/work and the ""whiteboard"", one for music and one for books/relaxing. I'll probably want to move a comfy reading chair down here as well and maybe a couple of beanbags for company
- I'd love to get rid of the wall sconces and come up with a more attractive and less stark lighting pattern
- I'd love to paint the walls or maybe even just do one accent wall, but not sure what colors to go with
- Can't do much about the pillars or the doors or the tiles, but almost anything else I'd be willing to at least try to mod

I'm moving to a new place and have zero furniture.  I'm excited to design the space and would LOVE some help :)  

**Quirks of the space**:
The closet doors open outwards, and are floor to ceiling making it a difficult wall (perhaps a roman shade or no door closet with great organization can fix this?)

The window in the living/bedroom is all encompassing on a diagonal wall.


**Use of the space**: Sleeping, working from home via the computer, having small groups of friends over - very occasionally. 


**Concerns**: I'm not sure if having a bed in the space makes sense in order to get a nice workspace/lounge area out of it.  Is a full loft-bed more feasible? If so - what wall do I put it on? 


**Aesthetic**: I like clean and white with pops of colour.  I like the more industrial look that has come into style.  I like stripes, 'natural' looking things, and clean lines. I love statement wallpaper or statement art pieces on a wall.

I recently moved into this bedroom in a shared apartment while I go to school. I would love to hear design / decoration ideas, because I’m stuck.


**Here is some general information**

* I would be using this room to sleep, study and goof off on my free time. I would also have my boyfriend staying over on the weekends.
* Room dimensions are 13’3” x 11’1”.
* Here are some weird/skewed panoramic photos [photo 1](http://i.imgur.com/pAmrdaD.jpg) and [photo 2](http://i.imgur.com/Q8GdXbx.jpg)
* My room has weird [maroon floor tiles](http://i.imgur.com/7FmiGHl.jpg)
* I’m keeping the dressers and the night stand but I’m getting getting a Queen bed soon.
* Overall I would like to achieve a soft romantic look for this bedroom :)

**And these are the things I would love suggestions on:**

1. What wall color walls could possibly match my maroon floor tiles? Here are a few color samples I picked up. I want a lighter color. Feel free to suggest colors that are not here! [sample 1](http://i.imgur.com/1QC9HQp.jpg), [sample 2](http://i.imgur.com/KMrLUXe.jpg), [sample 3](http://i.imgur.com/Mujuh89.jpg), [sample 4](http://i.imgur.com/YFV34UR.jpg), [sample 5](http://i.imgur.com/g4d3qhW.jpg)

2. For my new bed, I’m thinking a frame and a headboard the same color as the 6-drawer dresser. If everything stays the same it should look like this with the queen bed in: [Floorplan with new bed in](http://i.imgur.com/qgyZme4.png). 
Any suggestions for bedding? 

3. I want a big rug to add coziness but I can't think of a rug color that would match my floor tile color. Suggestions?

4. I like my dresser in general but it has this weird cork board panel that I really don’t like. [See?](http://i.imgur.com/sFchZSi.jpg) How can I make it look better? I was thinking of getting a picture the size of the panel and sticking it there. 

5. I really need to bring in some sort of desk to study on. I don’t need a lot of space just a surface to put my laptop on and preferably with some space to store books in. I have no idea where I would place a desk though. I was thinking maybe if it’s high enough I could put it against the air conditioning thing on the window wall since I never really use the AC and probably never will.

6. I really want to get an Audrey Hepburn picture enlarged and framed to hang on one of my walls. Still unsure of what picture to use, what kind of frame to get and what wall to hang it on. I love [this picture though](http://classnfab.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/audrey_hepburn_poster012.jpg)

7. Any other decorating ideas that you think would follow a romantic theme would be greatly appreciated!

EDIT:
 what do you guys think about [this color scheme?](http://i.imgur.com/S9hUXGu.png)

Needs help with paint and design.,3,3,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/DesignMyRoom/comments/1h5qbv/34_year_old_guy_in_a_younger_mans_body_buys_first/,"I just bought this loft and I dig it, but it's very ""clean"". White walls, hardwood floors. I want a place that reflects who I am, and was really trying to purchase an Industrial place because I love that brick/concrete look, especially when it is mixed with some wood. Unfortunately, all the lofts I could find were either out of the way or too expensive, so my new place was a good compromise. 

I train Capoeira, I do gymnastics, and I love to read. I don't like to watch TV and don't plan on having one in my house. So I want to go beyond white walls, especially since I do a lot of hand stands and other stuff against the wall and they'll be getting dirty, lol.

**In addition to the living room area I also need to have:**

* a workout area with a punching bag and rings

* some open floor space to move around (for dance/capoeira)

* my home office (I work from home and want a pretty decent sized desk)

* a dining table that can be converted to a poker table

Here's a link to photos of my place:
http://imgur.com/a/GZv35

and here's a link to an album of rooms with designs I like:
http://imgur.com/a/CNZPF

I'm not sure how I want to arrange everything but right now I'm thinking of trying to keep the workout stuff in my bedroom. This would including painting a wall with chalkboard paint to keep workout data on there and other notes. I'm considering where to put the office: in the living room area or in the alcove next to the kitchen? Or should I put the poker table in the alcove?

I would love to do something cool in the hallway. Wood would be awesome, but probably not practical. Maybe wallpaper? Or should I just paint it to match the living room?

My plan is to come up with a two-tone paint palette for the living room (currently thinking something green and gray) and a separate two-tone for the bedroom (maybe something blue and gray).

I think the kitchen looks good as long as the kitchen cabinets are an actual timber veneer and not melamine made to look like it. If so the easiest change to make to the kitchen down the track is to the cupboard fronts rather than the benchtop. They will all be standard size so an easy thing to swap out. There are loads of modular kitchen companies around who do parts of a kitchen and not the whole thing and they can provide good advice on colour/finish etc. For the lounge and bedroom I suggest you look at some on pinterest (you dont need to be registered to use it) and collect all your favourites together - that will give you a good idea of what aesthetic direction you want to head in - eg: colour, materials, lighting and you can then you can start building a specific picture of what you want. I suggest neutrals with some colour brought in using a rug or artwork and some good air cleansing potplants. If you do have Ikea nearby then you could always just go and pick a look you like and build it out of their catalogue. Good luck!

Moving into my first apartment the second week of July. (Stoked) And need some help laying out the living room. What I current already have is the [entertainment center with 2 tower speakers](http://i.imgur.com/OK2GT9v.jpg). I plan on getting a couch, chair, coffee table and an end table for this room. Here is the [floor plan](http://i.imgur.com/FuwtxWK.gif) (It will be flipped in mine with the living room on the right side as you enter). And here is the [Planner5D](https://planner5d.com/view/?key=a7a2e807bbfea459c726cf83b8c45fec) with the layout I currently have in mind as well as using actual diminsions (I erred on the side of caution with my measurements and made the walls an inch or two shorter) between doors etc. This plan is using diminsions from the furniture I have my eye on, and which follow a basic size. &lt;edit to add&gt; The chair is oddly faced, but the fact that behind it opens to a hallway and dining room really opens up possibility to turn it and not be an issue.

How does this look?

Side note: I have [these items](http://imgur.com/a/XxvCq) professional framed.

Hey guys, so right after finals, for some reason I started getting into this whole home makeover thing for my room. I feel like I've done all I can think of and now im looking for outside help from people who know more about this stuff.
* http://imgur.com/a/WNgVU#s1FO02d
* The first 4 are from before; the rest is current.
* Dropped about $250 total so far.
Some background info you might need to take into consideration:
* I'm 21(m) and in college.
* I live in Hawaii, where moving out is not an option until 25-30 so I am living with my parents.
* Any insight on what college girls might like that will set me apart from other guys.
* I have already invested into my bed (memory foam, 400+ thread count etc).
* try to keep everything below ~$500 lol

Here's a few questions I have: 

1: So I guess I'm allowed to hang things on my wall for now (the wall is stucco) so any opinions? obviously I cannot afford really expensive art.  I was thinking about grabbing this http://25.media.tumblr.com/971a4faae6a28dbe1384c0b3eafc7509/tumblr_miw449hRcy1qbs6i5o1_1280.jpg or if that is too much than maybe http://wallpoper.com/images/00/23/85/54/abstract-deviantart_00238554.jpg ? since a huge picture frame would be extremely expensive, i was thinking about buying 3 smaller ones and cutting the photo up into each one and putting them side by side so i'd look like this http://i.istockimg.com/file_thumbview_approve/10600329/2/stock-illustration-10600329-background-with-multiple-tv-sets-and-radar.jpg''
