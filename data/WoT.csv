1362500146.0,152,self.WoT,19pnn2,I have a theory about Slayer and Padan Fain (Amol Spoilers),168,16,46,http://www.reddit.com/r/WoT/comments/19pnn2/i_have_a_theory_about_slayer_and_padan_fain_amol/,"Dont read this if you haven't read the last book!

Ok I have been thinking almost non stop about this awesome series since I finished AMOL. One aspect that I loved was the duality, every fan will know what I mean. I very recently came to the conclusion that Moridin was in fact the anti-dragon, the equal and opposite to Rand, reborn as endlessly as Rand is, to face him again and again. I felt so dumb for not realising this before AMOL.

Anyway here's my new theory. In the early books Moiraine or someone comments on how unusual it was for there to be three Taveren. Mat and Perrin are kind of wild cards, unknown entities that the pattern had placed there for a reason to be seen in time. So for there to be a duality, in my mind there needed to be two other 'wild cards' for the shadow.

So what makes Fain and Slayer 'wild cards'? Well Fain is an anomaly even to the Dark One, a powerfully 'evil' character that has no allegiance to the Dark one or anyone at all. completely unique in his powers, almost unstoppable.

Slayer to me was also an anomaly. A non source user with natural ability inside a forgotten world of dreams, a man with a sort of split personality psychosis who serves the Shadow for no greater pleasure than to hunt and kill.

The pattern, or the Creator maybe, had Mat and Perrin become the opposite of their rival 'wild card'. I'll explain: to me The creator represents good and the DO represents evil, but what did Padan Fain represent? He may have performed evil acts, but his first person narratives made him seem more like he was insane, madness incarnate. Unpredictable. In short I think he represented chaos, outside of simple evil motivations like greed or power. So chaos, or random destruction is a hard concept to have an opposite to, some might say 'order' but I think it could be random Luck, things going right for no discernible reason. Mat is arguably luck made flesh. 

I remember thinking it was anticlimactic the way Mat killed Fain, especially when they really didnt have much to do with each other for most of the series, it didnt feel like a conclusion of anything. But really, it was LUCKY that mat killed him or fain may have killed Rand. Mat and Fain were actually both linked by the Dagger in a very deep way.

So Perrin is a different story. For his duality with slayer I would simply suggest looking at it as hunter and prey. The slayer of wolves hunting the ultimate prey, Young Bull. With the conclusion of the old cliche ""the hunter has become the prey"" Perrin turns the table on Slayer in a big way. Look at the other similarities: Perrin is torn between two worlds, the Wolf and the human, struggling to remain human, fighting to both protect his friends and loved ones but also fighting to protect the wolves. It's like he's two people. Slayer is psychotically stuck in two worlds as 'Lord Luc' and Slayer, preferring to be Slayer, not really wanting to be Luc (that's how I took his section of AMOL anyway).

Anyway, that's my theory. Any thoughts?",,False,self,t5_2rdg1,False,,,True,t3_19pnn2,http://www.reddit.com/r/WoT/comments/19pnn2/i_have_a_theory_about_slayer_and_padan_fain_amol/,

We ask that anyone who has received one of these early copies burn it while laughing maniacally.  If this proves impossible (there are multitudes of reasons it may be) we humbly ask that you speak nothing of what is contained AMOL. And by speak I mean type.

Please recuse yourself from any discussion where important (unresolved) details are subject. Even hints that you are not aware you are giving can spoil the fun. For example, if you hint in a theory discussion, technically using only facts from previous books, you can still ruin the magnitude of the shock that the author may have been aiming for.

NO SPOILERS IN YOUR TITLES, AND TAG YOUR POSTS!",147,42,56,http://www.reddit.com/r/WoT/comments/178nyw/come_on_wot_no_spoilers_in_your_titles_and_tag/,"Look, I'm a fast reader, and I got the book Tuesday 1/8. I finished Wednesday night 1/9. I then went to a signing on 1/12 and wanted so badly to talk about AMoL with other fans, but I couldn't. Only one person I talked to had also finished it and neither of us wanted to ruin it for others.

Now I come back here to see where the discussion is going, and I'm pissed. Not for myself but for anyone who hasn't finished it. People are posting and while frequently they are using the Spoiler tag, often there's something in the title of that post that is itself a spoiler. I don't see what good it is to post Thoughts on (Something from the last few chapters indicating the survival or death of a major character) [Spoilers]. You've just told everyone that this person has loose ends to tie up, or if asking about their legacy, that they're most likely dead!

I understand that some people will take a while in finishing the book. People have to work, if they have kids they may only be able to read a few pages a night. If they could afford to drop thirty bucks this week. I'm glad a lot of us finished it and enjoyed it. But I would straight up want to murder somebody who had ruined it for me after I put fifteen years of my life into it.

I recommend that if you're doing an AMoL post with spoilers, you title it Question About X-character or event, Spoilers, or Discussion About X-character or event, Spoilers. Then think about what you put in the title. If it suggests the outcome of a character or event, don't put that. Reword it. And mods, I'm sure you're up against it and I commend you for your work, but I saw a post on the front page of this sub, getting upvoted and commented on, that gives away the whole damn *series*. I just saw somebody post that they started Eye of the World because of all of us and the discussion. Please keep on top of it. Let's all be good citizens. Don't take away the anticipation and surprise you felt from others. Keep your post titles simple and spoiler-free, and when in doubt, err on the side of caution.

RJ: Um, when I was much younger, before I met Harriet, I had two girlfriends simultaneously, who arranged my dating schedule between them, who was going to date me on which night. They chipped in together to buy me birthday presents Christmas presents. You know, they just sort of shared me between them, you know. And they had been friends before, and I am not quite sure whether or not they made the decision they were both going to date me or not, on their own, before they first met me, it just came about. But I figured if I could manage two, surely Rand could manage three. Besides there are mythological reasons to have these three women involved with him. As far as my view on this, with Harriet, I have many more than three women, there are so many facets to her personality she quite often makes me dizzy, I am quite satisfied there. About how she feels about this, I suspect you want her answer, I seem to remember her saying to me, you do remember this is fantasy right? And I think it was an accident she was holding a carving knife to me throat, just coincidence, but I am not sure.


Harriet: In four short words, I am not for it. Four and a half words.

I highly recommend rereading the portion.

Basically, though,  Sammael says to Graendal

**“You deliver a message to Demandred from me. Tell him I know what he is up to.” Events to the south had Demandred’s mark all over them. Demandred had always liked using proxies.**

How does Graendal respond?

By talking about the Shara and how it controls its channelers. All the while watching how he might react.

So, in hindsight, it seems pretty clear to me that Graendal knows what Demandred is doing and is deliberately bating Sammael to see if he knows as well.

There is also a nice bit earlier where Mesaana is playing a game with some ivory dominoes (building a tower with them), while waiting for other Forsaken to show up at a meeting.    It's a nice visual foreshadowing about where Mesaana it actually infiltrated. (The White Tower)

After the Last Battle, Mat went back to the Seanchan and everyone there looks at him with awe and mentions his name in hushed tones. However, when he meets Tuon, She says that since she is with child, she can kill him now and Mat laughed.

This last meeting between the two got a lot of people riled upon saying that Tuon is a horrible person and such.  But I just realized that Tuon has now publicly acknowledged Mat as her greatest rival by explicitly threatening him in front of everyone, thus giving Mat the greatest complement in Seanchan eyes.

All throughout the last book, BS has been using the threat of assassination as a sign of respect. I recall Galgan actually mentioning to Mat how he likes him and wouldn't want him to die so he'll send a newly trained assassin.

Then she looses Gawyn.  Then she sees her sisters dying around her, slaughtered by Taim.  Then sacrifices herself and defeats almost all of the Sharan channelers and Taim himself.

What a sad and triumphant end to one of the most solid and inherently good characters in the series.  Tears were shed.  Rand's reaction to seeing her thread stopped really made it hit home for me.

I’m posting them here for you people :). Before you all say “Why didn’t you ask _____?!”, when I finished the book, it was late at night and I was extremely overtired from reading all night. This is what came to mind a the time. Also, I didn’t want to pester him with too many questions so I had decided ahead of time to limit myself to 4.       
  

**1) Why the decision to leave out the glossary at the end?**  

*Harriet suggested this. She liked the idea of RJ’s words being the last ones in the series, and felt that it was right.*  

 

**2) What did the other letters Verin sent say?**  

*This is one of those I’d rather not answer, as I wish to leave it to fan discussion.*  

**3) Why didn’t Rand immediately find Matt and put him in charge of the armies?**  

*Rand knew where Mat was (the visions.) Therefore, he knew that Mat was with the Seanchan—so in going to find them, and bring them into the battle, he was doing just that. (To an extent.) Also, he understands that with Mat—unlike Perrin—swooping in and ordering him about is a good way to get Mat going the opposite direction. However, Mat also finds his way to where he needs to be. So, Rand decided to let the Pattern work on Mat, and instead focused on preparing Perrin*  

**4) If you had to think into the future of Randland, what do you picture the remaining heroes doing?**  

*Well, in RJ’s notes, Perrin was to be involved in the Outriggers (which would be the story of Mat and Tuon in Seanchan.) So Perrin would make his way there, eventually. (I don’t know how that would have worked with Perrin’s new obligations.) From here, I stray away from cannon (meaning what RJ wanted) and into my own imaginings. I imagine that Rand went to see the world, becoming like Jain Farstrider. Min joined him, and they saw the world. Avi and Elayne spent decades, maybe centuries, leading their own people before retiring to join the other two.*

I started reading The Wheel of Time when I was ten.  More than half a lifetime ago.

I eagerly awaited each new release, wearing out a half dozen copies of each book as I tore through them again and again, keeping the memories fresh in my mind.  These were the first books that I sat down and *read*.  My first real series, the seed that blossomed into a love of reading, a love of learning, a tree whose roots are so very deeply intertwined with my soul.  All thanks to the late James Rigney Jr, and more recently the wonderful Brandon Sanderson.

My memory is not very good.  Much of my childhood is lost to me. I have only vague memories of anything before I was seventeen or so, just shadows and half-glimpsed images.  But The Wheel of Time always remained fresh, given how many times I tore through it.  Almost all of my friends that I still have coherent memory of date from the past three years or so, all except for Rand and Mat and Perrin, Egwene and Moiraine, Siuan and Elayne and Aviendha and Min and a thousand more.  They're my oldest friends.  I've had some pretty awful shit happen to me over the past few years, tragedy and pain and loss that nobody my age should have to suffer.  But my friends were always there for me, and they always will be.

I'm crying as I write this.  I mourn for Bryne and Siuan, I mourn for Egwene and all the others in a very real way.  I'm crying because the last remnant of my childhood that I can actually remember is over.  I'm crying because an Age of my life is over.  Because I can move on now, and it's wonderful.

Thank you, James.  Thank you, Brandon.  Thank you, Harriet.

1359304115.0,86,self.WoT,17dfru,Review the Entire Series (Spoilers All),97,11,46,http://www.reddit.com/r/WoT/comments/17dfru/review_the_entire_series_spoilers_all/,"Now that AMoL is out and mostly digested by fans, it's finally possible to take a critical and analytical work at the series as a whole. Here are a few initial thoughts I've had while considering the WoT in its entirety, but feel free to ignore this and jump right into giving your own views:

Organizationally, the entire series fits nicely into a five-act structure made up of trilogies, with New Spring popped in between books 4 and 5 (to help give added depth to Moraine before she ""dies""). While there are other ways to subdivide the series, separating it into five acts gives good starting and ending points for each ""trilogy"" while also making it easier to see how the long arcs of the series develop over time. I think it also helps to justify the slowness of books 9-11; they constitute the falling action of the series after the ""climax"" of books 6-8 (which ends, after all, with major setbacks or new challenges for every character), with the characters beginning to solve their problems in preparation for the finale.

For all intents and purposes, the finished WoT acts as a textbook for fantasy. It showcases most of the fantasy writer's toolkit, with each individual plot arc or character showing off another facet of the genre. Jordan, in crafting a story that takes place in a world of endlessly repeating patterns, almost invites us to imagine the WoT as an ur-fantasy, the world in which all other fantasy narratives take place. In other words, the WoT can be read as the platonic ideal of the monomyth, to a certain extent.

It also manages to be an interesting social document. Love it or hate it, Jordan's concept of a world in which females are the dominate gender plays out in a variety of interesting ways that invite the reader to examine our own world. This is the major ""issue"" of the series, probably, and what makes it work best is that Jordan never really spells that out for the reader. Other social issues get explored over the course of the series (especially ideas about duty, leadership, cross-cultural understanding, slavery, power, etc.), but the idea of gender relations maintains its primacy. 

Of course, the series also has its issues. For one thing, it is overstuffed; while every reader might disagree as to what should be cut, most have a few plot arcs they could do without. Furthermore, while fans rarely discuss the literary merit of Jordan's work, he served as more of a master craftsman than a poetic genius. His prose is perfectly serviceable, but it's never the reason to be reading, and only rarely rises to the level of artistry we expect from ""serious literature,"" whatever that label means. Perhaps most importantly, Jordan's structuring of the latter half of the series led to books where relatively little occurs, mostly because of the sheer number of plotlines requiring advancement. 

Finally, Sanderson's involvement has to be brought into question. The series is unquestionably marred to some degree in being finished by another author, and Sanderson's strengths and weaknesses are put into stark relief through the contrast with Jordan. However, Sanderson did a better job than many other authors who have taken over a series, with Brian Herbert being the most infamous failure. Ultimately, I feel that Sanderson proved to be a skilled understudy in a difficult role, that his skills as a writer improved markedly from TGS to AMoL, and that he hewed as closely to Jordan's vision for the series as any author could. One must also credit Harriet, who likely wielded more influence than many readers suspect; without her, this endeavor would've proven much more fruitless.

So, **TL;DR**: The Wheel of Time is a fantasy textbook, a surprisingly organized monomyth-machine that showcases the genre's greatest strengths and some of its continued weaknesses.

The theory is as follows.

Padan Fain, in the ending of AMoL, is beginning to refer to himself as Shaisalam, and now has fuller control of the silvery mist that comes from himself.  In his internal dialogue, he mentions that Fain tried to control this mist, but wasn't ""mature"" enough to do so at that time.  Apparently Fain was the larval form of something, and Shaisalam is a more adult version of whatever he's becoming (notice the similarities between ""Shaisalam"" and ""Shaitan"").  The theory is that the Pattern begun spinning out a new Dark One once it knew that Rand MIGHT kill the already existing Dark One.  

So, had Rand defeated the Dark One and killed him, Shaisalam would have grown to be the new, silver Dark One.  Considering what did happen, the Pattern didn't need Fain anymore, so he was given a shitty and anti-climactic death at the hands of Mat.  

Either way, it's a cool theory.",,False,self,t5_2rdg1,False,,,True,t3_18r893,http://www.reddit.com/r/WoT/comments/18r893/a_padan_fain_theory_spoilers_all/,

(spoilers all)",89,9,66,http://www.reddit.com/r/WoT/comments/1391wb/after_114_days_i_have_finally_finished_my_first/,"I just want to say ""wow"". This series is unlike anything I've ever read. The sheer level of depth and detail is staggering. Character development feels genuinely real as they have time to grow naturally rather than having a few hundred pages to develop. 

Rand's story in particular is one of the best I have ever come across in any medium. Jordan had me completely fooled with him: everything Rand did felt entirely justified. Even when you can see him starting to turn evil in the later books, you understand why. He isn't flawed for the sake of being flawed - his flaws make perfect sense given his circumstances. And then Semhirage reveals that he is in fact insane, and I looked back and realised that he really was. He was completely paranoid. He would make reckless decisions out of nowhere. He was constantly listing the name of every woman whose death he had been remotely responsible for. I watched him grow mad without ever truly realising it. 

This series is not perfect. Far from it. One only has to look at book 10 to realise this. The first six books were amazing (especially Dumai's Wells - the last time I was this stunned by a book was the scene that must not be named from ASoIaF, albeit for entirely different reasons). I'd been told that books 7-10 were slower in pace, and while I expected this and still enjoyed being immersed in this world, they really did drag. The level of detail, whilst absolutely incredible, was rather unnecessary a lot of the time. Book 10 in particular deserves some kind of award: 800 pages in which literally nothing happens is quite an achievement.

Thankfully, books 11-13 more than made up for it. After several books of political maneuvering, inner turmoil, and braid-tugging, we finally got back to the plot. Many of the scenes in Sanderson's books are amongst the best in the series. Egwene, who had had very little to do for the last few books depsite being made Amrylin, suddenly became awesome. Her fight in the White Tower was incredible. The darkness that had been slowly growing in Rand finally came to a head. The scene on the Dragonmount rivals Dumai's Wells for me - even though I knew that he wouldn't do it, I was virtually holding my breath reading the final paragraphs of that scene. Perrin finally embracing his inner wolf. Forging his hammer and dismissing balefire pretty much made up for about 6 books worth of sulking from him. And while Sanderon's Mat got off to a shaky start, he felt like Mat again in book 13.

I don't know if I'd rate this as the best fantasy series of all time. For all its strengths, it has many flaws (pacing and many of the female characters being the main offenders), but given the sheer scope of the story being told, I think it is one of the only series that truly deserves the title of epic.",,False,self,t5_2rdg1,False,,Dragon,True,t3_1391wb,http://www.reddit.com/r/WoT/comments/1391wb/after_114_days_i_have_finally_finished_my_first/,

Divide by number of inches in a mile (63360) and we get a final distance of all of the pure text in the books, with no punctuation or spaces, of 46.6 MILES.

First off, it's obviously been foreshadowed since ACoS, when the link between Moridin and Rand was first established (and mentioned in a viewing by Min), if not before. We are also given ample evidence of souls being migrated from one body to another, especially as a method to avoid death. Therefore, I think it's pretty well foreshadowed, definitely moreso than the other popular pre-AMoL theory that Nynaeve would ""cure death."" And certainly more foreshadowed than the third theory, that Rand would die permanently, because Jordan did all but hit us over the head with the fact that Rand would find some way to survive.

I think it's possible to at least begin coming up with a mechanical theory for how the body swap occurred by examining the balefire incident in ACoS. When the two balefire beams crossed in SL, Rand and Moridin simultaneously balefire'd the other's weave, causing it to never have been woven: a paradox. Reacting to this paradox, the Pattern has a Blue-Screen-of-Death moment, unable to resolve the causality cascade (Moridin's weave erased Rand's weave erased Moridin's weave erased...), and the two threads become increasingly indistinguishable. Unfortunately for Rand, this causes him to be able to access the TP without even the scant protection provided by the Dark One, further tainting his channeling ability. It also creates an ambiguity in the Pattern that causes the pain experienced by one body to be felt by the other.

Because the two characters have been conflated by the Pattern into one entity, their participation in the TP/OP circle in the final attack against the Dark One, with huge amounts of both Powers flowing through them, only brings them further closer. In the aftermath of the battle, Rand has ruined his body through burning out, but Moridin is protected due to the properties of circles; he's exhausted, but likely couldn't have been killed. Rand and Moridin, both on the edge of death, collapse outside the cavern, and the link combined with the circle has caused Min's ""two become one"" vision to come true. In that moment, hovering near death, the two souls tied together by the Pattern take advantage of being all mixed up to go to the body that will give them the life or death they respectively desire. 

This is all speculation, but the only reasonable explanation for the body swap must be: Rand and Moridin crossed streams, which caused the weird link to form, which made swapping bodies possible. Any other explanation renders the entire weird linking subplot superfluous to the story. 

But what do you think? Is there some other way the body swap could've happened? ",,False,self,t5_2rdg1,False,,,True,t3_17kp6r,http://www.reddit.com/r/WoT/comments/17kp6r/epilogue_mechanics_question_amol_spoilers/,

Huge fan of WOT, just finished AMOL a few weeks ago, and I haven't been able to stop thinking about the series since. I am just amazed at how well the notion of duality is incorporated. Having said that, throughout the whole series I failed to understand the significance of Ishamael (later Moridin). There are probably a lot of subtle aspects of The Wheel Of Time that my feeble brain never picked up on, but yesterday I was at Soundwave Festival (massive music festival in Australia) when I was drunk and a bit stoned I was discussing AMOL with a friend when he said ""what was going on with Moridin and the ending?"" or something like that. It clicked:

The creator has the dragon. Rand was worried about going mad, remembering past lives. The Dark One has the Naeblis. Ishamael was generally considered mad, claiming to remember being a part of the conflict between the DO and the dragon since the very beginning of time. Except now I realise that Ishamael wasn't mad at all, he was right. If you think of the dragon as the champion of light, tasked with saving reality from the dark, an (arguably) Christ like figure, then the Naeblis is the Champion of the Dark, charged with bringing about the end of everything, an anti Christ.

Maybe that has seemed obvious to some of you? It hit me like a ton of bricks: this character that I never really understood the significance of over the last fifteen years of reading this series, I always considered him to be just an odd insane forsaken who had a bit more insight than the others. I never realised until that moment yesterday that he was the reincarnated soul of the Dark Ones greatest servant.

The duality all fits: Rand is guided by prophecy and a sense of self sacrifice to become the Dragon, to fight the Dark one. Moridin confesses that he is forever bound to the dark one, forced and tortured into his role, the only escape for him will be the oblivion of The Dark One winning. They both are able to remember their past lives. They both have powerful allies, but whereas Rand has fellow Taveren and powerful heroes like Egwene and Nynaeve, plus all the countless characters that make up the forces of Light, people who genuinely love him and want to help him, Moridin has the forsaken, scheming underlings who want nothing more than to take him down, who scheme against him, plus countless darkfriends as fodder for the forces of Darkness.

We know two things about Nakomi.

One, she cares about the Aiel generally, and Aviendha personally.  To me, this is enough to rule out the apparently favored 'avatar of the creator' theory.  Even if the creator is taking a hand in events, he isn't Aiel, so why would he do that?  It also points strongly to Tigraine, who adopted the Aiel culture, and is the grandmother of Aviendha's future kids.  Nokomis is an Iroquois word meaning grandmother, and also specifically refers to the grandmother of Hiawatha, who united several tribes of native americans.  Hardly ironclad, but strong.

Two, for all his friends, his confidants, his adopted father and several adopted mothers (Moiraine, Nynaeve, every Maiden of the Spear), [it was](/s ""Nakomi who was there to comfort Rand as he lay dying on the slopes of Shayol Ghul."")  Everything in WoT has that all-encompassing feeling, the idea that all our myths and religions spring from this.  If thats the feeling you're going for, who do you put at the feet of the messiah as [he](/s ""lays dying?"")  Obvious answer: his mother.  Even having been absent for the entire story, she's the one person who belongs there in that moment.

Now, there's the issue of, how/who/what has she been for the twenty years since we were led to believe she died giving birth on Dragonmount.  In much the same way [Rand](/s ""receives a second chance at life (and unique, perhaps divine magical powers), Tigraine, in return for giving up her position in Andor in favor of a position as a female soldier who lives in the desert, got a second life.  This fits nicely with Nakomi appearing to approve of Rand hauling Moridin's corpse out of the Pit of Doom.  She knows what he has to do to perform a body swap because she's been through something similar.  It also fits nicely with the irregularities in the Aviendha scene that made some people think it happened in T'A'R, her fire barely consumed the logs just like Rand's pipe burned without being lit.  And just as Rand's story is now over and he'll be staying out of the affairs of the world, Tigraine had played her role.  She might have been living in seclusion in the waste for the entirety of Rand's life."")

I know Sanderson and everybody else is clamming up on this one.  I'm hoping I'm right, and I'm hoping there can eventually be a consensus on this, so that keeping it secret won't be worth the effort.

1355319723.0,66,self.WoT,14q354,So how long is the series going to be? RJ's answers from 95 - 06,72,6,44,http://www.reddit.com/r/WoT/comments/14q354/so_how_long_is_the_series_going_to_be_rjs_answers/,"Friend of mine posted this on dragonmount and I got a kick out of it, a timeline of RJ's estimates on just how many books the series was going to be:

1993
 
He still isn't sure how long WoT will go on for, saying probably seven books but adding that when The Eye of the World first came out he saw the series as four books.
 
""At present I am indeed hoping to complete the cycle in either seven or eight books. I am 90% confident that I can do it in seven, 95% confident that I can by eight. The thing is, as a famous manager of an American baseball team once said: 'It ain't over till it's over.'""
 
1994
 
""It will last several more books, until I reach the last scene, which has been in my head since the very beginning.""
 
""I do hope there will not be ten books all told. I'm planning for eight, at present, and hope very strongly that I can wrap it all up in that length.""
 
He said he writes as the ideas come and he has no clue as to how long the series will be!
 
""I knew from the start that I was writing something that would be multiple books. I just never knew how many, exactly.""
 
Not only did he decline to set the number of future WoT books, but he denied ever setting a number and says he never planned it to be only a trilogy. But he seemed to indicate he was planning 9-10 books total. When faced with the prospect of about twelve books, his wife threatened to divorce him and his editor began to make jokes about the Irish Mafia.
 
""Several. Some. A few. I'm not even speculating now on how many books I hope it will take, because every time I do mention a number I hope I can finish it in, it turns out to take longer. It will be at least eight, because I've signed the contracts for books seven and eight.""
 
""I've stopped saying how many more books there will be.""
 
""At one time, I did hope for eight; now I don't think so. I certainly hope (Please, God!) it doesn't go to ten books, but I have stopped saying anything except that I will write until I reach the last scene of the last book, which scene has been in my head from the beginning.""
 
1996
 
""There will be a few more books, some, not a lot, hopefully fewer than seven more.""
 
""It will be at least ten books, yes. There will be some more books, not too many, and please God, not so many as I've already written. I am, in truth, writing as fast as I can. I want to maintain the pace of the story until I reach the final scene, which has been in my head since before I started writing The Eye of the World.""
 
1997
 
""There will be at least three more books. I'm not saying that there will be ONLY three. I'm saying that I can't finish in fewer than three.""
 
1998
 
""I believe—believe!—there will be three more books. I am trying to finish up as soon as possible, but I cannot see how to do it in fewer than three books. That isn't a guarantee, mind! In the beginning, I thought that there would be three or perhaps four books total, but it might go to five, or even six, though I really didn't believe it would take that long. It wasn't a matter of the story growing or expanding, but rather that I miscalculated—brother, did I!—how long it would take to get from the beginning to the end. I've known the last scene of the last book literally from the beginning. That was the first scene that occurred to me. Had I written it out 10 years ago, and then did so again today, the wording might be different, but not what happens. It has just taken me longer to get there than I thought.""
 
""When I finished A Crown of Swords, I said it would take me at least three books more to finish. Now that I have completed The Path of Daggers, it looks like it will take me at least three more books to finish. Believe me, guys, I'm trying as hard as I can to get there as fast as I can.""
 
""I don't have a set amount of books planned. I believe it will take at least three more books to reach the ending that I have known for more than 15 years.""
 
""Remember, after A Crown of Swords I said at least three more books....the same thing I say now.""
 
The usual ""at least three more books"" was mentioned several times in an increasingly loud voice.
 
""I am only asked that question by about 300 people a day. The answer is that there will be at least three more books. At least. As I said earlier, I know everything that I want to happen and I have known the last scene of the last book for fifteen years. I also know that I cannot get everything that I want to happen into less than three more books. So that's where we stand at the moment.""
 
1999
 
Firstly, RJ said three more books ""at least"" and that he'd try to do it in three if he could, but he couldn't promise it would be only three. And he said he thought it would take ""at least five years"".
 
2000
 
""Sigh! At least three more. I know I’ve said that before, but it’s still the case.""
 
""It still sits at three more books to finish, but I've always said from the time I began using the three books that it would be AT LEAST three books—that I'd try to finish in at least three books, but I couldn't promise. I know that I couldn't possibly finish in fewer than three. If I can finish in three, I will. But that's what I'm hoping for, what I'm trying for. NOT a promise.""
 
""There is no set number. It takes as much space as it takes.""
 
2001
  
The next book will be out very soon after he's finished writing it. He don't know how many more books there'll be. At least three. If he can finish it in three, he will.
 
There will be no more than five, but also no less than another three books to be expected to appear in The Wheel of Time series.
 
""There will be at least three more books. The next book will be in bookstores very shortly after I finish writing it, and Michael Jordan is my kid brother whom I taught to play basketball.""
 
2002
 
""After Crossroads of Twilight, there will be two more books, knock wood, God willing and the creek don’t rise. I never intended The Wheel of Time to be this long. The story is progressing the way I planned, but from the beginning I believed I could tell it in many fewer words, many fewer volumes.""
 
""I think twelve.""—Harriet
 
2003
 
When asked ""how many more books?"", which of course met great laughter, he responded that he had started the process intending to have only five or six. Now on book 10, he remarked that he would complete the series in two more books if at all possible. If not, then three.
 
Jordan showed up around 7, and gave a little speech. He said there will be at least two books, and that he will not write a word more than he has to.
 
""How many more books will there be? There will be at least two more books. I apologize for that. I cannot finish it in fewer books. I will try to finish it in two more. I have known the last scene of the last book since 1984. I know where I'm going. The problem is...[my tape is once again inaudible and this was one of the few parts of his speech I could not hear, sorry gang]. That's about it.""

""I really hope—knock wood, spit over your shoulder, and sacrifice to the gods—that I can finish up in twelve books total. We shall see.""
 
""No, at least two more books, I’m afraid....I’ve had some people say they’d like five or ten, but I generally throw something at them.""
 
2004
 
""I hope—please God, are you listening?—that there will be only two more books in the main sequence.""
 
""I very much hope to finish in two more main sequence books. It's not an absolute promise, but I'm very much hoping for it and I think I can do it.""
 
""I sincerely hope it will be possible to tie everything up in two books.""
 
2005
 
There is only one book left in the series but it will be a doozy. He will fight to prevent it from being ""George R.R. Martined,"" or split for publication.
 
""I am committed it is going to be 12 books, even if it is fifteen hundred pages long and it requires you to bring a luggage cart to get it out of the store. Bring your knapsack, you may need it, because no matter what the case that is going to be it.""
 
""One more—the twelfth book. That will be so even if that book has to be 2000 pages in hardcover, and require a luggage cart and shoulder strap to get it out of the store.""
 
""I have said it before and will say it again. There will be one more book. Even if it has to be a 1500 page book. It will be the last book even if you have to use a luggage cart to move it.""
 
""For Segovia, my intention is finish with twelve books, and that may mean that the last book will be VERY long, but I really can't say how long it will take me to write. My publisher is always trying to get me to commit to a time frame. I just do a little sand dance until he goes away. I carry a small bottle of sand with me in New York for exactly that purpose.""
 
Book Twelve will end the main sequence if he has to personally go to New York and beat the publishers at Tor, even if it runs two thousand pages and they have to invent a new way to bind the books (shudder). There will be two more prequels a la New Spring, and there might—very big MIGHT—be another trilogy in the same universe.
 
First, ""the next book will be out very shortly after I'm done writing it."" Next, ""the next book will be the last book, even if it's 2000 pages, and you need a luggage cart to carry it out of the bookstore.""
 
""Can we all say it together? One more book. I don't care if it has to be 2000 pages and you have to wheel it out the door. One more book.""
 
2006
 
""After Knife of Dreams, there's going to be one more main-sequence Wheel of Time novel, working title A Memory of Light. It may be a 2,000-page hardcover that you'll need a luggage cart and a back brace to get out of the store. (I think I could get Tor to issue them with a shoulder strap embossed with the Tor logo, since I've already forced them to expand the edges of paperback technology to nearly a thousand pages!) Well, it probably won't be that long, but if I'm going to make it a coherent novel it's all got to be in one volume.""",,False,self,t5_2rdg1,False,,Fang,True,t3_14q354,http://www.reddit.com/r/WoT/comments/14q354/so_how_long_is_the_series_going_to_be_rjs_answers/,

This is most obvious with the First Oath: ""I shall speak no word that is not true."" Moiraine tells us at one point that an Aes Sedai cannot write a lie any more than they can speak one, but writing isn't part of the oath. It's my theory that Accepted about to swear go into it with a thorough understanding of what the First Oath means: ""I will not communicate any information that cannot, in some way, be interpreted as literally true."" This encompasses all Aes Sedai word twisting (""You may call me Lady Alys""), and also would encompass the written word.

But what if an Accepted took the Oaths with an alternative definition in mind? She could swear the Second Oath, ""I shall make no weapon for one man to kill another,"" while thinking ""I shall make no weapon for *one* man to kill another"" and designing weapons in her head that would require a two-man team to operate. Or the Aes Sedai who is a fan of A Song of Ice and Fire swearing ""I shall make no weapon for one man to kill an *Other*,"" which leaves the Night's Watch out to dry but leaves her free to make weapons to kill other things.

But the First Oath is where we can really have some fun. The first alternative interpretation is obvious: ""I shall *speak* no word that is not true,"" after which the new Aes Sedai could write some salacious tell-alls about the hashish-fueled orgies going on in the Hall of the Tower. Or a way Mesaana could have sworn the Oath and squeezed out of trouble: ""I shall speak no *word* that is not true."" With this emphasis, Mesaana couldn't speak untrue *words*, but nothing would stop her from speaking untrue *sentences* - if someone asked her ""Are you a Forsaken?"" she could not say ""No,"" but she could say, ""I am not a Forsaken"" - there isn't a single untrue word in that sentence, even though they add up to a lie. (one could argue that ""not"" is untrue, but I would disagree, because saying ""I'm not not a Forsaken"" is a true sentence. The word ""not"" itself isn't the problem.)

And finally, my favorite interpretation of the First Oath: ""I shall speak no word that is not 'true.'"" Pity the poor Accepted who accidentally thinks this while swearing the First Oath, and isn't able to swear the 2nd and 3rd since all she can say is ""True.""",,False,self,t5_2rdg1,False,,Dice,True,t3_1bla57,http://www.reddit.com/r/WoT/comments/1bla57/alternative_interpretations_of_the_three_oaths/,

I have to say, after rereading the series, this is by far my favorite thing about the series.  It is so...believable.  I was thinking about other protagonists of other series and I realized how hard it is for an author to write about a character doing the wrong thing in a believable way.  Every character either always makes the right decision, or makes some obviously stupid and ridiculous mistake that is an obvious ploy to give a character flaws.  

With Rand though, I found myself agreeing with his decisions, without even realizing I was following him down the wrong path.  His flaws weren't just put in for the sole reason of giving him flaws.  (Sanderson, I'm looking at you in Mistborn) but were the result of understandable decisions)

4. Nynaeve and Moiraine have no ideal what Rand was doing in the last battle.

So it's possible the world might think the Dark One destroyed. And in time he'll fade from memory and that will set the stage for the next time the bore is opened in a future age of legends.

I started this morning the first WoT book. I consider myself a new fantasy reader, even though I started reading pretty young (around 11), with Harry Potter and Narnia, and soon after Lord of the Rings and the Hobbit, I never really got into fantasy literature until last year, when I read the first chapters of Game of Thrones. I got crazy for fantasy, crazy, crazy, I needed other worlds, other realities, I needed magic!
After a whole year dedicated to fantasy literature reading (Lord of the Rings, Game of Thrones, Kingkiller Chronicles, Belgariad, Mistborn, Narnia) I've finally decided to start the Wheel of Time. Now you must be asking: Why didn't you read it before? Well I wanted to get used to the genre, get my own opinions and tastes around it before reading the biggest epic fantasy there is out there (everyone talks about it!!). But the day finally came, and today I started reading the first chapters of the Eye of the World.
Often I find myself wishing I could go back in time and re-read my favorite books without knowing what is coming next, being surprised is my favorite part of a reading experience. Today I started reading about Rand and Tam, and the Two Rivers. The legends of the Dragon (I still don't understand that quite well yet) and how he ""broke the world"" (is that right?). Today I started reading humors about 5 False Dragons out in the world (how big is it really? I often find myself confused looking at the map, I still did not find Two Rivers there, but I will! haha), and really got excited about that, I guess that means war? 
But most importantly, how does everything has to do with Rand? And what is the Wheel of Time?
I'm about to start the fourth chapter, but before doing so I decided to come in here and share this with you. If you are in this subreddit, it means you really like the series and you care about it, but never forget the first pages you read and how you fell in love with it. I know I will miss these pages a year from now, probably laughing at my guesses, but that's what makes epic fantasies the most wonderful thing in the world.

By the end of that vacation I had finished the book, and probably drove my parents a little crazy by sitting at a picnic table for most of my time in Florida.  I couldn't help it, I was hooked.  
I read the other 3 books that had already been released just in time for the 4th book, The Shadow Rising, to be released.  

From there I settled into a pattern of waiting every year or two for a new book in the series to be released, and it was like a new Christmas had been added to the calendar (often I received the new book as a Christmas present) 

In March 2006 I learned that the creator of the series had been diagnosed with a rare condition that gave him a life expectancy of about 4 years.  I was crushed, I knew 4 years would not be enough for Jordan to finish his Magnum Opus, and that not being in good health would make it even more unlikely that he would complete his epic.  Between the announcement of his illness and his passing no new books came out, and although he had initially been given 4 years to live, he passed a little more than a year and a half after being diagnosed.  

Was it over? No, another young author was chosen to take up the story where Robert Jordan left off.  Brandon Sanderson took over the series and released his first book based on the notes of RJ in 2009.  
It was a wonderful book.  It gave me confidence that the series was in absolutely the right hands.  The Final Book of The Wheel of Time, Book 14, A Memory of Light, was released January 2013.  
I intentionally read it as slowly as I could to keep the end from coming, but tonight it happened.  The story is ended, and my time in Randland over.  I spent the last 20 years waiting for the next book, and now there is no next book.

All I have to say now that I have reached the end of the road is, Thank you Robert Jordan, and Brandon Sanderson.

“I will, Verin,” Egwene promised. “But your soul is not Brown. I can see it.”

As far as I've noticed, you've all been using spoiler tags liberally and thats awesome, but I just wanted to put the guidelines out there again.

Please remember that not everyone wishes to read anything about or from A Memory of Light until its release in January. To keep things peachy around here, **please** remember to use spoiler tags not only on information pertaining to aMoL, but to **any** story or plot points of the books in general. 

Another reminder, please be at least book specific when titling posts and remember to keep spoilers in general out of titles as well. Titles such as ""The Dark One (Spoilers)"" are acceptable and will be permitted, but I want to try and keep discussions and the community as open as possible. When we title things more specifically, such as ""The Seanchan and Kaf (TSR spoilers)"", we open the discussion to more individuals who know they can enter the discussion without fear of spoiling books they haven't read. 

One more important point for you all: ***Please remember to place book specific titles on spoilers that go outside of the book being discussed in the thread.*** 

For example, if we were talking about kaf and somehow Tarmon Gai'don gets brought up and you wanted to talk about events before Tarmon Gai'don, you would say [ToM Spoiler](/s ""Rand's armies will meet up on the Plains of Merrilor for the last battle."") since the spoiler happens outside of The Shadow Rising, the book being discussed. 

This is key to preventing accidental spoilage of huge plot points (the above is a very small and unimportant spoiler) to those who thought that the only topics that would be brought up in the discussion would pertain to the book being discussed. 

I know it seems like a lot, but it's all to keep the community as fair and open to as many people as possible. Thanks for sticking with me, and the Light shine on you all!

Edit: As a clarification, spoiler tags on comments are only necessary if they extend to books beyond the ones being discussed. They are not needed in threads where all books are being discussed.

(AMOT Spoilers),66,13,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/WoT/comments/17pvhi/nakomis_identity_and_the_metapoetry_of_switching/,"I was re-reading the AMOL epilogue over lunch, and a few things occurred to me. First, I think Nakomi is an avatar for the Creator, and probably a stand-in for Harriet herself. She's a gray-haired Aiel, and her role in the series is much like Harriet's role as editor/wife/caretaker for Jordan. The story has been filtered through her, like an avatar, she has been there to set it on the right path when needed, like Nakomi did for Aviendha, and Nakomi's (apparent) appearance in the epilogue's first paragraph really cemented her role for me. Even her words seem strangely out of place in AMOL. ""Yes, that's good. That is what you need to do."" Sounds like something an editor/wife would say to her writer husband. I don't think this is something we'll ever find out for sure, but it's a nice thought.

Second, has anyone considered the irony of Rand switching bodies at the end, much like the books themselves, passing from Jordan to Sanderson? The embodiment of the main character literally switches owners. Again, there is no way to tell if this was remotely intentional on Jordan's part, but even if it wasn't, it strikes me as a peculiar example of life imitating art. 

This book really affected me more than I thought it would. I've been reading this series for twelve years, and none of the other books left me feeling this way. It's pretty tough to leave these characters behind.

First off, since this started as something to do until the next book of ASOIAF, let me say this; I like WoT more than I like ASOIAF, so far that is. Here is the orginal thread that started me off in this journey, http://www.reddit.com/r/WoT/comments/1fm1me/no_spoilers_i_just_finished_a_dance_with_dragons/

I just wanted to share with you guys some of my highlights from the first 3 books:

1) I laugh every ime one of the guys says about the others. ""I wish _blank_ was here, _blank_ always knows how to talk to the girls."" I don't know why, but it gets me every time. There are also recurring funny parts that tickle me here and there.

2) One of my favorite scenes was the first time Rand tried to use the Portal Stone on purpose, and it went through all the different lives that could have been, touching on some multiverse theory. In particular, I loved the one where the people from Two Rivers were fighting, almost laughing, saying ""I feel like I've done this before"", or something to that extent.

3) On that note, I love how the old blood seems to creep up here and there randomly, like when the boys start speaking the old tongue, like its in their DNA.

4) I'm really into things like /r/Psychonaut/, Mysticism, Sacred Geometry, Duality, Multiverse, Choice vs Destiny, and just thinking of what it means to exist in general. This book touches on almost all of those types of things. To me, I feel as if the True Source is like a drug for these women, and being stilled must be like one of the worst withdraws ever faced. The idea of the Dark One existing as a Paradox is pretty cool. As long as he is trapped in one, universe, he is trapped in all of him, but at the same time if he is released in one, he is released in all of them. It kind of makes me think of something akin to Neo in the Matrix, the Dark one almost represents the Randomness in the universe, which actually gives us the choice of free will, as opposed to everything be destined according to the pattern. It almost a paradox in itself that he needs to exist, to give our lives meaning, and the creator knew that.

5) Mat Cauthon is slowly becoming my favorite character. I love gambling, I love that rush, I love pressing my luck. I could sense a twinge of luck coming from him, like in Book 1 when he nailed that monster in the Waste right in the eye, but I didn't realize it was going to get this crazy. That scene when in Tar Valon where he fights the prince, and his half-brother with his staff, I had no clue he was that much of a bad ass. He quite a funny little shit too. 

6) The outpacing of events for Moraine: I like how its kind of knocked her down a notch in my head, as in, she's not so much of a bad ass as first expected. 

7) I really seems like books 2 and 3 have followed a particular pattern. Everyone starts off kind of together, then separates, then slowly things start piecing back together in a giant crescendo, where they all find themselves in an absolute shitstorm. To me, its like continuous big bangs happening over and over again. ( there is a theory on time/universe that kind follows this thought, you guys might enjoy this, but be warned, it gets really heady. [
Fractal Minds and the Sacred Cosmology : Neuroscience &amp; Psychology meets Esoteric Religion
](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;list=UUMVPQtymrz3ypQfpFFxypaQ&amp;v=OHSyOcMuYHY#t=6796s) )

These little big bangs at the end of each book are like a fractal smaller big bang that is going to happen at the end of the series, at the end of the 4th age. And all of the ends of the ages are like a smaller fractal version of the original beginning of time, when The Creator created the Wheel, and the Dark One.

2. that he was Charlz Guybon (with the Andoran army). 

Only Roedran really fit with all of the details we had been given, but Guybon was physically described in a similar way, to sum up the arguments.

In any case, obviously neither turned out to be correct. There were enough references to Shara that none of us should have been surprised to see the Sharans play a role in the Last Battle; I'm only sad that they didn't get earlier page time, because they would be very fun to read about, I think. The brief descriptions we get of their society are fascinating.

Here, in this brief passage I quote above, I feel like Sanderson (and I think this is Sanderson's writing) is laughing at our theories. Rand is our foil: he has been convinced, as so many were, that Murandy was where Demandred was hiding. And he finally gets to meet Roedran, and lo!, it is not him at all. I think this was one of the moments in *A Memory of Light* where I laughed aloud.

The west and the south must be as one. The two must be as one. If you would live, you must die.""

Rand himself, as well as all of us AFAIK, interpreted ""The two must be as one"" as referring to the prior sentences, meaning that the Seanchan conquests and Rand's conquests needed to be allied for the Last Battle to be won.

BUT.... I think instead ""The two must be as one"" applies to the **following** sentence--""If you would live, you must die"". In other words, it's about the necessity for Rand and Moridin to merge somehow, at the end of which only Rand will survive. (This is also supported by Min's viewing in aCoS that Rand and someone else will merge and only one will survive, which Rand thought meant Lews Therin but I think probably actually refers to Moridin.)

So I predict that at some point in aMoL Rand will realize that he got this wrong, and that if he wants to survive he needs to merge somehow with Moridin.

Rand's ta'veren nature assured she would be in a condition to be able to help him--and that meant affecting events in the world so she wouldn't lose her bonded warder.

So, as odd as it sounds, helping Rand instead of Lan is exactly what Nynaeve needed to do in order to protect and safeguard Lan.

1363022492.0,47,self.WoT,1a3bd3,Tin foil hat long post - How Harry Potter actually uses the One Power.,66,19,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/WoT/comments/1a3bd3/tin_foil_hat_long_post_how_harry_potter_actually/,"OK, bear with me. I was reading Harry Potter and the Deadly Hallows to my nephew last night and apparently started thinking to much. At one point, Hermione casts ""Alohamora"". (opens locks for the non readers) I started trying to figure out how that would work in the WoT sense. An easy answer is that they aren't the same type of magic, but i present to you that HP magic is simply a high level of WoT magic.

In HP a word is tied to the spell. Speak the word and you get the spell. You have to know the name of the spell and you have to know the hand movement. (Swish and Flick for ""Wingardium Leviosa"" - levitation). In WoT, you would simply wrap them in flows of air and lift. In this sense the WoT power is easier and more powerful. However, as the weaves get more complicated the HP spells are much easier. HP Avada Kadavra and apparation still simply require the command while WoT Balefire and Traveling require specific knowledge of the weave and correct execution.

So how do the two relate, you ask? To answer that I must explain the most significant difference.

HP requires a wand and WoT does not. Its obvious that the wand must a very powerful ter'angreal. What's not clear is how it works. I however, have been blessed by the light with the answer to this.

In the 4th age, knowledge of the source is racing forward. A nameless Brown is trying to solve the problem of simplified learning. The White and Black Towers have exploded with so many new students that training has become expediated and there is a growing problem of burn outs and deaths. Her first thought was angreals since they had nice buffers to prevent that sort of thing, but making very powerful angreals using the Seed greatly decreased the creators own power for a time. While experimenting, however, she realized that she could make an extremely weak angreal that didn't increase the users power, but did have a buffer that wouldn't let you overdo yourself. Since they did not require extra power from the Aes Sedai that created it, these could be mass produced and the first precurser to the HP wands were born.

Great, you say. An angreal that actually limits your power. What good is that? Well my friends, now the fun begins.

This same brown is still studying. Her weak angreals have decreased burn outs, but they are still having to expediate training and many student still have trouble learning the actual weaves. Looking at her new ter'angreal, she realizes that if she can modify a well so that instead of just storing power, it stores the actual weave. Drawing all 5 elements into the modified well, it would be able to take what it needed from her and output the preformatted weave. Think of it like a computer function. You input the power and it returns the weave. This came with significant drawbacks, however. She wanted a multipurpose tool. What good is it if you have to use a different ter'angreal for each weave?

Tired, she decides to take a walk. She finds herself at the port, where a Seanchan vessel is docked. She shudders, still upset that the Dragon's Peace meant that they had to deal with these people. These people who enslaved channelers, forcing them to perform weaves--- Weaves that they themselves can't see and don't know!!! Thrilled, and slightly disturbed that a'dams just thrilled her, she runs back to her quarters. A'dams! A'dams force the wearer to perform the weave. With that she completed her work. Instead of linking 2 people, this a'dam connects the Aes Sedai to the well. The compulsion aspect of the a'dam enables her to create identifiers for each specific weave that was loaded into the ter'angreal. This meant that no one had to learn the actual weaves anymore. Simply holding the wand and giving it the command produced the same result.

And that, my friends, is how the Harry Potter wand and magic came from the Wheel of Time source.
 
TL;DR: Harry Potter's wand is a very complex ter'angreal. It is a modified well and modified a'dam, with a buffer like that in an angreal to stop burnouts. The modified well stores weaves instead of raw power. The Aes Sedai channels all 5 powers into the well and uses the command. The modified a'dam interprets the command and forces the well to output the spell.",,False,self,t5_2rdg1,False,,,True,t3_1a3bd3,http://www.reddit.com/r/WoT/comments/1a3bd3/tin_foil_hat_long_post_how_harry_potter_actually/,

It occurred to me though, that another event shares remarkably similar events as this though.  When Lews Therin kills Ilyena in his madness, he is very much in the same position as Rand.  He has already faced the Dark One, though it could be said that the Breaking could be considered the ""last storm"" as it marks the end of the Age of Legends, destroying a land that had already been dying from the touch of the Dark One during the War of Power.  He is blind to his actions through the madness, just like Rand, and Ishamael appears and heals the madness so Lews Therin can see what he has done and weep for it.  He then destroys himself, raising Dragonmount, the site of his grave where he had been standing.

Exactly.

This was clarified further in Winter's Heart, 'A Lily in Winter'.

From TPD when Elayne ""experiments"" with the rod (of pleasure):
&gt;And then there was the crimson rod that felt hot. Hot, in a way.  
   Sitting on the edge of her bed at an inn called The Wild Boar, she examined the smooth rod by the light of two polished brass lamps. Wrist-thick and a foot long, it looked like stone, but felt firm rather than hard. She was alone; since the helmet, she had tried to do her studying away from the others. The heat of the rod made her think of Fire...  
   Blinking, she opened her eyes and sat up in the bed. Sunlight streamed in at the window. She was in her shift, and Nynaeve, fully dressed, stood frowning down at her. Aviendha and Birgitte were watching from beside the door.  
   ""What happened?"" Elayne demanded, and Nynaeve shook her head grimly.  
   ""You don’t want to know."" Her lips twitched.  
   Aviendha’s face gave away nothing. Birgitte’s mouth might have been a little tight, but the strongest emotion Elayne felt from her was a combination of relief and – hilarity! The woman was doing her utmost not to roll on the floor laughing!  
   The worst of it was, noone would tell what had happened. What she had said, or done; she was sure it was that, by the quickly hidden grins she saw, from Kinswomen and Windfinders as well as sisters. But no one would tell her! After that, she decided to leave studying the ter’angrealto somewhere more comfortable than a inn. Somewhere definitely more private!  

The only bit I could find as ""clarification"" in WH, A Lilly in Winter:

&gt; Squeezing her eyes shut, she sobbed, just once, and whimpered, ""Two months!"" Shaking free of them, she straightened and fixed Aviendha with blue eyes clear as water and hard as ice.

It'll probably be ten years before GRRM releases the next book, however, and so I'm trying The Wheel of Time series out.

I'm about 30% through the book, which is early, I know. And I really, really want to like these books. I just have a two questions about this series because I'm already getting really frustrated, which isn't a good sign, and these things are both really important to me.
 
1. Are there any female characters who aren't stubborn, authoritative, competent and humorless? So far Moiraine, Egwene and Nynaeve seem to all have the exact same character.

2. Are there any anti-heroes? I don't need the total gray area assholes that seem to be 100% of the characters in ASOIAF, but it'd be nice to know if there's one in the whole series.

I'm enjoying this book a lot. But varied women and complicated heroes are a big factor for me, and so if the answer is a massive NO in both cases, then I'm not sure I want to invest time to this series.

PS, the ""Burn me"" thing is grating, too. In the words of Bunny Colvin from The Wire, ""I never understood why a grown-ass man gotta talk like that. He mean's 'fuck me', whether he knows it or not.""

PSS, why are two out of the three girls so massively sexist? I suppose its interesting as a reversal of general misogyny in other fantasy, but it seems like women are held in equal esteem as men, even ruling in Two Rivers, so Egwene and Nynaeve always saying things like ""I thought you were bright, for a man"" or ""Men always think with their chest hair"" when no man so far has been rude about women just comes off as super sexist.

**Edit:** Thanks so much for the great answers! Especially considering it's four in the morning West Coast time.

Saying that he will break the seals gives him 2 advantages:

1. Everyone is forced to meet him, to support or oppose.
2. Bargaining position. He only needs to convince them to break the seals, he can give up on the date in exchange for something else, either agreement to the Dragon's Peace or another scheme he's running.

We've seen in Rand's POVs, even in AMoL Ch.1, that he doesn't know what to do once he breaks the seals. And as we've seen throughout the series, Rand has become very good at Daes Dae'mar. He is also perhaps more familiar with the Prophecies of the Dragon than any other character.

 He can give up the decision on when to Egwene, as long as she agrees that the seals must be broken at some point. And we saw in her POV in AMoL Ch.1 that she does agree with that, partly based on the Prophecies.

It's in the chapter where Sammael and Graendal are talking about the rest of the Chosen and how to deal with Rand.  During this Sammael thinks:  ""Events to the south had Demandred's mark all over them.  Demandred had always liked using proxies.""  He then says to Graendal, ""So long as they steer clear of me, his lackeys can carve out what he wants, but they will steer clear or he will answer for it.""  Even if Sammael does not know where Demandred is exactly, he seems to know at least places he has had a hand in affecting.  With Graendal in Arad Doman, to the South lies Tarabon, Amadicia, and Ghealdan.  These are the places in which the Dragonsworn are ravaging the countryside.  

Later in the books (I'd have to dig to find it, and I don't remember which one), Masema talks about the Dragon having appeared to him surrounded by light and in a kind of divine magnificence.  It's clear that Masema is mad, and could be regarded as a kind of vision contained within his madness, but I think his fervor and worship of Rand could be a sign of a kind of Compulsion.  The rest of the Dragonsworn seem to share this fervor, and eagerness to follow the Dragon.  With the Dragonsworn spread all across Randland by the end of the books (Masema and many of his followers are killed by Aiel/Faile, but the Dragonsworn are still spread out all over the place), it seems to me that those could be the ""armies"" that Demandred refers to.  It would also explain why he would need Moghedien to take charge of one, as they would be spread out, and he could not command them on his own.  It would also explain why he and Taim would know each other, as Demandred's strategy seems to involve turning those sworn to the Dragon, while not being directly under Rand, against him.  

My theory is that Demandred is not someone else, but has been posing as Rand for many of the Dragonsworn, helping them spread Chaos throughout Randland, and sowing madness and zeal throughout their ranks.  When it is time for them to join the Last Battle, Demandred will pose as Rand and bring the Asha'man with Taim to bring them under his banner, claiming that he is the true Dragon, and they must bring down the pretender, Rand.  I think this fits pretty well with Demandred's characteristic of jealousy of Lews Therin, by him taking what should belong to Rand and using it against him.",,False,self,t5_2rdg1,False,,,True,t3_10bsju,http://www.reddit.com/r/WoT/comments/10bsju/another_demandred_theory_lord_of_chaos_and_onward/,

With Sanderson's two books so fresh in mind I've come to realize what I I dislike about the middle part of the series.  And it's that at this point Perrin gets involved in little subplots without ever meeting major characters until the final trilogy.  He becomes terribly *stagnate.*

A brief summary of what happens to Perrin from Path of Daggers until you start The Gathering Storm.

1. Perrin loses Faile and Morgase and Perrin gets them back.

3. Perrin continues to brood over his forced leadership with no resolution.

4. Perrin cotinues to brood over his axe vs. hammer with no resolution.


What he has/is during the middle of Path of Daggers is pretty much what he is had/is after the prologue of Gathering Storm except: Aram's dead. Masema's dead. Shaido sub story is resolved. And some Seanchan trust/respect  Perrin.

Now, I'm not disparaging *any* of these plot points, because each are vital to the final resolution.  But it's all he does for three and a half books!

I think Perrin chapters after Path of Daggers up until Gathering Storm might be worth skipping on future read throughs.

Crossroads of Twilight is as bad as it gets, and really took me a long time to read through, it's painfully bad and I can see why people gave up around the time this book came out, but I am glad I stuck with it because Knife of Dreams is really good.

Looking forward to see Sanderson's take on the series, and even though I wasn't around since the beginning of the series I am a little sad that my journey with Robert Jordan is coming to an end.

I was at the Toronto AMOL signing last night, and one of the things Brandon mentioned was that Robert had plans for TWO more WOT trilogys! 

He then killed all our hope by saying that there will not be any more WOT books as per Roberts request. The WOT is done. 

He also mentioned that the sequels only had one sentence each for a description. He didn't say what they were out loud as it could spoil AMOL for people. 

I asked him what they were as I was getting my books signed and this is what he said:

The first is ""Perrin is going to Shara to kill an old friend"" 

And the second is:

""Matt lying in a gutter wearing a tattered cloak""

I'm thinking the perrin one could be him going to kill Rand or Gaul. Could also be long tooth. I it could also be ""old friend"" in a sarcastic way and could be some form of slayer returned. 

The matt one is could him having issues with the rebels back in seanchan? That ones very vague.

The epilogue seemed a little too short.  So I decided to compile a list of fun scenes of my own that I would have loved to read with the flair of sanderson's/jordan's voice.

1.  Perrin going toe to toe with the wise ones in the World of Dreams.  I loved the story arc for Perrin (even though the middle area got a little dreary).  By the end of the Last Battle he has become, in my opinion, one of the most powerful people alive.  I would love to see him teach the wise woman a thing or two about their world of dreams.  After two or three books of everyone calling him a young pup, it would be nice to see him as the master in his element.  The scene with him flitting between worlds with each heartbeat, pursuing slayer relentlessly was nothing short of AWESOME.  I wanted more.

2.  Mat and Rand gambling together in a tavern somewhere.  Mat with his luck, and Rand with his new ability to bend the pattern to his will.  It would be funny to see which would win out.  Would Mat be surprised as every lucky toss suddenly turns into a losing one?

3. Not particularly a scene, but I wanted to see more of the Avienda Elayne ter'angreal making combo.  Watch them herald in the new age with breathtaking advancements.  Finally  unlock the once unattainable secret and create a ter'angreal for flying.  Make a ter'angreal to allow Traveling for the common man.

4.  Going off on a tangent here because my mind is still reeling from just finishing the series, but I had really hoped that at least one of the chosen would see the light.  I know it was a huge longshot, since they had been evil for centuries, and were corrupted beyond measure, but I still held out hope that one of them would finally rebuke the Dark One (Lanfear kinda did, but she didn't come any closer to the Light by doing so).  Moridin seemed close to it, or Lanfear maybe.  I do like how the Lanfear arc ended though.  It was very fitting.  She seems to be making strides toward the light, but really it was all a ploy for power and revenge on Lews Therin.

There isn't really a lot of information here, but I thought other people might be interested in what I found.

- Thom Merrilyn -- Merlin, King Arthur's adviser. Thom is also a wise man and skilled in various ways, guiding Rand and Mat at various points.
- Al'Lan Mandragoran -- Lancelot, the greatest knight to ever live. Lan is one hell of a soldier, and the only person able to best Demandred in hand-to-hand combat.
- Egwene -- Guinevere initially loves Arthur, but falls in love with another person. Or perhaps the Lady of the Lake (Avalon).

places

- Tor Valon as Avalon, the mystic isle where Arthur goes to die.

things

- sa'angreal as san graal -- the holy grail http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sangreal

1357241796.0,37,self.WoT,15wj9g,Pre-Memory of Light summary (Spoilers through the end of Towers of Midnight),46,9,40,http://www.reddit.com/r/WoT/comments/15wj9g/prememory_of_light_summary_spoilers_through_the/,"I’ve seen a bunch of people asking this, and rather than send them to [Encyclopedia WoT](http://www.encyclopaedia-wot.org/) or the [WoT Re-read](http://www.tor.com/features/series/wot-reread) to have to read a chapter-by-chapter breakdown, I thought I’d try to sum everything up.

This won’t include any of the released aMoL material.

The world is in trouble. The Dark One’s touch has everything rotting and decaying, and food is becoming a major problem. Trollocs have invaded the Borderlands, and though Rand was able to stop them in Saldaea, it can be presumed that the rest of the Borderlands are being overrun.

Rand is gathering his armies at the Field of Merillor, north of Tar Valon, in preparation for Tarmon Gai’don. He has announced his intention to shatter the three remaining Seals on the Dark One’s prison. Egwene, as Amyrlin of the reunited, Black Ajah-purged Aes Sedai, is gathering rulers and armies in opposition to this. Elayne, with her forces, stands with Egwene, and Perrin with his forces (including Galad and the Whitecloaks) are standing with Rand.

Rand has found peace again. Lews Therin Telamon is no longer a voice in his head, though he has all of LTT’s memories. He is at peace with himself, and able to do incredible things with the Power. He no longer has the Choedan Kal, having destroyed it at the end of tGS. His very presence seems able to counter the Dark One’s touch on the world; plants will literally start sprouting in his presence. When last we saw him, he saw Cyndane/Lanfear in his dreams, pleading with Rand to help her.

Perrin has gotten himself together, finally. He’s made his peace with being a wolfbrother, and found his balance. He’s trained in the World of Dreams to the point where he is even better there than Egwene (including being able to deflect balefire). The forces under his command know about the wolves, so we can assume that everyone does. He’s got a really cool hammer.

Mat, along with Thom, succeeded in rescuing Moiraine from the Aelfinn and the Eelfinn, though it cost Mat an eye. Noal, a.k.a. Jain Farstrider, sacrificed himself so they could escape. Moiraine and Thom professed their love for one another, to Mat’s shock.

Lan has reached Tarwin’s Gap, with the remnants of the Malkieri. When we last saw him, his army of about 10,000 was charging at the approximately 100,000 Trollocs camped in the Gap.

The Band of the Red Hand is at Caemlyn, awaiting Mat’s return, under Talmanes’ command. Olver opened the letter that Verin left for Mat, which warned him that Trollocs were about to invade Caemlyn via the presumed-secure Waygate. Talmanes reads the letter, and rushes outside to see Caemlyn (where Aludra’s Dragons are stored) burning.

Mazrim Taim is firmly in control of the Black Tower, and while it hasn’t been *technically* confirmed that he is a Darkfriend, it’s as certain as things can be. Logain’s faction, which is loyal to Rand, is dwindling; the Asha’man in it, and their allied Aes Sedai, are switching sides at an alarming rate. Presumably, Taim is turning them using the trick of 13 Dreadlords channeling through 13 Myrddraal. Those who are there are unable to escape, as Gateways will not open in the Black Tower. Most likely there is a Dreamspike in tel’aran’rhiod preventing them.

Aviendha, during her test to become a Wise One, saw a vision of the Aiel’s future. To call it bleak is an understatement; she saw the Aiel defeated and broken by a war with the Seanchan, being reduced to pitiful wretches scavenging for food in garbage piles. She is determined to do something to prevent this, but it is not clear what.

The Seanchan are firmly in control of Altara, Amadicia, and Tarabon. Tuon is now Empress Fortuona, though Seanchan itself is in chaos after Semirhage slaughtered the Imperial family. The Seanchan now have Travelling, as Elaida was captured during their raid on the Tower.

Gawyn is now Egwene’s warder, though still a giant tool.

And finally, a round-up of the surviving Forsaken.

Moridin, a.k.a. Ishamael reborn: Nae’blis, and tied to Rand in some way ever since their streams of Balefire crossed in Shadar Logoth back in *A Crown of Swords*.

Demandred: Alive and well, though what he’s been up to all this time is still a subject for much speculation.

Moghedien: Alive and working directly for Moridin.

Cyndane, a.k.a. Lanfear reborn: Alive and working directly for Moridin.

Graendal: Alive, last seen being punished by Shaidar Haran for her failures.

Some things happen exactly as I remembered, some things are a total surprise. Nynaeve just showed up in Baerlon and I was wondering where the hell she was. I had no memory of she not being in the party at the start of the story. Another surprising detail was that Fain showed up before Perrin did (though Perrin was mentioned first).

The most interesting thing so far from a reread perspective is of course Min's first conversation with Rand. So much foreshadowing.

* ""a wolf, and a broken crown, and trees flowering all around him""
* ""a red eagle, an eye on a balance scale, a dagger with a ruby, a horn, and a laughing face""
* ""A sword that isn't a sword, a golden crown of laurel leaves, a beggar's staff, you pouring water on sand, a bloody hand and a white-hot iron, three women standing over a funeral bier with you on it, black rock wet with blood-""

Matt didn't even lose his eye until the last book and I still don't understand many of them. What is Rand pouring water on sand about? Obviously something to do with the Aiel. That's pretty much the worst thing he could possibly do in their eyes. Possibly publically revealing the secret that only the wise ones and clan leaders are supposed to know?

What other details should I be looking out for on a re-read?

Oh, also funniest moment so far by far is when Min is saying that one of her visions is definitely telling her that her and Rand will meet again and Rand asks her does she see anything about dreams in her vision.

Essentially, are the genetics of the Trolloc race actually connected to the Dark One and the true power, to the metaphysical core, or are they just a particularly savage species that are raised to follow the Dark One?

It's a well-established fact that while the DO touches the world directly and often, the Creator does not. Ever. Except for those couple lines of all-caps text at the end of tEotW and also once (debated) in AMoL. It is also a well-established fact that RJ's favorite concepts to write about is duality.

However, something I noticed throughout the series is that there are not two, but *three* entities to whom are attributed 'supernatural' power (for lack of a better word): The Creator, The Dark One, and The Wheel of Time. I include the Wheel because of the commonly used phrase ""the Wheel weaves as the Wheel wills,"" which seems to give the Wheel its own agenda. 

But why would there even be a third entity at all, when WoT is a story of 2's?

My theory is that there is no Wheel, not really. It's a theological metaphor that mankind devised to describe the way time flows cyclically, but over time it became more than that. We began to attribute more and more apparent autonomy to it, it began to eclipse the image of the Creator as the 'mover and shaker' of the universe. Eventually, the Creator ended up being viewed as nothing more than the source of the One Power, but completley uninterested in helping us along.

If this is true, then all the things attributed to the Wheel, like ta'veren, the Heroes of the Horn, etc. are actually the ways the Creator has tried to help mankind and counter the DO's actions. 

Evidence seems to abound, when you think about it. 

* All the lost Talents reappearing, to better equip the forces of the Light.
* Stronger and stronger channelers coming out of the woodwork to support the Light.
* IIRC, one of the Heroes stated to Mat(?) that they wouldn't have come if a Darkfriend had blown the Horn, only a Lightfriend could summon them.
* Ta'veren seem to be the Creators ace-in-the-hole to counter anything the DO can throw at them, since their power is to 'get what they want,' more or less.

For me there were two main deaths that I am glad didn't happen but I think would have made for better storytelling. 

I think Talmanes should have died in the prologue. It was setting us up for the last battle. You knew people were going to be dying in hundreds of thousands and his death/sacrifice should have set the tone for the book. ""Characters you love are going to die because dammit it's the last battle and heroes die."" Instead he fades to black... and oh good there's an Aes Sedai! In the nick of time hurray... I felt it was a cop out and that Sanderson didn't want to kill someone so early.

The other one is Faile. Don't get me wrong, I loved Faile. I found myself relating well to Perrin throughout the books so when he fell for her so did I. I would have shed some manly tears if she died... and still came close when she was the hurt little falcon. Still. A broken Perrin at the end of the series would have been one of the best scenes in the series. It would have reminded us of all the other characters lost in the battle and that we don't all get happy endings in life.

Anyway. Given the excellent maps available, the substantial quantity of information and the incredible quality of the WoT fanbase, I see no reason why we shouldn't be able to create a sequence of images or some sort of digital model displaying the entirety of tactics used all the way from the meeting at the Field of Merrilor to the march from Braem Wood towards Cairhien to the gateways spitting dragon fire and Mashadar at Thakan'dar. I had a pretty general idea of what was going on while reading without paying too much attention, but I'd *love* to reread the whole thing with a proper depiction of what's happening. A gateway in the sky, so to speak.

It will, of course, require a fairly large chunk of time, something I don't have tons of. I have no intention of hogging the idea, though, so just thought I'd put this out here in case one of you brave souls are ambitious enough to take up a project of this magnitude.

RE: a) 

&gt; And yet, I'd read the ending. We managed to get it into the final book virtually unchanged, with only a few minor tweaks here and there. The sequence (it is more than one scene) that I am referring to most of the time when I talk about this encompasses the entire epilogue of A Memory of Light. Once you get there, you can know you're reading Robert Jordan's words, though of course there are other scenes scattered through the book that he worked on too.

Taken straight from Sanderson's blog. That epilogue was all Jordan. Don't like it? Tough titties. It may not be the ending you wanted, but it's *an* ending. The ending Jordan envisioned so long ago. Of course with Jordan not being here anymore, there was no way to go in and fix things that may have been a bit wonky between books, no way to fill plot holes that were left open by merely having notes and not Jordan himself.

i'm not trying to say ""don't complain, don't discuss"", i'm merely stating the fact that a lot of the things that you are blaming on Sanderson, or even on ""Team Jordan"", are not really their fault. You can't just fill in the missing pieces as an entirely different author without potentially changing something that the original author may have wanted. You can't possibly know.

RE: b)

&gt;Question: Any news on the Wheel of Time Encyclopedia?
&gt;
&gt;Answer: Harriet was asked about this at our signing, and she said that it was well on its way. This is not simply an update of the Guide released way back when, but is a comprehensive encyclopedia. It will contain art, and it will include things from Robert Jordan's notes that didn't make it into the series. (Note that the Waygate Foundation, a charity organization, is running a charity drive tied to the Encyclopedia right now.)
&gt;
&gt;Question: What about the outriggers? (The sequel trilogy to the Wheel of Time series that Robert Jordan had planned to write.)
&gt;
&gt;Answer: It's not going to happen. Harriet and I are both firm on this. Robert Jordan wouldn't have wanted it to happen. He said that he wanted the series to be finished, but he did not want anything more. (He was even uncomfortable with the idea of someone like myself finishing the series.)
&gt;
&gt;Beyond this, at the Q&amp;A on Monday, Harriet revealed something I previously haven't been able to tell you but that I've known for quite some time—that Robert Jordan didn't leave much of anything in the way of notes for the Outriggers. There are, quite literally, only two sentences of explanation from RJ telling us what the plot of the outriggers was to be about.
&gt;
&gt;So no, no outriggers. I highly doubt you will see the prequels either, and for similar reasons. All good things must come to an ending. And this is ours.

Again, taken from the same blogpost. No outriggers. No prequels. The encyclopedia is being remade into an even bigger amazing thing, with all kinds of Jordan notes etc. flooded into them.

i know you all have waited a very long time for this. i have too. And i know some of you are so frustrated about how things turned out. But this is it. This is what we have. Make the best of it, because we can't get anything else. ./rant

1350825997.0,34,self.WoT,11ucgp,"Dear Brandon Sanderson &amp; Harriet Rigney - Thoughts from a Loyal eReader Fan on Waiting for ""A Memory of Light""",65,31,72,http://www.reddit.com/r/WoT/comments/11ucgp/dear_brandon_sanderson_harriet_rigney_thoughts/,"About six months after the iPad was released, I finally got the money held back to buy one. I was elated. I'd been dragging my huge paperbacks to work with me back and forth, and with this shiny new gadget, doing one of my favorite things, reading, on my lunches at work would be a lot easier. Not to mention, the threat of getting food on the pages and ruining my book was eliminated. If I got something on the screen, that's why it has a screen protector. I immediately finished the book I was on, and began my first ebook. I started buying ebooks on iTunes like a madman, and stumbled on ""The Wheel of Time"". I'd always been curious, so I bought ""The Eye of the World"" and began reading it. That was about 2-years ago. Since then, I've bought, from iTunes mind you, I've never once pirated an ebook, the rest of the series, and have been doing my first read through non-stop. I'm just starting the gathering storm, and was figuring about 4 books ago that I'd be done with ""Towers of Midnight"" right around January when the final book to this amazing series would be completed. Then I read that the hardback would be out in January, but all of us ebook people would have to wait [until April, 9th 2013 to be exact](http://www.tor.com/blogs/2012/03/a-memory-of-light-ebook-release-date-confirmed).

It's more than a little disappointing to me. The only reason I can think of for a delay in e-release is a fear of piracy and/or someone leaking the book. It's an understandable fear, but it also undermines a lot of people like me. People who aren't going to pirate the books, people who, even though we use a digital device, still will not cheat an artist of his dues. And so, presumably, I am made to wait, just as all of the others like me (and I know a few of them) are being made to wait.

So what does this wait accomplish? For you, possibly a sense of security, hopes that the story that's taken 20-years to complete will not be spoiled by some idiot leaking the book before the hardback comes out. But for us, your still loyal, but just a little different fans? We get to wait, while our friends who aren't e-reader people enjoy the end of one of their favorite series. Oh sure, I could buy the hardback and have instant gratification, I know. But when you're like me, and you've purchased all the books in one format, it seems ridiculous to have that one lone hardback hanging out, doesn't it?

And so, I will wait. I will not pirate the book, I'll just wait. I'll not monitor this reddit, nor visit dragonmount.com, or any of the other WoT sites that I've come to enjoy. And I'll do it so that the fans who buy your hardback, don't spoil it for **me**, the fan who dared not buy the hardbacks, just because he didn't want to drag a huge book back and forth to work to see it ruined in the lunch room. I'd say I'm the only ebook guy out there, but if that were true, I don't think Amazon would sell so many Kindles, nor would Barnes &amp; Noble sell so many Nooks. And I'm pretty sure Apple would have long since eliminated the iBookstore, if it was just me.

I know that Sanderson sometimes pops up around here, and hopefully he see this. I'm not after an explanation, I'll simply ""live with what I cannot change"", like Moiraine would say. But I wouldn't have used that quote without that evil little e-reader, would I?

EDIT: Spelling.

EDIT (10/26/12): To all those out there suggesting piracy as a solution to my above whining; that's not a solution. Piracy is going to make matters like above worse, and really, it's why publishers have this policy. I'm not out for a freebie, I just want the book when everyone else gets it. I'd say this with any authors work where it was the same situation. I realize that there's nothing I can do about it now, I just wish publishers would realize there's a HUGE market out there that they alienate with all this crap. I know Sanderson can't do anything about it, and I appreciate Harriet Rigney's angle, but if we let them know that there's a market out there, it may find it's way to the publishers.

1370612381.0,32,self.WoT,1fuzif,I have a new theory about Tuons actions in AMOL (spoilers all),39,7,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/WoT/comments/1fuzif/i_have_a_new_theory_about_tuons_actions_in_amol/,"I have a theory about Tuons actions that I had been mixing around in my head, but I hadnt put it into words until right now: I have in fact copied an pasted my comment from a different thread but I feel like it could stand on its own for discussion:


Tuon is not stupid. She is in fact written as one of the shrewdest characters in Randland. She is also extremely superstitious. But never stupid. We see her as either being apparently naive to the fact that suldam can channel or stubbornly refusing to admit it. When she later admits it she still maintains a ridiculous argument that suldam choose not to be 'animals' or whatever. I think she has reasons for this:


She is raised as an empress, someone for whom personal suffering of one individual (or Damane) is not as important as the well being of the empire. The empire is her primary concern, all other things come second. Throughout the series Tuon is almost fanatically determined that Damane are right and true, that what is done to these women is for the greater good. That it is what is right for them, that they are dangerous running free, that they want to be Damane.


I have stated elsewhere that the damane are the perfect parable for black slavery in America and the perpetrators of those cruelties. The justifications given by Seanchan and Slave Owners were similar in the way they dehumanise their victims:


""They want to be slaves

The economy will go to ruin if they are freed

Its better for them than running around causing trouble

They're not real people, they need to be trained""


I don't see Tuon easily turning her back on thousands of years of this kind of sick reasoning, even if she is finally convinced its false. Here's what she would be most afraid of: complete collapse of the empire. For years people have looked to the throne as authority over an empire that is founded on Damane. The rebellion that she has to worry about back home during the last battle is about succession to the throne, but she knows that would be nothing compared to the chaos of an empire admitting to the lie that is the basis of its foundation. She genuinely fears the end of the crystal throne, and so will never change her official position on Damane.


So the attempted ending of compulsory Damane would be chaos as I see it (perhaps you could compare it to the American civil war? the final outcome has been good for society but the chaos and destruction it caused severely damaged America) Then there's her confrontation with Egwene, who unexpectedly throws her another option. The gradual change of Damane into volunteers over years and years may be a better alternative. MAYBE EVEN OVER HUNDREDS OF YEARS


I doubt Egwene intended this as an option, she was probably trying to stave off invasion at a later date. As I have said, Tuon isnt dumb. She knows the truth about Damane is spreading and will eventually spread back to her own Empire. It's a problem she will have to face eventually. She now sets in motion something that may change Damane from unwilling slaves to volunteers: positions of honour in the Empire, and for the Seanchan positions of honour seem to be all they give a shit about anyway. Even Tuon is smart enough to see this a better alternative for her empire, which is why she shocked the crowd and agreed to such outrageous conditions with Egwene.


So in summation: I think Tuon secretly wants the deal with Egwene, more to save her Empire from complete destruction. Perhaps Rands warning broke through to her. If she goes down this path with Egwene... How can people claim the Damane are slaves of Suldam who can also channel if they are proven to be volunteers? It may take time. She will gradually change the Damane into a volunteer society, possibly one day freeing the unwilling, possibly one day having the suldam learn to channel. What initially reads a clever win for Egwene can also be seen a very clever scheme of Tuons

Rand's final battle with the dark one and the epilogue.  Put those parts together and this is what feels like the real final book to me.  A short novella spinning together a conclusion that the entire series laboured to bring into motion; the growth of Rand, the Dragon, and how all of the events of the series influenced him and helped him finally overcome the last battle with the Dark One.

The rest of the book, the massive battle, the multitude of character deaths...these felt like the *epilogue* to the entire series.  An account of the fates of the characters after the main plot had been concluded.  Maybe this is just a coping mechanism brought forth by the grief of a multitude of character deaths and hardship that the people I'd grown to love went through, but I think I'll always remember them as they were up until the final book.

Does this sort of resonate with anyone else?  When I think about the state of the final book and what it portrayed, it just seems to make more sense to me when I think about it this way.

With the impending arrival of the final installment of The Wheel of Time series, we ask that you all refrain from discussing **any part** of the book outside of the designated discussion threads. This is to make sure that nothing is inadvertently spoiled for anyone else who happens to go into a thread about another book and see a discussion about AMoL. We've looked over the options, and we find this to be the easiest way to keep everyone happy and still facilitate discussion about the final book. That being said...

***Please browse the subreddit and all posts with caution!***

Ok, now lets talk about chapter discussion threads. We've decided that  a discussion thread will be created once everyday that will span the length of 5 chapters. We've also decided that there will be *no spoiler tags* to be used in these threads, so read them at your own discretion!

Finally, some of you are probably looking for a place to catch up on the series without re-reading all of the books. I'll list a few resources down here for you to use:

* [Encyclopaedia WoT](http://www.encyclopaedia-wot.org/) is  a great resource. It has a chapter-by-chapter breakdown of each released book giving you the POVs for the chapter and a lengthy synopsis of what happened. It also contains footnotes at the end of each summary linking certain hints dropped by Jordan or anecdotes about characters to every other released book in the series. Very lengthy, but very thorough.

* [/u/MikeofThePalace 's Brief Late Series Summary](http://www.reddit.com/r/WoT/comments/15wj9g/prememory_of_light_summary_spoilers_through_the/) is a quick breakdown of all of the critical information that's happened in the later books in the series. I recommend reading it if you just got finished with a series re-read recently for a quick refresher. Very brief, but not very thorough.

* [Dragonmount](http://www.dragonmount.com/) is the fansite for The Wheel of Time. If you want any resources on the current books, theory discussions, or links to other sites I haven't mentioned, you'll find them here. 

I hope everyone is as excited as we are for the A Memory of Light! Please make sure to be conscious of what you post and where you post it throughout this time so that everyone has a great reading experience!

I don't want to gripe about anything, because I don't think the book deserves people nit picking about tiny details. I would to mention a few things though.


It was only about halfway through The Last Battle (that huge chapter) that I started becoming depressed with all the deaths. More specifically, with Bela's death. It's ridiculous, I know, but she's been through the whole series, and although I think she was more of a joke than an actual character, I was still saddened when she died. Then it just went downhill from there. I know the battle was more realistic when so many people died, but I was still kind of hoping for a typical happy ending. That said, I think it was happier than expected, since almost all of the main characters survived. Throughout the whole series I was hoping there was a loophole that would get Rand out of dying at the end, but I wasn't actually expecting him to survive in some form.

So yeah, just some of my thoughts. I think what saddens me the most is knowing that Robert Jordan can't continue with any more books in the same world, and that Brandon Sanderson will not either. I never wanted the series to end, even if it meant adding ten more books.

    A co-worker recommended this series to me when I was in the final stages of preparing for my marriage, and the timing was really ideal.  It gave me something of an escape from the stress of the preparations, and I quickly became committed to attacking the entire series.  As it turns out, I blew through it at a pace that startled my coworkers (my brain is weird, sue me) and now I'm stuck with the rest of you jerks, waiting for the last book to come out.  I think that's a good thing, actually - I get a tiny taste of what you've experienced in the last two decades.  To that end:


1.  Do you feel that the WoT experience is diluted in a quick read like that?  I've got pretty high retention, but I can only think of the depths I might've dug into had I had years between books.
2.  Do you feel the WoT experience can be improved by an experience like that?  Lets be honest - 5-10 have a lot of problems.  I'm not saying there isn't good material in every book, but the sprawl of the story and the tectonic pacing are rough to deal with, and I can only imagine the agony if you had waited two years for, say, Path of Daggers.  
3.  Are there supplemental materials I should throw myself at?  I've read the prologue to AMoL, but I haven't tried New Dawn - the reviews seemed pretty mediocre.  

As far as actual story questions, I've got a  few but I'm curious if there are any passages in particular that you find are ""key"" to the whole story.

(The Dragon Reborn, Chapter 24)

""It is the morning after TDR, Ch20. Mat wakes and servants bring him another huge meal. His goal is still to escape, so instead of getting back into bed, he gets dressed and goes out to the White Tower grounds. He still wants to say goodbye to Egwene, Nynaeve and Elayne before he leaves. He asks till he finds a bridge guard and sure enough the man recognizes him. As he walks along he sees Else Grinwell and tries to talk to her. She avoids his touch, coolly asks what he is doing out of bed, and hurries on. Hearing the clacking of swords, he walks to the Warder training yard and watches the students practice. He recognizes Galad and Gawyn from Elayne's descriptions. They recognize him from Egwene's descriptions and talk with him during a break. Gawyn asks Mat about Rand. Their talk develops into a wager, Mat with a quarterstaff against both of them with their practice swords. Their trainer, Hammar, watches closely. Mat thumps both of them but nearly faints from hunger during the fight. After the fight, Hammar announces that Jearom, the greatest swordsman ever, only lost once, to a farmer with a quarterstaff. Gawyn is impressed with Mat's skill, but Mat tells him that his father, Abell, is the best and Rand's father, Tam, is not far behind. When Hammar talks with Mat, Mat slips and speaks in the Old Tongue, then says he is from Manetheren. Confused and hungry, Mat heads back to the White Tower. But he keeps the quarterstaff.""

Technically, I am not done as I am about 40% through New Spring - but, I feel that I have in fact completed the story. I am enjoying New Spring for it's history of the journey I've been on.

I just wanted to tell someone that I am finished with it, (and I can finally start to really research certain topics without the fear of being spoiled.) One thing I have always wanted to read more about, though, is The Age of Legends and Lews Therin Telamon's individual story and adventures. The prologue of the first book is what initially drew me into reading and finishing the series.

Well, I guess that's all I really have to say for now. The Wheel of Time got me back into reading, has been basically a meditation, and has really sparked my imagination again. Thanks for listening. :)

Some are just thoughts without a question, some are questions. 

I welcome feedback on my thoughts, and answers to my questions!

* Who was the Tinker at the Darkfriend Social?

* Who was Setalle Anan? Was she the one who tested the Dream Ter'angreal that wrote the notes Verin gave to Egwene?

* When did Ishamael/Moridin begin inducting Taim?

* Rand is almost Moiraine's nephew. Her brother Taringail Damodred was Tigraine's first husband, but Rand was the son of Tigraine and an Aielman. Still, through marriage - theres a tie. Neat.

* Rand has a direct blood tie to Elayne through Tigraine. Haha...it's distant enough to not matter though.

* What the FUCK do the Dice in Mat's head represent!?!?! I can't figure this out! I mean, obviously they act as a sort of spidey sense but what do they actually do/mean?

* Would Perrin have still married Faile if she had kept the name Mandarb? Probably...

* Theory: The reason that physically entering Tel'aran'rhiod is evil is because it dulls empathy. Those light-side characters who enter TAR in the flesh (Rand, Perrin, Egwene) all seem to lose the ability to empathize or understand another's perspective. This is (a small part of) what lead to Egwene becoming Amyrlin, Rand's hard-on to be cuendillar, and Perrin seemed to temporarily lose it after fighting Slayer in the flesh in AMOL. Each one was able to overcome this by the way Hopper taught Perrin to not exist too fully in the Dream. Perrin focused on Faile, of course. Rand snapped out of it (among much else) when he almost killed Tam. Egwene snapped out of it after bonding Gawyn. 

* Bella is a Hero of the Horn.

* Elayne's children are going to be Heroes of the Horn. Either one is Gaidal(though I think it more likely Grady's ugly ass kid is Gaidal), or imo more likely they are Shiva and Kali (I forget the WOT names given to these two but they were both mentioned and would be appropriate together given their specific backgrounds)

* Min is barren. :(

* If Bayle Doman had followed through with his oath to dump the Domination Band into the ocean, Rand would have lost the last battle.

* A lot of Ishamael's philosophical conjecture in the first few books turn out ironically prophetic in the end.

* What was going on on the Continent of Madness this whole time? I'm guessing that's where Perrin jumped to when fleeing Slayer.

* I forget who went, but one of the Aiel Wise Ones returned to Rhuidean to go through the columns again - as Aviendha did. She told Aviendha to change the name of one of her children and not tell anyone - and to see if that changed what she saw. Was it revealed whether that changed things or not?

* Who else could Jain have been? All of the Heroes (and even the Forsaken) have names derived from famous characters. Graendel is properly transformed into the visage fitting the story of Grendel, Paedrig -&gt; St. Patrick, Artur Hawkwing -&gt; Stephen Hawking(lol jk King Arthur), Amerasu -&gt; Amaterasu, so on and so forth. For that matter, what about Birgitte and Gaidal Cain? Could Farstrider be Neil Armstrong? Noal -&gt; Neil isn't a big leap.

When Moiraine and company are escaping from Baerlon, Moiraine intimidates the White Cloak soldiers by making herself appear as a giant. This isn't strange - seems totally doable knowing what we do about the one power. However, she then *steps over the 20ft. wall*. 

How did she do that? The power should have only given the illusion of height, not make her actually grow. I believe it's stated somewhere in another book (can't remember which) that women cannot pick themselves up with the power, anymore than they could pick themselves up with their own physical strength.

At the same time, lots of ter’angreal seem to have been pretty mundane objects. Demandred at one point is dismissive of some of the dream ter’angreal as “minor ter’angreal used for training students.” Aviendha identifies a good number from the Ebou Dar cache as being, essentially, cell phones.


Now, maybe this is just the engineer in me talking, but who the hell designs these things in such a way that an innocuous activity like, say, channeling nearby, could have such devastating consequences? I recognize that some of these more touchy ter’angreal could be the AoL equivalent of industrial machinery, but still. A distillation column won’t explode if you whistle near it, and a rototiller won’t slice you in half if you put gasoline in it instead of diesel. Safety is important, and they never seem to have even thought to put a warning label on any of these things.

When I typed this up I was having a conversation with /u/JagYui about our theories on what the significance of the pipe is and here is what I came up with and i'm fairly confident in it. In the conversation Brandon Sanderson's Mistborn Trilogy came up by JagYui and a comparison between the creator and the dark one.


The forces in the *Mistborn* Trilogy and WoT are very similar. However, I feel that we are looking at it from the wrong angle. What if the Creator, obviously on a greater plan of existence than the humans, wanted to make a source of life and that's what the wheel is. When the wheel was created Newton's third law took place and upon the creation of the life he inadvertently created destruction(The Dark One). 


Since the wheel is the power of creation/life and the dark one is the power of destruction/death this explains why The Dark One's touch on the pattern is strictly destruction(Which was obvious because he was always refereed to as a source of destruction and evil). 


When Rand was taken into The Dark One's plain (Is that the right way to describe it?) and they were both weaving the pattern to their will it would be safe to assume that this is very much like Vin in *MistBorn* when she embodies preservation. She was only capable of preserving while Rand was only capable of changing the sequence of lives by changing the flows of the one power flowing in the pattern. 


As he was controlling these flows of the power Rand reached a level of Nirvana that no other Aes Sedai has ever reached before because he** knew** that not only did the One Power turn the wheel but was the basis for which everything existed. This is observed when Rand goes to Rhuidan and witnesses the ogiers and channelers all Singing together to create  an Ogier Grove. Leading me to believe that in the Age of Legends there was an obvious greater understanding of the nature of the One Power and its interaction with the wheel, also observable with the the ability to affect the weather. Since Rand had reached this level of understanding he knew that when he was channeling he was not bringing in the power from an outside source but was instead changing the power that was already present around him. Meaning, when he thought of his pipe lit he also understood that instead of taking hold of Saidin and forcing it to light it was possible to, as in Tel'aran'rhiod, believe the pipe was lit and it would be.  


As I was proof reading this I thought of another point, if Tel'aran'rhiod is the meeting point of all the possible worlds on the pattern and the real world is just the world with the highest probability then it's safe to assume just like in Tel'aran'rhiod if some one were to believe something to be absolutely true they could make it so.(This one can definitely use some work)

So I'll admit, despite being a grown man, I still have daydreams about if I some day was in RandLand (as I've seen it called on /r/WoT ) and was able to talk to all the main characters.  My first thought, however stupid, is that I'd feel like a badass if I entered in the middle of the series and was able to know so much info about the characters that I just blew them away.  But then the next logical step would be that Rand, Moraine, and probably Cadsuane (depending on timeline of where you entered) would all likely be very curious as to what happens and such.   BUT by telling them some of the things, like.... some of the major things that happen that weren't intentioned, and they managed to be avoided, would you throw off the entire pattern?  Would you yourself be a thread in the pattern?  Been thinking about this a lot, could you even talk to them and help the characters?  

So I suppose to put it in a reasonable question form:  If you found yourself in the WoT universe, would you help the characters out by revealing some/all of your knowledge regarding the books?  What steps/precautions would you take and what would you consider to be important to tell/withhold?",,False,self,t5_2rdg1,False,,,True,t3_1av1ag,http://www.reddit.com/r/WoT/comments/1av1ag/if_you_found_yourself_in_the_wot_universe_would/,

EDIT: Ok, everyone, me and my friend have settled the matter. Superman is as weak to magic as a normal human [As seen here] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powers_and_abilities_of_Superman#Weaknesses)
I think we can all agree, Rand uses magic.


Rand can set wards that can kill whoever enter it, normally these wards can be defeated, detected or otherwise dealt with. But in the issue of superman being just as vulnerable a normal Human would mean he would die if he entered one. Superman wouldn't know much about Rand or anything about magic so he wouldn't know quite how to deal with him (Correct me if I am wrong). I'm going to guess that the moment Rand sees someone FLYING AT HIM, he will set wards immediately, or take any other precautions he might need to, after all, flying was an age of legends thing, so only the forsaken would have access to it.

Now if they both knew about each other and all of their abilities, eh, I think it would be a mexican standoff, Rand feeding various wards to keep superman at bay or disperse heat/Macguffin vision with the One Power, Superman waiting for Rand to lower his guard. So they just stand there, until either Rand or Superman makes a move. However Rand can attack without moving, Superman really can't. So I would guess that he would fire off various small attacks at Superman, while maintaining his wards. Hell, Rand could cloud the sky to keep superman powered down.

So my money is on the man who can attack with nearly all of his power without moving a muscle.

She's one of my favorite Aes Sedai out of the series, and I was thrilled to death back whilst reading Knife Of Dreams and discovering she was still alive.

But, the more I think about it, her remaining alive ended up being one of the things I was most dissatisfied with the series doing. The way she went out in Fires Of Heaven, saving the Dragon by sacrificing herself and taking out a powerful Forsaken in the process was amazing. Her memory hanging over Rand afterwards, the death of one of his most trusted advisers created a kind of poignant and powerful emotional beauty over subsequent actions. Coupled with reading New Spring, it makes you grieve for what is lost and it carries an immense weight to it. And, if that had been the last we saw of her, she would have remained in my top 5 favorite characters.

But, clearly after the letter in Knife Of Dreams, this is not the case. Her return is a mire of wasted potential. She comes into Rand's tent at Merrilor being badass and quoting the Karaethon Cycle. After that, not really much of anything. She just more or less became a silent angreal of Saidar for Rand to use. After how integral she was earlier in the story it seemed like she was relegated to a painfully minor role upon her return.

I know, there's the logistical problem of Min's viewing of her not coming true if she had been killed going through the doorway.

I've seen a number of people disappointed with the Gawyn, Padan Fain, etc story lines that were cut off so abruptly.

Just because a character traveled far and struggled did not mean they would succeed.  The fact that characters could fail; in a lot of ways made the successes more meaningful.

I particularly liked how some of the prophecies were not what we thought they'd be.  Like how Aliva ""helps"" Rand die.  After 14 books it was nice to be caught off guard.  I was happy that the ending wasn't a story book ending.  That Rand realized good only really exists if it's by choice.

The whole thing between Faile (sp?) Perrin, and Aiel makes me want to jump in the book and slaughter them all.

In mine Rand travels around the world with Min having adventures and impressing everybody by being very mysterious and knowing.

Of course they probably have some sort of system set up so that they can visit Elayne and Avhienda and Rand's kids. When Elayne and Avhienda turn 100 they retire and spend the rest of their lives traveling with Rand. Also in my vision Min gets to live for a very long time too because of her vision power (I know this is not intended by Jordan but it's my headcanon so who cares)

Mat travels back to Seanchan with Tuon and together they reconquer it in a very spectacular way. Tuon eventually agrees to phase out the damane after finally seeing some logic.

Perrin lives the quiet happy life with Faile he always wanted. He trains his kids as blacksmiths even though they don't need to be.

Lan and Nynaeve bring back Malkieri and rule it until Lan dies and Nynaeve decides to focus on being a healer and let their son/daughter rule.

I have been theorizing for a long time about a few geographic issues I have had with the Wheel of Time series. I have been a fan of medieval fantasy and sword and sorcery for quite some time, and the cartographic and geographic elements of those stories have been some of my favourite topics. As such, I have noticed an issue I would like to clear up, i.e. what is the size of the land that the Wheel of Time takes place? This area, known as the ""Westlands"" by some, and by ""Randland"" by others, or by many other names, is defined for the remainder of this article as the land between the Spine of the World and the Aryth Ocean, and the land between the Mountains of Dhoom the Sea of Storms. I will refer to this area as the ""Westlands"" here out. When describing distances, I will be using miles. When referring to ""Distance North/South"", I refer to the distance (in miles) from The Sea of Storms south of Illian to the base of the Mountains of Dhoom. When referring to ""Distance East/West"" (in miles), I refer to the distance between the center of Kinslayer's Dagger, to Bandar Eban. My theory is that current ideas and measurements listed by various sources are inaccurate, and the measurements of the Westlands as depicted in the two most reliable sources available ""The World of Robert Jordan's The Wheel of Time"" and ""New Spring"", can not be taken as fact. I will also propose my own system of measurement for the size of the Westlands. 

The first text under my scrutiny is ""The World of Robert Jordan's The Wheel of Time"" which is often seen as accurate, though it has had noted flaws and cannot be seen as purely canon, for it is not written by Robert Jordan himself. To quote the Wheel of Time Wiki, the text is: ""considered broadly canonical and Robert Jordan provided substantial amounts of never-before-seen information for it"". However, it should be noted that: ""Jordan's intent was for the book to have been written by a historian of Rand al'Thor's time (albeit an extremely well-informed one) and he wished to ensure that the book would be prone to some of the problems of bias and guesswork that afflict 'real' history as well"". In this sense, anything that is not expressly stated within Jordan's novels themselves or expressly approved by Robert Jordan himself cannot be taken as fact. However, in the prequel New Spring which is written by Robert Jordan, measurements that are more direct and distinct are given concerning the Westlands. “A reliable way of measuring the maps was produced in the novel New Spring, which gave the straight-line distance from Tar Valon to the sea south of Tear as 400 leagues (1,600 miles). Other distances in the novels include 600 miles for Cairhien to Caemlyn, 100 miles for Emond's Field to Baerlon, 900 from Tear to Aringill, 800 miles for the length of coastline between Ebou Dar and Illian and 1,500 miles for Cairhien to southern Ghealdan (although another distance is given of 500 leages - 2,000 miles - for Kinslayer's Dagger to northern Amadicia).

These measurements, when marked on a straight-edge and then applied to the entirety of the Westlands, provides a very simple measurement, which is confirmed by TWoRJWoT. This measurement, which I will refer to from here on out as “Classic Dimension”, lists the height of the Westlands as approximately 2000 miles, and the distance North/South as approximately 3000 miles. Typically, I would be satisfied with such a measurement, but evidence suggests to me that these measurements are incorrect. These measurements have the Westlands physically around the size of the United States. This in itself is not disconcerting; however, taking into account the Aiel Waste and Shara to the East, along with an unidentifiably long stretch of Blight to the North, the world of the Wheel of Time quickly seems to be on a supercontinent larger then Eurasia. This, once more, is not necessarily a problem, but does present itself as such when we look at the climate of the Wheel of Time. If we look at the Two Rivers, which has snow in the winter, we realize it is only about one thousand miles north of the Sea of Storms, using Classic Dimension. Strangely, locations that far south were described as “never having seen snow” by Rand al’Thor and other characters. While this is not impossible (Areas in Europe or America see snow during the winter while locations only a thousand miles south may never see snow), it becomes confusing when looking north of those locations. Geographically, if the Two Rivers is colder than the Sea of Storms, then the Westlands must be located in the Northern Hemisphere of a planet. This means that locations more North of the Two Rivers must be colder than that location, which means that places such as Shienar should logically be covered in snow almost all year (it lies an additional thousand miles north of the Two Rivers in latitude). This is not the case.

There are only two logical possibilities that could explain such a climactic phenomenon, besides a simple “magic” solution. The first, and the less likely, is that the Westlands is located on a planet considerably larger than ours, while also having the correct atmosphere, rotation, tilt, and distance from its sun to have similar climate patterns as ours. The second and considerably more likely option and the one I will sustain for the rest of this document, and try to defend, is the idea that a “mile” in the Wheel of Time is not equal to an Earth “mile”. Additionally, other smaller, though more direct, pieces of evidence seem to claim that the Westlands are smaller than The World of, and it comes from New Spring, and Lord of Chaos.

Firstly, we can revisit the measurements given within New Spring. In all of the measurements given, except two, the rough size of the Westlands can be estimated as being 3500 miles East/West, and 2000 miles North/South, except in two measurements: The distance from Tear to Aringall, as put forth by New Spring, is 900 miles, which would mean that the Westlands East/West distance is a massive 4800 miles, and it’s size Noth/South is 2700 miles. This is a considerably large difference in size from the previous series of measurements, and normally would be thrown out as simple error by the person providing the measurement. This is the exact thing my theory needs. If it is possible even within New Spring, that measurements can be wrong, then all measurements in the actual texts cannot be seen as purely canonical. We must then decide which the most accurate measurement is provided, and use it. The second measurement in this list that is different from the others is the most interesting to me, it is the statement the distance from Emond’s Field to Baerlon is 100 miles. When worked out, this makes the East/West size of the Westlands only 2000 miles, and the North/South distance 1300 miles. I am inclined to use this measurement, for it provides a more sufficient system when taking climate into account, but also because the distance from Emond’s Field to Baerlon is the smallest physical distance measured in New Spring, which means, logically, it may be the most accurate due to the nations limited technology. I understand that these ideas do not a proven theory get; however, it provides a basis for my challenge, and my upcoming question. When looking at Lord of Chaos, the sixth book in the series, and the most canon of all the texts discussed within this article, something very helpful comes up.

Matrim Cauthon states when moving his armies from camp to assault the Forsaken in Illian, that it would take “more than a month” to travel from Maerone to Tear. Mat also states that he wanted to travel 35 miles a day. This is a basis we can use to judge difference, if we use a month as 30 days, and then calculate basic walking speed.

The normal walking speed of an adult human is 3.2 miles per hour, though Mat was moving on horseback, which will be addressed. If we assume that travels every day, and only rests to allow 8 hours of sleep for the men (the biological need), and don’t worry about rests, et cetera, then we can find a simple calculation to see how fast he travels. 35 miles a day over 16 hours of travel means that Mat is moving 2.1 mph, a bit slower than walking speed. If Mat moves from sunup to sundown (12 hours), then Mat is moving 3 mph, which is much more realistic. Maerone is stated to be directly across the river from Aringill, which now provides the biggest argument. If Mat completes the trip from Maerone to Tear in only 30 days (though he says it will take more than a month), at 35 miles a day, the distance from Maerone to Tear is 1050 miles. This is a 100+ mile difference from the Aringill to Tear estimate which made the country way too large, and is also only assumed if the trip takes 30 days. Assuming (more than a month) means a month and a half (50 days), the distance is 1750 miles, which would make the North/South distance of the Westlands over 3000 miles, and the East/West distance considerably larger.

So, by Mats measurements, the Westlands is a considerably larger continent than any of the measurements in New Spring, which makes the Westlands simply impossible as far as climate is concerned, and would make the Aiel Waste and Shara, tacked onto the Westlands most likely the width of an entire planet.

The only logical explanation I can see for this is that a mile in the Wheel of Time is not equal to a mile in Earth. I recommend those reading this to find their own measurements and examples, and help decide exactly how large the Westlands are.

EDIT: Additions from comments.

 I cede that rand feet and earth feet are the same, and a rand mile equals 6000 feet, making a rand mile 1.6 earth miles. Additionally, a rand month is 28 days.

*Saidar* is frequently described as a river, an almost unstoppable force that can't be forced to go where you want, only once you've surrendered to it can you guide it. *Saidin* conversely is a torrent, a force to be wrestled with and made to comply, it's a fight to the death.

The rather long-winded question I'm trying to get to is ""what's the source of these different conceptualizations of the Source?"".

The reason I'm asking is that I can kind of see where the conceptualization of *saidin* comes from. Now this is highly anecdotal and personal experience but I'll throw it out there, see if it sticks. The feeling that I associate with *saidin* is the feeling of fighting for your life, that exhilarating feeling of being right at the edge. It's said in the series that you feel ""more alive"" when you hold the Source and again I agree. Both during the high intensity stress training on my Krav Maga class and exercises when I had my brief tangle with the military (you don't really care about the fact that people are firing blanks, it's still scary when you get shot at) I get just that feeling, that feeling of being ""more alive"" than usual.

I don't know if this is intentional or coincidence but there it is. I also wonder if there's a similar connection for *saidar*.

TL;DR: Where do the different descriptions of holding *saidin*/*saidar* come from? Also a lot of personal conjecture.

So I was thinking about this one this week and began to wonder.. what if this prophecy had 2 interpretations? We know Rand used it himself with regards to putting the sword back in the Stone of Tear to keep the nobles there in line and following his orders, but what if it had a second meaning?

""Into the heart he thrusts his sword"" -- Could this be the mountain of Shaul Ghul? Into the heart of the Dark One.

""Into the heart, to hold their hearts"" -- Into the very heart of the mountain, where the Dark One is, to hold the hearts of men (ie. their destiny/survival).

Who draws it out shall follow after -- Obviously, who draws the sword out of the heart... draw, meaning to wield or use. In this case, Elan using the sword to seize the True Power. He obviously ""followed after"" the Dragon. Indicating what (or who) was to come out of the mountain.

""What hand can grasp that fearful blade?"" -- Pretty obvious line here. Who would be willing to grasp the blade that goes to the True Power? 


All together, while the Stone of Tear reference to the prophecy still holds fairly accurately, I think Jordan may have had a subtle dig going to Rand's survival post-Last Battle.

1. **Aginor** - Killed by burning himself out with the power while fighting Rand - *Grade: F* 
1. **Balthamel** - Killed by Someshta, the Green Man before he can do anything of note. - *Grade: F* 
1. **Be'lal** - Became a High Lord of Tear, but allowed himself to be killed by Moraine before accomplishing anything - *Grade: D* 
1. **Ishamael** - Thought he was the dark one, caused the Trolloc Wars and the death of Artur Hawking, tormented Rand but was defeated by him before accomplishing anything. - *Grade: C* 
1. **Lanfear** - Tries to seduce Rand into joining her, does nothing of note. Killed by the Dark One for her failures after being stuck in Sindhol with Moiraine - *Grade: F* 
1. **Rahvin** - Takes control of Andor, but enrages Rand and gets taken out like a bitch. - *Grade: D+* 
1. **Asmodean** - Severed from the Shadow after failing to take the Cheodan Kal from Rand. Teaches him how to Channel. - *Grade: F* 
1. **Sammael** - Becomes a Lord of Illian and takes control of the government there. Raises a large army and is quite a pain in the ass. Ultimately goes down to Mashadar in Shadar Logoth. - *Grade: C+* 
1. **Osan'gar** - Aginor reincarnated, infiltrates the Black Tower as Corlan Dashiva. Attempts to assassinate Rand before being killed during the cleansing of Saidin. - *Grade: F* 
1. **Aran'gar** - Bathamel reincarnated, she takes the name Halima. Tries to disrupt the rebel Aes Sedai, but is ultimately outed and killed when Rand balefires Natrin's Barrow - *Grade: F* 
1. **Mesaana** - Orchestrates the split in the tower, but her mind is broken in a confrontation with Egwene in Ter'aran'rhiod. - *Grade: C+* 
1. **Semhirage** - Takes a place as the Truthspeaker for the Daughter of the Nine Moons. Assasinates the Seanchan Empress. Comes very close to capturing Rand so that he can be turned to the Shadow. Killed when Rand uses the True Power to escape the male A'dam. - *Grade: A* 
1. **Graendal** - Destabilizes Arad Doman, but her plots cause several of the other Forsaken to be killed, before the Dark One kills her for her failures. - *Grade: F* 
1. **M'Hael** - Creates a new generation of Dreadlords at the Black Tower, is raised to the ranks of the Chosen by the Dark One. Killed in an epic battle with Egwene - *Grade: B* 
1. **Cyndane** - Lanfear ressurected. She attempts to turn Rand one last time, before making her own plans to seize Callandor and Rand while he is battling the Dark One. Killed by Perrin - *Grade: F* 
1. **Demandred** - Consolidates a power base in Shara. Recruits hundreds of new Dreadlords to the cause through the Sharan Ayyad. Gathers a huge army of Sharans, and shows up for the Last Battle leading a full circle of 72 and one of the most powerful Sa'angreal ever created. His focus on Rand prevents him from utterly defeating the forces of the Light at Merrilor. Defeated by Lan when Lan Sheathes the Sword. - *Grade: A-* 
1. **Moridin** - Ishmael reincarnated. Becomes Nae'blis, but is linked to Rand when they cross the streams. This allows Rand to use the True Power, allowing him to escape from SemHirage. He fights Rand at the Last Battle, ultimately being tricked into using Callandor and becoming the conduit that allows Rand to seal the Bore. - *Grade: F* 
1. **Hessalam** - Graendal reincarnated. Orchestrates a plot to corrupt the four Great Captains, causing the forces of the Light to be defeated on several fronts. Defeated when Aviendha inadvertently reflects her compulsion while unmaking a gateway. - *Grade: B* 
1. **Moghedien** - While searching for items of the One Power, she allows herself to be distracted by Nynaeve and spends a lot of time pointlessly hunting her. Gets captured by Nynaeve and Elayne, and is forced to teach the rebel Aes Sedai many weaves from the Age of Legends. She inadvertently helps Nynaeve break her block, and then is not heard from until she tries to assume Demandred's place during the last stages of the Last Battle. She is captured by the Seanchan and Leashed. - *Grade: F* 

A - Was within striking distance of a victory for the Shadow.  
B - Significantly aided the Shadow.  
C - Challenged the Light  
D - Gained some power or notoriety, but did not accomplish anything of note.   
F - Failed to accomplish anything of note, or significantly aids the Light

Only 6 out of the 19 really did anything worthwhile, with Semhirage coming the closest to a victory for the Shadow. Padan Fain and Slayer were also successful agents of the Shadow, and I would give them an C and a A- respectively on the same scale as the Forsaken. Fain comes close to defeating Rand several times, while Slayer only messed up in that he failed to finish Perrin off when he had a chance. If Slayer kills Perrin, then the Shadow wins.

There aren't many Aes Sedai, but there are still hundreds, if not thousands. If there were 204 Black Ajah, I'm guessing that the Black numbers about 1/8 of the Tower. Why are there so few men? There's only one discovered every few years. Why does there need to be so many Red Ajah?

But I'd be interested in others. Perhaps 'The End of the Third Age' by Loial son of Arent son of Halen. It would probably be a bit redundant, but it could contain a translation of The Karatheon Prophecy. And a sort of encyclopedia, a history and a bit of epilogue to the whole series. 

However, it's a dangerous road. It would be all to easy to turn it into The History of Middle Earth or all the new Dune books. Or 'The All New Adventures Of Mat and Perrin!'

Last night and this morning, I read the scene where Semirhage captures Rand and he channels the True Power in order to get away. 

Now, most people accept that Rand's epiphany at Dragonmount at the end of the book fixed the problem. But I'm focusing on Lews Therin's response to channeling the True Power, and I'm wondering if there's not more considerable long term consequences. 

Rand begins channeling the True Power. Lews Therin's response: 

&gt; *Oh, Light! That's impossible! We can't use it! Cast it away! That is death we hold, death and betrayal.*

&gt; *It is HIM.*

That's a pretty strong reaction. Remember, leading up to this point, Lews Therin was trying like hell to kill Semirhage by any means necessary, and was half out of his mind while choking out Min, recalling his murder of Ilyena. Moreover, he knows that Semirhage's plan is to use him to destroy the people around him (including Aviendha), and then to take him to Shayol Ghul immediately and present him to the Dark One. Total defeat. And yet, when given a tool to escape, his reaction is abject terror. *We can't use it! Cast it away!*

After killing Semirhage, Lews Therin's terror remains. 

&gt; *What have you done? Oh, Light. Better to have killed again than to do this.... Oh, Light. We are doomed.*

Again, I wonder at the strength of Lews Therin's reaction. What is it about the True Power that makes him so concerned? Obviously, it's addictive. It's outright evil. It's the essence of the Dark One. But at the same time, it seems like the lesser of two evils, based on what we know. But that's not Lews Therin's reaction. Rather, he seems to think that killing all of his friends and being presented in defeat to the Dark One would be better than channeling the True Power.

It's a bizarre point in the story. She spent time with Aes Sedai, she would know it wouldnt work, so why bother? She's to shrewd to waste time so it had to be something else...

Well a few people have pointed out to me that my previous post wasn't as clear as I thought it was, and my message was misunderstood. So I am trying again, hopefully much clearer.





Theory: Tuon knows that the truth about Suldam being able to channel will rip apart the Empire as the Seanchan wont be able to handle that there will be no real difference between Suldam and Damane (the dangerous animals), This is very dangerous as the Suldam Damane relationship is the very foundation of the Empire. It could lead to devestating civil war even worse than the one she currently faces over succesion to the throne. And so she seeks to subtly change public perception of Damane by claiming that they are all volunteers by offering a treaty with Egwene to send ambassadors. 

Further eplanation: Despite learning the truth and grudgingly admitting that Suldam can channel I dont think Tuon ever wants to truly free the Damane as an endgame. Ever. She's too ruthless and Damane are her most valuable asset. She wants to send ambassadors to Egwene and make a show. The show is more so she can claim that her Damane know that they must be leashed and are in fact happy to do it, they volunteer freely, and that Suldam in fact choose not to channel. This is a tactic to keep Damane as a weapon and avoid the civil war that will result when the truth about Suldam comes out. She wants the Seanchan public to accept this new truth she has designed. She knows no Aes Sedai will come with the ambassadors, but at least she can keep her own Damane and claim the Damane know that being leashed is right for them. 

She didn't expect Egwenes counter demand of those who wish to leave being allowed to do so, and realises all the new Randland Damane she has acquired will mostly leave, but as she had just claimed in front of several witnesses that the Damane are willingly leashed she could hardly deny this demand. She knows the Seanchan are mentally broken to the leash because she trains them herself, and doubts any Seanchan born Damane would wish to leave.

So I say that this is possibly the authors solution to the Damane problem, I dont mean them all being freed at once. That would be chaos. I mean that this is the starting point of a change in the Damanes role in the history of the world. It might lead to Damane being an honored and sought after position, like the elite commandos of war. The Suldam might be phased out once they realise that Damane work willingly. Over hundreds, or thousands of years public perceptions could change, and Damane may become a different force altogether, an honored army unit of considerable rank, no longer tortured slaves.


All starting from Tuon's sly plan to avoid backlash when the truth about Suldam being able to channel. Again, I dont think she wants to one day have them all freed, but it could lead down the path I outlined over enough years

Since the beginning of the series, we,the reader, has been told again and again that what she sees come true, and it does. 

Now, regarding Tuon, her ""omens"" are considered superstitions by many fans (I being one of them).  I laughed when she would spout some ""omens"" being the reasons why she did things.  Her omens dictated her every actions, even to the point of marrying ""toy"".

When finally, these two people meet. I feel a huge reveal was given to us by RJ (through Brandon, obviously).  Tuon's omens and Min's viewing are one and the same.  

Let me explain.  When Mat told Tuon about Min's ability, the whole Seanchan crowd knew at once what she is.  Tuon proclaimed her Doomseer and demanded proof by asking Min to describe the pictures she sees, this means that a person with this talent used to exist, they even have a title for them.

During the course of their interactions, Tuon never once questioned the authenticity of Min's viewing. Tuon asks Min to describe the pictures before she gives her interpretation and Tuon was never shown as disagreeing with their interpretation. 

It is my belief that what the Blood calls omens are symbols that ancient doomseers have taught them to interpret. Though not exactly pictures, the omens in nature must be close if not exactly what Min sees in ""picture"" form.

This would explain alot of how Tuon was able to remain safe and alive despite constant threats of assassination, succession battles with her siblings, and even the machinations of Semihrage.  She follows her omens to the letter - the pattern was guiding her, the pattern needed her to be the Empress, and needed her to marry Mat (so Mat can be the leader of the light's army for the last battle, I guess)

No doubt we’ll all spend a good amount of time dissecting it here, but eventually we’ll have to move on with our lives. In that vein, I thought we could have a discussion of other books that we might use to vainly try to fill the whole in our souls that the end of WoT will bring.

I’m not spoiling anything, and I think we should try to keep the thread spoiler-free.

* A Song of Ice and Fire, George R.R. Martin:  I love it. It matches WoT in terms of cast of characters, epic feel, and scope of the world building. Much less magic, much more medieval (WoT is more Renaissance), and much darker. Major characters die, wounds are serious business (no handy Nynaeve to fix you up), peasants get slaughtered, women get raped … not a nice world, overall. But a fantastic series, and GRRM is a hell of a storyteller. These are the only books that I love on the same level as WoT.

* The Kingkiller Chronicles, Patrick Rothfuss: Really good, not as good as aSoIaF in my opinion. It’s shorter than WoT or aSoIaF, at 2 books out and one more coming. It’s essentially the story of one guy, so the cast and scope are smaller, and there’s necessarily less world-building. The structure of the book is fantastic – the main character is in the “present,” relating his life story to a biographer. He’s unapologetic about editing his life to make it more exciting and cut out the boring parts, but he’s obviously fallen from what he was. So far, he’s only told the story of his life on the up-and-up (though not without temporary setbacks, of course), and I really want to know what happens that leads to the fall.

* The Gentleman Bastards, Scott Lynch: These are just fun. Two books, plan for 7, about a couple of thieves/con-men in what is essentially a fantasy Venice. They’re page turners, and they’re hilarious. The two that are out are basically stand-alone stories, rather than one big story broken up into multiple volumes, but it looks like that’s going to start changing with book 3. Some world-building, not a huge amount, but it feels like Lynch is laying the groundwork for a bunch.

* Malazan Book of the Fallen, Steven Erikson: The only one I’m going into that I didn’t love. Very complex, massive cast of characters, and Erikson drops you right in the middle of the story. The analogy I’ve used is like trying to start WoT with Crown of Swords. I was able to handle the first two books by reading slowly and carefully and frequently consulting the list of characters so I could remember who was who, but I got to the third book and realized that I didn’t feel like it was worth the effort.

My question is if Tylin raped Mat. It's obvious why I think so because she *did* held him in knife point while he didn't want to have sex with her. I was a bit disturbed how it was written in a humorous manner so I'm just trying to clarify if I'm being too dramatic? Did RJ ever address this if this was the case? Also how come everyone was apparently okay with Mat's situation? He tried to actively escape but no one really paid attention to him.

Burn me but I could say it was traumatic to him if in a not negative way as he developed a liking for lace, (not too much lace he's no lord y'know), and the color pink and perhaps bondage if Tylin was that kinky.

This the the tought process that came to me while reading through the series again in preps for AMoL. More specifically when reading TSR Ch.1 and Min mentions that outside Tar Valon the ageless face of an Aes Sedai would only seem to be a woman who's age couldn't be placed to common folk; whereas there in the Tower proper it spoke immediately to a full Aes Sedai.

Now we know a few effects of the oath rod(s), which I believe at some point are also called the 9 rods of dominion (possibly some other Ter'angreal but I think they are the same), when a person is bound it causes the ageless face feature, it also cuts the life span of an Aes Sedai drastically. This is shown a few ways as seen upon meeting Alivia in particular being over 400 years old, though both the Aiel channelers and the Forsaken also not showing this and living to far higher ages further proves this point.

Now my theory on the original purpose of the Oath Rods is that they were only used on criminals, more specifically on those who did something bad enough that a regular punishment wouldn't suffice or perhaps on repeat offenders. I'm leaning more to repeat offenders as the rods could be used to assure they would never even be able to attempt the crime again. The cut in lifespan would be part of the punishment and the ageless face would act as a sort of scarlet letter, immediately marking those who had transgressed with an outward mark, however this one wouldn't be disfiguring and would be nearly impossible to hide.

Just wanted to say thanks for giving me the opportunity to help redesign the subreddit! I really do love the community and it's really important to me. There are just a few things that I'm going to say before we start with the feedback process.

* About 85% of the code for this subreddit was handwritten by me, the other 15% was taken from other subreddits and modified a bit to fit into the theme of the subreddit.

* The gorgeous upvote/downvote scheme was done, with much gratitude, by the great Zren

Ok now that that's out of the way, let's get on to some things before you start giving feedback.

* Obviously, since this was mostly done by hand and in a relatively short free time I had available to myself, not everything is squeaky clean. Please point out any glitches that you see especially ones concerning the use of Reddit Enhancement Suite. 

* The user flair presented a problem. The community, as far as I could tell, was pretty split with keeping the flair as it was and shrinking it to fit in-line with the usernames. The problem with shrinking was that the images became un-intelligible. A couple of solutions proposed were much smaller flair with simpler images, such as the flame of Tar Valon in Ajah colors, along with a Dragon's Fang. But before I make any changes, I want to know you're thoughts are.

* The background. As it stands, it's pretty vivid and colorful. Would you want it a bit more white-washed? Or kept as it is?

* Obviously, I still have to get to replacing the reddit alien with something more WoT related. 

* Color-Scheme and specific areas of color that you wish to see changed are all right to suggest, but let's not go too overboard.

Anyway, I've noticed Androl seems to fit a 'main character' template of Sanderson's. He has an interesting backstory that gets hinted at or dipped into(similarly see Kelsier, Kaladin, Vasher) that is drastically different than who he is prior to his appearance in the book. Androl was a wanderer of some nature, has a lifetime of experience, but is now Asha'man. Similarly, he's weak. He's the weakest Asha'man in the Black Tower - I believe stated at one point so weak that had he been female he would have been turned away from the White Tower. But he has an unusual Talent for Gateways - an unmatched talent with them, even. And where others treat it as just another weave, Androl makes it the entire core of his magical being. In a way, Androl isn't a Channeler, he's a Gater. His form of magic isn't weaving the Saidin, but rather it's manipulating gateways. He can do things instinctively with Gateways that no one else even thought to try, and uses his Talent to make him one of the most powerful Asha'man despite the fact that he has no strength in the Power. Actually, Androl reminds me a *lot* of Raoden(Elantris). 

Naturally Sanderson was given room to write his own characters into the series, and maybe it's just his writing style, but it feels like Androl was his way of ""getting out"" his love of playing with magic systems in unusual ways.

Contemplating the Aiel, they seem to be a little too effective in combat to be plausible. I can understand that they're very good at fighting, that they have been forged by the Waste, and all that. However, there seem to be some basic problems that would impede them greatly as a military force.  They never use horses, so they have absolutely no cavalry*, whether for raiding, scouting or protecting their flanks. They don't seem to use pikes or halberd formations either, so I don't see how they'd handle heavy cavalry charges. Finally, to the best of my memory none of them are mentioned as wearing any serious armour, even chain shirts. Even their bucklers are made out of hide, I think. If this is the case, they don't even have any heavy infantry.

In a nutshell, the entire army seems to be comprised of light infantry and archers, which are all very well in the correct place, but this would leave some gaping holes in their armies. Cavalry archers could riddle them with arrows. Heavy cavalry would smash great big holes in their formations. Pike phalanxes could grind them down from in front while light cavalry circled them and made flanking attacks. These would all be real problems for even the best light infantry.

I don't know if they use siege equipment (I assume they must, or they couldn't have taken Cairhien during the Aiel War). If they do not, walls would be a huge problem for them. They took the Stone by stealth, but frontal assaults on alert city walls would be out of the question.

Given these clear problems, how is it that only 4 clans were able to give everyone such a hard time in the Aiel wars? Isn't it all rather unlikely?

He was the only one not to be killed or punished, and still was not promoted to Naeblis. Things like this turned him against the light the first time.

Not everyone has to be on the side of light for good reasons. Heck most of those on the side of light are individually horrible people (the leaders).

It seems to me the whole analogy of the ""wheel"" and the weaves of people's possible lives or conscious lives that make up ""reality"" in the story should so closely resemble real world/ hard core sci-fi cosmology parallel worlds stuff; yet still somehow stays in the framework of the fantasy genre.

For example, since the Dark One exists outside the pattern a.k.a (space-time) he really can't be defined or destroyed until rand pulls him through using both the male and female halves of the power as well as the Dark one's own inter-dimensional True power in order to force him to submit to the laws of the Wheel's universe. (side-note I like how the Dark One ends up being an evil writhing black ball of hyper-intelligent cosmic slime) 

There are also many allusions (too many to reference) all throughout the series that the age of legends was essentially an age of high technology. The one power was seen less as a divine or sorcery type phenomenon and more of a practical resource on which humanity channelers and non channelers build their entire world. 

IMO this leads me to believe The Bore was essentially a failed science experiment that ends the world because of mankind's Hubris in thinking that they were the true lone masters of the world/multi-verse...enter the Dark One ect. ect. ect....And what about the mysterious realm of the Snakes and Foxes?! (I wont get into it I've probably already bored anyone reading this to death)

I started reading WoT back in 2002.  I plowed through the series pretty quickly, really enjoying it into Lords of Chaos.  It seemed to slow starting with Crown of Swords and halfway through Winter's Heart, I realized that the next book coming out wouldn't be the last.  I decided to set the series down until it was finished.  

I was sad to learn of Robert Jordan's passing, but glad that someone would be taking up his notes and continuing the story.  Earlier this year, I started reading the series again.  What a rush!  Once Knife of Dreams hit it was pretty much full steam ahead and I was surprised that it didn't miss a beat when Brandon Sanderson took over.

I really haven't been a part of the WoT community, so I haven't read tons of forums, and I had some questions I was hoping to ask.

* When Perrin finds out Faile is in Malden, he also finds a Darkhound pack near his camp.  Did anything ever come of this?
* I have a feeling Taim is actually Demandred, and he's replacing all the Asha'man with shadowspawn.  There's probably also a Dreamspike in the Black Tower, preventing travelling.  I really wish Rand hadn't stayed away after going to Dragonmount.  He's had a month.  Going to visit a pretty vital part of his army never occurred to him?  Travelling only stopped working a day or two before the gathering at the Field of Merrilor.
* I think Brandon Sanderson writes Mat so much better than Robert Jordan.  He was always a bit of comic relief, doing silly and buffoonish things, and it made me smile.  But after Brandon started writing, I started actually laughing out loud.  The cover stories he wrote just before trying to get into that town were hilarious, it reminding me of [Gabe from Penny Arcade becoming a Dungeon Master](http://penny-arcade.com/comic/2008/12/29).  Not really a question, more of an observation.
* Do either Galad or Rand know they're half brothers?  Do you think either will ever realize this?  Berelain will probably be pretty pleased to learn this.
* When Mat is trying to escape the Tower of Ghenji, he makes his way to the red doorway that should lead to Tear, but finds it shattered.

Basically, they are supposedly the lost tribes of Israel that were locked behind a wall by Alexander the Great, and became the nations of Gog and Magog. In the middle ages, it was thought that at the end of the world, the Red Jews would come out of Gog and Magog, break down the Gates of Alexander, and destroy Christian Europe. 

Knowing that many cultures in the WoT have strong paralells with real-world cultures and places, I am pretty sure now that we will see the Red Aiel coming from Gog and Magog (Aiel cities hidden in the blight).

I was thinking about races, and skin colour in fantasy series, because sometimes fantasy can sometimes be a bit racist. I think WoT is really good in this regard, people coming from all places to fight the Shadow or fight for the Shadow.

Anyway, I came across a line in EotW that I wouldn't have thought anything of otherwise. When the Two Rivers characters are being introduced, Egwene is described as being ""Of a height with Nynaeve, and with the same dark coloring"". (EotW, Chapter 3) When Nynaeve is introduced the colour of her dark braid is mentioned but nothing else. It could just be to describe the colour of her eyes and hair, since all TR folk have the dark coloured eyes and hair. 

I didn't really think about it for a while, but when Rand was brought before Morgase towards the end of the book, Elaida doubts that he is actually from the Two Rivers. She made the obvious observations about his eyes and hair, and then... ""Her hand darted out to push back his coat sleeve, exposing lighter skin the sun had not reached so often. 'Or such skin.'"" (EotW, Chapter 40) 

She's saying, pretty indirectly, that of what little she is aware of the appearance of Two Rivers folk, which can't be much, *they are definitely not this naturally pale.* 

And if there is a group of naturally isolated people who all have dark eyes and hair, isn't it strange to assume they're white?

I'm not saying they're as ebony dark as Seanchan royalty, but maybe brown? I only ask because, since thinking about this, I've noticed that fan art tends to paint our main characters a little monochromatically.

I also wanted to share what my headcanon of [what Mat looks like](http://imgur.com/4CVZMZt), only about twenty, obviously.

Edit: It seems a pretty popular idea that they are tanned, though the quote from Elaida seems to suggest colouring rather than tan, (She specifically checks where he is untanned to see whether his skin is Two-Riversian) I'm willing to submit that they are probably darker European in appearance. I didn't actually think they would be African, just darker than hey are normally portrayed.

While I really enjoyed AMoL something seemed to be missing from it that I couldn't place and it suddenly clicked this morning.  For the first time since The Eye of the World I didn't have a ""holy shit"" moment where I realized RJ had been foreshadowing something about 10 books in advance that I didn't expect. Sure there were plenty of things from Min's viewings and prophecy (blood on the rocks for example) that were revealed, but nothing that was really mind blowing for me.

I remember in every other book that I read setting it down at one point and just thinking DAAAAAMN how did I miss that??? (Example: Verin is Black Ajah, or that Rand had been channeling throughout the first book before he even got to the Eye of the World)  The closest I came to that in AMoL was when Alivia helped Rand Die through a body swap. It wasn't that I knew what was going to happen obviously, but I knew something would happen with his death and had some feeling since the beginning that Rand had a 50/50 chance of coming out alive. 

Anyway, I just thought I'd point that out since it was one of the things that consistently blew my mind from book to book. ""What did RJ stick under my nose this time that I'm completely missing.""

Rand and Egwene were particularly good in this book. Rand finally realising that he isn't responsible for everyone, that they made their choice as much as he did, was a great moment. Andral was pretty awesome in this book as well, and while he was out the Last Battle for a fair amount of time Perrin too had some great moments. Lan gets some terrific scenes. Hell, most of the characters do.

There were some less than stellar character arcs. Moiraine didn't really do anything, Gawyn could've been done better, Fain felt wasted. But generally most characters shone.

However, my favourite character arcs were probably Logain and Mat. After initially being presented as a villain, we've slowly come to understand his motivations. He's suffered a similar fate that Rand did - being captured and held helpless - but for a longer period of time. Like Gawyn, he was never quite good enough. His lust for power is understandable: he doesn't want to be helpless, and he doesn't want the Black Tower to be helpless. His final moments in the book, choosing to help the people instead of seeking power were great. The moment when he realises that the people are looking at him with awe were, I think, incredibly powerful. He could've chosen the 'glory' of power, but he doesn't.

But I think Mat was the strongest of all the characters in this book. All three of the main men had great moments, but Mat outshone them I think. He had some pretty funny moments throughout, but it was his battle of wits and strategy with Demandred that shone brightest of all. Mat has always been pretty awesome. His duel with Gawyn and Galad was one of the highlights of the series. But where Rand and Perrin have accepted their duties and their roles, Mat started the book again trying to avoid his. And when he finally does accept his duty, he is commanding the entire forces of the light near enough. Sanderson struggled with Mat to being with, but the Mat we see in this book more than makes up for that imo. While Rand's powers have always been at the forefront, and Perrin's wolfishness came into play into the last few books, I always felt that Mat's memories weren't being used to their potential. His luck was always his focus, and his memories only came up every now and again with him speaking a few lines here or there or commenting on a battle plan. And then we get a 200 page chapter focused around Mat's memories. He's not just an exceptionally luck gambler who can speak an ancient language. He's become the greatest of the great captains; a master of strategy and tactics to rival even Demandred or Hawkwing. 

Throughout the whole series, Rand's is still my favourite overall story arc. His descent into madness and darkness is so gradual that you don't realise how far he has gone until Semhirage points it out. But in this particular book, Mat was my favourite character.

Anyone else have life-memories tied to WoT?,24,0,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/WoT/comments/xkaar/major_wheel_of_time_nostalgia_after_reading_that/,"It's amazing how books, like smells or music, play such a huge role in memories and general nostalgia.  I remember reading the Redwall books and Lloyd Alexander at a young age, I was a pretty voracious young reader.

I'm 27 now, and I remember reading the Eye of the World in the summer going into 6th grade, I think I was 11 years old (95'ish).  To this day, I still remember the feeling of danger the night the trollocs invaded Tam al'Thor's farm house, the sense of adventure as the boys set out from Two Rivers and got their first taste of city-life, and the sense of how epic this was going to get as I realized how big and magical the world that Robert Jordan had crafted really was.

I don't know if I actually was a sick middle-schooler, or if I just was faking it so I could stay at home and read these books (and sneak in some Final Fantasy II/III or Chrono Trigger).  I know my mom has a picture of me somewhere and I'm posted up on the couch after getting a tooth pulled wearing sweatpants as a 12 year old kid reading TGH.  It's funny because I followed along with the books up until Senior year of Highschool and then I got side-tracked.  Sports, College, etc. and I missed out on all the books after Winter's Heart. I took about a 7 year break from WoT, but they were always still a part of me.

Last year I started my first Re-read (starting over so I could remember as well as pick up things I might have missed in my youth).  The nostalgia was intense.  Reading through EotW and TGH and the rest of the books I had read already I would remember bits and pieces of my childhood.  Certain chapters would remind me of the chicken soup or beef stew my Mom would make.  Some books would remind me of that snowstorm we had and the feeling of comfort of sitting with a favorite book in a comfortable house.  Characters would remind me of songs on the radio at the time.  That was one of the most satisfying things I've ever experienced now that I'm an ""adult"" working a 9-5, drinking, having and losing relationships, and generally doing adult-like things, it hits home even harder, there's even a sense of melancholy to it.

I slogged through the ""boring books"" which to me, weren't that bad, and it annoys me when people have to constantly bring it up, or suggest skipping chapters.  Then i arrived at TGS and ToM.  Holy Mother of the Creator.  Thank you Brandon Sanderson.  I noticed little differences in the writing style etc, but those books were AMAZING.  If you are reading this, what you did with all the characters was amazing.  I can't wait to read your other books soon.  Anyway, after reading his blog post yesterday the nostalgia hit me, and something that has been a part of my life for 17/27 years will come to a close.  That is very significant, but one day I will share it with my kids, and I can always re-read them and feel that nostalgia again.

I was also upset at myself for never having heard or picked up one of his books until this last year when they had been around for nearly all of my life.

I was thinking about what the One Power was, and what the True Source was and where the duality to the True Source exists.  I thought I'd throw it out there to you folks so you can pick it apart, fit items in, etc.  It's about the structure of the WOT universe, and how stuff works.  Here goes:

So, my thoughts go something like this:  When the Creator created the Wheel of Time, he did it in part to create a barrier of order between himself and the Dark One.  In a way, it's similar to the [Stephen R Donaldson's Arch of Time from Thomas Covenant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chronicles_of_Thomas_Covenant), he made it and cannot now reach into the pattern for fear of destroying his creation.  The pattern was the world created by the Wheel of Time and the by-product of the Creator's power.  If you are familiar with [Zelazny's Amber series](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chronicles_of_Amber), it's similar to the Pattern and Logrus.  This might also explain the existence of a world that in many ways mirrors our own, that as a by product there are actually many universes, one of which is ours, one of which is Rand's &amp; co's.  Even one with King Arthur, etc.  Ta'veren are spun by the Wheel as a way to restore balance to the pattern and fight the influence of the Dark One, it's kind of like a fail safe for the Wheel created by the Creator.  While they are created by the Wheel, they are able to shape the pattern.

The One Power and the True Source, on the other hand, are by-products of the Dark One.  The True Source is directly using the Dark One's Power, while the One Power is using the pattern to filter his essence.  Using either, you can change, shape, and even burn out (balefire) sections of the pattern.  When Saidin was tainted, that filter was damaged.

This also fits with the popular theories on how [Rand lit his pipe](http://www.reddit.com/r/WoT/comments/177idx/rands_pipe_spoilers_all/).  Now that he understands the nature of the pattern (from his battle with the Dark One), he has no need for the by product of the Dark One, he can use his nature and understanding to directly influence the pattern itself (Sounds a bit Neo/Matrixish, doesn't it?).  This understanding wasn't really sudden either, he starts to understand a lot as evidenced by his chat with Cadsuane (where he threatened to stop her heart using this) and when he was using his Ta'veren abilities to stop the Dark One's influence (many times after the scene on the Dragonmount).

I understand this pulls on some different literary sources and so might be influenced by my reading of Fantasy/Sci-Fi, but we know that Jordan liked to draw from influences from everyone, so it fits this way.

tl;dr The Balance to the True Source is the Pattern and Ta'veren abilities.

To provide an example, consider the long-running conflicts between Nynaeve and Elayne. Or consider the dispute between Mat and the Supergirls; they assume he's being a jerk because he's just a jerk, while he considers his attitude perfectly reasonable in the face of their earlier dickishness. Or try Rand and Egwene, who both dismiss the other with some nasty insults that imply that neither one really valued the merit of the other's arguments. 

The fundamental attribution error sits at the heart of most of the major issues in the series, especially when it comes to the male/female conflict.

 Is it maybe that the one power heals them fast enough that they don't get to die? And in the case of two channelers bonded, would they both heal, or would who placed the bond matter?

Him: ""Just read, it's really cool.""



So I get to Mat's hanging, and Rand reviving him...walked over and punched my roommate. 



He says, ""Got to Rhuidean huh? See?""

Me: ""You dick, he didn't even die. He came close.""

Him: ""Hah, ok but he really does die in Book 5.""



To which I rolled my eyes, and he backed it up with a ""seriously."" Of course at this point I knew the prophecy meant he would die and live through it somehow, so I just chuckled when Rand balefired him back into existence.

Whenever I talk with my friends about WoT, Olver is always a point of speculation. One friend even goes so far as to say he thinks RJ lied when he said Olver is not Gaidal Cain, since Rowling did at one point lie about something in the Harry Potter series to prevent spoilers. 

I tried to do some research into this, and I am missing a few points, but the theory I've arrived at is that Olver is actually Robert Jordan himself reborn. I'll try to base this on a few points, even though I know this idea is still riddled with holes.

The first point is that both seem obsessed with history, whether it's through Jordan's own experiences or stories of how Olver always listens with such intensity to Noal's tales.

Secondly, I think there's a lot to be said about Olver's physical description. I know that if I were to describe myself, I would probably paint myself as the ugliest goat-kisser you'd ever met. Whether that was true for Jordan or not, I may never know. I know Olver's description does not match Jordan during his later years, but I often wonder what Jordan looked like as a child.

The next point is the one I remember least (again, I need to start reading again), but I seem to remember both RJ and Olver as capable swordsmen, even if Olver was only starting to learn. Again, I need to research more there.

Both also enjoyed games - Olver's Snakes and Foxes to Jordan's chess, pool, and poker.

The piece that has me most convinced, though, is in the name itself. Jordan borrowed heavily in naming from people that he knew. Olver could rather quickly be inferred from Jordan's real name, James Oliver Rigney.

I do remember hearing once that it was explicitly stated that Randland was a future-or-past Earth. I also remember the line from the books that ""everyone is someone reborn,"" but I couldn't find the line again through a casual search.

While discussing her activities in New Spring, we realized that there are at least two versions of New Spring - a short story and then a novella based on the short story.  It appears that while she read the short story of New Spring, the audiobook is a reading of the novella.

There is at least one very important scene in the novella that doesn't appear at all in any form in the short story - in it [](/s ""Moiraine visits an inn called The Silver Penny.  The innkeeper attempts to poison her wine, with the intent that she and her partners will rob/rape/whatever.  Their specific intent isn't clear, although they are clearly brigands and entirely unsympathetic.  Moiraine gets the best of her and then forces her to drink the wine.  The innkeeper falls to the floor, incapacitated.  Jordan describes a very lurid scene where the inkeeper is trying to drag herself across the floor, as some of the customers leave and others, including her erstwhile companions, circle around to rape and/or murder her.  The scene is quite explicit, describing the woman's skirts riding up to expose silk stockings and bare thighs, and it's very clear that Moiraine understands exactly what she is abandoning the woman to: as she leaves her internal monologue is something to the effect that sometimes justice isn't meted out by courts or swords."")

So I have two questions: 

One, are there other major differences between the two versions of New Spring?  I'd be curious to know if there are any scenes from the short story that didn't make it into the novella or were significantly changed, as well.

Two, this scene completely changed my view of Moiraine; I think it was unconscionable behavior and I can't stop hating her for it.  [](/s ""Even if you buy into a sort of 'eye for an eye' argument that she is leaving the innkeeper to a fate no worse than what was intended for her, that ignores the fact that the innkeeper bears all of the punishment that should have gone to her and her compatriots, and bears that punishment at the hands of those very compatriots.  It's not justice at all; at best it is sadistic and vengeful."")My friend the Moiraine fan has simply decided that since Jordan wrote both she can ignore the novella and pretend this scene doesn't exist.

I am brand new to the series (bought EotW two days ago), and have a question in regards to something big I think I may have just spoiled for myself, because if I have I'll be pretty upset.


Now, last night I started reading and got through only a few pages in the first chapter, because I'm pretty sick at the moment. But before I went to bed I wanted to see if I could find a pic of Rand to see if he was the same guy on the cover.


When I searched Rand al'Thor in google of course his wiki page came up first. I don't remember if I clicked his page or saw the description in the google browser, but I'm pretty sure I saw something along the lines of, ""Rand al'Thor, otherwise known as Dragon..."". And at this point I know Dragon was the alias of Lews Therin from the prologue before he got struck by lightning and turned into a mountain (that's how my noobie mind has understood it :p). 


So did...did I just ruin something big that's supposed to be revealed later? And of course, please try and not spoil more for me if you can.

1361188197.0,21,self.WoT,18qvy8,My review of AMoL [Heavy AMoL spoilers throughout],31,10,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/WoT/comments/18qvy8/my_review_of_amol_heavy_amol_spoilers_throughout/,"Let me preface this with a warning: This is going to be a mixed review with a few points of fairly sharp criticism.  I also want to preface it by saying that I love Brandon's work and that he was one of my favorite fantasy authors even before I first picked up *The Eye of the World* some five or six years ago.

Now that I've read through the series, Jordan is also among my favorite authors and WoT among my favorite series.  So I say this as someone who greatly admires both RJ's and Sanderson's work.

Yet I still found myself torn about AMoL and the three-book conclusion of the series as a whole.  There are parts of it I love, and it certainly is at no point a disastrous conclusion, but I still can't shake a feeling of mild disappointment and frustration.

Why?  I think a large part of it is the number of issues Jordan apparently wanted to leave ambiguous, and those can't be blamed on Brandon.  As I see it, there are two huge sweeping arcs which are confirmed that RJ wanted to be left largely ambiguous and unexplained, and I don't like that it's the case for either of them:

* Rand's insanity.  This was addressed somewhat in the merging of Rand and Lews Therin in TGS, but I always thought it would actively play into the Last Battle and the ultimate conclusion of the series.  For it not to even come up felt incomplete; either it was resolved too soon, or should have had an additional plot twist play more of a part in the ending itself.

* Rand's death and body switch (with Alivia's help).  Brandon has said over and over again that Jordan wanted this to be left ambiguous.  For something so important and so heavily foreshadowed I dislike being left so much in the dark about it, although I certainly understand and agree with Brandon wanting to respect Jordan's wishes.  But I can still say I'm dissatisfied with the result and wish that the rationale had been explained.

Then there are the things I feel didn't tie into the last battle strongly enough given how much they were foreshadowed--not sure in this case how much was due to RJ's outline and how much Brandon had control over:

* Ta'veren connection (seeing colors and such)--I was sure this would have some direct link with how Rand would ultimately defeat the Dark One.   Not sure why the three of them needed to constantly see where each other were for so many books, it didn't seem to have much significance in the end.  Mat and Perrin already knew where Rand was because damn near everyone in Randland knew where he was at that moment, and it didn't play into the direct confrontation between Rand and the DO in any way.

* The two wounds and bleeding on Shayol Ghul: With as much as this was built up to, I thought Rand's blood would have some special significance to what happened.  It didn't seem to matter beyond the bare fact of fulfilling prophecy, and that felt anticlimactic.  Likewise, I thought it was heavily foreshadowed that Rand's wounds gave him some kind of connection to both TDO and Mashadar.  I didn't have some specific idea what relevance this would have, but I felt so certain it would matter in some way, and then it didn't seem to have any effect.

* Padan Fain: This ties into the one above, but damn was his death anticlimactic for me.  Mat basically just walks up and stabs him?  That's it?  He wasn't anything more than a bare complication to be dealt with?  He didn't play into the Last Battle in any way other than being another monkey wrench thrown into the mix?  He never even confronted Rand after hunting him for so long and then wounding him?

* The Seanchan.  This was touched on more than most of the others so I can give it a *slight* pass, but I still want to at least bring it up.  The Seanchan attitude toward channelers and their belief they have a right to conquer Randland are both completely untenable without further war and I had hoped to be given a *little* more basis to believe those issues would be resolved.  I would have loved it if we'd been allowed to see the conversation between Tuon and Hawkwing.  That would've gone a long way.  Maybe another of those things RJ wanted left ambiguous for whatever reason?  Anyway, I was a little dissatisfied with the way this wound up.

Those are the biggest plot arcs where I felt dissatisfied with the conclusions.  I also want to say that I felt the battle scenes dragged at times, and I wish that less time had been spent on them and more on some of the things I mentioned above.  Still, I understand that they needed to seem suitably epic after building up to Tarmon Gai'don for so long.  It's a tough balance to strike, trying to stride that line where you're epic enough without being tedious, and if Brandon stepped into the tedious side occasionally, I suppose it's understandable.

Now, after **all that complaining**, I do want to point out at least a few things I loved about the book.

* Pevara and Androl were an awesome storyline.  I really liked Androl and I liked how Pevara became a more fleshed out and sympathetic character.  I also liked the idea of Androl's gateway talent and how it resulted in some fun Portal-esque Shadow-killin'.

* Egwene's death was beautiful and heartbreaking at the same time.  I'm still a little upset about it, and that's the mark of great execution (no pun intended).

* Even though I complained about major plot threads a lot, I did feel like most of them were at least touched upon and none of them were concluded in a way which made me go, ""WTF, are you *serious* with this crap?"" Like I have with some long-running SF/F stories (COUGH, Battlestar Galactica).  I break free of the Wheel with a sense of mild disappointment, but none of that sharp betrayal of an ending gone horribly wrong.  For the most part there was no deus ex machina and the resolutions to various things (the ones actually explained) made sense--it was more that too many mysteries were left out of reach, but with the sense that there *was* an answer, and some things were resolved in too trite of ways.  My point is, to conclude a story this huge with just mild disappointment is actually a success, in a way--so many stories which run even a fraction of this long screw it up completely, and this was more of a mediocre finish than a bad one.

* Most of the characters' voices were impeccable.  There was an occasional jarring moment, most often involving Mat, but Brandon *nailed* most of the characters.

* The number of minor storylines which were resolved in some way or another is nothing short of impressive.  I'm not going to start rattling off example after example, but I will point out one I particularly liked: Elayne/Birgitte/Mellar.

Anyway, this has already gone on long enough.  WoT is a great and iconic fantasy series which I may some day undertake re-reading, although I shudder at the effort it will require.  The ending, while not as great as I had hoped, at least achieves a passing grade.

(Whole series spoilers.)",22,3,57,http://www.reddit.com/r/WoT/comments/179vv5/now_that_the_series_is_done_if_you_had_the_chance/,"To start, I loved AMoL. I love the whole series. Brandon did a wonderful job with his part, and I am so thankful that he put so much of his heart, mind, and soul into it to make it what it became. Same to Robert Jordan, the man was a unique type of genius who made my life richer despite never meeting him.

That said, as I finally finished my 15-year journey through the series, I couldn't help but wonder what could have been. Some parts had to be mercilessly cut out, while there are common complaints about certain things that were drawn out for way too long. So what would you change? How would you alter the story in order to get to the same place, but perhaps have a different journey along the way?

My big edit became apparent as I drew to the end of AMoL. Here's what I think I would do, given the chance to rearrange time time/space continuum at the moment I locked the Dark One away:

I would delete Malden. It wouldn't even be a thing. The Shaido would have remained scattered and been hunted down in all the nations through which they were scattered.

Instead, I would have contrived some reason to move the Horn of Valere far earlier, and it would have been entrusted to Perrin. Perhaps Rand, totally distrusting of Aes Sedai, filches it from the White Tower and taps Perrin to hunt down Mat and get it to him.

Then we get the same thing, with the gateway going awry due to a bubble of evil, and Perrin, Faile, and co. end up in the Blight.

Now, all the screen time that we would have spent on Faile being a captive and Perrin being full emo, we instead spend watching the couple learn to work together to lead their men safely out of the Blight. Perrin accepts that he must rise up and become the leader of these poor souls if any are to make it out alive, and he grows closer to his wife through the incredible danger. Maybe they even end up with Masema and the Dragonsworn there somehow, and Faile takes care of them, I don't care.

So the battered and broken survivors of the horrific journey finally make their way out of the Blight and to a village, and BAM! Shara. They were on the wrong side of the world, and traveling south put them right into an Ayyad village.

Adventure adventure adventure, chase scene, recovery, plot plot plot, and Perrin leads an army of the Sharans who doubted Demandred's street cred into the Aiel Waste, find Rhuidean, and hitch a ride to the Last Battle.

No Whitecloaks. We closed that storyline back in the Two Rivers. Masema can come along if you really want him, but I don't think he's important. Perrin doesn't meet the Seanchan, because who freaking cares if Perrin met the Seanchan? That line didn't go anywhere, because it was Mat who was supposed to nail them down all along. Instead, let's get a ta'veren to Shara!

I think a good traveling adventure like this would have brought the series back to its roots, and it would have had so much greater a sense of motion and pace than the standing-around marathon that was Malden. It still would have given Perrin and Faile the chance to grow and develop into who they needed to be, perhaps even moreso.

**Evidence**: In the AMoL prologue, when we have the Androl POV we see that he sees shadows coming to get him. He thinks that ""The taint is cleansed, why is it getting worse?!?!"", so we know the madness is still getting worse for him even though the taint is cleansed.

Now, during a recent Q&amp;A session with Brandon Sanderson, he said that Mazrim Taim's palace is made of thakan'dar stone, i.e. stone from the slopes of Shayol Ghul. This stone could, logically, maintain some connection to or taint of the Dark One. 

This could explain why the madness is still getting worse: some remnant of the taint (or maybe just essense of the Dark One) remains in these stones, and is seeping into the people around it.

In terms of clues as to what Demandred is up to, we have very few. At one point he tells Moridin that ""my rule is secure,"" whatever that means, and Graendal thinks that ""events to the south"" have his fingerprints.

The most common theory seems to be that he is posing as King Roedran of Murandy, who had a reputation as being a complete dissolute and completely ineffective ruler, and then managed (according to reports) to get Murandy pretty well united through the ploy of hiring the Band of the Red Hand to pose as an invading army, and then unite Murandy against that threat.

Is the seal from when Lanfear blasted through the Bore and Lews Therin fixed it? Before that point, was Lews Therin the dragon?

I've read it over a few times, and did a search for it, but does anyone know what happened here?

&gt;Suddenly Rand realized what had been nagging at him about the man. The scattered torches in the hallway had given each of them a ring of shadows, just as the torches in the treasure room did. Only . . . He was so shocked he said it out loud. ""You don't have a shadow."" A goblet fell from Mat's hand with a crash. Mordeth nodded, and for the first time his fleshy eyelids opened all the way. His sleek face suddenly appeared pinched and hungry. ""So."" He stood straighter, seeming taller. ""It is decided."" Abruptly there was no seeming to it. Like a balloon Mordeth swelled, distorted, head pressed against the ceiling, shoulders butting the walls, filling the end of the room, cutting off escape. Hollow-cheeked, teeth bared in a rictus snarl, he reached out with hands big enough to engulf a man's head.

&gt;With a yell Rand leaped back. His feet tangled in a gold chain, and he crashed to the floor, the wind knocked out of him. Struggling for breath, he struggled at the same time for his sword, fighting his cloak, which had become wrapped around the hilt. The yells of his friends filled the room, and the clash of goldplatters and goblets clattering across the floor. Suddenly an agonized scream shivered in Rand's ears. Almost sobbing, he managed to inhale at last, just as he got the sword out of its sheath. Cautiously, he got to his feet, wondering which of his friends had given that scream. Perrin looked back at him wide-eyed from across the room, crouched and holding his axe back as if about to chop down a tree. Mat peered around the side of a treasure pile, clutching a dagger snatched from the trove. Something moved in the deepest part of the shadows left by the torches, and they all jumped. It was Mordeth, clutching his knees to his chest and huddled as deep into the furthest comer as he could get.

&gt;""He tricked us,"" Mat panted. ""It was some kind of trick."" Mordeth threw back his head and wailed; dust sifted down as the walls trembled. ""You are all dead!"" he cried. ""All dead!"" And he leaped up, diving across the room. Rand's jaw dropped, and he almost dropped the sword as well. As Mordeth dove through the air, he stretched out and thinned, like a tendril of smoke. As thin as a finger he struck a crack in the wall tiles and vanished into it. A last cry hung in the room as he vanished, fading slowly away after he was gone. ""You are all dead!""

The mysteries are:

1. The agonizing scream

2. Mordeth's posture (huddled in the corner)

3. Mat's reaction (what did he do/see to know it was a trick?)

4. Mordeth just leaving

Some things I've eliminated:

* [It wasn't Rand channelling](http://www.steelypips.org/wotfaq/2_nondark/2.1_taveren/2.1.4_rand-op-syn.html)
* It probably wasn't Moiraine erecting her ward

1356976703.0,18,self.WoT,15qdky,THEORY: Returning to the Light,23,5,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/WoT/comments/15qdky/theory_returning_to_the_light/,"SPOILER ALERT: Discusses various theories in books, speculation about A Memory of Light.

""No man can stand in the Shadow so long that he cannot find the Light again.""

It's one of the first repeated quotes in the entire Wheel of Time series. With A Memory of Light being an end to the series, and the culmination of everything, it feels that something may be done.

There's a lot with turning to the Dark One. The forces of the Dark have the circle of thirteen channelers linked with thirteen Myrddraal to convert a channeler to the Dark One. It's speculated (confirmed?) that the Black Tower is corrupted by this. 

Like everything in Randland, there must be opposites. The existence of the quote seems to be hinting that there should be something for Darkfriends to return to the light. We have examples such as Ingtar and Verin who ultimately do something good.

I theorize that at least some of the Darkfriends/Forsaken we have seen will play a pivotal role in the final book. Characters such as Lanfear/Cyndane, Ishmael/Moridin, and the turned in the Black Tower could potentially influence it.

Especially in the cases of Lanfear and Ishmael, the two strongest male/female channelers, they did not have the strongest of reasons to turn to the Dark. Lanfear is seen at the end of ToM as pleading for Rand to help her. Ishmael turned because of his philosophy.

The assistance of one of these two (or both), or other former Darkfriends/Forsaken, could be necessary for Rand to succeed. Otherwise, several of the Forsaken are still lose. There are only a few strong channelers on the side of the Light. There's Rand, and some of the strongest females, but there's basically no confirmed male channelers but Logain, who is lost. At least there's Callandor, but there's also the question of the second-strongest sa'angreal.

Even in numbers, the Light may not be stronger. All of the male Aiel channelers have been corrupted by their captures in the Blight. Considering the amount of channelers the Aiel have, their numbers may be massive. Shara is a dark horse; nothing is known about them.

The Last Battle will, at the very least, involve actual battles. If Ishmael is the Champion of the Dark, and the Dragon the Champion of the Light, then they would need to fight. They are equal in power and skill. How would Rand first defeat him and then fight the Dark One?

Furthermore, Lanfear had previously offered Rand support (though with the Choedan Kal) that them two could defeat the Dark One. Her jealousy over Rand's three girlfriends may make her untrustworthy, but alone of all the Forsaken she has directly offered aid to Rand.

Ishmael supports the Dark One purely because of his criticism of the Wheel of Time. He hopes that something will change. Rand has had his revelation that love is what matters, and so Rand is willing to live over and over again to experience the world. If Ishmael has a similar revelation, it is likely he would turn. 

Asmodean is said to have already returned to the Light. Maybe he may make another appearance? If the Dark can return lost souls, why can't the Light?

Still, in pure terms of channeling power and distribution, in a direct conflict, the victory of the Light seems like it would require some of the Dark channelers to turn.",,False,self,t5_2rdg1,False,,,True,t3_15qdky,http://www.reddit.com/r/WoT/comments/15qdky/theory_returning_to_the_light/,

Callandor blazed in his hands like the sun till he thought it would melt. He thought he himself would melt from the surge of the One Power through him, the flood that he somehow directed into sealing up the hole that had opened around him, into holding himself on the side of existence.

Rand is not sealing the dark one away, but shutting him out of the...egg of the universe if you will. The universe IS the flame and the dark one is the void.
  
The flame represents everything, the void represents nothing. When Rand confronts the dark one, the Dark One claims that he is the TRUTH. Moridin is Nae'Blis, because he knows the truth of it, and therefore has no ignorance, where ignorance is bliss. hence No Bliss, or Nae'Blis(He was a philospher and very logical before Lanfear unleashed the dark one.)  
  
So, if the Dark One is nothing, and the Truth(black half of the ancient aes sedai symbol) then the balance, as everything must be in balance, is that Everything(the white half) must then be a lie.
Further, if you think about it, everything cannot come from nothing.  
  
Therefore, we can define nothing as possible. And everything as impossible(a lie.) But it does exist, and it exists because by existing while being impossible for it to exist, it balances the fact that nothing essentially does not exist, while being the only thing possible to exist.  
  
Pretty crazy as hell to wrap your head around that last bit haha. So essentially you have the dark one(nothing/black half) trying to crush everything so it can truly be nothing while Everything(the white half/the pattern) seeks to fill the endlessness in an eternal and unwinnable battle, yet both needing the other to define the other(you notice as Rand and thus the forces of the light rises, so does the shadow. Always balance!).  
  
The ancient Aes Sedai symbol even looks like they are chasing each other in a circle. Or the Serpent eating it's on tail. Hence the eternal battle. Also, the Dark One being the creator is why the forsaken call themselves the chosen, though I think only Moridin knows the truth of that.  
  
The Dark One can also break unbreakable Cuendillar, which is something I imagine only the creator could do. I also found it interesting that Moridin, or Ishmael, the Betrayer of Hope, is kind of...the only hope. Rand is the White half, Moridin the Dark, and without one or the other, the bore could not have been sealed.
  
They both represent the pinnacles of good or evil in men. Anyways, enough Rambling. The Dark One is The Creator, and Rand seals him OUT of their prison, not into one. Read it, think about it.  
  
**Edit: Modern theories suggest a creator cannot exist within it's creation, and when Rand confront's the Dark One, he is floating outside the pattern of existence, in the eternal void of the Dark One. Outside of the pattern, not in a prison of the pattern. (Rand views the whole pattern, not part of it through a hole in a prison, yet he got out of the pattern by leaving through a hole in it, the Bore.)  
  
Also, if the creator cannot be inside the pattern, and the Dark One is the endless eternal void outside of the pattern, there is no where for the creator to exist.

**Come, I show you the end**

**You're damned**

**Cause noone can defy me**

Just watch these maddened creatures

Like you the all once reached out

A war to win

But I'm gonna burn this vision down

Call me the father of lies

Just watch these saddened creatures

They've turned you into their savior

You hold your ground

Until your last breath

You'll twist, then turn

And now you're falling down

*The battle rages on*

And forever and ever

The wheel will turn

*Let ages come and go*

**The wheel will turn now**

*The wheel will turn*

**Another ride into obsession**

*I am reborn*

**The wheel will turn now**

(*The wheel will turn*)

**And I am driven to obsession**

All these dying men

Try to understand

They all followed the sign

It's a cycle's end

There's no hope

For a while

From the ashes arise

Can't save her

Enjoy the flames

So precious, so pure

And you try

You're sure to fail

And madness

Is the price you've to pay

Unholy grounds

Witness your last breath

The cycle ends

And you're stumbling

*The battle will go on*

*And forever and ever*

*It's raging on*

Let ages come and go

The wheel will turn now

*The wheel will turn*

Another ride into obsession

I am reborn

**The wheel will turn now**

And I am driven to obsession

Through the flames you'll see me

You'll be mine, believe me

This is the moment I long for

Wake up, there's a storm to face

And right now while the land lies bleeding

It's me, I conquer your soul

*Still I'll be on my way*

*Oh, light, let me out of here*

*I pray*

**And over and over and over again**

**There is no beginning**

No end

This war, it still goes on

And forever and ever

I will return

*Let ages come and go*

**The wheel will turn now**

*The wheel will turn*

**Another ride into obsession**

*I am reborn*

The wheel will turn now

And I am driven to obsession

*Light, so serene*

**True source reign over me**

*Light, so serene*

There's no end and

There's no beginning

You will never be alone

I enjoyed it more than TGS and ToM, so props to Sanderson.  Was it without flaws?  No.  But it was still amazing.  I'm glad we got to see the Jordan epilogue.  Here's a few random reactions/questions:

Demandred, finally.  And the wait was worth it; I will admit that I was actually pulling for Gawyn, which shocked me when I realized it.  I'm glad he failed, because it set up the Lan confrontation...amazing.

Since when can we tie off gateways?  I thought it was stated previously that this could not be done.  If it can, travelling grounds should have permanent tied-off gateways, channelers would never be complaining about being tired from holding gateways open too long, etc.  I do like that Sanderson expanded upon the use of gateways; they have so much potential that I felt was unused.

Did we finally see the sa'angreal that Lanfear hinted at to Rand?  She told him after he took Callandor that there were ""only two more powerful that a man can use.""  Was it Demandred's rod?

Holy shit, Min actually hit something with her knives!  This dulled the shock of Suian's death for me (the first one I really *felt*).  Good for you, Min.

Egwene.  Couldn't you have taken Elayne instead?  I mean I've never been a huge fan of Egwene, but can't we trade?

Mat bloody Cauthon.  He still has some of the over-the-top Sanderson-ness to him, but I think he toned it down in this book.  His battlefield duel with Demandred was amazing.  The fact that ""Wyld"" knows that it must be Lews Therin is great...another Forsaken underestimating the Third Agers.  And his and Rand's pissing contest over who is more awesome...so good.

I'm sad Bashere didn't make it.  That guy was one of my favorite minor characters.  Him telling Rand that he *might* want to think about not breaking the seals, his speech about how long it takes to bury 23 oak trees - great guy.  I'm actually OK with Faile surviving, after Perrin re-attained his awesomeness, he deserved it.  And she got way less bitchy towards the end anyway.  And Thom made it, so it's all good.

Finally, Rand and the Dark One.  I had no idea how that fight was going to be described, but I thought it was very well done.  I had theorized that the True Power would be used as a buffer to prevent the tainting of the One Power, and took a lot of shit for it (no way can he use the True Power against the Dark One!).  It was one of the very few of my predictions that was correct.

Some of the folks in Rand's school are touching on that, but since the humans who survived the Breaking weren't all exactly glue-eating morons, shouldn't steam power be old hat by now?

I just finished book 4 and holy crap was this book amazing. I only regret it took me so long to pick up the series at least at the rate I am going I will finish the series shortly after the final book is released.

Some notes I have made so far:

1)	Burn those bloody white cloaks, bunch of cowards and idiots!

2)	Perrin is easily my favorite character. His story line nearly brought me to tears twice in book 4. Loail would be a close second. Fitting for me that they are traveling together now.

3)	I have never trusted Thom Merrilin, not sure why but I feel there is a ton of back story on him that we have barely scratched the surface of.

4)	For being a former town wisdom, Nynaeve sure does walk right into a lot of traps. I guess the title doesn’t have anything to do with your intelligence level.

5)	As much as the women in the books like to think they are running things, they sure do follow the men.  Could just be the ta’veren thing though.

6)	Did I mention I really don’t like the white cloaks?

7)	Elaine and Min are 2 of the woman that Min saw surrounding Rand. I am not sure yet who the third is. I am thinking Egwene, Lanfear, or Aviendha. Lanfear seems like the easy answer but Rand doesn’t seem to care about her. He has feelings for both Min and Elaine.

8)	The siege of Tar Valon was heart wrenching as well. Black Ajah all of them.

9)	What happened to Uno and the rest of the Borderlanders? I might have missed 
something, but one minute they are with the group then it felt like they were just gone.
