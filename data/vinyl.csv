That's all really. Not looking for sympathy or anything... just wanted to share my story with the only vinyl community I am apart of. I thought ya'll would be proud of me. :)


EDIT: The reasoning boils down to sentiment. Nearly all of my records have sentimental value for various reasons.



EDIT: THE STORY

. The fire started in bastrop, which about 25 minutes east of austin.  I was in san antonio visiting at the time. I got the call that our neighborhood was being evacuated as the state park, and neighborhoods to the northeast of that were already on fire. This ended up being the biggest wildfire in Texas's recorded history. Over a thousand homes were lost. [this is a fire damage map](http://digitaltexan.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/bastrop-fire-map.jpg)

Sunday evening. Helpless, I called my roommate who was on the way home from work in austin. He didn't know yet. I told him about the evacuation. They were not letting people into the neighborhood now... just getting them out. I told him about a way I know through the forest. He parked at the hospital and followed the deer trail/path of least resistance I had discovered by walking home from work one day. He made it to the house, got our guitars and his dog, hopped on his bike, rode out of the neighborhood and down the highway back to his car. My dog was with me in san an, thankfully. Police were driving around with their loudspeakers evacuating everyone. He goes and stays at a friend's house.

Cut to sunday morning. I'm feeling wretched. If I don't try to get back, I will regret it forever. I had bought the mountain bike i had been saving up for for months on saturday afternoon. I strapped my bike to my car and headed for bastrop... about an hour and half away from where I was in san an. My roommate had to work, my girlfriend kept my dog in san an so this was a solo mission. As I got close, it looked like armageddon. seriously just fucking crazy. I'll post pictures here after this, if anyone is interested. Anyways, the highway was closed at the hospital as I had suspected. I parked at the hospital and hopped on my bike. 

About 10 to 15 minutes later, I make it to the house. The neighborhood was like 28 days later... just completely barren. The fire was to my east. I got in the door and was shaking with adrenaline. My heart was racing. The first thing thing i did was grab my camel bak and filled it up with ice and water (brita). I should mention that all the power and water had been turned off by this point. I grabbed a big duffel bag that was filled with clothes I longer wear and dumped them on my bed. I then opened my record chest and began packing them into the duffel. I emptied my backpack on the floor and began stuffing records in there. I went to my roommates room and grabbed some photos off the wall and his camera in its back. I then realized that I'm terrible at the ""what would you grab in a fire scenario"" so i figured I better get out of there. I strapped everything on my shoulders and walked my bike outside. Fuck, it was so heavy. The duffel bag, camelbak, backpack, camera bag. It was incredibly awkward. Bastrop is in the hill country, so my neighborhood street looks like a roller coaster. By the time I made it to the front entrance of my neighborhood I laid down my bike and unloaded my shoulders. I felt like I was going to have a heart attack with all the adrenaline, the up and down ride with the weight on my shoulders. It took me about 20 minutes to catch my breath. I loaded up again and rode to my car down the highway. I was filmed by a lot of bystanders riding out of my neighborhood with all the stuff on my shoulders. I emptied the bags into my car (which was park in the shade and not too hot). I loaded the empty bags up and hit the forest again. Repeat that whole adventure once more. I figured that would be it for me, and I didn't think that the fire would actually make it to our house.  Then my phone died. Not wanting to move my car, I rode my bike all the way into town to wal mart, and picked up a mobile charger. Rode back to my car and charged up. Bystanders were just stopped on the highway and hundreds of people were just helplessly watching in horror and shock.  By this time, I just wanted to know how that house was so back in the forest I went. Made it to the house and the choppers were now flying directly over my house on their route to drop water and solution. That was really scary. On the way out the third time, i took the way back through the forest instead of the front of the neighborhood. This includes a downhill dirt road. I ate shit. just completely busted my ass. Luckily I didnt break anything, but I scraped my knee up really badly. I made it to the car, caught my breath and then rode to my office to see if it was on fire as smoke was coming from that direction . It was fine so I went in, and refilled my camelbak. Rode back to my car at the hospital and loaded up. I just sat and stared at the smoke after that. The hospital is directly to the right off the highway [in this picture]( http://99dzh.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/t1larg.bastrop.fire_.raci_.jpg) across the street from the super 8. Not my picture. I'm on my work computer right now. About a half hour later, I left and headed back to san an. I was completely depleted. 

The next day, I moved to a hotel room in austin with my coworkers and we set up a temporary office in hotel so we could be operational. We have a web based business. I anxiously waited for any news on our house and whole area as updates happened. I found out my house had been confirmed gone on thursday. My efforts totally paid off. It was the craziest experience of my life. I'm still in a hotel in austin, and re rentry to bastrop are happening this week. I will be in a hotel until i find a new place to live in austin. And thats the story. I apologize for any grammar or typos as I wrote this very fast.

This sub is always willing to help, I've found, and there is a great community of folks who actually put a great deal of effort into helping others. 

However, I've noticed that those new to the sub *and* to collecting and/or just listening to vinyl seem to be going out of their way to attack others whenever possible. You don't have to ""cringe"" at how someone is stacking their records, or tell them they need to move their speakers in posts where they state that they're doing the best they can with the space they have. There's no need to tell anyone their taste in music sucks, and there's no need to discourage or disparage anyone for any reason at all here. 

Perhaps there's a ""hipster"" factor here: ""I've been collecting for two weeks longer than you, so I'm awesome and amazing and you suck."" If so, that really sucks. 

I subscribe to very few subs, and I'm a member of this one because I enjoy vinyl culture. Vinyl culture is about being helpful, and it's about enjoying music in whatever form you choose to enjoy it. 

This sub is about 90% civil, which is far and away a lot better than most subs on Reddit, so cheers to all of you who help to make this an amazing community for all of us and seem to understand that for each username there is a human being. Thanks for the help and support you lend to me and others.

* When looking at used equipment you don't know anything about, do a google search. If nothing pops up on AudioKarma or other forums about it, then it's probably not that great
* When searching on Craigslist, also check common misspellings. reciever instead of receiver might turn up something that's been overlooked.

* A small piece of Mr Clean Magic Eraser is perfect for cleaning dust off your stylus. Just gently touch the stylus to it. You could glue part of the eraser to a coin to give it some weight.

However, the two most recommended places online are [bagsunlimited](https://www.bagsunlimited.com/c-57-audio.aspx) and [sleevecity](http://www.sleevecityusa.com/record-sleeves-s/1828.htm). I personally prefer Sleeve City, but whatever. They usually have a 15% off code floating around somewhere, and if you can ship to a business instead of a residence, you could save a few bucks too. My favorites for cost/quality are the [resealable 3 mil outer sleeve](http://www.sleevecityusa.com/resealable-3-mil-outer-lp-sleeves-pack-of-50-p/9222.htm) and some [Disckeeper inners](http://www.sleevecityusa.com/Diskeeper-2-0-Antistatic-Record-Sleeves-p/9235.htm). Another great option from Amazon that has Prime shipping are [these 3 mil outers](http://www.amazon.com/INDUSTRY-STANDARD-Plastic-Sleeves-12SE03/dp/B000RA7IZS/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1375060617&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=record+sleeve) (nonresealable, but cheaper than Sleeve City). I don't buy anything less than disckeepers for my inners if I value the record. 80's hair metal can get the paper sleeves though. Whatever you do, don't skimp on your outer sleeves, cheap ones can split easily, are ""crinkly"", and just don't feel as good as nicer ones.

I'm really glad that you're collecting vinyl.    

I'm not one for rants about sound quality or the inherent superiority of the format, but I do think it's great that people are choosing to pay for music and participate in a meaningful interaction with that music, as well as engaging in that thrill of the hunt and discovery of new things.     

I personally try to balance out my greedy torrent thievery with spending too much money on records. It gets me out in the world. It introduces me to actual living, breathing people, and it helps me find music I'd never run into if I were relying on programmed taste aggregators online.     

But maybe don't post your entire collection online, complete with your $0.50 Beatles scuffs. It degrades the sub.    

Sure, this happens elsewhere, but it's getting to be pretty overwhelming. Imagine every discussion in /r/literature was like ""I've been reading for six months but look at what I've gotten!"" and it was just pictures of used copies of Ulysses and Jonathan Livingston Seagull and Dianetics. Don't get me wrong: I'm glad you're collecting. I really am. But come on. It's kind of a hostile act to post pictures of sixty records so I have to go and sort through and find something worthwhile in the post.    

The rules are clear in the sidebar: say something about the records. Don't just post pictures of them. Otherwise, this sub's just the equivalent of those shitty ""haul"" videos on Youtube, but more repetitive.",,False,self,t5_2qh7i,False,,,True,t3_1d7uyd,http://www.reddit.com/r/vinyl/comments/1d7uyd/a_few_words_about_your_collection/,

1350400595.0,324,self.vinyl,11kn0j,"Using PhotoShop to make informed vinyl purchases online (eBay, etc...)",348,24,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/vinyl/comments/11kn0j/using_photoshop_to_make_informed_vinyl_purchases/,"Buying vinyl online, most of know, is sometimes a game of chance. Seller feedback ratings can be deceiving at times, as many sellers who have any kind of issue with a buyer, resulting in a returned record, will often withhold their feedback and cancel a transaction, so it doesn't affect their score. Usually, a long history of positive ratings is a strong indicator, but it never hurts to do some investigating. If you have a copy of PhotoShop (Ps), no matter how archaic, and depending on the supplied photography of the vinyl being sold, you can make much more informed decisions before buying online. It's actually easy...  

[**Here's an eBay listing for a typical copy of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band&gt;**](http://i.imgur.com/zctY2.png)  
There are multiple photographs of the record for sale, even close-ups of the vinyl itself. That's great. In many cases, such listings on eBay include the ""zoom"" function for viewing the photos at a very large size on the screen, and that often reveals a good amount of detail concerning condition. The larger the original photo, the better. This isn't the case here, but the photos offer information.  

The problem (mainly for buyers, of course) with photographing vinyl is, it's hard to photograph something that is black *and* shiny and still capture the actual surface of the record unless you understand manual photography. In fact, the shine (""luster,"" ""gloss,"" whatever you want to call it) of a record - which often remains a characteristic of the vinyl regardless of surface marks, unless the record is very, very worn - can be misleading as to its true condition. A camera's automatic exposure factors mostly in the highlights, and a lot of information remains buried in the shadows. So how can you see what's really going on in a seller's photos? Ps offers a lot of options.  

One of the easiest ways is a simple levels adjustment. If you drag a photo in Ps, go to your menu to Image &gt; Adjustments &gt; Levels (Command+L is the shortcut).  

[**Here is one of the detail shots from the listing dragged in to Ps, Levels palette opened&gt;**](http://i.imgur.com/k7Mlc.png)  

Those circled triangles at the bottom are called sliders, and they denote the black, gray and white level points within the exposure of an image. If you drag those sliders around, you can adjust these levels and uncover details that are obscured by darkness, shadow.  

[**Here's the same image with the black and gray levels adjusted&gt;**](http://i.imgur.com/2UvsF.png)  

You can see much more of the surface and what imperfections exist, and where you previously relied only on the description of the record in the listing, now you have a better understanding of what you're bidding on.  

I do this all the time. Here's an actual record I bought from an eBay seller not too long ago.  

*Bird and Diz*, Mercury 10 inch, MG C-512. Pretty rare and really valuable if in great condition.  

[**Before PhotoShop&gt;**](http://i.imgur.com/69yuR.jpg)  

[**After a quick levels adjustment&gt;**](http://i.imgur.com/UvbUN.jpg)  

Pretty dramatic difference. I questioned the seller about the condition of the record, and he stuck to his ""VG"" grade. I took a chance, knowing that it was probably worse than that, but I ended up winning the auction for $30. Upon receiving the record, it was obviously a low ""Good"" condition (being generous) – that huge mark on it is this strange webbed streak, like the baked earth of a desert floor. It plays with a ton of noise, but it's a cool record anyway. (The seller was actually nice enough to refund my money and let me keep the record, being as trashed as it is.) Anyway...   

If images on a screen are all you have to go by when making a decision, a little more information about what you've set your sights on is never a bad thing. I hope this tip comes in handy for some of you.

Most of my customers are young guys, in their 20s or 30s.  I've often noticed that if they have a question about their equipment or about record collecting in general - they wait until my husband's not around and sheepishly ask me.  I feel like it's because young guys are afraid to approach THE RECORD STORE clerk if he's a man and appear not to know much about stereos or how to clean records, etc.

I want to do a youtube series of 2 or 3 minute instructional videos of me explaining shit.  So far, I thought

*how to hook up a turntable 

*how to balance a tone arm

*how to clean your records

*how to replace a belt + how to replace a stylus

*how to splice speaker wire together

*When/why you need a preamp

Hear me out, I'm trying to help.",286,42,79,http://www.reddit.com/r/vinyl/comments/shqx0/your_setup_sucks_hear_me_out_im_trying_to_help/,"I see too many people posting their setups showing off some of the worst possible speaker placements I've ever seen.  I posted this in reply to one of those threads, but I thought I'd create a new thread so more people might see it.

Some major problems I see all too often on [/r/vinyl](/r/vinyl):

1. Your speakers are way too close together.  You've got no soundstage.
1. Your speakers are right up against the walls, and surrounded on each side.  Again, this affects the soundstage, but also heavily affects the bass.
1. Your speakers are right next to the turntable. The vibrations will heavily distort the music.

Go read [this guide to speaker placement](http://www.gcaudio.com/resources/howtos/speakerplacement.html) and look at some of the [diagrams here](http://www.dolby.com/us/en/consumer/setup/connection-guide/home-theater-speaker-guide/index.html).  (The second one is more for ""home theater"" setups, but much of it still applies.)

You are not getting the most out of what you have.  You'll be surprised how much *better* things sound if you follow some of these tips.  You don't need to measure everything out obsessively, just follow some basic tips:

1. Move your speakers apart.  A rough guide is they should be about as far away from each other as the distance from you to them.
1. Keep your speakers away from the walls, give them a little space.
1. Speakers should be approximately ear level.

I really hope this info helps some of you.

We've been looking around casually for 45's to play in a jukebox for our wedding reception, so when we go, we sometimes get the wedding bug and peruse the 45's for a long while, hoping to find some gems. It's taxing, considering most vendors don't like organizing 45's because, well, it sucks (that's just how I would feel having to organize 45's anyway). Although at this show, an older gentleman had his 45's organized with colored sleeves by genre, and it was just beautiful. So, we thought it was worth it to rifle through the 45's. 

We talked with him for a long while about how we're getting married and our plans for our music situation, and other vendors/customers were listening in and giving us great ideas (throwing 45s our way, literally), and some pretty funny ones (Poison Love, Another One Bites The Dust, etc). We also talked with several people about how temperamental jukeboxes can be, so we may change our minds and stick with a regular turntable. Eventually, we did find some great picks. When we got around to paying him, the man said, ""Well, you're getting married, right?"" and handed us the records, free of charge, and said, ""I hope you two have a wonderful life."" 

I suppose that's our first wedding present, and it's the best one I can imagine receiving from a fellow vinyl enthusiast.

1366557017.0,189,self.vinyl,1csvog,This is how Record Store Day SHOULD be done,245,56,107,http://www.reddit.com/r/vinyl/comments/1csvog/this_is_how_record_store_day_should_be_done/,"I keep reading posts about people’s experiences at Record Store Day and there seem to be a troubling amount of stories about people shoving , rushing for shelves to find stuff or buying more than one copy. 

I’m fortunate enough that my local store handles Record Store Day pretty much perfectly, I wouldn’t have participated the last 4 years if it was ever like people on this subreddit are describing.
To give a quick rundown of how Record Store Day SHOULD be done based on how my local store does it:

• People form an orderly line outside the shop before it opens, they generally know what number in line they are. The staff of the store have left some cookies, games, modelling clay, bubble blowers, newspapers/magazines and other entertainments outside the store to keep those in line entertained. Some promo guys hand out free bacon sandwiches, a Brazillian TV station has showed up and someone else is making a documentary about the whole thing.

• The staff come out before opening and give everyone a numbered ticket so they and you know exactly what number in the queue you are. They also hand out up-to-date lists of exactly what they have and what things cost. They also give goodie bags full of vinyl, CDs, T-Shirts, Badges, Balloons, Posters etc. To the first 50 or so people in line (the people right at the front get more/better goodie bags)

• At 7am the store opens but the tills don’t, everybody files in and, in order, tells the staff what they want to buy (or hands over their highlighted list) – none of the records are on the shelves but are on visible display on every wall with the rest of the stock behind the counter. You hand over your list and they create a pile of what you want.

• At 8am the tills open and they ring up the first 20 or so people who got their stacks ready, then they start taking the orders from the rest of the line by calling out ticket number, if two people want the last copy of something we check ticket numbers and whomever was first gets it

• No pre-orders, no online-sales, you cannot buy multiple copies of any of the RSD releases no matter how well you know the staff or even if you ARE staff

• As things are allocated and sell out the staff announce to the line what has gone and take the final copy from the display wall - this part is a bit unpleasant if you’re just praying the people in front don’t buy things you want (I was so sad to miss out on the Hold Steady 7” and the Black Keys/Stooges split)

• In the afternoon there’s a party, free beer and wine and the numbered queue ticket you were given becomes a raffle ticket for prizes – gig tickets, DVDs, signed records, gift vouchers etc. – this year they had a signed Postal Service vinyl box set, a Parquet Courts test pressing, art prints and tons of other things. About a third of the people there won something.

• After that there’s an in-store performance by a band who then sell their RSD release and sign copies (This year it was Tom Odell who recorded a bunch of covers for an EP, made 50 copies and sold all of them at the store – literally the only place you could by that record)


My local store has operated this system the last 4 years and because of it they get massive queues of people who travel huge distances to participate (they also get a LOT of stock in, including imports from the US RSD) – this year there were two women who started waiting at 7pm the night before! I got there at 3am and was 34th in line. A lot of the people are there every year (including me) and because there’s no worry about queue-jumpers or people grabbing things you might want everyone’s friendly, has a drink and a laugh while they wait. It is a genuinely lovely experience where you get to meet people with similar interest and have fun talking about music. One year there were some eBayers but they were socially shunned and went elsewhere this time round. Thanks to this brilliant system I spend far more money than I otherwise would on awesome records every year.

So my question is why on Earth are other record stores doing such a poor job of this?",,False,self,t5_2qh7i,1366575298.0,,,True,t3_1csvog,http://www.reddit.com/r/vinyl/comments/1csvog/this_is_how_record_store_day_should_be_done/,

1369585701.0,183,self.vinyl,1f34ox,My thoughts on Vinyl - a 57 year old perspective.,201,18,47,http://www.reddit.com/r/vinyl/comments/1f34ox/my_thoughts_on_vinyl_a_57_year_old_perspective/,"I’ve noticed that my preferences for listening have evolved with the advent of playlist enabled equipment. I don’t think this is a bad thing, it’s just a thing.

I was a radio announcer for 13 years, a music director in a major market for 8 and a collector of vinyl since I purchased my first 45 (Bob Seeger System - Ramblin Gamblin' Man) at the age of 13. I first heard the Beatles at age 9 on my sisters 45 player. I currently have a library of about 2500 LP's. All original editions, many from radio station libraries.

Yet, I’m no vinyl snob. I don’t advocate that one sound is any better than another, and I’ve listened to all of it. I’ve listened to digital in its best audiophile presentation (I run an sl1200 into an HK Citation 11 and an MC7270 power amp - through Vandersteens), most iterations (local files, streamed, compressed, lossless, run through DAC into headphones, and audiophile room-filling power juggernauts), and I’ve listened to Vinyl in the same light. There are great presentations from both camps, and there are many examples of crap recording and worse delivery.

But the difference that means the most to me isn’t some ‘warm sound’ phenomenon, or any claim to superior auditory senses. In fact I know my high end to be a little the other side of 14khz (I have tested this recently with a frequency generator and a very reliable set of headphones at reasonably ridiculous volume).

The difference to me is in how the songs are presented. The order of presentation. Vinyl has only one setting; play. I can’t remember if there was much bother way back when, if a shitty song came up on the album (I can’t think of one record that didn’t have one. No question.). But you’d let it play through unless you were right there at the turntable, and even then, to lift the needle could be a risky thing in company. It all depended on the people, the song, the level of intoxicants in the bloodstream, etc. Usually it would go by, a maximum 6 minute commitment. There are exceptions of course, but if you’re listening to In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida, presumably you’re doing it on purpose; you can see the investment before you drop the needle.

Now, I have been trained by my digital devices to listen to only the cream. The songs that come up on the playlist have all been put there for one reason or another. And regardless of the amount time passed since the construction of that playlist, the reasons still stand. I can hear Lightfoot sing “Steel Rail Blues” and be happy with a segue into Feist, Zero 7, Winehouse or even Coltrane.

Whereas now, when I start an LP, I have trouble letting it play through. I’m impatient for a perfect song; for a well-crafted song, one that meets my standards. Anything even slightly less has me impatient for a greater level of quality.

All the tunes in rotation on my playlists meet those standards, few on vinyl do. This is a K-Tel moment. They used to do this for pop music and make millions. AM radio played the hits; FM went deep into album cuts.

The last vestige of this was a game I used to play late night after the bars with people who were musically motivated. It happened naturally. You select a cut to demonstrate some impression, feeling or make a point from earlier in the evening. The selection suggests the next selection in some concocted demonstration of synchronicity generated by the mind of the participants. Two, three or four people sharing a train of thought that diverges instantly with thought or suggestion into something different; yet something meeting the aficionado’s definition of quality.

“Great sound! Who does that with a Guitar? How can he do that? Here’s where that melody came from. Remember this?” The possibilities were endless and mostly educational. Those evenings could go on for a long time. Collective playlists – they can’t happen with pockets full of iPod.

So, something has disappeared, but I think potential is still there. In my home, I’m alone at the turntable. There is no one else who is even comfortable using the equipment.

So I have decided to find a couple of cheap turntables, a couple of cheap needle/cartridge combos and a couple of cheap amplifiers. I already have enough speakers to fill the house. I’m going to setup a listening station in each of my kid’s bedrooms. My son is 15 and my daughter is 12. I’m going to let them have access to my Vinyl collection and I’m going to hope that something happens.

That’s all I’ve got.

TL;DR - Gonna let my kids have access to my library.",,False,self,t5_2qh7i,False,,,True,t3_1f34ox,http://www.reddit.com/r/vinyl/comments/1f34ox/my_thoughts_on_vinyl_a_57_year_old_perspective/,

1345768261.0,180,self.vinyl,yq5yi,Recently inherited this record collection...,195,15,90,http://www.reddit.com/r/vinyl/comments/yq5yi/recently_inherited_this_record_collection/,"quick backstory: My grandfather recently got dementia, and was admitted to a nursing home. I've only met him once or twice, when I was young and could barely remember. The only things I ever heard about him were that he Drank A LOT (and was violent as a result), and that he liked collecting records.
so I didn't think much of it when he was admitted to the nursing home earlier this year, until my dad told me that none of his other siblings wanted to house the records, so they would be going to us. again I thought nothing of it, because my aunts and uncles live in smaller homes.
Over the summer we slowly moved the records from my grandpas old house to our own. It took around four trips. He lived 8 hours away, so this took a while.

Apparently, my grandpa loved records when he bought them, but then basically lost all affection for them. According to my dad, when he was a kid, records literally littered the house, stacked utop each other in the basement, kitchen, dining room... hell he even had an entire room that had nothing in it but boxes of records sitting on the ground. As far as organizing them, we were on our own. we got shelving out the wazoo. like, I'm pretty sure my younger sister thinks the daycare at Ikea is her new official daycare. Dunno how much shelving you guys are used to seeing, but this was just an overload. 

you could probably make a living by taking a couple of my grandpas vinyls, and just re-selling them to him. There was no way he ever knew what he did or didn't have, he just bought. so my dad decided to cataloge all of them in excel.
And thats why I picked today to share this with you folks, we just recently got through around 95% of them. my grandma literally flew accross the country to help out, but it's finally done. So here is the Actual collection


http://imgur.com/a/I1lM5 


and here is the excel file, hosted on some website. http://www.filedropper.com/recordcollectionmaster


so as you might have guessed, my dad and I are basically Noobs. we don't know shit about vinyls. Thats partially why I wanted to share them with you(the other part being because I just think you'd appreciate it). Everything in the setup/speaker system or whatever is all just ripped right outta my grampa's garage and crudely hooked up. So, r/vinyl, what do you think? what should we do to improve our listening experience? what should we do to learn? What should we know? let me know.

I should probably also note that my grandpa was a crazed Frank Sinatra fan. Apparently he boasted to owning every single album/single ever released by him ever. which, you should be able to see in The Cataloge. It's a lot.

Edit: that file Hoster is kinda Ickey... anyone know a better version?

EDIT2: http://dropcanvas.com/09vbp

EDIT EDIT::: So I hear, the next step in the master plan was to find out the prices of the ""RARE"" or ""Not Available"". SOOO if any of Ya'll know some prices of those albums off the top of your head, feel free to let me know here or PM me about it!

1330170120.0,172,self.vinyl,q5d7v,Inspecting used vinyl: What to look for.,191,19,43,http://www.reddit.com/r/vinyl/comments/q5d7v/inspecting_used_vinyl_what_to_look_for/,"I’ve found you can get great LP’s on a budget if you’re meticulous about inspecting them. Here’s how I go about it. 

**Pull LP’s without inspecting them.** Flip and pull, flip and pull. Inspecting quality while you’re digging is strictly amateursville; it means others can’t flip the bin while you’re peeping at wax. You’ll inspect your finds later and do a much better job. Plus if the bins are popular you’ll get through them quicker and grab the good stuff before others do. It just looks badass to pull a big stack of cool titles after barely looking at them. (Downside: if you’re at a record store people may think you work there.)

If there are multiple copies of a title you want, be sure to grab all of them! Each one you grab raises the likelihood that you'll get a good one. 

**Set up shop.** Look up and find the brightest, most intense light you can find, then plop down right under it and go through your stack. If all the light’s the same, look for a quiet part of the store and do your inspection there. If you’re at a swap or yard sale, plop down on the ground crosslegged with your stack in front of you. Relax, this will take a few minutes. 

**Unsleeve the record.** Pay attention to orientation and condition of the innersleeve. If the mouth of the innersleeve is facing out, same direction as the jacket’s mouth, that’s common but not ideal (means the record’s been pulled in and out a lot, both by owners and shoppers). If the mouth is up, “locking” the record in the sleeve, that’s better, suggesting the last owner was conscientious. If there are no seam rips on the innersleeve in the common 3, 6, and 9 o’clock positions, the record has probably not been played much, which is great. If the innersleeve clings to the record slightly as you pull it out, that indicates the record hasn’t been pulled out much and is fairly dust-free. 

If there is no innersleeve, that’s unfortunate; the record has likely been abused by the lack of protection. Still you can find records in fine shape even without innersleeves maybe 5% of the time. Not sure how this is possible but it is. (Consider borrowing a generic innersleeve from another record in the bins to protect your find.)

**First impressions.** Even before you look for scratches, pay attention to the luster of the record: does it look beautiful, with the iridescence of the grooves giving a sense of depth, kind of like “space tape” laser-etched foil? If so, this is very promising, and could mean a M- album. (A worn album will look flat, “dead,” or greyish.) Even better is to see a record with tiny paper “hairs” clinging to it, by-products of manufacturing the innersleeve. These are only present the first few times a record’s removed from a sleeve and are soon dusted off or blown away. This is rare, but thrilling when it happens. Little hairs, woo-hoo!

**Dirty records.** The first thing you’ll usually see before scratches is dust or dirt clinging to the record. Assuming you have a good cleaner such as a Spin Clean or VPI, this shouldn’t be a problem. But note that some dirty patches can conceal micro-scratches beneath. Also, what look like dirt spots can sometimes be little scratch zones, where grit has rubbed against the same small area, creating nasty squiggles. If in doubt about whether a record can be cleaned, put a few drops of water from your water bottle onto a fingertip and rub the record, drying it with the hem of your shirt. (Some desperate souls might use saliva, but not me. Hardly ever.)

**Gimme a disc with hair.** Sometimes what appear to be scratches can be hairs, usually pet but also human I guess. I’m always happy to find these hairy albums, because the hairs can fool record buyers into thinking the disc is thrashed when it may be in great shape, and they'll price it cheaply. 

**Look for scratches.** The nasty, noisy “deal-breaker” gouges will be obvious at first glance. (But don’t discard the LP yet, some may be scuffs; see below.) Less obvious will be the myriad mini- or micro-scratches present on most used records. Orient your record so the bright light source above you is blocked out by the label, and all scratches will become blindingly apparent. In ambient lighting conditions (most common), just keep shifting the record’s orientation until you see some scratches. (Redditor e-cow suggests using a mini Maglite flashlight at a 45-degree angle to highlight worn groove surfaces; light from directly above can tend to illuminate the untouched groove bottoms rather than the angled play surfaces.) 

Keep a cynical frame of mind; I always tend to think, “Look how clean this is!” and have to force myself to be critical by saying, “Look how scratchy this is!"" Sometimes out loud. I get weird looks. Whatever. 

**Check the edges.** Since that's where the stylus hits first, a lot of damage to LP's can happen in the first half-minute of a side. Pull the record ALL the way out of the sleeve, not just 90% of the way, and check the perimeter carefully. Too often do I put the needle on what I thought was a ""perfect"" copy to hear some confounded clicking. 

**Touch me, baby.** The old record collector’s axiom “if you feel it, you’ll hear it” is pretty reliable (but not quite foolproof). Run your finger across any questionable gouges. If your fingertip doesn’t feel it, your stylus may not either. (It may take a few trials to calibrate your fingertip vs. stylus sensitivity, though.)

**Crossing the rubicon.** Does a scratch cross the banding between tracks? This is helpful. Does the scratch actually cut into the dead wax, or does it disappear and pick up where the music grooves resume? If the latter, the scratch may not be deep enough to cause problems. 

**Scratches that skip.** By far the worst scratches are the ones that run diagonally, almost parallel to the grooves. These camouflaged gouges are the ones most likely to make your needle skip ahead or play the same few notes over and over. These lateral nasties are the “black ice” of used vinyl, hard to see and deadly when you hit ‘em. Keep your eyes peeled. 

**Scratches or scuffs?** Not all marks on records are audible (in everyday listening on average equipment). If you see a mark that’s wider than the point of a pin, you may be in luck; it could be a very shallow scuff instead of a scratch. Scuffs can be anywhere from 1/16” to 1/2 “. Scuffs may look awful but are seldom as problematic as scratches. (I bought a cheap copy of Thriller in apparently great shape and was horrified to find what looked like a screwdriver gouge across one track. But I couldn’t hear it in playback. Lucky!)

I’m always happy to find scuffed records in the cheapo bins, figuring buyers thought these were unplayable and discarded them. 

**When to be a bitch about scratches.** Know your music. Music with sustained tones or quiet dynamics, such as acoustic folk, ambient, or classical, will sound terrible with even minor scratches in them, so be picky. Conversely, the volume and percussion of a loud rock or funk album will mask the scratches better. Also, consider the album side duration. Longer sides over 22 minutes (such as K-Tel compilations) will be microgrooved and cut pretty shallow, so almost any visible scratch will be audible. Conversely, short LP sides, especially those from the 1960’s, will be cut very deep, so visible scratches might not be heard. (I have a thrashed copy of More of the Monkees on Colgems that looks awful but sounds just fine.)

**Look for warps.** I should do this with every record I buy, but few turn out to be warped, so I don’t. Sometimes the records will just feel wrong or look distorted, so check ‘em out if they do. To inspect, hold the record at eye level and look laterally across the surface, from the near edge to the spindle hole. If the far edge “waves” above or below the surface, you’ve probably got a warp. Rotate the record 90° and try again. (Note that some very thin vinyl pressings, such as RCA Dynaflex from the 1970’s, will droop a bit while being inspected, so don’t be too hasty with these.)

**Check for heat damage.** Some records that have been exposed to heat will exhibit damage, usually just along one edge. This is not merely cosmetic; it will cause a nasty “whooshing” sound when playing, so avoid. Look for a “foamy” or pockmarked texture along one edge and extending an inch or two towards the middle. Usually this will be accompanied by minor warping or fluting along that edge. This isn’t too common but it’s definitely out there, so be vigilant. 

**If possible, give it a spin.** Though this is a guide on visual evaluation, there’s no substitute for dropping the needle on suspect vinyl. If you go to swaps or yard sales a lot, bring your portable, battery-operated turntable or consider buying one. Don’t forget the headphones! If you’re in a good used record store, they’ll have listening stations with turntables for you to use, so definitely take advantage. Note problematic areas—“end of track 2 and middle of track 5”—and listen to those in particular. Always listen to every record you’re considering buying. Some that look scratch-free may have still been played to death. 

**About covers.** Cover grading is its own art and one I tend to ignore; as long as there’s a jacket I’m happy. Be aware that torn or split jackets can be nicely repaired with acid-free tape. I wouldn’t do this with any high-value records, but for dollar-bin beater albums, why not. 

**Throw the bad ones back.** It can be heartbreaking to put a beloved album that’s not up to snuff back in the bins, but it has to be done. (Still smarting over that thrashed dollar copy of Pink Floyd’s “A Nice Pair.”) I usually say something like, “This great album deserves better,” and then bid the title adieu: “We’ll meet again, my friend, on some other day.”

Will send free copies to r/vinyl subscribers (PLEASE READ),170,34,143,http://www.reddit.com/r/vinyl/comments/1b42tv/releasing_my_first_12_record_will_send_free/,"**EDIT:** Thank thank thank you so much for the excellent response. I got a shit ton of replies, so I decided to do 50 free copies. I messaged everyone who will be getting a free copy.  We only pressed 300, and we want to sell 200 of them to make our money back and pay for the next pressing and the next album.  This will be available for sale for $10 plus shipping on our bandcamp soon, but I'm going to wait until everyone gets their records before I post a followup. I'll start shipping them out tomorrow and I'll PM all recipients a tracking number when their order ships.**Edit**
  
I’m aiming to connect this record with people who will enjoy it. I consider my band to be a punk band (ethically for sure), but our sound might be better described as hard rock/alt-rock with punk influences and elements of pop, grunge, metal, instrumental and psychedelic rock. Emphasis is on songwriting for sure. The songs are melodic. Many of the tracks are reverb-heavy. I wouldn't quite call it lo-fi, but it’s in the homemade neighborhood. I think it is fucking rad. Guitar, bass, drums, vocals.  
  
Side A is a concept album about the Mexican-American War. Side B contains 6 singles from various recording sessions. 12 songs total, just over 38 minutes. Our band is totally obscure, has up to this point been a recording project. We want to book shows to promote this record. We very much want to tour as well. We want to make more records. We do have an online presence, but I’d like your first listening experience to be with your record player, so I’m not going to mention the band’s name in this thread. We live in various cities in Colorado.  
  
If this sounds like something you’re likely to enjoy, please PM me with your name and address and I will ship you 1 copy via USPS Media Mail totally free of charge. Please agree to the following conditions:  
  
1. You will listen to it at least 2 times beginning to end.  
  
2. You will play it loud.  
  
I’ll send free copies to at least the first 20 replies, maybe more depending on the response. Due to shipping costs, I can only afford to do this for addresses in the USA, but if you’re international and want one, please PM me and I can send you my PayPal info and we can work out the shipping costs. I definitely want to connect with international people.  
  
I'm poor and insanely busy, but I promise to ship them all out within 1 week. I'll PM you a tracking number upon shipment as well.

I love it.  I'm interested in seeing what people like.  I'm interested in buying what people post about that I'm interested in (That post about Goat's *World Music* a week or so back made me open my wallet so fast the moths didn't have a chance to fly out).  Keep it up.  Post your hauls.  Post your Cure test-pressing finds.  Post that DSOTM that you found for *only* $25.  Post that false-economy Pitchfork fodder that you found out about six months too late, and so overpaid for it.  Post that false-economy Pitchfork fodder that you found out about two years too late, and so underpaid for it.  Keep it coming.  This is a fun hobby, and it's great to have a forum to brag about it in.


More importantly, though, this subreddit seems to be in the business of finding decent hifi equipment for cheap.  /r/audiophile is all about headphones lately.  That's cool, but if you want speakers and a turntable and an amp that sounds cool but you only have the money from that recently sold Crosley to spend?  You come here.  That's why this is an important thing.  Budget hifi. Here is where you learn that a $40 thrift store Dual is on par with that fancy new budget audiophile deck.  Here is where you figure out that toeing in your speakers some and buying heavy drapes is more important than having a tube preamp. Here's where you learn to get accurate sound on the cheap.  That rules.  The hifi world is so inundated with crazy expensive concept models that it's easy to think that good stereo is about tons of money. This is where you go to learn how to do the best you can with what you've got.  You can afford a Linn-Sondek?  Rad!  Post it!  We'll drool over it.  You can only afford a busted LP60 but have a hundred bucks to get it to sound good?  Rad!  Post it!  We'll help you out (after you check the sidebar).  That's the cool here. That's why this one I check the most often. 

It's important to let people know that music can sound better, can be more visceral, than a shitty low-bitrate CBR .mp3 through a pair of Skullcandy earbuds. Going vinyl, I think, is a good gateway to that. Vinyl doesn't, of course, intrinsically sound better than digital sources, but people willing to buy a setup are easily willing to buy a decent setup.  That opens ears.  Good sound, after all, sounds good.  And it's important for music to sound good.  Sound more-or-less accurate.  Because usually, a little bit of accuracy goes a long way towards hitting you in the viscera. And there's something about this medium that makes people gravitate towards that.  That rules. There's something about this medium that makes people listen more actively.  It's probably the ritual/assache of putting the record on, cleaning it, and dropping the needle that, by virtue of that action, prompts you to listen to it more closely.  But it works.  That's why vinyl sounds better: you have to work a little to listen to it, so you listen more closely. You don't have to flip a hard drive full of FLACs.  But you do a record.  So we care about this music thing. So when duder posts here about getting that one King Crimson album with the face on it, that's cool.  s/he is doing it right.

TL:DR Goat's *World Music* rules, and I was hipped to it from this subreddit, and I like good sound, and I'm drunk.

1345559086.0,123,self.vinyl,ykxcc,Ten ways to explain to your parents or significant other what happened to your Crosley.,160,37,58,http://www.reddit.com/r/vinyl/comments/ykxcc/ten_ways_to_explain_to_your_parents_or/,"Problem with Crosleys (and other cheap all-in-one players) is not only that they're substandard, but that owning one is actually blocking you from buying or asking for a decent turntable and system: ""why do you need a player, I/we just got you one?"" So getting rid of your Crosley, or having it somehow disappear, might be half the battle. Here are some suggested excuses: 

1) **""I dreamed a vampire was climbing in my window so I threw something to stop him and it turned out to be the Crosley.""** (Useful if your room is a story or two up, and the ground below is concrete. Open window first, and don't hit passersby.)

2) **""I smelled smoke and saw a bright flash and then it just stopped working.""** (Use black spray paint or watercolors to simulate smoke damage. DO NOT set fire to your unit. Rub with burnt charcoal from your BBQ for authentic smell. Press the test button on your room's smoke alarm when parents are present to really sell this one.)

3) **""The platter started spinning faster and faster, then flew off and hit me in the head (or wherever).""** (As a young person you're likely to have random injuries anyhow, so merely blame the Crosley for your latest boo-boo. If the platter detaches easily, dislodge it and place it elsewhere in your room. Squirt ketchup on the edge of the platter and allow to dry for damning evidence.)

4) **""I needed to use it for a science fair project to test parachute technology and it failed.""** (Tie a pillowcase with lengths of string to your Crosley and again, drop carefully out your window or off the roof.)

5) **""I donated it to a church/temple/other house of worship so the pastor/rabbi/holy man could play his old records of gospel songs/canting/spiritual uplift.""** (Be radiant with holiness while offering this boldfaced lie. Adhere to yours or your parents' actual religion, but make it a distant location so they don't ask pesky questions while going to worship.)

6) **""I took it sailing on a friend's boat but we hit the doldrums and had to toss all unnecessary cargo.""** (If they ask, tell them you were inspired by the Doors' Horse Latitudes.)

7) **""I tied it on the back of my bike and it fell off at such and such intersection, where it got smashed by a semi.""** (Act shaken and a little scared. No need to fake the accident, just ride around the block. Your beloved will be so glad you survived they won't think twice.) 

8) **""It was making weird devil sounds and I didn't want it in the house.""** (Make it clear that the sounds were happening while NOT playing a record, especially if you're into Ozzy or black metal.)

9) **""I sold it to help such and such poor friend pay the rent.""** (Or afford surgery, etc. A tricky approach—""Let them pay for their own live-work loft/gallstone removal""—so use as a last resort.)

10) **""What Crosley?""** (Recommended only for the bold. Act like it never existed and you have no recollection of the thing. Make sure it, and any telltale packaging, are out of the house completely before trying this risky gambit.)",,False,self,t5_2qh7i,1345559375.0,,,True,t3_ykxcc,http://www.reddit.com/r/vinyl/comments/ykxcc/ten_ways_to_explain_to_your_parents_or/,

I have always listened to my music digitally or on CD/SACD. There was something about vinyl that particularly struck a chord with me. 

Put simply I love how inconvenient it is. When I listen to CDs or ripped music from iTunes I have the ability to change the song at any time I please. Being somewhat new to it, I have an incredibly difficult time properly skipping to a desired track on an LP. This has made me sit through the songs I don't really care for, but in turn gave me a better appreciation for them. 

I don't have a top-notch table or phono-stage so my critical listening is still done with CDs. But I really do enjoy what vinyl has presented to me. ",,False,self,t5_2qh7i,False,,,True,t3_10dl7b,http://www.reddit.com/r/vinyl/comments/10dl7b/i_finally_realized_what_i_like_most_about_vinyl/,
