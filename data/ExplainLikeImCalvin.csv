My apologies again for lack of time to get this done, but I actually have been given 5 credits of Reddit Gold by the admins to give out to the best of our subreddit, so I'm thinking let's simplify this whole thing and focus on what we do best - *awesome answers*. Our Best of ELIC will be the top 5 answers for the past year.

Post your nominations below. This will run for 1 day, then I'll start a new voting-style thread to vote - the top 5 highest-voted answers will get their posters Reddit Gold. What the heck - feel free to nominate yourself.

The poster of the overall top-voted answer will also be named the honorary World's Best Dad for the year, just because I thought of it for the other post and like it (no extra Reddit Gold).

Will add more rules as I make them up on the spot...

Good luck!

After much much deliberating and fighting and throwing poo, the monkeys have returned with their judgments, and surprise! - the exactly five people nominated between the two threads have won for the *top five* answers. It's like it was meant to be (or we're all just incredibly lazy and/or disinterested).

These are our winners of an entire month's supply of **Reddit Gold**:

* sealclubber for the history of [Bricks and Mortar](http://www.reddit.com/r/ExplainLikeImCalvin/comments/umlwz/why_are_there_holes_in_bricks/c4wpfxx)

* shankingviolet for how [Dubstep Came from Whalesong](http://www.reddit.com/r/ExplainLikeImCalvin/comments/ut9u0/elic_what_is_dubstep/c4ycw3m)

* pcc987 for the difference between [Hipsters and Hippopotami](http://www.reddit.com/r/ExplainLikeImCalvin/comments/uwman/elic_whats_a_hipster/c4z82ut)

* Bananafanafofaser for the [History of the Joy-stick](http://www.reddit.com/r/ExplainLikeImCalvin/comments/147qls/elic_why_do_nintendo_64_controllers_have_three/c7aq0g6)

And to wrap this up, based purely on the number of nomination votes the winner of World's Best Dad (of the Year) is:

**pcc987**

Congrats! But you don't get anything extra, and your poll numbers are already slipping...

I'll be sending out the gold momentarily.

Reddit usually has site-wide nominations and voting in several categories, but this year it's a bit different - each subreddit is listing and voting on its own categories. Which frankly is right up our alley, cause we don't do things normal here.

The best part is that we moderators are getting up to 5 credits of Reddit Gold to give out to the winners of the competition. Unfortunately that might require a short turnaround time on picking our winners, which I'm hoping to clarify soon. I'll update this post with the timeframes.

**Process**

So here's the process we'll be using - 

1. Post nominations as replies to the category comments I've posted below. Please provide links to sources or examples. Feel free to comment on the nominations. (Note: only posts created before this one will qualify for nominations.)
2. We'll take the top 5 highest-voted posts in each category and create separate posts for each category using a new contest-style post that Reddit has provided.
3. After a set period of time we'll post the winners and distribute the Reddit Gold.

**Categories**

Since we do things a bit different, we won't have the usual categories, so I'll also provide some explanations: 

* **Best Answer** - Pretty straight-forward, the best overall answer to one of Calvin's questions. This should be a truly insightful answer with absolutely no basis in science or reality in general.

* **World's Best Dad Award** - The user with the best overall answers and contributions to the subreddit.

* **Best Hole-Digging** - The best follow-up comment by a dad in response to a follow-up question to their original answer. These should be examples where a user takes their answer to the next level of awesomeness.

* **Worst Adherence to Fact** - The best case of a user posting a factual science-based response to a question, usually by not realizing what subreddit they're in. These are sometimes as amusing as the answers themselves.

And because the strongest point in this community is its creativity, I'd also like to open it up to suggestions for a final category. I'll post a submission comment for suggestions below. Once we tally the feedback we'll likely just pick one to use and run a separate nomination post for that special category.

Also feel free to post any comments below or message us with any other suggestions or feedback about this process.

Good luck!",,False,,t5_2sp85,False,,,True,t3_15ict1,http://www.reddit.com/r/ExplainLikeImCalvin/comments/15ict1/meta_best_of_elic_2012_announcement_and/,moderator
