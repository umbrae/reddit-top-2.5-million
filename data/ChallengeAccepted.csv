**Update 1**

Its been 24 hours since I posted this. I already started on some of the challenges. will post pictures tonight. I made a drawing for the Photo Collage Frame, and got me some wood. my mom had a stitching set lying around, so that's something too. I'm going to start Challenge #2 now.


**Update 2**

another day has passed, I finished challenge 2. I got lost and found some large looking lake I didn't even know was there haha, will post pictures later (don't mind the shit quality, taken with my phone)
I also started on challenge #4 it's going to be a 17th century clipper on a rough looking sea. I must say stichting is quite relaxing. challenge #1 is also going on good, I think I'll have the frame finished by tommorow or wednesday, but painting it will take a little while longer.


**Update 3** 
Progress is going slow, I'm at my moms's house, working on constructing stuff for my room. havn't really had the time for something else on my challenge list.


Thanks for all the suggestions guys, I regret nothing.

I've played the game a bajillion times (short order -- probably about 10, but that's still a lot), listened to the soundtrack hundreds of times (no hyperbole, that's just iTunes' listed number of plays), love the music to death.  Some of the tracks I already know (kinda cheating, then, I guess), even played them at a friends' wedding.  

So the gameplan is to stop screwin' around, playing lots and lots of other things, and focus on this singular project.  The plan is, 40 days from now, I will have it all down, memorized, and up on Youtube.  Maybe in lengthy videos without cuts, no book in front of me, displaying that hey, I can still do this whole ""piano"" thing.

(If you wanna see some really, really badly recorded videos, look up my username on Youtube.  I'm better now, I promise.  Although the cameras ain't exactly staggeringly better...but hey, whatever, I guess.  Focus!)

Anywho, here are the songs that I have thus far.  (**Current count:  45/64 Songs.**  I'm two-thirds of the way there...)

Edit:

Wheeeeeelp, I didn't get it done in 40 days.  I did roughly 1/3 of the songs from the game, but considering I only had my iPhone 4 (which I - sadly - used for all of the recordings (save Track 11, ""Secret of the Forest"")) for half of the time...I'd say getting 21 songs done in 20 days ain't bad.  Still not the kind of pace I would have wanted to accomplish the project in 40 days, but I'm not daunted by the overall program.  I *will* finish this.  You *will* see me play the entire blasted soundtrack.  And hopefully, assuming I can get a better camera to work with (and use the sound set-up I already have but couldn't sync up with the cameras I own)...when I'm done, I'll celebrate the projects' completion by live-streaming my playing the entire soundtrack in one go.  2.5 hours.  No skin off of my nose, I've been known to sit and play video game medleys for 4+ hours at a time; limiting myself to a singular game wouldn't be that hard.

So that's the plan.  Sorry I didn't get it done in the time limit, but it WILL get done.  Count on it.  Following that, I have bigger, better, bolder plans to put into motion.  *::cackles maniacally::*",,False,,t5_2s9nq,1375650548.0,,,True,t3_1cd2cg,http://www.reddit.com/r/ChallengeAccepted/comments/1cd2cg/i_have_taken_it_upon_myself_to_learn_all_the/,

In my case, I plan to accomplish this- rather daunting- task in the 26 days between this post and my eighteenth Birthday.
I tried this once before– over the summer– with much greater success than I thought would be possible. Unfortunately, the growing piles of schoolwork threw me off. But I know I can do it.

Here's what presumably makes my quest a little more unique: I'll be basing my goals on two key ideals– ""classy"" and ""Hufflepuff.""
The ""classy"" I think should be fairly self-explanatory, so I won't expound upon it in here. As for the Hufflepuff, I've looked all over for role models that could successfully inspire me. Couldn't find any person or doctrine that seemed to click for me. Over the summer, when Pottermore came out (yes, go ahead, laugh) I did a complete reread of the Harry Potter books and turned back to the house that I had always identified with, Hufflepuff. The qualities ascribed to it (""Just and Loyal,"" ""True and Unafraid of Toil"") fit in line perfectly with my goals.

So here I go, starting today on my road to becoming the perfect classy Hufflepuff.

In these 26 days, I intend to:
• Get back into the shape I was a month ago where I could run the six flights of stairs and cross-campus to get between two classes without getting out of breath.

• Get up every (week)day at or before 6:00

• Have all work done by evening Friday

• Set aside at least 45 minutes a day to read (keeping track through goodreads).

• Practice cello for at least an hour each day.

• Style myself up a little more daringly with the help of /r/lesbianfashionadvice

• Make my lunch bento more interesting

• Have all college applications done

• Shower **every day**. No exceptions.

• Be more outgoing. Don't leave every social engagement thinking, ""Oh god, what have I *said*?""

• Keep track of all tasks better. Remember to write them down.

• Do daily 750 words.

• Manage my ADHD better.


Particularly given this last item, I'm sure I've forgotten something, but that's a pretty good listing of the basics.

Basically I'm graduating in 6 months time and, assuming nobody offers me a job, I'm going to take a 'gap year' and fill it with things I can be proud of.

Low cost but adventurous, possibly physically demanding and exhibiting independence.
Currently, other ideas include:

* 3 Peaks Challenge (http://www.thethreepeakschallenge.co.uk/)

* Canoeing the length of a river through Scotland unassisted (I know nothing of canoeing - any recommendations for river systems or routes would be great!)

* Walk the width of Britain ( approx 190 miles, St Bees to Robin Hoods Bay)

Are you up to it?,18,4,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/ChallengeAccepted/comments/12omdg/21_female_bored_with_life_i_want_you_to_play/,"I'm terribly bored with my life. I'm a bit lonely. I came up with this game, Truth or Dare at life where we challenge each other to take risks with our lives and tell each other truth about ourselves. It could be like, ""ask your girl/guy who you have liked for years out"" or ""ask someone at Chapters out"" if there's no romantic interest in your life. Challenge each other to try something new like a new healthy recipe for dinner, for example. And tell each other truth about ourselves that we haven't told anyone else.
I want challenges to be more about productivity, love life, self-improvement or something like that. Realistic goals. I don't really want to do nonsense stuff that would waste time and money. As for truth, we can share stuff with each other and learn more about ourselves and each other. We can play this game together.

**Game Rules:** 
To make the game clear, in your original post, you write a small description about yourself so we have a good idea what challenges we can offer for you to help you reach your goals. You should write down if you are open to the truth questions since it's just optional. Be sure to have a throwaway account if you are worried about your privacy just in case. People reply to your original post with both truth questions and challenges. In your original post, you write down answers to truth questions. You also write down your challenges and when you are going to accomplish them. 

If you have suggestions to make the game better, please let me know.  I am glad that some of you like the idea. :)

**If you don't want to play, you can give me challenges instead.** 

**A bit of information about myself:** I'm an aspiring Concept Artist who is taking Concept Art program at college this winter and have no love life to speak of. I am staying at home bored out of my mind. I'm out of shape. I have only two friends that I still talk to from time to time since high school. See, boring life lol.

I'm serious enough about this goal that I'm doing it on my regular account. Be warned though…this is a long one. Bear with me.

Me- 20/M

I have a problem: I am hopelessly dependent on the approval of women. I'm always, always searching for a relationship when I'm single. I'm sure I reek of desperation. It's like my sole goal in life at times is to be able to have my Facebook profile say ""In a Relationship with X."" Sometimes I feel like I'm living some kind of worthless half-life until I find ""the one,"" or find a manic pixie dream girl (look it up if you don't know the concept) to 'liberate' me from this 'shitty' life I live. This is a mode of thought I've found myself in since about 2005…so this is a pretty deepest problem.

This mode of thought has a stranglehold on self esteem and feelings. I'll feel depressed when I see happy couples together at my college. When I meet a nice girl who seems interested in me, I'll rush headlong into either asking her out or acting like a couple (I've driven several women away this way). If I develop a crush on a girl, I'll begin feeling extremely jealous of her and other people (specifically men, of course) even if we're not dating or anything close to it.  If a girl rejects me, it will destroy my self esteem for a short time.

Then there's all of the wasted time, effort, and brain power. I'm prone to overthinking things in the first place. My mind will be plagued about thoughts of needing a girlfriend, or trying to impress a certain woman all day. It's so stressful. Then comes the pickup artist material. I was naturally drawn to this because it promised to help me do better with women, but it makes me overthink interactions with women *even more.* Not to mention I've started acting differently than I normally do around women because of tips the material may give, so women are getting to know someone who isn't really me. I have nothing against the PUA community though- there's a lot of great stuff on not just improving relations with women, but social skills and life improvement in general. I've just had problems interpreting it wrongly and using the wrong techniques on wrong situations.

Possibly the worst thing is that it's twisted my perception of women. I'm so hellbent on getting a relationship that I constantly misinterpret a girl's actions. I oversimplify things- I've come to viewing them as either bitches, flakes, taken, or the small dateable margin. That's a gross, gross generalization. I seem to have forgotten that women are, you know, flawed, imperfect people who have their own wants, needs, feelings, problems, struggles, etc. Women deal with problems most guys never understand (or never try to understand).

**But no more.**

In the past I've tried to bury myself in other things, but this old problem inevitably comes back up again. This time I've decided to take a proactive approach. I'm going to not only improve my life, but dissect these thoughts and misconceptions. I've ironed out several areas to focus on:

**1- Remove Temptation to Overthink**
The first thing I did was unsubscribe from r/seduction and r/dating_advice. These are both extremely helpful subreddits for those who use them right, but in my current frame of mind, it's best for me to stay away from them. Reading some PUA material or dating advice posts may give me temporary confidence boosts, but usually leads to stress or disappointment when it doesn't work out the way I planned. I may very well return to the PUA community in the future, but for now, it's best to stay away. Besides, GetMotivated and Fitness give me so much better self improvement material!

**2- Productivity!**
I've lost too much time and brain power to this search for women's approval in the past. All of that lost productivity, but it can be turned around. Focusing on productive things not only will keep my mind off of those nasty thoughts, but at the same time lead to productive, self esteem building achievements. I've even ironed out a list of things I can do just to remind myself there *are* things I can focus on instead.

* Learn Maya
* Learn to play notes on guitar (mostly just know chords)
* Develop (and write) the screenplay I've been tinkering with
* Read the works of Edgar Allan Poe (I share a birthday with the man and love the stuff I've read so far)
* Pitch my graphic novel project to more companies (I spent most of the summer developing the pitch, but the hustle of my junior year stalled out my efforts)
* Finish watching Soul Eater (I started this anime around the beginning of the semester, but I've only gotten 30 eps in)
* Finish Shin Megami Tensei: Strange Journey (stuck on the final boss since summer before I lost interest- but Mem Aleph's days are numbered)
* Fill out more job applications
* Develop a more cohesive diet (I want to cut fat but still build muscle. I need to diet accordingly)
…and so on.

**3- Focus on Understanding Women**
All people are complex individuals. Everyone has their own feelings, and those feelings cause them to react to situations in their own unique ways. In the past I've failed to consider this with women. I take a friend zoning as a horrible insult…instead of considering that a woman just doesn't have those feelings for me. A poster in seddit told me to try this: getting to know and understanding a female friend, not trying to date or screw her. This is a great idea because A) It will make me more empathetic towards women, and less likely to be bitter over their actions, and B) Actually make some female *friends*. Not every interaction with a woman *has* to be romantic or sexual. And we can all use more friends, right?

**4- Positivity!**
Self explanatory, right? Some times I get so caught up in worrying that a certain girl doesn't like me…that I forget I'm surrounded by friends and family that all are great sources of affection. Even more important is that I have a source of positivity right here- me. I'm going to praise myself more. Give myself credit for my achievements. Cut myself slack when I mess up. 'Cause you know what? I'm awesome, and so are you!

**5- Stop. Fapping.**
One of the goals had to be inappropriate for dinner conversation, right? And I should clarify- it isn't just fapping, it's a porn addiction too. Let's just say my frustrations with women have influenced my tastes in porn, and leave it at that. I stopped by r/StopFap today, and read about some of the affects of porn addiction- decreased drive for social interaction, decreased libido, etc. Plus, it would just make me feel terrible at times. I've read many stories about guys who broke their porn/fap addictions and experienced less social anxiety and more confidence- even if they weren't getting laid all the time. So I've started the process, just deleted my porn stash on my comp. Not just put in the Trash, though. Emptied too. No need to go any deeper into this subject, though.

Those 5 areas sound like great places to start. I'm not trying, I'm doing. I'm kicking out this little troll that's been in the back of my head for 6 goddamn years. I'm taking my life back. If these actions lead to me getting laid more or getting into a great relationship- great! But if they don't, then it doesn't matter- *because freeing myself is the best possible result anyways.*

TL;DR: Completely dependent on women for validation in my life- changing that.

Can't believe I made it. Now I'll admit I missed a few days, but I did catch up eventually. It was fun. Now, onwards to GREATER things!**

A few weeks ago, I came across a post about a drawing challenege. In which you draw one item from the list every day, for 30 days. So I’ve decided to join. I started March 2nd and will be ending March 31st. I’ve included an imgur link to my album which I will update every day for the remainder of the challenge.

I am by no means good at drawing. I’ve never taken an art class and I had stopped drawing all together for a number of years. It’s not until recently that I’ve decided I’d like to get better and practice drawing more. I thought this would be a good way to get myself back into the habit of drawing regularly.

My post is mainly to show that I am keeping my word and I am drawing each day. In the hopes of motivating others to do the same with whatever goals or challeneges they have in mind for themselves. So if you’d like to join the challenge please feel free to do so. Whether it’s drawing or exercising or eating healthy for 30 days. Also, go ahead and make a post and I’ll go check it out; maybe this way we can keep each other focused and motivated.

Also, keep this in mind. If you’re going to make your own list of 30 challenges, try to make them actually challenging. Don’t make them too easy or just simply choose that which you are already good at. Try to step outside your comfort zone and do something you normally wouldn’t do.

Note: I’ve only just submitted this post now, because I couldn’t get my scanner to work. I had to install a new scanner. And I’ve also been busy with other things. Also, I’d like to note thet on Day 5 (yesterday) I completely forgot to do my drawing.

You're invited, but the rules are as follows:
- no pessimism or ""healthy skepticism"" is allowed
- upon accepting this challenge you are confirming that you believe it is possible
- we shall form a mastermind group and check in with each other regularly to see how progress is going
- we'll celebrate heartily once we've achieved!

Furthermore:
- the logical question to ask is ""how?"" how will we go about making this ten grand? It's certainly up to you: you can earn money however it suits you.
- However at the same time, if you're unsure about the how: the how often will make itself clear if we pay enough attention and good vibes toward having the money.
- Deliberate attention and strong good feelings are all that are required to bring all good things into our lives
- The most important aspect will be focusing on the ten grand regularly, learning to believe that it will come, and then to expect it
- This is sort of an act of faith (although the word can be sometimes annoying to hear)... but faith will be the lubricant that will make this happen.
- Stranger things have happened to people than suddenly earning $10,000
- And it's also not a lot of money in the grand scheme of things. To the universe, it's just as easy to earn a dollar as it is to earn ten thousand dollars

And there we are! Comment here or send me a note if you're interested and we'll form our group! It'll be great and we'll probably become besties too.
