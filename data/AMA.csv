I am Gov. Gary Johnnson, Honorary Chairman of the Our America Initiative, and the two-term Governor of New Mexico from 1994 - 2003.
Here is proof that this is me: https://twitter.com/GovGaryJohnson/status/301464312063614976

I've been referred to as the 'most fiscally conservative Governor' in the country, and vetoed so many bills during my tenure that I earned the nickname ""Governor Veto."" I bring a distinctly business-like mentality to governing, and believe that decisions should be made based on cost-benefit analysis rather than strict ideology. Like many Americans, I am fiscally conservative and socially tolerant.
I'm also an avid skier, adventurer, and bicyclist. I have currently reached the highest peak on five of the seven continents, including Mt. Everest and, most recently, Aconcagua in South America.

OK, so... the title up there is copied from a post someone else made.  ...then someone bugged my little sister into bugging me to do this.  :-P
So, a short intro.  I grew up in the burbs of Ontario.  I thought it was boring.  I'd sit in school dreaming about jumping out the window and running until I couldn't anymore, and see where i ended up.
Boredom and frustruation got to the point where I decided I'd rather die than live the way most people around me did.
So... I started living as if I was playing a video game.  Like... in a video game, you'd never choose the boring path.  Why would you in life?
There have been a lot of difficulties.  Moslty cultural resistance to being independant, but its all worth it.
Now I spend most of my time working on projects that I think the world needs.  ...hoping to show a different way of life that others might be inspired by, and join in on.
I don't make a lot of money, or spend a lot.  I make a bit here and there doing odd jobs, and my website accepts donations to help with projects which has helped a lot.  I send people t-shirts... and sometimes other requested things for their donations.  I really have to thank everyone who donates anything.  I wouldn't be almost finished a giant robot without it!  :-)  There's lots of info on my website...
Jamius.com
...and i just started the ""adventure builders club"".  Its to help people (including me) focus on being a positive influence on the world.  :-)  I was uploading the video to youtube when I noticed something like 500 new subscribers.  ...and someone pointed out the reason... the reddit post, etc.  
So, blah blah blah...
I'll shut up now, and hopefully i can figure out how to get back here to answer questions.  (I haven't used this site before.  Don't worry, though.  I'll figure it out.)

As I was reaching over to pick up the remote I heard a loud crackle and felt a sharp pain in my lower back -- he had jabbed a Taser into my spine. A few minutes later I was laying on my kitchen floor barely clinging to life. It was the most harrowing day of my life but today I wear my scars with pride -- ask me anything.

Sequence of events:
1. Guy asks me if he can give a package to my sister. I oblige and make casual conversation with him, he lets himself into the house.
2. As I turn to pick up the TV remote, he hits me in the lower back with a Taser.
3. I turn to fight him off, bringing him to the ground at the base of my staircase leading upstairs. 
4. I put him into a choke hold and begin punching + slamming him over the head with a brass lamp. Thinking I had inflicted enough damage to knock him out, I let go and sprint to the kitchen to call the cops. 
5. I pick up the phone but realize he's right behind me. I throw the phone at his face and it shatters.
6. I run to my knife drawer and pull whatever I can from it. He pulls a knife from his pocket. 
7. This is where it gets a bit hazy, this may have lasted about thirty seconds, but it felt quicker. He hit me with a steak knife in the chest, shoulder, and my right leg at some point but I can't actually remember when. 
8. We fell to the ground at the base of the oven/stovetop with him on top of me. He begins sawing at the back of my neck and nearly cuts through my artery before stopping and telling me that this ""was not meant for me"".
9. I plead with him to leave the house, he exits through my front door. 
10. I lock myself in a small office and sit down. Time seems to stop as the adrenaline burns off. I look down and notice blood flowing from my chest. 
11. I try to stop the bleeding myself and place my hand over my right shoulder. The moment I pull it off, blood fires from the wound on my shoulder and I realize I'm in bad shape. I call 9-11.
12. The first cop arrives, gun drawn. He searches the house, but the guy is gone. 
13. EMS arrives, lays me on the kitchen floor and begins applying gauze and pressure to my wounds. 
14. They get me in an ambulance and close off the GSP to get me to the Jersey Shore Medical Center.
15. I'm brought into trauma center and the doctors go to work.

Lets try this again! (They deleted my damned post and made me post it elsewhere)

I'm addicted to heroin. I shoot up at least a half gram of Black Tar at a time. I have seen my boyfriend overdose and nearly die. I am covered in track marks from shooting up. I have used extremely dull and dirty needles. I have shared needles. Both my boyfriend and I have had cotton fever several times. My boyfriend and I sold heroin for months to support our habit. We have gotten pulled over with 5 grams on us. I had to put it where the sun doesn't shine. He got arrested that night and ended up getting a DUI for heroin. We only pay 50 dollars a gram, but that adds up when you're going through 2 to 3 1/2 grams a day.

I was anorexic and bulimic for several months. I took meth every day to manage my appetite and speed up my weight loss.

That resulted in a suicide attempt. I took over 400 aspirin and never had my stomach pumped because I got to the hospital 15 hours after I took them. I was deaf for 3 days, my kidneys stopped working and they gave me dialysis, and I sat in excruciating pain for days wondering whether or not I was going to die.
I have been in a Behavioral Watch Facility.

My childhood often consisted of me being in shady situations. My whole family is addicted to something. I have been molested several times from when I was an infant to when I was 16. My mother watched her boyfriend molest me several times when I was about 5 years old. One incident resulted in a pregnancy. I carried and gave birth to that child. My father molested me when I was 12.

I have dealt with endless amounts of verbal and physical abuse from family and boyfriends. I was beat up when I was 8 months pregnant and put into premature labor. (They stopped it and I had her the day after my due date.)

My parents gave me opiate pain killers and alcohol when I was an infant to put me to sleep. I have been to the hospital 100s of times.

I gave birth to a child that was conceived by rape and put her up for adoption. I had to hand my child away because I realized I couldn't provide her with the best life she could have, no matter how much I wanted to.
Until I started 10th grade, I had never lived in the same house or gone to the same school for longer than 5 months. I have lived with each of my family members, in foster homes, shelters, and group homes. I was anally raped when I was in the shelter. The woman in charge of watching the house fell asleep. About 20 people saw me with no pants or underwear, covered in blood, and in hysterics that night.

That induced the nightmares. Every time I would fall asleep after that, I would relive all of the fucked up things I have experienced one by one. People would wake me up because I was moving around and freaking out in my sleep. I would wake up screaming and crying, unable to catch my breath. This lead to 2 weeks of insomnia. I took meth to stay awake. I fell into mental psychosis. Eventually, I forced myself to face my biggest fear: sleep. I took three extremely strong sleeping pills. (Normally one would be more than enough to knock me out.) I slept for 48 hours without waking up once.

I have several dark sexual fetishes. (Femdom/BDSM/etc.)

I ran away from the time I was 16 until I turned 18. I was listed as an endangered runaway by the National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children.

I wrote this AMA to answer the questions about rape, addiction, suicide, and all the other taboos of American society that people are afraid to ask. Don't be afraid to offend me. I have coped with my life. Please ask everything you want to know, no matter how detailed or personal it is. I will provide any proof that I can.

My mother found blood in my diaper when I was 9 months old.

After asking doctors about it, they repeatedly told her it was blood from my stool(poo-poo), and that there was nothing to worry about.

A month later after being colic for a month with non stop crying and bloody diapers, my mom switched doctors and my new paediatrician diagnosed me with Precocious Puberty.

This is because I was born with a benign(non life threatening) tumour in my brain on my pituitary gland, which causes hormones to be released early, making me hit puberty as an infant.

The reason I was crying was because I was undergoing period cramps(the lining of my uterus was shedding).

My body was developed so I had pubic hair and breasts, even slightly as an infant.

I was given hormone treatment up until I was 9 years old because it stopped working.

I was constantly bullied when I was in elementary school for wearing a bra. Boys snapped my straps and constantly told me I didn't need to wear one.

When I entered middle school I went through puberty practically for a second time and when I did, it hit me hard all at once. Acne, breast size fluctuation, and my period. (I went through bras fluctuating from a C cup at 8 ,to a D cup at 10, to a AA cup at 15, to a B cup at 16, then back to a C at 17-18)

For about 5-6 years (around my sophomore year in highschool) My period was really irregular. I had my period 3 to 4 times a year, and when I did, it lasted for up to a month. When I did have my period, it was super heavy and the pain was extremely excruciating.

No menstral medication i took ever helped, nor did any home remedies(heat pads/oils). I couldn't purchase pads or normal sized tampons because my flow was so heavy. Initially, when someone saw in my bag that I had super tampons, I would get slagged even more. At this point I was extremely depressed.

In high school, I had been slagged for my hight(4'11"") every single day as long as I was around someone(school mates, school faculty and staff, relatives, ""friends"", and even people who I haven't even met or I was just introduced to).

Nothing makes me feel worse than being made fun of for m height, because there is absolutely nothing I can do about it.
I decided to go into therapy for how I was feeling. Therapy, unfortunately, did not help me.

Today I still have an irregular period now and again, I still get a ton of shit for being short, and I still suffer from depression.

TL;DR I have a tumour on my brain that made me go through puberty as an infant, received hormone treatment, stopped growing at 4'11"", was bullied and tormented, had the worst period experience, and have been suffering from depression because of it all.

Edit: I would like to thank everyone for all of the support and confidence boosts. I ended up falling asleep and waking up to this has just been so heartwarming and a beautiful experience.

I have a disconnection with my inner self and often have a difficult time forming strong opinions about things, making decisions that affect me personally, etc. It is almost impossible for me to form a mental picture of what I look like, though I can remember what I look like by thinking of specific photographs that have been taken of me, etc. I actually keep a photo of myself on my desk that I look at at least once every 10 minutes, as sort of a ""self anchor"".

(x-post /r/relationship_tips)",356,125,60,http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/15s9zl/im_a_33_year_old_male_who_at_18_knocked_up_his/,"As the title states, I'm now 33 and my wife is 31. While having beaten incredible odds, we've done our fair share of fucking up. This will be mostly about myself, but having been with my wife for over 16 years now, my marriage and my family and my wife take up a significant portion of that story. So here goes.

I was born in San Diego, California, and even as a small child I knew I was lucky to be growing up in paradise. I visited my grandparents in Phoenix one summer and asked why people didn't go to the beach since it was so hot all the time. I felt sympathy when I was told there was no ocean there. I loved San Diego. This is important. 

I had a pretty normal elementary school situation, wasn't popular, wasn't not popular, I was smart, things went well but not exceptional. I did however make the notable decision at the age of 12 to skip going to my local junior high and instead get on a bus at 6:30am to get sent off across town to a much better school in a terrible neighborhood with a computers program. This is also important.

At any rate, when I was 15, during the summer between 9th and 10th grade, I was informed that my family and I would be moving to Denver not long after the upcoming Christmas. This was not news that I welcomed. I'd had a few girlfriends by this point (five during my freshman year alone, so I had a pretty active social life), and was enjoying playing in my awful garage band. Because I was young and 6 months was a long time, I generally just played this up to my advantage to get free stuff from my male friends and attention from my female friends.

That is, until the week after Thanksgiving in 1994, when my parents flew to Denver to look for a house, and I stayed over with a friend and rode the bus with him to school (I'd chosen to attend far-away high school as well). 

Then my life changed forever, and I promise it's not in the way you think.

My friend introduced me to a girl that week who would eventually impact my life in some big ways. I won't give a ton of story for this part though because it's not super relevant except:

* We started dating with exactly 30 days to go before I moved away, which at 15 and at the height of one's pretention, seems very cinematic and tragic and lends the whole thing a very fated/Romeo and Juliet kind of thing, which wasn't the kind of emotional shit I really needed to handle at that moment in time.
* She was my first semi-sexual partner (I've never known how to classify this, she gave me oral and I fingered her but that was the extent of it. Not sure if that means I was a virgin after that or not.)
* She broke up with me the day after Valentines Day after I'd moved because she'd already kissed some other boy. We'd of course written awful poetry to each other, spoken about marriage, decided we were soul mates, had plans for children, what our jobs would be, where we'd live, etc. by this point and that's how our relationship ended, that time.
* We remained in this unhealthy non-friends, non-enemies, non-dating but on and off nonsense as periodically more than friends for a couple years, even while we both were relatively involved with other people. Unsurprisingly at this point, this is also important.

My move to Colorado was tough but ultimately I found many new friends (even if we were the weirdos who looked like Robert Smith and Morrissey), a new band, a new core group of people I still talk with to this day, and many girls, including the amazing one who'd become my wife. She was a friend of the girl I was dating at the time. She said something to someone about my girlfriend having a ""vaginal wrench"" on me, and that she'd vowed to have me by the end of the year. She had me within two weeks.

You see, since I was very little, girls were an obsession for me. I never had that ""girls are gross"" stage, I pretty much always wanted to be around them and as I got older I pretty much always wanted to be inside them. And the two I slept with by the time I was 17 obliged frequently and sometimes acrobatically. I often wish for my own 18-year old virility back, but I digress. Let it be made clear here that the two girls I'd slept with (as in PIV sexytimes) includes the girl who'd become my wife. While the girl she'd ""stolen"" me from and I fought constantly and had real issues with jealousy and clinginess (mostly on my part), I found that this new girl (call her K) and I didn't fight at all. We just didn't, and really still don't. We'd discuss any issues that came up an talk them through. Everything was great, we got along really, really well. Too well, in fact. Her mom had a hard time dealing with her divorce and was essentially a unipolar depressed person who did nothing but work at her job and watch TV. She wasn't the most attentive woman around, which was gold for a 17-year old boy and his hot 16-year old girlfriend who wants nothing more than to fuck him. She had to convince me it was time to have sex, I was very cautious and didn't want to jump into things, but of course we did.

And being moronic teenagers who believe they are invincible, of course we got her pregnant.

Finding out about this was no picnic, as you can imagine. We were trying to find a place to eat, it was our 1 year anniversary which also tends to fall on homecoming (long story) and at dinner, she kept running to the bathroom to throw up, which has been turned out to be a clear sign that my wife is pregnant ever since.

I'd started art school by this point, but after much discussion and crying and explaining to our parents, we decided to have the baby. I went to school and worked a combined 15 hours a day some days, she worked at Target, and we lived together at her mothers house for about a year and a half. 

I eventually got a good job in my field that paid me a salary, we moved out into our own apartment, and we got married about 18 months after our son was born. We waited to get married, which I think was a really smart decision, because we didn't want to rush into a marriage and eventually feel obligated to each other in more ways than our son if a relationship between us didn't work out. It was a good move, I think, even if it did confuse my son when he was old enough to do the math between our number of years married and his age. (""Wait, but I'm 13. That means you've been married 13 years, right?"" ""Uh, no."")

We had a young and growing family, we had ups and downs financially, I lost jobs and insurance, the economy tanked, I supported us on freelance and unemployment. While I worked for one particular shitty company, we had our second child when our oldest was three despite the fact that my employer never paid my insurance premiums, unbeknownst to us, and so our baby's delivery and my wife's pre-natal care were not covered. This led to terrible debt issues, which led to us paying rent late regularly. We needed co-signers for car loans, we had our phones shut off routinely, and through it all, we loved each other, supported each other and in general made a happy life out of a hard one by loving each other and our children. When our son was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes at age 5, incurring a life-altering set of instructions for how to care for him to keep him alive, we didn't have health insurance for his hospitalization and incurred a $38,000 hospital bill, and despite it all, we rolled with those punches, too.

Having received her GED, my wife attended nursing aid school and went to work overnight at a hospital. Let me preface that I'm not blaming her being gone at night for what I'm going to tell you about what I did next,. but it explains how I had the time and what kind of environment I was in. 

You see, about when she went to work at the hospital, our marriage had devolved a bit, as the above paragraph might lead you to expect:

* Since we had been together since we were essentially children and hadn't had much time to mature independently, we were emotionally enmeshed and incredibly co-dependent, as a therapist would later point out.
* We just always had to deal with lots of money problems, which only got worse and worse and worse when my son went to the hospital.
* We developed trust issues, I was snooping through her email and she mine, and at this time I became inappropriately close friends with an ex girlfriend. The one from before, from California. The one I'd had unhealthy and bone-headed obsessions with for years and years. That one.
* We had two children under 5 who were incredibly spirited did not particularly get along
* We dealt with sleep deprivation, mood swings, depression, anxiety, passive aggressiveness, codependency.
* On top of all of this, we spent 5 nights a week apart. We still had sex quite frequently, but our intimacy was threadbare.

Pretty clearly here, I did some dumb shit. Like, really dumb shit. Shit that I would not be able to take if I had to live though it again. 

Shit that in a fucked up way saved my marriage.

See, I entered into an emotional affair with (surprise!) the previously mentioned ex girlfriend, the one from before my big move. The one I never got out of my life despite my friends hating her, despite my wife insisting this woman still had a thing for me, the woman I'd been convinced at one point I was going to marry had I not ""been trapped by my wife and kids into this life"". 

This woman was getting married soon, and had her doubts about that. We discussed our relationships in intimate detail which led to the inevitable ""we could treat each other so much better than our spouses are"". We didn't care what our spouses would have thought about it, we were only in it for ourselves and had tons of ways to justify what we were doing. We started sending insane amounts of text messages, we employed secret email accounts, all-day IMing while we were at work, all- night phone calls while my wife was at work... It was bad. 

The only way I can describe living with myself while behaving this way is: compartmentalization. I could alternatively turn on and off the self devoted to my wife and family and the self devoted to my affair. I could post all day about this and I bet it's where most of my questions come from. Some points from above that played into this behavior besides a complete lack of love for myself, respect for my wife, and mental clarity:

* I had a soft-spot in my heart for my hometown San Diego (still do) and she was a connection back to a time I saw as before my life fell apart. Before I'd been moved against my will, before I knocked someone up, before I would have needed to scrape snow off my car in the morning.
* The affair took place exactly 10 years after our initial whirlwind Christmastime fling in high school and somehow that made it seem just as poetic or justified or meant to be or something equally self-serving and disgusting. It was easy to slip back into that ill-fated, star-cross'd lovers mindset and step outside of everyday life.
* I had spent a lot of time missing that 16-year old I fell in love with and got pregnant while simultaneously resenting the 23-year old stressed out wife and mother she'd become. At my hands, admittedly, but that wasn't important to me at the time. I told you it was fucked up.
* I was not capable of communicating my needs to my wife because I didn't feel she was capable of hearing them, so I told my ex instead and she told me about her unmet needs and we decided to be each other's ""fun"" secret. When some issue got heated between us (she wanted to get presents for my kids, and I wouldn't let her, for instance), we'd cool it off by reminding ourselves that we were the ""fun ones"".

The sequence of events for Christmas 2004 was:

* Early Christmas morning - my wife leaves town to visit her sister on a pre-planned trip
* Christmas evening - I take my kids to Denny's for dinner and get incredibly depressed and thoughtful about  what I was about to do, and what would happen to my life because of it.
* Day after Christmas - I take my kids to my parents' house and drive directly to the airport, where I pick up the woman I had up until this point been having an emotional affair with.
* The next 24 hours - proceed to take this emotional affair into the physical realm.
* Evening of December 27 - send my mistress home
* New Year's Eve - pick up my wife from her trip

What you need to understand is: my wife is truly amazing. It's at this point in the story, where I really truly realized just how amazing. When she found out that the Christmas trip I'd sent her on to see her sister included my ex-girlfriend coming to town and spending 24 hours with me at a hotel downtown, she didn't throw me out. She was beyond angry, to be sure, but she didn't throw me out. She said she wasn't done with me yet. She came close to being done with me many, many times, but she never did. This can be attributed to about 12 million things, but mostly:

* Seriously, we really do love each other
* Lots of therapy
* Lots of therapy
* Appropriately-medicated mental health
* I worked my ass off to prove to her just how re-devoted I was to us. I wasn't great at first but I got the hang of it.

We worked on ourselves a lot over the next few years, and separated once for a total of 24 hours. She demanded I quit smoking to prove I had future plans with her and my children, and I did. Her mother moved in and helped manage the household while our marriage swept back and forth between stability and chaos. We cried a lot, we yelled a lot, we fucked a lot (we've always done that though). Once when things were back on a good track, I mentioned once how much I regretted doing what I'd done, and my wife said ""I don't, if you hadn't had an affair, we wouldn't have been forced to look at ourselves and fix things. Your affair saved our marriage."" And while I agree, I certainly can't say it's the best way to go about things.

And here we are. Our son is 14 and in high school himself. Our daughter is 11 and in middle school. We have a 4-year old who is incredible. My mother in law has moved out, I am finally at the very top of my career and field (remember that whole computer school thing?), my wife is a full-fledged nurse, one of the best at her work. She still works five nights a week but that isn't a problem in the slightest because of how we treat each other the rest of the time. We make well into the 6 figures and can provide things for our children and ourselves we never even dreamed of. I've been to New Zealand, New York, Iceland, Hungary, Ireland, Amsterdam and more for work and travel has always been something I love and without my wife's support and love I wouldn't have been able to accomplish half of what I have. I had to realize it's because of them that my life is great, not in spite of them. I'm not perfect but I'm working on being the best dad I can be and the best husband I can be and things are working out pretty well. To anyone who sees a bit of themselves in the chaos above, I'm proof that things can work out, even when you fuck up.

Anyway, there it is in abridged form, the full thing takes much longer to tell.

Original post:  I'm a biologist with the New England Aquarium (Boston, Mass). Every fall we get a lot of stranded sea turtles that wash up on Cape Cod in a hypothermic state called ""cold-stunning"", and we take them in and heal them up and then release them. But this last fall we had a huge number of turtles strand - broke our all-time record - 242 sea turtles stranded! Most of them are young Kemp's ridleys, which are critically endangered - it is the most endangered sea turtle in the world). And also we got some elegant little greens and dozens of hulking big loggerheads (both those species are also endangered). We had to ship turtles out to every other institution that could take any. Most of them are healed up now and ready to release back to sea, but sea temperatures are only warm enough for them right now in Florida. So we're driving them to Florida. Picking up turtles on route from 6 other institutions in Maine, Mass, Connecticut, Maryland, Virginia and South Carolina. By the time we reach Florida it'll be Sunday and we'll have 50 sea turtles to release. We will release them all Sun mid-morning on the beach.

3pm update: (EST) We have 41 sea turtles now in 3 rented Chevy Suburbans, each with 3 people and 13-14 turtles, plus a 4th truck carrying a camera crew from Florida. We just picked up 4 loggerheads in Connecticut. JUST BARELY got the last loggerhead to fit in. Next stop is the National Aquarium in Baltimore at about 7pm, where we will acquire another truck and more people and more turtles. Assuming we get out of the traffic jam on I-95 that we are all stuck in....we're going at like 2mph right now. We're getting close to NYC.

My truck has 10 Kemp's in it right now, in little gray crates, and also 2 big loggerheads in dog kennels, one of which is making a lot of racket. We'll be driving all night. Please help keep us awake with lots of questions! (Or tell us some funny jokes!)  If there is interest I will post pix tomorrow of the turtles being released on the beach.

more info about the ""sea turtle trek"" [here](http://rescue.neaq.org/2013/04/get-ready-for-sea-turtle-trek.html)

One if our trucks is being tracked [here](http://rescue.neaq.org/2013/04/follow-seaturtletrek.html) - that's not my truck, it's the lead truck.

I think we're also on twitter ( #seaturtletrek) and on Facebook (""New England Aquarium"").

Not sure what to do for proof but here is a pic I snapped this morning of [2 Kemp's ridley sea turtles sleeping with their heads hidden](http://imgur.com/b71Sw0d) (they do that a lot. They seem to think nobody can see them if they hide their heads!) That was just before we scooped them all up to do health checks and pack them up. [Here's](http://imgur.com/Kia9pxY) the only pic I had time to snap during the health checks, [here](http://imgur.com/mB7RweZ) is a loggerhead butt, [here](http://imgur.com/mYk1BPs) we are loading sea turtles to the trucks, [here](http://imgur.com/h2IaILJ) is the back of the truck right now - you can just see 2 of the turtle crates and part of the NEAQ (New England Aquarium) lettering on the crates. All the turtles are in crates in the back.

PS I'm also a redditor but made a separate account for this event.

edit: 7pm, we just pulled into Baltimore to get more turtles. I have next driving shift, will answer questions on the shift after that

edit: 12:40am, National Aquarium van joined us at the last stop and led us around an awful traffic jam on I-95. And we just got the two Virginia turtles. So neat that at every place we've stopped the other people (with turtles) are there waiting for us. The Virginia Aquarium people had to stay up past midnight to meet us. 48 turtles now. Next stop South Carolina - those people are getting up at 4am to meet us and give us the two last turtles. 

edit: 5:30am. Reached Charleston. Last 2 sea turtles are [being loaded](http://imgur.com/NGGfQZf)! We're now at 50 turtles. The worst hours are behind us now, I think... we've been playing Trivial Pursuit for hours  now to stay awake. Loading up on coffee for the last leg.

I read everything Stephen King had ever wrote when I was eight years old and read *Moby Dick* when I was six. I could tell you every single event that happens in any of those books or any other book I've read.

I'm also an artistic and musical savant; I can draw or paint almost anything and have perfect pitch. I can spell and define any word I've ever read with (almost) no mistakes (and list off synonyms/antonyms pretty much as long as someone is willing to listen :D). I can remember the name of every author I've ever read and the title of every book they've ever written. 

Despite these gifts, I have severe difficulties navigating life because of my autism and am effectively a celibate recluse dependent on family members for support. About 90% of my communication with the outside world is through writing - I am almost totally nonverbal with everyone outside of my immediate first-degree family members. I have great difficulty making eye contact even with them. I do not exhibit normal body language and cannot interpret it in others. 

Any disturbance in my routine is extremely distressing to me, [to the point of emotional collapse and even self-harm.] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KeYf-rhMQIQ)

When I was a kid, before autism became widely recognized, the school wanted to medicate me and put me in special education. They considered my selective mutism, abnormal body language, and disorganization to be symptoms of mental retardation, despite near-perfect grades. My family refused and threatened to sue. 

Ask me anything. :) 

**UPDATE:** Went through my stuff from college and decided to post an [old piece of poetry] (http://www.reddit.com/r/Poetry/comments/1g0rg5/wooing_aquarius/) to /r/poetry so you could see I'm legit on that front. I also plan on adding a gallery of links to some photographs of my artwork tomorrow, after I borrow my sister-in-law's Galaxy for documentation. :D

[Autism Radio muthafukkahs!] (http://grooveshark.com/playlist/Autism+Radio/87407676) It's a playlist of the various kinds of music I listen to. For added dorkiness, I tried to pick songs which I feel speak directly to my experience as an autist and a savant.

Been at this for several hours now, and I feel like I've basically written an outline on a nonfiction book concerning the autistic experience/my biography at this point. Don't worry though, I fully intend to answer ALL of your questions. But I'm going to pick this up in the morning, after copious amounts of coffee. In the meantime, keep 'em coming!

**UPDATE 7:** 12:32 AM (6/12). Headed out for a late night (morning?) soda. The kind in a Styrofoam cup, with ice I can crunch. I'll probably go to bed soon. Thanks for all the questions, comments, and stories Reddit! If you have more, I'll happily answer them. :) 1:39 AM (6/12) Back. Drinkin' Pepsi. Added some music to Autism Radio, including this song, the best anthem I've found for people living with autism so far: **[Autists - we are all misfits living in a world on fire.] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWbMz_aBlMU)**

1347340727.0,216,self.AMA,zp19d,My ex-wife had an affair with an inmate at a medium security federal prison while she was his psychologist.  AMA,263,47,146,http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/zp19d/my_exwife_had_an_affair_with_an_inmate_at_a/,"I noticed that she was coming home from work talking about wanting to ""help this poor guy"" alot.... so I just started being more observant. Then, she asked if she could plan a trip away, by her self.... during Thanksgiving, which was a couple of weeks away. I reluctantly agreed because I had absolutely zero reason to not trust her at this point, but decided to do some investigation. The next day, I was at my desk at work, paying bills before heading home. I noticed on the cell phone bill that there was a recurring number. I picked up my desk phone and called the number. A man answered with a very non-legible accent. We'll call him ""Jose the Jalapeno"". I paid the cell phone bill and logged into our shared email account to look for the payment verification. When I logged in, I saw a receipt for a flight from Memphis to Miami during the Thanksgiving holiday. I knew that we didn't know anyone in Miami, and from doing some investigation I knew that this inmate that she came home talking about, was from Miami. I confronted her when she got home that night.

She initially denied it. I printed off the cell phone bill and flight itinerary before I left work, and started the conversation with ""Is there anything you need to tell me about. Anything at all?"" She said ""No."" I said ""Ok then, who's phone number is this?"" and pulled the phone bill out. She said She didn't know. I said ""Weird, because you spent xxx minutes talking to this person, and sent x,xxx texts to/from them.... and I know who's number it is, but you don't?"". I then asked her why she was going to Miami in a couple of weeks and I pulled that receipt out and showed it to her. She said ""Just to lay in the sun for a few days"". I said ""It doesn't have anything to do with this Miami number you've been talking to?"" She said ""No, not at all"".
She eventually fessed up, when I told her that I had a friend look up the current contact information for the inmate that she was ""so worried about"" that had been released the week before.
No, thankfully, we had no kids.... although we had been trying to have kids for about 2 years at this point, and were very close to having IVF done.

She's my ex. After she confessed, I felt the need to ""stand by her"" and fight for my marriage. I immediately called ""Jose"" from her cell phone, because I knew he'd answer. I told him that he needed to stop contacting my wife, a federal agent, and that if he ever contacted her again, that I'd drive to Miami, cut his nuts off and feed them to him. He could do nothing but grunt. I told him that was all I needed to hear, since it told me that he didn't love her. If he loved her, he would have the decency to talk to the husband of the woman he loves. He hung up. I immediately changed her cell phone number. I then told her that she needed to decide how she wanted to tell her employer, but that she definitely needed to tell them, because it would be used against her if she doesn't and they find out from someone else.
The next day, she went to work, and called me within an hour of arriving, saying that as soon as she stepped foot on the compound, an inmate approached her, saying that ""He wants to know if you're alright"". She then took the inmate into her office and he explained that eventually she would have to choose which side she was on, and he would appreciate it if she brought him some chocolate in from the outside, when she got back from lunch.
Apparently, Jose called one of his buddies, and asked them to check up on her.... which gave his buddies a reason to blackmail her, and start off with something inconsequential, that if she refused, they could rat her out, and get her arrested.
When she called me and told me this, I instructed her to go to the Warden's office, and I'll meet her there. We did this, and she confessed everything to an investigator. The Warden came in and gave her two options. 1.) she could resign now, and he could not guarantee that there wouldn't be charges for her later on or 2.) she could request an investigation, and it would almost certainly end in charges for her. She chose to resign.

We were married for about 6 years when this went down. After she resigned, Jose was put back in prison for compromising a federal agent. I asked her what she wanted.... to work this out with me, or move on and call it quits. She said she wanted to work it out with me, so we started going to counseling. I accepted a fair share of blame for not meeting her emotional needs, that she apparently needed met. We attended counseling for about a year.
The day before our 7th anniversary, we were sitting on the beach in Panama City, Florida. Her cell phone rang. She answered it and listened for a little while, then answered ""No"". I looked at her and asked ""Who is it?"" (I knew who it was, because I had asked to be notified by the government when he was released, but she didn't know this). She said ""It's him"" and handed me the phone. I took the phone and asked ""Who is this?"" and he hung up. I asked her what she answered ""No"" to. She said that he asked her if she could talk. I asked her what the answer would've been, had I not been sitting there....
Afterwards, we had a nice long talk about all that we had worked on in the year since this happened. I told her that all those counseling sessions that she sat in crying, saying she would undo it if she could, culminated right now. That I wasn't going to change her phone number again, and that she needed to tell him to not ever contact her again when he calls back, because he will eventually call back, when I'm not around.
Three days later we were back home. I was at work and she was at home. She called me, saying that he had just called and that I should be proud that she told me about it. I told her that I was, and I asked her if she told him what she needed to tell him. She said ""No, it didn't come up"". I said ""How long did you talk?"" She said ""about 3 hours"". I said ""That's plenty of time for it to come up."" She said ""Well, I'll tell him next time, we were catching up on how his family is doing, etc."" I said ""No, that's fine."" She replied ""Really? You can both be in my life?!?!?"" I said ""No, you can start packing your shit and get out of my house.""
She moved out within the week. The divorce was very easy. In fact, we used the same attorney. It was final in just over 30 days after getting back from the beach. I finally decided that she didn't have the courage to face her convictions of what she really wanted, and that it was getting to the point of being dangerous for me to protect her, because she obviously didn't have the same goals for us that I did.

hi there..

I saw your post and figured you can use some legitimate advice from someone who actually knows what they're talking about. I've run a Gynecology and Plastic Surgery clinic for about 6 years now and we perform abortions here on a daily basis.

First things first. I highly recommend you go to a private clinic instead of a hospital for many reasons: 1. cleanliness 2. quality of care 3. dependable staff 4. time

Now, depending on the size of the pregnancy you have 2 options. If you are less than 7wks then you can opt for the RU-486 pill, known as Mifepristone. This form of termination is a 2 day procedure where you will take the Mifepristone the first day and on the second you will take 4 others called Misoprostol. The first pill works by blocking the activity of progesterone, a substance your body makes to help continue pregnancy. The second set of pills induces labor and is what begins the process of something similar to a miscarriage.

Now most patients choose this procedure because it's less invasive and there is no anesthesia involved but you will endure painful cramping and have heavy bleeding as well as passing large blood clots.

Your other choice of course is a surgical termination which is a fairly simple and quick procedure. Depending on the clinic you go to they'll either do local anesthesia (you'll be awake for the procedure) or general (completely knocked out). I recommend doing general although you will feel groggy for almost the remainder of the day. The reason I say this is simply because the sounds of the machine they will use can be very uncomfortable and I believe its best to be completely unaware of whats going on during the procedure.

As far as the procedure goes, after they anesthetize you, the doctor will slightly dilate your cervix in order to insert the cannula, a small straw like suction device, and begin to remove the pregnancy. The procedure itself (depending on how many weeks you are) is only 5-10 minutes long but the anesthesia delays the process somewhat.

Afterward you will be bleeding and cramping, which is normal, so don't be afraid, and most likely very emotional. It's ok, don't feel silly or embarrassed. It's a difficult procedure to go through so just let it out if you have to.

Expect to have spotting for about 2wks or so until your regular period comes. Regardless of which of the 2 options you chose you will have bleeding.

Depending on the protocol of the clinic you are going to they will give you medication and have you return in 2-4 weeks for a follow up visit. This is very important because they need to verify that all tissue has been removed and that you are in fact no longer pregnant.

Last but not least.. forgive my language but fuck what everyone thinks.. they're not you, they don't know what you have going in your life, and they're not the one making the decision. So don't even fret about stupid people making obnoxious comments. If you need anything else or any more information you can call the clinic at [Phone number here] and speak to me directly. My name is George and I wish you the best of luck.

I hope you found this helpful

Now that thats over, I am a 26 year old guy who runs a Gynecology\Plastic Surgery clinic in NY. I've worked here for quite some time and seen\heard many incredible things. I've gone to school for phlebotomy and sonography and I do the ultrasound for every patient that comes through the clinic. I am pro-choice although watching people do things like having an abortion because their first born isn't a son or aborting a set of twins because they ""can't handle it"" does bother me (as it would bother anyone else.) If you have any questions please feel free to ask. If you're going to come on here spewing nonsense and garbage, I'll give you 2 syllables FUCK OFF.


**EDIT:** I'm really surprised that, despite all the nonsense going on between the past posts relating this topic, people are being a lot more understanding and calm rather than being abrasive and confrontational. Kudos to all of you. I'm also surprised nobody has asked me about how many women I've seen naked. That's always a hot topic around friends (and one that is quite annoying.)

I went onto webcam websites and would talk to people, sometimes guys, and they would talk to me. Some of them would ask me for nudes, but I would refuse. Until I ""met"" an 18 year old from Australia who began talking to me and getting to know me. I was so happy that I finally had someone to talk to; it made me feel much less lonely, as I never really talked to anybody irl. I continued talking to him for a few months, and began telling him some things about myself because I was young and naive and didn't know any better. Upon his request, I sent him a picture of my chest and he stopped talking to me after a while. I forgot about him as I slowly began transitioning into everyday life, and making some new friends in person. About 2 years later, I got a friend request from somebody named Michael ____. I didn't know them, so I didn't accept it. He messaged me, threatening to tell my father and sister (who were my listed as my relatives on facebook), and my other friends that were on facebook. He threatened to come to my school because he knew the town that I went to school in by looking at my friends list, and post the picture on various porn websites, unless I ""showed him more than my tits"". I was terrified and confused, I felt like I was going to throw up. I told my mom and she was infuriated. We brought the screenshots of the e-mails to the police, and they said they would investigate it, but it'd be hard because he lived in Australia. (I live in US). Many months went by without any mention of what had happened to him, until one day my mom got a call from the p.d. and they said that they'd got him. He was a 40 year old man living in Australia, and it turns out that they'd investigated his computer/house and found THOUSANDS of pornographic images of underage kids, both male and female.

AMA request",245,53,87,http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/143xhv/i_grew_up_with_a_mentally_handicapped_mother/,"My mother has been diagnosed as mildly MR and functions at a 2nd grade level for most things.  My father was never diagnosed, but was also MR with slight Mongolian features.  He died when I was 10 (on Christmas day btw!).  My sister is severely retarded, but I consider her a savant as she remembers EVERYTHING.  I came out normal for the most part, with a mild audio-deficit disorder, dyslexia, and poor short term memory.  (I also suck at spelling/grammar so forgive the errors) I scored 129 on the last WAIS-R IQ test I had to take (above average).

I had a miserable childhood, and am a strong advocate for sterilization.  I suffered physical, mental, and emotional abuse while under my mothers roof (she was the dominate one in the relationship).  I don't recall my father ever abusing us on his own, but my mother would often force him to participate.  We regularly had bloody backsides until DHS finally intervened when I was around four or five.  The abuse continued, however she was careful not to leave marks, and focused more on mental abuse.  For instance, she saw a news story where someone carved out their children's eyes, at which point she turned to me and threatened to do the same.  She often threatened to keep me home from school.  Once, she woke me up in the middle of the night, and tells me to leave, as she shoves me out the door in nothing but my underwear, in the middle of winter.  She would shake me till unconscious.  She would force me to participate in the torture and killing of small animals. etc...

It was often awkward when various social events required family participation.  I would often overhear this or that person explaining me and my parents to others.  My sister would often make a spectacle of herself in the audience during my school plays.  

After my father died, my sister was remitted to foster care a year or two later.  I was fortunate that an Aunt and Uncle moved here and intervened in my care giving, until I had enough and ran away.  After I became a ward of the court, they became my guardians.  I am great-full for their care, and love them like parents, but it was not easy living under their roof either. 

As for now... I find my mothers voice grating, like nails on a chalkboard, as she literally talks like a little girl.  I don't hate here or anything, but I have no emotional connection with her.  I see them both on holidays, and my mother calls on occasion.

Forgive me for avoiding details, as I have eidetic memory, and recall requires reliving the memory.

To summarise, I was stolen from my biological mother at age 3 by a manipulative family friend. The family friend raised me with repeated stories of being raped and abused by my biological family, which were so vivid they implanted horrific visual memories that I 'remember' to this day. 

I reacted mentally, and emotionally, as a rape victim. I've been through all of the symptoms a rape victim goes through, and I still suffer because of it, but I was never actually raped.
Ask me anything.

I like who I am and what I've been through made me that person. Given the choice, I'd do it again to be where I am today. Please don't be sorry for me. I'm not.

People from [this thread](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prebilovci_massacre) requested for me to do one, so here I am.

**If the mods need any proof, I will submit it ASAP, however I will have to do it privately as it involves things I wouldn’t want to be on the internet freely.**

My great-grandfather was killed by the Ustase in World War 2. He along with (about) 750 members of his village were taken to a large, natural pit, and thrown into it, falling to their death. You can read more about that [here.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prebilovci_massacre)

My great-grandmother was taken prisoner by the Italians (who collaborated with the Ustase) and was killed by an Italian firing squad in 1943.

My grandfather was a child when all of the above happened, so he ran (literally) from his former home day and night until he got to a safe place. He spent the war hiding as a child with very little food and malaria, but he survived. 

During the war in the 1990s, my grandfather (same one as above) was taken prisoner by modern Ustase for “being Serb” (he did not claim to be any nationality except Yugoslavian, and did not hold any religious beliefs). He was put in in a variety of prison camps close to where he lived and had lived. He was severely beaten, forced to watch killings, and almost executed several times. Him and his fellow prisoners were forced to do cruel and horrible tasks. 

The worst part of all of this was that the people who took him prisoner were his friends and people who he had taught in school (he was a high school principal/teacher).

He said that at one point he had been taken to be executed, but when the man assigned to kill him saw who he was, he refused to shoot because my grandfather was his high school teacher.

After somehow making it through and getting out alive, he developed dementia , and had 3 strokes as a result of his beatings, and died on his 4th.

Before he died however, he went back to the town where he lived before the war, and found that the people that had tortured and killed in those camps were walking around as free men, and when they saw him hardly walking in the street, they acted as if nothing happened.

He was at [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabela_camp), [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dretelj_camp) and [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliodrom_camp) camp during the war, along with a couple others.

Other things happened to my family but there are far too many to write in this box.

Before he could ask me for anything I invited him to the store and asked him what he wanted and told him I'd buy it. He said he wanted the big 32 oz cans of beer so I bought some too. He asked me for a ride just like right on my way so I said sure. In the car he asked ""if he could be bold and ask me for something"" which was a shower.

So, after really digging into these tests and realizing that I'm nowhere near gigabit speeds (even though I'm definitely getting speeds far above traditional broadband) I called up Google and after trouble shooting for a while they've decided they need to send a tech out to my house to really figure out why I'm not reading gigabit speed.

Good news: I'm already getting the first two months free and they also set up my account to have unlimited, free VOD movies until they make it out here. So I can rent as many pay-per view films as I want on the house. 

It's a nice gesture.

During my last 6 months of enlistment I was NJP'd for having more than the designated amount of alcohol in my barracks room. I had a few bottles of liquor, and I was only allowed to have up to a 6 pack. Was it wrong? Your damn straight it was. Do I regret it? I regret nothing. I got away with that for years just like everyone else. So I got busted down to E-2 (Pfc) and was just trying to finish out my time so I can get out and be a civilian again. Shortly after I was NJP'd again, because I failed to sign in my GF (now my wife) who was visiting me. Was that wrong too? Yep. Should I have just taken 5 seconds to sign her in? You bet your ass. Do I regret it? Not at all, that story is fucking hilarious.

So now everyone knows why I got out as a Private. Judge me if you have to. I did my time, got out honorably, didn't break any serious rules (drugs, theft, rape, murder, etc etc), and I didn't fuck any of my friends over, ever.  Some of the people who are doxxing and speaking out against me are the very people I kept my mouth shut about doing things far worse than I ever played part in.",,False,,t5_2r4eo,1365617820.0,,,True,t3_1bxiz9,http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/1bxiz9/i_am_a_former_marine_and_creator_of/,

I was homeschooled by my Aunt along with my two cousins.  When I was 16, though, my aunt and uncle requested legal custody so they could pay for me to go to a private school for high school.  My parents refused and became angry and ""took me back"".  When I got home they gave me a camper that was parked in the back yard as my home.  No running water, but I did have electricity.

You may be surprised to find out that people who join ""cults"" (how i categorize the Unification Church) are more likely to have a college degree than not. They were matched (put in a room full of people while the leader Rev. Moon literally just paired up people), they barely knew each other, but i and my six siblings are the result. We are all out of the church.

About myself. I was always a very faithful believer. At the age of 17 there was a matching going on by Rev. Moon (very rare during that time) and i really wanted the company of a girl and figured it was the next step so i decided to go. I was matched to a girl who i really did not find attractive, physically and emotionally. For certain reasons this shocked me and sent me on a long path of questioning. At the age of 19, after fundraising for the church illegally in europe for a year, in my first semester of college i broke it off with her and broke off with the church.

Ask me anything you like, my parents have been in the church for 40 years each (still are), there is little i don't know about.

Edit: welp i guess somebody beat me to the punch, but i'll stick around if anyone wants another perspective.

Edit2: gaining momentum here, thanks for all the questions!

Edit3: Fun fact: The Unification Church has a huge religious complex in Korea called ""cheon pyung""
 where people go for often extended periods of time (weeks to months) and  join in mass sessions where they hit themselves all over there body (ALL over), to get the ""bad spirits out"" while they all sing church music. Its quite bizarre when you see it.

I was warned against it by my family and friends, but being so young I thought I knew everything.


She came from a fairly dysfunctional family and was used to getting things her way. Her father was abusive to her sister and mother, as well as her. She would often turn viciously violent and many times threaten to kill herself. I came home from work three times to find her mid-attempt, Twice she tried to hang herself and the third time I had to drive her to the hospital to get her stomach pumped as she had swallowed a lot of pills.


During this time i was out of work due to the construction industry being in a down-turn, and to deal with the stress of not knowing when another attack was coming relied heavily on alcohol. A silly decision on my part. She had a full-time job at a freight company. I only found out a couple of months ago that she had been lying to me about her wage and had been keeping half of it for herself, while all our bills were paid for from my savings and whatever welfare support i was on at the time. This may seem like I'm being selfish, her wage was hers to do with what she pleased, but we had a joint bank account and agreed we would both contribute our whole wage to this account. We made this agreement back before I had been made redundant and was on a very good wage. One of her main reasons for being so angry was that we struggled financially, but we wouldn't have if she had been honest.


I had a restraining order against her while we were still married after a particularly bad beating for losing my bank card. She left our unit after assaulting me and vandalising my car, and was running up the street screaming. The police were called by our neighbours after hearing the screaming coming from our unit. They thought it was me who was attacking her, until she came back and despite the presence of the police had another go at me.


I finally gathered the courage to leave her when i was held at knife point by her in our kitchen and was told that if I ever had contact with my family again (who she despised) she would kill me. I had found out after I had left her and moved back to my parents that she had been writing threats to my parents and signing them from me.

1350199668.0,145,self.AMA,11gbeo,As Requested: I stayed with my spouse after he transitioned from female-to-male AMA. ,178,33,86,http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/11gbeo/as_requested_i_stayed_with_my_spouse_after_he/,"[Requested here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/11fi3n/ama_request_someone_who_stayed_with_their/)

Answering the questions asked:

1. I had dated women for about five years. So being around lesbians all the time (and a general dismissal of bisexuality as a ""real"" thing among them) I was labeled lesbian and just went with it. During the transition I used ""Queer"" as a blanket term as I knew I wasn't lesbian but I wasn't sure what I was. Now I identify pansexual if I must label myself, I really prefer no labels. 

2. We got legally married in Washington DC. We live in Texas so we weren't seen as legally married here. In Texas, one cannot change their birth certificate but only amend it. Marriage is between one female and one male at birth. Still not seen as married and its unfortunate. 

3. No kids. (Hey r/childfree)

4. Emotionally? Even better than before. When someone has a hatred for themselves, their body and entire being it definitely is difficult for one to be happy with themselves much less a relationship. He is happier, walks with his head proud (for once in his life), proud of himself and the changes happening. Our intimacy is much stronger as he is a whole person finally, along with the fact we have done this together. We have been through everything and are still going strong. Also I give him his shots so its kept me in the transition as well. Physically? He is stronger, more manly, sexier and a changed lover. 

5. The most challenging would be the coming out to people and the adjustment phase. Making his family understand this isn't his attempt to make their lives hell. He isn't doing this to hurt them... He isn't selfish. This is for his survival. This isn't anything he is doing to them but for himself. 

6. We are normal folks. He is a man. He is a ""real"" man. I have had folks be asshole and say ""he's never going to be a real man"" and such. Terrible. He is a man just had to adjust the outside to fit the inside. Just had to work a little harder than to simply be born! Also take into account LGBT rights when voting. Employers need to have gender identity in their anti discriminatory statements and we deserve to be legally married as any other couple!

Ask us anything!

Edit: I am female. He is male. Clarification :)

Edit 2: for any partner of FTMs there is a Facebook group with a [youtube channel](http://www.youtube.com/FTMsweethearts) and for MTF/FTM there is a couples Facebook group called trans couples that are both really supportive of the struggles both trans folks and their partners go through.

Edit: I want to thank everyone who have asked questions. I think only one comment was ill mannered. That's saying something for reddit! But on a serious note, thank you for the questions!

AMA. ,190,51,132,http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/xzklq/sexual_assault_therapist_discussing_orgasmarousal/,"A discussion on another post led to someone suggesting I try an AMA on it.  This is a somewhat altered version of a response I gave to their question.  (and be kind, I haven't done this before)
 
The concept of arousal and orgasm during rape/sexual assault is a confusing and difficult one for many girls.  Many people don't believe it's possible, or think it means that it wasn't rape or the girl ""wanted"" it.

I work in this field with children, minors and some adults. I've assisted more young women than I can count with this very issue. It usually comes up later in therapy; something they ""need"" to ask me. And it's usually along the lines of ""Does this mean I liked it?""

The shame, the guilt is a HUGE factor and I often know when it has happened by the way they dance around certain topics. This is when I'll bring it up as gently as I can, initially to denial or crying, then opening up about what really happened.

As to the intensity, multiples, not experiencing it prior, all true.  I don't have numbers handy, but I'd say it's at least half of the girls/women I've worked with talk about arousal and orgasm at some point. Whether this means it's really higher and some just don't overcome the shame, I don't know. 

It is a topic of discussion amongst survivor counselors/therapists and fairly consistent from those I've talked to. Some therapists don't talk about this publicly as they fear contributing to the idea of ""women enjoying rape"" but as hard as it is, I think if we can remove this taboo, a lot more healing can happen. Thanks for posting a difficult topic.

**Edit:** If redditors wish to ask me anything on this, I don't mind answering.
**Edit 2:** I apologize for only mentioning women/girls. Obviously, this occurs with men/boys as well.
**Edit 3:** I removed the ""as long as it's not offensive"" from Edit 1. I realize many people have questions/thoughts they want to express and might not because they are afraid of being offensive.

Long story short, after the VCD format created a de facto standard for digital video on the internet, pirates started digitizing movies and swapping them. People who had access to Academy Award screeners and the like became popular enough that they could form groups and be accepted into the ""scene"" (which until then had been concerned only with games and applications). 

Early TV shows were traded amongst fans, which meant that around 1997 there were unconnected trading groups on Usenet and IRC for shows like Star Trek, Earth 2, etc. These shows were typically ripped from VHS releases (Star Trek was notoriusly slow to DVD) or from syndicated reruns. Sometimes there would be rips directly from the first airing, but there was no system or consistency - or any real demand.

In 1999, the first season of Futurama went on air. Because of the popularity of Matt Groening and the science fiction theme, and because of technological development, some enterprising individuals ripped the first airings and spread them on the internet, consistently ripping each episode as it aired and uploading it shortly thereafter. One of these people attracted the attention of the VCD scene, as the format of the rip made it easy to slot into the existing scene infrastructure, and around the fall of 1999 the first tvrip group, ANiVCD, started releasing Futurama, The Simpsons, and Family Guy in a ""scene"" fashion, which is to say that each episode would be ripped in realtime (using a hardware MPEG encoder card), packaged into rar files, tagged with the group name and an nfo file, and uploaded - ""pred"" into the scene. 

Anyone could have done it - which meant that after ANiVCD had created the proof of concept and sites had created a tv section, dozens of groups popped up to try to stake a claim to ""their"" shows and release them. The competition between these groups was judged in the normal manner of the scene, which is to say that the first group to put out a correct release was deemed the winner, receiving kudos and digital high fives. The current state of the tvrip scene, with shows released to the internet minutes after air is a result of these ten years of competition. This is actually slower than the fastest days, where ""preair"" (rips from the satellite distribution network of the stations themselves) would enable rips to be put out the night before the show was due to air.

I planned on going away to college and planned on becoming a nurse. Two weeks before i decided to leave my parents, who own a bakery, asked me if i wanted to start and run my own restaurant/cafe for them. At the time I had just blown them off with that idea that they had thrown at me. After three weeks of being at college I came to the realization that I have a better work ethic than most students at my school. I was accustomed to working and going to school at the same time. Also lingering in my thoughts was the amount of debt that i would accumulate if i went to this college for four years. So I made the phone call to my parents, packed my bags and headed home from college to go out on my own business venture. I invested 60% of the money that I had planned on using for college into the business and within three weeks we were open. It's now been two weeks that we've been open and we struggle to keep our inventory stocked. Not a bad thing right? I hired my own waiting staff and also unfortunately fired some people also. I work 10-14 hours a day so i'll try to answer as many questions as I can!

Why do I call bullshit:

First, he offered no proof. No one pushed him on it, I guess that is because he is a ""priest.""

Second, all his answers were general.

Third, **and most importantly** he was *profoundly* ignorant about a comment I made.

.

There was a comment about how the church treats women (not very well).  I gave the following quote  by Thomas Aquinas:

*""As regards the individual nature, woman is defective and misbegotten, for the active power of the male seed tends to the production of a perfect likeness in the masculine sex; while the production of a woman comes from defect in the active power. ""*

— Saint Thomas Aquinas

.

The ""priest"" answered my by replying:

""I must have missed the class where St. Thomas Aquinas was the font of truth.""

.

This is profoundly ignorant, as St Thomas is one of only 33 ""doctors"" in the entire history of the church. He is the *model* for priests according to *Canon Law* and St. Thomas is the patron saint of education. Kind of contradicts his snarky ""didn't know Thomas was the font of truth"" remark. If he was a true priest, he would know Aquinas is one of the most important catholic thinkers/philosopher. Of course, he *might* be the shittiest priest *ever* known to humankind, but I'm betting 4chan troll.

.

Here is the link to the our exchange:

http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/va55e/iama_roman_catholic_priest_and_have_been_one_for/c52slzw?context=3

.

**EDIT:** Even though the ""priest"" said he was signing off and was done with the AMA, he is starting to feel the heat and just answered my claims. Notice he offered no citations, nor any proof. The person is a troll, and trolled 6000+ people.

http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/va55e/iama_roman_catholic_priest_and_have_been_one_for/c52uvi4

.

**EDIT 1:** The basis of all of this is because the priest would did not offer proof, according to the rules of /r/IAmA. If the priest just would have followed the rules, this would have been avoided. And he is well aware of the rules.

I wrote this post because I was concerned that he was a troll - maybe someone going to brag back at 4chan. For all I know, there were people sending him PM with their confessions. There were 9000+ people taking this idiot at his word. I was trying to protect the people in the /r/IAmA post. A am an ardent atheist, but I was trying to protect those who might have been taken advantage of a hoax.  Furthermore, what the priest did was set a precedence that those who claim to be religious do not have to show proof. What person would want to ask someone for proof of their priestiness after seeing the bullshit I have taken here. Oh, well, maybe *I'll* go on to the IAmA subreddit and claim to be a priest without showing any proof, too. Wouldn't you all like *that?*


Look at the requirements of the IAMA:

http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/

.

Ask the OPs to provide proof, and upvote those who do!

**Verification System**
**You must** provide proof of your identity **in the body of your post** when you submit your IamA.

The priest knew this. He did not prove or verify his identity until I wrote this post. In a great part, I wrote it in order to provoke the douchebag scumbag priest. I was hoping it might provoke a response and proof, and it did, as confirmed by spez.

A few points to start off with...  

* I see only in black, white, and shades of gray.  I only know this through figuring it out since, having never seen colors, I have no basis for comparison.  TV was a big help in figuring it out.  I'd watch Gilligan's Island and my friends were all like ""OH, this one's in color!"" and I was like ""Really?  Looks the same to me.""  When I was a teenager, the show ER did an episode in black &amp; white.  I didn't even know that until halfway through the episode when my girlfriend mentioned it.  Because I see in all the shades of gray and have never known ""real"" color, I do think of everything as being ""colorful"" to me.  It's what Achromats call the ""illusion of color.""  

* Because the photoreceptor cells responsible for color vision are also the ones responsible for fine detail and distance vision, I'm also legally blind with a Snellan rating of 20/200 in normal lighting and 20/300 (or worse) in bright outdoor lighting.  In dimly lit conditions, my vision is 20/160 so I'm not technically legally blind then.

* The photoreceptor cells responsible for color and detail vision are also those responsible for our ability to see in daylight.  They are called Cone cells.  I only have Rod photoreceptors, which are what your eyes use for low light or darkness.  Due to this, I am extremely photophobic (light sensitive).

* The final symptom of Achromatopsia is called Nystagmus or ""wobbly eyes.""  If you were to look closely at my eyes, you'd see that they seem to ""vibrate"" slightly at all times.  I never notice this unless I let my vision go out of focus and then my eyes will shake noticeably.

I tried to capture the essence of what things look like for me by editing some photos.  It is not a *perfect* representation, but it's the closest I could come.

Ask us anything!",183,65,239,http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/1aeqo7/we_are_rtulpascreators_of_sentient_imaginary/,"**First and foremost: please read our FAQ [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Tulpas/wiki/faq) and if you have a question about terms used, there is a glossary [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Tulpas/wiki/glossary)**

###What is a tulpa?

Nobody can quite agree on an *exact* definition, but a popular definition used in our guides, FAQs and glossary reads:

&gt;A tulpa is believed to be an autonomous consciousness, existing within their creator’s mind, often with a form of their creator's initial choice and design.  
&gt;A tulpa is entirely sentient and in control of their opinions, feelings, form and movement.  
&gt;They are willingly created by people via a number of techniques to act as companions, muses, and advisers.

Put simply, a tulpa is a sentient imaginary friend. The key difference is that, unlike the classic idea of an imaginary friend, a tulpa does not do exactly what you want it to do. A tulpa possesses independent thought processes and forms its own opinions. This is generally taken as the mark of sentience in the tulpa community. That said, the definition of sentience is disputed and varies, both within the tulpa community and in general.

One common way to experience and spend time with a tulpa is to visualize what they look like in a “wonderland,” also called a dreamscape or mindscape, where you can hang out together. A wonderland is a persistent mental environment, easily recalled and visualised. Wonderlands are not strictly necessary, though they can be convenient or relaxing.

A tulpa, once created, can communicate with you at any time. They are almost always present in some form, even when idle or not paying attention. Communicating with a tulpa can be done vocally (obviously in a private place!) or mentally, simply directing your thoughts towards them and keeping your mind open. Responses may be as simple as an emotional impulse, a full coherent response (people often ascribe an ‘external’ or ‘alien’ quality to such responses), or even full auditory hallucination of speech. Initially, communication is quite limited, and it takes months of practice to improve. While some part of them remains ever-present, tulpa are typically responsive to their creator’s wishes and can divert their attention and communication if their creator is socializing with others or wishes to be alone.

Tulpa aren’t a replacement for human social contact, but a means of personal insight, improved perspective, and companionship outside of your usual social life. While some may seek to use a tulpa in lieu of a social life and a wonderland instead of experiencing reality, we don’t condone or encourage that, and if you try to anyway you’re likely to find your own mental schism admonishing you for such escapist behaviour!

Ultimately, each tulpa is unique and distinct to the mind of their creator and host, so while we can assert generalities, specifying the exact how and why of tulpa is beyond our current capabilities. We are seeking answers through collaboration and comparison, and hopefully we can share some of our individual and collective insights and experiences in this AMA.

###How are tulpas created? What are their psychological effects?

There are too many conflicting theories to list them all. The two most notable current theories can be called “Enhanced Imaginary Friends” and “Deliberate Dissociation.” The former holds that the tulpa phenomenon is a simple extension of the human imagination, and the creation of independent consciousness is a natural capability of the human brain; the latter suggests that tulpa are a fragmentation of your original psyche, rather than a creation.

The dissociation model provides the main argument against tulpa. Dissociation (“a feeling of detachment from reality”) is closely linked with many negative experiences, leading many to conclude it cannot be creatively engaged with in a safe manner. That said, if creating tulpa *is* dissociation, then it is a comparatively safe form. Although dissociation has a slew of problems broadly associated with it, you cannot *think yourself* into a mental disorder. Those are caused by severe trauma or a chemical imbalance in your brain, not attempting to focus and personify a part of your mind.

It is worth mentioning that some people have created tulpa spontaneously, often in their early teenage years, and others have a ‘natural talent’ for creation. There’s at least one person in our community whose tulpa was talking to them coherently within their first hour of attention. Tulpa numbers range from one or two per person to upwards of 20 tulpas in a single person’s mind!

There is significant anecdotal evidence crediting tulpa with feats of perception, memory recall, mental arithmetic skill, and social awareness. More research is needed before making any actual claims in order to differentiate the benefits of tulpa from the general improved awareness that occurs as a result of sustained visualization exercises.

###The metaphysical side

Very few members of the community associate with metaphysical, occult, or supernatural ideas about this phenomena. It’s generally accepted that tulpas are extensions or part of your subconscious, not “headmates,” divine spirits sent from nature, ghosts, thetans, or parallel universe projections of characters from fiction. Our community *does* talk to and tolerate those with esoteric beliefs, but hard as it may be to believe, we are skeptics ourselves and try to remain wary of the more extreme and outlandish claims.

###Groups in the tulpa community

There are several groups of people within the tulpa community. The most obvious is the [My Little Pony (MLP) community](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Little_Pony:_Friendship_Is_Magic_fandom). While tulpa as a term began life in the western studies of Tibetan Buddhism, it was (much) later picked up on 4chan by /x/ (Paranormal), where it existed as a series of discussion threads before being overwhelmed by ‘creepypasta’ horror stories and the occult. Tulpa discussion moved to /mlp/ (originally via discussions regarding lucid dreaming) where it was popularized, many tulpa taking their form or name from characters based on the show. A smaller number of people have accidentally created ‘religious’ tulpas by talking to themselves through prayer, or ‘natural’ tulpa created through isolation and stress. We could keep getting into the specific niches (anime derived tulpas, fantasy novel derived tulpas etc.) but the variation and imaginative range is vast - there’s at least one tulpa with a human body and a microwave for a head. According to a survey taken within the subreddit, just over half of all respondents have human or humanoid tulpa, about a quarter drawing on cartoon/anime sources. Animal forms and unusual forms, including multi-formed shapeshifting tulpa, make up the remainder. Of course, we only speak for /r/Tulpas, not other websites and communities - but we did just pass 2000 subscribers!

###Evidence for tulpa

While only a starting point, we have some interesting [EEG readings](http://www.reddit.com/r/Tulpas/comments/18dxzs/eeg_data_and_tulpa/) and more to come on that front. We also have the [Stanford article on what we consider to be religiously-created tulpas](http://news.stanford.edu/news/2012/april/conversations-with-god-041212.html).

Unfortunately, beyond that, most of us only obtained evidence of this when we tried it for ourselves, and then compared and contrasted our experiences with others. If you don’t consider the tulpa phenomenon to be real, that’s fine, but it is our belief regardless of whether we can prove it or not. We welcome healthy skepticism and critical analysis, provided you’re reasonable and have read what we’ve had to say first. We hope we can shed some light on this unusual subject by answering your questions!

Hey Reddit,

Dr. Drew and ""Psycho"" Mike, the hosts of Loveline,  are standing by and ready to take your questions about Loveline or anything else you'd like to ask about.

If you're not familiar with it, Loveline is a nationally syndicated call in advice show that's been on for nearly 30 years with a focus on relationships, sex, and addiction. The show also aired on MTV (with then co-host Adam Carolla) from '96 to '00.

We'll answer what questions we can get to tonight (we're in studio for another hour) and will continue tomorrow if the questions keep coming.  (Questions/answers will be relayed to/from Mike and Drew by Loveline's web guy, Tyler)

On a serious note, someone asked me what caused this.  Here is the general description.

The condition is called ""VACTERL"" Association. It is an acronym where each letter describes a part of the body that it could affect.

* V: Vertebral (I have a missing vertebral disk in my upper back, fusing 2 vertebrae. This limits my swivel range of my neck(
* A: Anal (Anal Atresia and Imperforate Anus are both very common conditions, although I dodged this one.)
* C: Cardiac (Most commonly congenital heart defects. This is the MOST common part of VACTERL, and one of the leading causes of death for infants with VACTERL. I dodged this as well.)
* TE: Tracheo-Esophegial (I was born with my throat not connected to my stomach, and required surgery immediately.)
* R: Renal (Kidney failure is HUGE with VACTERL, and almost every case of it includes renal problems. Again, I dodged a bullet here. No kidney problems at all
* L: Limbs (This is the single most obvious sign of VACTERL. Obviously this was my big one.)

Due to the most common problems being cardio and renal problems, most children die of this. I am one of VERY few in the world who has survived past pre-teens. I am currently 23 and healthy as an ox.",,False,,t5_2r4eo,1370995926.0,,,True,t3_1g3b1p,http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/1g3b1p/due_to_a_genetic_condition_i_have_3_fingers_on_my/,

It reminded me of my time shoplifting. Between the ages of 12 and 15 me and my friends used to shoplift for fun. We called it ""borrowing"" to make it seem like less of a crime. We were all middle class white teens who lived in the suburbs during the 1980s. Our parents bought us everything we needed so we didn't steal out of necessity. We just shoplifted for the thrill. Eventually, we were caught and punished. If you do it long enough you will get busted.

Our motto was: ""The most obvious is the most un-obvious.""

We figured the more blatant the theft was the less obvious it would be to security and to the shoppers around us. We used to make stealing a game. The object was to total up the dollar value of the merchandise and whoever stole the highest amount during that day won. To us, the thrill was potentially getting caught. We didn't really care about the stuff we were stealing. Most of it we gave away.

Here's one story of our shoplifting:

We walked into a Toys-R-Us. A friend of mine steals an X-acto knife from the hobby section, rips the package open, and then climbs a shelf and cuts down a giant radio controlled truck from a display hanging 12 feet up on the wall. Then, he climbs back up and cuts down the remote control. (While he was up there some shopper assumed we worked there and asked directions). He stuffs both those items down his baggy pants and covers it with his coat. Then, we head over to the battery department and steal a shitload of batteries and he waddles out the front door. (He can barely walk because of all the shit in his pants). The door greeter tells us: ""Please come back"" and we laugh and assure him that we will.

Some techniques we used to shoplift:

 * Create a diversion. Have one of your friends act real shady and sneak around and put stuff in his pockets and pants in front of the security camera. Get them to follow him around the store. While they're busy following him you can clean up and walk out the front door. He just has to empty his pockets before he leaves. They stop and frisk him and he has nothing (It's really fun if he makes a huge scene and starts accusing the security guards of harassment).

 * Switch price tags. This one worked surprisingly well back in the 1980s. You would just find some other item that was cheaper and switch the price tags with something that you wanted. $50 fishing reel? Not today. It's on sale as a $1.99 tent peg!

 * Wear adjustable and baggy clothing. The best were BDU army pants with the draw-string waste straps and no belt. This way you could expand your waist dimensions and put large items down your pants. The added bonus was that they also had ankle ties to prevent stuff from falling out of your pant legs while walking. Just be sure that it doesn't rattle or make noise.

 * Look like them. Planning to rip off Best Buy? Put on a pair of khakis and a blue polo shirt. You might get asked to help out but, they probably won't suspect you of stealing.

 * Wear a baggy coat. This only works in cold weather climates in the winter. If you live in Florida and are wearing a parka in July they are going to get suspicious. But, a big coat over baggy pants makes it really hard to see what's in your trousers.

 * Put things inside of other things. This worked really well with electronics. You could rip open one box and stick it inside another. Having a keychain razor blade helps. This way you can cut open the plastic bubble packs. Buying something that needs batteries? Why not add a little something extra to the battery compartment on the way out? This method works great for jewelry.

 * The old switch-a-roo. Similar to ""things inside of other things"". If you stuff a DVD box down your pants you'll set off the alarm. But, if you rip open a pack of CDRs and swap one out for the DVD movie you can check out safely. They ring you up for one 50 pack of CDRs for $10. You get 49 and a movie. 

 * Stick it in under something. You pop a gold chain in your mouth and put it under your tongue. Grab something and put it under your hat. Go ahead mall cop... search my pockets. I've got nothing! 

 * Make a mess. This is sort of like the diversion technique but, instead of pretending to steal you act rowdy and make a big mess. Knock over a display. Start playing football in the store. All the employees and the security guards will be looking at you while your friends walk out the front door with big ticket items.

 * Hold it in your hand. Small items that can be held in your hand become yours as you walk out the door. Grab a package, rip it open, carry it around with you, and walk right out the door. ""What are you talking about? I walked in here with this Zippo lighter... it's mine!""

 * Wear it. Want a baseball cap? Who doesn't? Pop it on your head and walk right out the door. Be sure to cut the tag off it and check for hidden security measures.

 * Listen for announcements. There is usually a code word they use in security to draw attention to people stealing. They won't say: ""Thief in aisle 12"". It's more likely to be something like: ""Housewares dial 4-1-9"". Listen to department names. Do they match where you are or have been? If so, they are probably on to you. Also, listen for odd sounding announcements. It could be a warning.

 * Look out for plain clothes. Most of the mall cops and security guards wear uniforms. But, some of them don't. If you see someone watching or following you he (or she) is probably security. It could be a woman or an old guy or a long haired dude with a frat shirt. Test the theory by putting something in your pocket. Go to another area of the store. Did they follow you? Are they still watching you? If so... ditch the item from your pocket and leave.

 * Own it. Walk right into a store, head over to the electronics department, pick up a TV box, and walk right out the front door, nobody will say a damn thing. Most people assume that you're supposed to be doing that or that you bought it. Nobody would be that obvious if they were stealing something, right? 

 * Set it up for later. Most stores have a changing of the guard when all the employees and security guards switch shifts. Get your item all ready to go but, don't take it. Go to the food court. Have lunch. Then, come back during the shift change and grab your item. The new people didn't see you earlier and they won't be looking for you.

 * Bring a Sharpie. Write your name on it. Seriously. Peel off the price tag and write your name on it. If the security guard stops you say: ""Oh, no, this is mine. I brought it to make sure that I buy the right one for my uncle."" This works great for tools.

 * Throw it away. This one is risky because you might not get it. But, what have you got to lose? Bring a pack of orange stickers. Put one on the trash bag. Then, throw the item you want in the trash and hope someone doesn't throw a slurpee in there. Later, that night pull up and dig through the dumpster for the tagged bag.

 * Make friends on the inside. The biggest theft at a company probably comes from their own employees. If your friend works for a company you can get a lot of info about how security works. Plus you have a built in excuse for being there. ""I'm just here to visit my friend.""

 * Unload often. After you steal stuff from one store go to the car or parking lot and unload it. That way if you get caught at the next store they will only find the stuff you stole from that place. You don't want to get busted with stuff from 5 different stores in your pocket at once.

 * High and low. One hand is up above the counter pointing at something to the store employee while the other hand is down low ripping open a box or stuffing it down your pants. Who would be crazy enough to steal something right in front of a store employee?

 * Bring a key chain that has a mini tool on it. (Like those leatherman tools). This way you have access to a blade, a scissors, a screwdriver, and a pair of pliers. You can use these to remove packaging or alarm tags. 

 * Wear a watch. You can slide long, thin things up your sleeve and tuck it under your watch band to hold it in place. This way you can move your arms around without worrying about it falling out.

 * False bottom cup. Stop by the food court. Get 2 cups: one big one small. Put one inside the other. Put liquid in the small one. Steal small shit and drop it inside the big one. Walk around the store drinking your tasty beverage. 

 * Wear a hoodie. Serves 2 purposes: first you can pull it up over your head/face in case there are cameras and second you can actually drop stuff in the hood. It makes the perfect pocket that usually doesn't get searched. They'll have you empty your pockets but, forget to check inside the hood.

 * Strong magnets. A lot of times those ""security"" strips that they put into packages are just magnetized. Carry a real strong rare earth magnet with you and rub it over the strip a view times. 

 * Diversion alarm trigger. Throw something in your bag that you know causes the alarm to go off (like CDs or DVDs). Then, if you set the alarm off for real with something else in your pockets they'll be less likely to suspect you because you have items that constantly trigger the alarm.

 * The hardest things to steal are: Clothes, CDs, DVDs, small electronics, jewelry. These are the things that get stolen the most and that are tagged with sensors or trackers.  Try to go for other stuff. Get smaller, more expensive items that are easier to steal. Bring them back to a different store and get a refund. (Tell them it was a birthday gift and that you don't have a receipt). Use the money to buy stuff you really want. 

Eventually, after about 4 years we got busted by security in a Target. But, because we were white minors from the suburbs with no priors, they let us go with a misdemeanor and 100 hrs. community service. I stole tens of thousands of dollars worth of shit and so did my friends and we got away with it for years. I haven't stolen anything since. I'm not proud of doing this. In fact, I regret it. By doing this, I caused prices to go up for everyone (including me). I really hope my kids don't grow up doing stuff like this. There was a loss prevention officer in the other thread who suggested that I do this AMA. Hopefully people can learn from my mistakes. Stealing might seem exciting but, you will get caught.

Later, my friends and I got into drugs and found they were way more exciting than stealing. (Note: I'm completely reformed and sober and have been for many years. I don't steal or do drugs anymore.)",,False,,t5_2r4eo,1356701874.0,,,True,t3_15kfcm,http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/15kfcm/me_and_my_friends_used_to_shoplift_for_fun_ama/,

She raised my brother and I, a lot of the time below the poverty line. She had no retirement plan and she was nearing 50. At the time, I was an aspiring actor and had no way of helping out financially.

I decided to embark on a two year challenge to retire her, by earning one million dollars. Retiring her is defined by buying her a house (20% downpayment, covering the mortgage for the first 3 years upfront), a car (this old 1970's saab - the car she's always wanted), and sending her on a world trip (she's never travelled). I've been self-filming it and I'm going to turn it into a documentary when it's done. The title of the documentary is 'Millionaire By 25'. The website is: http://millionaireby25.com. Facebook is: http://facebook.com/millionaireby25

I'm 17 months in out of 24, and I've interviewed 10+ millionaires (Pat Flynn, Chad Mureta, to name a few), was on CreativeLIVE (internet TV) as a guest for Tim Ferriss' event, guest lectured at McGill University's High Tech Entrepreneurship class, made an inspirational video that went viral on world star hip hop that, started 3 businesses, earned nearly $100,000, and amassed an online following of 40,000 people for my challenge.

I can answer any questions you have, but I would say I have expertise in the following:

- How to reach hard-to-reach people
- How to build an online following
- How to thrive without formal education
- How to set goals and get your life in order
- How to outsource
- How to make and market apps
- How to make and market eBooks

AMA,135,41,142,http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/1j31f9/i_am_writing_a_letter_to_the_man_that_killed_my/,"When I was 2 years old, my mother was murdered by a man who is currently serving life in prison. Because my adoptive parents (biological grandparents) are not giving me answers, I am going to the source. I am scared that I may not get any answers, or open a door that I wish didn't exist. I have had no prior contact with this man. Some support, or anyone who has done the same or similar would mean the world to me right now. 

Edit 1: The story I was given (watered down I am sure) about her death: This happened when I was two years old, and I am 20 now. I believe that it was around 1995 near September, my adoptive mother has never given me a solid date. I will give you the short detached version since it is easier on myself.. She was living with this man and they were both amendment users of Meth. Apparently he was a pretty controlling and prone to anger. My mother decided to leave him one day, already having placed my brother and I somewhere safe (I have no idea where to this day and even then it may not be true), she left their house. She was very fond of animals (as am I), and decided to go back home for her Dog. While driving away he apparently drove up behind her and knew what was going on. He got mad and poured gasoline on her, and set her on fire. She ran into a field (this is Arkansas) ablaze, where neighbors called the cops because a strange fire. She was air flighted to a hospital, and treated for about a month before passing away. She may have survived if her immune system wasn't so terrible due to the drugs.

Edit 2: The only online article I have found about her (it begins about midpage with ""On Sept. 8, 1995): http://www.carrollconews.com/story/1386315.html

I was born and raised in Germany, in a small town in the Taunus (West Germany, forresty hill country, kinda). My mom is american (her dad was U.S Airforce stationed in Germany) and my dad is Croatian (came over to Germany when he was 12).

I grew up speaking German, going to German schools and having German friends. pretty much, for all intents and purposes, I am *pretty damn German*.

When I was 16 I moved to the states for the first time, year abroad in a u.S High School in Arizona. Then after that I moved to London, where my mom had just relocated with my step dad. I completed my A-levels, took my first real job and lived it up in London for a while. 

Then When I was 20 I moved to Florida to get my Pilots licence, fully aware that whatever happened, I would probably not come back to Europe for a while.

I'm Still here. Not in Florida because that state is just vile, but in San Francisco, one of the nicest places I have ever lived.

True, the social system in the States is generally awful, the public transit in most places can not be relied upon, religious fanatics are everywhere, I get no paid vacation times at my Contract Q.A Testing gig and there is no decent Döner kebab around. 

And yet... I still choose to live here in the United States. I could easily go back to the U.K or Germany, both places I have family living at and could easily acquire a work visa and accommodation. In fact, flights would be paid for and my meager belongings could be sold and/or shipped with ease. Still here though, still in this place that so many redditors seem to hate so much and seemingly *just can not* escape.

There are so many reasons why its nice to live here, from the mundane things like taking a right at a red light to the amazing, like late night street Tacos, the United States has so much to offer. Or maybe California and San Francisco have a lot to offer. Either way, I like it here and am not planning on moving soon. Ask me anything.

Tl;dr: German guy lives in San Francisco and likes it a lot. American redditors complain about the U.S a lot and I wanted to give a bit of a counterpoint to that view. AMA

AMA",120,28,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/1hh4pf/im_not_an_arizona_hotshot_but_was_a_blm/,"*(It's been quite a few years, so it's hard to find proof. Because of that, I've removed the post from IAMA, which requires proof. I have some pay stubs somewhere, and an article clipping, and some hospital bills, but we recently moved and I have no idea what box they're in. I realize this is a smaller audience than IAMA, but it might take days to find the proof and there's interest **now** so AMA it is!)*


First: Deep sadness and respect to the 19 Hotshot firefighters who died in Arizona yesterday, and those who have sacrificed themselves and watched friends perish in this line of work.


I worked for the BLM, Idaho Falls district, in the summer of '85. My first job out of high school. I and my crew were on the Bear Lake fire on August 10 when a clueless supervisor climbed into the cab and ordered the driver through a wall of flame, just to get to another sector. There were four of us on the exposed back of the fire truck. We drove into the flame, but didn't drive out. This is that story.


First, a tie-in to the Arizona news. [This is a short video](http://www.cnn.com/video/?/video/us/2013/07/01/newday-petersons-fire-shelter-explainer.cnn) explaining (roughly) how the fire shelters work. When we trained on them, we were told to seal the edges as much as possible to prevent any smoke from getting in (by piling dirt on the inside edges). What the video doesn't show are straps at each corner--you're supposed to hold the shelter down by placing your feet and hands on those straps, so you don't touch the walls of the shelter. They also told us to not remove the shelter until a rescuer comes by and taps your shelter as an ""all clear"" signal. But, it's a last-ditch thing, and the pup tent-like thing can do only so much.


To deploy the tent, while standing, you take the shelter out of its fanny pack, unfold it, fluff it open, put your feet and hands on the straps, then you're supposed to fall forward onto the ground, in effect ""inflating"" the tent further on your way down. One potential problem with these is that the metallic covering can wear out if the pack has been worn a lot. The shelter itself is stored in a thick, sealed, vinyl envelope that can be opened quickly with a tear tab. But, the tent inside can be rubbed thin if the pack is worn too much. And you don't know how worn it is until it's opened.


In my crew's accident, we simply didn't have time to deploy the shelters. And, with the tanker lurching, we had no idea whether it would be safest on the truck or down in the flames. As it was, the flames found us. A sector boss had climbed into the cab and ordered the driver to take us through a wall of flame, not as an emergency, but just to get us to our fire sector. We turned the nozzles on ""fog"" as we'd been trained, pointed them at each other, and off we went before even having a chance to get all our gear cinched down. It wasn't until we were well into the flame that we realized (1) the water wasn't doing squat to keep us cool, (2) the flames that were over our heads, blotting out the sky and everything around us except the truck, were quite warm, (3) the stories of fire robbing oxygen out of the air were true. Inside the flames, the truck stalled because the engine couldn't breathe. Coincidentally, the water pump also stalled. We had nowhere to go, so we just screamed. And screamed. Finally the heat got too much and we just collapsed in a heap. The driver later told me that when he heard our screams stop, he thought that was our end.
There's a lot more to the story. But the short version of the rest: we all lived. Because of my facial/head burns, I did rehab for a month floating in a bacta tank twice a day, singing ""Edelweiss"" through the snorkel to keep my mind off my fear of drowning and the fact that I was submerged for 1/2 hour at a time.


Then, the debridement. My gosh, the debridement...

**Edit:** Questions from the IAMA that I had to delete because I didn't have proof:

**Q**: What's a debridement? **A**: Debridement is when a rehab nurse holds you down and uses a scrubbie to scrape across all of your burns to remove dead tissue. It prevents scarring. It apparently works, because I'm still beautiful. It's also extremely painful, like getting burned all over again.

**Q**: Asking about arson and whether I had to deal with any of that. **A**: No, all of the wildfires I was on were caused by lightning. Fireworks is also a common cause around July timeframe.

**Edit:** I'm not using my crew's full names because, although I stay a *little* in touch with a couple of them still on FB, they don't know I'm doing this AMA and I don't have their permission. But I did want to mention an interesting tidbit: our active crews consisted of 5 men at any given time, while two standby crew were on their days off rotation. On this day's rotation, we happened to have 3 Mikes and 2 Daves. Day-to-day work got confusing right away at the start of the season, so we began going by last names.

**Edit:** While we're memorializing the firefighting dead, maybe now's a good time for a hats-off to two of the men I'd worked with. George Trenkle(?) (not sure I remember the spelling right) was the fire boss (in charge of the whole thing) on the Bear Lake fire. He lost his life a couple of years later trying to save a drowning child. And Del Stewart, our crew boss, home for weekend rotation on the day of this fire. He lost his life the next year when his fire truck rolled. Del loved heavy metal. And George got supremely ticked off at our crew one time when we missed a fire call due to a flat. Life happens. And sometimes it doesn't.",,False,,t5_2r4eo,1372781349.0,,,True,t3_1hh4pf,http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/1hh4pf/im_not_an_arizona_hotshot_but_was_a_blm/,

No idea if anybody would be interested in this, and I can't prove it; but, I just had an attack last night for the first time in several months, so it prompted me to do this, and maybe you guys will have some questions (:


##**Background!**

I started experiencing sleep paralysis back in 2006. At first it would happen every night, or several times a day (I was napping a lot at the time). Then it slowed down to 2-4 times a week. Nowadays, I smoke marijuana to help me sleep undisturbed through the night, but as I said, I had an attack last night after not smoking for a few days. I'm a 24 year old male, if that matters.

I haven't seen a sleep specialist about this, for a couple of reasons:

* I can't reliably predict when it will happen to me.
* I haven't had insurance until very recently.
* I find smoking weed to be a solution, which I am more comfortable with than taking pills or some other manufactured substance.",,False,,t5_2r4eo,False,,,True,t3_18bvo5,http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/18bvo5/i_have_sleep_paralysis_ask_me_anything_about_the/,

1341541199.0,86,self.AMA,w3x8j,IamA person with hardcore synesthesia that affects me heavily every day (and also an incredibly good memory and a lot of stories).  Ask me anything! (xpost from AskReddit after the request),119,33,148,http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/w3x8j/iama_person_with_hardcore_synesthesia_that/,"Lurker on a throwaway here (I don't want to see this on [1] /r/KarmaConspiracy).

I found out yesterday through talking to my psychologist that I appear to have synesthesia. Those unfamiliar with it can do a little bit of reading on the wiki: [2] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synesthesia

For the layman, people with synesthesia are basically tripping balls all the time. Since I was young, I've been a total oddball. I come up with weird, fanciful universes and populate them. My favorite games, for this reason, are Spore and SimCity (and of course old-school sierra games like Kings Quest and Peppers Adventures). At first I just figured I was just imaginative. I write a lot. I have a few close friends but nothing fancy. Everyone knows me for what they call my ""monster memory"".

I love psychology and have done a lot of reading in the field, including on synesthesia. I always figured it was just tasting colors and hearing strange sounds while listening to music. Of course it didn't apply to me.

But then I started connecting dots. Since I was 4, learning to count and write, I have always given the numbers 1-10 individual, separate personalities. 1-10 are like people. Like my friends. Some of them are cruel, but most of them are kind and polite, at least, when we're ""hanging out"" (what I mean here is doing things like math homework or a game that requires basic arithmetic).

As a result, me and math don't really get along. We have a shaky relationship that can maybe be fanned again by the right approach. Foreplay, kind of. Then maybe we'll spend more time together. I'm willing to approach this some other time.

Another byproduct is that I absorb everything. I've seen thousands of movies, listened to thousands of albums, watched thousands of episodes of a ton of TV shows, probably everything you could ever list. I have facts and details memorized and lying dormant for later on.

* I am vicious during trivia night.

* I have never thought about doing something like Jeopardy, even though I'm banned from playing in my family.

* I drive +10-+15 over the speed limit at all times but have only been pulled over 1 time in 6 years for improperly using my turn signal. I attribute this to the synesthesia.

* I can tell you with precision where I was, who I was talking to, and what interests I held on any given day in my past. I challenge you to test this.

* I can memorize lists of 50+ items from 3-5 people and recite them back in perfect order every time.

* I can list dates of various historical events seemingly at random, and usually facts about each event as well.

* I am really, really good with voices/accents/impressions. I once lived as an australian college kid for six months. I convinced a guy at an apple store I was a gypsy from latvia and he ended up giving me a free ipod touch. I can sound both male and female.

* I have a very good singing voice and good pitch now ruined by years of smoking. I still make music (every night for at least an hour) but I rap instead of sing. My lyrics are usually about science, pop culture, history, or Charlie Day from It's Always Sunny.

* I love rap, electronic, metal, bluegrass, blues, jazz, classical, composers (music and movie and video game soundtracks are my favorite), some country music, and oldies. My primary musical outlet, however, is dubstep. Fortunately there's plenty of it and no one really gives me shit. Before you ask, no, I'm not a fan of skrillex (though his sampling is pretty legitimately impressive).

* I work from home and make about 75k a year combined income with one other person. We have one dog and one cat, though I want one more of each. Space doesn't permit it.

* I have nearly unlimited free time.

I have 8 tattoos. They represent something related to each of the following:

*Egyptian history * Children's literature (Lemony Snicket) * Banksy * Vesuvius * Heath Ledger * Rorschach * Ayn Rand * V For Vendetta

* I have not maintained a normal hairstyle in 22 years, which is also my age.

* I have had 22 piercings. The number is a coincidence.

* I have what I believe to be an infinite memory inward and no one to tell.

Talk to me, reddit! What should I do with all of this information?

I have exhausted most treatment options and have had 4 surgeries since my diagnosis in 2006...AMA,101,17,45,http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/1g49ti/i_have_had_endometriosis_for_14_years_and_i_am_28/,"When I was 14, I developed pain so debilitating that a few days a month my mom would call me in sick to school. My doctor told me that ""all girls go through this"" and I believed him. 

Fast forward to 21 where instead of a few days every month the pain had increased to daily. I spent countless visits to the college health centre, had multiple ultrasounds and even had a Dr. ask me if there might be a reason that I was making it all up. eventually she referred me to a specialist who diagnosed me within 5 minutes and set me up for surgery. After 6 months of insane pain I was up for surgery (wait list). 

Sept. 2006 I had my first surgery and I felt great (after the recovery), I obtained new employment and thought I was cured. Within 6 months the pain returned and I was clueless about why (thought I was cured...there is no cure). So I begged my surgeon for her magical touch ..she insisted on my trying Lupron...well $600 a month for medically induced menopause was not fun. After a while, however; I ran out of insurance and had to quit....then in 2008 I had another Surgery. Yay, I was fixed again and ready to live my life!! ...

about 6 months later it came back and I sunk into a deep depression. ..my partner tried to help me but how do you help someone who can't move from pain and is so depressed about it?  Well, anyway, the day of the Japanese Tsunami I had my 3rd surgery (during post secondary mid terms) but it wasn't the relief that I had, had before. I continued to struggle with daily pain and relied heavily on my narcotic to cope.

I endured ridicule, scorn and accusations for being addicted by my peers but I pressed on trying to get better. Eventually I exhausted ALL treatment options and in 2011 my pain was so bad that I stopped eating and my weight plummeted. We tried natural ways and my partner put me on the ""Anti-inflammatory diet"" and the ""Endo Diet"". This helped a lot but is still did not solve my issue with being unable to digest food without a lot of pain. In April of 2011 I went to hospital and fortunately I had a doctor who listened to me. After a CT scan we saw that my appendix was overgrown with Endo to my bowel. I insisted on being sent to another specialist because I knew from experience that Endo (for me) never shows up in the scans...I was sent to a doctor who does Endo ultrasounds. She found that Endo had also wrapped its way around my bowel and tied it up like a parcel...SCARY!

I had my fourth surgery in Dec. 2011 and found some relief but by then the Endo had left fibers on my nerves and some endo had to be left on my nerves (PAINFUL). So for now, my endo is under control...minus the monthly issue but still better. I have Nerve pain and am now on Lyrica.  Without it I would be in bed, hopped up on Painkillers....and for those who judged me...when the pain stopped being constant and debilitating...I quit them and now they sit in a bottle for my monthly issue...

Note: Each surgery they diagnose you with a Stage (4 is the worst). First three surgeries were stage 3 and the fourth one was stage 2 but because it was on my nerves  and bowel it was the worst.

I help run a support group and have seen a lot. The Canadian health care system is not Endo friendly, however; I thank god every day that I don't live in the US because I would be broke and unable to work. If I lived in the US, I would not have been able to afford the treatments (insurance from school) or surgeries...

I intend to hike until I don't want to any more.

Meanwhile, I've acquired some experience and learned some new things about gear, and have gone 2 weeks between resupply once, hopefully to stretch that out to a solid month.  When I was planning this hike, nobody talked about going 2 weeks or longer without an air-drop or something silly.  I'm sure people do it.  I do, and it's easy.

Anyway, ask me anything about hiking and camping that you think I might have a good perspective on...

Today was my last day of work. My bosses gave me two hundred dollars and sent me to a ""massage parlor."" It ended up being an apartment, but I still got a massage, so there's that...

In reference to my original post, I am no longer a virgin. AMA

**EDIT:** Okay, I don't know why I could get away with not giving details. Because of the unsavory nature of the business in which I dealt, I was given turn-by-turn directions on where to go. As in, ""Okay, you go to this intersection."" Once there I called and was given the final destination. I don't even have to knock as she is already waiting at the door, wearing just a bra and some frilly panties. I get led into a bedroom where I strip down naked. The first ten minutes is basically a normal massage. Then without saying anything she takes off what little clothes she has on and proceeds to kiss me up and down the sides of my body, from my torso to my legs and back up again the other side (I'm still face down at this point). 

She tells me to flip over and she does the same thing to my front. After this she put a condom on my dick and started to suck it. Honestly, **blowjobs with a condom on are fucking awful.** I couldn't get off if I wanted to, and it was the first time I was getting one. After she seems, I dunno, satisfied?, she gets under me and ""*lets me in.*"" So it was missionary. I don't know if it was the condom, the situation, me, or the girl, but I **really** had to work to get off. That being said, I'm glad that I know I don't PME in the real deal. After I finish, she gives me another massage. She finishes up and lets me take a shower. I get dressed and we say our goodbyes.

Honestly, I walked out of that building *glowing*. I was/am so happy that I finally got it over with, sex and all. It really isn't that big of a deal, especially if it's not with someone that you care for.

I don't regret losing it to what was essentially a hooker. I'm glad I got it out of the way.

I have taken just about any medicine in the book, and am currently medicine free, and half-way functioning. I have a lot of anxiety and depression as a result of maltreatment.

So: shoot. Ask me anything

Oh, and I am not an American. (In case that makes a difference to someone)

Edit: Appears I mis-spelled Schizophrenic. I am not a native ENglish speaker and so I made a mistake. Sorry about that. I don't know how to fix the title thou, so I am going to have to leave it for now. Sorry

Edit#2: I have a therapy session in 10 hours so I have to get to bed now, but keep posting questions if you want to and I will answer them tomorrow when I get home=) Thank you all for being so nice=)

I actually started to feel a bit off while we were visiting Machu Picchu, Ha. So basically I just kinda started getting normal Flu like symptoms, Slight Fever, Headaches, Cold Sweats and such. But I also had this painful lump in my groin that I didn't really think much of at the time.

Then after waking up again feeling worse I had a look through the disease section of my guidebook and I read the bit on the Plague just out of interest, not because I thought I had it (I actually didn't know it still existed). Then I realized I had all of the symptoms exactly, specifically the big one which is a painful, swollen lymph node in the groin. At this point I started freaking out. My girlfriend was out exploring so I got on the internet and did some research. This freaked me out way more. Turns out it is extremely rare (5 cases in Peru a year) and has a 50% survival rate if treated!! and a lot less if not.

So after what felt like ages my girlfriend came back and after convincing her that I probably had the Bubonic Plague, (she laughed a lot at first) we decided to got to the hospital. Neither of us spoke Spanish very well so it was a bit of a struggle to convey what we thought was wrong but after a while the doctor figured it out (the story is less exciting from here) He kind of nodded and said ""Si, La Plaga"" and gave me some antibiotics. So in the end the actual Plague itself wasn't so bad. The antibiotics on the other hand destroyed me for about three weeks. So its not the most interesting story but its pretty cool to be able to say I've had the Bubonic Plague!

Some months back, I wrote a number of stories about my experiences teaching high school, and Reddit encouraged me to write a book.  So I did.  ~~For the rest of Today (July 8th), the Kindle e-book is available for free on Amazon.~~  The free promotion has ended.  I am currently in communication with Amazon, working on getting them to drop the price down to 99 cents!  Stay tuned.  [Click here to get your copy!](http://www.amazon.com/Schooled-ebook/dp/B007TPZ7XO)  If you read it, please consider writing an Amazon review so others will know whether to invest their time.  And spread the word so others can get it for free, as the free promotion ends later this evening (midnight, PST, approximately).

Just what the title says. I am (that is, I self-identify as) a furry. Feel free to ask me anything. The [original request]( http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/13jbdr/ama_request_a_furry_or_somebody_with_any_other/ ) seemed to have a particular focus on the sexual implications; I am open to these types of questions.

I will be answering questions during at least these periods *today* (all times GMT - 8):

* 9-10 AM
* 2-4 PM
* 8-9 PM

I have a smartphone with the Reddit app, so I will attempt to answer questions throughout the day, but the above are the times I have set aside.

Further, I will attempt to answer all questions posed; if your question has not been answered at the end of the day, rest assured I'll probably get to it tomorrow.

Regarding verification: due to the self-identifying nature of the classification, I imagine it would be very difficult to prove that I am a furry. If you have any suggestions, I'm open to them, but otherwise, I suppose you'll just have to judge for yourself.

Have at it!

Silly 1880, I hope you haven't been deleting my pointless ama's.  Part of the point of this subreddit (besides redirecting people to /r/iama) is a place to post ama's you don't feel belong in /r/iama, why would we delete those?  And stupid requests?  Well, they are stupid since celebrities don't go in a subreddit with 10,000 people, but that might change soon, depending on whether this subreddit becomes the official replacement of /r/iama.  

If so we're going to have to create a verification system, and have new moderators.  Moderators won't be people who are necessarily the ""reddit elite"", but be people we trust would be good at it.  Interested?  Leave a comment.

About downvotes: I might change that rule.  I do think that the upvote/downvote system isn't good and contributes to opinions that disagree with the majority to be effectively censored via the downvote system, which most people don't seem to use responsibly.  I think the admins can do better.  I'm willing to reverse that (at least temporarily), depending on your input.

I also lived in Kuwait for almost six years until my family’s mandatory evacuation, and then attended an all-girls Catholic school for nine years. AMA. ",108,37,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/1ax3h3/i_am_the_daughter_of_a_cambodian_civil_war/,"My life (and pre-life) story is pretty complicated. People often ask me where I’m from or what ethnicity I am, but I never give a straight-forward answer without being asked a million questions afterwards. So I’ve decided to share my story—so ask me anything!


**Pre-Me:**

My maternal grandparents lived in China, but for reasons unbeknownst to me (I’ve never really asked my grandmother why), they moved to Cambodia before any of their children were born. They had five kids—two girls and three boys, born in that order. When my mom was thirteen, the Khmer Rouge (a communist party) took over and thus began the Cambodian Genocide. This party tried to create their own idea of “social reform” which exactly led to social ruin, which has kept the country in shambles to this day. Luckily, my mother’s immediate family and some members of her extended family had the opportunity to escape to the U.S. before things got ugly. Unfortunately, they didn’t have much time to prepare, and had to leave almost all their belongings behind. My grandfather came to the United States with only $100 in his pocket. The family lived at a refugee camp in San Francisco for a few months before being transferred to Houston, Texas, where they were sponsored by an extremely generous family. To this day, my mother is extremely close with her host mom. As neither of her parents spoke English, my mother became both the translator and the guardian for her family. At the young age of 13, she had no other choice but to step up and become the leader and breadwinner of the family. 

My father was born in a very poor village in Tunisia, the twelfth of thirteen children. He doesn’t talk much about his life from his youth, but I know his parents worked very, very hard to try to make ends meet with thirteen mouths to feed. My dad worked incredibly hard in school and it paid off–after a year or two at the local university, he moved to Galveston, Texas to live with his eldest brother, who was the first person in his family to leave Tunisia. Soon, my father enrolled at the University of Houston, where he met my mother. The story of how they met is creepily cute. I’ll tell if someone asks. 

**Me:**

I am the third of four children and the only girl in my family. The first three of us were born in Houston. When I was four years old, my father was given a job offer overseas in Kuwait (he worked for Texaco, which turned into Chevrontexaco and is now just Chevron), which he gladly accepted. My two older brothers and I attended the American School of Kuwait until we left when I was in third grade. My youngest (and last) brother was born in Kuwait maybe a year after we moved there, but was still a baby when we had to leave. To be honest, I’m not very knowledgeable about the situation I was in, since I was only a kid when everything happened. I was pretty oblivious to what was going on in the world (For example: I don’t remember ever hearing anything about 9/11 when it happened). This is what I understood as a kid: the States and Kuwait were all buddy-buddy/friends, and Iraq hated the United States, so they threatened to bomb/invade Kuwait to upset the Americans. The threat had been around for a while, but it had only been a rumor until I was in third grade. Once the threats became more real, my family was given notice that we had to leave. We lived in a mostly-American housing compound, and our neighborhood likely would’ve been targeted. So in February of 2003 (nine years old), I found myself back at “home” (Houston), but it didn’t feel quite right. It took a few years for the weird feeling to fade away. My parents didn’t return to Kuwait to get our stuff until May 2004. 

Fast-forward about nine years: I’ve graduated from the school I spent nine years at (an all-girls Catholic school – the same one my mother attended when she came to Houston), and am now a freshman at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York.

Wondering what a half-Chinese, half-Tunisian looks like? [Pic here.](http://imgur.com/SPDoOVV) I’ve been mistaken for Mexican, half-black/half-white, and my favorite: half-black/half-Mexican (or what my best friend endearingly calls “Blaxican”).

Dear So and So,
Most of my Mary Kay customers are family and/or friends and I have truly appreciated your support in my business venture. I just don't feel right taking your money for a product and company that I've found isn't right for me anymore. While I don't want to bash Mary Kay, after all, they stress the importance of being positive, I've found the truth is that MK is a pyramid company. There is no possible way to make money unless I were to recruit all of my family and friends and pressure you into purchasing thousands of dollars in inventory. Great for me, not so great for you. Your incredible support just reinforces what I believe - that I have the best family in the world.

What I sent to the people I love and who were supportive even though they knew I was being rediculous:

Dear Family and Friends,
I'm sending this letter to you because I just accepted what most of you already knew - Mary Kay is a blood sucking, life draining, resource abusing, money hungry, pyramid company. I can't believe I fell for the cult-like hype of positive thinking and put my common sense on hold for a while. It just seemed so real and I loved the thought of what I might be able to earn to better my life. Unfortunately, all those women who spoke so highly of what could be were it up to me, were themselves JUST FAKING IT. I was cleverly and masterfully manipulated into spending thousands of dollars on inventory, almost indoctrinated into putting Mary Kay above my family and faith, and probably have run off several family and friends with my misplaced focus. 
All that has changed now. I see the truth of the company, that NO ONE makes the money they claim to, that they do fuzzy bookkeeping, and when legitimate questions are raised are summarily shun the offending woman who dares use her brain.
I'm out of it now! 
Sincerely,

AMA (x-post)",89,26,72,http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/10394c/i_went_to_job_corps_and_it_was_the_scariest_time/,"I went to Sierra Nevada Job Corps outside Reno, NV in 2005/2006, Graduated with 4 trades in less then 6 months. Medical Transcription, Medical Records, Medical Reception, and Medical Codes.  I left to go home on Feb 15th because of the craziness of the place even thought I could have and should have completed more. It was the worst experience of my life, also one of the most dangerous and scariest.

There was so much harassment, knives, guns, gangs, rape, attacks, and more I have tons of stories to share. 

Girls and Boys had separate dorms on separate parts of the campus and were not allowed into each others dormitories without an RA and only allowed in the common area/RA office. There was a campus wide curfew of 8pm. Lights out by 9pm. Bed checks and more. Every morning you had to be out of your dorm prior to 7am.

Your first week was spent getting to know your incoming classmates and learning what trade you wanted to do, Your second and third week was spent doing dirty work.. I.e cleaning dishes, picking up trays, picking up trash around the campus, things of this sort. Your 4th week was spent getting you ready for your trade, setting up your outfits and establishing letting you sit in on the classes to make sure that was the trade you wanted. Once in the class you would have to complete the class to switch out. 

Ages ranged from 16-22. Most of the 16-18 year old were people from Juvi who were given a choice of juvenile detention or going to job corps. 

Living there was one of the most challenging things of my life. The reason why was all the drama.. If someone said you did something, a mob of people would come beat the shit out of you even if it wasn't you. One more then 1 occasion there was an ambulance at our site taking away kids to the ER.

Ask me anything! Crazy stories, Life on campus, whatever you can think of pop it off!

Once I get back home in October I can upload Farewell messages from fellow Job Corps people- However For now all I have is this picture of me and some fellow [job corps people](http://i.imgur.com/3xeye.jpg) that I was close too. If anyone recognized them let them know and have them jump on Reddit lol! 

Edit: Thank you everyone for the questions, if you have any more I will be happy to answer anything and everything.  

I wanted to say that while my experience was singularly horrible, with very little good experiences, others have posted that theirs was okay. Job Corps as a whole is a good idea, although their trade programs should be revamped to include more hands on training and opportunities all the programs and what you learn vary based on sites(at least for Sierra Nevada). If You can find a decent Job Corps (some recommended Philadelphia, Astoria Oregon, Cascades Job Corps in Washington State, and Ronan Montana) and dedicate your time to learning while in classes you should do fine. Just remember to watch who you make friends with because there are cliques and some places do have bad kids within the center. Overall the program is good, its the experiences from other students that made my experience horrible.

My mom is an agnostic and my dad is a deist. Since I didn't grow up in a family that thought much of the church, I never had any knowledge of Christ until later into my childhood.
As I grew up and started developing my own opinions on things, I became fascinated with science, especially things dealing with the stars and space. Through what I knew and had researched, I became convinced that Christianity was an elaborate falsehood fabricated by man in order to cope with the fact that when we die we rot for all eternity. I would sit around the dinner table with my dad and grandparents, slamming Christianity with them as we ate our delicious homecooked meals. I believed there was no god, and that the religions of the world were essentially the biggest lies ever told.

My sophomore year in high school, I had an experience with God. I accepted Christ (there is much more to that experience than that) and have never looked back. Ask me anything, there is a lot to tell.

AMA,83,27,100,http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/1b1iov/iama_hr_manager_responsible_for_hiring_and_firing/,"I've worked in HR in both large and small businesses, and I am currently the HR Manager &amp; Director of Operations at a small manufacturing business.  I did an AMA a couple years ago and recently I received a couple requests to do another one.  

Here are my top three tips for job seeking: 

1) Hiring is an inherently unfair process.  Sometimes I might receive a thousand resumes for a single position, and there's no way I can go through them all to find the absolute best person to hire.  While every company's HR department is different, most of them are going to be subject to similar time constraints in both the resume search and interviewing.  Sometimes the best thing you can do to succeed is to not disqualify yourself.  For example, proofread your resume several times and then get someone else to do it too.  I'd say 2/3 of the resumes I receive have at least one spelling or major grammatical error.  This can be enough to disqualify a person for many jobs, such as a marketing position, and at the least shows inattention to detail.  Also remember, every HR department/person might be looking for something different... you have to play the best odds.

2) Study for your interview like you would a test.  I've never understood why people will study for hours and hours the night before a school exam, but will show up to an interview knowing next to nothing about the company or the position offered, or won't bring their portfolio or a copy of their resume to the interview.  A job interview is far more important to your life than some freshman psychology midterm.

3) Use the top of your resume to catch your interviewer's interest.  A boring objective statement is a waste of space.  Don't write ""Objective: To use my x skills and education to help a company blah blah blah""  or ""To find a position in x where I can utilize my x skills."" Instead, make it memorable and powerful.  Maybe something like ""I am one of the smartest/most qualified/most creative individuals you will ever meet, and I can prove it to you in a 15 minute interview.""  Or alternately, ""I am confident that my design/financial/writing skills/hard work will add value to your company from day one.""  Remember, 90% of the battle to find a job is just getting the interview.",,False,,t5_2r4eo,False,,,True,t3_1b1iov,http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/1b1iov/iama_hr_manager_responsible_for_hiring_and_firing/,

1338852809.0,55,self.AMA,ul3jm,I have done bathsalts at least a half dozen times and don't think this cannibalism/violence has anything to do with bathsalts. AMA,117,62,73,http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/ul3jm/i_have_done_bathsalts_at_least_a_half_dozen_times/,"Ok, I have done bathsats about a half dozen or maybe a dozen times, and won't do it again although I had a great time and don't regret it. Everything in moderation, a friend I randomly ran into offered me some and I really enjoyed it so got my own, twice.

Bathsalts is what they are sold as, but really it is synthetic MDMA/COKE with its own little kick to feel like you are rolling. It is supposed to simulate a feeling of a mix of extacy and coke, and you snort it just like you you snort rolls or lines.

Its like 15 or twenty dollars for a little plastic thing that has enough to get like 4 people really fucked up for a night and have a great time. 

It was great, but I would just be chasing the dragon as my tolerances gets higher, I had enough. Its a good time though, no regrets. I seem totally fine, and already did by the next morning each time.  **Bathsalts are bathsalts like Salvia is ~~intense~~ incense though**, as in not at all. It clearly says ""NOT FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION, CONTACT A DOCTOR IMMEDIATELY IF INGESTED"" on it a few times, but it obviously is meant for human consumption and they are covering their ass. 

What we are seeing here with this obscene violence just does not seem like bathsalts *at all*, and seems exactly like normal and typcial PCP horror stories. I knew of this dude that ate his motherthicking fingers on PCP, that shit happens. Bathsalts are chill for the most part, the upper part isn't any more than coke or rolling. This makes me think it just can't be bathsalts. Someone maybe just wants to make them illegal and are doing it in an underhanded way and blaming PCP overdoses on it.

Really though, I think they just wanted everyone talking about this and not the bilderberg conference over the weekend. They have machinegun turrets and unprecedented measures for security this year, they are getting afraid, probably because do the internet people actually know what those inbred hoarders are up to now. They don't want people even thinking about the Blderberg group, so staged a zombie apocalypse out of the usual PCP overdose horror stories so we are here talking about this instead of about those that farm us like animals. And it worked perfectly.

Is there any way I can even prove this?? I could PM the mods with the store I got them at, I don't want to go telling the whole world though. It seems kind of a hushhush word-of-mouth-only-to-freinds kind of a thing.

Edit: sorry for the radio silence guys. I fell asleep for a while there. I'm back now and ready to answer anything!

Edit 2: I wrote a guide on how I made them. I'll post it here too.

 Alright then. Here it goes.

When making a headvoice, also called thought forms or tulpas, there is a certain way to go around it. There are many guides on the internet about it that I took ideas from but made them my own. This is a unique way of making them I don't think you'll find anywhere else.

First thing you have to do is plan what you want them to be. Write down basic personality, start sketching how they will look, get a feel for the character. Start to brainstorm names for them. It is very important you know the name at all times during the creation process. If you know the true name of your creation you can at any time bend them to your will. I didn't know Drew's true name and look at the trouble that gave me. 

Next, make sure you're alone. It takes several hours to form your headvoice and any interruptions can be disastrous. They could destroy or twist your creation into something you don't want in your head.

Now comes the creating. Be sure you are comfortable and it's dark. Lying down often helps but is not necessary. Imagine how your thoughtform will look in your minds eye. Go over it and make sure it's perfect. When it is, begin to form the personality.

Just ask questions to your thoughtform and force the answers. Pretend you're having a conversation with it. Ask questions that the answers will help reflect the personality such as ""What would you do if a child was trapped in a burning building? "" and force an answer that would mean the thoughtform would save it.

As you go on, the answers will become less forced and more natural. You can still force answers if the form hasn't conformed to your assigned personality. You know you're done when the voice changes. It can happen gradually or be quite sudden. Drew for example all of a sudden sounded like Stephen Hawking. Viekror got his strong accent suddenly too. Thoughery gradually went from my inner voice to the voice of a guy at my school.

After their voice changes discuss names. While they are newly formed you can still dispel them if they refuse to cooperate. Once you have their name, ask how it's spelled. Never forget this and write it down somewhere. With this name you can take them over at any time, stop then from rebelling.

When I was living in Japan I had to travel to Okinawa for a business trip for a month. While there I stayed in a company apartment with a guy named Tim. As exciting as Okinawa sounds, there really isn't much to do around the cities. They are old, dirty, and have tons of military (which to me is not a bad thing, but the Japanese don't care for it.)

Being bored one day, my roommate Tim and I decided to go snorkeling. He knew of a great secluded spot about an hour from where we were staying. 

We packed up the car and grabbed out wetsuits and headed out. When we got there I understood by what he meant by ""secluded."" We hadn't passed anyone coming in or out of the park, and when we stopped at the water there was no one to be seen. 

The area we decided to go was at the bottom of 100 foot cliffs that went on for miles in both directions. Looking down over the edge gave me vertigo, and never being good with heights I started getting a bad feeling about this trip already. 

The only access to the water was through these very old steps that had been carved into the rock front. Scaling down was tricky, especially with no shoes on. At the bottom of the stairs was a small rock ledge about a foot wide 3 or 4 feet about the water. You could stand on the ledge, and move side to side, but it was difficult and treacherous. These were sharp rocks. We lowered ourselves into the water. 

We got into the water finally and started swimming around. I was in the water for about fifteen minutes when I noticed the water was getting choppier and the current stronger. I decided I had enough and started swimming back to the rock ledge. The current was being a real bitch, and I used up a lot of energy just getting back to the rock wall. 

Tim decided he wanted to stay in the water for awhile longer, so I pulled myself up onto the ledge. Now, this is something I didn't see and don't remember, but Tim saw it. 

Tim was watching me from the water pulling myself up. I was standing with my back to the water catching my breath when a wave taller than me (I am about 5 foot 8) covered me and slammed me into the wall. So that is a about 4 feet from the water, about 6 feet for me, and then add on another 3 or 4 feet taller than me (as reported by Tim) wave, so about a 14 or 15 foot wave hit me and hit me hard. The wave came out of nowhere and caught me off-guard. I no longer had my vest on or goggles. 

The impact slammed me into the wall, crushing my ribs, right knee, and right arm. I am not sure my head got hit, but I am assuming it did. The next thing Tim knows is that I am gone. I am nowhere to be seen. 

I had no idea what hit me, no idea where I was, no idea if I was upside down or rightside up. All I knew was something bad just happened and I wasn't supposed to be where I was. I swam up, hoping I was going up. I finally hit the surface and breath hard for air. That would be one of the last breaths I would take for awhile. 

As soon as I got a little air another wave hit me and knocked me underwater. I started swimming up again, as soon as I broke the surface and before I could take a breath another wave hit me and down I went. I tried again, as soon as I got up another wave hit me and I went under again. 

At this point I was about 50 yards from the rock wall, pulled there by the current. I knew I didn't have a chance to get back. My knee wouldn't bend, and my arm was in pain, and my ribs felt like serious shit. 

This is when I realized I was about to die. Now, it was a strange feeling knowing that you are about to meet your maker. But the weirdest part was I wasn't scared. I was okay with dying, and I don't know why. The one feeling I had was a little bit of anger though. I didn't even WANT to go to Okinawa for a month for work. I was actually pissed, believe it or not, that I was about to die in a place I didn't even want to be at. 

All of these thoughts passed through my mind in an instant. I thought about my Mom, my girlfriend, and how I would miss my apartment in mainland Japan (strange, right? But it was a really kickass apartment). I get to the surface again, and I remember in that split second before I went under again how beautiful everything looked. The water, the palm trees hanging over the rocks on top, the rocks themselves. But that feeling left quickly as I went under again. 

""This is it, that was the last time."" I remember thinking to myself. No air, no more energy, pain, and no more hope. 

Then, out of nowhere Tim swims, from underwater, and pulls me to the surface. He held my arm as he used his other to stay afloat, I tried my best to help him anyway we could. 

I don't remember the inital exchange, but he was panicked and so was I. 

""We have to get to the rock wall."" He said. 

""I can't, I can't move my fucking leg."" I said back. ""Fuck man, I don't want to die. I don't want to die here."" Strange how when it was about to happen I was okay with it, but the second you get some hope of life back you will do whatever you can to hold onto it and keep it. 

""There! That cave, we need to get to that cave."" Tim said pointing to a cave about 200 yards farther down from where we were and about 50 yards to the wall. ""I've been there before, there is a way to walk out of the cave to the surface.""

""I can't man, that is too far."" I said, choking up water and still trying to get air into my lungs.

""You have to."" He said, and then began swimming. He pulled me along as best he could, and I tried to make up for the rest. We had to dodge rocks sticking out of the water, and try from being sucked back into the current. I used muscles and energy that I never knew I had. 

""Land, you can stand, stand!"" I remember Tim yelling. I put my feet down, and just barely, barely my big toe felt solid land. It was one of the best feelings I have ever felt. We swam a little further until we could actually stand with our heads above water. 

But with the current and the waves standing wasn't an option. We had to wait for a wave, let it push us down, then grab onto the corral while the wave receded, or we would be out in the ocean again. We did this over and over and over again until we were able to stand. We got to the cave and I threw-up water. I walked deeper into the cave and collapsed. Tim started looking around. 

""Shit, this isn't good."" Tim said. ""This isn't the right cave.""

""What?"" I said. 

""I don't know where we are. But I haven't been here before."" Tim said. ""Oh no.""

""What?""

""Your feet."" He said. I looked down at my feet and then realized I was sitting in a pool of blood with a trail of blood coming from the entrance of the cave. I looked down at my feet and noticed almost all the skin and a lot of flesh was missing. From getting across the corral in front of the cave I must've ripped my feet from the sharp edges. 

""We need to get you help."" He said. 

""Yeah, how. I can't move my leg."" I said. 

""I need to go back out.""

""No, man. You are not going back out there."" At this point the waves had gotten stronger, possibly a storm coming in from off the coast.

""We can't stay here, no one is around here."" And with that, Tim swam back out. I sat there, cold and in pain and dehydrated for what seemed like hours. The sun had set and there was no sign of Tim or anyone else. 

I, unfortunately, came to the realization that Tim drowned. He shouldn't have taken so long. And so I thought what I would say to his parents. That their son died saving me? What do you say to someone. No, you can't think like that. He is alive, he is okay. But where the hell was he?

""HELLO!?"" I hear. I wobble over to the entrance to the cave and look up the rock wall. Across the small lagoon on the opposite side from the cave on top of the wall was a small figure shouting at me. He couldn't hear me but he could see me waving my arm for help. 

About ten minutes later two men rappel down the rock wall across the lagoon. The waves have gotten bigger and stronger, and as they walked across the coral, a huge wave smashes into them. I see one of them disappear under the wave, the other one went flying towards the wall. 

""Oh fuck!"" I said. Panicked and worried about the two guys, I sit and wait and hope. Finally they reappear, battered but unbroken. They make it to where I am and sit down panting. Two paramedics. Thank God! 

They tell me they can't take me out of the cave right now because the waves are too strong. So we sit and wait for a couple hours until the waves are slowing down enough to be evac'd. I can't move my leg and my arm is really sore, so they each take an arm and strap me into a harness and walk me slowly across the coral to the opposite rock wall. They then pull me up slowly. 

When I get to the top I ask where Tim is. ""He's okay."" One of them says. I am safely on top when I realize they had called everyone, and I mean everyone. The local paramedics, the Japanese Coast Guard and the American military. I have to admit, I was really embarrassed. But safe.

Tim met with me at the ambulance. The paramedics checked me out and realized nothing was broken, at least not that they could determine. I decided I didn't want to go to the hospital, and would go tomorrow. I didn't want to spend the night there. I wanted a beer and sleep. 

As I sit there in the ambulance, they ask about what happened. I tell them. ""Most likely a small tsunami caused the wave."" One of them said. A couple agreed. A couple others thought it was a storm off the coast, short but sweet and nasty. As they are done cleaning and bandaging my feet, one of them stops and starts counting.

""One, two, three... Ten."" He said. 

""What? Why are you counting?"" I asked. 

""Your feet. You stepped on a sea urchin."" He says. Yup, on top of everything else, I stepped on two sea urchins. I had a total of 20 sea urchin needles sticking straight up into my feet. 

That was the day I almost died and my roommate Tim became a hero.

I was mentioning my project; www.idreamofspace.com to some friends of mine, and they all suggested I should be all over Reddit, given that we're giving people a chance to go to space for $10 and all.

So!

Because the first question is going to be 'is this legit?' you can see what Wired had to say here:
http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2012/05/suborbital-spaceflight-raffle/

Then, if you're so inclined, you can check out the site FAQ here: https://www.idreamofspace.com/faq

Other than that...

AMA!


EDIT: Sir Seromm suggested we put this exchange here:

Q: Do you guys even read the FAQ on their site? It's a raffle with a 1/25,000 chance of winning.

A: Drawing, technically, but yes - the people have a 1 in 25,000 chance of going into space, where to date, a little over 500 humans have been so far. (Which is nothing when you think about the fact we've been able to do it for 50 years...) The exception to this is when people get a bunch of entries which perhaps unsurprisingly, gets them a higher chance.

This was 2000-2001

* 21 (the remake of quiz show with Maury Povich)
* Hollywood Showdown
* Supermarket Sweep (about 110 episodes over the course of 3 months)

Vista also does the electronics and set building for Jeopardy, so I actually helped to construct some of the sets that were used for various College Jeopardy tournaments, and helped put together the podiums and electronics, though I was never allowed to actually Operate on that show as they had a dedicated guy for that one.

Supermarket Sweep was definitely the most fun to work on so I have the best stories from that show:

For instance, we taped 5 episodes a day, and all of the big sweep segments happened after lunch. The camera men had a ritual of going out and smoking copious amounts of pot at lunch before running up and down the isles chasing contestants.

Also, quite frequently laughter would break out on the set and the host and/or contestants would look puzzled (as they were the only ones without headsets listening to the director). The director *relentlessly* made fun of the host, and the contestants throughout the day.

I have been installing appliances since the age of 15, repairing B graded models since the age of 16 which involved diagnosing problems and faults. I currently sell spare parts for the company to customers and trades people alike. 

I have always been shocked by the amount of knowledge customers do not have about their appliances. However this is not always necessarily their fault, but instead the fault of the companies who don't always tell you what are best ways to maintain and care for your appliance to gain the best results and life expectancy for your money. 

I had a look on reddit and there doesn't really seem to be many people helping on this topic so I thought I would throw my hat in the ring and try and help with any questions you may have about your washing machine, dishwasher, fridge/freezer, microwave, extractor hood, oven etc etc! 


I look forward to hearing from you :) 

(P.S, this was intended for U.K appliances but I will try to answer U.S questions also, as I know sometimes our appliances differ compared to yours!)




edit: Wow I had no idea people would get so into this. It's great to see so many people who want the best for their appliances and their wallets/ purses! 

If you require any spare parts and you are from the UK look me up and I will try my best to help.

Basically I have a fully functional third testicle. I thought at first that it might have been a tumor, because due to my upbringing, genital fondling was discouraged greatly. Having reached my late teen years and finally getting out on my own, a lady friend of mine was shocked by what she felt in my crotchal area during a session of intimate groping.

I was shocked to learn that there was something amiss as I had never considered there to be anything wrong in the first place. For a few weeks I assumed I had a tumor and was terrified to touch it until I worked up the courage to go to the doctor.

The doctor initially dismissed it as a swollen epididymis, but then changed his mind upon further inspection. I made sure he groped me good and thoroughly because doctors aren't cheap here in the states. 
An ultrasound revealed a tiny but fully plumbed extra testicle taking up residency on the left side of my internal scrotal knapsac.

He wasn't sure what it was called at first, so he made some calls to more specialized doctors and smart people just to be sure. The phone call I received about a week later was the best one I've ever gotten in my life.

Me. Hello?
Doc. Is so and so there?
Me.Yes
Doc.After making a few dozen phone calls to colleagues and friends, I'd like you to come in the office for a follow up, I have some interesting news to tell you. It seems that you've got a fully functional third testicle, and a medical condition called Polyochidism.
Me.Ok

Anyway, the conversation continued on in a boring manner, and ended with me scheduling an appointment.
When I went back in, my doc had a few guests to see me, mostly colleagues and one specialist. So, to cut down on my rambling, they poked and prodded me and looked at my balls and congratulated me on being unique. That's about it.

I have 3 balls, and I still can't get a date.

Three years ago, when I was 23, I met this girl at a bar in LA while I was staying at a friends house for a couple weeks. Let's just call her ""Crazie"". Actually, fuck that. Fuck her. Her name was Sam and I'll call her that.

Anyway, we got to talking and she seemed like a nice chick. She insited on buying me drinks the whole night even though I'm not to big of a drinker. She had none which I thought was strange considering how much she loved ""having a good time"" and ""the LA night life""

So fast forward a couple hours. I'm at her house and we're having sex. She really wanted to tie me up cause she was weird like that. I gave in and let her tie just my hands to the bed post.

So we're having sex and she pulls off my condom cause she wanted to ""know how it feels for a sec."" I tell her i'm about to cum so I pulled out and shot my load on her belly. Well then this chick says ""No, I want you to be a father"" Something like that, I don't remember.  At that moment she starts beginning to insert my sperm from her belly into her vagina. I fucking lost it! 

I panicked. I couldn't reach her since she had my hands tied so I lifted her with my feet and threw her onto me. We entered this weird 69 looking position and I did the only thing I thought I could do. I licked my own sperm off her stomach to ensure she didn't have any more to put in her vagina. She started reaching for my dick, but I kicked her in the face, pulled my hands free, grabbed my pants, and ran out of her house. I didn't even take time to find my shirt. 

I never talked about what happened that day to anyone. Mainly cause I knew nobody would believe me and I also didn't want to get into legal trouble for kicking her in the face. I know this story is hard to believe but it is 100 % real.

AMA,60,11,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/gq5g8/i_did_what_anyone_would_do_i_took_a_homeless/,"I work at the library on my campus.  Last night when we were closing at 2 am I found a girl hiding, curled up in a cupboard in a study room.  

I kept telling her ""don't worry, it's going to be alright... everything's fine.""  I asked her if she had a place to sleep and she said no, and I asked if there was a friends place I could take her to, and no as well.

So I invited her to stay at my place.  She was pretty reluctant- I think mainly because she was embarrassed.  She's an international student and just such a sweet, gentle girl. I couldn't just leave her be

It's just so fucking sad... she said that her family had run in to ""financial difficulties"" back home.  Her dad, who ran the family business, got a wound on his leg that would not heal and they had to amputate it.  Needless to say, the business collapsed and now she is left to fend for herself

As of now I'm in contact with International Programs on campus and am trying to find a permanent housing situation for her.

Any help or advice sure would be appreciated. Thanks


I won't be around the internet too much today as I figure all of this out, but I'll check back when I can

**EDIT:** I spoke with international programs, and they don't have her name in the system, so I really don't know what to believe when she tells me things about her.  I'm going to tell her that I'm giving her one more chance and that it would be best to be honest.  I don't know if she lied because of cultural issues or what, but I'll find out.  When I asked her when the last time was that she ate, she wouldn't reply.  She looks very frail

The school can not help her if she is not a student, so in that case I will be talking to churches.

I also wanted to add: we always hear about government funded, low-income programs getting cut, and I've always thought ""yeah, that's bad"", but now....  I ache thinking about our country's most desperate inhabitants being told to fuck off and die

**EDIT 2** I had planned on meeting her at the library at 8 last night, and she didn't make the meet-up.  I'm sure it was because I caught her in a lie about her being a student.  I went to the next place that I thought she would be- the other library on campus.  I found her there, told her that she didn't need to feel like she had to avoid me, and I told her to find a church to help her.  I don't think she'll be active in doing that, so I'm going to be talking to some churches and then I'll see her again eventually with some more info.",,False,,t5_2r4eo,True,,,True,t3_gq5g8,http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/gq5g8/i_did_what_anyone_would_do_i_took_a_homeless/,

EDIT2: 
The disease (CRPS)  would have started from anything (was essentially dormant in me)  but in this case it was a kick from a horse that destroyed my right thigh. 

LAST (I think?( EDIT: 
The other conditions are related to the CRPS or hypermobility. Fibromyalgia is caused by hypermobility and CRPS because of the musculoskeletal strain caused by mining oddly. 
Frequent fractures occur due to vitamin D deficiencies because the affected bones are always trying to repair themselves. So Before I quit working, I used to get appx 5-9 fractures or stress fractures per year.

The way I got the job was simply, by walking in. I watched a news program called Vanguard and they were talking about the growth and change happening in the adult entertainment industry. Lucky for me their spotlight company was Kink. When one of the employees on the program mentioned they were always looking for new ways to sell people ""porn"", I knew that was my in. I was an international business/marketing major. So my thought process was, ""If I can sell someone something they can just as easily get for free, I can sell anything."" So I walked in with my resume, asked about an internship and they hired me. After a few months a cameraman quit, and I, having a few years of behind the camera experience from being executive producer of my high school news program, was offered the position.

1296630920.0,45,self.AMA,fdnwu,"I am an (half-Egyptian) American citizen who just got back from Cairo.  I stayed in Nasr City where I witnessed some interesting things, specifically neighborhood militias defending their communities from rioters/looters/thieves.  AMA",52,7,46,http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/fdnwu/i_am_an_halfegyptian_american_citizen_who_just/,"I am doing this at the suggestion of a friend (I feel like reddit users always say this...but honestly, I am).  

Basic summary to provide context for anybody who actually wants to ask a question:

-I arrived on Friday night into Cairo to attend the protests.  It was after the curfew (which I believe was 6PM at the time) and the usually crowded streets of Cairo were devoid of any traffic as I headed home (Nasr City).  

That same night Mubarak made a speech that you all probably watched/read about.  The reaction in my neighborhood was instantaneous, with cries of discontent being heard from all over the streets.  

I woke up the next morning and while eating a late breakfast, the usual call to prayer was interrupted by someone using the speakers to warn us of an incoming wave of rioters/looters.  They advised all young men (I'm 23 and male and stay with my grandmother who is older than Mubarak) to come down to the street with any weapon they can find to protect their cars and their houses from being broken into.  I had an uncle (~60 years old) and his wife and 2 daughters staying with us as well, so I felt obligated to participate.  Thus, I spent the next 2 days working with (but mainly just observing) the neighborhood militia.  

I am clearly very sheltered because this ended up being the craziest experience of my life.  There's a lot to include actually, but I don't really want to type it all out.  So if someone asks a question about something I'll respond accordingly.

I took pictures from my grandmother's balcony, but did not take the camera down with me.  I was already an outsider in the sense that I go to Egypt once a year generally, my Arabic is obviously poor to a native ear &amp; the young men in that neighborhood barely know me...so taking a camera was not going to help bring me closer to them.  So if you want some sort of proof, I can provide some but it's not going to be very good photography.  

I might edit this later and include more details.  Sorry for being disorganized.

Also, I would do a separate AMA for the airport experience but I imagine anybody who fled from Cairo could talk about that.  Just want to note that the airport in Cairo, despite trying to evacuate thousands of foreigners (and a decent amount of Egyptians) was thoroughly fucked.  I spent 12 hours there without access to food and the only reason I made it home to Turkey is because of my American passport.  People on my flight (evacuated to Greece at the last moment) had been sleeping on the floor for 3 days...some only eating a slice of pizza a day (evidently the only place left with food was the pizza place?).  As we departed, we were informed that almost all the employees had quit.  27 employees were trying to evacuate thousands if not 10s of thousands of people.  

Al Jazeera is definitely the way to go for coverage by the way.  I don't think I've ever seen people so sad to not have a TV channel as my friends &amp; family became when we lost access to the channel in Egypt.  They're doing a great job on covering the main events, but peripheral things like young boys fighting to keep their dad's car from being stripped doesn't really make the news.

",60,15,81,http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/14zurc/riama_author_of_brain_on_fire_a_memoir_about_my/,"Hi Reddit,
My name is Susannah Cahalan, I'm the author of ""Brain on Fire: My Month of Madness,"" a memoir about how an autoimmune disease caused my own body to attack my brain, robbing me of sanity, memory and identity. The symptoms emerged subtly. At first I thought I had bed bugs; I noticed tingling in my hands; and I became irrationally jealous of my boyfriend's ex. Then I had a seizure, which pushed me further and further into a world of paranoia, violence and hallucinations. I blacked out and ended up in the hospital, where after a month of inconclusive or ""normal"" medical tests of which I have no memory at all, one doctor, whom my mom nicknamed Dr. House, finally conducted an ingenious but simple test which became key to my diagnosis: I had anti-NMDA-receptor autoimmune encephalitis. This is a disease that was only discovered in 2007 (I was treated in 2009) but is believed to have been the cause of ""demonic possessions"" throughout history.  For more back info, check out my web page: http://www.susannahcahalan.com/c/news/

Now that you have the basics, I want to invite you all to ask my anything (within reason, and please remember I'm not a doctor!). Ask me, for example: What do you remember about your hallucinations? How did you write a memoir about an experience you can't remember? What would have happened if he hadn't found the answer? How long did it take for you to recover? How many other people have this disease?

It's only been the past five years (I'm 24) that I've truly been able to appreciate his skill enough to accurately remember stuff he's purchased and sold. So questions like most valuable, most historical, etc., will be easy to answer. If there's shit I can't answer (keep in mind that he's been doing this for thirty years at the least so I am missing a huge chunk of *his* history), I may get him to jump in.

Don't know how interesting this can be, but AMA!

We have 12 beers on tap, we have about 10 wines that we offer, and we offer a full selection of mixed drinks.

I am the taproom manager. I handle the training of staff as well as the hiring and firing, I do a lot of the marketing, I handle the technical aspects.  I have developed most of the distillery processes. I have input in most of the decisions that we have made, and we generally do things by consensus, so I understand the reasoning behind most of the things we have done.

I'm not sure what the interest level will be on this.  I'm a long time lurker (reddit did NOT help me in law school) and I've seen very little discussion of tort reform such as the dreaded McDonald's coffee case of the 90s, but in case somebody here does want to know how the tort system works in the real world, I'll tell you honestly what I think/know/feel about what I seem to have found myself doing for a living.  

Here is my guess at a likely FAQ (I'll probably update this if/when questions are actually asked): 

Q. How many plaintiffs (victims seeking compensation at law) do you think are probably faking?
A. I'd guess around 75% of our clients inflate their treatment to some degree, but this is pretty much just a blind guess by me and I go back and forth about how I think about this question. There is really no way to know for sure.  Also, this would vary from firm to firm based on the client base, and state to state based on the local laws which encourage/discourage tort suits.  Most of our firm's cases are bumper tap cases -- rear end collisions at low speed, and usually there are no objective signs of injury -- just self reported ""soft tissue"" injuries, i.e. ""it hurts 5/10 when I move my arm like this."" It's really up to the client to decide how much medical treatment they decide to receive and my feeling is that many clients are working the system by receiving excess physical therapy, medication, and unnecessary diagnostic tests like x-rays and MRIs. Usually, judges and juries use the cost of medical treatment as a rough guide for determining a Plaintiff's ""pain and suffering,"" which means compensation for non-economic loss, i.e. the amount of money they get from the Defendant.  Again, I have no actual evidence for this, but it seems like common sense . Our firm does handle some serious accidents, which involve ""objective"" injuries like herniated discs, broken bones, traumatic brain injuries, and even wrongful death cases. I've also done some medical malpractice work.  I can get into as much detail as you like if you have specific questions. 

Q. Do you think the system could be fixed to reduce the number of fakers and better help actually injured people? 
A. Yes. I think the system is broken at least in most states. I think tort law should be replaced to a large extent with a no-fault system, like workers' compensation. Although people take advantage of workers compensation as well, the societal cost seems to me to be lower using that type of system. I don't have any stats on that though.  

Q. Wouldn't your proposed system eliminate your job? 
A. Yes. Yes it would. 

Q. Are banjos objectively better than guitars? 
A. Yes.  [See username]

After a morning meeting, I sat down desk to check email when I felt the familiar abdominal pressure that usually precedes a satisfying fart.  ""No problem"", I thought.  ""I'll let this one slide out and my cube-mate will never even know.""

But that is not what happened.

I knew immediately that the situation had gone awry, but my anal reflexes were not quick enough to prevent some of the previously unknown diarrhea from filling the crack of my ass.  I don't know of any other feeling that so suddenly triggers the thought ""wow, my day just got way worse.""

This is one of the handful of occasions when I deeply regret not wearing underwear.  I've been a rough rider since I was a teenager, and it rarely even crosses my mind.  Today, however, it was prominent in my mind as I stood up and felt warm diarrhea start to creep down the backs of my legs.

The march to the restroom was at once purposeful, uncomfortable, and unnatural.  Throwing open the door, I nearly cheered when I saw that the room was empty, and that the glorious handicap stall was mere feet away.

Locking the stall door and ripping my pants down, I was momentarily disturbed by the pile of wet crap in the seat of my pants.  ""I'll take care of that in a minute"", I thought.  ""Right now I have to clear these bowels out to prevent another meltdown.""

I was not prepared for what happened next.  The butt tsunami resembled, in both sound and appearance, a five gallon bucket of Campbell's beef stew being dumped in a the toilet all at once. 

With that unpleasentness behind me, I set about cleaning my pants as well as possible with toilet paper. Still damp, but no chunks remaining.  Time to make my escape.

I'm fortunate to have a job that I can leave with no questions.  I slipped out the back door and began the uncomfortable fifteen minute drive home.

I walked in my house, mumbled a greeting to my wife, and made my way to the bedroom to begin undressing.  She asked why I was home.  ""Shit my pants.  Unexpected explosive diarrha.""  There were no more questions, other than a request to put my pants in the washing machine and start it.

A quick shower washed away the nasty remains of my morning.  A clean pair of black pants made it appear that nothing had happened.

I'm back at work now.  I think it will be a while before I feel comfortable farting again.

tl;dr:  Crapped my pants at work.  Turned out as well as could be expected.

Back in 2007, at the age of 18, I was preparing for the launch of Richard Garriott's (creator of the Ultima series, and Ultima Online) second big hit, named appropriately, ""Richard Garriott's Tabula Rasa"" when I spotted a group of players during the live public beta test who appeared to be competing in a round of fist-i-cuffs.  Being the young opportunist that I was, I inquired to join in the fun.  To my amazement, the person who had organized the small party turned out to be none other than Amy ""Critters"" Crider, the game's own official community manager.  None too familiar with Critters, the group of boxers, or the game at that time, I was un-surprised to learn that their boxing competition was simply an end of beta celebration.  That day however, I found that the game engine had been perfectly tuned to this sort of mechanic, and immediately began plotting a way to make the event more permanent.

After a few short minutes of google searching, I discovered Critters work email for NCSoft, the game's publisher.  Unsure of her response, and expecting silence in return, I sent her a message asking for her company's support in continuing the event past Beta testing.  As you might have imagined, I was again shocked to receive a very enthusiastic and passionate response in support of the event, with promises of official website coverage.  They had been looking for this very sort of community involvement to attract attention to the game.

In my initial email, I believe I had even promised to register a website and forum, but having had expected no response, I hadn't even thought of a name for the event at that time, let alone how I was going to set up a website, in which I had no experience in doing.  Of course, I wasn't about to tell Critters that, and let her down.  So, I quickly launched a crude looking website called, ""TabulaRasaFNF.com"".

**Early video of the event:**

And with that, “Friday Night Fights” was born into the MMO gaming world.    I successfully scheduled and organized the first of many FNF events to come, on the first Friday of the game’s launch.  It attracted dozens of participants from day one, even catching the eye of the game’s top Fansite, PlanetTR.com.  It wasn’t long before I was negotiating a partnership with PlanetTR, and its owner, Scott “aka Deadringer”, and inviting special guests from the Game’s own development team to help host and take part in the weekly event.  It grew and grew until it went from a simple mention on Tabula Rasa’s main website, to a weekly report of its progress.  Shortly after our initial success, we had offers and even threats from major gaming news outlets like IGN.com who threatened to have our new host, PlanetTR.com taken down for using the word, “Planet” in our domain, of which is used often by IGN for their global network of gaming sites, including PlanetAvP.com, Planetbattlefield.com, PlanetHalo.com, PlanetHalfLife.com, etc.   Among the offers was a hosting sponsorship with a company (whose name escapes me currently) that would eventually become GamerDNA.com.

&gt;*Factoid: The small company that offered to sponsor us had an internet radio/podcast DJ on staff named Sam “QforQ” Houston, of whom is now the Community Manager of EA Game’s own publishing platform, Origin.*

My co-host, Deadringer and I continued to operate Friday Night Fight’s without incident for some time until NCSoft was sure we weren’t going away, and we received word from Critters of a surprise from Richard Garriott himself, of whom she mentioned was a huge fan of boxing.    That surprise was to be an in-game instanced boxing ring, including boxing gloves and gear for us to continue hosting Friday Night Fights in a more official capacity.  We would now be able to award a unique item provided by NCSoft itself to our winners each week (either golden boxing gloves, or a large sum of in-game currency).  Before this point, we had been farming items and currency to give to our winners each week.  

**A video of FNF and the boxing ring:**
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=044VUt2WPdY

It was during that time in which NCSoft came to us with a proposal to host a special evening event where Richard Garriott as “Lord British” would face off against real-world, two time world boxing champion, and personal friend of Richard Garriott, Jesús “El Matador” Chávez.  Should Richard Garriott’s character die during this event, it would actually be the second time he has ever been killed in a video game under the name, “Lord British”.  The first of course is on one fateful day in 1997 while addressing players in Ultima Online.

NCSoft continued to support Friday Night Fights every week up until the game’s dying breath after 1 full year, in 2009.  Since then, I have been told of events sharing the same name which continue to prosper in other MMO’s since Tabula Rasa’s, and NCSoft’s closure.  All inspired by a seemingly impossible idea that has long been forgotten to the internet.  

For a short while after the game closed, I even had people recognize and approach me from other online MMO's.  Back then, I was very proud of my accomplishment.  My 15 minutes of fame has since ended, and it is business as usual.

We were both full time DJ's. He came home from a club at around 3:30am, clicked our underground parking gate open and parked his car. As he pulled out his keys to open the door that accessed our building, 2 gang-bangers with guns jumped out from behind a wall and  made him take them up to our apartment, where I was sleeping in nothing but my boxers. 

I barely woke up when I heard my roommate walk into the house, as I could hear the muffled sounds of him quietly talking to someone.

All I saw was a gun in my face and an ominous shadow. I actually thought it was a practical joke my roommate might be playing on me. A bad one! But he was a prankster... so in my sleepy state I said to the guy, ""Man, get the fuck outta here."" 

I then saw my roommate walk by my bedroom door with the second gang-bangers gun in his back and realized it was NO joke. 

For the next 20 minutes they held us hostage while ransacking our apartment, pistol whipped us, made my roommate get naked and tied him up with a phone cord they ripped out of the wall (this is before everyone had cell phones).

AMA.,74,32,49,http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/16e2ft/iaman_ex_fundamentalist_christian_proselytizer_i/,"Hello! Have you ever had a religious person knock on your door and try to convert you to their (Christian) religion/denomination, give you religious pamphlets, or ask if they could take your children with them for several hours a week?


That might have been me.


I am a former member of an Independent Fundamental Baptist (or IFB) church, an unorganized and almost cult-like denomination of fundamentalist protestant churches that share a basic belief system that focuses on the “fundamentals of the faith”, a literal interpretation of the Bible, and public outreach. The IFB movement is mostly prominent in the United States (the movement split from the Southern Baptist Church sometime in the early/mid 20th century due to doctrinal disputes), but there are IFB churches all over the world. There are several different branches of the IFB. The IFB church in which I was involved was very active in what the IFB refers to as “soul-winning”, which is basically door-to-door proselytizing. I was also a member of the church’s missions team, which traveled primarily to various cities and towns in (usually) the eastern United States, but also went on foreign missions trips. Some of the countries the missions team has been to include Mexico, Romania, Peru, Nigeria, Cuba, Kenya, Jamaica, Saint Lucia, and Germany. We also did a lot of “street preaching” and tract distribution in both major cities and small towns.


In addition to this, the church operated a bus ministry. The bus ministry is a branch of the church’s outreach/proselytizing program whose primary purpose is to pick up children in the community and bring them to church in order to convert them. The bus ministry is made up of different teams that are assigned to certain neighborhoods and territories of the city in which the church is located. Each team has its own bus and bus driver. On Saturdays, each team goes out to their territory and 1) goes door-to-door and asks parents if they can pick their kids up on the bus and bring them to church on Sunday, and 2) visits current riders and asks them if they are coming the next day. Then early Sunday morning, the buses go out and pick up the kids, bring them to church, and then take them home that afternoon. I worked on the bus routes for about five years, and I worked on at least four different routes.


Anyway, the above is just some very brief background information about me and my experiences. Feel free to ask me anything about proselytizing, the IFB church/movement, the bus ministry, mission trips, myself, or whatever else you are interested in asking me, and I’ll try my best to answer in the most accurate way possible based on my own experiences

With careful practice, one can define and segment a part of their unconscious brain to act according to their definitions.  The tulpa community has adopted this technique to create companions which are fully sentient, and can seen, heard, touched (lightly), felt, and even smelled.  A tulpa can think on its own, and has its own likes, dislikes, interests, joys, fears, opinions, desires, motivations, and personality.  The creator crafts their tulpa with traits in mind, and can create anything they can imagine for a tulpa with any array of traits.

My tulpa is named Selena.  She has pure white hair, pale skin, and dark crimson eyes (very different from my original vision and name for her, she chose this appearance).  She enjoys classical music (much to my chagrin), science, religious study, philosophy, and art (of which I have little interest and never intended her to be interested in).  She is also fascinated by conflict, and insists on watching the news for the latest stories on wars and crime in the world.

Trip highlights inside. AMA.,46,4,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/efjkq/i_am_an_indian_from_the_south_of_the_country_and/,"1)      31 days with 31,000 Rs. (another 8000 Rs. for to and fro flight)  
2)      14 places visited (Jaipur, Ranthambore, Bundi, Udaipur, Mt. Abu, Jodhpur, Jaisalmer, Bikaner, Amritsar, Srinagar, Mcleod Ganj/Dharmsala, Agra, Fatehpur Sikri, Delhi), Approx 10,000 kms travelled.  
3)      12 GB of photos and videos taken  
4)      Stayed in the dingiest hotels and travelled in the most dirtiest and rickety buses, general class train compartments, with goats, vomit and poop (I have no regrets about this and my tolerance levels to filth has gone up.  
5)      Walked like a billion miles and don’t feel my legs anymore  
6)      Stayed in the desert, rode camels and slept on the sand dunes for 3 days and 2 nights  
7)      Shitting on the desert was a truly out of the world experience  
8)      I now have a master’s degree M.TP (Master of Toilet Paper)  
9)      Smoked, ate and drank every conceivable hallucinogenic (exaggerating) but didn't get high because I was already high in general from the whole experience  
10)     Didn’t meet a single Indian backpacker or any Indian traveling alone  
11)     Met more foreigners in the trip than I did in California  
12)     Got lost trekking in the Himalayas and found way back to civilization with the white light from the camera LCD menu  
13)     Landed in Srinagar on a day of curfew and thought myself dead when a guy pushed aside his full body tunic to take out what I suspected was a gun or a detonator (turned out to be a mobile phone, which could have still blown some bomb somewhere). This is quite the scariest experience second only to standing at the edge of a 1 feet wide mountain pass 3000 m above sea level that overlooks a deep ravine.  
14)     6 security check-ins at the Srinagar airport (I felt this was actually too little for a place that has military every 100 meters on every road there is)  
15)     Flew over the Himalayas, truly breathtaking mind blowing experience.  
16)     Victim of racism by other Indians (brown Indians which was expected) and then Tibetans (who were given refuge in Delhi!!!!!!)  
17)     Ate the most amazing pepperoni pizza with extra cheese and bacon for 150 rupees in Himalayan foothills and even went to a disco (didn’t dance though)  
18)     Dominos in Amritsar doesn’t have non-veg pizzas (couldn’t believe this shit)  
19)     Learnt how to clean utensils with sand in the desert without water  
20)     If you throw a stone in Rajasthan it will either hit a fort wall or a palace. The south truly pales in history, culture and architecture as compared to the north. [ no offence to anyone from the south. It simply is the truth given all the foreign invasions from the north western part of the country gave it a lot more cultural variation]  
21)     3 architectural things that blew me away – a) Dilwara Jain temple in Mt. Abu – 1000 years old, 150 million rupees and 15 years to make, 1400 sculptors, 1200 laborers, workers payed in gold and silver based on weight of marble dust they collect by carving the temples. b) The Taj – truly magnificent. No photos and videos of this place can do justice to the actual experience of seeing it in person. Must visit place before you die. C) Golden Temple, Amritsar – This one is stunning not merely for the architectural beauty but for its cleanliness and the fact that the temple provides free food and lodging for anyone who wants it for as long as you want it.  
22)     Woke up in the morning inside a train at a railway station fully covered in desert sand in Jaisalmer.  
23) Cold Pepsi is the most amazing drink I have ever had shortly followed by desert whisky. This is after travelling in the hot desert for eternity on a camel. After 2 hours of being on the camel, you can’t feel your lower body. I got high without smoking or drinking anything after riding on a running camel for 2 hours listening to led zeppelin.  
24)     Didn’t fall ill (considering the kind of food and places I ate in) but for a cold that I got from the smog in Agra.  
25)     They still use cycle riskshaws in the north!!!  
26)     The north is so bloody cheap. I saved money doing this trip. Would have spent more living my ordinary life in Bangalore.  
27)     Ate the most amazing Italian food in a restaurant in Udaipur in the most interior parts of the old town in between narrow, crowded, dirty and dingy streets . Actually felt like I was in Europe.  
28)     Old parts of all cities in the north are simply stunning, dirty and beautiful at the same time.  
29)     Met some super intelligent monkeys (that drink water from pet bottles and close lids) and dogs (self-trained to take people on treks to Himalayas, waits for you to take rest and goes with you, shows you directions when there are forks in roads etc)  
30)     Caught an American accent traveling with all the Caucasians.  
31)     Foreigners travel for dead cheap in India and stay in the dingiest of hotels. Indians on the other hand stay in the most expensive places and travel with big families and wouldn’t survive in the kind of places the foreigners stay in. Many Indians were shocked to know that I was travelling alone.  
32)     Ate some of the best food ever made on earth, though the shortage of non-veg restaurants in the north is quite shocking.  
33)     Jodhpur is the most romantic city in India (though its formally Udaipur) and I now have the perfect recipe for the most perfect date you can take a woman on.   
34)     Camels love to fart and shit.  
35)     Travelling Rajasthan and seeing the Taj should be on everyone’s bucket list especially if you are from India!!!!  
36)     Refreshed my Hindi and actually felt awesome talking in Hindi. Met some awesome Indian people with great stories to share.  
37) Predictably lost my phone  
38) Didn't read a single book or listen to songs and managed to disconnect from technology (the latter for 25 out of 31 days in trip).  
39) Every sense in the body was super heightened for the entire trip  
40) Wrote a whole book about the trip with a fountain pen!!!! [realized I actually missed writing with a pen, felt primitive and awesome at the same time!!!!]  
41) Entire trip was ad-hoc and planned at the most 2 days in advance. I only had tickets to fly to Jaipur and return from Delhi to Bangalore.  
 42) Came back a changed person. People at work now call me MY NAME 2.0. I am more at peace with the world, don't hate things anymore, speak calmly and feel really relaxed. It was a life changing experience.

EDIT: One of my experiences is traveling to a new church with a friend who knew the place, i knew no one there. I preached and ""ministered"" by telling the pastors and elders (very specific instructions about) what god wanted them to do, they confirmed that they had heard this before, and when they slightly misunderstood what I believed god was telling them I boldly corrected them. I was in my late teens at the time (maybe just 20)...

this could be therapeutic for me.

EDIT 2: I also remember being on a missions trip overseas, and Praying for a man who had stomach cancer, its a bit of a blow to know that he wasn't OK, but that the pastor who led the trip came back and told a congregation (while I was sitting there) a carefully worded version of the story that ""increased everybody's faith"" (I only was hit by this years later when rethinking about it, but at the time, i know it put a thorn in my mind, that i had to deal with.

Long story short: Sea was big and with red flags. We decided to go in and enjoy the big waves. We swam a little too far from the shore and got stuck in a suction of big waves that we couldn't get out. After 25 minutes of fighting and trying to get out of there me and one of the other friend were exhausted and kinda had accepted our faith. The other two were still trying to swim to the beach. Then, out of nowhere this guy on a jet ski doing some ""extreme sports"" passed by us. We screamed like crazy. He saw us and saved our lives. If it weren't for him, I would not be here. 

I could put much much more details in the story, considering I remember everything and it was pretty crazy. The whole ""realizing I was going to die"" thing was just...full raging panic. I'll wait and see what questions come up and go from there!

I hate when people don't post proof, but unfortunately I can't think of anything decent. If you can come up with an idea for proof, let me know!

Well, this is likely going to be a wall of text. But, a few pre-thoughts. I've never told anyone the complete story as I will here. I've never told 90% of people about all the abuse. Vast majority of this happened in 7 short years.

To start, I'll give information on my parents. My Dad, grew up with very strict Christian parents himself. This lead to him smoking weed, various pill popping, and lots of sex with whores. All simply to spite his parents. My mother grew up with a rather long leash, but, was simply very naive. He introduced pills and weed to her. Well. Fast forward, my brother is born. Then she's pregnant with me. Towards the end of the 7th month her thyriod becomes hyperactive. Doctors are unsure if it's because of my birth, or family history. However, as the months continue it gets more and more damaged. to the point where she has to have surgery, still pregnant. The doctors fuck up the operation, Leaving her calcium defecient and seizure prone. The doctors told her that the calcuim issue in her body will make it difficult to give birth. Along with serveral other issues. I think the numbers were 67% chance of her surviving. and 93% of me surviving childbirth. Well. Obviously I'm here, and so is she. But, She body was wreaked in birth.

All this together caused my parents to sink into a deep depression. As they tried to cope with weed, pills, and natural things of mind altering nature. I grew up being bullied by my older brother(By 8 years). From having my head thrown against the walls, beat up, and locked in closets.(and bathroom when i was lucky) Well, needless to say. The small time drugs weren't enough to calm my parent's minds. They eventually moved into more damaging things. As far as my memory serves. Cocaine, Meth, Shrooms mixed with other things, needles, and heavy pain-killers. In their high state, which was almost constant, they continuely fought. Physically and verbally, often right in front of me. To give you a... Simple example. I've seen my father bash my mother's head into a brick wall several times. Well, years past with days where i either saw my parents high, or didn't see them at all. (I honestly don't recall seeing my parents sober untill I was 7 or so) Around the time of my ninth birthday, they got into a pretty large fight, even for them. I happened to be stand outside my room. There, my dad hit me in the face, and threw me into my room. All he said was ""If you ever tell anyone about me. I'll cut your fucking throat."" I simply stayed on the floor and cried. I eventually told my teacher what my dad had told me and she called the police. I was taken in by the state and waited in an home for boys for about 3 months. While i was there I was continuely hit and beat. Then molested by the older boys. This went on the entire 3 months. This, alone has damaged my self confidence, outlook on relationships, and completely destroy my ability to be sexual with most people. I'm no longer comfortable in large crowds of men, or in my own body. After the 3 months, my aunt, took me in. (Mother's sister) My aunt was... Very harsh worded, and extremely unhygienic. I lived with her, my 2 foster sisters, and foster brother. My foster sisters were both keen to hitting me, sitting on me, or playing pranks on me. My foster brother, like many other males I came into contact with. Molested me. I lived in a room, the size of a bathroom, with the washing machine and drying inside. The general atmosphere of the house kept me sick almost all the time. School was no better, I was quiet and to myself. Still teased and bullied. More damage to my self-image. However. The worst came from a single person. Tobi. The name makes my blood boil. This is the sole reason, that I wanted to commit suicide not once, but, twice. He sent me to the hospital about 3 times a year. Broke my nose 3 times. Dislocated my jaw, cracked ribs, ect. He molested me more then anyone I ever met. I lived next door to him for 6 long years. He never got in any trouble. And I was always blamed. Because of him, i could not enjoy the outside world. I had to pick. Go outside and be skull raped, Or stay in here and be emotionally pulled apart. I became a recluse. Eventually, my brother who had joined the navy returned home. I went to live with him. He had changed slightly. More violent, and more yelling. However his 12 hour work shift made it quite easy. Living in a apartment in Lafayette, and going to a school where, i wasn't bullied nearly at all. Met some true friends. I still have a few from when i lived at my foster home, but, most have forgotten me. In Lafayette, I met someone who may have completely turned my life around. My dear friend Taylor. At frist I simply had a crush on her. We became friends and I warmed up to her pretty quickly. Someone that I truly trusted after so many years. Though we never became a couple, Our friendship is one of the most valuable things to me. Simply having her as my friend I started to become more confident in who and what I was. I started trying to improve my appearance, and personality. After a year of living there, i eventually moved back into my dad's.(Whom is now single) He works a 12 hour night shift. So I basically live in his trailer alone. I attend a rather shitty country highschool. I get more bullshit about being Bi, Atheist, and Whatever else fits said bill. I've been through several relationships. Only one really mattered to me, however. And now. I'm probably going to join the Marines Asap. After that, I hope to go to college for a degree in English, and child psychology. I never want to have to see a child, with the look in their eyes, such as the one I had. I never had a childhood. I'm overly serious. Many of my friends simply view my goofy nature, as just that. But, only my real friends know. My jokes, are all to much serious. So, Dear friends. It's Your turn.

After watching this I was inspired by these digital  free speech advocates. It provided a platform to reach the mass with music and talk that outside of the internet dosnt exist. With a few weeks of research he was able to figure out a game plan for setting up his own pirate network. You can either create your own transmitter with plans freely available on the web, or modify an already built Chinese grey market FM transmitter. The model used looked a little something exactly like this:


http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51WaY3wAPOL._SL500_AA300_.jpg

With a bit of soldering these transmitters can be modified to transmit up to 30 watts. With a proper antenna this will transmit about a 25-50 mile radius, perfect for urban transmissions. At this power it is nearly impossible  to get proper FCC permits unless you are a Church or Non Profit Organization, so being discreet about project requires some creative camouflaging.

Any radio enthusiast knows that like a camera with a cheap lens, a radio is nothing without a proper antenna.

A trip to the hardware store and some antenna tuning via free online frequency calculators I was able to come up with this J-Pole Design

http://desmond.imageshack.us/Himg511/scaled.php?server=511&amp;amp;filename=roofantennafw1.jpg



Hiding the damn thing would be a feat, considering its about 5 feet tall, but he figured from an apartment complex if you hang a flag on it, it resembles a flag poll.

So far we have the radio and the antenna, but no source of audio. At the time he was in contact with a group based out of New York City that ran an online radio network, based on the shout cast protocol. This provided a way for the studio to be in a remote location (pretty much anywhere in the world) and allowed the transmitter to be dropped in any location with power and WiFi.

With a bit of linux coding magic and a trip to radio shack the team was able to modify a Wifi Router to become an audio link to the stations stream. The transmitter set up can be installed anywhere now without having to have a studio anywhere near it.

Here is a diagram I had put together about the basic network layout

http://snag.gy/kj0ls.jpg


The idea was to deploy it in Manhattan, with multiple transmitters, but we never took into account that there is absolutely no open airspace in NYC.

I was contacted by a friend who had moved into this huge house just outside NYC, it seemed really too good to be true. Huge attic that was perfect for installing an antenna to test the system out for a month before going live. Everything was set up, broadcasted beautifully throughout the town, music sounded great!

One evening after about 3 weeks of transmitting I was tuned in and I hear  a POP and the radio signal was down.
I phone the owner of the house up and my calls keep getting ignored.

 I later find out that week that the kid was not actually the owner of the house, and he was essentially squatting in a model home for an estate development! The police raided the house, and took everything in it, including my beta broadcasting system.

I was lucky enough to get away without any trouble and it was a fun project to be involved in.

EDIT: some more info...

The credit card numbers came from a variety of sources, including:
- hackers getting into ecommerce sites' databases
- hacked visa terminals (often at gas stations)
- waiters carrying around palm-sized credit card swipers who would scan cards after you hand them the card, and they walk to the till to process your order

People collect up the card numbers or card+personal info and often sell them to consolidators.  they would then  sell the numbers individually (they usually have a 'price list'   ie regular unverified cards $2, verified cards $5, gold cards $20, Cards with personal info $35, access to online bank acct $50, hacked paypal acct $30, hacked ebay acct $40, etc etc.

A lot of people would buy the cards, then hook up with a seller of fake plastic to encode the stolen card numbers into the plastic.  OR, they would find someone who could convert the card into cash, either by buying gift cards with the stolen card, etc etc, and cash it out.

There used to be (and there still is) exchanges when all these people could meet each other and exchange services, complete with moderators and reviewers who would review the services of these people to make sure they are ""legit"" (lol).

I've met sellers who claimed that they had a practical unlimited amount of card numbers for sale.  If you wanted 300,000 of them, no prob.

Back when I was 16 I had just gotten into Djing and event promotions. After some dumb luck and stringing together some impressive raves at makeshift venues (I rented a laser tag place out for about 2 grand once, and got 1,000 people in there) I decided to go all out with a team I put together and host ""Memorial Electronic Music Festival""

A friend of mines father owned an undeveloped real estate plot right outside of town, and after showing him an Event Insurance cert. we had purchased we got the ok to move forward with it.

We rented a 50 x 100 tent, this was to be the inside DJ stage for the evening, parallel too it we had the outside stage which was rented and had a pretty large pop up tent around it.

For fencing we used that orange construction fencing and used a hammer type tool to fence off the ""festival"" grounds. Each post had a Citronella lamp on it for the evening.

A friend of mine does catering and often sets of food stalls at local town festivals so we had her as the main food vendor, they had their own tables and generators and power. We sold vendor slots to I think a rave gear seller and some lady that made custom glow stick things.

The concept was to have live performers, bands, rappers, everything outside during the day, and in the evening we open up the tent for a rave experience.

I designed the inside stage with wood pallets, cinder blocks, tables, and wood sheets in the front that we had a graffiti artist tag.

Lighting was minimal but looked amazing. We had several dmx powered lights, several high powered dmx strobes, and an illegal imported super high powered green/blue dmx controlled laser from china.

Also we rented a foam cannon. And it was awesome. And the police confiscated that from me. But ill get into that later.

It was the night before and everything was in place, me and my team took care of booking the artists, mostly local but we managed to get the djs from Juelz Santanas ""Dipset"" crew.

I had just finished programming the light show and a friend of mine proposed we get some beers and pizza to celebrate all the work we've put into it.

Me being the nerd continued on programming the light show, tieing up all loose ends, making sure everything was perfect, and decided to go home early.

The next morning I get a call from my friend saying they ended up staying very late at the festival grounds, having a huge party with his classmates,

the police came, everyone ran, and they were really pissed off and are going to do everything to have it shut down.

Fast forward an hour or two later, and I get a call from our porta potty company saying the police chased them off the property. I have my friend pick me up

and we go to the festival ground, and the road is baricaded. I jump out of the car and im informed that the event is shut down because the tent i rented

needed a permit if it was larger then 20 x 20 feet.

Fighting with local police, getting laughed at by what ever officias there were in town, and ultimately loosing and having to cancel something that meant more to me then anyone will ever know.

Here I am, 16 years old, looking at an empty festival ground I designed, build, promoted, marketed, and dumped everything I had into.

Cant say Ive ever been so dissapointed, and too this day I wont go out of my way to put too much effort into anything, trying to avoid ever having to go through that pain again.

Ask me anything,not sure what proof I can provide.

Seven years later, I discovered I had been having partial complex seizures since the accident - discovered meaning: I had a seizure while swimming and drowned.  Since I was a lifeguard, they knew there had to be a good reason I suddenly went unconscious - that led to the diagnosis.  16 years of attempting to control it with various medications later, I found a doctor that was willing to entertain the discussion regarding a surgical option (the third doctor I tried discussing it with).

After several MRIs, a weeklong EEG whilst off of all medications, and a couple other kinds of tests, they had the cluster of cells that was starting the seizures identified.  Since it was only one location and small in size, I was a good candidate for a surgical fix.  They went in to remove a piece the size of a fingernail, they ended up removing a piece about the size of a fist.  I'm told that photographs of the inside of my head are now used by my surgeon to illustrate to his students (university hospital) that MRIs are sometimes worthless for showing them what really is inside someone's head - hence the difference between what they were expecting to remove and what they actually had to.",,False,,t5_2r4eo,False,,,True,t3_eomdb,http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/eomdb/iama_man_who_had_brain_surgery_to_end_epilepsy/,

I worked at said university and was one of the sysadmins who administered the machine that was compromised. While there is no humor in the breach, it was ironic to me today that at my current job's online training tool referenced this event in my life as an example.

The server was an unpatched oracle server that was used for development. It should not have contained production information, but unfortunately and without consent our only DBA shadow copied production environment to his development without scrubbing it. At that time the department I worked in had public IP space to the desktop. Anyone with a basic understanding of security knows this is extremely high risk. During my time there we migrated to private IP routing behind our own firewall.
