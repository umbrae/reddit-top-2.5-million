It was harder, more grueling, and more depressing than I could have ever imagined.  In the end though I got a job as a Professor so it was a success.

I looked at a number of schools, and interviewed at R1s, SLACs, big state schools, small private schools, the whole spectrum.  I'd be happy to answer any questions people might have about the process, or the lessons I've learned on how to prepare better.

Some quick lessons I've learned that should be of broad interest:

* Schools don't care about teaching.  I had little teaching experience, but a lot of enthusiasm for teaching.  I was worried my lack of experience would be a negative.  It wasn't.  All any school cared about, even the SLACs was research.  My enthusiasm was sometimes a negative, there are many people you'll interview with that will question your ability to get tenure if you enjoy teaching too much.

**EDIT:** To clarify, being a bad teacher will prevent you from getting tenure, and not caring about teaching at all as a candidate is, of course, a negative.  What I mean by ""schools don't care about teaching"", is that schools will hire a good researcher who might be able to teach over a phenominal teacher who is unproven when it comes to research.

* Universities want to hire business savvy individuals.  I won the most points when I discussed why my research is important, will get funding, and the experience I had securing funding during my graduate studies.  Universities are in monetary trouble now.  Showing the ability to bring in grants (and thus overhead) is a big plus.

I'll try to answer whatever questions I can.  Fire away!",,False,,t5_2sakj,1338629356.0,,,True,t3_ugwjl,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/ugwjl/iama_im_a_recently_graduated_phd_student_who_just/,
1367366176.0,68,self.AskAcademia,1dg3xn,How are things done in your field?,74,6,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/1dg3xn/how_are_things_done_in_your_field/,"Talking to people in other fields, and reading this sub and /r/gradschool, I feel like I hear and see a lot of comments, phrased in a general way, that don't apply to my field at all.  It makes me wonder what the rest of the academic world is like.

I study computer vision, and here are some questions and answers about how my field is run.  I'd love to see answers from people in other fields (or people in my field who think I got it wrong!).

**What's your field?**

Computer Science.  But I can't answer the rest of these questions at that scope, so more particularly: Computer Vision.

**What are the roles of conferences vs journals?**

Most new work is published at conferences (and this *is* considered ""publication""; I believe some fields do not consider a conference paper a ""publication"").  Many journal papers are revised, more developed versions of earlier conference papers; one common pattern is to do a series of conference papers over the course of a few years, then write a comprehensive journal article as the sort of ""paper of record"" for those ideas.

**What's the paper submission / review process?**

For journal or conference, write the paper and submit it online (I've heard in some fields conference papers are accepted/rejected based on just a submitted abstract).  In the major conferences, reviews are double blind (reviewers don't know the authors and authors don't know reviewers).  The big journals are double-blind when possible, but since many journal articles are extensions of earlier, well-known conference papers, it's often obvious to reviewers who the authors are.  Submission deadlines for the big conferences are 7-8 months before the conference.

**What are the most prestigious publication venues?**

Conferences:

- IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)
- International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)
- European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV)
- Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS) (This is really a machine learning venue, but there's a lot of overlap.)
- ACM Special Interest Group on Graphics (SIGGRAPH) (Really graphics, but overlap.  And I think this is technically the name of the organization, not the conference, but I don't even remember the name of the conference.)

Journals:

- International Journal of Computer Vision (IJCV)
- Transcations on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (PAMI)

**How much has a typical, freshly-graduated PhD published?**

At least 3 first-author conference papers (but possibly up to ten, or more including pre-PhD-program publications), and at least one journal paper (an abbreviated version of the dissertation, this may not actually be published at graduation, but should be in the works).

**Are most new professors hired directly after graduation, or after (a) post-doc(s)?**

Mostly after a post-doc, but fresh out of the PhD is not uncommon.  While a post-doc gives the candidate a chance to show more of what they can do, I think there's also a bit of ""If you were really great, you wouldn't have had to do a post-doc"" attitude that can work to the fresh PhD's advantage.

**Where does the money come from?**

(This probably varies a lot from country to country.  I'm in the US.)  It's mostly from the military and intelligence agencies (very interested in computer vision) and the NSF (National Science Foundation, as US government agency).  There are also a few companies with respected research labs (tons of stuff from Microsoft and Google, less stuff from Adobe, Yahoo, Nvidia, Canon, Sony).

 
**== EDIT: SOME QUESTIONS I FORGOT ==**
 

**What happens at conferences?**
In some fields (e.g. history, see SnowblindAlbino's answer below), I hear that authors simply *read their papers aloud* in front of the audience.  This blows my mind.  In my field, you're expected to prepare a talk, with slides (computer vision and graphics in particular are often much easier to explain with images and diagrams), of about 20 minutes.  But that's only if you are accepted for an ""oral presentation.""  At the large conferences, most papers are accepted as ""posters.""  *This is still considered a ""publication.""*  In this case, you prepare a poster and stand in front of it for an hour or two explaining your work to wandering conference attendees.

**In multi-author papers, how is author order decided?**

The main contributor is first.  In most projects, it's pretty clear who the main contributor is.  (If it's not clear, you can often secure the first position by being the first person write it up; put your name on there first, and see if anyone has the guts to challenge you!).  With more than two authors, it's not as well-defined.  Generally the people who did the most work are at the beginning, and the people who did the most supervision are at the end.  For example if a student in group A does a paper assisted by a student in group B, the order will probably be Student A, Student B, Advisor B, and Advisor A.  Post-tenure, many professors stop putting out first-author papers at all (and to *get* tenure, it's good to have a lot of last-author papers).",,False,,t5_2sakj,1367383851.0,,,True,t3_1dg3xn,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/1dg3xn/how_are_things_done_in_your_field/,
1323799618.0,58,self.AskAcademia,nb8h6,Phone interview advice for aspiring faculty members,61,3,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/nb8h6/phone_interview_advice_for_aspiring_faculty/,"I just finished 12 phone interviews with job candidates for an assistant professor position.  I just wanted to pass along a little advice to those graduate students and post-docs out their looking for a job.  I will state that I am at a mid-size state school, so some of this advice would be different for a R1 or a liberal arts school.

First, if the job ad mentions specific courses that they need covered by the new hire, and they ask you what classes you feel qualified to teach, mention the classes from the ad.  Our ad said the person had to teach two courses and 1/2 of the candidates did not mention one of the two classes (the more important one in our mind).  Also, unless the job ad specifies that they need special topic classes covered, do not start off with a long list of every special interest seminar class that you have ever wanted to do.  First mention the bread and butter core curriculum courses, then typical electives, then tack on that it would also be nice and give one or two specialty seminar classes.  Also, do not go the other way around and say I can teach any undergraduate class you ask.  This may not apply to all fields, but it is unlikely that you are really an expert in all areas in your field.  If you can cover 1-2 upper level classes and 1 grad class in your specialty, intro, some type of methods class, and a specialty seminar, you will be golden (this may not apply if the department only has 1-2 people in it).   

If they ask you how interested you are in the job, do not pause and say very interested.  In my case, we only get 3 plane tickets to bring people in.  No matter how good the person is, we are not going to take a chance on the person that said ""medium-high"".

When asked about your research, focus on your future plans.  We all know what you did, it is on the paper in front of us.  We want to know do you have a plan to get enough research done to get tenure.

When they ask you about resources, be honest and try to be accurate.  If you overshoot about start up funds or space, they may drop you and, if you low ball it, you may be stuck with inadequate resources.  Give them a realistic feeling about your research needs.  If they cannot provide what you actually need, it would be a bad fit for you anyway.

At very least look at the department website before you talk to them.  Making little comments like, ""I see on your website that you have a certificate program in such-and-such and I think I would be a strong addition to that program"" goes a long way.  One candidate mentioned a particular assignment from the syllabus of one of the search committee members.  We were all very impressed with his prior research on the school. 

Finally, be excitable on the phone.  One person we are going to bring in does not have the best CV of the bunch, but she was so excitable on the phone (without being annoying), that when we hung up, I immediate said, I want to take a class from her and I want her in faculty meetings.  Others were so monotoned that we were looking for the first pause to cut them off because we could not listen any longer.

I guess since this is Ask Academia, and not give advice to academia, I will ask others to share their tips.  I have been on the giving and receiving of phone interviews many times and it is a really hard process. 

**Edit:** I'm glad some people are finding this helpful.  I wanted to point out that the comments in [this tread](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/n3nr2/invited_for_a_job_talk_at_an_r1_university_need/) contains some excellent advice on giving a job talk.",,False,,t5_2sakj,True,,,True,t3_nb8h6,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/nb8h6/phone_interview_advice_for_aspiring_faculty/,

I was asked to be on a project with two former graduate students and happily agreed.  It really isn't in my area but I considered them friends and wanted to work with them.  We wrote and presented a paper together and I suggested that it was a great project, but, really there were three papers in our presentation and it would be a good idea to split them up if we wanted to continue.  I suggested that each of us take the lead on a part of it and the other would be second and third author.  They both agreed and we had a lovely chat about it over the phone.  

Now, here's where it gets hairy.  I emailed them asking if I could ""steal"" (in scare quotes) a part of the paper that another author had written because it fit well under the topic I was writing about.  I figure, we're all authors on each paper, so as long as nobody was planning to use this section, why not?  (Note: I only asked, I didn't assume I could.) 

I got the nastiest email back from the two of them: they accused me of bullying them, stealing from them, and disrespecting them.  I have *never* in 20 years of academic life seen such anger and been insulted in this way, and I'm especially hurt because I considered them friends.  They called me ""shady"" and said I was treating them like the were still my students and was taking advantage of them. 

I was honestly floored and several days later, I still feel very hurt.

I short, I don't really know what to do at this point.  Regrettably, I emailed them back telling them how unprofessional their behavior was and how I only had their interests at heart (which, I will honestly say, is true).  I withdrew from the project and told them not to contact me again.  The only professional person I told about it was a colleague who was their adviser so that he could tell them that this is not appropriate behavior (a point which he completely agreed with).

It's made me completely reevaluate my friendships with my students, which I always thought was based on respect.  I love working with my former students and watching them become full-fledged professors and researchers, but now I think that they're all secretly pissed at me.   

I guess I'm venting as much as I'm asking, but is there anything else I should do?  Should I inform other people about these accusations to cover my ass?  Should I try to forgive them?  Any advice from other professors (or grad students)?

I am currently about a year into a lab and already thinking about quitting.  I joined this lab due to its quickly growing publication record, but found out too late that all of the pubs were from a ambitious postdoc that left.  The PI, however, was more than happy to take the lion's share of the credit and state that he came up with the ideas although he does not understand how the data was gathered, analyzed, nor can he perform, train, or judge quality for any student in the techniques used by the previous postdoc.

I began to have problems in the lab when I found I could not replicate any of my former post doc's data.  Going back into the computer, I found that the data had been skewed heavily in favor of his hypotheses including misrepresentation of numbers, tossing out animals that did not fit his hypothesis (sometimes half of his population), and inconsistent selection of artifacts that would make our negative control groups look worse, but exclusion of artifacts in our treatment group that would correspondingly make them look better.

He also used a predictive tool on a machine that no one has used in literature, which I cannot replicate nor find any correlation to a disease state. I contacted the manufacturer of the machine and they stated that this technique could not be performed with their machine and was not validated.

Unfortunately my PI has no experience whatsoever with any of these techniques and simply believes me to be incompetent.  He even called the former postdoc over and they had a long discussion stating how my immaturity and inability to produce significant data with low variance was not very promising.  When I took my PI to see the raw data so that he could analyze it himself, he simply turned to the  postdoc and asked him how it was analyzed.

The whole point is moot however as I called in a specialist from a biotech company and a doctor from a nearby hospital with tremendous expertise in this technique and they found that not only was the postdoc calculating the data incorrectly, but he had the software set up so that it looked at only two data points instead of an average over a 5 minute period.  This essentially invalidated all the data collected for the past few years.  The PI, when told, either did not understand the ramifications of this or did not care, only telling the lab to perform further analysis the new way.

To exacerbate things, this PI is trying to gain tenure and is running low on funding so the atmosphere in the lab is becoming increasing tyrannical.  The former postdoc never presented bad news and always gave him significant, publishable data so he is completely spoiled by a flow of good news.  When experiments fail, he can offer absolutely no advice as he has no expertise in any of our techniques and simply tells us to run the same thing over and over again hoping for a different result while growing increasingly unhinged.  For example, a Western Blot done by two separate students was shown with equally perfect control GAPDH bands in each lane, but the protein of interest was not upregulated and downregulated in the fashion he expected.  The PI basically berated them, telling them to run it again with (no change in procedure) until it showed what he wanted.

I am currently only a year invested into this lab so leaving or switching labs would not be a huge loss.  I just don't really know how to go about this without a good reason.  I don't really want to report the lab to the ethics committee because I believe it would give me a bad reputation in my university (although I have backups of all the data produced by our lab).  My main issue is that I feel this lab is a dead-end.  It will run out of funding soon, the grants are incredibly pathetic because the PI has no idea what he is talking about and actually hates mechanistic studies because they are ""too complicated"".  I  feel that most people in the lab are mistreated and unhappy, and I am personally miserable because I am making no progress, receiving no training, and being berated on top of that.

**Student E-mail**:

Prof. Galloway,

I would like to discuss a matter with you that bothered me. Yesterday evening I entered your 6pm Brand Strategy class approximately 1 hour late. As I entered the room, you quickly dismissed me, saying that I would need to leave and come back to the next class. After speaking with several students who are taking your class, they explained that you have a policy stating that students who arrive more than 15 minutes late will not be admitted to class.

As of yesterday evening, I was interested in three different Monday night classes that all occurred simultaneously. In order to decide which class to select, my plan for the evening was to sample all three and see which one I like most. Since I had never taken your class, I was unaware of your class policy. I was disappointed that you dismissed me from class considering (1) there is no way I could have been aware of your policy and (2) considering that it was the first day of evening classes and I arrived 1 hour late (not a few minutes), it was more probable that my tardiness was due to my desire to sample different classes rather than sheer complacency.

I have already registered for another class but I just wanted to be open and provide my opinion on the matter.

Regards,
xxxx

**Professor Response**:

xxxx:

Thanks for the feedback. I, too, would like to offer some feedback.

Just so I’ve got this straight…you started in one class, left 15-20 minutes into it (stood up, walked out mid-lecture), went to another class (walked in 20 minutes late), left that class (again, presumably, in the middle of the lecture), and then came to my class. At that point (walking in an hour late) I asked you to come to the next class which “bothered” you.

Correct?

You state that, having not taken my class, it would be impossible to know our policy of not allowing people to walk in an hour late. Most risk analysis offers that in the face of substantial uncertainty, you opt for the more conservative path or hedge your bet (e.g., do not show up an hour late until you know the professor has an explicit policy for tolerating disrespectful behavior, check with the TA before class, etc.). I hope the lottery winner that is your recently crowned Monday evening Professor is teaching Judgement and Decision Making or Critical Thinking.

In addition, your logic effectively means you cannot be held accountable for any code of conduct before taking a class. For the record, we also have no stated policy against bursting into show tunes in the middle of class, urinating on desks or taking that revolutionary hair removal system for a spin. However, xxxx, there is a baseline level of decorum (i.e., manners) that we expect of grown men and women who the admissions department have deemed tomorrow’s business leaders.

xxxx, let me be more serious for a moment. I do not know you, will not know you and have no real affinity or animosity for you. You are an anonymous student who is now regretting the send button on his laptop. It’s with this context I hope you register pause…REAL pause xxxx and take to heart what I am about to tell you:

xxxx, get your shit together.

Getting a good job, working long hours, keeping your skills relevant, navigating the politics of an organization, finding a live/work balance…these are all really hard, xxxx. In contrast, respecting institutions, having manners, demonstrating a level of humility…these are all (relatively) easy. Get the easy stuff right xxxx. In and of themselves they will not make you successful. However, not possessing them will hold you back and you will not achieve your potential which, by virtue of you being admitted to Stern, you must have in spades. It’s not too late xxxx…

Again, thanks for the feedback.

Professor Galloway

Anyway, I wound up mentioning it to the chair during one of our regular meetings. I just said, ""You know, I've been having some issues with [student]."" I related what had happened, especially with him offering things and then taking them all back while having an attitude about it. She said she was so glad I told her, that she thinks he tends to think too highly of himself, and she would talk to him about it, but try to do it in a way where it seemed like just one of many things she wanted to chat about. So she emailed him and set up a meeting. Afterwards, she said he had apologized (to her, not to me) and that she thought things would be okay from then on.

I met up with an old boss who is friends with this student and mentioned that my job was going great except for an issue I had with someone that was difficult because I was friends with him. The old boss said, ""Oh, you mean the thing with [student]?"" So apparently it was incredibly obvious to the grad student that I had brought it up with the chair and he was upset enough about it to mention it to our mutual friend.

Anyway, things are okay now though they were a little awkward for a week or two. He's still kind of a jerk, but in social contexts instead of professional ones at least.

IAMA.,46,3,49,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/14opni/just_finished_chairing_a_faculty_search_at_an_r1/,"As the title says, I just finishing up chairing a search for a new professor at an R1.  To maintain a degree of anonymity, I'll just say we are in the midwest and it was for a business school position.  I feel  like nearly everything I could say is probably common knowledge, but if there's any interest, I will field questions.  Might be useful for those on the market or in graduate school.

Some observations, most probably obvious, some maybe not.

1. We're an R1.  Its your research that is going to get you the job.  We want to see evidence you can do what you'll need to do to get tenure.  We didn't consider anyone without at least one A to A- level publication.  By the way, we received around 200 applications for 1 position.  It was open rank, but we ended up hiring an assistant.

2. Given that all our serious candidates had good research, teaching also does matter.  Not that we really evaluate it in any systematic way, but if our Dean doesn't feel like he/she can put you in front of MBA students, it hurts your chances.  

3. I've heard people say that going to the conferences for the short 30 minute meet and greet interviews doesn't matter, or that it can  only hurt you, not help you.  Bullshit.  Get yourself to your major conference.  Once we had met our initial crop of candidates during the summer months, it was more difficult to equally evaluate new vitas that arrived in the fall.  We couldn't picture the new folksas easily.

4.  For the same reason, get your application materials in early, rather than waiting for the deadline in the job ad.  The committee is going to be evaluating applicants all along, and something of a primacy heuristic develops.

5. I was surprised that very few advisors reached out to me personally to advocate for their students.  If your advisor knows someone personally and its a school you are very interested in and have a reasonable chance at, have them  pick up the phone, or at least send a personal email to introduce you (not just the standard letter of recommendation).  Be selective though.

6.  Make your cover letter short and to the point.  With 200 applicants, we're going to be looking at your vita and skimming the letter.  Don't use cliches.  Don't put too much flourish or emotion in your letters, just state the facts.  

7.  Please don't get an online doctorate under any illusions that you are going to use that to teach at a major research university.  A U of Phoenix Ph.D. *might* get you a position at a community college, but you have zero chance at a major university.

-----

So, I just wanted to see what advice or thoughts people have about my situation.

I finished a Master's degree in Anthropology in 2000.  I barreled through it and achieved it in 1.5 years with a 3.9 GPA.  I immediately went on to start on my PhD.  Needless to say I hit some bumps along the way.

My 2 years of course work went well and I managed to maintain my 3.9 GPA.  I ended up being a GRA and then GTA for 3 years.  During my qualifying exams I ended up going through a divorce from a 10 year marriage which left me as a single mom of 2 children.  I made it through my qualifying exams with flying colors, tons of support from family and moved on to writing my prospectus.  That's when things went south.

I ended up meeting my now current husband about 2 years after the divorce and subsequent qualifying exams.  My GTA ran out and I had to get a real job, which I did.  It left me with little to no time to work on my PhD.  I ended up taking a couple years off from the PhD and about 5 years ago moved to Portland, OR and ended up with a manager who was supportive and gave me time off to finish my research (the company even partially paid for the research).  Everything was going great.  I was making progress.  I wrote my entire dissertation, all 276 pages of it.  Turned it in, started some revisions and turned it back in and faced more revisions.  In the meantime I ended up taking a different job back in Michigan and moved back across the state and put my PhD on hold again.

Now, here I am, back in my home state of Michigan.  I have received 2 extensions and can not get another one.  I have to defend in March or be done.  I was all set to finish my revisions but my current job is killer; 80+ hours per week.  I come home and I'm tired.  I can't think.  And it's just sat, pretty much untouched since I moved to Michigan back in April.

So...really, here I am.   After 12 years I'm pretty much having to throw in the towel.  Has anyone else ever done this?  I've spent so much of my life on this and so much money...it really hurts but I'm just thinking I'm not cut out for it or good enough... What's life after you give up a dream like this?

I'm finishing up a terminal master's program and have several prospects for PhD positions (*knock on wood*). Throughout grad school, I've met tons of people who are just doing grad school because ""it seemed like the logical thing to do"" or ""to have better industry prospects."" Out of everybody I've met during this time, I can honestly count on one hand the number of people who were doing grad school in the first place because they *wanted* to do research and not to get a better paying job.

Is this normal? Because seriously up to this point in my life, I always thought grad school was for people who wanted to do research, who saw a future in doing research, not as a stepping stone for getting into industry.

But anyway, eventually when I'm talking to family members and friends, they start asking me questions about my future plans, and it always goes something like this:

    Them: ""What do you plan on doing after your masters?""
    Me:   ""I'm gonna do a PhD.""
    Them: ""Oh that's great. Are there a lot of industry jobs with PhD doing whatever it is you do?""
    Me:   ""I have no idea, because I'm not going to go into industry.""
    Them: ""What are you going to do?""
    Me:   ""After the PhD, I guess I'll do postdoc research for a while.""
    Them: ""You should maybe think about your future because you've got to grow up start working sometime.""

I think the problem is because my family thinks somehow PhD Student = Student, and they think I'm just fucking around in college until my 30s. I try to explain that no, this is a job, I get paid to do research and teach, but they always go back to either not believing me or just keep telling me that I need to get into industry because ""Cousin Joe's son who did his PhD as a mathematician and now he's making six figures on Wall Street"" so I should see if I can get into Wall Street, even though I'm not a mathematician.

When I tell them my end goal is to become a professor or similar, they always ask if they make a lot of money (but never if they make a good living—can you tell money is way too important in my family? it doesn't help that my dad and uncles are successful business owners and I really do have a cousin making bank on Wall St with a PhD); and they also really suggest I take some time off in industry because how do I know I won't like it if I don't try it? They think I'm just being a kid and that I'm not old/experienced enough to understand what they are telling me.

It's really annoying because they are belittling my choice of career, and my maturity/age.

The AAUP report provides an update on the overall employment trend and a recap of important data on part-time faculty pay released in the last year. The Coalition on the Academic Workforce (CAW), of which the AAUP is a founding member, issued a report last year that found part-time faculty members earned a median of $2,700 for teaching a three-month course.

This is of course no surprise, but it is a terrible sign of the decline of the profession. At this point I am very reluctant to advise anyone to pursue graduate study with the goal of a traditional academic career...the odds are simply too low to make it worth the risk.

I chased my dream of being a scientist and I feel so dissatisfied.  I feel like I have nothing to look forward to.  I'm supposed to feel excited about writing and defending my thesis but I just feel burned out and dead inside.  I can't be the only person to feel demotivated about finishing there PhD.  How can I overcome this and feel motivated to finish?  

Before anyone suggests therapy, I have been in therapy for the last three years.  I had a therapist I really like but I had to stop seeing here because...she was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer and only given a short time to live.  I eventually started seeing another therapist but things didn't work out with her.

1322718250.0,32,self.AskAcademia,mvsv9,Someone I knew committed suicide this past weekend because she feared would never find a tenure track position....can something be done to prevent this from happening again?,36,4,36,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/mvsv9/someone_i_knew_committed_suicide_this_past/,"She was someone I knew but we were not proper friends, she was more of a friend of a friend. What bonded us was that we were both women PhDs starting our careers in academia. It's always a tough and strangely competitive world. The saying is that the competition is so brutal because ""the stakes are so low."" She was a beloved professor at a very good school, but had trouble finding a tenure-track position, these jobs were just one year contracts with low-pay and no job security (by definition), but she had only been looking for two years. 

For those who don't know, tenure track positions are hard to come by, particularly for women, at least in science (my field). But tenure is the golden fleece, offering the tantalizing reward of ultimate job security and thus also intellectual freedom -- some of us can pay a lot of dues to even the get the positions that will allow us the opportunity to pay even more dues to get tenure. To get a tenure track job, we take the shorter term, non-secure, positions to build our CVs and to survive financially. For her, in the humanities, it was contract professorships, for me, in science, it is a series of postdocs.  We often sacrifice a lot in our personal lives in the process as we have to be prepared to move to wherever, whenever, so its hard to put down roots. Obviously, in this economic climate, things are even tougher.

It seems no one knew how hard she was taking it. The web is now full of posthumous testimonials and obituaries about how she was surely the brightest rising star in her field, dimmed too early. These seem like bitter ironies to me now.

I am reasonably sure even my closest friends, my parents, my boyfriend, have no idea how close I too have come also to losing hope. How you can feel that you are doing what you love, and that you are talented, but that even people who appear to be perfect struggle to find what we call a ""real job,"" the only measure of success. And we all know, deep inside, that we are imperfect somehow, so we have to hide those imperfections to have any chance at all. Feeling like you have to be brilliant and perfect, is too much for anyone.

Students, support your professors as much as you can. It's not your job, I know, but be aware of how hard they are working and how much they are sacrificing. They do this because they love the subject you are there to learn, because they love teaching, and they love the idea that one of you might fall in love with it as well.

Tenured faculty, take an interest in mentoring the younger scholars, not just your graduate students.  Tenure-track faculty members, don't be so taken up in the mad dash to try to secure your tenure (another depressing issue, though, I know) not to offer support to the contract profs who absorb a lot your teaching load or postdocs who work slavishly to get you the data and papers you need for you grants and to get tenure.  And fellow contract profs/postdocs, try to see the other ones as sisters and brothers in arms, make more of an effort to share your insecurities and worries, so no one feels so alone and fatally imperfect.

And friends, if you have a high-achieving buddy who struggles with episodes of self doubt, or seems to be punishing herself for not being perfect, let her know that work isn't everything, and you can't know who will win the game of life until the very end.

**EDIT: I am not going to get into a debate here about women being under represented in science at the level of tenure track positions, that is not what this is about, this is about the process of getting a tenure track job.  As I stated above, it was not something I believed either just from casual experience.  But by being exposed to the data, numerous studies and some investigative journalism pieces in *Science* I have changed my tune.  But I will speak to my personal experience, in my field.  I was the first female student who successfully finished under my adviser, who was 63 at the time and had maybe 40 students finish at that that point.  As a postdoc I have worked in, or closely collaborated with, 6 different labs, and a total of 27 postdocs or research associates, 4 of which were women.**

She is also a part of my wider social circle, and as such I have been on the receiving end of her bragging about:

1. her published research on how youth (this category includes both legal minors, and young adults who are up to 5 years above the age of consent in our state) engage in X specific sexual activity, and how bad and scary this is.

2. how she intentionally stirs up a 'sex panic' about her research, in order to get more attention/press/money. She does a good job of getting salacious press, because kids these days are having sex, especially X.

3. how she herself engages in X sexual activity, including with people in the age group (young adults of legal age) which she writes about in her research. She presents this fact about herself titillatingly and often.

4. how she sleeps with the husband of a (now former) student, and has played a role in destroying their marriage. Also presented titillatingly and often.

I'm just a bystander in all this, in a completely different academic field, but I do have almost all the above in writing from her, because she has no discretion and puts this stuff in writing in a google group type thing that we are both a part of.

Perhaps this just me needing to vent. I am bothered because I think she is working out her personal demons inside her research - and that makes for shitty research. I also think that her activities are borderline unethical - especially with the student's husband - though I have no problem with X sexual activity per se (and part of why I'm angry is that she publicly does have a problem with it, while privately engaging in it). She is clearly working out her own demons in her exploration of X, which also scares me because I think it is more likely to lead to bad or nonconsensual encounters with others.

I consider myself to be a relatively successful academic, actually, but I have come to realize there is at least one weakness in my work habits.  I find that when I take a break from work, a whole weekend for instance, I lose a lot of momentum and it’s late in the week before I am back up to speed (which often means redoing some of the work done during the reentry haze earlier in the week).  Refraining from breaks is obviously not a good alternative, because burnout is always a potential problem (and has happened).  When I was a young grad student, I could work weeks (months? years?) on end without breaks.

There is a tendency among some academics on this forum to advise against pursuing graduate studies. They cite the usual reasons--decreasing salaries, job insecurity, etc.--as evidence. Presumably they are motivated by one of three reasons: 1) sadism, the joy of crushing dreams; 2) egoism, ""I successfully navigated the world of academia but I would not expect as much from you""; 3) sincere concern for the well-being of the student, which I suspect is the primary reason, but I could not help including the other two.

Certainly the concerns are substantial. Attrition rates alone indicate that many students either are not adequately prepared for graduate school or are attending graduate school for the wrong reasons. That being said, many students want to attend graduate school because the skills they have developed as undergraduates are unlikely to be rewarded outside of graduate school. Whether or not that reason is sufficient, I do not know.

Which brings me to the title of my post. You don't owe your students an alternative. Providing the answer to the question ""How should I live my life?"" is not, for better or worse, your purpose as professors. But at the same time, each of you is complicit in a system designed to develop skills applicable only within that system. It is also an unsustainable, increasingly corporatized system that charges students an exorbitant tuition so that they might pursue positions within that same system for wages too low to cover the cost of the initial expense in the first place. Moreover, your jobs are dependent upon, among other factors, the student's or her financial providers' willingness to pay for the classes you teach. We can, of course, quibble over the degree to which the critical thinking skills valued in undergraduate classrooms apply outside the classroom but, on the whole, my reasonably intimate knowledge of postcolonial theory has yet to land me a job. I do not intend to imply that you are culpable, or even responsible, for the scores of overeducated, underemployed (to borrow a phrase) students on the job market who increasingly consider graduate school preferable to positions hopelessly unable to recognize the value of books beyond entertainment, if they can recognize the value of books at all, but I do think complicity should be given due attention.

So I ask, depending not on your sense of duty, since I don't think that you are obligated to provide the answer, but on the same sense of sincere concern that motivates you to discourage graduate studies in the first place, what is a better alternative? Where can I use these skills that mean so much to me that I dedicated four years to honing them, that help me define who I am, if not within the very system that encouraged me to develop them in the first place?

Full disclosure: I recently completed my Bachelor of Arts in Comparative Literature and am in the process of pursuing graduate studies. My question deals with the humanities more than the sciences since the sciences tend to develop skills applicable outside academia.

What else should I be asking for? Is there anything you wished you asked for when you negotiated a new Asst. Prof. position? I'm sure it becomes clear what you need once you actually get your research group going...

How to rebuild from here?",28,1,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/19yjyk/accidentally_caught_my_postdoc_supervisor/,"A while ago I got a call from a former adviser, who was head of her department, that she was going over the R01 grants of the other PIs (standard in the department) and saw two of my figures that I made for *her* grant in another person's grant.  The figures in the other grant had legends saying they were something different from the original, plus some of my text from the original grant, also changed to imply my methods could do something different than it can do.  She was furious and demanded an explanation.  It turns out that my postdoctoral supervisor (at the time), who was at a different university, wrote the grant with the junior PI in my old adviser's department. (FWIW, he and the junior PI were also having a affair at the time, I found out later, which ended very ugly.)  I had showed him my work form the grant from my old lab when I first came to work for him because it was the only written document I had at the time for my technique.  I had moved to another country to work with him, trusted him, and never thought more about it.  I guess he decided to lift some of the images and text to support his points.

I was in a bind and I decided to talk to him about it because I know getting caught with the same figure in two different grants with two different authors saying two different things about it could be very bad for the PIs on those grants.  I was also a bit annoyed that he would write part of a grant based on my work without telling me.  I  suspect he didn't involve me because he was just lazy and wanted to slap something down fast or because he knew what he was saying about what my method could accomplish was not correct.

He went a little crazy when I asked him about it, shouting that my former boss was poking her nose where it didn't belong and that I worked for him now which meant that my work was his work, etc.  I managed to convince him to let me make a new figure and change the text to be correct and believable so no one would get in trouble.

Soon after that, he took me into his office, told me I wasn't being as productive as I could be in his lab and to find another job.  

Fortunately I found another postdoc pretty quickly.  I have my own reputation in the field and when the guy who let me go never returned the calls from the man who eventually hired me (my current boss), it was just brushed off and the new guy hired me anyway and didn't think much about it.

It's been a year and the dust has settled, my new job is not perfect, but it is obviously much better than my old one.  I worked for the guy who fired me for 2.5 years and was just getting ready to finish my projects and publish.  Now I have to start all over again with a big gap on my CV and a postdoc advisor I can't use as a reference.  My goal is  have a tenure track position at a research university, and I think I can do it.  I had a good and productive PhD and am generally well-regarded in the field.

* [Turnitin's website.](https://turnitin.com/static/index.php)

* [Wiki page on turnitin.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turnitin)

* [The wiki talk page on turnitin (has interesting discussions about the service).](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Turnitin)

First of all, If you're a professor and you personally implement turnitin, why do you use it? I've used turnitin for two courses (plus four other courses I didn't personally take) and I regret, in the fear of loss of academic merit, all the times that I didn't stand up and opt-out or confront the faculty. For those who don't know why I'm upset, turnitin essentially violates student copyright and your privacy by making profit from your papers (and essentially everyone else's papers since they're all stored in their database most likely without your permission) without any compensation all while claiming its ""fair use"". The fact that it's all proprietary and a commercial enterprise posing as a well-meaning education tool is more than enough for me to completely disregard it. 

On the service itself, it doesn't even work all that great. I've had the opportunity to do some tests with it on both the marker and submitter side and it's pretty damn easy to bypass its detection system (simply change two or more words about every seven words from what you're plagiarising), where really, I see it only really see it catching obviously blatant plagiarism which any competent professor should be able to find on their own. 

It's also the service's percentage system, which is prone to false positives and marking biases in cases where I've known teachers to (falsely) adjust grades in correspondence with the ""plagiarism"" percentage. I've seen it used at a university where students were allowed to submit their essays early, see their results from turnitin, and be able to resubmit it indefinitely until they felt satisfied with their turnitin score for the final submission, essentially allowing anyone to get near-zero plagiarism results. This didn't help anyone because students who plagiarised their essays simply keep just editing and resubmitting their essay to get better results rendering turnitin completely useless—of course this was completely the faculty's fault since they clearly had no idea of how to implement it properly (or they did, since it made their students artificially perform better and at a higher standard).

I've seen luddite professors convinced that it was a catch-all, preaching the mantra by which they were obviously sold on the false sense of security turnitin feeds on, and the fact that turnitin, and by extension, the professors, essentially send the message to the students that ""we don't trust you and don't care about your rights"". 

It speaks volume about the service when [Princeton, along with Harvard, Yale and Stanford, declines to use the product,](http://www.dailyprincetonian.com/2006/04/04/15061/) although you still have many other top universities still erroneously using it in some courses. I really just hope I can convince/encourage some academics here to not allow their university to implement turnitin, or if they already do, to try advocate the removal of the service.

http://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/yyrts/need_advice_on_how_to_proceed_with_a_terrible_lab/)


Anyways, since that time the lab has really not improved.  Our last grant expired a few months ago and we're running on fumes.  The lab is still a miserable and dismal place and an incident that occurred after my last post convinced me to start looking for another position.  Essentially, I found notebook evidence of falsified data from the previous post-doc.  He wrote in his notebook that he gave a group of animals treatment (including dosage volume, weight of animals, date of dosage, etc.).  However, on his excel data and in the later pages of his notebook, numerous animals in his treatment group were thrown into the non-treated/control group because I assume the treatment failed.  Furthermore from reading his previous publication, he claimed that he used n=20 per group.  In the folder that contains all the excel data for his paper, he only has 5 per group. However the mean's and SEM's in the excel sheet all correspond to the published paper's mean's and SEM's.

This was extremely annoying because many of us in the lab have projects that are extensions of his paper and if his treatment never worked, it would explain why almost none of us can replicate his data and have been getting confounding results.  I proceeded to gather up all this evidence and presented it to my PI in a very diplomatic manner.  I showed him how in one page of the notebook the animals were clearly treated and on the next they were thrown into the non-treated group.  At this news he acted very concerned and told me to gather up any other data that I found suspicious and that he would talk to that former post-doc.  Feeling a ruse, I told him that that was it.  I told him very specifically that I did not want to accuse anyone of falsifying data and that I was just bringing up something that ""didn't make sense"" and was ""confounding"".  I wanted him to make the final call.

A week later, I was called into the office and yelled at for over an hour straight.  I was told that I was an incompetent child trying to sabotage the lab and his reputation.  That the postdoc was beyond reproach.  He talked to the postdoc and explained how there was (get this) a piece of towel paper that the postdoc had written on and left at his house correcting that the animals were not actually treated.  At this stage I realized that either this guy was in cahoots with the postdoc or just batshit insane to beleive such BS.  Either way, he threatened to kick me out of the lab, report me to my department head, etc.  I ended up apologizing while secretly being furious.  The postdoc's notebooks were taken and have completely disappeared from the lab though a general rule of thumb is everyone, including past lab members, must leave their lab notebooks to help in data replication.

Words cannot describe how incompetent and stupid my PI is.  I am actually surprised he ever made it this far. During the year he has degraded me by making me write his kids' essays for college and grade my fellow PhDs' written qualifying exams (which he is supposed to grade himself).  I have given scores to abstracts for large conferences and even reviewed manuscripts that are meant only for my PI's eyes.  My comments need to be broken down into incredibly simple language so that he can understand them (non-native English speaker) and he becomes infuriated when my sometimes page-long reviews are too complicated for him to understand.  I have saved e-mail exchanges of him requesting all of the above.

Anyways, fast forward a year.  I have done pretty well.  I won an internal grant, which I ended trading up for a very large national external grant.  My PI still attributes this to his ""mentorship"" although he has never given me any useful advice in his life. The day that I won this large grant, he called me into his office and told me that he thought I won this grant due to luck and his mentorship.  He then proceeded to tell me that I had too much free time on my hands and was not a hard worker...on the day that I won a huge national grant.  I responded that I was teaching this quarter (I did awesome and had stellar reviews because I dedicated a lot of time to it).  He snapped back that he was patient with me this quarter, but he expected more work out of me in the coming months.  I was understandably pissed.

All that is coming around though. I planned my escape route after being yelled at a year ago by applying for numerous jobs and other programs.  I basically have large standing offers from numerous avenues in and out of science.  I don't want to list them here, but I will say that all of them either pay incredibly lucratively or are acceptances at top 5 medical institutions.

My question is how do I quit in a way without making too many waves?  I consider the bridge with my PI burnt as he is not a reasonable person at all and will take any attempt to leave (especially with a huge grant) as a grave insult.  He has also not ever graduated a single PhD student so it will hurt his standing. I do not want him going batshit insane and slandering me with lies so he doesn't look bad losing a student(though actually I am fairly ready for this to happen).  I do have backups of all data and email exchanges so I guess I could totally nuke his reputation if I heard he was trying to destroy mine.

I am planning on telling him that I am disillusioned with science and was given a high paying offer to work and that it is nothing personal: I just want to work and make money.  I am planning on doing this soon and giving only a few days notice because I know he will flipout and kick me out immediately.  However, I am also planning on scheduling a preemptive meeting with the head of my department, who is a much more reasonable person, and telling him the truth of why I am leaving (crazy insane PI).

I am soon to be PhD graduate who survived 15 months of severe depression and now need career advice.,33,6,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/1eiwg4/dear_redditors_i_need_your_advice_i_am_soon_to_be/,"Hey Redditors I am in need of some serious help.
I have been battling severe depression for the last 15 months and only now the fog is kind of lifting. I was towards the end of my PhD when my depression struck and as I was hospitalized for about 8 months I had to take an extended leave of absence. My professor was nice enough to allow me to finish when I got better but the project unfortunately was in a very competitive field and my results have already been published by a competing lab. So I have been suggested to write up my thesis without any publications as that is accepted here for a getting a degree. I have a lot of laboratory experience and also have been the elected representative of my graduate school and have been the head of an organizing committee which has successfully organized international symposiums for 3 years with prestigious speakers from around the world including Noble Laureates.
My depression was the result of certain repressed memories from my childhood (sexual abuse by my older sibling and cousin) making an unwelcome appearance in the conscious part of my brain. I went through intensive trauma therapy and had to work very hard to get back to my 'normal' life.
Now that I am trying to pick up the pieces of my life I find myself in a ridiculous position where suddenly my career does not seem as bright, my once wide social circle has shrunk down to a core few and everyone is busy accomplishing things while I am stuck in one place.
I feel like I am done with being in the lab 24/7. the past 15 months have obviously changed me as a person and my research which was a very big part of my life is no longer something I identify with. I no longer see myself doing a postdoc and working in academia and discovering brilliant things in my field. It was a very hard decision but I realized that I don't want to spend the next 10 years in a lab. Having said that I still love science and cannot imagine leaving the field altogether. I have an excellent bachelors degree and two masters degrees and lot of experience in labs around Europe.

I graduated with a GPA of measly 2.2. That was seven years ago. In the past 2-3 years, I've read a lot of journal articles and have developed a strong interest in doing research. I've been writing down a lot of ideas and would be thrilled to have an opportunity to follow through.

However, as far as I know, there's no way a graduate school would admit me - not when folks with a 3.5 GPA struggle to get in. I understand one possible way to gain admission is to complete another BA degree with a much higher GPA. However, a second BA seems like a terrible investment for somebody my age (a big loan for another BA degree THEN graduate school?), and I don't think there's any scholarship available for somebody with a 2.2 GPA. 

Hence, my question. Obviously having an advisor is a HUGE asset - maybe there's no way for anyone to get their thesis right without one. All I know is that I'm a very good self learner and would gladly read a dozen of the best books on writing theses. I also already have a excellent understanding of statistics (and won't stop learning). Lastly, I'm actually quite good at completing difficult projects that take long time - my weakness being juggling many superficial assignments with strict deadlines (which what UG education was like for me).

It'd be terrific if I could work on my thesis while continuing my (unfulfilling) work as a freelance web developer for income.  

**TL;DR:** Can I complete a thesis (let's say it's a superb one) without taking part in a Ph.D program, then defend it in one, and if I succeed, get the degree? I realize universities may have different policies; do you know of any where it could be done?

Does it actually matter in this present day, or is this kind of fear and stigma a relic of older eras, when people didn't have efficient ways to communicate with each other?

I'm asking mainly because I have gotten offers from two of my top-choice schools. One is my undergraduate university, where I have been offered full funding; basically, I'll be set for six or seven years in the form of grants, fellowships, etc. Additionally, this university has unmatched resources in the USA and is regarded as one of the best programs, if not the best, in the world. I get along well with the faculty, and my research interests line up extremely well with my potential advisor (who is currently my undergrad advisor). She is an up-and-coming scholar in the field on tenure-track, and she (thankfully!) cares about the mental health of her students. I can't claim she is extremely well-published as she is up-and-coming, but she does good work. (Other things of note: Two profs in the department are also retiring soon and are guaranteed to be replaced by newer, younger scholars.)

As for the other university, it is also a very good place, though less so than my undergrad university! I have not received news of the funding situation yet, but as far as I'm aware, they typically cannot guarantee funding for all five years, especially for out-of-state students; I would have to renew it year after year and establish residency in the state for tuition purposes. My potential advisor there is a middle-aged, extremely well-published, world-respected and world-class expert in the field (read: hotshot). Our research interests do not line up as well, but they do intersect at down the line, and I would be very honored to study under him. I can't speak as to his temperament, not having met him yet, but I do plan to visit next month.

All in all, I'm a little torn. On the one hand, there's security (financial, mental, social). On the other, there's this better-respected advisor and the fear of ""academic inbreeding"" and how that may affect my chances of employment years down the line. The profs in my department whom I've spoken to have all told me they don't think inbreeding is a big problem, especially in light of the school's reputation and the fact they are hiring two new profs. But, well, of course they'd reassure me of that considering how much money they threw at me, and when people look at my CV, they won't see, ""Was exposed to new ideas, two profs hired during enrollment.""

Please advise.,32,7,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/zg9cs/tell_my_grad_school_academic_advisor_about_my/,"xpost from r/depression

TL;DR: Should I tell my generally-supportive academic advisor that my complete lack of productivity is due to depression? What have you (grad students) experienced in this situation?

Before July, I hadn't had a depressive episode since 2007. I'd convinced myself it would never happen again (haha).  I woke up one morning in July and spent the day in bed thinking suicidal thoughts. Guess I was wrong.

Since then, I have been physically-present but mentally-absent at work. I have maybe a week's worth of work to show for the past two months.
Today I woke up and cried all morning. Crying jags - and my lack of concentration at work - are new symptoms I haven't experienced in the past depressive episodes.  Previously, I was able to channel my feelings into academics.

This has stalled my PhD for months, but (stupidly) I've been trying to hide it. I can't even manage that anymore if I'm crying in lab.

So I'm looking for advice: Do I tell my PI? He has always been supportive and my position is contractually guaranteed. But I worry that I might be labeled as unreliable or that it might influence his recommendation letters down the road (whether consciously or not). What have you done in this situation and how has it worked out for you?

Thanks.

**EDIT: Thank you for all your feedback.**  After weighing what was said, I am planning to tell my PI.  Regarding specific worst-case concerns: I am already in therapy in my school health center and have a psychiatric consult for medication in the pipeline, so there is a paper trail and proof of a diagnosed illness if my advisor goes Mr. Hyde on me (I don't think he will).  It also allows me to demonstrate to him that I am being proactive about the situation and trying to get back on track.  He has been amazing for the past 5 years (and I've seen the fallout of friends' abusive advisors for comparison); I don't think he will let me down.

As of today, I am sort of at the end of my rope.  I don't know if I am being unreasonable (definitely possible) --  I went to college in the 90s and things were pretty different -- or if he is just not making the grade..  He goes to a very high ranked SLAC and upon interviewing him he greatly impressed me with his interests and focus in science, especially since they had everything to do with research and answering questions, and nothing to do with curing disease or going to medical school.  He is going into his senior year now and has no research experience at all.

He is working full-time and I have him on three projects (all connected) to keep him busy during the day.  One project is experiment-based, but he can only run one or two experiments a day at best, which take about an hour to prepare (but hours to run), so to fill the rest of the time I gave him a sort of literature review project and one where he edits some already-produced data of the type he is producing on the bench.

My experience with him as been as follows:

(1) There is almost nothing I can simply ask him to do, he must be shown and given very explicit directions about everything.  I don't mind this when it comes to the science, but it's also just basic research skills, he couldn't write an outline for a paper or do a literature search for a recent paper without me showing him exactly how to do, and essentially doing it for him.  For his literature research all he ever did was read the books I gave him and summarize the information, when I told him explicitly they were just to get him started.

(2) If he doesn't do something immediately after I teach/show/discuss it with him (even after repeated instruction), he completes it in a way that seems sort of half-assed.  I will show him how to do something, then I will watch him do it, then he will do it on his own and do very well.  However, when I repeat the same process with the same task, but I let him take a few days in complete the task on his own rather than immediately after we have done the teaching session, it is clear he has forgotten a lot of how to do things.  It isn't just the science either, it's even simple steps in data entry.  I've asked him to take notes when we talk and I give him my own directions, but I don't think he looks at them.

(3) He doesn't seem to want to troubleshoot/figure things out on his own (this may be related to (1) above).  I admit that when I give him things to do, sometimes I leave some information out hoping he will look it up on his own so gets the feeling he is learning and accomplishing something, not just connecting the dots.  I mean this is real research and the age of Google, there is someone on the internet somewhere who has had the same question.

We have a meetings every day for half an hour so I feel he has plenty of time to ask me questions and we can go over things, plus we work in the same office and he can talk to me any time other than that.

EDIT: Since this thread is still alive, I'll add some information.  First, thanks for such an interesting discussion.  The student is doing a summer internship, and he is almost completed it.  Midway we had a talk where I said it was good time to switch from ""school"" mode (I give him assignments, grade them, and then return them) to ""project"" mode, where he takes time to think about what needs to get done, how to do it, and how much time he thinks it will take (all with my counsel).  A lot of people are saying here that it is unreasonable to expect a student to be able to do a literature search, but when I taught freshman (at a university) they wrote papers with current literature, and when I was in college -- before the real internet, when it was much harder to do this type of search -- I wrote plenty of papers from year one using journal articles.  Thus none of my experience, on either side, ever indicated that doing a literature search would be so daunting as to be impossible, it seems this is a skill that is passed on very unevenly in undergrad education.",,False,,t5_2sakj,1374941271.0,,,True,t3_1j425p,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/1j425p/supervising_undergraduates_is_he_underperforming/,

In the past I mentored a student in a post-bac program. He hasn't exactly worked out in the program but we keep trying. He is now being mentored by someone else that I work with. I did my best and felt I had to push him to this other person who has more experience. I just couldn't do anything more for him. I discovered today that he took something from my office, without permission, without asking, after being told several times by others to ask me first. 

I tracked him down by phone, and had a convo less than one minute long, where I told him it was inappropriate to take things like that. Then it's excuse, apology, excuse, excuse, apology, but at no point listening to what I'm saying. After a few frustrating exchanges I ask ""why the fuck would you come into my office and take X"". After that he just kept saying ""I'm sorry but you can't talk to me like that, I'm sorry but you can't curse at me."" I finally say, fine, bring it back and never set foot in my office again. 

Five minutes later he reports me to the chair. I'm not sure what he said, or what's going to happen. I really didn't mean to curse, it just slipped out in my frustration. 

So how inappropriate is this? I know it's not *effective*, but could I seriously get in trouble for this? I know of other professors that have done much worse in my department, and it's not like I was actually cursing up a storm or calling him names. I just wanted to know why he felt he could come into my space and take things that did not belong to him. 

**UPDATE:**  as everyone suspected, the final result was pretty much...nothing. Not a peep, not a whisper, not a call or conversation. I finally broke down and talked with an administrator in the ""know"" and was told that the chair told the student I was under a lot of stress (which is true, I'm transitioning to a new institute, which is why I'm sensitive to things ""disappearing"") and that he has personally been known to use that word (which is *very* true). Basically he diffused the situation. Later he came into the administrator's office complaining about having to waste his time with it, and that in all likelihood the student was doing inappropriate things. He also mentioned I should probably apologize. So basically, without even hearing my side he rooted out the problem.

I envision using it (hypothetically...) to enable certain, bright, creative graduate students who join my lab to really be free to pursue their own ideas (provided I still think it could lead to a successful thesis).


Any thoughts?

EDIT: I see there is some discussion below about the merits of playing the lottery. In case there is any confusion, I only meant ""lottery"" in a very abstract sense to encompass any fortunate event that leads to great personal wealth for the professor. There are many plausible ways in which this could occur in my field, engineering, such as through a valuable patent or a start up company that gets acquired.

EDIT 2: I understand the need for recognition via external funding as a necessary part of getting tenure. However, if personal funds can be used to accelerate the discovery of an important phenomenon or develop a sorely needed technology, I think (perhaps naively) that the potential benefits to society would outweigh the risk of stigma for self-funding.

I have 2 conference publications and have 1 more currently under review in a journal. Hardly a good number. Lately, I feel I am not capable of good research and am not able to contribute at all to my work for the past 2 months or so.

I am a 28 year old undergrad, recently returning to school after several years.  I have taken classes previously, so this is not my first set of classes.  I have never encountered the situation that I have with the class I finished this week.

The class started out well enough.  The professor was very engaging during his lectures.  It was a normal lecture class.  The professor did point out a few times that this was a basic class, that we weren't going to go to in depth into subjects as there was a lot to cover.  This was frustrating to me, because I actually enjoy the subject this class was in.  The hour and a half long class was normally dismissed after an hour.  Then the professor started to miss classes.  Over the course of the semester, from mid-August to the first week of December, the professor missed five classes.  He also did not hold a class on the day before Thanksgiving (not blaming him on that, but adding to the picture).  As more and more classes were missed, the class became more rushed.  The syllabus was changed, an exam was dropped, leaving the essay paper and the remaining tests to be worth more points.  More classes were missed and in class lectures turned to the professor printing out the class notes and handing them out in class with a little bit of discussion.  The final straw was on the last class prior to the exam, the professor started the class by handing out five pages of notes to hurry through the final chapters of the book.  After a little discussion and about twenty minutes, the class was dismissed.  On our final test, the professor weighted the exam, guaranteeing a certain amount of points before the test was even taken.

I do not feel that I learned much more from the class then I would have learned from reading Wikipedia.  I do feel that I paid for a class I got nothing out of.  As an aside, prior to the final test I had an A in the class.  I totally understand that professors are people too.  I understand that they have families and emergencies, but I feel that this is a little ridiculous.  My question is, as a student is there anything I can do about it?  Should I do anything about?  I will not take the professor again, obviously, but is there something more I can do?

tldr version : Professor missed five days of classes throughout the semester.  Feel a little cheated and wondering what, if anything, should be done about it.

In the last few years, with the closing of many tenure track positions around the country and decreased funding immediately available to my program, my colleagues have become understandably very stressed, some very mentally ill (2 nervous breakdowns, depression, panic disorders, etc). The faculty turns a blind eye and I understand that for many, this is just a part of grad school and the ""experience."" However, we have a small handful of particularly toxic grad students for whom nothing is ever good enough and virulent gossip ensues where they tear each other and their accomplishments apart. As a result, the health of the department has declined even further and three students have decided to leave. The faculty has told us to not socialize with those leaving. 

I understand that, for the remainder of our lives in academia, this kind of lawlessness, gossip, and back-stabbing will always (unfortunately) be present to some degree. I'm a young, married student and I have mostly decided to stay out of departmental drama. I still attend all departmental events, readings, and colleague's birthdays/exam celebrations as a part of my professionalization. But, I do not gossip (woman in predom female dept) and, as a result, have been cut out by the ""mean girl"" crowd (best way to put it) because I refuse to talk destructively about others. I've had many mentors tell me to simply focus on my marriage and my research/teaching. I've never discussed specifics even with my former mentors. (hate the idea of airing out a dept's dirty laundry to others)

Question: In a world where you can forge life long reputations and relationships, how important is it to become close with all of your graduate student colleagues?

I'm in a terrible program with a terrible advisor and a patchwork committee, how do I stay motivated to start and complete my thesis?",22,2,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/y11qc/i_want_to_quit_im_in_a_terrible_program_with_a/,"This may be long so if you don't feel like reading, I understand, thanks for clicking anyway!

So I'm a 3rd year Master's student at a public university. I've completed my coursework and am now in the pre-thesis research and writing phase. I successfully proposed my thesis topic in the spring yet have done absolutely nothing more on it over the summer as I was teaching two courses (one of which had 90 students and usually a professor teaches it with a TA) as well as working as an RA on a summer youth program project that took up all the hours in my day that I wasn't teaching. 

The professor I wanted to originally work with left two weeks before I arrived two years ago and I was forced to take a year to explore my other interests and options (which turned out to be better as I found research that I really enjoy) and because my cohort came in during a ""transition"" period for the curriculum, we were forced to take core course the second year of our Master's, which made it difficult to work on a thesis (I was already behind since I had to find myself again). 

My professor is batshit crazy and has alienated herself from every person I know. She didn't get along with the other professors and just recently left the department because her research isn't in line with many of the other professors (in fact she is the only one in the department who does the research that she does and that I've gravitated towards). This has caused a rift among students as well as among professors with students. Now the Dean is after her and would love to see her gone and she has all this legal bullcrap going on and is WAY too busy (and selfish, which is the reason she is in this mess) to care about any of her advisees (me and some others, which are quitting). I've had to construct a committee out of what was available to me, which isn't all that great and now it's time for me to get the hell out of here.

The only way out as I see it is just doing my thesis research and getting the hell out. The only problem is that since the program was ""in flux"" and they never gave my professor any courses since they hated her, I haven't had the opportunity to really write anything publish worthy. I've only presented at one conference (our own department's student conference) and I feel like a huge failure. I'm losing steam and hate teaching and am not sure I want to deal with all this academia bullshit. I'm moving further away from the theories and actual field that I'm in (linguistics) and gravitating more towards anthropology and have a pretty good idea of what I'd like to find in a PhD program. My only problem is I feel like I may not get into any good Anthro PhD programs. I don't have decent enough relationships with my committee to trust they can write good recommendations about my work and also I haven't published anything.

I've kept holding out and saying that things would get better but I feel like I should have quit when the professor I wanted to work with left (though I would have never found my passion in research). Like I said, I'm not sure if I'm actually cut our for academia or if it's because of the experience I'm having with a shitty program and a shitty professor. 

Please tell me some of you have been in this position and tell me what you did. I mean, I'm not scared of my Thesis (though it's such a huge project it could almost be a PhD dissertation).  I want to get the hell out of here, but I have really low GRE scores (I'm lucky I even got into an M.A. program that funded me) and I think my references will be less than stellar as only one of them (the batshit crazy one) understands my research and can actually speak about it, which anthropologists will understand.

I'm currently doing a PhD in computer science at a university I'll keep anonymous. I will have been in this program for 3 years at the end of the coming summer. I'm at a point where I'm considering quitting, either to change university or to simply go on the job market.

I have good funding and I like computer science. I like the work that I do, but my advisor is (in my opinion) simply terrible. I did my undergrad and MSc at McGill and I had a great time, got along with my two advisors there great, but I decided to change university because of some advice I had received, which was that you shouldn't do your undergrad, masters and PhD at the same university. I very much regret having done the switch.

My PhD advisor is lazy. You have to bug him alot to get forms signed. He's also too disorganized to use an agenda. I was used to having weekly meetings with my advisors in the past. He can't be bothered to give me a meeting time. I have to ask him for a meeting, and he will say ""next week"" or ""next monday"". I might show up and find that he didn't come in that day. If he's in, he might tell me that he's too busy with something else, and that I should come back in 30 minutes. The current situation is that I haven't had a one-on-one meeting with him in at least two months.

I also feel rather demotivated by his attitude about my research. He's lazy, but also very controlling. He doesn't seem to believe in my research very much. I originally came to him with the main idea for my PhD thesis. I had to argue endlessly to convince him it was worthwhile. He eventually got convinced... When another researcher announced he was ready to publish positive results about the very same idea I came up with and essentially beat me to the punch a few months ago.

I feel like my advisor stalled my research work uselessly, and that I could have published months before this other guy. Now, my advisor is telling me I'll need to publish something more novel, prove I can do better than the competition. Except I barely have any motivation left. I feel I have other ideas worth publishing about, but my advisor's attitude is always the same crap. He doesn't want to take any risks. He basically wants you to prove that something will work ahead of time, only then is it worth studying.

I'm not quite sure what to do. I'm about halfway through my PhD, but I hate working here. The people I'm working with are unpleasant, ideologically conservative, closed to new ideas. The exact opposite of what I feel researchers should be about. I generally feel unappreciated. I also feel that the treatment I get is perhaps unfair. Other students seem allowed to do whatever they want without so much tension. It may have something to do with my female/trans status, but this isn't something I can measure objectively.

Advice or moral support would be appreciated. I will say that I applied for a PhD at McGill (where I did my MSc) last semester and got accepted. My advisors there advised against me switching university, however, on the grounds that this would extend my PhD, I wouldn't get as much funding and it and wouldn't look as good on my CV.

None of what she believes is supported by any evidence, and I think she is still simply acclimating to this type of study that is going to be her life for the next 6 years.  She gets extremely stressed out, denigrates herself and says that she is a shitty PhD student, and says that she needs to be working MORE.  Most of this is following the 3 stressful weeks she had preparing her proposal the NSF-GRFP deadline before Thanksgiving, so I am hoping she is still coming down from that.

She also complains that her advisor never tells her ""good job"" or reaffirms her effort.

The head of the university department likes to design team-taught classes where he is the central coordinator but he farms out a lot of the lecturing (mostly to adjuncts, since the department is not strong in the fields he teaches).    In addition, the material for all these courses overlaps and he can – with modifications – use some of the same lectures and labs for each.  Overall, I think this is a brilliant plan and fair as I am duly compensated for my lectures.  He recruited me as faculty and overall this has been a positive experience.

The issues is that I have noticed this pattern: I will give a lecture in a class and then later (in the week or the month) he will say he is in a real bind about teaching similar material in another class and can he use my lecture slides?  He usually asks days if not hours before the actual class, and I feel compelled to say yes.  (On at least one occasion he asked me to give the lecture myself, but I have made it clear that I only have the time I commit at the beginning of each semester and this is immutable when it comes to a week-killer like giving an extra lecture at a far-away location.)

I only just noticed this pattern.  I feel that I am paid for the time I put into preparing for the course as well as for the time I spend actually teaching, and those lecture slides and labs represent a significant time investment.  Should I be compensated in some way for giving him these lectures or is it just the collegial thing to do?

He stored leftover food and drinks from an event in the office, promising to pick it up the next day. He said I could take whatever I wanted in exchange for storing the stuff.

The relationship went pretty far - we got engaged and paid a deposit for our wedding reception after two years of dating. It didn't work out for a multitude of reasons, but mainly because it was an unhealthy situation emotionally - he was controlling and had a lot of issues (divorce, abuse), and I would go as far to say that he was emotionally abusive.

Fast forward to the present. I'm in a healthy relationship now, ABD, teaching, and overall content with the way things are. Suddenly, said professor comes to my office out of the blue (he's at a different university). It kind of ripped me up inside, as I thought I'd dealt with this, but apparently I'd just been pretending not to care. I was excited and happy to see him, but on the other hand, it felt horrible.

So much of this relationship has shaped who I am now - my career path, my field of study, the desire to 'one up' or outdo him academically, how I view my current advisor (unfortunately I have a rather large crush on him, and I suspect I'm just projecting my past feelings rather than really liking him - but at this point I know better than to show this or act on it). This negative experience in my life in some ways makes me feel like he ""made"" me. I also feel sort of longing towards my ex, even though it was a bad situation, he's married with children, and I'm in a great relationship now.

As a side note, now that I'm teaching, I can't imagine getting involved with one of my students. It just seems so wrong.

I don't really think I have a question per se, but I'm having difficulty moving forward emotionally. Anyone have any ideas on how I can put this behind me?

For context - my field is theatre and I'm about a year away from candidacy.

Edit to add: If you recommend cards for grad students, what would you include? Just email and phone? URL of a LinkedIn profile or something?

You all gave me some great advice.  After Part II, I basically laid off the kid, and gave him some more ""soft skills"" advice, called it a loss for my research, but hoped he got something real and useful out of the experience.  Sadly, there was a subtle but I think significant denouement, poor kid probably has no idea how much he screwed up.  Because our (very busy and famous) PI was away for the middle part of the intern's time in the lab, we only had two lab meetings during the internship and he (the intern) was more than 15 minutes late to BOTH of them.   The meetings are at 9:30 in the morning and he clomped into a room without a chair left for him at about 9:45 each time.  This is all the PI ever saw of this guy, and I really think the poor undergrad can kiss that golden recommendation letter good-bye.  I'll write for him, of course, but it won't be the same.  Poor kid didn't even have the sense not to show up if he was going to be that late.

Anyway, a good thing that came out of it, is that I was finally able to codify my outlook on the common perils and pitfalls of undergrad research.  I wrote them up and [posted it on /r/biology](http://www.reddit.com/r/biology/comments/1jphvt/some_rubrics_for_success_with_undergraduate/) in the hopes that the future undergrad researchers of reddit might learn from the mistakes of others.  It got a good reception and there was lots of good discussion and feedback.

Several professors that I've spoken to have recommended I pick up Stata and/or SPSS. As I did research on these programs, I began to find other similar programs such as gretl, PSPP, and the R language. I browsed r/statistics for sometime and came to no definitive conclusion as to what would be the best fit for social science research, or even which was best to have knowledge about. Obviously the recommendation from professors about SPSS and Stata should indicate that I focus on one of those, but again, I'm not sure which of any of the programs I've listed will be a good fit for what I'm looking for.
Should I focus on general skill set in working with stats programs? Or is it preferable/advantageous to gain a specialty in one of the programs and not focus so much on the others? 

I'm trying to gain a skill set that will lead to success in the job market, but also be useful when I go on to pursue my graduate degree/Doctorate. I'm primarily scared of pigeonholing myself on paper into one program, but I don't want to waste my time with similar programs that serve no useful benefit.

I have about a year and half left of my postdoc and I should be going on the market this summer, however I know I just don't have it in me.  Over the past three years of my postdoc I have worked steadily, but have had a number of personal issues that set me back and drained my energy and productivity (taking care of elderly and aging parents (I am an only child), cancer surgery, needing to move rather suddenly from one country to another to a new lab because of funding issues, etc.).  

Taking care of my parents, taking care of myself, moving countries, and still trying to maintain my relationship with my partner whom I had to leave behind, have sapped me.  Plus, I have a very demanding postdoc. My boss is not a toxic person but he does view me as sort of an extension of himself and his own work and is constantly asking me to run experiments for other projects peripheral or unrelated to my own.  Thus, I don't get enough time on my own projects to really get them done (he is careful to credit me with authorship in all this work, it just doesn't lead to first author papers for me).  When I speak to him about this he says that this is the way postdocs work, and I just need to put more hours in and work harder -- basically it is two 40-hour-a-week jobs, one for him and one for me. (EDIT: At least at this institution, and I think in biomedical research at large, I think this is pretty normal -- not fortunate, but normal).  I think he is probably right, but I don't have it in me these days to put in those hours.  Ironically, if I didn't have a job, I would be much more productive, writing my papers and working on my projects (I have enough done that I don't need much lab work).  

I haven't taken more than two days off of work in three years, I remember needing to respond to emails about work and guiding the projects along on the day of my mother's funeral and long before my general anesthesia wore off from my surgery.  Time and again, my boyfriend has planned romantic reparative retreats for us, but I always end up bringing work along because I can't get it all done before I go. I am working on diminishing returns how, getting more and more burned out.  My ailing father needs me and my partner barely gets to see me.  I never even unpacked after moving over a year ago, because I just never got the time.  I still sleep on my couch.

I need a break.  But how?

I tried to contact him by phone &amp; email but received no response. Within a few days, I went directly to his office to find out he wasn't going to be in his office until after the holiday (due date for applications was at the end of the term). After that scheduled week off, I went to his office again to find he wasn't going to be teaching any courses at all for the upcoming term and wouldn't be holding office hours. During this time I also sent another email.

Anyway, I didn't get into graduate school. I've never received any sort of explanation. I finished my undergrad degree and chose not to pursue the issue any further; but now I've found out that this professor just returned and is currently teaching a course on campus. I haven't decided yet if I should go raise the issue again, but can anyone give me some insight into this? Has anyone had a similar experience or heard of it happening to someone else?

You would need to have at least published a couple of peer-reviewed articles and more often than not you would need three or four years prior teaching experience in a position called Associate Lecturer (Associate Lecturers are usually teaching whilst doing their PhD or have just completed the PhD)
* Next is Senior Lecturer
* Then Reader
* Then Professor. So, in the UK a Professor is the highest academic rank other than special positions like Emeritus Professor, etc. You become Professor after a very long and respected career as an academic. Most Professors have published multiple books, are at the top of their field and are usually in their 50s. If you make Professor by 40 then that is pretty exceptional. 

Is this the same in the US? Is there a different hierarchy? My impression, which may be wrong, is that the US Professor is more equivalent to the UK lecturer. If so, is there a way to distinguish between early career Professors and more respected, established Professors?

Also, I should add my own experience is with the humanities so what I said above may or may not be applicable to the sciences in UK universities. I think it is though.

EDIT: I've also just been checking out the distinction between colleges and universities in the US. Again college means something very different in the UK.

What is the US view of colleges verus universities? Is there a stigma attached to one in some way? Or are they both, in academic terms, equally respected, dependent of course on the specific institution?

The dept is currently headed by a couple of semi-retired full profs. The acting chair is not a scholar, has never pursued research and publishing, but instead has built their career being an autocratic 'strong man' for administrators, appointed to chair departments whenever a dean wanted to create 'efficiencies' etc. (you know what that means I'm sure). The chair was appointed to our dept by the dean, then 'elected' in a process that would have outed anyone who didn't vote for them (everyone was pre-tenure at that time), and likes rewording history to ignore the reality of their installment over us. Both semi-retirees will be gone in 2 years, and in my assessment, the program is being left in a condition that might make sense to an administrator, but is, from my perspective, not reflecting the state of the art in the discipline, nor does it look sustainable to me from an administrative perspective without the combined knowledge of decades of administrative trickery that the current chair has. The problem is, as the ranking prof, I've said this and been ignored. I would be the next in line to chair the dept. but I seriously don't want anything to do with that job. The Jr. profs are pretty much towing the line for the current chair, and don't seem to realize those people aren't even going to be there when they're up for tenure. So, I'm thinking I have a few options: (1) Shut up and keep my head down, let the house of cards fall when the Emeriti finally leave, (2) get the hell out of Dodge asap, (3) seek to have my appointment moved to a different dept, (4) embrace the madness and throw myself into the fray of Dept. and College politics.

These extras were all exposition on very basic concepts anyone should know going into a class like this, but I wanted to be sure we were all on the same page for the lecture because not everyone had the same preparation in content or level.

Naturally, my lecture slides are up before the lecture and everyone can access them.  However, it seems there is a movement -- at least from some students in the class-- to have me make some extra slides that include these more basic points that I stopped to illustrate the ""old-fashioned"" way.  I could do this, but my instinct is to reject this request because I feel it is spoon-feeding them information. All these concepts are in a beginner textbook for a 101 class, and I think it is really up to them if they want more review.  I almost regret covering the background in such detail, but my love of the topic compelled me to go over it again so that it would be fresh and people could understand the full impact of the material covered in the lecture.

So, should I type out the notes for the students or tell them to review the material themselves?

I'm only in my first year as a PhD student, but I've been an active undergraduate researcher (3.5 of the 4 years I was in college) and did what turned into a 3 year MS.

I've had ""I should just quit"" feelings before due to stress. I know that sometimes I fluctuate between being an amazing scientist and being a fool that no one has figured out yet. Lately, though, it feels like I just don't have the passion and dedication everyone else around me has.

I have read a lot of articles like those listed below, and together with a terrible postdoc experience I am now thinking seriously of leaving science. I was wondering if anyone could provide any counterpoint as to why I should stay?

I have always wanted to do science, I enjoyed my PhD a lot, but after a year of postdoc in a 'top' lab I have come to realise most of the reasons I thought this would be a good career are not true. I am grinding my teeth away, not sleeping, drinking too much, unable to visit my family for a year. I have back problems from clenching my jaw all day and the general tension. I don't want to meet new people because when the inevitable ""what do you do?"" or ""how long have you been in the country?"" questions come up all I have is negative things to say. I used to be such a relaxed and happy person and I don't know how I ended up here. I thought the point of taking science with its crappy pay, crappy career prospects and crappy working conditions was to avoid ending up in this state in my thirties. 

I thought science would be a more relaxed career, where the compromise for the things above was that you get to be an independent thinker and pursue your own interests; flexible hours, the possibility to travel and work remotely and that you wouldn't be a slave to a corporation; that you would be out of the rat race and life wouldn't be dominated by petty personal politics. But I'm finding science is even more of a rat race than the rat race, you are even more of a slave than in a corporation (everyone is a slave for the glory of the PI). Politics and petty infighting is much worse than anything I experienced during my time working in a company before coming back to study. Everything is about grants and papers, an interesting idea that might take a bit of time to flesh out gets ignored because it is more important to work on something that gets published this year. I can look forward to the next 5-10 years of putting all my savings towards international moves every 2-3 years (I already spent all my existing savings moving to my current lab), no pension (I am early thirties), no possibility to settle down anywhere. Meanwhile all my friends from school and university are having great lives, having children, lovely weddings, going on holidays or doing hobbies that they love. I see all these things flash up on Facebook and think about how I last had a vacation with my wife in 2004, and how I gave up my twenties studying for this and I think what I am doing?

I don't have any teaching responsibilities, I am not personally required to bring in grants and I don't have any onerous administration to deal with - this is supposed to be the best time of my scientific career, but I'm hating it, so I don't know where I am supposed to go from here.  I know a lot of this is coming from the poisonous atmosphere in my current lab, and I am looking at other postdocs (in fact I have a definite opportunity to continue in science if I want to with a position in a different country) but I look at the salary and the prospects for the rest of my life and old age and I really can't see how its a good decision to make. At the same time I don't want to feel like a quitter or a failure or one that couldn't make it. But I just don't get excited anymore about writing papers, I find it a bit meaningless working so hard to churn out articles that realistically no one, or at least very few people are going to read. I don't agree with the broken system of closed access academic publishing.

In conclusion, I don't feel like I enjoy or believe enough in the work I'm doing to continue working towards an academic career. But my emotions are mixed, because I think this is a real shame. Hence my question - if anyone can point to any counterpoints to the below (particularly the first two) that might change my thinking I would be very grateful. Thanks for reading.

Or sometimes they know less, and then I can help get them on the right track. And honestly, right now, the introductory stuff is pretty dry. I thought I was spicing it up by having a discussion instead of just telling them facts.

TL;DR: Have a flipped classroom. Told students where to find a list of information if they want to look at it. (It is not on the exam). Was asked 'Are we not learning that in this class?'.

In Fall 2012 I obtained my doctorate in math. A colleague offered me a position as a postdoc in his research group, which I accepted; and for the last year, I have been working here. 

On the face of it, everything seems to be going excellently. Not to toot my own horn, but this year I've published a fair number of papers, and I'm working on more, and my work is getting a good amount of interest from other people in the area, and the subject I'm studying seems to be gathering some momentum. So yeah, life is good. 

Only... well, only now I'm working on applications for other postdoctoral positions after this one and I am having serious doubts if this is what I actually want for my life. I enjoy the topic, and I like to think that I'm not rubbish at it; but after having focused essentially *only* on it for the last five years or so, I must say that I am getting a little stir-crazy. I get that specialization is an inevitable element of modern research; but still, there is such a thing as crippling overspecialization, and I think I'm getting dangerously close to it.

So I've been thinking about taking one year off the academic career and get a MSc in computer science instead (I looked, and I can definitely get it in one year). It would not be a total change of direction: there are connections between what I've been doing and some aspects of computer science, and my gut feeling is that it would not hurt me to be a little more aware of the practical side of things. Plus, I enjoy programming, and I'd like for my future research to produce not only theorems but also code (yes, I know, by the [Curry-Howard isomorphism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curry-Howard_Isomorphism) theorems are code and code is theorems, but you get what I mean :-) ).

But on the other hand... while I have enough saved up that I won't go into debt by making this choice (otherwise, I wouldn't even consider the idea), this *would* blow up a considerable chunk of my savings. Also - and this is perhaps more worrying - it would eat one year of my time that I could otherwise use to publish more papers and further my career. 

Some of my friends, to whom I mentioned this idea, said that they think I could probably study computer science on my own while doing postdocs, but I dunno - I can probably learn *something*, but not nearly as much as I think I could pick up in a structured and focused learning environment. Also, this is a bit silly, but I kind of miss getting high grades ;-)

5th year PhD student in a biological science. At my last committee, in the middle of October, I was given the feedback that defending this August was unlikely, and I should consider doing it in December. Based on how things have gone since then, I have settled into that fact. Apparently my adviser has not. It came out last week that pretty much all of our funding runs out this summer and to him, I still need to be done in August. I have found out from my program's director that even if our funding runs out, because my program guarantees funding, I'll be ok if I need to stay through the fall semester. The program will help us find money somewhere for me, but it will be very professionally uncomfortable for my adviser, as he's the one who will have to admit to not properly planning lab finances. All my data collection will be done next month and I'll only be writing after this.

I'm pretty freaked out because my adviser has made it clear that he thinks I'm trying to stretch what to him should be a five year PhD into another semester. I'm trying to be cognizant that my committee has told me that August is unreasonable. The two complicating factors are that I'm not a fast/confident writer, and my adviser is not known for being... present shall we say?   
I'm working on my writing problems.  I've started working with the university's writing center, and I've been signing up for any writers/thesis retreats they offer. And because my adviser's style of feedback on writing is pretty much nonexistent, one of the post docs in the lab is helping me with feedback on my first data chapter/paper. I don't see feedback changing much from my adviser over the next four months, however. And trying to get him to talk to me about how to handle post-doc stuff has been nothing short of frustrating.

I'm not even sure what I'm looking for here, or why I've written this out.   

I talked to my program's director yesterday about what has been happening. I talked to an adviser associated with my training grant today (I'm no longer officially funded under the training grant, but they consider us students on the grant for our entire tenure as students here). At least one of my committee members knows explicitly what has been happening. Two others know some of the details, one of whom knows very well what kind of person my adviser is. And I've asked my last committee member to sit and chat with me sometime soon. I consider talking to my committee members important in general, so it's not unusual for me to ask to sit and chat with any of them.

Other than continuing to try and make progress on getting shit done, I'm not sure what else I should be doing.  I have this fear that no matter what I do, I'm the one who is going to get screwed over in all of this. While I want nothing more than to be done with this individual, I also realize that I need to be mindful of what I say and how I handle things, because he could pretty much kill my chances (perhaps) of continuing in research (I don't want to be a professor, but I do want to stay in research, as I love it).

For the first 6 years in school, we were good friends and while she was a bit annoying sometimes with playing victim, I didn't mind because those behaviors didn't affect me directly. We both ended up in the same lab for postdoc but have different mentors. But this year we are both applying for the same tenure-track faculty positions at the same universities, and I am stressed out in my daily interactions with her.

It's common in our field to have a recommendation letter from the lab director. The first thing that annoyed me was she convinced the director we both shared to write her recommendation letter and not mine, and while this director claims it's because she worked more closely with her and that it would hurt both our chances if she wrote letters for two people in the same department, my director later admitted that it was because my friend complained and was very sensitive to these ""issues"" of us competing. The director is new to the position, but last year she wrote recommendation letters for multiple lab postdocs without any problems.

Now I've dealt with this and moved forward, but I end up seeing her almost every day since we work in the same lab. So while her demeanor is friendly and unchanged, she talks about the job applications constantly, and is obsessed where I get interviews. Whenever she hears I have an interview she will go ask her contacts to contact faculty at that department to put in a word for her. Furthermore, since we are in the same lab, I feel like she is always watching who I network with, and she will try to outdo me by talking to those people as well. This extends to our annual conference where she constantly ""joins in"" my conversations with faculty in other departments. She has asked me what I wear, bring, etc. during interviews, and then bought new clothes and a laptop that are nicer.

Anyways, I don't want to start any conflict because our lab is very friendly and we bring our kids to the park together, etc. But today she noticed me spacing out for a moment, and said something like ""oh don't worry, you'll find a job"" in front of our students and my advisor, and I got really frustrated. I feel she wins over our mutual friends better who cheerleader her more because she is around the lab more often, so I also have trouble confiding in them because she will later ask them about what I said.

As a background, I am majoring in physics and am on track to graduate early and being able to get into an Ivy League level grad program (PhD).  I've taken my schooling very seriously throughout my life, mainly because that was the only thing I was ever good at.  Getting good grades is my proof to myself that I am pushing myself to my personal goals.  Also, I have never cheated on an assignment, ever.

Our department is fairly small, so I have daily interaction with all of my professors.  I considered all of my professors my personal friends and mentors.  They all encourage group work, which we have been trained to do since our first semester, and most genuinely care about our education.  However, the lines have started to blur a little in one of our physics courses.

It all started a few weeks ago, when my friend and I went to the library to work on an assignment.  A couple of our classmates found us as we were working and joined us.  My friend and I had already worked out 3/4 questions by the time they arrived, and still had them on the marker board because we had not written them down yet.  We started working on our 4th problem and help our classmates where we could (the material was very confusing because we weren't explained the theory behind the method).  We finished our homework, answered any last questions and left to go turn our homework in.

Fast forward to next week, it was implied to the class that we had cheated.  Naturally curious, I asked why.  We got a round-about answer that didn't make much sense.  I wanted to get to the bottom of the issue, because I take this seriously.  I went to the professor's office and asked for an explanation.  According to him, I cheated because my classmates copied my work with my permission.  My argument against this was that his syllabus encourages us to work together.  Not only that, but my classmates invited themselves into our study area, copied our work, then submitted it verbatim as it was written on the board.  I continued saying that it isn't my concern what they submit, so I shouldn't be held responsible.  I made sure to make the point that I told my classmates not to copy our work, but to make sure they understood the general ""flow"" of what we were doing.

The advice he gave seems to conflict with everything we had learned up to now: he wants us to stop working as a group.  My classmates are my friends.  I've known most of them for almost 2 years.  We've had all the same classes, worked together through any troubles.  Now I'm being told to turn a cold shoulder to them.

Here's where I have my problem. I'm now labelled as a cheater by him.  Almost every chance he gets, he reminds me that I am a ""suspect"".  

An example of above: Today I was working on another physics class homework.  The teacher of this class (call him X) provides excellent lecture notes that we use as a guide during his lecture (he posts them online before class).  Then, when we do the homework, they act as concise notes for quick references.  Yesterday (during class) I was having some difficulty following my professor.  The class has low math requirements, so general assumptions have to be made to skip around the math.  Unfortunately, the homework required that I understand the assumption, which I didn't.  So I look the problem up after attempting to solve the problem.  I find the question posted in another professor's online exam, so I look at that.  Professor Y (the one accusing me of cheating), comes over and without understanding the situation, accuses me of copying the answer.  Had he looked, he would have noticed that the exam's solution, and my solution, were two entirely different things.

This is what annoys me.  He walked into Professor X's office and told him that I was cheating by copying the answers. I was in disbelief that he would do that right in front of me.  I ignored it, thinking he was trying to elicit a response, and continued to try to understand the material.  5 minutes later, he comes back (while I was still trying to understand everything).  He sees that I am still trying to figure everything out, then walks back into Professor X's office and says: ""You know [thegrieved] is out there copying the answers, and you aren't going to do anything about it?"".  Professor X: ""No, it's fine."" Professor Y: ""Well, if I were you, I would give him a 0 (zero) for cheating. That's what I would do.""  Professor Y walks back into his office, and that's the last I saw of him that day.

Maybe I'm overthinking things, but it's like he has it out for me.  Professor X has taken time to understand my learning style.  I attempt the problem, then go looking for more information before attempting again.  I genuinely try to learn the material, but try to correct myself before I get it stuck in my head.  I've never copied someone else's answer.  I always make sure I understand it.

This is more of a rant than anything.  Feels nice to blow off some steam.  Any suggestions on the situation would be appreciated.

TL;DR: Professor accused me of cheating by allowing classmates to copy my work with my permission (I didn't).  Get labeled as a cheater (I am not).

Also, as a moderator here there's not much to do, mainly fishing for posts caught in the spam filter.

I'm not a regular in this sub so I'm not sure if this is the best place to go for my question, but here goes:

I just recently graduated from university as an undergraduate and I'm doing a gap year(s) before I apply to a PhD program because I need to know if I'm truly passionate and willing to commit to what will essentially be a career in academia. To that end, I asked one of my previous undergrad thesis advisors if I should attend a conference, one that is a month away and in Canada (I live in the US). She said I should by all means go as it will give me insight to current research in my field and allow me the opportunity to network with other scholars. I agree with this insight, however...(a) this is my first conference I'm attending, (b) I'm attending it alone, (c) I know no one from the field, and (d) I have no research to present because while my thesis advisors have heartily recommended my thesis go through publishing based on its content, complexity, and coherence, my thesis was still in progress when the call for submissions for this conference was ending.

Do I just go to just go and learn about current research and awkwardly attempt to network with other scholars while I have nothing to present? The other thing I am worried about is since I have graduated and am in this in-between, I don't have the ability to say I represent a particular school, as I am not currently a student.

Mainly, I am angry that I did not receive any feedback other than ""read more journal papers.""  I even tried talking to the graduate studies department about these issues, and they said the rules and regulations are up to the individual departments.  

Anyone know of any other department of outside source I could talk to about this, I think they treat the comprehensive exams unfairly as a whole.

I don't think I am disliked as a whole, well one professor did not like me due to being a really nervous speaker during presentations, but I did the course work well for a couple of the other graders and I was an enjoyed TA.

I had been working on a research project for the past year and was told my by PI that since it was more of a 'mechanism' based hypothesis, any data would be good data . He promised to pay for the pilot study from a recently funded grant. However, a year into the study, he abruptly asked me to stop working on the project and claimed that the aims of the study did not support the goals of the lab. I gave him examples of why this project would be important and even suggested writing grants, but he did not seem interested. Anyway, he asked me then to start working on another project that was already funded and he claimed I could get results in a year as it was very 'technical'. I met with him later, to discuss what 'direction' the project could take, once we developed the technique and at that meeting, he said he had thought long and hard and decided, he did not want to mentor me. He claimed he was too busy, had enough grad students and post docs to mentor, and that I would be better off in a lab that was smaller. This was really strange, since he really hadn't spent much time with me (maybe 3-4meetings in 1yr), had spent most of the year traveling within the country/ abroad to promote his career and his book. 
To top it off, he told me he expected me to leave his lab in 3months and really did not care whether I made any progress on the technical project or not. He promised he would give me a very good recommendation and basically made it seem that the cut was more him than me. 
This has really made me depressed since all I wanted was the ability to do good work and was not in this for money/ fame/ glory. I really thought there was a possibility of working in this field but now I am completely put off science and academia.

I just finished my first semester of graduate school (2 year M.S.) and am now 100% certain that I don't want to continue with my studies in this field. That was a hard enough decision to come to, but now I have to deal with making a break without hurting feelings and wounding egos. 

I've been ill for the past 3 weeks (bedridden, basically...It's documented) and could probably swing a leave of absence for the semester anyway. One option I suppose I have is to take the leave, then later on say I've come to the decision to leave once I have a job lined up. It's kind of sketchy, I suppose, since my doctor says I should be fine in another month or so. My other option is just to man the hell up and tell my advisor straight out that I'm leaving, but is there a diplomatic way to say ""I hate this and want a real job!""?

I really, really like my advisor, which is why this is so difficult. And I'm not ruling out academia in the future...but I just graduated from college and am SO not into my current field, or at least the research side of it.

For context, I just graduated from an Ivy League school with honors last Spring, have extracurriculars I can totally sell on a resume, and got a 4.0 for my first semester in my current program.

I took a break for a year to work...great pay (70k) but I hated it, couldnt stand the monotony of going to work every day and working on the same projects, looking at the same code, going home and being sick of computers and the lack of human companionship in my life (the only person I had any social interaction with was my girlfriend).  So, I chose to go back into Academia.

Now I am in grad school, and I know that I am no longer smart.  The first thing grad school does is to tear down your ego, as you find out that the professors are just as smart as you, but have been working on the material far longer and more in depth than you will probably ever care to, and they expect you to know the material damn well, too.  

The second thing grad school teaches you is how much of a farce the school system is for learning.  Sure, school through undergrad can teach quite a bit - but it sure as hell doesnt teach one to think or how to learn; and once you are in grad school this becomes immediately apparent as professors leave out huge chunks of topic related information in the course that ends up on the final.  They know it , the literature is available, so you should know it too.

I, unfortunately have never learned how to learn.  My strategy throughout school has been to space out during lectures, scrape by on homework, then study for a day prior to the upcoming midterm or final by reading the book.  Now, unlike many of my colleagues, I am nearly incapable of remembering topic information from years or semesters, prior.  Thanks to both myself and the teachings of school prior I am now capable of applying what I have learned to precisely situations that I was taught, but only if I miraculously remember.

So now I go to classes every day, and struggle with how ridiculously unsuited for graduate school I am.  Everyone around me seems to not only know more than me, but is factors more heavily interested in topic material than I am.  I feel as though I am always playing catch-up, as soon as I finish up on reading and studying for one class, I have fallen behind by two in the rest...and the worst part is, I feel that I am not retaining anything.

Reading on field related topics is just bad.  I am not sure whether authors are just orders of magnitude smarter than me , have a knack for mathematics, or just a highly developed skill in convolution but I can tell you that nothing makes my lack of knowledge more apparent than attempting to learn about a subject by reading a published paper about it.  I have never gotten below an A in a math course, but these papers have a way of avoiding the grasp of my understanding.  I can spend hours on a paper and still be confused about what terms mean, or still figuring out where the ""intuitive"" formula came from.

&gt; When I was at Princeton in the 1940s I could see what happened to those great minds at the Institute for Advanced Study, who had been specially selected for their tremendous brains and were now given this opportunity to sit in this lovely house by the woods there, with no classes to teach, with no obligations whatsoever.

I'm a graduate student in engineering interested primarily in my research. Getting a job at a national lab like Los Alamos, Livermore, or Berkeley (Lab) was my long term plan. I thought that focusing primarily on research would be the best way to be do research.

I don't want to teach. I'm sure I could teach well, but if I were a professor I suspect I'd view teaching as a waste of time that could be better spent doing research.

But are people more productive working in academia as a professor from the interactions with students? Feynman and others I've read seem to think so.

Do interactions with students increase research productivity? If so, how much? (If not, does it decrease productivity, and how much?) And are there any scientific studies about this? (I couldn't find any.)

A quick survey of folks in my field doesn't show any clear relationship between publications and where a researcher works. Admittedly, the number of publications someone has is not the best way to measure productivity, but I can't do any better for a simple analysis.

I'm a recently-graduated Ph.D. student (in the hard sciences) who has a few questions regarding the world of academia and job prospects, and I'd love to get some perspectives from those who have been in the game for a while.

Essentially my problem boils down to this: I have no publications and have been to no conferences, and these seem to be essential to get a job and move up the ladder in academia. This situation has come about partly due to the nature of my Ph.D. (it was co-funded by an external partner and thus IP came into it), and partly due to, well, a less-than-encouraging supervisor. So as soon as I see the request for 'a list of publications' in a position advert, I get very down about my prospects.

If I'm honest, I must admit that I'm not particularly enamoured with the academic system on the whole, as it doesn't seem to offer a whole lot of security. Speaking anecdotally, even good researchers within my group that have proven track records had a lot of trouble obtaining grants to start doing their own research. Fashion within science has played a part in the unemployment of at least one researcher I know, and university budget restrictions another. So how the heck do I expect to get constant work when I'm (seemingly) way behind the eight ball already? I know that independent research centres are an option, but they seem to be still reeling a bit from the GFC and recent worldwide economic changes (and since research is by its nature speculative, it seems to me that few are offering positions until they can be assured of work coming in from industry/commercial sectors). I'm at a bit of a loss about where exactly to look, as my training has been so specific I feel that university or university-associated centres are my only choice.

I admit that this sense of despair could all be a kind of post Ph.D. depression, but when the motto of every university academic is 'publish or perish', I think there's a basis in reality for it. I'd love to hear any advice or your stories in how you went about getting into a job that's within your field, or perhaps any steps sideways you might have taken?

**tl;dr** I am a recently graduated Ph.D student with no publications/conference attendances, am I screwed?

UPDATE: So I've since had a chat to my supervisor/s and we're going to work on a couple of papers over the new year. We've also been in contact with the external partner and they've given us some guidelines for what we can and can't talk about in our reports. Hopefully between this and a good cover letter explaining the delay I'll be able to round out my resume. Thanks so much to everyone for their advice and support.

After scouring this site and others, I am still finding conflicting information on what majors/degrees would be useful/practical in this day and age. At the undergraduate level obviously engineering and CS do very well. But outside of that STEM fields have been recommended - except then you find out that a degree in biology isn't worth much. And some posts have said the same about chemistry, physics, and math - but not to the extent of biology. So then I looked at majors like geology and environmental science - but you're expected to have a masters in these fields, and to get a masters you should probably be a geology/ES major in undergrad, right? So now, since I'm not in engineering, I figure that if I want a decent job I'll be looking at grad school. So what kind of master's degrees do well on the market? 

It seems like things have progressed from college being useful, to only college education in the sciences being useful, to only college education in engineering/CS fields being useful - in terms of being able to expect a decent job and . Whats to keep engineering and CS from losing their status as fields that have stable/open job markets?

I am also finding a lot of posts where no matter what the major is, they can't find a good job/job related to their major/a job at all. So what is the point of college with all of these majors dangling in front of us? It seems like only the minority of majors lead to the fulfillment that college promises. Most colleges have upwards of 50 majors, and it seems to me most of these are useless on the job market - so why have all these majors? Are we expected to double major in one of these numerous fields that don't have any value (but fit in with our interests) and a useful one (whatever that may be)?

Right now my plan is to double major in neuroscience and linguistics (neither of which have good prospects with just a BS) and then go on to grad school for a masters in computational linguistics (UW says this can also applied towards the bioinformatics field), speech-language pathology, biological anthropology, or epidemiology/biostatistics. I also plan to pair this with a minor in Economics - but do employers even care about minors? Does this sound like a viable plan for a good job? Ideally I'd like to get a job in the computational linguistics field with companies like Google, and hopefully move to California.

I also understand that extracurriculars are important - I have a couple of things going; working for the local radio station, volunteering with the university television department, writing for the school newspaper, volunteering with a local clinic, and tutoring. Hopefully I'll have an internship this summer like I've had before, and then research in a lab for junior and senior years. I'm trying to do things that make me at least somewhat attractive to employers, but it seems like the main point of college (academic education) is falling by the wayside.

I know I'm asking quite a bit, and I do have a plan to meet with an exploratory advisor to explore majors and then the science major advisor (because I would like to major in a science, and possibly add in a liberal arts double major if possible).",,False,,t5_2sakj,False,,,True,t3_ly03t,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/ly03t/still_having_trouble_getting_my_head_around_what/,

I am a Neuroscience major, currently a Junior, at George Mason University and I have come to a point where I have daily internal battles about my future in this field.

(With regards to editing published data.),15,2,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/1gzqvl/am_i_guilty_of_ethical_violations_with_regards_to/,"I am finishing up my first year of grad school in a physical science field.  As an undergraduate at a different institution, I worked as a undergrad research assistant.  I was tasked with supplementing the data for a rejected manuscript that a graduate student had worked on but was no longer around to do it himself.

Basically, there is a machine that I used to measure a property of the physical samples that I prepared.  This machine had been acting up over the past several months since the grad student had left, and it had required maintenance and recalibration.  I calibrated and tested it several times myself to make sure that the primary quantitative results from it were accurate, and they were.  I even measured the same values for my samples that the grad student had with his equivalent samples, even though we had never even met each other.

However, the machine outputs a mainly qualitative curve of data points, and while the primary quantitative data from the curve was correct, there were still periodic nonsensical bumps in the curve.  We observed this across different samples, and it was not a property of the samples themselves.

An analogy is if you had a machine that measured the mass and volume of different amounts of a material, then calculated the density from the slope of the line.  However, every five data points or so the machine measures a volume 15% lower than the trend.  And this happens for ANY material you put in the machine.  Additionally, the lower the density of the sample the greater the discrepancy is when it occurs, such that for very low density materials the machine occasionally measures a negative volume.  So you conclude that those data points are not REAL measurements of the samples that are put into the machine.  They are simply a fault in the machine.

My professor and a few other people could not figure out how to fix the machine so that these steps/bumps were eliminated.  I was graduating soon and we were under pressure from another professor to publish the new manuscript.  I had to replace one curve on a multi-curve figure with the data from the machine.  This was a relatively minor addition among some other major ones I did.

What I ended up doing was deleting those steps/bumps in the machine output and interpolating between them. This kind of data is naturally presented as an interpolated curve anyways, without the individual points. My justification for this was that I was not hiding *real* information about our material.  To leave the data as-is would be communicating to the reader that our material had properties that it didn't really have.  I was not hiding negative information about the sample, such as impurities or undesirable properties (although deleting the data points did have the effect of making the plot look smoother).  However, I *was* hiding what we sincerely, and with reason, believed to be unreal data points from the machine.

I did not share the fact that I deleted data points with the reviewers.  It wasn't a planned cover-up type deal.  This was my first experience with publishing and I just didn't think that I was doing something wrong.  I was just deleting what we were convinced were unreal data points.  Since I didn't have time to fix the machine and re-do the experiment before I graduated, and I was under pressure in the preceding few months from two professors to get this published, I did what I could.

However, as a maturing scientist I am now agonizing over whether what I did was unethical.  Was it necessary to tell the reviewers that the raw data from the machine was edited, even if private investigation shows that the deleted data points weren't real?

What is the protocol for starting a journal? Do you just... start them?

For those wondering, I would like there to be a journal specifically related to studying things labelled by society as ""geeky"" or ""nerdy."" Posts on how D&amp;D is a metaphor for real life, how fans use technology, how to use nerdy things to teach people difficult concepts, and so. It's not completely fleshed out yet, but I haven't seen a journal exactly like what I'm looking for. The journal ""Science Fiction Studies"" comes very close on a few aspects, but isn't close enough. In addition fan studies journals like Participations are getting close, albeit in a different way. 

The reason I ask if you just start them was because I wasn't sure if there was something like IRB that you needed to go through. You obviously can't just *start* original research without IRB approval, so I wasn't sure if it was the same for journals. I figured you would need backing and support, as well as articles. But I've seen many calls for participation that involve proposed anthologies that don't have a publisher yet, so I thought it might also be like that.

A colleague of mine recently introduced me to [numpy and scipy](http://www.scipy.org/). NumPy is a collection of tools for linear algebra, while SciPy is built on top of it to provide tools for statistics, optimization, signal processing, etc. Together they are a great replacement for MATLAB.

Some benefits to using these instead of MATLAB (aside from the ones mentioned in the video above):

* They are free and open source, meaning no headaches about licensing. My institution, for instance, provides MATLAB licenses for researchers but they only allow one to install it on work computers and not on personal computers (even if you use your own laptop in the lab). As a PhD student this is constantly a thorn in my side.
* You get the use of python and everything else it comes with. This means access to things like:
    * [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/) for plotting.
    * [scikit](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) for Machine Learning.
    * [opencv python bindings](http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/) for reading images and video in various formats, and tools specific to computer vision.

I've been a redditor for a couple of years and have been relatively active in this subreddit but would rather keep this anonymous. (Also, if there's a preferable subreddit for this rather than r/AskAcademia, I apologize for that too.)

I'm starting my second year of a PhD in English at a European university, and my motivation has dried up completely, so much so that I'm considering dropping out. My intention is to move back to North America and try to get a job there but the hysteria about tenure positions drying up, impoverished adjuncts, and the all around doom-and-gloom has me terrified.

Over the summer, it became clear to me that I'm not as willing, or able, as I thought I was to ""go where the work is."" The truth is, it's important for me to be able to live in a specific region (northeast US/Ontario region, to give you an idea) so that I can be available to my family and friends, who will need me. It's already an enormous drain on me emotionally to be so far removed from them now. I've been told inflexibility about where to live can be an academic career killer.

When I get right down to it, I would be satisfied with a living wage and the ability to see friends and family. This is apparently a tall order in academia and it seems like it will take a miracle to achieve. I love research and I really enjoy teaching. But if this means poverty and isolation, well, it's not worth it to me. I'm not sure if these sorts of statistics (like [this one](http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2012/08/2012820102749246453.html) that got passed around recently) are hysterical or really the truth. It's hard to differentiate between the alarmists and the realists. I keep trying to remind myself of the reason I started doing this in the first place: I'm good at it, I enjoy it, I honestly believe I have something to contribute, the academic lifestyle (of a successful professor) appeals to me, and I was encouraged by faculty to do so. But reality has set in: no one will ever give a shit about anything I write and funding will almost inevitably dry up as soon as I finish my thesis. More likely, I will end up defaulting to high school teaching and this would be my nightmare. (I did some high school teaching before beginning my PhD and I don't ever want to go back. Ever.)

Really, my situation as it stands is this: I have the support of my department, an excellent supervisor, and no debt. I've also been given a prestigious studentship and according to my supervisor, I've been playing my cards right so far. But law school is tempting me. Before you laugh at the idea of trading the unpredictable academic job market for the unpredictable law job market: I'm well-acquainted with the similar doom-and-gloom articles about the law school world, and my impression is that, if you are a motivated, intelligent student at a top tier law school, you will do well. This seems to be the consensus among a lot of my friends in law school as well as the few recent grads (within the last 5 years) I know. I took a practice LSAT cold and got a competitive score. With some studying, I think I could do extremely well and get into a good school. The allure of the idea that I might actually have a say in where I get to live is so hard to deny.

If anyone can give me ANY words of advice... at all... please. I'm dying here. Thanks so much for your time.

I apologize in advance if the details are a little vague.  I've bolded my questions to help you guys out.  Thank you; I really appreciate any and all help!

I have two semesters left for my MS in Computer Science (thesis option).  I'm still at the same state university from which I received my BS degree.  Right now, my MS tuition and stipend is being paid by my employer with whom I'm under contract to return and work for after completing my degree for at least the amount of time I was in the Master's program (~2 years).  

The agreement isn't set in stone yet, but it is *highly* likely that I will be offered the following opportunity:  I will work for two years for my employer at their location after I earn my MS during which time I take one or two grad classes each semester (paid for by my employer) to go towards my PhD.  A good chunk of the work I will do for my employer will be used for or help me move towards my dissertation topic (I already have a basic idea of what it will be).  After the two years, I will return to my state university (the same one from which I will have received my BS and MS) and finish up any remaining coursework and dissertation, again paid for by my employer plus stipend.  I will only have two years while at my university to earn my PhD.  If for whatever reason I do not complete my PhD in that time period, I will have to finish up my dissertation while working for my employer.  Also, I will have to pay the time I was in school back 1:1.

This is an amazing opportunity that I would like to take advantage of to the fullest extent, but I wanted to consult /r/AskAcademia first to get feedback about potential career ramifications.  **First of all, I've been told that getting all of my degrees from the same school looks bad on a CV/resume, unless of course it is a very prestigious school.  How true is this?**  I'm not saying my university is bad, but it is just a public state university.  Nothing too special or prestigious.

You might be wondering why the hell I would care about my CV/resume if my current employer is cool enough to offer paying for all this stuff.  Truth be told, it's a pretty alright place to work.  The work is interesting and all, but I'm not sure its location is a place I would want to live the rest of my life let alone raise a family later down the road.  In other words, if I could make a list from most to least places I want to live in the US, this would be pretty close to the bottom.  My focus is in machine learning and I'm not interested in becoming a professor, if that helps.  **My second big question: Would getting a PhD make a big difference in what jobs I would be overqualified for as opposed to just having a Masters?**

I guess I left out a few pretty important details I'll list below:

*  I am very interested in my current master's thesis topic and potential PhD dissertation topic

*  I was interested in earning a PhD before this offer even came up, so I'm not just considering going for it because of this offer

*  My advisor is 110% on board for this and has been very helpful throughout my undergrad and grad research projects so that isn't a problem

*   I am married and my wife will support me if I choose to go for a PhD


**TL;DR:** I'm worried about the cons of getting a PhD given my current situation as described above.  

Please let me know if I'm overlooking anything!  I *believe* I'm fully aware of the difficulties regarding the struggle to attaining a PhD, and feel I can go through with it.  I've read The PhD Grind paper and found it very informative.  Thanks again for reading!  I really appreciate any suggestions you guys have. :)


**EDIT:** Whoops, I guess I botched the title.  I haven't technically been offered the opportunity yet, but it's just waiting for approval from one more high-up person who works for my employer that I've heard is rather fond of these sorts of funding opportunities.

1340115920.0,13,self.AskAcademia,v9z5e,Seeking Advice on a Teaching Focused Career at the Post-Secondary Level,16,3,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/v9z5e/seeking_advice_on_a_teaching_focused_career_at/,"This is a bit of a read, but I'm hoping it will give you insight as to my mindset.  There's a TL;DR at the bottom.

I taught high school for a couple of years [and then left that job](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/pkucu/ok_teachers_what_is_the_worst_experience_you_have/c3q6lye?context=3).  Now I'm finishing up the last year of my PhD in the biomedical sciences.  If all goes according to plan, I'll be done at the end of Spring, 2013.

My life's aspiration is to teach at a small postsecondary institution.  I'm a mediocre researcher and scientist, but I'm passionate, motivated, and naturally talented at teaching.  (It's the one thing I do well, so I hope you'll forgive my candor.  I'm talented, not skilled - there's plenty of room for improvement.)

I think small postsecondary institutions are where the biggest impact can be made.  It is the attendees of these institutions who are, in my opinion, most likely to benefit from talented instructors. 

A close friend of mine is a great example.  His family was dirt poor and lived out in the sticks.  He had a work ethic like you wouldn't believe.  He went to high school and held down a job at a gas station at the same time, going back and forth on an old motorcycle he got from somewhere and had to maintain. His dream was to one day make enough money to help support his parents and younger siblings.  

Because he had to work to help support himself in high school, he didn't have as much time to devote to school - so he wasn't at the top of his class coming out.  Even if he had the scores, he didn't have the money to go to State U.  So he worked his way through a small college near our hometown, got top scores, transferred to State U for his last two years, graduated with no debt, and is now rising through the ranks of an accounting firm and helping his family out like he always wanted.

It's these folks who I think could benefit most from what I want to do.  The average State U trust fund kid will score well and make it through whether his/her professors are great or terrible - but that guy who is having trouble staying awake because he was manning a gas station all night?  He needs me.

So I want to teach 100% of the time, with no research load.

As I've gone through my PhD, I've obtained certifications in pedagogy and academic technology, taken a course in science education, and stayed active in teaching service by judging science fairs and joining professional societies like the NSTA.  All of this is reflected on my CV.  My research record when I'm done will be mediocre at best - maybe one or if I'm lucky two publications in third-tier journals.  Right now, I have no plans to do a post-doc.

I'd love to TA, but I've actually secured research-only funding for myself and my advisor wants me to focus on graduating.

**TL;DR**:   I want a job teaching at a small postsecondary institution ('community college'), with no research responsibilities.

My questions for AskAcademia are as follows:

1.  How realistic are my goals?  Based on my background (briefly described above), would I be a competitive candidate for this sort of position if I just jump right in without doing a post-doc first? 

2.  Individuals who work at small teaching colleges, do you enjoy the experience?  How is your job satisfaction? 

3.  What am I going to wish I had known five years from now?

4.  How do I avoid getting stuck in the adjunct pool, or being typecast as a forever adjunct?  I want a tenure track, full time position.  I want a career.

5.  Do you have any advice for the job interview process?  How do I make a strong, positive impression and set myself apart from the numerous other applicants?

6.  Thoughts on salary negotiations?  How much should I expect to make starting?  Do I just go look up the BLS.gov median for postsecondary instructors ([~62k](http://www.bls.gov/ooh/education-training-and-library/postsecondary-teachers.htm#tab-5)), and subtract some percentage?  (10%?  25%??)

7.  How soon should I start looking?   Three or four months before graduation?

8.  Hidden tips for finding a job?  (For example, an administrator recently recommended that I send unsolicited applications, even to places that don't have openings posted.)

9.  Any other advice?

Though I only have my bachelors, I've worked in three different labs (neuropsychology and anatomy) and in two of those labs I was treated as a graduate student -- allowed to design my own experiments, work directly on a team with post-doctorate fellows. I absolutely loved the work, often putting in long hours after class, frequently the last in the lab. Though I've thought about pursuing my PhD and a career in research, financial concerns have delayed that route as of now.

My current job is also excellent for me. I am definitely a person who feels unfulfilled if not using my creative (and by creative I don't just mean the creativity to create and interpret experiments, but also to write grant narratives or design a marketing campaign or organize a poetry reading) talents. But at the same time, I also feel unfulfilled without science. I am definitely hobbyist -- I am teaching myself arduino programming at the moment, but relegating science to a hobby doesn't feel quite right for me.

So, AskAcademia. I'm wondering if you have advice. Should I try to volunteer in a lab (and advice on this topic would be appreciated -- if it matters, I live in a large city with a fair number of research facilities/schools nearby) or should I look into exploring a new career? As I only have my bachelor level degree, my career path is fairly open.

I'm an English major at a Canadian university. I'm currently just two courses away from graduating with a General BA. (3 year program.) I've been here since 2006, with my work habits and discipline level growing worse by the year. I've failed my fair share of courses, dropped many as well, and just scraped by in several others. (Of course, in the rare instances where I've been motivated and/or the class was structured perfectly for me, I've earned high 70s and 80s.)

So. This semester, which began a week or so into January, I've been to class exactly twice. I'm taking two courses, mind you. A third year english, and second year philosophy. I went to one random philosophy lecture, and one english period because there was a midterm for 30%. I didn't do well. I haven't actually submitted anything else for evaluation in either course. 

Now, the obvious solution here is to drop these courses and try again next time. But guys, I really don't want to do that. That has been my life for the past few years. My parents are at their wit's end, and aren't going to help me out anymore. I've incurred far more loan debt with the government than I should have. I'm tired of telling everyone in my life, ""Yes lol I'm REALLY on my last semester this time, really!""

Anyway, cutting to the chase, I want to know how I should approach my professors when I go to beg them for mercy. I've resolved that I'm going to go as soon as possible, just as soon as I find out their office hours. (I can't email them even to ask when their office hours are, because my dad doesn't trust me and monitors my school email from home.) Is honesty the best policy with most professors? Should I tell them exactly how badly I've been doing so they get a correct picture, or should I downplay it and just ask for some extensions?

How would you approach this if you were suddenly put in my shoes? I'm shaking as I type this, I'm so ashamed. But I just have to come back from this. There has to be a way.

**TLDR: I'm a lazy/ADHD-afflicted English major who has basically not gone to class or done a single thing all semester. This should be my last one, with just these two courses standing between me and my BA. Dropping out is an extremely unattractive option, and if I did that it would probably be for the last time and basically the end of the world.

In September, I along with two other undergraduate students were awarded a research grant from our university's geography alumni association. (Our project is biogeographical in nature.)

As part of the grant, we are also required to present our research at 2012's annual alumni conference at the university. We also need to present at two other conferences.

Like I said, that was in September. The semester had just gotten started and they were busy, so I began reading articles and studies and compiling information I thought would be useful in our research. I also came up with a plan of action and deadlines that we needed to meet to make sure we stayed on track to present at the conferences.

It's now January. I have been working furiously. I've been in contact with a library in New York and one in Quebec, trying to get copies of obscure articles that would greatly aid in our research. I've been meeting with professionals in my area to get more data and figures, and I've been slowly compiling this research into the paper. I've sacrificed most of my weekends since October working on this.

I sent the other two partners an email, letting them know what I'd been doing, where I was at, and what we still need to do. One didn't reply at all, and the other only said, ""Let me know if there's anything I can do.""

I replied, ""What have you done so far?""

He said, ""Nothing.""

I asked, ""Are you planning on doing anything?""

He said, ""Yeah, I'll look at some articles.""

I'm very angry with both of them. It is now too late to present at one of the conferences, but I wanted to go anyway so I'd get an idea of how it all works when we present at that conference next year. I asked both of them if they're planning on going, and they both said they don't really want to.

To my knowledge, neither of them are currently working on the project at all. I have tried to set up meetings, but they continue to cancel.

Is that much different than say a regular encylopedia or some other type of academic source such as an article in an established journal or other types of academic publishing?

The difference being that academic publications are generally extensively peer-reviewed by experts and enthusiasts alike.  Then they are sent through a systematic vetting of rigor and due diligence to extract the levels of quality in science and or research performed to produce the academic work.  All of this, just to insist that the work as a whole and in its select parts meets the considerably high standards for consideration as an academic brick in the wall of uncovered truths in and around each cornerstone of academia.

And does that make Wikipedia that much different from those academic institutions or would you say that the bottom-up construction of Wikipedia lacks the rigor, due diligence, and organically constructed quality to meet the high standards necessary to be considered reliable or truthful to one degree or another?

If time, collaboration, and expert analysis improves Wikipedia's level of quality, at what point would you consider it a source worthy of trust, if you do not already consider it worthy?

Or is it possible that every source, established journal or not, is always taken with a grain of salt and tested each time it is considered in a paper for research citation or as a source for information such that nothing is steadfast in its reliability and so Wikipedia or not, we cannot rely on a single source as being truthful to one degree or another without careful inspection every time?

There will always be bias.  There will always be fallacies.

I've got a full-time contract faculty job teaching 4 sections of the same course online this year (and likely the foreseeable future), so I won't be graduating straight into unemployment. I'm considering going on the job market for a tenure-track assistant professor position (likely in a business school) this year, but I've only got one published book chapter on my vita, and no peer-reviewed publications. I'm going on the market this soon, because I'm in a dual-career situation and I'm only interested in one job at a specific university (that would be ranked in the bottom 50% in my area). My fiancee would be in the same department. As a blessing and a curse, they're hiring for the job I want one year earlier than I hoped it would open up. 

That being said, I'm nearly ready (within a week) to submit an empirical paper that will be a slam-dunk at a top-tier journal. Beyond being highly optimistic, I've had more senior people tell me this paper is destined for at least one of our top-tier outlets. Along with that paper and some other ideas, I've got a nice theory paper that should also end up in a top-tier outlet in the next year or two.

I'm definitely applying for the job even if my chances are low, because again, I'm in a dual-career situation, and opportunities for both of us to get tenure-track  jobs at the same place will be few and far between.

My question is though, to what extent would a search committee weigh publishing potential? Will my application get weeded out because it doesn't meet a ""one top-tier"" pub criterion? I've never been on a search committee, but it seems like the ideal candidate would have some track record of publishing, in addition to bright future research prospects. If the pool was small, could high future potential outweigh past accomplishments paired a with vague and unorganized research program?

How can I make that dream a reality?

I'm also opened to selling out and not working in academia, provided I can do something similar, if that's the best way to do it.

I'm just finishing my second year of my PhD in the UK in Computer Science and have a question about balancing working in a research group and my PhD. 

I'm part of an EPSRC(gov't)-funded research group consisting of two professors (my two advisors), a PostDoc and myself. This covers my fees and stipend for my PhD. My problem is that I feel like my advisors are putting the research group ahead of my PhD studies - understandable and to be expected, but how do I avoid my PhD being neglected?

To give an example, I recently worked on some ideas pretty much on my own and got some pretty nice preliminary results (I could tackle a problem that has been infeasible for the last 27 years). Now if I was working on a solo PhD I would presume that I would spend time working through it carefully (with the help of my advisors of course) to understand the ins-and-outs of it. But my advisor wants us to submit something to an upcoming conference in our field and so wants a paper written within a month for the deadline. This decision came less than a week after I showed them my results and I'm now two weeks way from the deadline (and no-one has worked on the paper except for me). I keep discovering more depth to the problem (and previous attempts to solve it) and want a lot more time than a fortnight to work on it. I can obviously keep working on it past the paper submission but it's still frustrating me. 

It's not all bad being part of the research group - I've got six peer-reviewed publications so far (this paper hopefully being my seventh) all of which are joint papers with the other three researchers, and for two (hopefully three) I'm first author. But I worry that when it comes to writing up my PhD all my work will be from joint papers and I'm going to spend half the time pointing out exactly what my contribution was to each bit and my examiners will be left wondering just how much work I've done. 

So I guess what I'm asking is whether it is okay to be 'selfish' about my PhD work (whilst possibly neglecting the research group)? For example I was recently asked to collaborate by a researcher from another university who had read my work. I've talked about it to my advisors but have purposely avoided mentioning it to the PostDoc as he (with good intentions) has a habit of hijacking my ideas and working on them. I assume that's fine for a normal research group, but is it okay for me to want to keep it for myself and my PhD?

On a separate note, my advisor recently received a request to bid for a conference in 2015. He forwarded it to team asking our opinion as we'd be helping host it. I replied with my thoughts but pointed out that I hoped to be finished by then (it'd be 4 years after starting my PhD and my aim is 3-3.5yrs). He responded saying he hoped so too but ""in theory you have four years of money on the grant"". I'm completely unsure what he means by this - does he mean if I finish early I could stay on with the research group as some kind of demi-PostDoc, or is he suggesting I should take the full four years to complete it rather than finishing earlier? As I'm hoping to head into industry I'm hoping it's not the latter. Is there a way to tactfully ask this?

Sorry for the wall of text - just wanting a bit of advice (and to get some things off my chest!).

I need some help in the form of suggestions or similar experiences if at all possible.

This is a PhD program has very few faculty members. Two of them are very closely engaged with one another and they have, over a period of time, been shifting the department to suit their own ideas of what the field should mean. They have continually had a core group of hangers-on and this group hangs out over the weekends. They are generally the chair and one of the readers for each of these people as well.

This is all pretty standard for higher ed, and I am not bothered by not being part of their group. However, they have also started to seemingly subtly act against students who are not in this group. No one in my cohort is part of this group, and since soon after we arrived, we've experienced a great deal of marginalization. Some of this is social, as in not getting invited to parties, and some is institutional. They regularly treat people poorly. I have one of them on my committee and this person failed my comp exam for his area despite the strong feelings of my chair that it should have passed. Not only did it fail, but this person yelled at me, insulted my writing, and made it clear that because the work did not fall squarely in their understanding of the field, it was not acceptable. (Please note that none of these expectations were conveyed to me in our previous meetings.)

Much of this treatment is so subtle that it's difficult to describe and to quantify, which is a big part of the issue. One of these people continually refuses to greet any of us in the hall -- in one instance, my colleague was standing in a group of 3 and the other two people were greeted by this individual with some brief discussion, while my colleague was totally ignored although she too had greeted the professor. Most recently, one of these professors voted against the pushing back of a deadline for a scholarship available to my cohort -- seemingly voting against the interests of their own field. (No one was eligible to apply by the original deadline.)

Many members of the faculty, including the chair of the department and the graduate director, are fairly openly opposed to the attitudes of these individuals and their treatment of students. It's something most people are aware of. However... nothing has been done. It seems that those with the power to act are either unwilling or unable to do anything, while our educations and careers are continuously being undermined and potentially jeopardized. 

I understand that there is little that can be done about tenured faculty, but has anyone had similar experience? Do you have any idea of any action that can be taken?

I transferred from a community college where the focus of professors was teaching, and I was whole heartedly inspired. I wanted to pursue research and so currently attend a public research university that has many good qualities, but I am continuously frustrated by my experience with many (not all) professors who are poor teachers because they are unengaged, unavailable, or condescending. As a motivated student I find this incredibly frustrating and see less motivated students suffer all the more. 

I understand professors are hired for their research experience, and teaching is a secondary. So my question for Ask Academia is this: What one or two things could actually be done (with enough support) at your research university to improve the quality of teaching without sacrificing the quality of research being done?

EDIT: Please provide a concrete example of something that could be done tomorrow (or today!), however small, to enact these improvements, however gradual that may be. Maybe it's something you've thought of but can't do for lack of time, resources, ridicule, whatever.

EDIT 2: By teaching, I am referring to within the classroom and/or within a lab.

EDIT3: As stupidnickname pointed out, my inquiry could benefit from better formed questions, such as 'what does your research institution do to promote the value of teaching?'. Answers to such are welcome. If you think of other poignant questions to ask, I would like to hear those too.

I have real, honest, and competent questions and research happening in this subfield, and my professors and program are supportive of it. The Director of our program is so supportive that he is working with me to try to get an ""Introduction to this subfield"" class taught by me next year. The course would actually span our discipline and other, closely-related, disciplines, and we have no doubt that we could do a very successful and interesting class of reasonable size (maybe 30-40 students). The issue at this point seems to be funding.

I applied for and received a grant from a non-profit organization to cover part of the cost of the class (this cost basically being payment to me as an instructor to teach the class). But the program, which is new and small, has to cover the rest of the cost (about USD$2600). And the program may not have it. A fellow student who is excited and wants to take the class suggested Kickstarter. This leads in to my questions.

1) Has anyone used a crowdfunding model to fund a class? Kickstarter seems limited to art projects, mainly, but Indiegogo could work for this. The funding level would be, say, $2600, with any extra money raised being a donation to the program's general fund.

2) What are the legalities of this? Yes, I know: YANAL, and I may have to talk to my school's legal department. But isn't this just a private donation to a program? Are those easy to do?

3) There is no individual benefit for a donation, Instead, the overall benefit, if fully-funded, is that all the materials from the class—syllabus, handouts, homework assignments and answer keys, exams and answer keys, etc.—will be posted online for free after the class is offered. I will record video of me teaching the class sessions; they will also be made available. This will allow this sort of class to be taught by others.

Ideas? Comments? Suggestions? Are there other ways to drum up external money to fund a class? Thank you!

Background on me: I'm about to finish my Masters and start PhD in computer science.  I work in a research lab in the summers and I'm planning on spending a few years in a research lab after I get my PhD to try and get some extra publication under my belt before I pursue a professor position.  

From what I understand, the biggest thing universities look for in a tenure-track professor candidate are quality and number of publications.  Beyond that, I'm not too sure what else they look for.  I'm sure teaching experience would be a plus.  Unfortunately, I don't think I'll be able to teach while pursuing my PhD because the research lab I work for is paying for my tuition and stipend and in return I'm supposed to treat my education as if it were a job (so I cannot take on any other jobs, including teaching or grading positions).  I'm thinking maybe being an adjunt professor after obtaining my PhD and teaching one class per semester would help me get teaching experience.

(long story, grab some popcorn)",15,2,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/topt9/defamation_from_previous_academic_advisor_long/,"Using a throwaway account for this. I'm not sure if this is the best place to post. Kind of a long story / rant but here it is.

This past January I left a PhD program with an MS because of disagreements with my advisor. I started grad school in the fall of 09.
About a year ago, in Janurary 2011, I expressed discontent to my advisor with regards to the geographic location of the school.
I also asked if there was a way to move to a different branch of the school that had a location I preferred.
This effort on my part was met with support from my advisor but ultimately no solution was reached so I decided to tough it out.

At the end of the spring semester of 2011, I had finished my classes and began to work full time on research in the lab during the summer.
My research involved developing a method that could be used to base experiments on.
I had developed the method enough so that I could start using it in some experiments to extract useful data.
At around that time my advisor informed me that she had been invited to submit a paper to a journal and would like the paper to be based on my work.
She also told me that there were other projects she could base the paper on if my research didn't pan out.
I informed her that it was a possibility if I was able to obtain meaningful results with my method.
At this time we also submitted my work to be presented at a conference later that year in October.
I should note here that there wasn't a specific outcome we were looking or expecting other than some correlation with the variables our method allowed us to vary.
Basically I had not yet picked a hypothesis to test with my method and my advisor knew this.

I began to collect data using my developed method and searched for any meaningful trends.
While this was going on, the deadline for the paper drew closer and I had not yet found any meaningful trends worthy of publication.
My advisor requested and received an extension on the deadline of the paper.
The weekend before the paper was due, I had a slew of data that did not contain any obvious trends.
Luckily I was able to pull out a few meaningful trends to tell a story for the paper.
While writing, emails were exchanged and we butted heads on a few topics.
Most notably, I did not think we had a clear hypothesis despite having developed a novel method.
At several points while writing I asked for her input on data analysis, what I should be looking for, data presentation, etc.
Each time I was met with a response along the lines of ""you need to take ownership of your project, I cannot do it for you"".
In the end the paper was submitted, but not without some serious back and forth.
Eventually the paper was accepted but I really feel it could have been much better had it not been so rushed.
It could have been avoided had my advisor been willing to respectfully decline an invitation rather than saving face by putting it off on her student (me).

Later that summer, I decided I did not want to work for her based on what I had experienced and some extreme favoritism for specific students in the laboratory (among other things).
I brought it up that I didn't think she could put me on the right career path.
This was true after all because I didn't want to go into academia.
She however expresed a desire for her students to pursue academia over industry, which is not what I wanted to do.
Thus I suggested that I switch laboratories to work for someone else that could provide me with the proper guidance.
I interviewed with a few other PIs however none of them seemed to want me as a student despite a stellar academic record and strong research skills.
In the end I decided to complete an MS instead and leave at the end of the fall semester.

Remember that conference I submitted my work to?
Well it was accepted for a poster, but more on that later.

While I was interviewing with other laboratories, I continued my research in what capacity I was allowed to (there was no sense working on it if I was going to leave soon).
One week during lab meeting, we were interviewing a potential post-doc candidate, I reported that I had no new results to present because work was going slow.
Later that day (a Friday) I get an email from my adivsor asking to meet with her at 4:30pm.
I enter the office and am accused of making her look bad in front of a potential new lab member.
She says she is kicking me out of the lab and I need to move out of the lab offices.
She absolves me of any further obligations to the lab.
The main point she makes is that she needs me to leave so that she can still write a good recommendation for me later.
Mind you, two days prior I had completed the proof corrections for that invited paper. Talk about timing.

Then comes the conference.
She refuses to finance any part of my trip (no big deal, it's close by and I was awarded a travel grant to attend).
She asks me to send her a copy of the poster, which I do, so that another student can print it out.
Essentially what is happening is that she is afraid I will put up the poster and ""not properly represent the lab"".
A good point, but it is all my work, and I can better explain it than she can. It is also not in my best interest whatsoever to disparage the lab I did my work in.
We end up both standing at the poster for start of the session we're at but she later leaves to attend talks.
She suggests I leave too because there will be reduced traffic to the poster.
Not five minutes after she leaves, a professor from another (well-renowned) lab in the field comes by and I talk to him about my work (this gets me pumped!).
He asks what my plans are after the MS, suggests I apply to their program that fall, and tells me to call him when I apply.
I also find out he knows my undergrad advisor very well (bingo, another in with this guy).

Come the end of the semester, I get my MS and apply to the other school.
I figured it was worth a shot because I could just get a job in industry if it didn't work out.
In March I get a rejection letter. No big deal, I've got back up plans for a job and all I really lost was the application fee.
Then today I find out from a fellow (former) lab member that my advisor didn't exactly write a glowing recommendation as promised when I left.
Rather she wrote an ""honest"" pros and cons type of letter, according to my lab mate. Fair, but proves my advisor flat out lied to me.

End of rant.

There are other things, for example her trying to publish work with my method but moving my name to acknowledgements instead of an author if I don't approve a draft (I actually have written proof of this). She also hired that post-doc candidate which I apparently made her look bad in front of.

I could go on but you probably get the picture.

I should also add that I know 90% of the students in her lab are unhappy working for her but feel they are too far into their studies to back out without repurcussions.

I'm very concerned that this will negatively affect my current job prospects should they ask my graduate advisor for a reference. Is there any way to triage this?

Thanks for reading.

**TL;DR:** I took an MS to get out of a PhD program due to my advisor caring more about her reputation than the education of her students.
I believe she is unreasonably providing me with bad references based on our differences rather than my skills or abilities for a position.

I'm a candidate and nearing completion of my PhD (should be able to defend by Dec but will need to stick around for publication/reviews for a few months). I've been working on a project that is completely novel to the lab that spun off a collaboration. I've put about four years into it, developing a few techniques and refining protocols to build this from the ground up. We got a big grant to continue the work in my last year and after I'm gone. Was a huge surprise that it turned out this way to both my PI and I. 


But now I'm having issues with the person taking over my project. He's been here for about a year, rotated and then chose to stick with my work. At first, he helped me with certain aspects of my study. I taught him how to do immunofluorescence and qPCR and we were doing it together. Then he decided, since he knows how to do Westerns, to validate the qPCR with Westerns. That didn't work out so well because he could never isolate enough protein and the antibody wasn't as specific as the vendor claimed. After insisting for months that we needed Westerns and getting nowhere with it, he finally threw his hands up last December and moved onto his own subset of the project that I started but had to abandon to strengthen the core of the study.


Since this happened, things have been quite difficult. At first their focus was 50/50 for the main study and theirs. But it's dwindled to 0/100. Meanwhile, my boss is pushing for more and more from me and giving me very difficult deadlines. I could meet those deadlines if I had the other student's help, but he won't budge. He started skipping meetings and times to do work that we agreed upon. ""This isn't my study,"" he says, despite the fact that my boss puts him as second author on all conference abstracts and papers. At one point, I didn't come into work because I needed the morning to do laundry. He flipped out because I wasn't on hand to show him how to use some equipment to run an experiment I developed with code it took me weeks to write and refine. He never asked me if I was free at that time. Never said thanks for any of the help. Just a huge sense of entitlement.


His behavior got so bad that he let some cells die that he was supposed to culture for me while I was away at a conference. OK, no problem -- I restarted it and gave the responsibility to my undergrad for the next time I had to go off for a week to my collaborator's lab (in another state). He told the undergrad not to care about it and the cells died again. Meanwhile, this student's chosen project keeps hitting roadblock after roadblock and each time I feel more resentment coming from him. At one point, I made a stupid joke to my friend which he overheard (""Where's Clay St Pizza?"" ""Clay St."") and said he wanted to ""smack me"" for that. That was uncomfortable. He hasn't earned the right to joke with me like that.


I took this to my boss. I told him about his behavior and that I needed as much help as I could get to finish what needed to be done within his timeline. I told him that this other student's behavior was getting worse and worse and I didn't like my work environment anymore. And my PI was useless. He said that we're ""a team"" and that I don't have the authority to tell this student what to do. I explained that a second author has responsibilities. He said ""tell me if someone isn't doing something they're supposed to do."" How the fuck are they supposed to have to do something if no one with authority is telling them to do it and you just took my little bit of authority away??


I've been ignoring this student and my PI now. He asks for data, I tell him no it's not ready. He just has to deal with the fact that I'm one person and his refusal to manage the situation. As for the student, things are still very bad. He's now demanding I culture his cells for him while he's away on vacation. I will, because I'm not an asshole. But I feel like something needs to be done or said.


If anyone has been in a similar situation, I'd appreciate any advice you have. Otherwise, thanks for the opportunity to vent.

I just started a post-undergrad position at a top tier university. I was initially led to believe that the job was exactly what I was looking for -- in my area of interest, gaining the skills I wanted, and with the freedom to take classes/pursue my own research/volunteer in other labs. At my second interview, I was informed that a big part of the job was administrative with much less actual research than I initially thought, but still with some hands-on aspects and the freedom and resources to pursue other avenues of research/education in my free time. I started last week, and found out that this not really at all the case. The job is almost entirely technical/administrative with little to no involvement in the research, and I've been discouraged from seeking out the kind of opportunities I crave or have been told that that's not how things work here. I moved away from my family, my SO, and everyone I know for this job, and thus far it has just made me feel defeated and sad. 

I can't imagine doing this, period, let alone for a few years. I'm in my second week of training and I'm applying to other jobs already and looking for any opportunity I can to either have a job I like or live somewhere I'm happy, if not both. I'm not under any kind of contract for the job or for my house. My general plan as of now is to stick it out at least until Friday before making a decision, but I feel bad not talking to my boss (who hasn't been here since I started working) or the person training me about this. I don't want to waste their time by allowing them to be in the dark and train me if I have no intention of staying, but I feel like I can't say anything until I have made up my mind for sure.

I had a feeling that this was going to happen but I was staying positive about it, and I'm bummed that it seems to be turning out this way. During my second interview, everyone I met with told me they were surprised I had applied for the job at all seeing as how I have a strong research background, and some even went as far as to tell me I would be much happier doing more research (and they were right, although I didn't know how little I'd be involved with until I got here). I just didn't feel like I was in a place to turn down a well-paying job that's technically in my field at a university with such a good reputation, for grad school application purposes.

Essentially, I'm just looking for some words of wisdom. From anyone who has been in my position or who has felt similarly at some point, or anyone who has some light to shed on the situation. I feel like my inspiration and zest for life and passion for my field is being sucked out of me, and it's the worst feeling in the world.

I'll add a tl;dr at the bottom if you don't want to read my wall of text.

A bit of background: I'm 19 and have had moderate to severe depression and anxiety for the past 8 or 9 years. I've been in and out of counselling and had a brief stint of normalcy that lasted about a year and a half (ended this past autumn). That normalcy was brought about by me getting serious with my boyfriend who is my rock, and because of him I applied to go to university in England (I'm American, he's British) and we moved in together, and with my life looking so positive and happy all of the negative feelings faded. However, when I started my course, I became incredibly depressed. I realised I hated my course and talked to my advisor about switching out but it was too late in the year.

I managed to do alright (mentally) the first 4 months, but when I had a critique on my 3rd project that I was beyond proud of and the teachers hated it, I just snapped. My teachers had always humiliated me throughout the year, and I'd regularly leave the class to cry or take a breather, so I was just fed up. In February I stopped going to classes regularly. I went once a week, then once a fortnight, then once a month, and then we had all of April off and didn't go in during May at all. I spent the time lying in bed or moping about the flat. I missed my final portfolio review for my course, but I have 2 final exams for my other non-course-related subjects next week that I do plan on attending.

But back in September when I went to switch out of my course, I also realised I should apply to other universities for my new course. I've since heard back from all of them, and 3 out of 5 (2 rejections, not surprised) said that if I pass at a 60-65% for this year then I'm in. Unfortunately, I'm looking at a 40%. I talked to a few friends and my parents and they all suggested I write a letter explaining that I had a bad experience with the course and my depression and I was wondering if I could get the conditions relaxed a bit. The other 2 classes that I took that aren't related to my current course are related to the course I want to switch to, and I have a 70+ in those, so I hope I could use those as proof that I would do well in the new subject.

I've always been really embarrassed about my depression, and it's hard for me to put it into words. Anyway, how do I do this? Is this even a good idea? If there are any UK redditors, do you think this will help, or will they just toss my letter aside?

tl;dr: Finished my first year of uni in the UK as an American, but didn't get good marks due to depression/terrible experience. Applied to other unis, received conditionals that I can't achieve, want to write a letter explaining my situation, need general feedback if this is a good idea and what to include/leave out.

For the last two years, I was certain I wanted to go to grad school straight out of undergrad for a PhD in my field (humanities) and stay in academia for life, preferably as a professor.

This is my senior year, so I applied to four different schools' PhD programs. Today I was accepted to the one that is best in my field, with funding (probably about $17k per year, though I have yet to receive details).

The problem is, I'm not sure I want to do this anymore. I am in the running for a government job that would pay $42-50k to start and would allow me to have some precious free time to enjoy old hobbies that I gave up and maybe even pick up new ones. The job itself sounds like it'd be a nice stepping stone until I decide what to do next.

Before I got accepted today, I didn't think I'd get into grad school and I and my professors had really come to terms with that. I started seeing all the positives in working and all of the negatives in staying in academia. But now I feel like if I don't go get my PhD, everyone will be upset and disappointed in me, including maybe myself in the future.

This is basically how I'm seeing it:

JOB PROS
- Lots of money to live off of, start paying off loans
- Lots more free time, can do things I enjoy without feeling guilty about not reading/writing/researching all the time
- Won't have to pick up and move possibly all the way across the country in a few years just to get a job
- Ability to start a family when I want to without having to worry about career timing as much
- 9-5ish, won't always be working

JOB CONS
- Might lose its appeal after a while and I'll feel stuck
- Very structured schedule, which I tend to get tired of quickly

GRAD SCHOOL PROS
- Will be considered successful and everyone will be proud of me
- I do love my field a lot

GRAD SCHOOL CONS
- I'd have to buy a car in order to commute to the school, which would mean I'd be spending a lot more money on transportation than I do now
- No free time
- Only making just enough to live off of, no ability to save money, while interest accrues on undergrad loans
- After I finish, I may have to jump through lots of hoops to find a job, which might affect my family life or ability to start a family
- Professors never aren't working

I feel really stuck, and while I plan on talking to my professors, I know they will try to keep me in academia at all costs because they think I'm good at the field. And my parents completely don't understand any of this since they didn't even go to college, and are telling me I should go for the PhD without really understanding what that means other than getting to be called Dr.

I feel like my options are either to just go to grad school and leave after 2 years if I'm miserable or stick it out the full time and be a professor as original planned, turn down the offer and work full-time and decide later if I might want to reapply or even go into law or something instead, or see if I can defer admission and reevaluate in a year. I'm liking the defer option, but I'm worried that if I still don't want to go in a year I'll still just be disappointing everyone.

Anyway, any advice you can give would be awesome.

tl;dr: I can either get my PhD with funding or I can work straight out of undergrad. I'm not really sure if I want to stay in academia anymore but I feel kind of pressured to/like I should or I'll be a failure.

About two weeks ago, my diss adviser/doctoral committee chair called me out of the blue and dumped me. Her reasoning was that she was ""overwhelmed"" by her current teaching, advising and administrative responsibilities. Okay. Fine. She also said my co-chair had been made aware of the situation and would likely be willing to take over a primary advising role. Great!

Two well-crafted emails and two weeks later, I have still heard nothing from my co-chair. I'm beginning to think he's avoiding me because he doesn't want to do it.

My lack of adviser has caused me to stall out on my diss research and I'm spinning my wheels, losing precious time because I have no one to coach me through the conceptualization and development of my research (I'm currently revamping my proposal after a less than awesome first defense in December). There are also no other faculty members in my department who I think could effectively advise me other than former adviser and co-chair who is avoiding me.

I have no idea what to do here. Should I keep trying to contact adviser #2? Should I try to find someone else in the dept. willing to supervise? Any thoughts on the situation would be so very much appreciated.

TL;DR: I got dumped by my diss. adviser, my second choice is avoiding me and I don't know how to proceed.

**Update** I contacted my former adviser about my inability to reach my co-adviser to discuss him taking over and was basically scolded for not making enough effort to get in touch with him. Two trips to his office and two emails in two weeks seems to me like a good faith effort. This is so frustrating!

**Update #2**: I just got an email from my co-adviser asking to meet this week and visit about my situation. Finally! Apparently my former adviser CC'd him on her response to my email and it prompted him to reply. Much like some of you suspected, he said he has been completely swamped lately and was not, in fact, intentionally avoiding me which is good news. 

Thank you all for the thoughtful advice and words of support. I appreciate them very much.

Second, I want to ask him some questions about my current class. It was a class he recommended I take and there are a couple things that are tricky and I'm not quite understanding.

* I can publish the paper, presenting their finding as if we were the first to describe it. But it would be mean, as it would be scooping. So basically it's out of question.
* I can publish the paper with the finding, but mention it as a side-effect, pretending I did not notice it, and did not realize what it means.

My advisor said it was not a singular case, but I want to double check.  It seems pretty morally wrong, since the senior prof didn't even proofread the article, let alone contribute to it.

Thanks for the info, everyone!  Just a few clarifications:

I'm a PhD student thinking about quitting PhD, and getting out with a Master's degree, due to family commitments. 

More on my background: I'm 32, and my fiancee and I agreed to get married next year, and I'm pretty sure it will be difficult for me to finish PhD. Right now, I am burnt out and mentally exhausted. I often fantasize about getting out lately. I'm in my third year, already advanced to candidacy, in a PhD program at a UC campus.

My concern is about my adviser. She is an assistant professor who will get her tenure review next year. She only has two PhD students including me. If I leave, her research group will severely short-handed. Even now, we could not work on as many ideas as we want to. And I'm not sure what will happen to the her grant if I leave. I suppose we are sponsored by that grant.

My leaving ~~will~~ may jeopardize my adviser's career. I really don't want to. She's smart and caring. But I have to go.

My questions are:
1) From your perspective, what can I do to minimize my impact of leaving? How early should I tell her?
I made up my mind last weekend and I have not told her yet. I already had my Master's degree, and I can get out immediately. I'm thinking to stay another quarter to clean up everything I'm working on now. If I leave NOW, maybe my adviser can save some fund money from covering my tuition for another quarter. 

2) How should I tell her about leaving? 
I don't want to destroy our professional relationship. I have to say my productivity is declining lately when I was thinking about quitting, and this can be the last straw.

I have had no fun or interest in the classes and the research I have been producing. I do not think it is the classes I have picked but academia in general. I came straight as an undergraduate (5 yr) to PhD program (I majored in Women's and Gender Studies in UG and in a WGS graduate program).

I applied to a graduate program mostly out of fear that I will not be able to get a job solely with my undergraduate degree. I received a great 5 year package (and just finished my first year) but am dreading going back this coming year because it took so much out of me to pretend like I care.

This is my first post, and I wasn't sure which subreddit to post it to, but I hope this is the correct one. The questions are at the end; the information in the next paragraph is in case any of them needs context.

I have a masters in mathematics and a bachelors in engineering. About a year and a half ago, I ended an internship at Yahoo to study combinatorics(specifically, generating functions for doubly stochastic matrices). After this, I graduated, and took a year off to apply to colleges here in India(I had personal reasons for wishing to stay in the country). I slacked off during the first half, and did badly on tests; I gradually did better but bombed on the interviews. Looking back on my failures, I tried identifying problem areas, rigorizing my study, collecting materials and relearning, from the basics up. Taking a more patient look at things has revealed several areas that I am interested in studying deeper- complex analysis(analytic continuations, Riemann surfaces), combinatorial topology(polytopes, simplicial structures and triangulations), mathematical logic and set theory, algebraic topology, etc. A year ago, I was set on a PhD in combinatorics. Now, I'm not so sure. It isn't that I am not interested in combinatorics- I am; but I now have several other things I'm almost equally interested in(especially complex analysis). I am much more motivated and sure that I want to study mathematics rigorously and for a long time; I'm just adrift about where, how, and on what, to start.

And now, Questions:
1. Do you have to know what you want to do at the outset of applying to a PhD programme(as in, ""I want to work in the theory of partitions"")?
2. Is it a better idea, under these particular circumstances(inability to choose an area of interest for PhD+shifting interests) to (re)do an MS, followed by a PhD, given the situation?
3. As a foreign student applying abroad: what are the prospects(chance of admission+financial aid)of an integrated PhD(MS+PhD) compared with those for a PhD?
4. I have some conflicting information about mode of applying. Does one apply through a professor or directly to the institute? Is the         answer different for both(MS+PhD/PhD)programmes?(I realize this is country-dependent)
5. How important is prior research experience? My research experience is all over the place(and all but one in applied mathematics). Also, if I shift from combinatorics to (say)complex analysis, I have essentially no prior experience. Can this become a reason for disqualification?
6. As follow-up to 5: I have heard that a subject GRE(specific to the US, I think) might help offset some of the lack of research experience. Is this true?
 
Thanks in advance. Any other advice is appreciated. I don't really have a peer group I can ask these questions of, but I do need to ask them.",,False,,t5_2sakj,False,,,True,t3_1gyoy1,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/1gyoy1/questions_on_higher_education_in_pure_mathematics/,

As the title suggests, I am currently a Ph.D student in Electrical Engineering and I've been so for the last three years. While I have made some good progress during my time in the program (I've passed my qualifier and had one publication be submitted and published), my adviser has not been so impressed with me. Now, I won't say he is being unfair; I have unfortunately not been the most responsible student at certain times and there have been times when my work ethic has been questionable (my coursework is still strong though). These two traits of mine have gotten me fired from a previous grant and has damaged both me and my adviser's reputations at the University (this is bleak, uggh) in other scenarios. 

So, fast forward to now, my adviser has told me to take a break from the University for the summer and told me that if I came back in the fall that I would most likely have to find a new adviser but if I took a year or two off (and found a job in the industry) that he would strongly consider taking me back as a member of his lab. I am however writing my proposal during the summer and I am hoping that I might be able to impress him with it. But of course, there are no guarantees.

I still want to pursue a Ph.D and I have been told multiple times by my adviser and other colleagues that they think I am capable of doing so.

* I'm in my fifth year as a PhD student in the social sciences (have most of the dissertation data analysis done, written 2/5 chapters), looking for non-teaching work, in particular either institutional research or other education intervention/consulting.

* I've worked as a GSR on a couple different projects under 3 people during the last couple summers. Most of this work has been of the exploratory nature- go through these big data sets and work up a codebook and syntax, put out memos on what's interesting, and put together some models, draft up some pieces (intro, lit review, etc) for a paper.

* Out of these projects, one made it to conference and publication (I'm a co-author), and the others ended up not working out the way the PIs hypothesized so were either scrapped or folded into a different paper they are working on and have gone to conference that way. Also, for two of these PIs, I was devoting time to two or three different data sets at a time on different research questions.

How do I write these up? I've got headings with the dept. and PI's name (John Smith, PhD? Assistant Professor?) and the basic research topic. Beyond that, I'm not sure. For most of them, the duties were about the same. What should I include if nothing really significant came out of the project? What kind of format should I follow?

Secondly, should I include a listing for my own dissertation project and the project for my MA? I had previous experience doing background research (non stats, mostly policy write-ups) as an intern before grad school- should that be included as well?

http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2012/12/the-myth-of-self-correcting-science/266228/

&gt;For the uninitiated: post-hoc theorizing involves creating or revising a hypothesis after you've collected the data; data-fishing entails running a study, continually checking the data after each participant, and stopping as soon as you see a significant result. 


I don't know much about life science.  I've only looked at stats collected from computer programs, often concerned with stochastic optimization.

I've been looking at a bunch of simulation papers.  These are not classical Popperian ""state a hypothesis, collect data, calculate whether data rejects or fails to reject hypothesis.""

With these simulation papers, it's often the case that the writer will start with other folks' pre-existing algorithms, collect data on how well they run, and hack original algorithms until they are convinced the original algorithm is better than the pre-existing algorithms.  Then they collect data for their original algorithm and they often can get it published if their original algorithm is just a little better than the previously existent stuff.

Clearly they don't have a theory of their new algorithm until they've collected data on the old algorithms.  They don't care about whether their theories are post-hoc, so long as their algorithms are better.  Data-fishing might be pretty hard to do with stochastic optimization, because it requires many thousands of data points; one can't stop after 29 runs because the effect just got significant.

So apparently post-hoc theorizing is bad in the life sciences because it distorts the statistics somehow.  Why?  Why shouldn't one be proud to say, ""I measured the data first, and only then did I find out what hypotheses the data could reject""?  I imagine the problem is that the life sciences have very small sample sizes.  Perhaps they're working with statistics based on sixteen cancer patients instead of one thousand runs of a stochastic simulation.  If their sample sizes were really small, a little statistical generalization could make irrelevant hypotheses appear to be relevant.

I presume this kind of thing leads to some serious bad effect if one tolerates it in the life sciences, but I don't know what problems it causes.",,False,,t5_2sakj,False,,,True,t3_1581fn,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/1581fn/why_is_posthoc_theorizing_bad_for_life_science_is/,

I wasn't prepared, wasn't mature enough to handle it, and just killed my GPA one class at a time.

With the 6 drop policy in TX, I didn't realize I had reached my limit, and subsequently got F's in every class I ""dropped"" after the 6th one.  

I've taken some time off and done a lot of research to figure out once and for all what I really want. I've chosen a major that I'm really excited about (graphic design/advertising design), I'm in a great place in my personal life, and I'm ready to get back into school.

I took his graduate level class this past semester and he's amazing to interact with. The best thing about this position is that it will be a paid research position so I can drop my current job as a math tutor and focus on something that's incredibly intellectually stimulating (at least for me). 

The catch is that I have another research position that I've been at for 1.5 years.

I'll have a publication under my belt in this field (tissue engineering) by the time I graduate so it's been a worthwhile experience. 

Is having two research positions detrimental to my future prospects? I'm leaning more towards going to graduate school for polymers because I'm just as interested in it as biomedical engineering and it pays much much MUCH better once I get out with my PhD.

I'm in my first year in a science PhD program at a semi-prestigious institution and I'm currently thinking about re-applying to a different school. 

My two main reasons thinking about to switch:

1, I'm not connected to my advisor at all. I think his ideas are mostly not worth pursuing and I sense ""theoretical"" differences, what is important in the field etc.. It's not that bad at all, but It affects me as I can't go to conferences I would like and sometimes I have to participate in crappy projects. Not to mention that my thesis should be a co-work with my adviser.

2, I become aware that I'm more interested in a related but different field. I found myself reading papers in that area and looking for opportunities to interact with people from that area rather than my own. 

It might be possible to tweak my topic toward to my interest but then it became a one-man show(which I can pull out, it's just so much crap in the way). Also I have the feeling that I might miss out something very good with a more fitting environment/advisor. Of course the new option might just looks good from the outside, so the 'grass is always greener..' thing.

Apart from my adviser the environment is great, which I would be sad to loose for nothing: fantastic colleagues whom I had learnt a ton and very flexible working hours. Yes no free lunch, I'm just whining.

So what I would like to know:
- Have you had similar experience or heard about similar stories and how did they turn out?
- What is the usual practice on this shaky business by either parties? I wouldn't be overly content to read about an applicant who ""sneaks behind"" but I think I would kind of understand it. On the other hand I had heard stories when the contacted professor reported back to the adviser and the story had ended ungratefully..
- General feelings and thoughts?

I'm in a dilemma. I have been thinking about this for quite some time now, but haven't done anything about it because I don't know where to start, and so far have been afraid to ask for help.

I am a Junior in College, majoring in Physics, minoring in Math. I plan on going on to grad school. Probably get my masters and a teaching degree, but I would take a PhD program if I could get one. The thing is, my grades are shotty at best, and if I want to get into a good graduate program from what I have seen I would need a 3.0gpa just to be able to apply. My GPA was a 2.5, I have managed to get it up to a 2.6-2.7 overall.

I only have 3 more semesters here before I graduate (I am taking a 9th semester), and there is no way I can get my GPA above a 3.0 by then, even if I get 4.0s every semester. I am in a bind. How else can I get schools to look at me? I am the vice president of a club team at my University, I am inquiring about joining my University's Physics Club, I was a First Year Student mentor last semester (I taught a 1hr a week class of freshmen the ins and outs of college life). However, I don't feel like that is enough.

Lately my life has really been put into perspective, and I have gone from thinking about this, to realizing *Oh shit, I need to act on this!*

Is there any sort of advice that I can get on this? I am really stuck and don't know what to do, I want to get into something bigger than myself, but am not sure where or how to start. And the way I see it, the rest of my life rests on this.

The message I am getting from all of you is, try my best to get my grades up, but since I am doomed to have a GPA &lt;3.0 on graduation, I should try to put more emphasis on other things. Research will help me go far, and lucky for me my advisor in the Physics Department is actually the Physics department head, so I just sent him an e-mail asking to meet about my future.

Also I have seen a couple comments about scratching the PhD idea and just going for a master's and teacher's certification. This is probably the best idea, I would like to go into research, but I would still be happy being a high school teacher.

**Edit 2** Also, something that will help me, will be e-mailing departments that I am interested in getting into.

Believe me, nothing is more stressful on your career prospects than a decision like this especially if you are a woman who wants kids.

How can I solve my two-body problem without jeopardizing my own career?
 
About me and my job:    
I just started my postdoc, 5 year position in the DC-metro area (USA).  It's a fantastic job, the best institution for what I do, a very well-funded, and I have a generous institutional fellowship attached to my position.   This job is like a godsend to me professionally, as I did not have a productive PhD (for papers) and this lab is famous for producing at least a one Science and one Nature paper a year, first authored all by postdocs.  (I am an American citizen.)

About my partner and his job:    
My boyfriend is a Research Associate in Canada.  His job ends in December, but he may be able to extend it one more year.  He will likely go on the academic job market this fall for a tenure-track job. I would guess that he is amenable to getting a non-academic position as long as it pays pretty well (he partially supports his family back home) and he likes the work.  He is a citizen of Argentina and will likely be a permanent resident of Canada by the end of the year.

How we ended up in this pickle:   
He just wasn't sure he could stay where we were for more than a few months, so there was no point in me finding a postdoc there, particularly since it's not a very good area for what I do.   I was hoping he would go on the job market with me last year since he has been at his current job for a long and productive period already (five years total, first as a postdoc and now as an RA, he gets 3-5 papers a year).  That didn't work out.

He says he can't move to the US first and then find a job because he is not a citizen. He cant count on getting a job first, he says, because, it is very hard to find a job that will sponsor him for a visa.  He also says that faculty positions are so few and far between he can't be choosey where he moves if he gets a job offer.

I really can't wait five years to be together.  Even if it wasn't murder on me emotionally, the timing is terrible because I am in my 30s (he is 40) and I want to have kids some day, and there is no way I can be a mother here and work my 70-hour a week postdoc all by myself.

I am losing hope that we can be together.

I single-handedly wrote a summary article for the monthly periodical on a student survey that we distributed. The council said that all student council members should get their name on the article. I said no (and they said no to me adding an acknowledgement section), and after discussing it with the supervising ""adult"", I decided to leave. He reminded me that we were in a ""small community"" and that I should rethink my actions (i.e. Just give in and let everyone put their name on my independent work for the good of my future career). Following that conversation, I realized that I will never be able to work at this person's institution because I inadvertently blackballed myself.

Now I'm a bit depressed and wondering if I did the right thing. It really was all my own work, and even if you could argue that the council's chair should get their name on it, I don't see how EVERYONE should be an author just because they're a member.

Should I have given in? Does it maybe not matter in the grant scheme of things?

TLDR; I burnt a bridge with a professional colleague because I was too stubborn to share credit where credit wasn't due.

Edit: Looking through the previous issue of the periodical, I see an article written by a committee member. He is the sole author, even though (I asked him) other people weighed in on the content, and he was invited to write the opinion piece by the current organization's chair. I see this as pretty parallel. If he doesn't have to include the inviting chair's name or the names of people he bounced ideas off of, why do I?

I have gone from one postdoc to another, but am working on the same projects (these projects were a collaboration between Boss #1 (just left this lab) and Boss #2 (current)).  The facilities where Boss #2 is (and I am now as well) are much better than where I was with Boss #1, and I have redone all my experiments here with much better results. 

While I was with Boss #1 the work kept getting stalled because the data was so problematic.  Boss #1's attitude was ""just make the best of it, write the paper(s) and don't look back.""   But I continued to struggle because I felt I could not come to firm conclusion (one that believed) with such sketchy data.  (The poor quality of this data has been independently confirmed).  This eventually lead to me leaving the lab, but on pretty good terms.  

The issue is with the papers I am now writing from these two projects.  Boss #1 insists on being final author because he invested so much in the original (poor) experiments.  I am not using any of that data, and Boss #2 did pay for these experiments.  I feel Boss #2 should be senior author.  I could perhaps negotiate a co-last authorship, but I have to say, I feel I can't make a good case to Boss #2 when I did all the work in his lab and on his dime.  Also, I am eager to have Boss #2 think well of me, as I just started a few months ago want to make a good impression (he is probably the most famous person in my small area of the field, Boss #1 is much more peripheral).

Any advice on how to handle this issue is appreciated.

**TL;DR** - Writing papers now, based on work started in one lab, but started again and completed in my current lab.  Both PIs (old and new) expect to be sole senior author, oy vey.

*Side note, possibly relevant*
While I was a postdoc with Boss #1 I was part of several multi-author projects, but have given him no first author papers from me.  But, part of the reason I could not be independently productive is that I was his unofficial grant-writer in the lab.  I wrote half of one and all of the second (an R01) of two grants that funded all the work while I was in that lab (not to mention countless other grants that didn't get funded).  The R01 was based on my own work, not what was done in Boss #1's lab.  Also, I do have another paper with Boss #1 which also shouldn't go with him as senior author, but I know the other person doesn't care at all.

I generally just try to be supportive and encouraging because I know that she really wants it. And that's the thing with graduate degrees (meaning Ph.D.) right?

I read all the comments and really took them to heart. I've been meditating on them and on the deeper questions I've been forced to ask myself. Thank you all for your words of encouragement and for reminding me that I'm doing this all for myself.

Throughout my Master's program, I had constant ""up""s and ""down""s regarding the ""Am I good enough?"" question. For most of my 1st year as a PhD student, I've felt mostly ""down"" about it all. There are many factors which were influencing that -- the biggest one being that my partner and I are geographically separated by my PhD aspirations. I never really appreciated how much I rely on him to get me through the rough days. 

Case in point, he recently sent this lovely e-mail which still makes my eyes water:
&gt;I'm so proud of you chasing after what you want with getting your
doctorate.  I know you've been doubting if you really want it, but I'm
proud to see you doing something you like with people you like.  Even
if you choose not to pursue the doctorate, I'll still be proud of you
as long as you are doing what you love, and of course, I'll always
love you.


When I think about how I respond to the ""Am I good enough?"" question, I definitely respond in one of the two ways mentioned in in_question's comment:
&gt; in my experience, once someone starts getting the feeling that they should leave, one of two things happens, they either start doing much better work to justify their presence, or their work starts slacking. look at your work, if yours is getting better, stay, if not, leave. think of it as your subconscious telling you what to do.

If I feel like I'm not good enough, I throw myself into my work and education. Granted, I've been avoiding some aspects of the research because of a fear of failing, but I don't think that will always keep me away from my obligations. 

Maybe I'm just in an ""up"" moment, but I'll stick with this program. I know everyone goes through moments of doubt, and I'm glad this community was here to listen and respond to mine.

Particularly within ancient history and related fields.,10,1,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/1k99en/is_there_scope_in_academia_for_frenchenglish/,"This question is somewhat self-serving, though one that I'd really love to get an idea on.

What I'm referring to is the scope for translations from French into English for:

* Graduates, post-grads, professors, and all others actively engaged in research who would like access to francophone works and do not yet have an appropriate reading level in French.

* Francophone academics who would like to translate their research into English in order to broaden their readership reach.

* Translations done outside of publishing houses, who dictate which works are translated and who use in-house translators.

I graduated with a B.Arts with majors in French and classical languages at the end of 2012 and I have been exploring the opportunities available for a career as a French to English translator, catering for those who fall under the first two bullet points.  Primarily I am focusing on research within Classics, history, ancient history, archaeology, and all related fields.  What I have found is that translations outside of publishing houses are done, if at all, through a colleague of friend if the researcher/author happens to know someone who is available at the time.  Remuneration is generally small or non-existent.  

Many academics in those fields do have an adequate reading level in French, which drives down the requirement for French-English translations.  Publishers are therefore happy to publish in languages other than English.  I do wonder though how many people are affected by that; are there francophone authors who find it difficult to have articles accepted by major publishers, and are subsequently limited in the number of smaller publications who publish only in English?  Are there researches who regularly come across a wonderful piece of research in French, though circumstance doesn't allow timely access to an English translation?  I would love to fill that void, if the demand was out there, and I am sure there are many others like me.  To date, response to my inquiries have been lukewarm or non-existent.  Perhaps there is no demand, or perhaps I have not inquired with the correct people.  Perhaps even it is the specific fields I am looking into that do not require such translations, though other fields have a more pressing need.

Would you fine people have experiences where you could have used this service, or have had colleagues find themselves wishing for the opportunity for an English translation of a French work?




Additionally:  

* I have explored avenues with publishers; work with them is similar to any other employment opportunity - one must be the right person at the right time for the right role.

* For researchers, a consideration when obtaining a translation is the copyright.  What I envisage is that if one is willing to pay for a translation, then I as the translator would act as a middleman.  An enquiry would be made to the author, asking for permission.  The author would essentially have their work translated at no cost to themselves, and retain all copyright.  Hopefully this is a win-win situation for the author and permission would not be difficult to receive.",,False,,t5_2sakj,False,,,True,t3_1k99en,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/1k99en/is_there_scope_in_academia_for_frenchenglish/,

I started my PhD in October 2011 and it seems to have been going quite well so far (some nice results and got some papers published in our research group).

I had a meeting with my supervisors this morning and they told me that I should aim to submit around June next year. This was a pleasant surprise to me (I was thinking more like December 2014) but it's also kind of freaked me out that I've only got one more year remaining.

So what should I do/plan for this coming year? I've currently got a draft table of contents for my thesis and have my lit review from my transfer report that I'll expand. I've got some results still to prove but think that shouldn't be an issue before next year. 

The thing that really worries me is what to do post-PhD. To be honest, I still don't really know what I want to do as a career - I think I want to go into industry rather than academia but I'm not sure. How do people balance finishing up with getting a job? My advisor keeps suggesting postdocs, some of which have application dates of October/November 2013... Do I want to be applying for industry jobs at the same time?

**tl;dr** - Basically, I'm just a little nervous about entering my final year of PhD - any advice or tips would be hugely appreciated!

When I was an undergraduate, I studied both mathematics and musicology, getting bachelor's in both and a master's in the former. However, I would not like to be either a mathematician or a musicologist, so for my PhD a certain switch has to be made.

For academics in the sciences: Part of the reason I studied mathematics was to develop skill in the mathematical sciences. My research area for my master's degree was in Fourier analysis and signal processing, two important fields for the sciences. I would love to study cognition or computational linguistics for my PhD, although everyone I speak to says that I'll be barred from these fields because I have no lab experience. However, so far no lab has accepted me even as a volunteer because I don't have formal experience in cognitive science or psychology. Even if the lab said its focus is in mathematical modeling or coding, I still found no luck. I do have functional knowledge in cognitive science, although this doesn't seem to be enough. What's a mathematician interested in the sciences to do?

For historians: I also have a degree in musicology with a focus in music history. I did a bit of research here as well, a bit of cultural history. My senior thesis on modernism was very well received and earned me a number of awards. My question for historians his this: how attractive will I be to a regular history program? I have quite a solid knowledge of history and politics and I'd prefer to study a field other than music or cultural history. What would I need to do to, say, look attractive to a program in general history?

I don't know if this is relevant information, but I did do quite well in school. My grades were good, I was inducted into Phi Beta Kappa and I have some awards to my name. Will these help my case? Also, if it helps, I would like to be an academic one day, so industry is not for me. 

Thanks.

I have had 5 research positions (by the end of this summer) as well as spending 8 months in industry working for an information systems company. Two of my research projects were in Atomic, Molecular and Optical (AMO) Physics, which went well, but which I did not really enjoy. I did, however, very much enjoy working in the information industry, mostly on computer vision techniques for satellite imagery. Due to my unhappiness with the AMO Physics, I decided that this was a calling to start pursuing computer science, and so decided to obtain a minor before graduating.

I then took a course in Computational Neuroscience, and it was amazing! I have always had a passion for neuroscience, although this is the only course I have taken on the subject. This summer I am working on Natural Language Processing in an attempt to get some experience closer to the subject, as there are no researchers at my university who are working in the field.

I have very good grades, excellent letters of recommendation (for Physics, and I should have very good ones for Computer Science from this summer), and a few ideas of specific research in the field which I want to pursue. I am really passionate about research, but I'm becoming increasingly worried about my prospects.

When applying to graduate school, if you attended several schools, do you enter the cumulative GPA (as listed on the transcript as cumulative) from the school that you earned your degree or do you manually add up grades from different schools?

With respect to fellowships/financial assistance, does this same rule apply?

Reason for asking:
My graduate admissions office stated to list my cumulative GPA from the school I graduated from. This seems opposite to what I interpret *cumulative* to mean and I would like to confirm or refute this point. 


Back-story: 
Since high school (2005), I have taken classes for college credit. Over the next 8 years, I transferred two times, switched majors, and 'took time off' while going to a community college. I have double the credits needed to graduate. With that in mind, I performed poorly at the institutions that I attended previously. Thankfully, I was able to excel at my current university. Since my GPA will drop dramatically, below the 3.5 requirement for most funding, how are students evaluated in this situation?

I understand that admissions committees evaluate in different ways, however, any insight will be greatly appreciated.

Having a crisis of self so any and all input would be amazing.,12,3,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/1hxqv5/should_i_pursue_my_mfa_in_screenwriting_having_a/,"I graduated from a film school on the east coast with a degree in screenwriting three years ago but am not a working screenwriter. I've held related jobs and am currently a producer at a small production company in NY state. I do well in academic settings, and they usually help push me to the next level in whatever I'm doing. Since graduating I've been floating around, just trying to pay the bills, and I want to a) get to Los Angeles and b) advance my craft. 

MFAs in screenwriting are EXTREMELY unnecessary. There are many working screenwriters who have them, and many who didn't even go to undergrad. If I were to pursue this it would be purely to advance my craft, meet new people to collaborate with, and help get me situated on the other side of the country. The cons are obviously the money and loans. I'm already in debt from my undergrad, and while there are grants and financial aide, it's still overwhelming. I also am worried that I'll be stalling my career for another two years when I could be out there trying to work my way up. An MFA in screenwriting won't automatically get me a job. It will improve my work which could help me get a job, but in the film/tv industry it's really about who you know, the timing, and lastly your work. 

I feel so stuck in life right now, however, and like I said I do well in school and enjoy it. It could be the right move for me, but I'm conflicted. I don't want to waste money on application fees if ultimately it's a stupid decision. I'm looking at USC, UCLA, Loyola Marymount, and UT Austin (because I'm dying to live in Texas).

1373323097.0,8,self.AskAcademia,1hw8ji,Should I stay in my PhD lab for a 1 year post doc?,10,2,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/1hw8ji/should_i_stay_in_my_phd_lab_for_a_1_year_post_doc/,"I did a 4 year undergrad and have now just defended a 6 year molecular biology/genetics PhD at the same university (different departments, if that matters).  During my PhD project I started a little bit down a new direction that I was very interested in (bioinformatics related), but because it didn't really fit with my main project I wasn't able to pursue it.  I also submitted a paper just before defending that now requires some revisions.  My original plan was to stay in the same lab for several months (6 at the most) to revise and resubmit the paper, work on this new side/mini project and maybe get a small paper out of it, all while looking for a post doc position.  My supervisor was ok with this but it was partly contingent on funding.

Now my supervisor has been given funding specifically to hire a post doc.  The problem is that it can't be used to hire someone for just 6 months (for administrative or union reasons, or something).  She has offered to hire for me for a full year, probably 2 if I wanted it.  The benefits of me staying for a year:

* I would have a job for a year, and I don't have anything else lined up right now.  I wouldn't end up homeless on the street without an immediate job but I might have to...move back in with my parents or something, depending how long it took to find a new job.  I also think it is easier to find a new job while you have a current one rather than while you're unemployed.

* Get to work in an area of research that I've wanted to for the past two years or so but haven't been able to.  One of the main things I was looking forward to after actually finishing my PhD was to do this work so I'd be kind of disappointed to have to pass up that opportunity.  I will also have the opportunity to learn new techniques that I think will help me get future positions doing research I'm interested in.

* Between my current paper revisions and the new work, get two more publications (a first author and probably a co-first or second author).  Given that I only have one first author and one co-first author publication so far, in decent but not top journals, and they are both from &gt;2 years ago, I think getting more publications is very important for me when looking for future jobs.

* Some personal reasons, but for the sake of my future career these will have to be secondary.

The drawbacks of staying for another year:

* It will (might?) look bad that I've spent so much time at the same university, and in the same lab.

I don't know what my long term goal is.  I love science, I like research, in particular this new area I could pursue, but I'm pretty sure I don't want to be a professor.  From a practical standpoint of having a job and making a decent living I'm also open to working in industry, but I prefer the idea of being able to research things more based on what you are interested in rather than what you can just make money off of, so I'm pretty sure I don't want to move to industry just yet.  If I stayed here for a year the next position I would look for would be a standard 1-2 year post doc at a different institution.

So I am trying to weigh the benefits and drawbacks (I guess just one drawback, really).  Am I really going to be committing 'career suicide' if I stay here another year, or do the benefits balance this out?  I want to say yes, and stay, and this is the only thing I am worried about.  I don't know what would happen if I agree to the 1 year then decide to leave in say, 8 months, if I find another job.  I don't know if I should even ask about this, since it would look like I'm not committed to staying.

**TL:DR Should I do a 1 year post doc in my current PhD lab?  I would have the opportunity to get more publications, pursue an area of research I am very interested in, and learn valuable new skills.  On the other hand, I did my undergrad at the same school so spending another year here may look bad.**",,False,,t5_2sakj,1373324922.0,,,True,t3_1hw8ji,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/1hw8ji/should_i_stay_in_my_phd_lab_for_a_1_year_post_doc/,

My other alternative is to go to University of North Florida, which is much closer to home and at which I would certainly get in. At this school, though less prestigious, the class sizes are smaller and I could definitely be more involved.

I feel like I would do better at UNF although UF carries more prestige and more resources (bigger). However, my end game is a PhD. So my biggest question is this:

For whatever reason, on the campus where I work there are very few young PIs (maybe 3 out of about 50), and of the young ones none of them are women.  I would love to have a young PI to talk with and discuss the challenges and joys if early career life.  There are actually only four women PIs total and they are all over 50.  Similarly, there are no late-stage postdocs who are women or who want research careers.  

My advisor is very well-meaning, but he has had tenure so long that I don't think he is in touch with what young scientists deal with for the job market and preparing for it.  For example, he is very down on the idea of me applying for grants or going to conferences, saying publications are all that matters.  I feel like, these days, you have to write grants AND papers and be visible at conferences.  He actually never looked for a faculty position, as he was tapped during is postdoc at this lab for his current job.

He also has a rather old-fashioned idea of how one should work - i.e. have a wife who takes care of your domestic life so you are free to pursue your work and relaxing hobbies at will.  He is always encouraging me to eat hot lunches and take-up sports like he does, to be more happy and productive.  I see this as very sweet, but I don't have a wife like he does to pack me a nice lunch every day. I go to the gym when I can but I spend most of my non-work time doing laundry, grocery shopping, a little cooking, housecleaning, running errands, fixing things, and reminding my partner that i exist and that I know he does, too.  And I think this is pretty standard for scientists of my generation and career stage.

OK, now that I am done venting about that, let's work on the solution.  There isn't anyone for me to tap into here, but there is another campus of the same institution not far away and I am sure there must be someone there who isn't 10+ years into tenure who might like to have a cup of coffee with me.  Any tips on how to find this person?

I stumbled across a physics graduate program while I was looking at potential schools in the fall. It sounded interesting so I decided to fire off an application. Well, I was accepted and invited to the recruitment weekend. After attending a few weeks ago I have been feeling more and more apprehensive about accepting the offer. 

It turns out this program is the best in the country, if not the world, for studying this subject, and is very difficult to get in to. The other prospective students at the recruitment weekend had been preparing to study in the field their whole undergraduate career. I have a BS in physics but my research has been in another area (this one was not available to study at my school). I try to read papers on the subject but over 50% of it is jibberish to me right now.

I honestly have no idea how I was accepted to this program, and feel like I don't deserve it. On one hand, my acceptance still stands and I would love to jump at the opportunity. I don't mind putting in the time and effort it will take. On the other hand, am worried I might not have the mental capacity for the work. 

Is it OK for me to give it my best shot with this school? Or am I setting myself up for failure and stealing a spot from a more qualified student? My other option is another program at a different school, in an area I am more familiar with. However, I am not as interested with it, and it will be much more expensive for me to attend.

I recently discovered my love for biology a year ago while completing my AA. I took a biology course on a whim just to satisfy a science credit. This class changed my life completely; studying habits to the way i viewed the world. i know it sounds cheesy, but i feel like life has a more meaning now. I ended up taking Bio II to confirm that this wasn't a phase, and yet the fire still burned. I'm now attending a University to pursue a degree in Biology- one problem off the bat i'm a late bloomer and I have an extremely weak background in math. I took basic classes for my AA up to statistics, but i'm at a complete loss when it comes to CALC. I can't really take any upper level courses towards my degree until i complete my math requirements, seeing as they are prerequisites for courses like physics. Staying optimistic, this spring term i started out enrolled in chemistryI and precalc. i was virtually teaching myself everything, i woke up and went to sleep 
doing precalc. I wanted to do this more than anything. I needed to prove to myself that i can learn math. it became a personal goal. i've always talked down about myself possibly having learning abilities and 
here was my chance to defeat that demon. Unfortunately, This past month took a complete 180. I lost my grandmother the first week of class, which lead to me having to take time out of school (a few days too many from precalc), and on my way back home i had my first panic attack while on the air plane. I continued to stick it out and tried keeping up. It was tough, but for a good 2 weeks i felt better than ever, i was actually understanding and on a path to somewhere. Another set back arose when i had another panic attack while driving, which lead to to the ER. i've been experiencing them everyday since then. i'm afraid to drive now and i've been busing it to class (hr ride). the worst part is i had to dropmy precalc class because of this mess. I just couldn't get back with all that anxiety. I feel so defeated. If i continue to pursue this major i wont graduate until about 3 years or maybe more. Any thoughts about me getting a private tutor and studying everything i'll need to know up until Calc and just testing into CalculusI to get the ball rolling? i'm talking blood sweat and tears type of studying. I'll have till Fall. It's not a matter of finishing quickly. I just really want to get involved in this major already. my interests are in ecology, but who knows, the field is so large i'm not trying to limit myself. 

this is a terrible post, i apologize for my ramblings. i'm just very discouraged right now. I'm feeling like i should switch my major, I don't want to, but i feel like i'm not competent enough in the mathematics departnent. i'm only 21, but i exhausted plenty of majors (music ed, elementary ed, etc..), none of which i felt this strongly about. reddit, do you think i should revaluate my choice in major? should i get a tutor while i'm only taking one class and test into calc? has anyone else experienced a discouragement in degree choice because of college level math courses being too difficult?

Not sure if everyone [remembers this AskAcademia post](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/12alkf/being_screwed_by_a_professor/) I made a little while back but it received a lot of sympathy and advice from everyone. The girlfriend was naturally apprehensive from using any assistance gleamed from the internet but did take the general message of ""FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT"" to heart. And she did so in her own way. She went to the professor first (after sending him emails and got the turn around along with a subtle 'too bad') and laid her case. The professor actually relented and sent her an email saying that it must have been an error on the publication side and asked the publication to fix it. The editor was based in NY and was hampered by Hurricane Sandy for a week and never really responded to any email from her. Eventually the gf got annoyed enough and called him. After a *very* lengthy phone call he basically stated that there was nothing they could do and that since it was already published online that the offline magazine had to reflect the same thing. NO FIX CAN BE MADE. **(cough) bullshit (cough)** However they would be happy to put in the next release a correction of authorship, assuming her professor also okay'ed it since his name was the current primary author. We already had emails from him to the editor saying that this could be authorized, so it was no problem. The GF wisely asked that all this information be sent her to email (so that we can have a paper trail).

I'm not some whiny youngster who thinks I'm getting too much work from my profs. In fact, I see my coursework as good preparation for a rugged grad school program. 

The reason I'm asking this question: for this semester (15 credits), it seems that my profs are giving me an extraordinary amount of reading and course work (class presentations, papers, essays, current event assignments, etc.). I've been barely keeping up - it feels much like the familiar cartoon scene where water-squirting holes start showing up on a wall and a character is trying to plug every new hole before eventually becoming overwhelmed by endless new holes.

I'm not sure if there's something wrong with my study skills and time management (regardless if there indeed is, I always look to improve them) or I *am* getting an unrealistic amount of assignments.

If you're a professor, I welcome your input. What I'm experiencing this semester got me curious whether studies have been done on how much course work is ""reasonable"" (I know the confounding factor is how much work students are getting from other classes). How much reading you usually give per week for a non-introductory (300 or 400 level) class as well as written assignments per semester? Sharing additional observations very welcome.

So, now I'm wondering. Should I reply and say something along the lines of ""thanks for letting me know, I hope the class goes well, etc"" or not? Is that kind of spamming his inbox? I know profs get hundreds of emails a day.

Quick background:

* I graduated with a BA in chemistry from Brown this May, but I have very broad fundamentals in philosophy, religious studies, Chinese language, and cognitive science. 
* I took classes through several other universities due to an illness my freshman year, but in the end across all schools my GPA is something like a 3.2. Not terrible.
* I was involved in research, once for a class and once as an assistant.  Neither ended in any publication with my name on it, and as an assistant I accomplished basically nothing. A combination of a really terrible graduate student mentor and my lack of proactivity/knowledge about how to politely handle the situation.
* Very little relationship with professors, so little opportunity to obtain good recommendations.

My goal:

I want be accepted to a strong graduate school for cognitive science, psychopharmaceuticals, and/or philosophy. However, I'm currently employed full-time as an IT consultant, with which I am dissatisfied. 

Ideally, I'd like to apply for schools starting Fall '13 or Spring '14, but I am very very very concerned my research and recommendation limitations are a problem. I need to continue working for at least a year to make sure I'm financially comfortable (eg loans are mostly gone) and to develop some of the poor communication skills/shyness that really hampered my undergraduate research career.

I'm looking for any and all suggestions to get from where I am presently to acceptance into a strong PhD program (Chemistry at UC Berkeley being #1, but possibly beyond grasp). 

My present considerations:

* I live in Chicago and have been considering trying to contact chemistry departments at U Chicago, U of I Chicago, and Northwestern and see if they can take a part-time volunteer lab tech. Is this a typical/likely solution to padding my research resume and sources for recommendations (not to mention research is awesome!)?
* My other solution might be to apply to a less ambitious school (ex, U Hawaii Manoa), and then after a couple years attempt to move to a school with better resources and reputation; I know I'd likely spend a couple extra years in school, but that's almost a plus :p

Finally, I'm not concerned at the moment with moving from PhD to professorship--I'm aware that's far from guaranteed, but that's a problem for another day.

Option 1:  Finish with classes and work solely on research.

Option 2:  While working on research pursue a graduate minor or co-major in a related field such as bioinformatics, neuroscience, molecular biology etc.

Option 3:  While working on research pursue an unrelated minor in business or a graduate certificate in entrepreneurship/innovation.

Option 4:  While working on research attempt to pursue an MBA part time(not sure of the details on how this would work).

I come here for advice since I would like to hear from you folks on the real world value of some of these options such as a co-major, graduate minor in related fields, unrelated fields, certificates etc.  The business areas would really only be useful in industry.

By the way, I am in academic lab research (science).

So which one do I choose? These are both at the same academic institution.

1) research I am interested in with a new lab; position stable only for a couple years until grant money runs out; probably only one published paper coming out of here; novel research, if successful will be funded extensively; since it's a new lab, I WILL BE THE ONLY RESEARCH ASSOCIATE until I get everything set up

2) research I'm not too interested in but in an established lab; position stable forever as its paid for through the institution (not grants); potentially four published papers coming out of here (4 high profile PIs); research not so ground-breaking, but stable

What's more important in terms of marketability in the long term in the sciences? Sheer number of published papers or the substance of papers? And do I choose the stable career or the more risky one? And  would a PI who interacts with me daily be better than four higher profile PIs I hardly interact with?
Please help! 

I can also give advice on how I landed these jobs without too much experience. I did not network at all for these offers. I did it the old fashioned way of sending in my apps/resumes and going into interviews. Any questions welcomed!
Thanks!

edit: I still have to go through HR red-tape before getting the final job offers. But I have received verbal offers from both saying the job is mine after my paperwork clears.

So I ask you, what are the benefits of pursuing a PhD/MD? What are the negative factors? Do you eventually have to chose one focus over the other? Postdoctoral work and residency: do you choose one over the other to do first? Does the order matter? Does your work after completing PhD/MD synthesize training you received for the different fields? Do you receive funding more easily as a Phd/MD? are there an increased number of funding sources? And above all, is the time commitment worth it?

As in, not just grade and lecture, but actually develop lesson plans, be a resource for students etc. I enjoy keeping up with the field (I've been to several conferences and loved them) and wouldn't mind doing some research, but I want to focus on teaching at a high level.

EDIT: I should probably add that I like school, so spending a few extra years as a grad student doesn't feel like a burden so much as an opportunity.

EDIT2: Wow thanks for all the great responses everyone!
Good to know about focusing on research for the applications. Also, I am not as much interested in educations learning or degrees so much as having the opportunity teach. As for teaching K-12 I don't mind it, and have actually considered doing programs like [MFA](http://www.mathforamerica.org/home) before going to grad school (any input on how this looks on applications?) but it is definitely not a long term career goal.

(MA vs. PhD, research interests, funding issues, etc.)",10,2,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/1jq0ee/applying_to_frenchcomparative_lit_programs_advice/,"Hello, I vaguely remember someone in r/gradschool posting a question regarding French graduate-level programs, so I was hoping that there would be a few more posters with backgrounds in the humanities that could offer some advice (hopefully this is the right place for these sorts of questions)…

In case a bit of background would help: I’m starting my last year of undergrad in two weeks or so, and will be graduating with a dual degree in English Lit. (concentration in Brit. Lit.) and French. I’m almost certain that I don’t want to pursue a PhD - I can’t help but wonder whether I’m simply not motivated enough, but for various reasons (social anxiety, etc.) the prospect of teaching, at any level really, terrifies me, and I’ve essentially ruled out taking a year off to teach English in France through a French government-sponsored program. 

I do want to at least go through with an MA in French literature or comparative literature (likely the former).  I'm very much aware that you shouldn't apply to grad school simply because you feel it's the next logical step after so many years of schooling or because you have no idea what else to do, and that you should have relatively clear goals in applying…so I was hoping that someone might have advice regarding a few things:

1. When applying to an MA program (as opposed to a PhD program), how important is it that the faculty have specialized knowledge (publications, certain genres/writers/movements are listed under their research interests on the department website) in my areas of interest? 

2. Related to #1, how specific should my statement of purpose be in mentioning potential research interests, knowledge of specific works, etc.? At the moment I really only have a few very broad topics and authors that I feel drawn to but that I definitely don’t feel that I have a mastery of…in case anyone cares/wants to offer a critique: the fantastic and the absurd, decadence (e.g. Huysmans, though I haven’t read La-bas/novels where the occult features prominently), surrealism both in the 1920’s/1930’s and in contemporary literature (in particular, Roland Topor) and representations of violence in the theater and in modern/contemporary French lit. I guess I’m asking because I really don’t think it would help to wait another year before applying, and was hoping that over the school year and the following summer I’d be able to further develop my knowledge in the subjects that I’d expressed an interest in throughout my SOP.

3. After reading a bunch of posts on gradcafe, it seems as though MA students rarely get funding, especially in the humanities…I imagine it’d be much more difficult to apply directly to PhD programs, but would it make sense to apply to both MA and PhD programs with the intention, in the case of the latter, of quitting after two years with an MA?

4. For a foreign-language program, should I only be asking for letters of recommendation from (in my case, French) language professors? I ask because I only have one substantial paper written in an upper-level French literature course taken here in the U.S., and that was over a year ago (I spent all of last year studying in France, and I don’t think I can get recommendations from professors there)…meanwhile, the only professor who I feel would be able to write me a relatively detailed letter of recommendation teaches Russian literature… :/

Thanks so much for anyone who read this/feels like they have any insight…I don’t have anyone to discuss all of this with and am starting to panic a bit, so really, anything helps… :/

I'm about to start a PhD program in political science at a mid-ranked (though rising) university department with some exciting professors. I'm looking forward to it, as the whole process sounds exciting. I'm in my 30s, and have held a lot of jobs, and I see the PhD process as such: a job that I have to devote my time to. At the same time, it seems like the first job that I can truly feel motivated by.

Now, the question: I'm worried about job prospects after the PhD program. I'm funded, at least past the Masters degree stage, but five years (or so) seems like a lot of time to invest if the job situation is going to be so incredibly terrible, as many people seem to say.

My question: when people say jobs are scarce, that it's almost impossible to find anything, is that true? I mean, I understand that it is hard to find TT positions, but honestly, I really would be happy teaching at an SLAC or something like that making, say, $40k yearly. It would be harder to put too much time to research, though of course I'd continue doing that, but I also really like the prospect of teaching at a lower-level school, where I would maybe be able to inspire some students who might be poorer, who might have had some problems in the past, the way some great professors inspired me to actually go on. Are these jobs so impossible to find, too, or is it mainly the R1 TT jobs that are? I mean, I've seen people post things like, ""There are no jobs; you'll end up teaching at some SLAC for $40k.""

I am beginning my grad program in the fall and am seeking advice on how to choose an advisor, specifically if I should be concerned about their previous students/publication records. 

For the topics I’m interested in, the professors are relatively new and don’t have many graduated students. There are a few older professors in the department who probably have more wisdom in the topic and experience with advising students. But, the professors I’m most interested in in terms of research topic, are both newer and have about 2 phd students graduated each. 

So here’s where I am left speculating (please bear with me, I sincerely don’t mean to offend anyone with these generalizations…): I’ve been told that older professors usually don’t have as much of an interest in the student since they already have tenure. They have more experience, but sometimes it’s “older information” compared to newer faculty. On the other hand, newer professors have much more of an interest in your performance because it has more of an effect on them. However, newer advisors are supposedly higher risk – I’ve heard stories of worst case scenarios where the professor leaves and the students are left stranded. 

What are your experiences with newer vs. older advisors? Are there other pros/cons that should be considered? Should I be concerned about their student/publication tracks, or would it be better for me to more heavily weight personality/research interests in my decision? How can I get an accurate representation of their advising style (is it acceptable to directly ask grad students?)?

Thanks in advance!

However, since graduating, my interests have shifted (or maybe I've become more aware since being exposed to the 'real world'?) and would like to pursue something outside my undergrad education. I've always been fascinated by engineering; I like the idea of contorting the laws of nature to practical applications. However, I am aware of the major hurdles a non-STEM/non-engineering majors face (from my research, essentially involves getting another Bachelors). I have some experience with computer programming (e.g. digital signal processing in matlab) and soldering guitars, amps and pedals, but doubt that application is rigorous enough for academic standards.

I went to a decent, but not amazing school (a usnews top 50 college) for undergrad and am hoping to get some perspective on what realistic expectations I should have in pursuing these interests further instead of resigning to the JD/MBA path so many of my academic peers have pursued (and of which I would be much more competitive).

First, I apologize for the vagueness of my questions, however: How possible is it to pursue a STEM masters with a liberal arts bachelors? Is engineering a feasible field to get into (or start getting into) at age 25 (as of now, I would love to pursue a music-related engineering discipline, such as digital signal processing for audio)? Can I use more parentheses (yes, I can!)?

ps. i expect to narrow this down by the time i apply... I would just really appreciate some candid advice so I know where to focus my efforts. thanks :).

One possibility is to create a separate note-taking system that explicitly itemizes and arranges connections like this as they come up. But this potentially causes a lot of overhead in maintaining one's system of note-taking.

A useful tool along these lines is creating tags. But while tagging notes allows you to pull up content associated with a given tag, it doesn't necessarily make the connections between papers / ideas explicit and easily processed.

What I'm thinking would be useful would be something like a hyperlink system where e.g. the notes document for P could have links to the note documents for X, Y, and Z explicitly added.

First, I love biochemistry. I'm constantly reading new articles and original research, especially about RNA Interference, which I would love to do research in.

At school, my professors are good chemists, no doubt, but they don't have much to offer me in the way of guidance. They are all more interested in other fields of chemistry, and across the board are not interested in anything related to computer science.

So, do any of you have any guidance to offer or advice on how I could pursue these passions? My dream would be to actually work with a group of fellow researchers on a common problem, while offering to write methods for data collection, analysis, and visualization.

Last week I submitted a paper to an international conference, assuming that as long as the publication is international, the journal doesn't matter.

I was told otherwise today. One of the lecturers in my college (who I should really talk to more about this) told me that several of academics had come together (in India, but it could be happening elsewhere too), and they work under the banner like ""Institute of Research Engineers and Doctors"", and publish accepted papers in journals that they themselves started. (A few of these journals have 3 or 4 issues, one per year, at the moment) The publications promise an ISBN number, but from what I am told, it's not that hard for a journal to be listed that way.

The incentive of these people in doing such a thing is that they charge an overwhelming fee (1/6th to 1/10th of a month's salary) for organizing these paper presentation events (which very weirdly are always held in big hotels, and tourist locations).

Can anyone confirm my doubts about such scams, or guide on how to find trustworthy journal sources?

e.g. The journals on [this](http://theired.org/journals.html) page. All of them started 2 years ago, and all the sites have the same design. It's almost scary. The sites aren't listed on Web of Trust (WoT) either.

Thanks.

When reviewers ask for these analyses they are often ones I have already done, but left out because they don't contribute to the main point of the article.

Since I'm on the more independent side of the spectrum, I end up in this situation with some frequency.  

There are advantages to having your PI keep a distance, but also frustrations: PI's get to your abstract/manuscript last, isn't willing to give you ""time off"" to go to conferences (even when funding isn't important), and is just generally less willing -- for obvious reasons -- to contribute funds from a limited store.   The biggest problem I find is that it's hard to be motivated with my project, though I very much believe in it.  My PI is nice to me personally and supports my career, but he doesn't have a lot of nice things to say about the work because he isn't very interested in results or even the final outcome.  I don't think working like this is a suicide mission, though.  One my best friends got a *Nature* paper (and a faculty position) out of one of those situations, and I've known others to do so as well.  

The issue in my case is that I came to a lab within my area of expertise just as, unbeknownst to me, the PI was moving into another field. The whole process of talking about the job (postdoc) to getting me up for an interview/recruitment to hiring me and having me move and start was about 8 months, and in that time he had made a very big shift.  There was a about a 60% turnover in lab members in one year and the people doing what I do left and more people doing the new big thing came in.

I'm double majoring in Chinese and International Studies. Within International Studies, I've chosen an IR/poli sci focus. However, I think what I'm really interested in has more to do with sociology, specifically the crossroads of sociology and technology.

Basically I want to look at how institutions, social structures, and international relations are being affected by technological change, namely globalization and the growth of the Internet. But I'm not sure if there's a specific branch of sociology/IR that this would be filed under for the purposes of finding a grad school program, or even if it's an actual field of study.

My sense is that IR has more to do with the political side of things, which I'm less interested in, but it seems like with the Internet you have a whole new type of international relations: not between governments, but between societies. So sort of a democratization of the whole international stage, a new global public forum. That's what I want to study, I just don't know where exactly it would be classified in academia.

**TL;DR— is ""sociology of international communication"" a thing?**

I would also like to be able to utilize my experience with China with case studies/field research, but I don't really know what that would mean or what it would look like since my background is more IR than sociology.

I just completed my first year in a humanities Ph.D. program and am working on submitting a paper for a conference.  The organizers have also requested a CV. 

I have a template that I've been looking at in ""Graduate Study for the 21st Century,"" so I'm familiar with the general categories that are included.  However, the template is intended for someone going onto the job market who has developed their own courses and has some publications under their belt.  

At the moment, I have done neither of those things.  I entered my graduate program with a B.A., but during the end of my undergrad career, I did work which could be considered ""graduate-level research"" (i.e. receiving a fellowship to develop and complete a research project of my choice, as well as writing a thesis).  Over the course of working on my research project, I was invited to give a guest lecture in an undergraduate class.  Since starting graduate school, I have given a guest lecture in an undergraduate class, and also served on a panel discussion related to my area of research.  

My questions are: can I list the guest lectures I have given on my CV?  Can the panel discussion be included under a ""Presentations"" heading which would also include an upcoming paper I will be presenting at a graduate student conference?  

I'm leery of it seeming like I'm ""padding"" my CV, but I'm concerned that I don't have too much to work with.  I know that it would be reaching a bit too far to include the fellowship conference where I presented my project as an undergrad, as well as my undergrad department's symposia where I delivered my thesis, so I will definitely be leaving those out.

Let me begin with a bit of my personal background. In high school I excelled at math of all kinds getting top ranking scores on all the AP tests I took, going into college with what little guidance I had it was decided that I would major in math. After a while of taking college calculus, the snootiness and downright hurtful things engineering students would say to me deterred me from math/engineering degree path - at the time it felt like I didn't want to be associated with these kinds of folk(nothing personal, a bad experience on my part). I swapped majors 4 times and by the end of college I graduated with a BS in biochemistry(would have preferred chemistry but I just wanted out for several reasons). College was a challenging time for me, not because of financial issues but my mental health was deteriorating after a break up with my girlfriend, soon to be wife of 5 years. I learned that I had autism, bipolar, agoraphobia, social anxiety, substance abuse problems and stress related psychotic episodes. I never made a single friend at school despite trying to engage people, but I failed over and over. I was afraid to talk to my professors, the first time I went to my organic chemistry professor to discuss an exam he was literally screaming at some poor girl and I was mortified. I couldn't talk to anyone, I went into isolation, I had a mental breakdown, every time I went outside I had a panic attack. I managed to pull out of school with a 3.4 GPA but no references. I tried to get into research groups but I was denied on account of my junior status and funding issues. That is basically my back story leading up to a few questions.

Firstly, is it possible to get into grad school with such few references? Would a teacher whose class I did really well in vouch for me if I went back and told them this story or am I SOL? I would like to learn more about the biomarkers for mental illness and how receptors play a role in the development of the aforementioned if admitted to graduate school. Secondly, math and chemistry have always been my main interests, i'm thinking of pursuing a second BS in chemical engineering. I have applied to many jobs(100+) with only a few bites that told me I did not have the research experience/qualifications. I want a stable career and I want to do something I am passionate about, so I am thinking about this second BS. Are there Co-op programs for people in my situation who want to earn a degree yet still work? Are these available through school? Lastly, should I try to get a lab tech job right now to fill time and gain some experience? the only 2 jobs i've ever had were an arcade manager and a waiter. People treated me very cruelly and it is hard to get back into public without being terrified of being attacked/hurt emotionally.

One is a two year program, with the only requirement being that the lab I work in has to do with cancer in some way, the other is biology honors research program.

The problem lies in the fact that my end goal after graduation is to go to grad school for specialization in a more physical based science. I am especially interested in nano robotics whether from a physics or chemistry perspective.

I got into these programs mostly because a researcher/director was impressed by my performance during an internship I participated in. I was struggling with keeping my apartment having come from extremely poor circumstances, and these program offered financial support immediately so that I wouldn't fall under.

I do enjoy the work still, since my natural curiosity keeps me interested in anything science, in any field. However, as stated above my personal interest lies in more high tech physical applications/research.

How affected would my application to graduate programs in nanorobotics/nanotech be if most of my research during undergrad years was in a variety of fields (chemistry, biophysics). Some additional info on the programs I am in: They are both programs with heavy emphasis on professional development in preparation for graduate study. Both have a lot of requirements with presenting research, poster design, and strengthening the scientific ability of the participants.

I'm a high school senior about to go off to college, but my parents don't seem to agree with where I want and are being rather forceful about me going to the college of their choice and not mine.
I was accepted into Cornell University, Univerisity of Miami, Univerity of Florida, and Florida Atlantic Univerity. 
As much as I'd LOVE to go to Cornell, I realize that financially it's not very logical (It'd cost around 60000 per year).

I don't qualify for any real financial aid because my parents' incomes are too high. 
Because of the financial situation, I want to go to the best school that's reasonably priced. 
I'd like to go to UF, but my parents are in heavy favor of FAU.
(For those of you not in Florida, UF is the best public university in Florida and ranked #58 in the country overall and is in the top 40 for engineering, FAU is effectively unranked for everything and is the best school within 50 miles of my house)

If I went to FAU, I'd have to live at home (which I really don't want to do) and after the Presidential Scholarship that I was given and my Florida Prepaid Tuition, I'd make $4000 per year attending there.

If I went to UF, tuition would be covered through Florida Prepaid, and I'd have to pay for a dorm for the first year (after that one of my very close and wealthy friends is getting a house and would let me live there with him). 

I've tried showing my parents the advantages of UF over FAU and they keep saying that they're irrelevant. I really feel there's no convincing my parents to let me go. I am 18 and could technically just pay the tuition deposit to UF and go without my parents concent but I don't really know how well that'd work. My parents have already payed the tuition deposit for FAU more or less without my concent. 

Right now, I want to study engineering, but I'm not sure how long that will last. I am heavily biased towards mathematics (780 on SAT math) but have done quite well through high school (16 AP classes taken with a 4.7 HPA and band all 4 years). 

There really is no doubting that UF is a better school than FAU. Is the $4000 enough to justify going to an inferior school and living at home.

IF I do end up going to FAU, I am almost CERTAIN that I will transfer after I finish my AA. But, I'm not sure my parents would approve of that... Is it wrong that I hold my parents' opinion so highly and don't act on my own behalf or should I trust my parents' judgment?

Please give me advise :/

I am a first-year Ph.D. student.  Yesterday I met with my advisor and during our meeting, I presented her with how I would like to frame my research in general terms.  She suggested that I contact a professor in another department, and suggested that I look into joining this particular department's interdisciplinary research cluster.  

So, I've done some poking around, and this prof seems like she would be a great person to be in conversation with as my research progresses, and ideally, I would like to have her on my committee for QEs.  

I've been sitting down to write this email to this professor, and am realizing that I'm unsure how to frame the purpose of this email.  I want to ask her about her current research, without sounding like I haven't bothered to look her up, and also to tell her a little about myself, without the email becoming a series of ""I"" statements.  She is also director of this research cluster.

So, if you will indulge me, this is what I have so far: 

Dear Professor X,

I am a new graduate student in the R Studies program whose work examines the cultural topography of Southern California, with a focus on artist interventions in public spaces.  Professor Y is my advisor and suggested that I contact you to learn more about your work as well as the Q Studies Research Cluster.  My previous research has looked at Chicano Park as a resistant response to the spatial politics in the city of San Diego, and at present, I am looking at how artists critically engage structures related to transit, such as freeways. 

I have visited the QSRC's website, and am particularly interested in the cluster's research areas of Urban Culture and Spaces and Social Justice.  Next week, I am hoping to attend the Brown Bag talk on transit-oriented development, if my schedule allows.  I noticed that supplementary texts for the Brown Bag series are posted to the QSRC's website and are accessible by members.  Would it be possible for you to tell me a bit more about what the process of becoming a member of the QSRC entails? 

Additionally, although I have enrolled in courses for next quarter, I am interested in learning if at this time, you are planning on teaching any graduate seminars next year.
 
Asking if she is teaching grad seminars is in part because my advisor and I are in the process of working out a loose ""big picture game plan"" for my coursework next year to make sure that I get my requirements covered.  The professor that I'm emailing is currently working on a book, although it doesn't coincide with my particular focus.  Should I ask about it anyway? Is there anything in particular that I should be asking that I'm not?  Is there anything that I *am* asking that I shouldn't be?  

tl;dr: Need to contact a professor that I don't know, but want to work with.  Don't want to blow it.

-I'm in my fourth semester as a Computer Science major, and am 19.
-I am behind in my classes. Most significantly mathematics, seeing as how I need to take one this summer to keep myself within a four-year degree and that is only assuming I can pull off my current class.
-I'm on 'probation'. If i don't do well this semester I will be, from the sound of it they will try to talk me into changing majors. Not to mention loss of scholarships may happen either way.

I feel lost as to what to do about this. I guess I'll explain my view on my current major:
I love it. The first two classes on programming was great and while it is challenging, it didn't feel grueling. I enjoy the idea of starting a career in a small game company with all its pros and cons(I've looked into it well enough that I believe I would enjoy it).

My problem is my mathematics. Simply put my foundation of math is plain horrible. The sole reason I did okay throughout elementary is because my parents helped teach me-often when teachers didn't(I literally had no math two full years, in two different schools). As a result I hit brick walls and have trouble getting through them.

In general, I am a B or C student. I do extremely well on projects even with bad procrastination habits, but standardized exams(multiple choice) drag me down. 

If I was flat out told I was not allowed to continue in this major I'm not sure what I would go into-which is part of what I want Reddit's help for. I just looked through my universities majors and can't find exactly what I was looking for. I remember the difference between a first-glimpse at CS and the more in depth reality of CS as being somewhat different-to the point I almost chose a different major based on the initial description.

-I see myself as being an architect, but can't find a straight answer on what sort of job environment i would be able to get realistically. Any comments on this field is useful

-I can't seem to find a art major that deals with cgi. Good artists of other mediums have trouble as it is, and I'm terrible. However I seem to intuitively understand and have a little experience with 3-d modeling. I can't seem to find what major would most closely get me into the sort of job where I can be modeling things for games, movies, tv, ads, etc. Based off of a class I found the closest I see is Informatics, is this right?

-Staying with my current major. I feel uneasy about this major. I love actually doing directly relevant classes but feel my math will drag me down before i can even graduate. I'm currently paying for a private tutor to help me every few weekends(AKA before tests) and look to khanacademy and the likes for help but I do horrible in exams often, and if I couple that with some undone homework I have to drop/fail the class outright. 

Any advice/comments/questions would be incredibly helpful.

The suit targets the Fish and Wildlife Service, who signed off on the plans based on studies supplied by one of the cities (the article isn't clear which), and says that their finding is incorrect and illegal. This led me to the following train of thought:

It seems like every time a study is discussed that has been funded by a powerful organization like a corporation or government agency and argues in said organization's favor, or in the favor of another organization that said organization favors, the inevitable question of the study's bias is raised. Frequently, I hear that such studies cannot be trusted, usually with the explicit or implicit argument that the scientists involved must be corrupt shills who, in one way or another, lied or distorted the facts in order to ensure that their results benefited the people paying them. Obviously, there are examples of such corruption, such as the fabricated Vioxx studies, but what I wonder is how frequently this actually occurs. Obviously, there aren't exactly hard numbers on this, but being the skeptic that I am, I'm skeptical of both sides. On the one hand, it seems there is a significant likelihood that studies like these can't be trusted, for various reasons, but on the other hand, I'm also heavily inclined to trust that experienced scientists working in their fields know what they're talking about.

Essentially, I would like to know if skepticism about studies backed by organizations they could benefit is credible, and to what extent these studies are likely biased. More importantly, being a layman, how should I regard these studies? Should I make assumptions about a study's credibility based on its sponsors? Obviously, being a layman, I'm not exactly in a position to understand these studies in their entirety, but assuming that I don't have someone credentialed and trustworthy to interpret the results and discuss possible flaws, I'm not sure how I should regard these studies if I'm, say, reading an Ars Technica or other news article about their results.

I want to pursue a Master's degree and work in the international business field. The university I did my study abroad program is offering me a great deal on a Master's in International Management, and because classes are in the evenings I can work/intern also. Even better, one of my best friends wants to do the program with me. 

My friend's mother, who is from Russia, is trying to say that this is a bad idea, however. I am SO excited for this, thrilled at the classes offered and living in Moscow again for 2 years. Doing graduate school in the US doesn't excite me at all, even though I know I could get into a good school (I didn't apply to any for the upcoming year). This program would be from September-mid-June both years, with the second year focusing on my writing a thesis. If I only stayed one year I would get a certificate, the 2nd year you earn your diploma. 

I want to be able to come back and live in Atlanta, GA and work for an international corporation who also operates in Russia.

But I'm not really enjoying myself. The kids are pretty well behaved, but they have very low interest in my lessons, many of them do the bare minimum on assignments, I hate grading assignments (tedious!!), and I feel like it doesn't matter how interesting I try to make my lessons ... half of the kids just don't care. 

I've got a BA in general science for secondary ed and I'm teaching middle school. I think teaching *might* be OK still, but maybe private school? maybe tutoring? I just want to feel like part of a team with my students... where they want to learn and I want to teach. Right now my classroom feels very one-sided. I do all the work and they act like the weight of the world is on their shoulders if I ask them to remember a few facts or put pencil to paper for more than 5 minutes.

So, teaching *might* be OK if I could either work with students who really wanted to learn ... or if I could learn some concrete and effective tricks to getting my current students significantly more motivated.

However, I'm kind of tired of being judged and tested every day by roomfuls of kids. I don't want to be a babysitter (even though my students are very well behaved, I still have to redirect them frequently when I'd rather be teaching them science). At this point, I think I need a career change.

I'm willing to go back to school, but nothing dramatic. (i.e., I don't want to dump more than a couple more years of my life into college). Ideally, I'd like to do something more rewarding than teaching. 

I used to *love* going to college, I was a straight A student and I felt successful, and I felt good about myself every single day. As a teacher, I feel good about myself maybe one or two days per month. The job is just killing me emotionally. I need a job where my hard work and intelligence actually has some value. I just have no clue what that job is.

I like science, I *might* still like teaching in the right conditions, I *can* see myself in a lab environment if it pays ok, I can see myself involved in writing textbooks or science books for kids, I can also see myself doing something completely unrelated to science (as long as it pays ok, I think I'd be happy doing any mindless job at this point).

The bottom line is that I spend *way* too much of my time preparing lessons, grading work, and dealing with students outside of class ... and I see very little come out of the kids as a result. I'm not sure that I'm doing anything of value as a teacher and it is just too much work to feel that way. If I'm not going to do anything of value, I'd like to not work overtime for free in the process. I envy the people who work at McDonald's because they show up, do their job, and go home. They get paid for the hours they work, and their customers get what they want and are usually pretty happy. As a teacher, I do extra work and my students are rarely happy. 

I know this makes me sound like a crappy teacher, but I get rave reviews from everyone who observes my lessons. I honestly think I'm a decent teacher who just doesn't want to teach.

I will graduate from college soon with a ~2.5 because I failed two courses this semester. My GPA before this semester was 3.02. If I had to sum up reasons for failing at college I'd say it's because I couldn't deal with the pressures in my life. My parents are extremely poor and both of them are ill. I wish I wasn't such a failure so I could leave my parents come May to sustain myself, and hopefully sustain them someday. I don't have any close friends or relatives to ask for favors. I cannot afford to go back to college next semester even with student loans.

My plan is to eventually go to graduate school for Chemistry. I have yet to take my GREs for fear of screwing them up. I score 325+ on practice tests and score great on the Chemistry subject practice test (I don't have a number score to report because I do problems in practice books). I know that scoring well in practice means nothing for real life that's why I haven't taken either exam yet.

I want to get real life experience, like doing research in a lab or company. I will get recommendations from my PI at uni and other profs when I apply, but I can't bring myself to start this process because of my bad grades. And yeah, some of those bad grades are in Chemistry related subjects. Am I doomed? Suicide is not an option.

One of his papers (published in Science!) had stirred a considerable discussion in popular press and blogs a while ago, as it claimed that people tend to discriminate more against each other when placed in a noisy, messy environment. Everybody liked it, as it sounds a kind of plausible. Now is it also a fake?

* http://www.sciencemag.org/content/332/6026/251.abstract

So how he did it?

..The committee, which interviewed dozens of Stapel's former students, postdoctoral researchers, co-authors, and colleagues, found that Stapel alone was responsible for the fraud. ...He would discuss in detail experimental designs, including drafting questionnaires, and would then claim to conduct the experiments at high schools and universities with which he had special arrangements. The experiments, however, never took place, the universities concluded. Stapel made up the data sets, which he then gave the student or collaborator for analysis, investigators allege. In other instances, the report says, he told colleagues that he had an old data set lying around that he hadn't yet had a chance to analyze. When Stapel did conduct actual experiments, the committee found evidence that he manipulated the results.

To be honest, one of the reasons I got a BA is because it was easier than getting a BS.  But I've spent the past couple of years in a job that I don't particularly like and has little to no advancement opportunities.  Additionally, there's very few jobs I'm interested in that are attainable with my current training.  While I in no way consider my previous major a mistake, I have definitely come to realize that it's not sufficient.

I've read in many places that it is stupid to get a second Bachelor's.

So that doesn't seem to make a whole lot of sense.  Does it mostly apply when talking about two BA's, or two BS's?  Or am I missing something?

I'm not certain yet whether I'd want to stay in academia and pursue a PhD or if I'd rather just get a job as soon as possible.

I almost made my mind up to take that offer, but maybe there are some fellow redditors who did or do a PD there and could tell me a little about what to expect.
One of my concerns are the working conditions, especially the expected working hours. I know that a PD at a prestigeous University is always a lot of work, and I'm not afraid of that. However, I spent some time at eastern asian Universities and the working hours there are mostly incredible up to the point of being ridiculous. A fourteen hour day was the norm, Saturdays were work days and not showing up at least on two sundays a month was also frowned upon. This, however, was basically only _physical_ presence: Even the most senior PhD students worked appalingly inefficient (sleeping for four hours at their desk, wasting away a whole day playing WoW and then pulling an all nighter because the professor is such a mean guy and expects too much), and this is the reason I actually turned down two offers from (also quite prestigeous) Universities in Eastern Asia.
I heard from people doing PhD/PostDoc at other ""big names"" in the US (MIT, CalTech, Berkely, Harvard) that that it's very much alike, but most of it is hearsay (I don't know anyone who has first hand experience) and I highly doubt that it's exactly like that.
So, Stanfordians, tell me of your experiences, tell me if I have to expect to sacrifice one year completely to my carreer, or if I will actually have the chance for a good time there :).

I feel such a sense of accomplishment when I take a class, master it, and walk away with an A or A+. I listen to podcasts HowStuffWorks.com put out every night before bed. I watch documentaries in my free time. Everything that I find fun involves some kind of learning: Wine/Beer/Scotch tasting, museums, speakers, cultural events. Things of that nature.

I really see myself using my knowledge acquisition drive to help others. Psychology as my chosen field, I thought I'd go into clinical psychology so I'd have a way to help people directly, while still teaching and doing research. But in my experience working at a behavioral health office and as a rape crisis counselor, I dont think I can handle working directly with people's emotions and mental functioning long term.

I've been studying math for a month because I'm planning to take the GRE in August and generally answer about 50% of the answers correctly. I score a bit higher on verbal.

I have a bit of money that was to be applied to college, but since I got a scholarship that covered my entire tuition, it's still available. But I'm at an impasse...WTF DO I DO NOW!?!?!?

I'm enrolled in a Chemical Engineering in a Singaporean university. Not a top student, but I have pretty ok grades: 3.81/5 GPA. With a minor in Entrepreneurship (started a student venture along the way).

What I lack in hardcore grades I make up for in experience &amp; loads of internships.
I've done 2 years worth of research internships (chemistry related), have won a gold medal with team at iGEM 2009, MIT. Have worked with P&amp;G in Paris for 6 months, and altogether 11 months in France. I speak conversational French. Took part in loads of competitions (like iGEM mentioned above) and others too. At least 5-6 in the past 4 years. On the side, I've self-learnt a bit of programming, working on my first iOS app this break, recently launched a personal website for essays and some such.

I'll be taking the GRE, TOEFL/IELTS, and French DALF B2 exams asap to get them out of the way. Because of the internship in France, I need to postpone my graduation date by a year so that'll be in **May 2012**. What should I do, and what can I do, to get a scholarship to do my Masters?

A bit about Masters: ideally, I want to do something interdisciplinary &amp; contributive, like Development Engineering (scoped courses in Tokyo, Netherlands) or Engineering &amp; Public Policy (scoped in CMU USA and CEU Hungary among others). But at this stage, really, anything related to these fields, with a scholarship will do.

I'm really on panic mode; if I don't get any scholarship, there's no way at all to pursue this path, and I definitely don't want to be a Chemical Engineer or researcher, ever.

I'm a college sophomore at the University of Mississippi and I have a 3.0 gpa. I am conflicted with I want to major in. I am currently a business economics major, but I have an extreme interest in computer science. I have the option of double majoring in a BA in economics and computer science, but I don't know how well a BA in comp sci would do when it comes time for internships/research opportunities. I see that a BS in comp sci is more favored than a BA except if it is from Berkeley. I'm also worried about doing a BA in economics because I don't know how well that would do when it comes applying for internships(in the business world too)/research opportunities compared to a BBA in economics. I hate that I go to Ole Miss because I feel that I am restricted in terms of moving up in the world versus someone who goes to a tier one school. I want to get out of Mississippi and I want to be a competitive candidate when I apply for grad school, scholarships, and jobs. I don't want to have to settle for less because of what school I go to. I guess that's a summary of what's going on. If you want more details just AMA. 

Here are my questions...


Should I do a BA in Economics and Computer Science, BS in Computer Science and Minor in economics, BBA in economics and minor in computer science or do a dual degree in a BBA in economics and BS in computer science(this would take super long to complete I think.)? I want to be very flexible and not restricted by my degree. 


How can I make the most of my education at Ole Miss and be a competitive candidate (possibly on par with candidates that go to top schools) so I can move up in the world?

I apologize for sounding a bit naive in my post. I am just really stressed and I don't know what to do. I don't have anybody I can talk to about my goals and desires. I'm a first gen college student. I know my gpa is a bit low and I know I can bring it up. Thanks for reading my long post.

I graduated with a B.S. in Biological Anthropology yet my ultimate career goal is to be a physician (particularly a D.O.).  I am planning to go back to school and take the prerequisites for med schools and to study for the MCAT.  As of right now, I am also considering getting certified as a medical assistant for several reasons:

1)	I want the experience in the medical field.
2)	There are a lot of jobs available for this position.
3)	It pays well enough that it can help pay for my education (or a portion of it).  

I have spoken to several medical assistant programs and they said that it would provide me with the experience necessary when working in the medical field as well as the edge over other students in med school programs.  The problem is, that is their opinion and I would like to have more insight.

What I would like to know is, am I wasting my time if I decide to be a medical assistant despite the fact that my main goal is to be a physician?

I would really appreciate an honest input please.  Thank you.

* Went to college for a year and realized I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life; finished the first year but didn't re-matriculate.

* One ""gap year"" turned into four: landed an internship which turned into a paid position, realized I loved the work (public policy advocacy [""lobbying""]), hit the salary ceiling due to my lack of a degree.

* Went back to (a much better) university to pursue my BA in political science (minoring in philosophy).

Present day:

I'm now a junior with an excellent GPA and have realized that though the germ for my political passions may have been domestic policy, being exposed to myriad international relations courses (which I took as electives) has made me realize I'd much rather work for the Council on Foreign Relations, the State Department, or an IGO that will allow me to work on international policy issues.

My plan is to go to pursue an MIA but I've realized something scary: most of them require strong quantitive reasoning skills, including advanced calculus, econometrics, statistics, and so on. I haven't taken a math course since junior year of *high school*. I plan on taking the required math courses for my degree, but I'm terrified that my lack of upper level math/quant will render my otherwise solid transcript moot in an age where (it seems to me) every social science is becoming more and more numbers-based.

I have done internships for international relations think tanks (mostly political-military analysis and nonproliferation work) and have won plenty of scholarships/departmental honors for my research papers, but I doubt those experiences will outweigh my lack of math/statistic/economics.

Having read all that (thank you! I'm sure plenty more people saw a Wall of Text and skipped it): what advice would you give?

My university has a few programs where undergraduates can partake in the research process; however since I am at the cusp of graduating I do not qualify for any of them. I've only got a single semester left. I guess my questions are the following: how inappropriate would it be if I wrote a research paper on my own and had a professor read it and advise me? I would not be doing this work in association with the university meaning that I would not be receiving any kind of credit. Can professors engage students in academic endeavors unassociated with the university?

I humbly ask for your collective advice and experience concerning graduate school. I've been working for 7 years since I graduated college and built up some good work experience and make decent money. However, I am only getting farther away each day from what I really think I want to do with my life. Anyway, I will describe my circumstances and an approximation of what I want to try and accomplish and then leave it to you to respond with anything you feel might be helpful, insightful, optimistic, pessimistic, whatever the case may be. I can use all the advice I can get.

Currently I work a steady 40 hour a week job that pays me a decent salary in the Network admin / IT realm. Benefits and vacation included. I have a $337 a month car payment that I would like to try and maintain, but we’ll say for the sake of discussion that it is optional that I continue to try and afford my auto.

Here is my academic circumstance. I graduated from college 7 years ago with my BA in Geography and BA in Geology. Minor in Environmental Studies. My primary areas of interest are geospatial sciences (GIS), historical geology, sedimentary geology and volcanology. I was involved with GIS professionally for 3 years, and have been exposed to it or working with it in some capacity for about 6 years. Furthermore if I could incorporate GIS into my studies at least to some degree(If I take the Geology path for example), I would be delighted. One thing I think is also important to mention in relation to the geology portion of my interests...there are a decent amount of geology courses I would have taken if it were my primary major, but since I needed to fill 36 credit hours after my geography major, I decided to take the BA of geology. It was a mistake in hindsight that I didn't just go for my BS of Geology, but I am willing to do what it takes to remedy it. Courses that in my opinion I lack that I feel might hurt me include but are not limited to: Mineralogy, Stratigraphy &amp; Sedimentation, Petrology, a Geology field course, chemistry at the college level and calculus.

So much for background and interests. I have about $37k in student loan debt remaining at this point, but outside of that I have my car payment ($337/mo) and living expenses(rent,phone,utils,insurance). I am willing to take out some loans if need be for school, but I would like to somehow try and work and go to school...even if it’s just part time work. Some source of income would be preferable to none.

As for my past academic records, I suppose I should start with what I fear will hurt me. My cumulative GPA from college, 7 years ago, was a 2.734. I don’t know if it matters really, but my major coursework in Geography and Geology was easily above a 3.0 average at all times. Once I was able to focus on my majors, everything improved substantially. Also, as I said, this was 7 years ago. So much has changed in terms of motivation, focus, social circumstance, maturity, etc... Can something like this be conveyed?

Also I understand that I need to take the GRE, which I have never done. That speaks for itself I think, and any advice about taking the GRE, preparing for it, what to study, how to study, experiences with it, etc... would be very much appreciated.

Finally, a friend of mine who completed grad school in recent years had this to say: 
*“When applying, the departments are most worried about GPA and GRE scores.  Although, any previous research or work in the field can sometimes be the deciding factor.  Most importantly, figure out what kind of research you would like to do, and find someone at an institution that is doing similar research.“*
To what degree does that hold validity in your experience? Not that I doubt what he said, but rather, in comparison to your own experiences.

Ok Reddit, I think you understand what I’m up against. It’s been a long time since I was in school, and I need to get my path back on track so I at least have a fighting chance at the type of career interests that I have held onto for so long. I understand there is a lot of difficulty ahead of me in this pursuit, but I really just want to try and lay out in front of me what I am up against and then see if I can pull it off. ANY advice, testimony, stories, experiences, contacts, links, warnings, etc...that you would care to share would be greatly appreciated. Thanks so much for your time.

1363300610.0,6,self.AskAcademia,1abayx,Questions about graduate school and application process from an applied math and physics undergrad,8,2,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/1abayx/questions_about_graduate_school_and_application/,"Hi AskAcademia! A little background info: I am currently a sophomore at a  tier 1 research university (UW-Madison) and in the past year have very heavily been considering attending graduate school to try and get my PhD. I originally was studying Computer Engineering but I quickly realized that I was more interested in continuing my education rather than entering the job field right out of college like most of my peers in the program intend to do. I thought about it very heavily this past year and decided that I wanted to continue my education and if fate allows, go on to work in academia. This past semester I switched majors to Applied Math, Engineering, and Physics and have now been trying to figure out what I need to do to start preparing myself for application to graduate school, almost certainly in Physics but possibly Math. I have had very little luck talking to my math advisors about grad school and I haven't been able to meet with my physics adviser because he's been out of the country. I'm really just trying to figure out what I need to be doing at this point in my college education to ensure that I will have a strong application to graduate school. Here are most of the questions I've had, but any other advice would be greatly appreciated.

1) When do I need to start finding research experience? Am I already behind if I don't have any experience and I'm a sophomore? What are the best ways to find research opportunities? Can I really just ask a professor to do research with them, or is there generally a formal application process like any other job? Should I expect to get paid to do reserach as an undergrad, like a part time job? Will I be introduced to research opportunities through my advanced coursework, or do I need to go out and find them myself? Can anybody do research, or do I need prior experience/more education? How much experience is needed to make a grad school app appealing? What should I expect out of undergrad research in terms of the work I'd be doing and my overall involvement in the research?

2) Who are the best candidates for getting letters of reccommendation? If I don't know any professors or researchers around campus, what is the best way to go about forming relationships with potential candidates for lor? Will I naturally form relationships with professors as my classes become more advanced, or do I need to be taking the initiative to introduce myself to professors and get to know them? Is there a line that shouldn't be crossed in terms of taking the initiative to get to know a professor, or are they generally accustomed to meeting new undergrads?

3) Do I need to be published to get into a good grad school? Will I be able to find oppurtunities to get published in my more advanced coursework, or do I need to be taking the initiative on my own? Do I need to be doing signficant outside study in research in my field if I want to consider myself worthy of doing research? What if I just don't have the knowledge yet to interpret a serioues research paper? How do you find good topics for scientific papers? Will it become easier to write papers and find research topics as I progress further in my coursework, or will it pretty much be the same as it is now? Is it best to just write a senior thesis and try to get that published? How difficult is it to write a senior thesis? Do I need to know my topic before even considering writing a senior thesis, or will a professor be able to help me along the way? If I want to get into a good grad school, do I NEED to write a senior thesis?

4) What is a good GPA for applying to grad school? Will anything less than a 3.75 disqualify me from getting into top tier schools? What kinds of things make a grad school app very strong? Should I pretty much accept that I won't be able to get into a top tier school because I only recently made the decision to pursue grad school? Is there still hope for me eventhough my grades aren't perfect (3.745 GPA) and I don't have any research or writing experience yet, or is it too late to build a strong grad school app?

5) What do I do if I don't get accepted anywhere? Do I just try to find more research opportunities and try again next year? Is it a bad sign if I don't get accepted to a grad school the first year after graduation? Will my undergradute degree be enough to get a paid research position that will get me through the year, or will I probably need to work a part-time job to pay the bills?

6) Is it enough to have the drive and desire to pursue a PhD, or is there something more that makes a good grad student? Are some people just not the type to pursue grad school? How can I know if I've got the stuff for grad school? What can I do to improve myself and distinguish myself as someone who is serious about pursuing a PhD? Who can I talk to at my univeristy about preparing myself for grad school and the steps I need to be taking to get there?

I'm sorry if some of these questions seem a bit foolish. I'm only a sophomore and I haven't gotten much serious information about grad school and what it takes to get there so I'm just trying to get as much information as I can from people who have already gone through the application process. Any other advice that you think is important to an undergrad in my position would be very much appreciated.

I'm a second year math and physics major.

Going into college my dream job was to end up as a professor doing research in math. Recently I've come to the conclusion that I may not actually be heading in that direction. Its not that I don't love math, but I'm not sure if I'm bright or talented enough to pursue it on that level. So I'm really not sure what I want to do once I graduate(Job vs Grad School)

Anyways I've recently been offered an internship position, the position is being an analyst for a government contractor. The work itself seems interesting, but I have some slight moral quarrels with it.(government contractors targeting ""bad guys"", I'm all for national security but...)

I've also applied to a bunch of REU's. So far I have been rejected from all. So I've let them know I only have a week to decide what I'm to do this summer. 

My ""Stats""  are:
3.71 GPA
3.9 in major
Not too much in the way of prior research experience, I just started working in a lab this semester. 
Some Programming and lots of LaTex experience.
For what its worth I thought I wrote good essays.
I'd imagine good recommendations. 

I know I'm not headed for ""ivy"" school, but I thought that I would get into to some less known schools- so far this is not the case. 

So my question is how much more beneficial would an REU be to an internship? My feeling tells be an REU would be way better because I'd image grad schools don't care about internships and If I decide to get a job and REU would still look pretty good on my CV. 


My lack of success with these REUs is really making me question my potential as an academic, is this a reasonable reaction or is this not an accurate indicator of research potential ?

Thanks and Sorry for the long windedness of this post.

So I'm currently a second-year Electrical Engineering MS student. I did my BS in EE, as well, and I graduated in December 2009. My dilemma is that I'm a bit unsure that I should even be in grad school. Let me explain.

When I was applying to undergrad schools, I applied only to engineering programs. At the time, I told myself that I was doing that because I was genuinely interested in engineering, but looking back, I realize that I was applying to engineering for the wrong reasons.

* I assumed it was what I was ""supposed"" to do since I was in mostly advanced science and math classes in high school and no advanced humanities/arts classes.
* Most of my friends were doing it.
* I was afraid of what people would think of me if I didn't do engineering.
* I thought I would suck less at engineering than I would at anything else.
    Money.

So now, after 8 years or so, I'm coming to the realization that my entire post-high-school education has been a lie.

I'm currently working with a group at my university, but the project seems a bit...lightweight. For the sake of privacy, I'll just say that it involves modifying some mobile phone apps and then trying to quantify the difference in performance. But how am I supposed to convert that into a thesis? How many pages am I supposed to get out of that? It's not like I'm creating an app from scratch. I'm just adding to an already existing one.

It just seems so embarrassing when I see other MS students working on something, I dunno, meaty, whereas what I'm working on seems lightweight. I'm seriously considering just switching careers entirely and just dropping out.

I worked for a small biomedical company over the summer and really enjoyed it, despite it being a little outside of my field.  It was mainly the environment, small size, and opportunities to innovate and work on cutting-edge topics that I enjoyed.

My long term goal either way is to get involved in working with biomedical startups.  However, right now I'm thinking about trying to find a job this semester and leaving school after this year ends.  I would like to work in industry for a few years and then reapply to different schools for my PhD.

The questions:
1.) Will the fact that I dropped out hurt my chances when I reapply to different schools in a few years?

2.) Will having industry experience help me at all when I reapply, or will it be outweighed by how long it's been since I was in school?

2.) Should I stick it out for the two year master's before I leave?

3.) What am I doing with my life?

In a few weeks, I'll have a publication in review with me as a co-author. I'm still an undergrad, and am planning on having at the very least one more publication before I finish. 

I was wondering how important publications can be when applying to grad/PhD programs.. 

I have a decent, not fantastic GPA (~3.5 ), but I have extensive lab experience, and I'm expecting some pretty awesome letters of recommendation. 

What tier of programs should I consider applying to? What should I avoid? Any advice on choosing the straight to PhD program vs. Masters --&gt; PhD route?

What do I do?,21,14,38,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/152mhn/i_found_evidence_that_students_may_have_cheated/,"There's a group of students on a social network of which I am a member. Recently, students in the premed program at my university took an exam for a required course. In the days leading up to the exam, nearly everyone in the group was posting questions from the study guide of the course to ask how to solve a certain problem or something similar. (Of course, this is perfectly fine, as that's how people study!)  
  
However, a day or two before the exam, someone managed to get a hold of a leaked version of that course's exam (from what I've heard, it was a previous year, but the questions between years are remarkably similar). This leaked exam was posted to the group, and it quickly spread, with many students reviewing from the exam itself and sharing answer keys that they had produced. After the exam was written, the same students posted on the group remarking how it's almost like ""they'd seen the questions before"", and the link to the leaked exam was mysteriously deleted. As well, one student recommended that everyone who had posted anything relating to the leaked exam delete their posts, or else it may ""raise suspicion"". Apparently, more than one student was questioned by a proctor who had heard that an exam was floating around, but those students denied that anything like that had happened.  
  
My question is, should I inform someone at the university about this potential academic offence? I did not take the course or exam myself, but I did view the leaked exam and so it may still be in my temporary files somewhere. My major problem with the students doing this sort of thing is that 1. they had a major advantage over those honest students who studied directly from the given study questions, and 2. these students will be competing for scholarships, grants, and eventually professional school applications using marks they arguably did not deserve, and against honest students who worked for their marks.

1347745556.0,5,self.AskAcademia,zxz36,I am a new grad student who began reconsidering my career path. Is there anything I can do to get myself out of this bind?,8,3,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/zxz36/i_am_a_new_grad_student_who_began_reconsidering/,"This is a repost from another thread from which someone redirected me here.

Hello, Reddit. This is my first actual post, so I'm going to try my best to explain myself thoroughly while also keeping it clear.
I am 22 years old and have just begun grad school. A problem, however, that I am facing is that recently - really within a few months prior to my undergrad graduation - I began having serious doubts about the field that I am entering.

I completed a major in Linguistics and a minor in Communication Sciences and Disorders. I settled into this major/minor through sort of a long process of trial and error and enjoyed all of the classes I took under Linguistics a lot. But while they were fascinating, the jobs I could have with it - namely computational linguistics, language documentation, TESOL - did not interest me as much as simply the ""how-language-works"" part, I guess. I was eventually introduced to the prospect of becoming a speech-language pathologist and heavily considered it because at the time I felt that I would be applying the concepts I'd previously learned in linguistics towards therapy, as well as the fact that the job market for SLPs appears to be very good. Over time I grew complacent in this certainty, and it was only in the last semester of my senior year, with grad school looming on the horizon, that I began having doubts. I realise now that there's a large part of me that is unsatisfied with the career path (even though I still find the subject matter interesting), and wishes to pursue a field more aimed towards the development/research of future technologies - I've been looking into fields like AI, physics (especially optical and particle), and different kinds of engineering.

The issue with this is that historically I've been much better with language than math or physics in high school, and while I understand now that high school classes aren't a terribly accurate indicator of these actual fields of study, I never gave myself the chance to take classes in physics, for example, to test the waters. I would be willing to learn - if anything, the possibility I'd struggle would only spur me to keep trying. However, I'm embarrassed to admit that I'm coming across all of these career path considerations so late of my own fault. My peers are all certain that SLPs are what they're going to be, and I've been accepted into (and, hell, have even taken classes in) grad school, but I can't put my fears to rest. I've spoken to an undergrad career counselor and my grad school advisor, as well as several of my friends and family and have heard responses ranging from ""Whatever you do, just be happy"" (parents), to advice that I should just finish grad school to become a SLP to fund going back to school again if that's what I still want to do, to my grad school advisor telling me that it's an intense program and that I have to really *want* it for any hope of completion.

I was looking forward to completing undergrad with minimal loans and entering grad school with a mostly clean slate. However, leaving the program would mean I would have to repay 20% of the tuition cost (a silly policy the school has), on top of my previous undergrad loan, further atop rent payments unless I move away from my significant other to go back home. Needless to say I would need a job: my grad advisor said she would take me up as a grad assistant only if I decided to remain in the program, which only adds incentive to uncertainty. More loans may be required in the meantime in my job search, so I'm disheartened seeing the clean slate goal I'd worked towards slowly fall to ruin.

**So I have a few questions:** what do you recommend I do - remain in the program and use the future employment to go back to school? Leave now? Defer admission? Is a loan unavoidable at this point? And would I send myself back at least 2-3 years if I change course?

**If anyone has any knowledge about the fields I mentioned considering:** what is the job market like for any of them? Do you know of any companies/places I should specifically look into? What is the coursework / daily job work like? Would it help me to speak to professors involved in those fields at the university; would they have anything to tell me that I might not already know?

**Regarding jobs:** I'm looking into work-from-home kinds, such as Lionsbridge, because I'm in a different state without a car and live near campus but not places of employment. Is most university work restricted to enrolled students or can exceptions be made if I speak to the right person? Has anyone had experience with work-from-home to give some insight?

Whew. I understand this is a mouthful, but I feel sort of with my back against a wall. Any and all advice would be greatly appreciated, and if you have specific questions about anything, feel free to ask.

Hi, I'm one year out of college, and am considering continuing on to grad school. I majored in applied math as well as cognitive neuroscience (minor in cs) at a top tier school, though I floated around in my subject matter for quite a bit. At first I wanted to do bioinformatics - I did some coursework, loved it, then grew tired of it. Then I was really into brains. I did some coursework, loved it - then I did some lab work and hated it. I also had lasting love affairs with media studies, sociology, philosophy, and law.

When I graduated, I had no idea what I wanted to do. A friend told me that a poli sci research group needed someone to do some web design and some database work for the administration side of their team. I joined them, worked on the admin-y stuff for a summer, and befriended the poli sci grad students. My work was mildly interesting (at best), but I grew really fascinated with the grad students' projects. The lab did very data heavy empirical work with some really cutting edge modeling. I worked out a transition from the admin side of things to becoming a research assistant to the grad students. I loved the work that I did for them. I got to satisfy many of my academic 'needs' such as doing math, coding, and thinking about behavior and the law.

Anyway, I left the group I was working with to accept a summer internship at a top tier law school to do research under some of my favorite legal researchers. It's a great experience, and I am still able to take a data driven look at law and culture.

But, this internship is ending soon, and I'm not sure where to head next. Some days private sector work sounds exciting. Other days, it's academia.

**Questions actually start here**


I have a few worries about going back to school, and am wondering if you might have any input to help me think about this:

* I've been very academically fickle in the past, and am not sure if this phase is over. I 'dated' poli sci (and loved it) for about one year after graduation, but I still don't know if it's ""the one."" Should I try a stint in the private sector, and see if I still yearn for it after a year or two?

* Poli sci was attractive because I got to do math with an interesting subject matter. I *may* be more excited about the math behind poli sci than the poli sci itself. I'm also very interested in the private sector applications of the modeling skills I would pick up during the phd process and am realistic about the slim probabilities of successfully becoming a professor. Is this the wrong kind of mindset?

* I would most likely go back to my undergrad institution for grad school. This is due to strong connections with the faculty in the poli sci department who are willing to look beyond my not 3.5+ gpa. I also know with whom I would want to work with, and which outside courses (especially stuff within the math and cs departments) I would wish to take. There is a sense that I would be moving back to a place that I am 'comfortable'. Is this a bad idea?

* I also know what the conditions of the grad students at my alma mater are. They live pretty nice lives, have good offices, and are happy almost all of the time. Placement is very good as well. I think I could really thrive there, but I haven't seen anything else, so I don't know how this compares.

My nerves are shattered and it's completely unexpected-- teaching and lecturing have never been a problem for me. Again, I'm not a nervous public speaker and I'm confident in my research.

My family is very important to me. They've played a very big role in my life growing up. My parents and siblings and i are really close. We do everything together, and we rely on each other for emotional support.

Unfortunately, my interest in pursuing a PhD and an academic career after means it's almost certain i'm going to have to leave home, most likely to the US. That's almost literally on the other side of the world for me. It's very likely i'm going to have to base my entire career there, or somewhere else just as far away from home.

There are obvious ways, like communicating often via email and Skype, but my relationship with my family has never been particularly verbal. It's not based on talking. It's based on doing things together. And i really don't know how this would work across distance.

Here's an example of how a friend of mine did it, just to give you an idea of what i mean:

This friend of mine lived abroad for two years, and only came back a month ago. During the time he was away, he and his wife had an interesting way of keeping in touch. Both were avid readers and loved books. Whenever they found an interesting sentence, paragraph of passage in a book they were reading, they would record themselves reading it out, and send that recording to the other. I thought this was quite meaningful.

1. What are acceptable GRE scores to get into some of the better programs (~top 20)? (I understand all disciplines are different, but I would just like a general area to hit)

2. What is a good GPA to stand a chance at these top programs? (I've attempted to look for average GPA admitted but can find no such statistics) 

3. Some websites have suggested I obtain letters of recommendation form professors who are employed at the university of the grad program in question. How the hell does one go about doing that?  Who are the most valuable people to get letters from? 

4. I *may* pursue a 2nd bachelor in sociocultural anthropology (would only take me about another year or so). What weight, if any, would this bring to my grad application?

5. How does quality of classes factor in? (for example, taking upper division math courses vs lower division, or even taking some graduate level classes) 

6. [Econ centered question] I have taken or am planning on taking Calc 1+2, financial applications of calc, intro to stats, intro to linear algebra, and an upper division stats course. Would this be sufficient or will admissions committees wish to see more?

depth knowledge?",11,6,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/ocfeg/finish_as_quickly_as_possible_or_acquire_some/,"Hi AskAcademia, I have to make an important decision soon and would like some further advice (adding to the advice from family and friends) on what to do. 

Since I am not from the US, I think I have to explain some things before I start with the actual problem.

First off, I'm in my B.A. at the moment, studying in Europe. My major is social/political science, minor is (public) law, but my faculty is very interdisciplinary, so I also had some economics classes. A B.A. here lasts three years, i.e. six semesters. I just returned from an exchange semester somewhere else in Europe which was officially labeled as a vacation semester (to avoid tuition fees etc. - the university suggested to do that). 

I have the choice now of finishing within the next semester, factually having studied then for six semesters, but officially only five; OR I study for two more semesters, factually studying seven then, officially six. This is relevant because if we officially study more than six semesters, tuition fees rise. 

I don't really know now what is preferable. Reasons why I think studying seven semesters would be a good idea:

* since the faculty is interdisciplinary I lack a certain amount of in-depth knowledge in some areas, so another semester would give me the chance of improving that
* no further tuition fees because I'm legally not extending my B.A.
* a unique chance being at university to develop further as a scholar and a person so I should not rush through it as fast as possible but use the opportunity to become a GOOD scholar
* I could take more methodology/research methods classes which I think are very important
* I could further improve my grades (I do not know how that GPA works, but on a scale from 1 to 5, where 4 is pass and 5 is fail, 1 being the best, my average is 1.7 which is already quite good, but it could be better still)
* more time for language proficiency that will benefit me later (mainly looking at French here)
* time for two internships (one in the summer and one next year in the summer between my B.A. and M.A.), further improving my chances of being admitted to a better Master's programme

I'm definitely sure I want to go on with an M.A. (Or MSc for that matter), so studying longer in my B.A. would probably increase my chances of being admitted to a better programme.

On the other hand, I feel like I'm already ""late to the party"" a bit and do not like the thought of ""losing"" another whole year because of one further semester in my B.A. 

So I think the basic question is this: should I try to finish my B.A. as fast as possible because it will look odd/strange/weak to further potential employers if I took ""extra time"", or is it more important to become a well-educated individual with actual skills that took his time to really learn about ""what's going on""? ;-)

From my wording you can probably already guess to what choice I tend more, but I still want to hear what other academics have to say to my decisions ahead. Any comment is heavily appreciated and I thank everyone in advance that took the time to read my text.

So my question, should I take yet another internship to get more practical experience, or should I finish research and writing on a project that I've been dying to get back to? The professors I've talked to seem to think that my project has a possibility to end up in a small, regional journal, were I ever to actually complete it properly, and it really fascinates me.

I met my wife while studying at Derp State University. My wife and her family (to whom she is very attached) are from Derpville, where Derp State is located. After we married, I took her with me several thousand miles away to get my Ph.D in the geosciences. When we moved, we had a pact that wherever we moved post-Ph.D. it would be closer to Derpville than where we are now. In spite of this broadly-worded agreement, she never let it out of her heart that somehow we would end up back in Derpville. This desire of hers only burned hotter when we learned that several professors in the Geology department (both of whom share my specialty), would be retiring about the time I finished my Ph.D.

Six years have gone by. We have two children. Having kids has changed my priorities away from long field seasons and constant travel and towards stability. Together, my wife and I agreed that we would not pursue a post-Doc, the consequences for my academic career be damned. I have pursued a career in the oil and gas sector, and have just been offered a good, intellectually-stimulating and highly lucrative job with a company I like in a city I can tolerate (and may even like). This city is, I will add, 3 times closer to Derpville than our current home, thus meeting the terms of our original contract.

Still, it took me much hand-wringing before I accepted the offer. I didn’t want to turn my back on academic research. I didn’t want to invalidate how hard I busted my ass in order to get publications out, to make contacts, to give talks to conferences, etc. But, ultimately I took the job offer. It is a good, stable job which will allow a lot of time for me to hang out with my family. I will have my evenings and weekends to do with as I please, and I can largely leave my work at work. Also the pay is almost exactly twice the average starting salary for an assistant professor in the geosciences.  Immediately after sending the email which said I accepted the job in industry I had the overwhelming feeling that I had made the right choice. Life was good. I started planning what to do with all the cash, and to dream of an early retirement. My wife was bummed that we weren’t ending up back in Derpville, but she was OK.  

24 hours later, my wife and I learned that, indeed, Dr. X of Derp State is retiring, and they are probably looking for a replacement in his(my) specialty. Derp State is pretty low-profile, and my sense is that my credentials/publication record are sufficient to be competitive for the job, even sans post-Doc. If I don’t apply for this job my wife will never forgive me. So, the decision I thought was made now has to be made all over again. The thick academic job application I thought I had avoided now has to be written.

I honestly think I have it in me to do the academic thing if I had to. I understand the grant writing process, the publication process, the tenure process, etc. I am just no longer as sure as I once was that I would enjoy it. Sure I love (passionately love)fieldwork, but I understand how hard it is to get funding for field-based geology. I am a pretty good teacher, and I am interested in the pedagogy of teaching science. That being said teaching has never driven me the way I see it driving some of my peers.
But living in Derpville would be good for my marriage, and good for my kids as they could have grandparents around. It would be good for me personally, because having my in-laws around means free babysitting, which means more of a social life for yours truly.

So, finally, my questions:

* Derp State has a two classes a semester teaching expectation from all faculty. How much of my life would I expect to spend teaching/grading/prepping?

* Approximately how many hours does an assistant professor put in every week, between teaching/advising and researching? Are the people that work 60-70 hour weeks doing it out of passion or out of stress-induced frenzy?

* (Optional) Knowing what you know now, what would you do if you were in my shoes?

tl/dr: Unbelievably whiny Ph.D. student complaining about have too many job opportunities. 


**EDIT**: Thanks for all the feedback. Yesterday I emailed my old mentor at Derp State. He said told me that the position I am interested in applying for isn't being posted until next fall, so that gives me time to get a start on the industry gig and then re-assess. He also is encouraging about my prospects, but realistic in detailing some hurdles I might have getting hired at that program specifically. My wife and I had a long talk last night. I agreed to at least apply for the job next fall. Honestly, after talking to my old adviser, I do not expect to get the gig (I still think I am competitive, but I am thinking the odds of getting hired are still only 10-25%, depending on the strength of the applicant pool), so it will likely be a non-issue in my career. And if by some fluke I apply and get hired, maybe by that time I will see that Industry isn't that rad after all. I have a strong suspicion I am viewing industry through rose-colored glasses at the moment.

On the other hand, if I apply for the job and don't get it, well at least then my wife will start moving to a place of acceptance about the whole thing.",,False,,t5_2sakj,True,,,True,t3_k0kq5,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/k0kq5/trying_not_to_fuck_up_the_phd_dismount/,

I went into college in a pretty good situation. I came out of high school with declining but decent grades, enough to get into a good university on scholarships. I also entered the ROTC program to get my school completely paid for and because I was interested in serving. Because I've always been ""gifted"" I felt like going into medicine would be the best way to apply myself in a career.

Now, two years of a terrible lack of focus and work ethic later, I'm sitting on about a 2.4 GPA. That's about a full point lower than what I know I need to even start to be competitive. I know I can do that well when I apply myself, and after the angst of realizing what a piece of shit I've been I'm ready to do the work, but I really think I've just screwed myself beyond all hope. I tell people close to me I'm staying on track, but as far as I know the track currently leads right into a wall. At this rate I'll graduate having just barely gotten a Biology degree, which I don't have any idea how to capitalize on without med school. I'll have the Army right out of college, but I'm really not very ""hooah"" and wasn't planning on making a long career out of it, especially since with my situation I'll end up somewhere like Transportation branch.

Thing is I have no idea what else to shoot for. For years I've been built up for the best, and never really given thought to what I might do if that didn't work out. My counselor, well aware of my grades, has been really wishy-washy about whether I should even keep on the pre-med track, telling me shit like ""well it's up to you"" when all I want is some advice from someone, because I really have no clue. CS and engineering would interest me, but I'm not sure I can switch to those at this point partly because I'm kind of tied down by this ROTC contract and my school has practically no engineering or CS. Psychology interests me, and in fact I'd been thinking of going for Psychiatry in med school. I could still switch to that major, but I'm not sure I have the interpersonal skills for clinical work and I have no idea what other profitable fields are out there.

I thought I wanted to be a chemist at first, but I couldn't find any problems that set my heart a flutter with jealousy that I wasn't working on that problem yet.

I'm in grad school now and I think back to that lecture a lot. I'm just hoping to find his name so that I can send him an email and say thanks. 

I can't remember much about him though. He didn't have a wet lab, so he may have been retired and just doing outreach.

I was an idiot earlier in my career and it's ended up with me having about a 2.8. I am horribly ashamed... I'm interested in animal nutrition with the end goal to go to grad school and maybe beyond in comparative nutrition research. I've really only found my love of research in the past couple years yet my GPA is shit. My nutrition GPA is decent at about a 3.5 and I've been able to get a ton of research experience. I know that I may have screwed myself over early in undergrad. I'll be a late graduate because of a major change but how the hell do I fix this? Would everyone suggest coming back and fixing the GPA or just take the GRE and attempt to go into industry? I just hate that I feel like I found my passion too late and don't know what to do....

EDIT [Goals]: Ideally want to work in zoo nutrition. Preferably in an actual zoo although both academia at the university level or industry like Mazuri both spark my interest. At the moment it's a small industry but has been very steadily growing now that the zoo vet industry has finally caught up to being preventative vs reactive, vets and others are starting to see how lacking our knowledge is and how using a bovid for a base for a Giraffe just isn't cutting it any more. 

EDIT [Authorship Question]: How much does it help to be published before applying? I have a fairly decent chance to be like last author on a industry research project that I am compiling all the data for but has been banging out the details of what data they want collected since before the beginning of this year. I also might get the chance at doing a research project on my own this summer at my internship. If it happens the end result would either be a paper or poster that I could present at a conference. I know the person I work with in the lab has like 6 publications and said that he's talked to an advisor at his undergrad school and they've basically said he would have no problem getting in, he'd be much more advanced than his peers, and it would take much less time to complete due to that. So is that just a fluke or how much does being published beforehand help?

EDIT [Academic Question]: My major isn't actually nutrition because at my school that doesn't exist so I'm just a plain Animal Science major. BUT our major only requires 1 nutrition course and next semester I'll be on my 13th Nutrition course. One is from outside my major (Human Nutrition) but out of all 13, 10 are at the graduate level (670+). I pretty much have all A's in the graduate level courses except a couple (Horse people are insane) and a few times been the only undergrad in the class and fared well. I know I'm getting repetitive but how much does taking related courses in other majors help show your interest and how much does my performance in the higher level courses help me out?

EDIT: Thank you so much everyone! I posted a couple extra tidbits about me and questions (sorry about the wall of text) but I have so much more self esteem after seeing all your opinions!

I graduated from St. John's College in May and am currently taking some time off before I actually apply to grad school.  (For what it's worth, I'm teaching English in Japan through the JET Program).  During this time I'd like to do a thorough search for any and all graduate programs which focus on my area of interest, namely the philosophy of language.

St. John's was an excellent introduction to philosophy, from the ancients to the moderns.  However, the program is limiting in that, while I do have a background in philosophy in a variety of fields, it lacks a specific focus and a modern, updated vocabulary to help me to properly define my interests.  At least, this is how I feel about it.  Thus, while I'm fascinated by language, particularly the thought of Wittgenstein (with whom I'm quite familiar), Frege, Austin, etc., I'm unaware of the more recent developments in this field.  That is, I really have no idea what's been going on after the middle of the twentieth century.  Therefore I'm uncertain about how to even begin looking for a program, and I feel that ""philosophy of language"" is too vague and general a phrase to actually be helpful to me.  Heck, I'm not even sure if I should pursue a Masters in philosophy to start with or not, since I don't feel that my liberal arts degree has really given me any idea of what academic philosophy is really about.  Moreover, I'm also interested in history and literature, but I have no idea how to factor those into my main interest (Phil. Lang.); my understanding is that MAs and beyond are very specific, since undergrad is really where one ought to have explored their burgeoning interests, and narrowed them down to a particular field.

So if anyone has any advice/pointers regarding finding a program and/or narrowing down my interests, I'd be extremely grateful.  I've got a rather large list of philosophers beginning with Frege up to the last decade or so that I'm going to read through (I won't be applying for a year or so anyways), so hopefully that will help me in my efforts; though I've always felt that primary sources are often rather different in how they teach the reader, than how academia treats of those sources after the fact (by applying certain classifications, fitting them into particular historical/philosophical movements, and so forth).  At this point it also sounds like I'm asking for someone more experienced with the whole grad school application process to advise me on a set of criteria I could use in my research, so if anyone has any pointers there as well, that'd be great.  Typically I've been looking at types of programs offered and geographical location (which I do feel are important criteria), but I can't help but think that I should try to find a specific professor whose research aligns with my own interests.  However, until I really figure out what I want to pursue, I have no idea how to go about finding such a professor.

I'm asking this here because my attention is more focused on grad programs in philosophy rather than applying to grad school in general.  If anyone feels that I would be better served by posting in one of the grad school related subs, let me know and I will happily post there instead.  Thanks for any and all assistance!

I am thinking the likes of MIT, Stanford and Harvard.
This year I have graduated with Bachelor of Engineering in Information Science from a not so well known but still good national university in Japan.
My education was in Japanese language, but since I was not fluent in Japanese when I started my studies in the university, my motivation for study suffered and I only got 2.55 out of 4 GPA (Here I want to say that GPA from japanese universities does not correspond to the same GPA from US univerisities. My GPA of 2.55 is probably more like 3.0 by US standards). My graduation thesis was good though, and I got highest mark for it, I even got a paper in proceedings of a Japanese scientific society conference out of it.

Now, I realize that with such a GPA I can not get admitted to PhD programs in top US universities. Therefore, I made a plan to overcome this problem. I will get a masters of science in computer science in a top university in Australia(It is much easier to get admitted to Australian universities with bad GPA), and since language of instruction there is English, my GPA will correspond to my actual academic potential. Then I will apply for PhD programs in top universities in US, such as Stanford, MIT, and Harvard.
I already got an offer from a top Australian university for two year program of master of science in computer science. It is about 30% research and 70% coursework. I have enough money to pay for it, because I can get a scholarship from my home country in East Europe.

Now, my question is, is the plan that I made the best way for me to achieve my goal? Is there some other way that I don't know about?

I ask because I've been in my lab for 7 weeks now, and the only thing I've really been doing is reading papers.  I scheduled a few trainings I was told to schedule, but other than that there is one grad student and one post doc who are working on the same topics as I am (our group is split by area of research) and one of them rarely comes in (he's applying for jobs and working on proposals so he works from home) while the other is focused on writing papers day in day out.

For a year and a half, I have been adjunct teaching art classes at my alma mader while working part time at a bookstore (which I absolutely love and am not prepared to leave). This had worked out great until low enrollment forced me to stop adjuncting at that school and take up full hours at the bookstore. I have missed out on a semester of teaching and applied for some other adjuncts around the area with no luck, until I got offered a last minute class at a school I haven't taught at before in a subject I am not so confident in. I took the job because I was desperate for some teaching experience (especially at a new school which looks really good). **I have verbally confirmed this job but have not signed any papers yet** and have moved around my schedule at the bookstore to accommodate. Meanwhile, the pervious school needs me for TWO classes (both of which I have already taught and am extremely comfortable with) on days that I don't work at the bookstore. This would be more money, and easier on my schedule. But, IM feeling like I have an obligation to stick with the first school? Im in a position where money an experience are key, so I really don't want to screw this up with either burned bridges or not enough money to pay the bills. Technically I could teach all three classes as they do not pose a time conflict, but I am worried about how this would impact my bookstore job, which has been such a great cushion and opened up a lot of doors for me. WHAT DO I DO? (I kinda just wanna say screw it to the first job and take the later 2, but I know that that could look bad, and add more monotony to my resume)

tldr: have 2 job offers, took the first verbally but signed no papers, would rather take the 2nd offer as I have more experience/would earn more money/would fit better into my schedule. BUT don't want to burn bridges with the first job and put them into a bad position. WHAT DO I DO?

Edit:

Thank you all for your suggestions! I have spoken with my bookstore and they are very willing to accommodate. I have been able to move around some story times and found a sub for part of my hours, allowing me to take both jobs! I will be teaching 3 classes (at 2 universities) and working around 20-25 hours/week at the bookstore.

As a sophomore, I've found the sub-field I'm interested. It's new (2006), but certainly available in places I'd be looking. 

If I did my grad studies here, I know who I would work with. He does a lot of research, has a group of about 5 people (which I prefer that over a manager/large group situation). He's also a pretty nice guy, someone I would enjoy working with.

There's also no bias against doing your grad studies at the same place you got your undergrad degree from in the field I'm interested in.

My question to you then: does this sound like a good idea to do my grad studies here?

I have a few more courses to take before I finish, but I'm not sure if I should take courses that touch on subjects that I skipped over in undergrad (solid state physics, control theory, etc.) to help round out my EE education, or if I should take courses that go into more depth of what I already know (communications, signal processing, etc.).  In other words, should I tailor my Master’s degree to give me more breadth of the field, or more depth?  

Right now, I'm leaning more towards the breadth side and holding out going into depth until I look at a PhD program.  Or is this the wrong strategy?
