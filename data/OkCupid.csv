I don't recognize her from OKcupid or Pof though. And this girl is grilling this poor guy. I feel bad for him. 

First she goes on some homophobic rant asking why he lives in the gay district (lots of people live there because it's cheaper).

She: Where do you live?

He: Charles

She: Charles what's Charles?

He: It's South downtown

She: There's a Charles STREET. Do you live there?

He: Yeah

She: That's where all the... uh... the uh... different people live.

...and then she's just firing off question after question... these are only a FEW of the excerpts of intense grilling...

She: So have you dated people online?

He: This is actually my first date in 5 months.

She: Why do so many guys say that. I was just dating a few other guys saying I haven't dated for 3 months, 6 
months, 1 year. You don't look nervous? Are you nervous? You don't seem it.

He: ...uhm..

She: So you're Brazilian?

He: Yes..

She: You don't look Brazilian. You look like you're something else.

He: Well my dad is Japanese and my mom is Italian. 

She: I knew there was something! Cuz I have a friend who is Brazilian and you don't even look Brazilian...

He: But I was born and raised in Brazil..

She: But still. I was asking about your nationality.

*...*

She: So Brazil there's a lot of sex there?

He: uh..not really..

She: Yeah there's a lot

He: a little

She: like on the beach and stuff

He: It's not unheard of..

She: The only thing is you have to be careful and stuff..

He: ..careful?

She: Yeah of the men. There's a lot of women who are really men.

He: laughs

She: No really the same happens in Thailand. Lots of girls people have sex with turn out to be men.

*...*

She: How long were you with your ex?

He: 9 years 

She: 9 years! (the kid looks like he's early 20s so I was surprised too)

He: Yeah but we're just friends now.

She: So you still talk?

He: Well yeah it was 9 years ...so..

She: So you still talk. Hm. Interesting.



*...*



She: So you're like a software developer?

He: Yeah it's like.. uh..

She: .. Not nerdy?

He: Uh yeah.. but a lot of computer work

She: Did they accept your education here?

He: Yeah

She: Really because usually when people come from a different country they have to start all over.

*....*

She: So you're dad is Japanese?

He: Yeah.

She: Like totally Japanese?

He: Yeah

She: Like the ones I see in the movies?

He: Yeah like fully Japanese.

She: So do you eat sushi?

He: No

She: I love sushi. My mom says I should marry a Japanese guy because I eat so much sushi.

He: I'm not that big of a fan.

She: So then what do you EAT?

*...*

**UPDATES:**

She: There's a lot of software developpers here.. they're kind of weird... late at night.. minimal life.. they're like a cult.

He: hmm

She: Its not good you need a balance right?

He: (he must be embarrased cuz I can't hear a single thing he's saying now but she's loud)

*...*

She: It's not difficult for me to get a job. I'm glad I went to school for business. Keeps doors open.

He.   *muttering*

She: [goes through her day.. shopping/business..]

*...*

She: so yeah do you like the site?

He: What site?

She: Dating site?

He: ..mutters something about problems with filters (lol, how they working for you buddy??)

She: So what are you looking for then?

He: Common interests

She: Like swimmers?

He: Uh.. yeah I like swimming

She: lots of swimmers live here.

He: oh

SHe: My bf would love swimming i'd be like ""yeah go have fun"" ..and like i can go shopping while he does it..

*...*

She : I think you got to find someone with commonality and physical attraction

He: yeah

She: thats imporant right? physicallity? attraction? IT IS! Right?

He: yeah

She: and then other stuff.. nice guy.. sense of humour.. likes animals. Someone who is independent has their own 
place. Good job good career. Good family. Stuff liek that. 

He: Someone who cares about the same things?

She: Yeah. Definitely! Like someone with values and morals.

*...*


Dude's handling it like a champ. He knows this ain't no job interview. Relax.



.. it took 30 minutes but he finally made her chuckle once. I missed the joke though.



This shit is happening too fast to type.. if anything more comes out I'll update..


*...*


She: This city is hard to find good guys

he: what do you mean?

she: like gentleman.. someoen who treats you right

he: how?

she: like holds doors for you. you don't see that. 

he: well there some guys to meet.

she: no like a guy should pick up the girl

he: well..

she: no you're mom should have told you that. i'm not dating someone who takes the bus . I want someone on my level. i'm a girl. i think a guy would be very similar. 

*....*

she: girls should not be paying

he: well half half is best

she: no.. thats not how it works

he: ok

she: you asked me out.. so that means you're paying. If i asked you out.. I'D be paying

he: ok

she: so if i have a car and you don't, do you expect me to pick you up all the time?

he: no

she: do you think that's fair?

he: no


she: so you're not paying for gas either.. so is that fair?

he: no

she: that's what I thought. Even though we're girls .. we need to be treated like women. we need to be treated like your sister.


he: [he makes a case about how two people should be equal.. can't hear it all..]

she: 50/50.. that's what i said. But if you invite someone to dinner man should pay

he: no it should be 50/50

she: no you are so wrong! you know why women pay half? because they 'll never want to see that guy again. my brother, my ex-bf.. everyone says the same thing. A real man must be a gentleman and pay.

he: no not always

she: not always.. but if you invite her you MUST pay. I know a lot of girls who will bounce if you don't

he: well the girl should help. 

she: [laughs at him] 

he : its like women rights

she's : its not about women rgiths. its about treating a women

he"": no cuz then a man has to buy everything like a car and a house..

she: no both people should have cars

he: so...

she: if you ask a girl out and dont pay.. i cant believe this is the mentality you guys have... you've been brainwashed... look 90% of the time she'll leave

he: what do you mean ""you guys"" i'll pay sometimes

she: no this the mentality you have.. flowers? you not going to buy flowers now? omg they'll die what a waste of tiem...[laughs at him]... 

OMG THEY BOTH STOOD UP AND ARE DEBATING THIS SHIT OUT LOUD

he: no its about  50/50 

she: 50/50 is everything and between.. like 2 cars .. you're not a man and not being a gentleman.. I am SHOCKED SHOCKED that you even think this way!

he: i am a gentleman

she: no you think woman are dirt.. admit it.. you think they're dirt

he: no i never said that

..NOW THEY WALKED OUTSIDE AND ARE DEBATING THIS THERE..  the guy beside me looked at me and was like ""i never heard so many fucking generalizations in an hour.. that guy needs a medal putting up with that shit.""

Now we're waiting to see if she hits him.... shit got so intense! but I can't hear anything 


Ok now they separated. Didn't see a slap like we expected. But it did get scary. Sorry about the grammar but at the end it became like rapid fire back and forth and could only type the best parts as fast as I could.

Irony was the dude was pretty much the gentleman. I don't blame him for losing it a bit in the end and letting her make him lose his cool. He's probably thinking he went along letting her spew garbage and now he's being called ""dirt"" in a coffee shop. About 20 people here. I hope most of them knew what it was about.",,False,self,t5_2rct2,1361212865.0,,,True,t3_18qghf,http://www.reddit.com/r/OkCupid/comments/18qghf/im_at_the_coffee_shop_and_there_is_a_first_date/,

But sometimes, people on OkCupid turn out to be not who they say they are, and they have other things in mind.

Over the weekend, I was sexually assaulted by someone on OkCupid. I sent a note about it to the staff, but I wanted to talk about it here. Just to say, the guy presented so normal -- and I have a high creeper meter. He came off as friendly, a little doofy, good with animals. We had a first date that went really well, had a few drinks on Friday.

Saturday night he invited me out again, and because I'd had such a good time, I agreed. Except I made the really fucking stupid mistake of leaving him alone with my soda, and the rest is, well, you can guess. I learned my lesson not to be so fucking stupid, and I really, REALLY hope all of you will take this as a brief reminder to please, PLEASE be safe. I don't want what happened to me to happen to any of you wonderful people.

Yes, I contacted the police, and yes, I've done what I can. The name he gave me wasn't his real name. I'm not surprised. And his profile is now gone, meaning that I can't even take his picture and put it anywhere.

1359184096.0,501,self.OkCupid,17b11c,Went on an OkCupid date last night. It was awful.,585,84,331,http://www.reddit.com/r/OkCupid/comments/17b11c/went_on_an_okcupid_date_last_night_it_was_awful/,"I'd been messaging/texting a guy from OkCupid for the last week and we agreed to meet up last night. 

When I showed up he seemed great. He was nice and friendly, told me how pretty I looked etc. and we settled into a quiet little bar for some drinks and to chat. 

As soon as we started chatting it became evident he had a very specific life plan and was basically looking for a wife on OkCupid (which is fine if that's what you want). He began asking for my opinions on shared bank accounts and how long I thought people should be together before they got married. It was a bit awkward, but I went with it and basically gave him my opinion on the things he was asking. 

He started telling me all about how he's *really* into martial arts (which is fine) and how he'd want 'his kids' to get into it too, and then started asking about whether my parents were still married and what my views on divorce were. 

So far, it's awkward and feels like I'm being interviewed for the position of wife, but I'm not really thinking he's a weirdo. 

Then, out of nowhere, he says 'You can *have* kids, right?' - which is, in my opinion, a totally inappropriate question to ask someone on a first date. But, I answered honestly that I have Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), and that while I can conceive it *may* be more difficult for me. Given that it was the first time we met, I didn't feel he needed any more personal information on the matter. 

Things instantly changed. He said, 'Yeah, that's probably gonna be an issue for me - I'm looking for someone who is all good down there'. 

&gt;*All good down there..........*

I was absolutely blown away by how callous his response was. I get that for some people, potential fertility problems are a deal breaker, but I don't think it's kind or appropriate to tell the person then and there - in the middle of a bar.  

I put a $20 on the table, said 'Well, I hope you find the uterus you're looking for' and excused myself. 

About an hour later I got a text message saying, 'I hope I didn't hurt your feelings, I just don't want to gamble with these thing '. I didn't reply. 

That's it pretty much - but it left me feeling like shit. ",,False,self,t5_2rct2,False,,,True,t3_17b11c,http://www.reddit.com/r/OkCupid/comments/17b11c/went_on_an_okcupid_date_last_night_it_was_awful/,

Anways he asked to meet and work on the boss fight together. It was an interesting request and very different from other messages I got. I thought ""why the fuck not?"" So I picked Shake shack. He paid for my meal since I was helping him. We literally worked on the boss fight for the majority of the time. We did end up chit chatting about different things and having stuff in common. At the end we both said we had a good time and I said casually we'll do this again. The date felt really awkward and I felt no chemistry. I had no intention of seeing him again even though I said I would. So a few days later he texts me asking to go out. I decided ""why not? I should just give him another chance.""

So for the second date we ended up getting drinks and dinner and then watch Pacific rim. For some reason this time everything felt different. The drinks opened us up a little more and I had changed my mind about him completely. There now was chemistry. He walked me to my door after the date and kissed me. :-) We made plans to see each other again.

Last night was our 3rd date. He picked me up and gave me a single red rose. He took me to a fancy italian restaurant. We spent 20 minutes consulting with the waiter about which bottle of red wine to order. After that we discussed our future plans in life and interests. We talked about the videogames that we can play over and over again and never get sick of them. After dinner we went to a dive bar and got drinks and talked more. Then we walked to his car and then proceeded to makeout against the car for sometime and everything clicked for me chemistry wise. 

I'm pretty happy :). We're planning our 4th date on friday and I can't wait. I'm really glad I gave him a second chance :-).

**EDIT UPDATE**

He came over last night and we went and got a bottle of wine, went to my place and netflixed a ""bad"" movie and cuddled on my bed :)

Me: Hey! It's good to meet you.

&gt; Him: You know you're wearing a lot of eye makeup, right?

----

&gt; Him: I wrote a book that's coming out soon.

Me: Oh that's neat, I'd like to read it. I just had a short story published.

&gt; Him: I don't want to read it. I'm sorry, but it's probably bullshit.

----

&gt; Him: Not to sound egotistical, but I'm a literal genius.

----

&gt; Him: Are you wearing makeup on your eyebrows?

Me: Yeah, just a little bit to darken and fill them in.

&gt; Him: Wow, that's fucking weird. It looks like shit.

**[Proceeds to reach across the bar and rub one of my eyebrows]**

----

&gt;Him: I'm not very good at giving compliments, sorry.

Me: Yeah, I guess I noticed that. It's okay.

&gt;Him: It's just that pretty girls are like cats and if you give them attention, they hate you but if you ignore them or say 'fuck you, cat', they'll be rubbing all over your pants.

----

&gt; Him: You know, if you ever want to make out with me, you should just say so.

Me: Noted.

----

So this whole time I'm drinking just to make the whole process bearable when I should have just went home. Anyway, I ended up having one too many and spent the remainder of the night vomiting up colored alcohol. That was some narcissistic bullshit. Nobody do any of these things. Ever.

**Edit #1:** Formatting.

**Edit #2:** I really appreciate all of you taking the time to write down your thoughts on this and related topics (emergency dating apps, etc). I was feeling a little weird about the whole thing. I knew it was a bad date, but I think I only realized it on a lower level and posting it here to get some feedback/share what happened has been really validating. I'm going to keep all of this in mind the next time (hopefully not soon) I'm in a similar situation - that hey, it's okay to leave. I don't have to sit there and chug 8 drinks just to get through it. That's crap. So thank you.

**Edit #3:** OkCupid claimed we're a 94% match on top of being 84% friends with only a 5% enemy rating.

**Edit #4:** Just got a text from him asking me out again this weekend. Yep.

**LAST EDIT FOREVER: Told him I didn't think we were very compatible and that I did not want to go out again, but thank you. He responded with ""You're probably right about that :)"". Yes. Yes I am.

1364299006.0,436,self.OkCupid,1b1bne,My most recent and most likely last OkCupid experience.,514,78,226,http://www.reddit.com/r/OkCupid/comments/1b1bne/my_most_recent_and_most_likely_last_okcupid/,"Let me preface this by saying I'm not an amazing story teller, but this had to be shared.    

So in late January I have a week long texting conversation and really seem to hit it off with a beautiful, smart, nerdy girl I've messaged on OkCupid. I'm a bit of a closet nerd and don't really show it all too much to people who don't know me so we share a ton of interests. We decide to meet at a local Casino (Vegas residents) and immediately we're having a blast, not a bit of awkwardness or dead air. We end up spending 7 hours wandering aimlessly while we talk about everything. Family, Friends, Goals, Job, etc. It progresses from there into a second date, a third date, a forth date and so on.    

I meet all her friends, which consist of a massive group of the extremely social awkward. I can see why she says she strictly dates outside her social circle. Not a big deal, I can get along with mostly everyone and at least find a way to relate to most people on some level. She lives in a house with about 6 other people. Ranging from bronies to definite aspergers cases. The 2 Couples in the house seem to really like me, and one other single boring awkward guy who really doesn't interact with me or anyone at all much.   

So this progresses onward for the next month or so. We go on about 5 or 6 Dinner dates, I come over to her house after work and watch movies and hang out with her alone, or her roommates and friends and cuddle, all that jazz, etc. We speak daily via text, always a good morning, a good night. It seems like it's going places but wasn't quite at the ""exclusive talk"".    

All of a sudden she begins getting a bit vague in texts, cancels a planned night out due to ""allergies and sleep deprivation"". She tells me I should just come by some night after work this week. No biggie.  
Day or so later I ask her what night she'd like me to come by. No response. I'm not one to push at it so another day or so passes and I haven't talked to her so I shoot her a simple message to see whats up. No response.  
I see her posting invites to some ""secret surprise spur of the moment"" party that no one has a clue what is. I'm at work and don't bother to attempt to even ask her about it.    

Three hours later on Facebook pictures of her in a wedding dress and  a picture of a bouquet are posted and made into her display picture and cover photo. All her friends congratulating her and saying she's so ""random"". She literally got married. Remember that single guy roommate that I mentioned earlier? Yeah that's now her husband as of a few hours ago. She never really mentioned him as anything more than her roommate or even mentioned him much at all when we spoke of exes or past hookups. So she got married about 5 days after we saw each other last.  
I shot her a text basically with a ""wtf?!"" and have yet to get a response.

I definitely should not have gotten into this situation to begin with.  Having said that, here's what happened. 

I had been talking to this girl for a while, both on OKC and facebook.  We were having trouble finding a time to meet.  Finally, we decided earlier this week that we were going to meet.  I'm a musician, and I had a gig last night, so we decided to meet after that.  I felt like I knew this girl pretty well after some pretty long conversations spanning about 2 weeks, and we both were fairly avid cannabis users, so we decided to just meet somewhere and smoke.  

I get to the parking lot where we agreed to meet and jump in her car.  We smoke, and we're not exactly hitting it off.  (I have this thing where when I get high, I can't shut the fuck up. This is clearly turning her off.) I had pretty bad cottonmouth, so I suggest we go get something to drink.  We go to this convenience store and she decides she's going to wait in her car.  I run in, grab a drink, come out and she is gone.  She made off with an 1/8th of weed, my bubbler, and my fucking car keys.  

It's 11:30, and I'm all kinds of fucked. I walked back to my car, it's fucking pouring rain, I'm 30 minutes from my house, and I find that one of my fucking windows was open. I get in my car (thankfully I left it unlocked), and try to get in touch with her.  The rain is soaking me though my cracked window and I'm fucking freezing. She won't answer my calls or texts, I tried to send her a facebook message, but she just unfriended and blocked me.  I thought about sending her an okcupid message (she was online), but it's hard enough to get girls to respond even before they rob you, amirite? 

So, like a drunk fucking teenager, I call my mom and ask her to come and drop off my spare key.  Not my proudest moment. 

Edit:  She dropped the keys off at a nearby(near her, far as fuck from me) grocery store and had them call me. I guess I feel ""lucky,"" but it definitely still sucks.  u/CaptCurmudgeon's comment sums it up nicely.  I'm out ~$100, but I learned some very valuable lessons and a little bit of humility.  

As fun as it is to think about some ""petty revenge"" and other retaliatory fantasies, I think I'll just let this one go.  Still, I hope terrible things happen to her. 

Edit #2:  Thanks to everyone who offered advice and supportive/kind words! You guys have really helped me feel a bit better.  For the record, I did not drive stoned, and I never planned to.

I don't do that bad in the real world but on okcupid I feel like a leper.

Then I come on here and I see all the [girl redditors claiming how hard they have it and that they don't get responses, too](http://www.reddit.com/r/OkCupid/comments/19ltk9/the_prevailing_assumptions_that_1_women_are/). Oh sorry you get a 50% response rate. Mine's 1% but you're right you have it rough, too.

It's like women just can't even fathom how different the landscape is for guys on okcupid. But it's not their fault, they're just treated differently so they're not aware of their entitledment.

Then I realized, oh man, this is what white privilege must be like! It's not my fault I'm white. I'm not rich and I've worked hard for everything I've ever gotten. But maybe minorities and women have it even worse for reasons that I'm unable to discern.

So thank you okcupid and r/okcupid for teaching me a valuable lesson about social equality!

Either that or I'm just hideous and white privilege is bullshit.

This isn't to say that all LOL FOR SCIENCE posts are boring. There was one recently that showed the breakdown of views/messages to a Super Hot Girl vs Attractive Girl vs Homely Girl vs Pretty and Fat Girl. That shit was interesting. So go ahead and post those. Just be damn sure they're worthwhile.

Also, fat people know they're fat. Shut up about it. They know the benefits of losing weight. This is not a weight loss subreddit. Go give your unsolicited, obvious advice elsewhere ty.

1343060636.0,224,self.OkCupid,x0sof,Some advice from a 30 year old man who has been on and off OKC since 2004,266,42,81,http://www.reddit.com/r/OkCupid/comments/x0sof/some_advice_from_a_30_year_old_man_who_has_been/,"I wanted to take some time and offer some advice from the perspective of someone who has been on the site since it opened in 2004. I don't claim to be a ""professional"" when it comes to online dating, but I'd say I've had quite a bit of ""success"" on the site and learned a lot over the years.

I've met several serious long term girlfriends (one of which was a fiancee at one point), a bunch of short-term (2-6 month) relationships, LOTS of first dates, and a few flings along the way for good measure.

The first and most important tip I want to give is this:

**If you wrote a good message and she didn't reply, don't take it personally**

I know this one is hard, and after a long drought of non-replies it can start to grate on your self-esteem. That said, there are LOTs of reasons she might not have replied to you.

For instance, when I've gone on a couple of dates with a women I'm interested, I often stop replying to new messages sent to me. Even if she's cute and interesting, I typically try to focus my attention on one person at a time. This is pretty typical among women as well.

To those that feel that women owe you at least a rejection note back, understand that most probably DID do this at first, but due to a shocking amount of butthurt replies to their rejections, they've just played it safe and stopped replying. This is simply the convention of online dating - don't take it personally.

**There is an ebb and flow of activity based on the time of year**

The ""best"" time for online dating is typically spring and early summer. People want to get out and have fun, and that's when the site is typically most active. If you're starting out in the dead of winter, and there isn't much activity, don't get discouraged.

**Timing is everything**

Based on the first two points here - if she's been on the site for more than 2 weeks, and is moderately attractive, she's already been on at LEAST one date, and is probably already sort of seeing someone. Keep an eye on who's new in addition to just match percentages.

**Don't let the red dot discourage you**

Most of the people I message have the dreaded red dot on their profile indicating that they ""rarely reply"". Most of the time this isn't necessarily their fault - they just get lots of shitty one-liner messages. The more attractive the women, it's almost guaranteed she'll have a red dot regardless of how many good messages she replies to.

**Start a conversation, not an interrogation**

When writing a first message, try to start a *conversation*. Give her easy questions to reply to, but don't interrogate her. Also don't forget to tell her about yourself as well. If you ask her an easy question like ""What's your favourite horror movie?"", follow it up with something like ""I really loved Blair Witch Project because...."". This is a conversation starter - it gives her something to reply to that's easy, and potentially something to ask you back that's related to what you shared.

Also, it's common advice, but always refer to things in her profile. Avoid compliments about her attractiveness - they probably get this a lot and it's lazy. If you're going to compliment something about her appearance, make sure it's a conversation opener. ""Hey, I really like that tattoo of a bluebird - the art is fantastic. Is that your design, or did you have someone draw it for you? I've been thinking about getting one on my thigh...""

Keep it relatively short. She should be able to read it and feel like she could reply right away without having to sit on it and dwell on how much work it'll be to respond to your essay. Keep it to 3 or 4 points and wrap it up.

**Don't write a novel in your profile, avoid generic fluff, avoid demands**

There is a balance between writing too much, and too little. Avoid generic bullshit about how you like travel, music, movies - everyone likes this stuff. Be more specific, don't be afraid to talk about niche things you're into.

Don't write demands or passive aggressive accusatory crap in your profile either. Stuff like ""If you smoke, don't message me"", or ""I want a woman who isn't superficial"" makes you sound like a jaded dick even if she doesn't smoke or isn't superficial. Your match questions will take care of stuff like this.

Don't talk about how you're funny or witty. Simply BE funny or witty.

My main summary is in point form. Short, snappy sentences that are easy to skim and give a quick overview of my personality (geeky, sarcastic, funny etc)

**Look happy in your profile pictures**

Unless you're crazy attractive, smile and look comfortable in your photos. Most people who try to pull off the ""thoughtful"" or ""deep and contemplative"" pose just look depressed. Try to get photos of you out and doing things. A bunch of webcam headshots with a gloomy look on your face (that you're trying to play off as ""looking cool"") aren't the best. Avoid webcam shots in dim or dark rooms too.

Happy people want to be with other happy people.

If you have a pet, pose with it. It's a great way to attract a dog or cat lover and a great ice breaker.

**Arrange to meet after a handful of messages**

Do NOT spend weeks in messages back and forth. It's tedious and a waste of time. A small handful of back and forth is more than enough to establish that she's interested. If she declines, she probably isn't that serious about meeting someone or simply isn't that interested and is just being polite. That can vary a lot from person to person, but in general I've had very little trouble arranging meetings after a short handful of messages.

In my early days I tried to move the conversation to IMs and talked on there for a while before meeting, but, again, in my experience it's a lot easier to just go meet up. This might be something that is easier to do with women in their mid-20s and older. Younger women may be more wary of meeting up, so depending on your age, your milage may vary.

Avoid asking for her phone number until you have a first date planned. Don't ask for her Facebook or anything like that either. I find this can come across as creepy and intrusive. Then again, this could be a generational thing too. I find young 20 somethings are far more loose and open with who they friend on Facebook.

**If you have a typical 9-5 job, meet over lunch if you can**

This is my one dating pro-tip I can offer. The weekday lunch date is the best first date because it has a time limit. You have around an hour to dip out of work and grab a bite. If there's no chemistry, it's an easy out and no one has to feel awkward with the ""wheeeeeeeeelp... I need to get, uh, going... because.... ""

If it goes really well, it leaves you both wanting more which is a great setup for a second date :)

**Don't Give Up!**

Take a break if you need to, but don't swear off online dating after a few weeks. People come and go from the site all the time, and you never know who you will meet. I've met tons of awesome people on the site over the years, and while most of them didn't turn into long term relationships, that's OK! It was still a worthwhile experience, and I'm often better off for having known them :)

Try to stay positive!

1338826965.0,213,self.OkCupid,ukdtp,Stood up for the first time; made the most of it,245,32,64,http://www.reddit.com/r/OkCupid/comments/ukdtp/stood_up_for_the_first_time_made_the_most_of_it/,"I was stood up for the first time last week. I don’t mean she canceled at the last minute—I mean she just didn’t show and I haven’t heard from her since. I’ve read complaints here on r/OkCupid about this happening, but I’ve been meeting people online for a while (nearly 80 women—should post about that!), and this is the first time I’ve been stood up.

So I made the most of it. I went across the street from the park where I’d been waiting to a bar that was going to have live music in a little while, grabbed a table, and ordered a beer. About ten minutes later, a woman came in by herself and sat down in a chair about 15 feet to my left. As I drank my beer, I noticed that she was checking her phone and occasionally looking around. I resolved that when I finished my drink, I’d go over and introduce myself; then I did. I asked her if she was meeting someone.

It turned out she had been stood up as well, though by an old friend, not an online date. She’s a flight attendant, nominally based here in Boston but actually living somewhere else, so this was a new place for her. After talking for about an hour, we left to walk around and find something else to do. Eventually we made our way to one of my favorite restaurants, a little Tunisian place hidden on a side street. Then I drove her home, and we made plans for the next day.

She’d said she wanted to get out of the city and see the surrounding area. But she’d be on call for work from 3 AM to 3 PM and couldn’t go too far from the airport during that span. So we agreed that if she wasn’t called up then she’d let me know, I’d pick her up, and we’d head *somewhere*. She called me a bit before 3 PM, and we headed north to check out the coast of New Hampshire and southern Maine. We explored for seven hours, and during that time the conversation never flagged. When I dropped her off back at her house by the airport, we both agreed we’d had an amazing time, and she said she’d let me know when she’d be back in town. She got a call at 3:45 AM the next morning to fly out. Now I’m wondering when (if?) I’ll hear from her again. I like her.

Why did I post this whole story here, even though we didn’t meet on OKC? Two reasons:

* It’s important to remember that when someone doesn’t respond, or stops responding, or doesn’t show up, that’s not the end of the world. There are always more people out there, and some of them are better for you than the person who blew you off.

* If it weren’t for all my practice with OKCupid, I wouldn’t have had the confidence to approach a random person in a bar, nor necessarily the ability to show her a spontaneous good time. Dating encompasses several skills, and all of our failures and partial successes are making us better at those skills. None of it is a loss.

I’m really looking forward to seeing her again, but for now I have two OKCupid dates scheduled for this week. Don’t give up :-)",,False,self,t5_2rct2,1338913908.0,,,True,t3_ukdtp,http://www.reddit.com/r/OkCupid/comments/ukdtp/stood_up_for_the_first_time_made_the_most_of_it/,

That’s how she described me in her text to her friends on our first date. Through a common interest in Gordon Ramsay, we began our back and forth getting to know you on OKC. The question game was a main feature and an unexpected asset in determining how likely we were to tolerate each other. After about 3 days of this, and then texting I finally asked to meet her. She suggested a bar about half way between us both, that featured retro video games and artisan craft beers (how much more hipster can you get?). She had warned me multiple times that she wasn’t very attractive, despite her posted pictures saying otherwise. When I left work the afternoon before our date, I got there a little early as I wasn’t familiar with the area, and didn’t want to risk being late. Not soon after I sat down, she walked in apparently with the same agenda. Luckily, I knew it was her right away. Her pictures didn’t do her justice, her warnings were unfounded, and I felt a warm smile grow on my face as she sat down next to me. With a bourbon already in hand, I offered her a drink. She chose a dark ale.

After our first drink we meandered around the bar looking for potential games to play, and stepped outside for some air. I looked at the sky and realized that I may be in luck with a clear night. With the help of an app on my phone I was able to show her a brilliant Iridium Flare, a feat that did not go unnoticed to the people around us; they were equally impressed.

We returned inside for another drink and more conversation. I nearly blew it at this point by asking some uncomfortable questions because I’m stupid and socially awkward. But in my apologetic state she did something I’ll never forget. She grabbed my shirt, pulled me toward her, and kissed me.

“So things aren’t so bad after all...” I thought. I asked her go on a short walk with me to my car, as I had something for her. She had known prior to getting together that I had brought something, but she wasn’t sure what it was; only that I was “positive she’d like it”. I opened my car door, and retrieved the special item.

“My former boss has a wife who over the years has received numerous perks from pharmaceutical companies…cotton ball containers, clipboards, beer cozies, and so on,” I explained. “When you mentioned you had broken something of yours I was reminded that I had two of these and felt that I could help you out.”

From behind my back I presented her a small coffee press. Admittedly, a kitchen appliance with an allergy drug’s name strewn across it isn’t exactly flowers, but I was confident that I was doing right. And I’m happy to say it did.  We agreed to meet again the following Wednesday for Master Chef and Chinese Take-Out at her place.

I had some female friends at work tell me ""you gotta try online dating"" and I'm telling them ""no way, that stuff isn't for me!""   So of course as soon as I get home I start a profile on OKC.
I started getting responses pretty quickly and some of the women I messaged seemed to be pretty cool. I went on a few dates, the women were nice but nothing seemed to click.
Then about 5 months ago, I met up with a woman at a downtown bar...wow, as soon as I saw her I was hooked, she was fucking gorgeous.
We hung out and had a few drinks, talked and laughed a lot.  We ended up walking around downtown and really seemed to hit it off nicely. I ended up asking her out again and she accepted right away.
Flash forward 5 months, we've been going out 2-3 times a week and talk on the phone or text all the time.  I truly believe I met ""the one!""
Anyway..going shopping for a ring today...I hope she says ""yes!""

1350888211.0,207,self.OkCupid,11vvn2,on overcoming a sense of entitlement on OKCupid,265,58,206,http://www.reddit.com/r/OkCupid/comments/11vvn2/on_overcoming_a_sense_of_entitlement_on_okcupid/,"My most recent epiphany is that I have a problem with entitlement, which I didn't even realize I had.

When I created my profile, I had ideas about how it would go.  I'm attractive, smart, friendly, easy to talk to, my life is together.  I'm a catch.  I'll get flooded by messages (I'd already heard about how it usually goes for women), I'll choose the best guy out of all of them, and be happily settled down in my next relationship, in no time at all.  Right?

That's not what happened.  Of course not.  You've all been on OKCupid long enough to know just how unrealistic I was being.  But, all my life experience to this point suggested that's how it would be.  I've always gotten attention from guys.  I've never stayed single for long - 3 months was the longest stretch of downtime in between relationships.  If guys pay attention to me, they almost always continue that attention and pursue an actual relationship.  They don't lose interest quickly.  That's how it had always been.  

But what happened was far different.  Yes I got messages, yes I got dates.  But time and time again, after a date or two or three, I'd never hear from them again.  

I was really, very confused.  Why weren't these guys pursuing me?  I'm a catch!  Guys always pursue me!  That's how it's supposed to go!  They aren't supposed to meet me and then easily forget me!  Don't they realize they had a chance with a girl they'd be lucky to have?  What's wrong with them?

If the guy moved on and we hadn't gotten physical, I explained it as ""oh he was just after sex and lost interest when he didn't get it"".  If we had sex and the guy then left, ""Ugh its another asshole just looking to get laid, pretending like he's interested but just wants to cut and run as soon as they get what they want.""  If the guy was younger than me, I'd blame him for treating me like a cougar and not a real person to take seriously.  Etc etc.  

Mostly, I blamed OKCupid, and online dating in general.  Online dating is fucked, I decided.  It gives everyone this disposable mentality, where dates are so easy to line up that people are easily tossed aside if they don't completely wow you on the first impression.  I decided that attractive guys on OKCupid get too much attention and let it go to their head, why settle for just one girl when you could be sleeping with all of Houston?  I decided that the not-top-5% guys end up bitter and hostile towards women, and the top 5% guys turn into players who don't respect women.  

Because clearly, something is wrong with any guy who doesn't want to be with me.  

The truth is a little bit more simple.  I'm not everyone's type.  And I needed to get over myself.  A guy can be a perfectly good, decent, sincere guy, and yet not end up wanting to pursue me.  It doesn't make him a player/misogynist/general asshole, it just means he met me and didn't make the connection he was looking for, for whatever reason.  And the more I was raging out (even inwardly, even unexpressed) against all these guys who weren't falling in love with me, the more of an ass I made of myself.

So I'm trying to fix that now.  I'm trying to go into this with fewer expectations and a little more humility.  I'm trying to not treat guys I meet as representatives of all males on OKCupid.  They don't know what the other guys are doing, and they don't care - men on OKCupid are not some organized committee that moves as a group.  And I'm pretty sure most of them would like to be given fair consideration without being associated with men that I met before them.  

I'm trying to realize that nobody owes me anything, that most meetings do not turn into true love, that my ego can survive without the validation of men pursuing me and in fact it's shitty to expect that somehow I ""deserve"" to always be getting that attention.

This stuff is so obvious that it sounds stupid to say it out loud, especially to admit that it took me until age 30 to figure this out.  Especially because, it's so easy to recognize an obnoxious, bitter sense of entitlement in other people - but it took me this long to figure out I have the same problem, myself.

Well, knowing is half the battle.  I am accepting that I might be single for a while, and although I want to be open to the right guy coming along, I have to stop expecting it or feeling that I deserve it somehow.",,False,self,t5_2rct2,False,,,True,t3_11vvn2,http://www.reddit.com/r/OkCupid/comments/11vvn2/on_overcoming_a_sense_of_entitlement_on_okcupid/,

After all, as a gay man in a small Bible Belt town, the only other way for me to meet guys would be to go to meth labs (gay clubs) or meth labs (gay bars). So, I decided to give OkCupid a shot recently and, much to my surprise, I met a cute Mexican dude that totally met my standards.

So for those of you that have been on OkCupid, you know that there are thousands upon thousands of personality questions which gauge your match percentage to a certain person. So, I leaped over to that and started flipping through a few of them. It was mostly basic shit, asking me questions about who I idolized growing up, did I prefer to be a top or bottom, etc.. However, I eventually stumbled across a question that absolutely blew my mind. It's the kind of question that, if asked on a first date, results in a restraining order. The kind of question that makes you do a spit-take and then sip the beverage off the floor like a dog because all the oxygen is racing out of your brain and you get so dehydrated that you're afraid you'll pass out. The question was:

""If you were having the best sex of your life and your partner asked you to squeak like a dolphin, would you?""

Take a second.

One more.

Ok, good.

There is one positive thing about this: I learned a lot about myself when considering this question. I considered what prerequisites would have to be met for me to... *ehem*... 'squeak like a dolphin.' A lot of folks look back at the time when they discovered their kinks. It's a big moment for a lot of us because of how important our kinks are to us. That was my moment.

And to answer your next question: No, personifying sea creatures is definitely not one of my kinks. As a matter of fact, up until that day, I could think of no bigger boner-killer than the thought of a dolphin creeping into my mind during arousal. But, I'll get back to that a little later.

So anyways...

I finally arrange to meet this dude and we really hit it off. He's just what I like in a guy: short (around 5'5), effeminate, a bit immature, and a bit on the clumsy side. He's what baseball buffs call a Five Tools guy. So once our date is reaching that peak (and by peak, I mean the part where the clothes come off), I am simultaneously reaching mine.

However, one of the worst parts of being a gay man is the stereotype that we're all a bunch of promiscuous hound dogs. And here I am, fulfilling that bullshit stereotype by coming within seconds of plowing this dude without knowing his last name. So, as he's on all fours, ready for me to do my thing, I interject with a question: ""Hey man, what the hell's your last name."" He turned his head back to me with these big, cute puppy-dog eyes.

And at that point, I should've known that whatever he was about to tell me, I was not going to be pleased.

""... Mencia..""

Take a second.

One more.

Ok, good. Now, let me put this in perspective for you.

I was, for the first time in my life, 1000% up for anything. I was willing to indulge in whatever deranged or disparaging kink he fancied. I was even ready to squeak like a fucking dolphin.

I was not, however, ready for ""... Mencia..."".

So here I am, my dick melting in my hand faster than Jell-O in a microwave, but this guy is just too cute and too sweet for me to let that one minor (hah) detail derail this once-in-a-lifetime experience. So, I gave into my urges and soldiered on.

Now, I'm not sure how it is for everyone else, but when I'm having sex, I have images fly through my head at almost warp-speed; not one of them can I nail down. That's probably for the best, because they'd probably be trivial things like (""Goddammit, did I leave the coffee pot on?"") or (""What's gonna happen to Jair Jurrjens when the Orioles get tired of his bullshit?"").

However, this time was a bit different. Nearing my completion, one image slowed down to a sharp halt across my mind. And... goddamn it.

It was Carlos Mencia. That fat, unfunny fuck had invaded my sex thoughts. Remember that one image I mentioned that would be worse to think about during sex than a sea creature? This was it.

How repulsed was I by this? I lost my erectile faculties completely and came right then and there. And when I realized that the last image I saw before ejaculating was Carlos Mencia...

I squeaked like a dolphin.

If you want to message someone who has a full inbox AND you **do not** have A-list here is what you can do:

1. Add said user to your favorites. 
2. Assuming you are using your computer (I don't recall seeing this prompt on the mobile app, though I could be wrong), say that **yes**, you do want to inform him/her that you have added them as a favorite.
3. Go to your outbox - you should see an outgoing message to said user informing him/her that you've added them as a favorite. You can then reply to that very message with whatever outstanding flattery/deuchebaggery you originally had in mind. 

Simple as that. I've done this several times (I'm a guy) to some attractive girls who have full inboxes and received some replies. Let me know how it works out for y'all.

My point is this: If you want to post a success story, it better damn well be a story (AKA text post) talking about how gushy and adorable the two of you are together(or how disdainful you are of one another, I don't know what you guys like), and/or the trials and tribulations you had to go through to reach each other, with your picture(s) linked in the post, NOT JUST A PICTURE OF YOUR FACES WITH NO EXPLANATION.

1368476006.0,173,self.OkCupid,1e9l0a,"Nearly 3 years on OKC, here is what I've learned",205,32,71,http://www.reddit.com/r/OkCupid/comments/1e9l0a/nearly_3_years_on_okc_here_is_what_ive_learned/,"I've been, off and on, the site for nearly 3 years now. I started in July of 2010 and have been learning since. I've been on lots of first dates, in one relationship, and met lots of cool people. I started out insecure, nursing my heart from a bad breakup, and generally lonely in a new town. Over the past 2 years and 10 months I've evolved to a person looking to meet people and have fun. It wasn't easy, but I've become much better at dating through it. Force yourself to be a little uncomfortable, with time the first date jitters will all but disappear. I don't fret meeting up with people now and my lack of nervousness shows. Through many first dates, I've learned things to talk about, questions to ask, and how to be generally fun to be with. Just keep trying and getting out there.


* **Don't take internet dating too serious.** Dating should be fun, don't mistake it for a job application. My first versions of my profile were way too dry and I treated the site as a placement center for a relationship. Nobody wants to be overwhelmed with serious talk of your life goals, motivation for live, and/or talk about the future. Sure, its nice to give little hints, but don't write your essays like you're trying to impress your boss. This goes for messages too. It is harder to reply to serious messages. Make it easy for the other party to talk by being playful and fun.

* **Pictures are the most important part of any profile.** We're all equally shallow. Look good and have flattering photos.

* **Stop being so damn trusting.** I've gone on multiple first dates with girls that involved me driving 30+ miles away from their home and doing hard drugs in an unknown environment. It was fun and all, but you ladies (yes, some of them were redditors and even on r/okc) should have some common sense. 

* **Don't invest in people until they've given you a reason.** Just because a pretty girl likes the same bands and shows as you doesn't mean she's a perfect match. Same goes after a promising first date, if you've only spent a couple hours with someone chances are their shitty side hasn't had the opportunity to come out yet. 

* **Don't hype yourself up about someone.** Same vain as above. I approach every date the same. I'm going to meet someone, who on the surface appears interesting. I tell myself that chances are I won't have a lasting connection with them and that they're likely not the one. When they are, you'll be pleasantly surprised, but will have also vetted them thoroughly to really know they are.

* **If someone is only interested in a platonic relationship, they'll make that clear in the beginning.** I've met lots of friends through OKC and every one of them set the tone of the relationship in the beginning.

* **Don't be afraid of failure.** You'll be rejected, 99% matches won't respond to your witty messages, and you'll take a hit to your ego. Don't worry about it, it's all part of life and dating. All those people are just missing out on the awesome person you are. Sucks for them, not you.

* **Everyone likes to have sex. Well, most everyone.** There isn't any need to remind the other party you want to play with their sexual organs. There are pictures on the site. If they're responsive to your messages, they're interested in you physically (or they'll tell you right away they're not).

* **Get out of your comfort zone.** This is how you grow as a person. I usually wait for the 2nd date to have a more adventurous outing, but go do things that you haven't done before. Pushing your comfort zone shows you the type of person you act like. Doing new stuff make you cynical and mean? Stop being an asshole.

* **Have fun.** Jesus, dating is supposed to be fun. Think of OKC as a chance to meet people you wouldn't normally interact with. Get to know them, find their weird quirks, listen to their stories, and share their ideas. You'll get more comfortable with interacting with people when you remind yourself, you're there to have fun.

* **Set up your boundaries early.** Not the type to text often? Set that expectation early. The longer things go on for, the harder it is to set a new precedent.

* **Plan short first dates.** Be guarded and skeptical of strangers you meet on the internet. Seriously. If things go really well, you'll can keep hanging out with them. There is nothing worse than doing something for 3 hours with a person you've lost interest in within the first 10 minutes of meeting.

* **Constantly change your profile.** New pictures, updates, more questions, and etc. These things keep your profile in the ""relevant"" area and will give you better visibility.

* **Take care of yourself.** Go the gym, eat healthy, and take time for yourself. This will make you more attractive, happier, and a better all around person.

Ok, big wall of text/tips is over. I hope this gives a little benefit to someone out there.

It was horrible, [/r/OkCupid](/r/OkCupid), he didn't listen to a word I said, but rather spent the entire hour of our date ogling my goodies, before trying to make out with me not once, not twice, but thrice.  After the third time he asked me to take him home with me, when I said no he said ""you're joking, right?"", then headed to the toilet to do God knows what.

I did what any self respecting woman would do.  I legged it and made a beeline for McDonalds.  He called me while I was ordering my double cheeseburger, and I rejected the call.  It wasn't until after I realised that I actually pressed ""accept"" and he heard me make my order.  Oh the humanity.

So here I sit, not half an hour later, eating my cheeseburger in my lovely frock and best heels.  Remind me again why we go to all this trouble?

EDIT: This story turned out even stranger.  At the time of writing, I was feeling tipsy from half a glass of wine.  As the night progressed, I became more and more out of it, and developed a severe headache, nausea, and a feeling of being ""disconnected"" to everything.  There is a really strong chance that this douchebag spiked my drink.  Thankfully, I had only drank half the glass, and I'm now very glad I left when I did.  I had a friend sit with me the night, and I held off sleep until it had worn off.  I've woken up the next morning feeling very ill and am currently deciding what I should do about it.

There's nothing wrong with it; if it's not your cup of tea, decline and continue with your lives. If you're not interested, that doesn't make them slutty, creepy, or weird; you're just looking for different things.

I use okcupid to find hookups, and there is absolutely nothing wrong with it. It doesn't make me morally inferior to you, and it doesn't mean that you are obviously more evolved than I am. 

Another thing, since I'm ranting already- just because a woman lists herself as bisexual doesn't mean you all need to pick apart everything about her. There's no reason to start trying to figure out whether she's ""really"" bisexual, and there is especially no reason why some folks should be discussing strangers' sexualities. It's their business, and not anyone else's.

Seriously, it's 2012. Time to move on as a society. Sex isn't bad.

So I'm getting a little burnt out with dating and this one just put the cherry on top. I messaged back and forth with this guy a couple of times before he asks me for my number. His profile was pretty glib but he seemed normal enough in his messages so I gave it to him.

We text back and forth for a couple of days. I usually find it pretty annoying when someone is constantly going on about my looks or asking me for pictures. Several times this guy sends me a message asking me for pictures because he ""wants to see my beautiful face"", ""can't remember what I look like"", or wants to know what my ""body looks like."" Just to clarify, I do art modeling as a side-job (I don't mention that on my profile) and I have professional photos of both my face and my body from my portfolio on the profile and they're rather good, so I don't know how it could be hard to have any doubts as to my looks. Accompanying these texts are the obligatory ;) ;P ;D ;) A couple of times he even told me he thinks I wouldn't send him more pictures because I was probably fat.

So he asked me if I wanted to grab dinner. I was bored and didn't have any plans that night so I said yes. I didn't go out of my way to babe-out for this guy. I get there and he didn't look like he put in too much of an effort either. So there's a little bit of a wait for the restaurant and he suggests we walk. We walk and talk for a few minutes and he asks me about my job. I tell him what I do for a living (it's a decent job, but doesn't pay a whole lot), and he continues on asking how I could possibly make enough money from that to live where I do alone. Then he starts to act really skeptical and I'm feeling pressured. 

""I still don't really believe how you can live alone,"" in a totally skeptical condescending tone... like he thinks I'm lying to him. 

So I just say, ""Well, my apartment isn't all that nice."" Because it's not.

""But still. I mean how do you live in *(my city)* alone?""

I just shrugged. What the hell do you say at that point? ""I SELL DRUGS AND I PROSTITUTE!"" 

We're walking down the street and it occurs to me we were probably out of range for our little beeper thing to work if our table was open. So I suggest we turn back. By a happy coincidence there happens to be a group of guys loitering on the corner, but of course Dipshit isn't losing any opportunity.

""Because you're too afraid to walk by some teenagers?"" His tone was even more condescending than asking about how I could afford to live alone.

Even then... what the fuck, asshole? If I wanted to turn around because -- I don't know -- maybe you *are* luring me to your friends to rape me? I don't know. I just met this guy. I ignored the tone and while we sat on the bench and waited for a table tells me about how he's collecting unemployment and isn't really interested in finding a job. I smile and nod politely and we finally get a table (maybe 20 minutes had gone by).

He then asks me to show him my other tattoos. I said no and he scoffs, raises an eyebrow and responds, ""Why? Are they all on your vagina?""

... ""No, they're private and personal and none of your business."" We order our food and he chooses this time to belittle me because I don't eat meat, telling me I'm pretentious because I don't eat meat. The waitress brings us our drinks and gives me this *I-feel-really-bad-for-you* look and he looks at her and says, ""Don't you think it's pretty stupid that she doesn't eat meat."" At this point the waitress looks at me in obvious distress mumbles about how it's really a preference and hurries away.

His phone rings, he answers it and talks to whoever it is on the other line for about 5 minutes (which is an eternity in first-date-time) about how/where they're going out that night. Getting drunk and an afterparty as soon as he gets out of here. He then hangs up the phone and looks at me and asks why I'm online looking for a date. I tell him I just don't have the time to go out and meet people as often as I like.

And he said ""Well maybe it's just your attitude.""

That. Right there. I was done. I put down a $20, got up, and walked out without a word. Didn't hear back from him.

**TL; DR** Big asshole guy belittles me for about an hour.

You may recognize this match question. Well, I can finally answer ""no"".

A little over 6 months ago, I wrote to a girl who listed smoking as a deal breaker. In that message, I jokingly said that I'd give up smoking for her. It was one of those occasions where I felt compelled to write something even though nothing could possibly happen. I didn't expect a reply, but the next day, I found this in my inbox:

&gt;Thank you for the kind words, but you shouldn't quit smoking for a stranger on the internet. You should quit smoking for your own health and the health of the people that you care about. Good luck in your search.

I had always wanted to quit, but it was just easier to kick the can down the road. But these few lines of kindness gave me the slap that I needed. That was the last day I smoked.

6 months on, I'm healthier and there's more money in my pocket. My apartment no longer stinks, and neither does my breath. Hell, I can even run a mile without feeling like death. The girl has since deactivated, but she's already given me so much.

&gt;Hi there. Mind taking a minute to help me out with something? I'm not having very good luck with people responding to my messages, so I thought I might ask girls in other parts of the country with extremely high match percentages what kind of messages you're most likely to respond to. What do you like to see in a first message? Could you give an example of a message you've received recently that really caught your attention?
Thanks so much!
--Mike 

*And these are the responses I got. Most seem to be conventional wisdom around here, but these are personal views of actual people.*






&gt;(1) Hey Mike. I usually like when guys mention something on my profile. It shows that they're actually interested in me enough to read my profile. I've also been known to like a challenge. Like when I say something jokingly on my profile and someone brings it up but throws in a joke, like when I get a message about why spiderman is actually a good character, it shows that a guy is secure enough to have a real debate with me, and is smart enough to not try to start that debate with something really serious. Good Luck! 

(2)

&gt;Personally I prefer a message with questions in it, and no short hand bullshit. So you've done well there, in my opinion.
I'm immediately turned off by things like ""hey gorgeous u look like someone I could get along with"" there isn't anything to respond to. Although compliments can be flattering if presented properly, they lack actual conversational fuel.
What kind of messages do you send? I really couldn't give you a constructive answer without knowing. 

(3)

&gt;No one wants to read a message that sounds like it could be written for anyone. Start off polite but mention something(s) you appreciated or agreed with on her profile. Ask her for details on the things her profile said she likes. Don't just say ""Oh, I like ______ too."" Its uninteresting and there's not much she can say in response to it.

&gt;Another tip that I had to take myself; Don't put so much emphasis on match percentage. 

(4)

&gt;Hahahaha... OK, so, I can't speak for the female population at large, but possibly these other high-matching chicks would agree:

&gt;Turn-offs include:

&gt;-""ur cute wanna cuddle?""
-""What part of town do you live in?""
-""You seem like a nice/fun person.""
-copy-pasted messages that were clearly sent to every other girl on the site (i.e. ""You seem like a genuinely fun girl and you're gorgeous as well. I would love the chance to get to know you better."")
-making condescending remarks about things the girl has said she really likes

&gt;Good ways to message someone:

&gt;-Ask about or make a joke about something in the girl's ""About"" section that strikes your interest (though I wouldn't go as far as to reference anything in ""Questions"" tab).

&gt;And... Uh... That's actually all I can think of. What do you normally open with? 

(5)

&gt;Reference something in my profile. Don't tell me I'm beautiful, cute, pretty, sexy, whatever. Don't just say ""hi"" or give me your name. Don't ask me out in the first message. Please ask a question.

&gt;The thing is, it's all dependent on if I find the person attractive or not. When I get a message from someone, if it doesn't contain one of the things I mentioned, I go read the person's profile. If at that point I like what I'm reading and what I'm seeing, I'll respond. Hell, I dated someone off here for a year and his introductory message was weird as fuck all. 

(7)

&gt;Stuff that shows that you actually read the profile, even if it's just ""oh hey I noticed we have x in common!"" and then a comment or question about it that sparks a conversation is usually pretty good. Messages that feel generic and could be copy and pasted to any girl get ignored pretty quickly. Good luck Mike! 

(8)

&gt;hmmmmm, it depends. I'll usually respond to those asking about myself or looking for recommendations on books, or even advice (such as this one). Kinda funny or quirky ones are cool, too, and I'll usually just have a little fun with those (that's just me, though; I'm not sure how other girls would react, with all the creepers on here and whatnot).
Generally, those that are about a sentence or two and asking me about myself, i.e. not out for a bootycall.
If you haven't already, you might also try doing some research on reddit.com/r/okcupid. Not sure if they'll have anything on messaging there, but they certainly have other good pointers. 

(9)

&gt;messages that just say ""hey how are you? i like (common interest) too, have you tried (something related to common interest). I personally get a little overwhelmed with a long message.

Aaaaand (10), this lovely lady wrote me a novel in response.

&gt;Hello. Normally, I just reply to people based on a few factors. The message must be intelligent, have evidence that the person has actually read my profile and not just copy/pasted something generic, and contain proper grammar and spelling. Creativity is a definite plus. I also check their profile for a few things. They must be an atheist, avoid certain profile cliches, and be reasonably attractive. I know that the attractiveness thing is a little shallow, but I'm not expecting like a model or anything. Based on profile I would have messaged you back. Hope that helps. :)

&gt;2 examples of long messages that I replied to:

&gt;Example 1:
&gt;Hi there Julia, my name's Benji and I just checked out your profile (obviously), and I've noticed we've got a lot in common, even for OkCupid. I was a vegetarian for 4 years. Not for animal rights reasons you see, I just REALLY hate Trees! I'm down with PC gaming, though I haven't actually played the clickfest you call Diablo. I have an alcohol stove made from soda cans. A part of me really wants to spray-paint something, and since I can't draw for shit, stencils sound like the tool for me. I could go on, but why turn this into a pretentious listocracy?

&gt;Since I'm told it's best to ask you a question, I figure I'll make it one you haven't heard before. If I had a monkey, I'd buy him a lock-pick and teach him to break into houses. Once he got in, he would steal their house pet (you have my word he wouldn’t steal Silver). I would keep a lookout for lost pet signs, and then return the pet to its owner. I'm sure some would give me a pie or maybe even a reward. I bet they would give me around fifty dollars. I would buy drugs with the fifty dollars. Not for me, for him. So he wouldn’t rip my face off. What would you do if you had a pet monkey?

&gt;Example 2:
&gt;Ever try on each other's glasses on a first date? So, so dorky. But fun :)

&gt;Also, I know ""jumbo shrimp"" is a choice example for pointing out oxymorons but to this day it makes me giggle. Back when I played this text-only online multiplayer game called Utopia, there was a kingdom called ""Who ordered the jumbo shrimp?"" with a funny stock cartoon pic of a waiter carrying out a tray with a jumbo shrimp on it as the kingdom's banner. The kingdom was of course oxymoron-themed, so everyone's name was an oxymoron.

&gt;Stay on OkC. It has plenty of dumbfuck users, but every site has those, and the amount of nerdy/interesting people here vastly outweighs the other sites. It's the best at what it does, in my opinion.

&gt;2 examples of short messages that I replied to:

&gt;Example 1:
What is your favorite Porcupine Tree album or song(s)?
Also, evolution and global warming are not things that one ""believes"" in or not. The evidence smacks people in the face and they either accept it or not.

&gt;Example 2:
Haha you're commentary on the dynamics of okc its spot on hilarious, if I didn't think you were so cool I would be tempted to blast you with all of them rapid fire style. :)
I would love to go on an adventure night with you sometime, all of that sounds great!

It's basically a free ""throwaway"" phone number that works transparently with your phone for calls and texts.  The neat thing is that when you get texts through it to your regular cell phone, it uses an alias number so you can reply right back and it looks like it's coming from your GV number.  If you make a voice call to that alias number, the call comes from your GV number.

The privacy advantages should be obvious.  They don't get your ""real"" number, you can easily screen or disconnect it from your cell phone when you like, you can block individual numbers, or just change your number completely (without affecting all your regular number people).

We had a great time, talked about all kinds of things and got along really well. 
I texted her the next day and said that I had a great time, thought she was very interesting and asked if she would like to go out again this week.

She got back to me this morning, said she had a great time too that I was handsome, charming and all that good stuff....but...

Apparently I look just like some other guy she knows and that would just make it too weird. Fair enough, I can see that. Short of major plastic surgery, there's really no way around that one.

But she goes on to tell me about a friend of hers and says that she thinks we'd really get along and asks if I want to meet her. So the three of us are meeting up for drinks later this week.

Tons of profiles read ""if I admit it, it wouldn't be very private would it?"" 

It doesn't say ""admit your most private thing."" It's telling you to figure out the highest level of privacy you're willing to admit and admit it. The most private thing you might be WILLING to admit might be something that's hardly private. 

Key word: willing. If you're not willing to admit it, that doesn't satisfy what the sentence is asking for, now does it?

Sorry. Just a rant I felt like sharing.

EDIT1: I realize some people are criticizing those that don't answer the question ""correctly."" That wasn't the intent of this post, but to each their own. I just find it annoying that tons of profiles read almost verbatim, especially when they aren't answering the question correctly.
