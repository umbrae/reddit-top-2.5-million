I know there's a Linux version of FTL because I use it, and Android is essentially just a specialized Linux build, so how difficult would it be to adapt the game so it can run on a (relatively) powerful phone? Did the devs pursue that at all?

The problem is, usually not ALL your weapons are good with autofire, so when you use one of them you have to remember to unfocus it so that it doesn't shoot and lose precious cooldown-missiles. 

That's tolerable at the start and midgame, but when you are boarding the enemy while using a bio beam, ioning the medbay, watching the attack drones so they don't get to destroy the ship, sending your Engis to repair your ship and opening airlocks to put out fires, it's quite probable that you forget to unfocus the ion bomb, losing your only missile ioning the shields that were already offline.

So I think that you should be able to put autofire to single weapons. That would give you much better control when you are doing a lot of things at a time. There should also be a button to enable autofire in everything and another to disable autofire in everything, much like doors.

4 of the flagship's crew were repairing the cloak room when it was defeated, so they were all actually in a part of the flagship that breaks away after the first phase. The game actually seems to recognise this and therefore kills any of the crew that are in rooms that break away! 

So basically, If you are struggling to kill the crew on the first phase, and the flagship is almost dead, focus the cloak, wait for the crew to go and repair it and then try to bring its hull to zero while the crew are in the cloak room :)

FTL Version 1.02.3 Live on Steam [UPDATE]
by Matthew » Fri Sep 21, 2012 10:44 am

UPDATE:

There's an updated changelog with a few more additional fixes for 1.02.3. The patch is now officially live on Steam and we're in the process of getting it to GOG.com and the HumbleStore (for people who purchased on our website). Unlike Steam, we don't have instant access to those builds so I do not know how long it will take for them to go live. I'll make sure to make an announcement when they do.

If anyone has any problems at all, please email zasdarq@ftlgame.com, make a post on this forum, or make a post on GetSatisfaction.com/ftlgame

If you have issues with the new way fullscreen works (in some situations, it's a downgrade in quality for some monitors / systems), then there's a new setting ""Fullscreen - FTL Native Resolution"" that should be identical to how it was previously so use that 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hello everyone!

I've uploaded a beta patch for some of the more common solve-able bugs and issues that have come up in the last week since release. You'll need Steam to access it for now since it's still undergoing testing before releasing it out to everyone. So check it out if it lists things that have been causing you problems or if you feel like being helpful and testing 

If you come across bugs in this patch specifically, when you report them on the forum, GetSatisfaction, or via email (zasdarq@ftlgame.com) please specify that you are using the Beta Patch for v1.02

Accessing the patch

Right click on FTL in Steam and select ""Properties"". From the ""Beta"" tab you can choose to opt into the Beta Builds. Put in the password ""betapatch"" (without the quotes) and press ""Check Password"" and it will download. If you have any issues at all, you can just revert back to None from that tab and it will re-download version 1.01. The downloads should only be about 5 MB so it won't take long either direction.

**Patch is available for GOG.com as well now. The HumbleStore builds should be available sometime later today. I'll update this space when they are.**

Changelog 1.02.5

* Restored functionality to those that don't support certain OpenGL features
* Fixed Zoltan shield display
* Added some additional logging/overrides to help in support

Changelog 1.02

**Compatibility Changes:**

* Older laptops experiencing ""overly pixelated"" or distorted images should now function
* MacBooks with ATI X1600 video cards will potentially function both in fullscreen and windowed. I do not have access to a MacBook with that video card, so if you're experiencing that problem please update me!
* Mac OS X version now implements Left-Ctrl+Left-Click to be equivalent to Right-Click

**Fullscreen Changes:**

* Fullscreen stretch now works differently and should be more effective at properly ""stretching"" to fill your screen
* Monitors that support 2560x1440 should be properly scaling and look much better (I'm jealous)
* Monitors with resolutions less than 1280x720 may now function in Fullscreen Stretched depending on your * OpenGL support
* A more elaborate manual mode is available for tweaking your desired resolution effect within settings.ini

**Additional Video Settings:**

* V-Sync can be activated within options mode. Depending on your system, you still might need to force it on or off from your video card control panel as well.
* Frame limiting is also available from the options. Between the two (V-Sync vs. Frame Limiting), pick the one that works best for you to balance performance and cpu use.

**Additional Game Settings:**

* Within options you can enable paths to be drawn when hovering over a beacon.
* Dialog keys will now have a brief delay before they are active, this can be disabled within the options.

**Other Bugs:**

* Start Crash Fix: Sometimes unidentified USB devices could cause FTL to fail to start
* Removed bugged weapon from the secret sector
* Moving crewmembers will still teleport assuming they are in the room of their final destination
* Killing the crew of an enemy ship will count as defeating it for stats
* Selling the Zoltan Energy shield will no longer be bugged
* Federation Ship will properly unlock on victory (and will unlock retroactively for those that experienced this bug)
* Secret Cruiser Type B stealth imagery has been fixed
* Fixed situation where a defense drone could become permanently powered
* Energy Shield can no longer be damaged while jumping, preventing it from properly recharging
* Fixed: Ion Storm and Nebula effects would disappear at beacons where you leave behind an enemy
* Saving in sector maps can no longer sometimes cause you to skip a sector
* Excess error message repeats removed
* Repeated ""victory"" in Sector 1 after restart fixed
* Possible fix for disappearing quests after Save &amp; Quit
* Possible fix for enemies jumping away despite destroyed piloting
* Fixed freezing enemy AI when low on health and medbay is on fire
* Save &amp; Quit in a store will no longer reduce repair costs
* Typos corrected in tooltips/weapons/events

**Edit List**

* Edit: Formatting
* Edit 2: Added information regarding version 1.02.5 ""hotfix"" updates. Credit goes to exoplasm for information
* Edit 3: [Direct link](http://www.ftlgame.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=9&amp;t=2707) to update topic on official forums

There has been some debate over what's better.  Engines, or shields.  
You see lots of players running around with 4 shields and 3 engines.  Some players will swear by upgrading engines first.  

I decided to figure out what is best.  **MATH TIME.**

***

I decided to look **just** at laser defense for this.  For missiles, you'll be pretty well off just using a Defense Drone 1, so I'm just going to ignore that.  I looked at a little thing I sorta invented called Effective Shields (abbreviated as ES).  ES is what you get when you apply your dodge to your shield level.  

If you've got 3 shields and 0% dodge, you can block three laser shots and won't ever dodge any.  You can block three laser shots and have 3 ES. 

If you've got 3 shields and 25% dodge, then you're statistically likely to dodge one shot out of every four.  So if four shots come at you, you're likely to dodge one and block three.  You'll take still take no damage, so it's **like** you have four shield bars and no dodge.  Thus, you have 4 ES.  

If you've got 3 shields and 50% dodge, you can take six shots.  You're likely to dodge 3 and can block 3, so you have 6 ES.

If you've got 3 shields and 75% dodge, that ends up being 12 ES.  Etc. Etc. Etc.

***

**[From there, I whipped up this little chart here.](http://i.imgur.com/VgXRQHF.png)**  You can use this to compare the cost and ES of different engine/shield combinations.  For example, 3 shields + 7 engines and 4 shields + 4 engines both cost the same amount of scrap, 375.  But the 3 engine case has 6.12 ES while the 4 engine case has 6.67 ES.  Therefore, if you had just 375 scrap to spend on defenses and just cared about blocking lasers, the four shield case would be better.

***

Another neat little thing I did was to check out the scrap cost per ES for each configuration.  If you sort by this, what get is a list of the **mathematically most efficient way to upgrade.**  In the end, it turns out the most efficient upgrade path, starting at 1 shield, 2 engines, is:

* 1 shield, 2 engine (1.43 ES, 0 scrap, 0 scrap/ES)
* 1 shield, 3 engine (1.54 ES, 15 scrap, 9.75 scrap/ES)
* 2 shield, 3 engine (3.08 ES, 65 scrap, 21.13 scrap/ES)
* 2 shield, 4 engine (3.33 ES, 95 scrap, 28.50 scrap/ES)
* 2 shield, 5 engine (3.64 ES, 135 scrap, 37.13 scrap/ES)
* 3 shield, 5 engine (5.45 ES, 235 scrap, 43.08 scrap/ES)
* 3 shield, 6 engine (5.77 ES, 295 scrap, 51.13 scrap/ES)
* 3 shield, 7 engine (6.12 ES, 375 scrap, 61.25 scrap/ES)
* 4 shield, 7 engine (8.16 ES, 555 scrap, 67.99 scrap/ES)
* 4 shield, 8 engine (8.89 ES, 675 scrap, 75.94 scrap/ES)

***

So, there you go.  If you also want to look at missile defense in with that, then engines look even better.  But, in general, it looks like a balanced build is best, with some very minor preference to engines.  

Of course, you're free to do what you want.  I know I personally don't exactly follow this path (e.g. I go S2E2 instead of S1E3, and S3E4 instead of S2E5, and no amount of math is gonna change my mind).  But this just goes to show you that something like, say, 4 shields 2 engines is **not** as good as something balanced like 3 shields, 6 engines.",,False,,t5_2tnu1,False,,ftlgame-flairMANTIS,True,t3_1j8qha,http://www.reddit.com/r/ftlgame/comments/1j8qha/engines_vs_shields/,

I'm no expert but I have beaten the game a few times; anyone else who's played through should feel free to contribute in the comments.

- Don't use auto-fire. It's better to concentrate fire from multiple weapons all at once so you don't have to worry about taking out enemy shields every single time you shoot every weapon. If you're being really tricky, you can take out shields with one laser weapon and while those shots are inbound, fire a heavy/hull laser so that it'll get through and do its bonus damage for sure.

- You can watch the weapons mounted on the enemy ship for a clue about when they'll fire. The red lights on the weapons will gradually turn green, firing at 100% green. You can also get an idea of how long they take to warm up by looking at how many lights there are on the weapon.

- The effects of powering/unpowering systems is immediate\*. You can (ab)use this in various ways, like turning off oxygen for half a second in order to boost your engines and dodge a missile strike. The immediate effects also extend to cloaking or turning on drones\*\*--if your micro is good, you can watch a missile get launched at you, and then cloak or turn on a defense drone before it hits you in order to avoid the impact.

      \* (This does not hold true for shields, which start down and must recharge when newly powered.)

      ** (If you turn off a drone when it's ready to fire (green) it should still be ready to fire when it comes back online, but if it was recharging it may still need to recharge when it's reactivated.)

- The door system is your friend vs. boarding parties. If you think you're overmatched, you can evacuate air from everywhere on your ship but the medbay and force the boarders to fight you in there (where your guys will be constantly healed). When possible I also like to keep the oxygen room pressurized in case an enemy ship hits it while the entire ship is venting into space since being stuck with 3% oxygen and a busted O2 system is bad times.

- ""Build Order"": With the Kestral (starter ship) I usually get 2 shields first, and then base my upgrades/purchases on what crew I acquire through events in the first two sectors (i.e. if I get a Mantis or a Rock I'm more likely to buy a crew teleporter early as they're good at fighting). IMO you want 4 shields, crew teleporter, and a good cloak by the final sector. I also like having a good bomb if possible.

- **Edit:** I also would recommend not fixing up your ship to full every chance you get. A number of events can result in some free/cheap repairs and these are wasted if you bought the pricey repairs at a shop. Likewise, I usually don't buy weapons or crew early on, since events can grant those too. Ship system upgrades can't happen through any events I've ever seen, so early on I prefer to prioritize those.",,False,,t5_2tnu1,1347746329.0,,ftlgame-flairHUMANMALE,True,t3_zvtqz,http://www.reddit.com/r/ftlgame/comments/zvtqz/some_tips_for_new_players/,

Getting 1HP achievement:

1. Set on easy
2. Grab Kestrel, deploy, don't spend any money except to upgrade blast doors to contain fires and boarders, who will be your #1 threat.
3. SAVE YOUR SCRAP.  Aim for 100 scrap.
4. Fly around until you find a store.
5. Fly around until you find an asteroid belt.
6. Quickly destroy the enemy ship.  Place two crewmen in the engine room and keep your pilot in the pilot seat.
7. DISABLE YOUR SHIELD
8. Let the asteroids bombard your ship.  They will come slowly, one at a time, and do one damage each.  Have your crew repair any damage to the engine or piloting areas.
9. As the last asteroid comes (to get from 2 hull to 1), raise your shield.  The delay should allow it to hit but have the shield up before then.  If all goes well, it should not have damaged your engines or pilot.  Even if it has, your shield will protect you until you can jump out.
10.  Jump and hit the store you saw earlier.  Spend your scrap en mass.

Getting full systems achievement:

1. Set on easy
2. Grab Kestrel, deploy, don't spend any money except to upgrade blast doors to contain fires and boarders, who will be your #1 threat.
3. SAVE YOUR SCRAP.  You will need a minimum of 300 (305?) scrap.  You will also probably need to spend some on repairs or fuel, but do so only minimally.
4. Do nothing except hoard scrap.  Always accept surrenders, as you usually don't get more -and free weapons/fuel save you more money.  This is best done in the first two sections, where you can hoard up to 200 scrap per section without fighting anything hard.
5. SELL EVERYTHING except for your Artemis and Burst Laser.  Unless you get a better weapon that only uses 1/2 energy, you'll only be fighting with those.  With this scrap, BUY: Cloaking Device, Crew Transporter, and Drone Control System.
6. If necessary, sell your Artemis and Burst Laser to get the last subsystem.  It will not matter after that.
7. YOU DO NOT NEED TO POWER THE SUBSYSTEMS.  You do not need one power for transporter, one power for cloak, and two power for droid control.  They simply need to be equipped.

I know that the full systems one is straightforward but some people were confused by what the achievement meant.  And some people were wondering an easier way to get the 1-hp achievement, so I figured I'd help out people have issues with the starter ships.

I've discovered, though, if you close all airlock escapes and then open all other doors, the O2 spreads out from the breathable rooms to make the vented rooms breathable almost instantly.

Imagine being paired with other players, some very experienced while some.... not so much. As the players, you choose your roles on the ship and try to make it to sector 8.  After finalizing your crew, you are set on an adventure with many other users watching your moves over livestream. Every member of the crew is important as they will be responsible in making significant decisions that effect the crew as a whole. Use critical thinking to make smart decisions while contributing to the victory of your team!  A successful run can net your entire team some of [these fabulous prizes]( https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0An9wNJsgKPBYdG82MjJ1LVV1dE1udW1wcHlXMFg5ZUE#gid=0)


------------------

Rules:

[1.] Join my [steam group](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/redditgiveaway/)

[2.] Enter chat room **whenever there is an announcement** that indicates the game is starting (This will happen many times over the course of a month).  It will be at a random time to give everyone a chance at participating. (The announcement should pop up in your steam so you will not miss it if you are online and have joined the group)

[3.] Once you are in group chat, you will be put in a queue or will be given instructions on how to enter a queue

[4.] People will be paired up according to the positions of the queue

[5.] Every team will be given 5 minutes of discussion to plan their strategy and assign crew roles

Crew Roles

* Pilot - (captain, decides jump locations, random event decisions, door control)
* Weapons officer - (decides what to fire and where to fire it, as well as drone controls)
* Engineering - (decides on store purchases and upgrades)
* Shields - (decides on internal ship upgrades, power transfer and shield controls)
* Additional crew - (damage control, teleporter operations)

[6.] Every round, the captain will decide where to jump and will make any decision required.  When combat begins, the game will be paused and everyone may submit a single action (or a series of actions if no movement is required by the player). Once an action is submitted, it cannot be changed till the next pause event.  The pause event is initiated upon each successful firing of your weapons (or the enemy's weapons if yours are out of order).

[7.] At each pause event, the crew will be asked one by one for any orders they wish to give

Pause event actions include:

* GOTO Room (GOTO weapons)
* TSFR,amount,from,to (TSFR,1,medbay,artemis)
* Jump direction (Jump south)
* Click,#/item (Simply describe option chosen or button clicked)
* Vent air (Will vent air to put out fire in a logical manner)
* Fire,weapon#,target (Fire,1,shields)
Events can be chained like so: Fire,1,shields &amp; Fire,2,shields &amp; GOTO scanner

[8.] You may not give any command after a GOTO command till the next pause event.

[9.] You may only give commands pertaining to your role if you are manning said station

[10.] You may not man each other's stations, except during a conflict.

[11.] Although weapons may be set to auto and left unattended, the initial firing must be manned.

[12.] Chatter must be marked as such: {{hey gais! lets burn the cru}}

[13.] If you get to sector 8, the crew wins a small-medium prize.  If you win the game, the crew wins a medium-
large prize.

------------

Other:

* Voice chat is available if all members of the crew agree to use it.

* This event is subject to the group rules on the group main page.

* Please be respectful of people who are not experienced with this game

* Difficulty will be **normal**

* Please post in the comments section on this page if you have any comments, questions, or concerns!



Thank you for reading this, and we hope to see you at the event!

1348236769.0,83,self.ftlgame,108yap,[Strategy] Ion Blast Mark II - build your ship around it and you'll easily sail to victory.,97,14,50,http://www.reddit.com/r/ftlgame/comments/108yap/strategy_ion_blast_mark_ii_build_your_ship_around/,"For the Kickstarter crowd, this won't be news, neither will it be for those who already have a number of successful runs under their belt. But we still see a lot of people struggling with the game and the Flagship, be it on Easy or Normal - and after over a dozen Flagship kills, most of them involving this weapon on a broad variety of ships, I wanted to present what I consider the strongest weapon in FTL.

What do Ion weapons do? They tempoarily disable systems they hit; if they hit shields, one shield bar will be disabled for every two points of direct ion damage. This is very powerful against enemy ships with 3, 4, 5 or zoltan shields (ion deals double damage against those), since the sooner shields are gone or lowered, the sooner you can start dealing real damage.

Now, most Ion weapons do that job and just that job - they help you take down shields. Some of them deal 1 ion damage, some do 2, and most of them have mediocre recharge rates. But there's one exception.

[The Ion Blast Mark II](http://i.imgur.com/yijqD.jpg)

Notice the *4 second* charge time? With a veteran crewmember on the guns, this drops to almost 3 seconds. Every 4 seconds, you deal 1 ion damage. Every two ion damage, a shield bar drops. *This is faster than most ships can re-activate their shields!* Which means that this weapon doesn't just temporarily lower enemy shields - it can take down enemy shields *entirely*. The shield bars vanish faster than the system replenishes, i.e. after a couple of shots fired, they'll be down to just one or maybe even zero shields. At that point, your ion starts hitting their subystems, taking those out (or, if you've targeted their shields, you can prevent them from ever going up again).

With a requirement of 3 power and a price tag of 80 scrap, it's rather easy to get this weapon and make it work, regardless of what ship you're flying. The Engi cruiser Torus comes with one pre-equipped (and, surprise, a lot of people feel that that ship is one of the more powerful ships out there). 

Due to the rapid fire rate, micromanaging this weapon increases its effectiveness even further. Once the shields are down and you're hitting the shield subsystem, alternate the shots between shields and something else, e.g. shields -&gt; weapons -&gt; shields -&gt; bridge -&gt; shields -&gt; weapons etc. That way, multiple subsystems can be taken out simultaneously. If you're really cruel (and patient), just ion down their Oxygen and let them suffocate (there's an achievement for that, too).

Should you happen to get *two* of these babies, then things get plain ridiculous. You can toy around with everything. Regular ships don't stand a chance, you can take your time in all sectors and leisurely cruise to the exit through the entire rebel fleet, and even the Flagship can't hope to defeat you. 

[Here's my most recent kill, with 2 Ion Blast Mk II equipped.](http://i.imgur.com/VLoSn.jpg) With cloak, boarding parties and drones (easily affordable, as no prior encounter was even remotely challenging), the rebels will flee in terror.",,False,,t5_2tnu1,1348237474.0,,,True,t3_108yap,http://www.reddit.com/r/ftlgame/comments/108yap/strategy_ion_blast_mark_ii_build_your_ship_around/,

I see a lot of posts criticising the difficulty, the randomness, the built in timers (in both the first stages and the final one), these post don't make sense to me.

What I find fun is the almost Alamo-like futility of most of my games. There are times when I die on the first stage, and times when I make it to the end and throw myself into battle **knowing** I don't have the firepower to survive. It isn't the winning that matters, it's the playing. The struggle against all odds climaxing in an orgy of smashed bulkheads and marauding boarding parties. 

I haven't been this addicted to a game, or this excited by gameplay in a long time. The graphics might be simple, but I have more empathy for my little crew than a whole platoon of Battlefield 3 players.

Comments? Criticisms?

*TL;DR : It's fun to lose, don't you think?*

**Edit: Great discussion!** 

*I do see a lot of people moaning about random events screwing them, taking control out of their hands, and calling this 'unfair'. I find nothing wrong with this. If a random encounter kills my 2 star pilot, I have a dignified funeral for him in the engine room, vaporize his remains, then promote some other poor bastard to pilot. Was it fair he randomly died? No. But that's fine. Also most times you are given the option not to risk your crew, so there is the coward's way out.*

[*The first few times I played the 2nd Layout of the Engi ship I died hilariously quick (score under 500), and could not make it out of the first area. It was a blast trying to keep my poor solitary crew member alive while my drones were running around failing to keep my ship from falling apart. Was it fair? No. Could I beat the game like this? HELL NO! Maybe with a few more tries under my belt, some luck, and some more experience I MIGHT do better; slightly.

I've got the damage dodge achievement and I'm going for the No Environmental Hazards one to unlock layout B. Unfortunately, my chosen path takes me through an asteroid field chokepoint. End of the road, try again next time. But wait! The exit is linked to another beacon in the other direction! It will take me about 7 jumps through Rebel-controlled space to make it. I've got 3 shields, 48% dodge chance, level 3 cloak, and an FTL charge booster, so it won't be a problem. ""Highway to the Danger Zone"" begins to play in my head.

Fast forward four jumps. My hull is a bit dinged, I've got three different boarding crews knocking around, and a lucky missile took out my sensors so I don't know exactly where they are. Normal operating condition, really. I check to see how many more beacons to go, when I finally realize: that other beacon connected to the exit? That doesn't connect to the rest of the map. Expletive. Now I'm neck deep in rebels and I have to fight or sneak my way back the way I just came, and I'm still not getting that achievement or the ship.

It takes another 10 hull, (I'm at 5 at this point) but I get back to the asteroid field. Only... it's not there. Once the rebels took over, they must have moved the beacon to a safer location! Personally, I'd like to think they bulldozed the asteroid field, because that's exactly the kind of stupid thing they'd do.

Heres what /u/awerjhop posted for the kestrel. I like this one.
&gt;I like to think you came into possession of this vital knowledge by chance.
You're kind of a nobody in the Fed fleet. You joined to fight the Rebel menace, and instead you're in charge of this outdated piece of crap Kestrel that's barely ""refitted"" for modern times, you have three green-as-grass ensigns under your command, and your only assignments are routine patrols through safe civilian territory to scare off would-be pirates.
Then, a prototype ship you've never seen before jumps to your position, badly damaged. With the ship literally going to pieces before your eyes, the fatally wounded captain hails you and beams over the information.

Think about it, top on the screen is your ship, with all the stats and stuff. You use the touch screen to redirect power and to aim at the enemy ship, and when you want to move your crew members you can use the bumpers to select a diferent one from the list and move them with the d-pad.

Not to mention something that really exited me, the AR cards, woudln't it be sweet to see the ships fighting along side a sandwich? 

The PS Vita also came to mind but I have a harder time visualizing how the gameplay would flow.

What would you like to see improved with them?

**Your starting crew having a bit of job experience.** Other members that join your ship could also have a bit of experience, how much depends on how you came by them. For example, slaves wouldn't have much if any, and an expensive mercenary might have lots.

**More control over what your boarders do.** It would be great to prioritise attacking a system over attacking the people. Sometimes I want to just get in there and sabotage that annoying drone control and then teleport out ASAP. It would also be great if your boarders could attempt to loot the ship, and be teleported back with some scrap/missiles/drones.

**Assigning duties to your crew.** Right now they always prioritise attacking boarders, repairing breaches, putting out fires, repairing system and then using the system. It would be great to re-organise that list, so for example you could have two crew in a room, one assigned to always use the system, and one attacking that boarder in the room. I don't want my engi fighting alongside my mantis and totally ignoring repairing the shields the ship so desperately needs!

**Using broken systems without repairing.** Linking to the above, being able to toggle prioritising using the system over fixing it to full health would be super useful when all you need is a little more oomph to win the situation.

**Setting up patrols.** When I have more crew than systems, especially when there is no teleporter, I'd like them to wander around the ship or follow a set path, and upon seeing a problem attempting to fix it. As well as that, being able to assign crew to automatically go to a system to fix it, as long as your sensors are up and running. 

I had more ideas, I'll add them in later when I have more time.",,False,,t5_2tnu1,False,,,True,t3_zx8j3,http://www.reddit.com/r/ftlgame/comments/zx8j3/a_few_suggestions_to_improve_crew_management/,

* Never accept any crew, never hire any more crew and if you get crew by random event, dismiss them immediately.

**One Man. One Ship. One Goal.**

The higher the efficiency number, the more it costs per point of effective dodge gained.  This accounts for increasing dodge effectiveness (including your crew manning bonus) as well as the cost to buy additional power.

For anyone that's unfamiliar with how the math of evasion works: each point of dodge percentage you gain is better than the last.  Let's take your ship with its 30 hull and fire enough Leto missiles at it to kill it - this will take 30 missiles if you're at 0% dodge, and an average of 30.3 missiles if you're at 1% dodge (an increase of 1%).  If you take a look at the other extreme, going from 98% to 99% dodge is also just a flat increase of 1%, but it increases the average number of missiles needed to kill you from 1500 to 3000 (an increase of 100%).

This means that going from 51%-&gt;55% dodge is actually a bigger increase than going from 15%-&gt;20% even though it's a 4% flat gain instead of 5%.  However, the cost of each Engine upgrade goes up significantly as well - faster than the effectiveness increases.  Notice the steep increase at Level 6 Engines, which cost significantly more for the dodge gained than Level 5 (more than twice as much per point of evasion gained).

**TL;DR:** Engines are very important and cost effective up to Level 5; higher levels aren't worthless, but they're much less of a priority purchase.",,False,,t5_2tnu1,False,,,True,t3_1itwoz,http://www.reddit.com/r/ftlgame/comments/1itwoz/engine_upgrade_cost_effectiveness/,

I'm sure I'm not alone in this, or am I in saying that FTL fits the bill rather nicely.

While I was playing today as the Engi, I decided that the sole Human crew member, a man named Nomi, to the Engine Room. I immagined this to be the lowest point on the ship, with the most danger, the dirtiest work, highest stress, etc. Being on an Engi vessel the Human was designated this low spot, and was referred to only as his station title of ""Engineering.""

What captured me about him was his determination. I know it was because of my control, but in my mind I couldn't help but hear the narrative and thoughts of the three crew members. After a particularly hard battle, ""Engineering"" would always be sent to clean up the mess. Also the Engine Room was often the first place hit by invading crew or missile attacks to cripple the ship, so he always had a very difficult time. I mean, he would have to patch breaches, put out fires, repair rooms, run the engines, and basically keep the entire ship functional while not even being acknowledged by his robot-like Engi crew mates.

One particular scene that still tickles me was when the ship was struck by a missile in the Engine Room. I pictured the Engi crew standing up after the ship is rocked by a massive explosion. They look at each other, then the monitors on the wall and the huge number of alarms to see where they were hit.

""Breach - Engine Room."" says the first gray alien, a lifeless drone of a voice efficiently detailing only the required information.

""Engineering? Status,"" inquires the second in a matching drone.

""Life signs: Stable.""

""Assist?""

""Negative.""

And the two gray analytical aliens go about their usual tasks of continuing the attack without even thinking about Engineering, who to them was simply doing his assigned task at the time.

Meanwhile in the Engine Room, Engineering is having the worst day of his life having to patch up a hole leading to fucking space.

He ended up dying in an attack after a laser tore through an already burning Engine Room. Of course I continued playing; the Engi were the ones on the mission in this run, and they would continue as long as the ship was functional. They went on and replaced Engineering with an Repair Sys Bot and forgot he ever existed.

And I guess that's why I wrote this. It might be a little childish, but if I didn't then, even in the silly universe I created in my own head, I'd be the only person to ever know Nomi even existed.

Nobody got my super subtle Star Wars reference, btw. :(

FEDERATION PRIME, Tuesday

Sources within the Federation Ministry of War have confirmed an increasing number of complaints coming from recent Mantis defectors to Federation forces. Said protests claim that newly-assigned Mantis officers are being appointed chiefly to security functions and denied access to technical positions, regardless of their individual skills or qualifications.

Ensign Kara, a Mantis serving aboard FSS Kestrel, shares this dissatisfaction. ""I've worked with engines all my life,"" she says, teary-eyed. ""My father was a starship engineer. I know starship engines inside out. But I've been in this ship for almost a standard year and all I've done is ship security and boarding. What's the use of all my knowledge if they just want me as a killing machine? It's not fair.""

Lt. Perry of the FSS Minanta is also distressed. ""When I was first assigned here, they put me in the armory. I was overjoyed! I'm an expert weaponsmaster. But then they got a new guy, human, and I was reassigned to security. No questions asked. Report to the teleporter. Hunt. Kill. Show no mercy. That was it,"" he relates.

Roxanne Smith of the Species Equality Advisory Group, an NGO specialized in discrimination cases, has filed an official complaint with the Ministry of War regarding these reports. ""It's right there in the guidelines. Federation Fleet regulations are very explicit. Section 4, subsection iii states that '...all officers aboard Federation starships are entitled to protection from discrimination regarding their planet of origin.' What they conveniently forgot, though, was to specify penalties for commanding officers who disregard these guidelines, and so they basically have free rein to do as they please, which means Human pilots, Engi engine techs, Zoltan shields specialists, and, as always, Mantis henchmen. No sentient creature is born alike. Why aren't the technicians among the Mantis being assigned to technical positions? They're just treated like fangs on legs, and it's humiliating to them as a species, and embarrassing to us as a governing body. It goes against everything the Federation stands for.""

Commander Matthieu of the Kalastor, however, disagrees. ""It's a practical matter. We know the Mantis are extremely intelligent. But when a Rebel ship is firing hull missiles and Glaive beams and you're being boarded by five hostiles with rifles, you have to take care of them with the best troops you have. And those are the Mantis,"" he praises. ""Besides, they're terrible at repair. Have you ever seen a Mantis try to use a hydrospanner? It's painful to watch. And if you want to be a tech officer, you need to be able to make quick repairs with the tools at hand. Not even the Rockmen are as slow as the Mantis with repair. When the shields are down and the engines are crippled, you need to get the ship up and running ASAP or the enemy is going to turn it into Swiss cheese. It's that simple.""

Smith, however, does not share the commander's pragmatism. ""It's the Ministry of War's duty to make sure all species are treated equally. Why aren't the Mantis furnished with tools they can physically handle? Why aren't Humans, Engi, and Zoltans given better riot gear to deal with invading troops? Because the Ministry wants to scrimp every last credit in this war at the expense of ethical values. And if we've turned into bigots because of this war, then the Rebels have already won.""

The Ministry of War has issued an official statement assuring citizens that ""The Federation Fleet is, as always, at the vanguard of defense of Federation principles of equality and justice, and that the Mantis complaints are being reviewed and will be addressed in due course."" They also state that ""However, (...) commanders, as per the regulations, as the supreme officers of their vessels, have final word on all operational matters, including, but not limited to, assignment of officer duties.""",,False,,t5_2tnu1,1356622212.0,,ftlgame-flairMANTIS,True,t3_15hyzd,http://www.reddit.com/r/ftlgame/comments/15hyzd/species_discrimination_charges_escalate_after/,

**Drones:** the one I want the most. Would increase drone damage, speed, or something. Could even allow you to control your boarding drones.

**Doors:** when manned increase time it takes for intruders to break through doors. Could just be binary (bounus vs. no bonus) when it comes to skills as having a ""doors"" skill for each crewmember seems a little silly to me.

**Teleporter:** would decrease the recharge time on the teleporter (but this would require a bigger room for the teleporter so the operator could stand off of the pad)

**Sensors:** I'm out of ideas for what this one could do, but I want a dedicated science officer damnit. :p

**O2:** ???

Now you would probably rarely use the option to man these unless you have extra crew and that's just fine. I just want the game set up so if you send a crewmember to repair, put out a fire, or fight, that you're always losing some functionality. Plus more options to place people would only lead to more interesting solutions to fights.

So, any ideas along these lines guys?

*30 seconds.* 

He looked to his right to his fellow Port Corp member Zzaz. He could see ZZaz’s eyes already turning from a subtle blue hue to a deep red ember. Something he was sure was the stuff of nightmares for most spacenaughts was now an oddly reassuring sight for him.  He had seen the two red dots time and time again move swiftly and silently in a darkened weapons or shield room slashing Rockmen and Engi and even those of his own race time and time again. 

There is a saying in the Federation that goes:

A spacenaught is dangerous job for fools and the Port Corps is a suicide mission for the insane. 

Being a spacenaught was already a dangerous enough thing flying in the empty vastness of space fighting in little more than weaponized coffins. But being a Port Corps member meant jumping into an enemy ship outnumbered sometimes in nebula storms bring chaos on enemy crew before porting back sometimes right as the enemy ship is literally coming apart. In the Federation it was a capital offense to wear the patch of the Port Corps unless you were a spacejumper and you don’t not get your patch until you survive your first space jump. In actual combat. 

*20 seconds.*

There is nothing like it in the universe. The feeling that you get in your stomach as your particles are hurled into space is something you never get used to. In the academy by the time you get enlisted on to a ship as a Port Corps private it was not unheard of to have over ten thousands space jumps on record. There was something truly unifying about it. The Mantis have a word for it in their own tongue. It roughly translates as “In the space between time.” The sensation in that nano perhaps femto second after you vanish from your own ship and before you materialize on some poor slug helmsman was both chaotic and serene. 

First all your outer extremities go. Non vital organs first. Logical enough. In the astronomically low chance an enemy missile hits the teleport room right as you are space jumping it is better that your head and torso are not the first parts to arrive conveniently ready to be tortured by the enemy for information. Nestool had heard horror stories from when the technology was first used for space combat. Luckily, modern advances in teleportation have made that grim fate a rarity and now it is little more that past convention that your outer limbs are tossed first. The feeling on your body as atoms are thrown electron by electron is impossible to describe. For that brief infinitely small moment you are truly in a space between time.

*10 seconds.*

And then. CARNAGE. Most engagements last less than 3 minutes. His first space jump into actual combat lasted less than a minute. The fatality rate among privates in the Port Corps for the first jump is somewhere around 50 percent. Half of all Port Corps members don’t make the port back their first jump into chaos which is the reason why you get your patch only after your first jump. Port Corps members are a superstitious bunch. Zzaz wore hers on her left maw. Nestool wondered how many times he had seen that maw tear into the head Zoltan before it fissured into nothing? He had never seen it in the teleport room being always in the bravo position.

*5 seconds.*

But this time he was in the alpha position due to the room schematic of the Engi ship and the needed positioning upon materialization. This was the last chance The Kestrel had to survive and everything about this boarding had to go right. They had one missile left. A fire bomb. The engi ship was heavily shielded and the Kestrel had taken heavy damage. It could take one salvo max from the full deployment of the enemy ship and then who knows which components would be damaged from that first salvo. Weapons and the telepad must not be hit. For the plan to work they would need some luck. They would telly into the cockpit and take on whoever was inside. 15 seconds later his two fellow Rockmen Port Corps brothers would telly into their weapons room. As soon as the injuried crewmen fled to the medipad room the fire bomb would blast it on fire and the Rockmen would rush as fast a Rockmen could into the medipad room. 

His muscles tensed up one final time before the jump. How many of them would survive this jump? He thought of his two Rockmen brothers Samson and Goliath waiting stoically in the next room. How many of the crew would survive the first salvo? He thought of his lover Charlie piloting the ship. 

*Teleport in progress.*

And then nothingness. The nothingness that always came but this time enveloped him slower than before. First his outer limbs then his torso and finally his head. His last sight before he was flung into the space between time was a pair dark red ember eyes glowing brightly in a void.

1347857193.0,58,self.ftlgame,100bfa,Mod Ideas? Let's collect em here.,66,8,113,http://www.reddit.com/r/ftlgame/comments/100bfa/mod_ideas_lets_collect_em_here/,"This might be premature, but in the spirit of this game being young and modding being available, here are a couple of ideas I've had:

- I think it'd be cool to be able to buy your way out of certain battles through bribery, just like an enemy can do to you. Offer up a crew member, some money, missiles, etc to end the fighting as an alternative to waiting for your FTL to charge. Not a big thing, but it'd be nice (especially in situations when your engine goes down or it looks like surefire doom).
- I'd like a modular way to mess with how quickly the fleet advances, right now I think it's a little too fast. I'd like options to totally remove it, even though I wouldn't, but also to have slower, normal, then quicker advancement. Then maybe also progressive and/or dice-rolled speed variables (progressive = starts with no advancement, ends up on quicker advancement by the final 1 - 2 sectors // dice-roll being that it'd roll a dice to pick a pace per each sector you go into). What you choose could affect the rate of your score (or, in some cases, disallow you from placing on high scores)
- I'd love more ways to get upgrades and augmentations. Sometimes this happens with weapons/drones, but I'd like it include upgrades and augmentations: say you defeat a ship without blowing it up, and that ship has drone upgrades but you don't, maybe you can get the drone upgrade that way, in lieu of grabbing scrap and buying it. This would probably unbalance gameplay toward boarding strategies though, and like I said, it does happen with weapons, but I'd like to see upgrades, even if it seldom happened.
- There should be another upgrade that allows you travel quicker; sometimes the one that lets you go backwards ends up being useless - I'd like something that let you travel to systems 2 points away from you, for example (or maybe a certain ship style travels quicker than others, etc.)
- It'd be nice to be able to extend the lifeline of your Hull; health upgrades (maybe it'd take an augmentation slot or something) It'd also be nice to, perhaps, sacrifice your total Hull health for other stuff (my main thought: more possible Power)
- CREATE-A-SHIP/LAYOUT
- This is a little out there and more of a roleplay thing, but i'd like to see some elements extended:
- - Abandon your own ship and steal another's if you wanted to (which could lead to, down the road, you manning TWO smaller ships, or opponents fighting you with two smaller ships instead of always just with one)
- - Some sort of hacking ability, so you could permanently down opponents' systems during a fight, as they sometimes can to you (maybe a fun/more balanced dynamic would involve you having to take down in your own ship whatever you hack on your opponents -- so you'd both lose two layers of your shield, etc. but obviously you could play to that if you had 4 shields, and maybe if you upgraded your hacking and put more power toward it, it would take less from you and more from your opponent -- they could always focus fire your hacking interface :p)
- - A way to play more stealthily/be undetected if you wanted to; steal cargo, crew members, etc, progress through the game on pure evasion/cloak, boarding with stealth parties and stealing

One of the things that makes the game so awesome is how genuinely open with potential it is. Got any ideas?",,False,,t5_2tnu1,False,,,True,t3_100bfa,http://www.reddit.com/r/ftlgame/comments/100bfa/mod_ideas_lets_collect_em_here/,

But I haven't seen too many people post about their favorite mods here, so I figured I'd give this some visibility.

This has to be one of my favorite mods, as it adds a lot of new items and graphics, on top of being overall pretty balanced. I used to run a combination of mods before hand, but this mod ended up combining a handful of those mods together.

Have you always wanted to attack the other ships asking for fuel? Now you can! What about fighting stations? You can do that too. Rebel ships seem too easy when they claimed the beacon? Now cruisers can spawn!

These are just a few of the features that this mod brings to the game, it really gave it a breath of fresh air for me while still being really close to the original game. That was one issue I had with other mods, they changed the game too much, or were just unbalanced.

Anyways, I recommend everyone should give this a shot. Especially if you've sunk hundreds of hours and love the game like myself, but wanted some more variety in gameplay.

Been playing FTL for a while - love it. But my personal wish is for a hotkey based crew system.

The idea would be to create a crew position key primarily. So CTRL/SHIFT+1 would send all crew to their designated positions. 

I am am constantly pulling my crew out of position. Especially after fights to heal up. Having a one press solution to positioning would really speed up things and ensure I have the right crew member in place (although that is rare). 

Another hotkey crew press would be good for grabbing a Engi or designated repairman to move them. 

I know this is a very minor detail but I don't think it would break the game in terms of balance just make things slightly quicker. 

Thoughts?

I've also started a thread on the [official forums](http://www.ftlgame.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=4&amp;t=2190).

I'll start by listing some links and my own findings.

* [ftldat](https://github.com/bwesterb/ftldat), a tool for unpacking and packing of the FTL .dat files
* [thread](http://www.ftlgame.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=4&amp;t=1920) about above tool on the official forums

* A lot *seems* to be moddable due to a fairly flexible xml -system
* Many things in there could be overwritten by hardcode

It seems the following have been tested:

* **Disabling the rebel pursuit is simple**. Instructions and necessary file: [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/ftlgame/comments/zyzl1/modder_has_figured_out_how_to_disable_fleet/c6911ii)
* All character names seem to be drawn from a single ""human"" list
* Ship statistics, systems and weapons are open to changes, but some limitations are in place (need more testing)
* Adding and moving rooms of a ship is possible
* The room layout (shipname.txt) file syntax is like [this](http://pastebin.com/8nprzHH6)
* Graphics elements can be changed

My own findings:

* ~~First sector seems to be hard coded, which is pretty annoying~~
* Changing and adding different kinds of sectors works

~~I'll try to work in custom events next.~~

Currently working on custom events:

* [BLERP sector](http://imgur.com/a/3Q9Ra) now has a custom startup event
* Added [a couple of events](http://imgur.com/a/wwikc) into the sector. One of them seems to have some issues.

If you are modding FTL as well, please comment and **share your findings**!

**-GOOD NEWS EVERYONE-**

I contacted the author of the [FTLWiki](http://ftlwiki.com/wiki/Home) and he kindly set up some modding sections in there. I suggest we add all our discoveries there from now on..

Also: [here](https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=18DgjbF054eNRNNRwg_cuDT2DatdRpnW16mzX32GB-Dw) is my new tutorial covering modding preparation, custom events and custom sectors!

Story time. The USS Redshirt (Kestrel type B, first of its class) began its run looking like the best ship since sliced bread. Enemies were falling left and right under the might of four laser cannons. We were flat out destroying slavers simply because we already had such a perfect and full crew (Two Zoltans, Two Mantises, Two Humans, A Rock, and an Engi). Sadly, it was not to last. 

By sector five we were still running almost entirely on those starting lasers, due to a near-total lack of useful weapons. All else we had was a Ion cannon I and a breach bomb, which brought more pain than usefulness when it accidentally fired into an enemy medbay a second time, killing both of our Mantises. Their brief funeral was shadowed by the threat of imminent demise for all, the ship now lacking any real offensive options. 

After a sector of running from tough enemies a chance shop brought some hope back, in the form of a Glaive beam (Henceforth referred to as the super-motherfucker-awesome-gun, or SMAG) and an Ion cannon II. The rest of the time heading up to the boss went fairly well, depriving ships of their shields and carving them up like roasts. So too did stage one of the boss, where careful planning even led to the elimination of several non-weapons crewmembers on their ship via application of SMAG and breach bombs. 

Stage two, however, saw the second near-destruction of the Redshirt. The pilot and shield operators both met their demise via a poorly thought out away mission, and only carefully timed cloaking kept the rest of the crew alive long enough to put out the fires. Things were looking grim, but we pressed on. After a hop to the nearest repair station, we took our last shot at the boss. 

Both ships went into the fight crippled and missing half their crews. We lost our replacement shield-operator to a boarding party, while missiles breached the oxygen and medical rooms. It was impossible to see how much of the ship was on fire or otherwise uninhabitable at this point, due to fires in the sensor room. Gasping for air, the crew threw down their last ounces of strength to tear through the enemy's hull for good, knowing that they themselves were doomed to die from asphyxiation soon enough. And so ended the tale of the USS Redshirt, first to successfully brave the terrors of normal difficulty and come out ever-so-slightly victorious.",,False,,t5_2tnu1,False,,ftlgame-flairENGI,True,t3_10ltt8,http://www.reddit.com/r/ftlgame/comments/10ltt8/just_had_my_first_victory_on_normal_about_two/,

Copy pasted from the FTLgame Forum. [Link](http://www.ftlgame.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=12&amp;t=3197) to said post. I am the author.

Update 3: Disregard Update 2. There is still something wrong

**IMPORTANT UPDATE**   
Update 2: I've found out why the game crashes, and a fixed version of the editor will be uploaded soon. I just want to add some new features first. In the meantime, here is a workaround : 

* Open the created blueprint.xml.append in notepad
* Find the &lt;crew count=""x"" class=""y""&gt; element
* Change it to &lt;crew **amount=**""x"" class=""y""&gt;
* Find the &lt;weaponList count=""x"" missile=""y""&gt;
* Change it to &lt;weaponList count=""x"" missile**s**=""y""&gt;
* Save, zip both folders, rename to .ftl 
* load with GMM

Update 1:
I've added the remove rooms/doors features, reworked the door adding system and fixed some minor bugs. version 0.1.1 is available for download below.

While the Door system now produces some graphic artifacts, it should be much more intuitive. The alternative to the artifacts would be flickering whenever the mouse is moved.

Hi,

I need some people testing my Ship creator. The game crashes when i use the created files and i don't know why.
Explosion animation,system images(computers n stuff) and loading .xml files aren't in it ,yet. Some criticism on the design would be nice, too. 

[screenshot](http://imgur.com/ECusJ)

It is written in C# so it needs the .NET framework or mono to run. For people running linux /OS X: It works with mono for windows, but i haven't tried it on any other OS yet.

How to use

1. Load a ship Image, layout Image and shield Image with the 4th,5th and 6th Button.

2. Position ship and shield with the buttons/text fields in the top right corner.
Align your layout with the grid. You can turn the grid and a Screenshot on/off with the last two buttons in the menu to help you find the right position.

3. Add as many rooms as you like to your ship by selecting the 8th button. Click,hold and drag to draw a room. right click to finalize the drawn room. Rooms can now be removed with the 10th button

4. Connect your rooms with doors by selecting the 9th button. Door placement should be intuitive now. Just move the mouse where you want the door to be placed an left click to put down. Doors can now be removed with the 11th button.

5. Assign Systems to your rooms with the 13th-23th Button. Just select a System and click on a room. Only one System per room and only one of each system per ship.

6. Select the Weapon mount position by selecting the 12th button. Select which orientation you want for that mount. Click on the map to draw a mount, right click to finalize.

7. Edit the systems in the ""Systems"" tab on the bottom left. The number in the box is the power that system starts with when you start or buy it. Check the checkboxes to select whether or not your ship should start with it.

8. Click the Weapon/Drone boxes in the bottom left to select the starting weapons/drones. Click ""Custom"" if you know the ""name="" of a custom weapon.

9. Customize your crew in the ""Crew"" tab in the upper right tab.

10. Edit the Ship name etc. in the ""Ship"" tab on the bottom left.

11. Click the 2nd button to save the ship to a folder. Existing files will be overwritten. The tool will create subfolders. To create a .ftl mod file for GMM, simply zip everything in the selected folder.

Please consider that this is the first piece of software I ever released, I don't know what to include, so please excuse errors i made. Its also probably written pretty hacky, so excuse that ,too.

The blazing heat was the first thing we noticed. The FTL beacon had drifted dangerously close to a red giant and we were getting cooked. Suddenly a Mantis ship was on us like plasma sticks to a warp core. My FTL drive was charging like old people fuck and our shields were getting pounded. My crew rushed to try to put out the flames as solar flares devastated our door control and O2. Pulse after Pulse fired from our cannons as we burned from the inside.
The Enemy had no regard to their own safety and suffered for it. They focused on repairing their guns instead of their shields. The mistake cost them their lives as the next wave of solar matter atomized them.
My crew rushed to the forward bulkhead as I opened every door I could to space.
The Fires were out but we had to Jump or be burned alive.
We limped to the next point blind as suffocation was taking hold. Scanners were useless due to the nebula. The crew rushed the o2 room with a slim hope of fixing it before choking out when out of no-ware we hear a message over the coms... Prepare to be boarded.

Two brave engineers held their breath long enough to get the life support operating again but would not live to enjoy their efforts. My two Mantis Mercs got to fighting the intruders while I tried to get the engines fully repaired so we could run for our lives again.

I fired my phaser at the last Rebel intruder when he came for me in the engine room... and then I was alone.

I have gone through three sectors now with nothing but the computer to keep me company. I hide from everything, putting every piece of scrap in to a cloaking device I got trading missiles with a strange rock creature.

Basically I wanted to see how much scrap it would cost to get a ship with just an engine, pilot, O2 system, and nothing else and build a starter ship.

Most of you have noticed that the starter ship, the Kestrel A, is kind of underwhelming. And it is! Kestrel A is tied for the cheapest ship with the abysmal Zoltan B. The Engi A, the most valuable ship, carries over 300 scrap's worth more, almost all in drones and drone parts.

Other things I learned doing this:

* The ships that are drone- or missile-reliant, such as the Rock or Engi ships, make up for it by simply having more stuff. There's a big jump in value between the Rock/Engi ships and the rest.

* The Kestrel and Federation ships are the only ones without augments.

* You start with 30 scrap on Easy and 10 on normal.

* Compared to the average (median) ship, most ships trade out a small system for a big one. The exception is Slug B, which eschews a 60-scrap medbay and 40-scrap sensors for a 75-scrap teleporter.

(Edit: Slug B starts with 25 missiles, not 15. Thanks to Troacctid for setting me straight on Crystal crew)",,False,,t5_2tnu1,1350159889.0,,ftlgame-flairSLUG,True,t3_11cik5,http://www.reddit.com/r/ftlgame/comments/11cik5/i_put_together_a_chart_of_all_ships_by_scrap_cost/,

It won me over quickly, Zoltan power management is a nice quirk, and the Halberd beam early-on is able to destroy ships before they even get past your overshields, makes you feel invicible.

I was building up a strong, diverse crew of engies, Slugs, a human pilot and my 3 Zoltan men. I was cruising through sectors, and even when I took dangerous hull damage, a store was in jump-range and I had a bounty of scrap.

Then I fucked up, I guessed the distance of the rebels incorrectly, and ended up facing a Rebel Elite, their quad-lasers ate through my shields and took out my guns, their triple shield was too much for my usual Leto to shields, laser to guns and shields, leto to shields and finishing Halberd to deal with- I went from strong armor and a confident future to 5 hull and incoming missiles, luckily- with no missiles and 1 fuel for the jump, I made it through the sector beacon- Yes, it'll be risky, but if I can find a store, get some fuel, maybe fix the hull a bit, I can try to recover.

I was instantly intercepted by pirates. Their shields were powerful, and I may have had a chance with it I still had missiles, but I didn't. I ran my engies not working on systems all over the ship, fixing the system before the enemy lasers came in, they had a heavy laser, dual laser and a beam, dangerous, right? Would have torn me apart in a few hits on a normal occasion.

After a minute of taking in hits, I realized something- my shields were lvl 3 (My thought being the Zoltan boost and a triple base shield would be too strong for anyone to pierce.) Their heavy laser/dual laser combo would take my shields down, but they didn't seem have enough power to arm them along side the beam, so they would lower my shields only to have them recover before the beam would charge.

This lead to a stalemate that potentially would last forever- they wouldn't jump away, most likely thinking my low hull strength made me a target pointless to run away from. They couldn't pierce my shields, and I couldn't pierce theirs.

[The situation](http://i.imgur.com/a2lxz.jpg)

After awhile all my system workers were on gold level, and we were dodging almost every shot coming towards us. Over the course of roughly 20 minutes, I alternated crew members to different systems and got them to gold level on multiple systems, I was hoping this would help me do more damage, or anything that would help me win. unfortunately, my attempts were in vain, the eternal struggle was starting to make the crew, and me, exhausted, we decided that even death would be a better alternative to this hell, and agreed to make this ship our mutual graves.

Pause, shields down, move Zoltan to system-less room, open all airlocks, disable weapons, say your last words. 

[Unpause.](http://i.imgur.com/Sr8Nb.jpg)

Instantly they barraged the unshielded ship, laser followed by beam followed by laser, my men didn't even have time to choke to death before they were consumed in flames.

[Game Over](http://i.imgur.com/rL8pX.jpg)

RIP, crew of the FSS Unum, your travels shan't be forgotten.

Today I decided, for my after school class, that I would just play FTL with them and have them make all of the decisions.

After Breezing through most of the tutorial, we started a new game with The Kestral.  (they renamed it The Sexy Lady.)

After the first few encounters my class decided The Sexy Lady was going to be a ruthless killing machine.  Ship offering a bribe? KILL!  Stranded rebel spaceship? KILL!  Arrived at a store? KILL! (well, at least they wanted to)

Their motto was 'only attack.' So we only upgraded the weapons and the reactor.  The ship actually found a level 2/3 (can't remember) laser, so it had a decent punch.  

Unfortunately the classes combat strategy was, and this is a direct quote, ""Center Only.""  Find the center of the ship and bombard it with everything.

Sector 3 found us facing a mantis ship with a boarding party.

""Full power to the main gun!"" I shout. ""Target all weapons on med bay and weapons bay; Mantii, prepare to board. We'll need you to take out their shields.""

My crew members follow my instructions perfectly. The mantii rip them apart except for the last two rebels trying desperately to put out the fire spreading for the med bay. The rebels succeed and reroute some of the power to the weapons bay and manage to teleport a bomb onto our own teleporter.

""Get off the helm and off the engines! Fix that so we can bring these boys home! Cut off the weapons; let the artillery do it's work.""

I look on my display. The main gun is at 90%. This is gonna be close.

The enemy has decided to focus on the Mantii. My boarding crew is getting desperately close to death in this prolonged battle.

The display flashes, ""Main gun at 95% power.""

""The teleporter is fixed, captain,"" shout the men.

Perfect. Just in the nick of time.

The AI comes on, ""Artillery beam at 98%.""

""Activate teleport!"" I'm shouting, unaware that the repairmen are still on the platform.

""Artillery beam at 99%!"" chimes in the AI as my misplaced crew get caught in the teleport and are beamed aboard the doomed enemy ship.

""Primary weapon at full power.""

The repairmen don't have time to think. They finish their teleport and pull out their weapons.

You can feel my ship heat up as the plasma surges through the artillery cannon's mechanical veins.

The repairmen only get off one shot each, but it's enough- the rebels slump to the steel floor, dead. The ship is now mine.

""Primary weapon: powered down"" flashes the screen in front of me.

I quickly beam my crew back on board the ship.

""You're a real asshole sometimes,"" says one of the Mantii as he hobbles past me to the med bay.

""Nonsense- we had it the whole time. Wasn't even close!"" I say triumphantly. The crew watches through the window as the rebel ship explodes from an uncontained fire.

""Sure.""

2) Don't have an away team taking over a ship that's about to jump to lightspeed. It will vanish and you will lose everybody.

3) If you send an away team, turn off the auto-fire on your lasers. The ship will blow up and you will redshirt everybody.

4) If you send an away team, decommission your anti-ship drones. The ship will blow up and you will redshirt everybody.

5) Don't send an away team onto an automated rebel ship. There are no lifeforms and so these ships do not need oxygen. You will redshirt everybody.

6) If you send an away team, don't blow out the ship's oxygen. You may redshirt everybody.

There may be other ways to accidentally kill your away team, but these are the ones I've found **accidentally** in the last two days. I can't think of any other ways, but that doesn't mean I won't accidentally find them in the next two days.

I enter a new sector and a station is under attack, so I decide to protect it. I wanted the extra scrap, so I board the enemy ship. In order to kill all of the crew, I send two waves, leaving no crew members on board (my ship was on fire and broken so I wanted to kill their crew as fast as possible). Naturally, however, I forgot to turn off my weapons. I destroy the ship. I think that I have lost as all my crewmembers went down with the enemy ship.

However, with no crew, I salvage scrap and missiles from the rebel ship. I still finish the quest, and the thankful station opens up a shop for me. What's more, they have crew members available. So, apparently with the autopilot shopping, I sell a bomb weapon and hire a Slug. He starts to repair the oxygen so that I can make my ship semihabitable again (many parts are still on fire, several breaches exist, and the med-chamber doesn't have oxygen and is broken so I can't fix it without my slug dying). The brave slug fixes the oxygen and right before he dies from asphyxiation I open the shop quickly, sell a drone and another weapon and hire another slug, without questioning how this particular slug might feel about going on a ship with only a single dying crew member on it.

The new slug successfully saves the ship, allowing me to successfully survive going to 0 crew members. Naturally I didn't make it much farther but I've never had something that weird happen in the game before so I thought it was worth a tell.",,False,,t5_2tnu1,False,,ftlgame-flairZOLTAN,True,t3_1jrmok,http://www.reddit.com/r/ftlgame/comments/1jrmok/saving_my_ship_with_0_crew/,

The Red Tail launched with Captain Atreyu, Chief Engineer Vincent, Tactical officer Varnas, and Marine Junpeng.  Our heros were lucky enough to acquire a Crew Transporter early on, resulting in a great deal of successful boarding actions.  Around halfway to the Federation base, however, they began to get concerned: their weapons loadout had not changed in days.  Atreyu assured his crew they would find something to help them defeat the rebel flagship they knew was persuing them.  Sectors passed, and while the ship gained remarkable defenses, it's offensive capabilities were used primarily to keep enemies weapon's disabled so that Junpeng's marines could capture other ships.

It was around the 6th sector that a prodigy came aboard.  His name was Mattieu and he was a rockman with an unquenchable appetite for violence.  Naturally, Junpeng recruited him for away missions.  For a time, The Red Tail was unstoppable. With the Mantis and Rockman materializing on the bridge of attacker's and the Red Tail's guns keeping the enemy's sick bay and weapons disabled, nothing could escape their grasp.

During this time of plenty, Atreyu managed to find for his ship a Burst laser Mk 1 and an Ion Blast gun.  He was certain they would not be enough to defeat the flagship, but they were better than the rickety old Basic Lasers his ship had come with.

In the final sector before the Federation base, Junpeng and Mattieu beamed over to an automated scout ship to weaken it's weapons.  As usual, they would beam over, do a small amount of damage, and immediately beam back so that they did not suffocate.  Just as the duo wrecked the ship's primary weapon, a Burst Laser Mk III, Junpeng's Oxygen indicator beeped, signalling it was time to come home.  

""Two to beam back, Captain!"" he radio'd back.

""Alright I've got a lock and... wait! no I've lost you!"" came the response.  To the boarding party's horror they saw the telltale blue glow of a cloaked ship around them.  Knowing he had only seconds left to live, he looked in Matteiu's eyes and spoke his last words. 

""Make me proud.""

Mattieu flew into a rage watching his mentor die. two more weapons were crushed under his rocky fists before Atreyu could pull him back.  It did not take long to finish off the automaton, but the damage was done. Junpeng was dead, and his body would never be returned to the homeworlds for a proper burial.

In the aftermath, Captain Atreyu found Mattieu in his quarters.

""He taught me everything I know about being a marine."" The rock rumbled.  ""How can we hope to defeat the rebels without him?""

""Our mission hasn't changed, Matt.  We still need to get this Intel to the fleet.""

""Who will lead the away missions? You know that our weapons are insufficient.""

""You will.  There are two slugmen on the engineering crew. Choose one as your squadmate and bring him up to speed.""

The rest of the journey was the same as before.  Ships were captured, repairs were made, and still, no weapons presented themselves. The Red Tail jumped into the Federation sector at last, Ill prepared for the battle ahead.  Upon their arrival, Admiral Tully greeted them with some surprise, and immediately set them to the task of destroying the rebel flagship.  There were a number of minor upgrades the crew could apply, but nothing to improve the weapons.  They jumped towards their foe with heavy hearts.

The battle was long and hard.  Mattieu and Paul, his rookie teammate wasted no time in eliminating the isolated gun crews and disabling the ship's primary weapons.  The trouble was, their weapons could barely punch through the behemoth's thick shields.  Their Ion Blast gun could weaken them, but only a lucky fourth laser shot could hope to do any real damage.  Again, the task of disabling the ship fell to the Boarding Crew.

Teleporting onto the bridge was a useful tactic. It distracted the helmsman enough that Varnas could launch occasional salvos, weakening the shields.  The cloaking device proved dangrous as well, blocking Atreyu from rescuing his men with impunity.  Countless times was Paul brought back only a second before a final laser would spread his brains across a bulkhead.  The shields and Cloaking device rooms were occasional targets of boarding too.  With careful timing, Mattieu and Paul could teleport into the shield room just after Varnas hit it with a laser and prevent repairs from being carried out long enough for another shot or two to damage the generators further.  This was not without danger though, a few times Mattieu or Paul found themselves too close to a rupturing plasma conduit.  Eventually, Paul fell to an unlucky combination of stealth, defensive marines, and a stray shot from Varnas.

After an hour of Guerilla boarding actions with the remaining Slugman, Mattieu reported back to his captain.

""Sir, the port wing has suffered some very heavy damage. If we can get a couple of good hits on it, She'll break up.""

""That's true, but then her AI commander will upgrade our threat rating. She'll jump away, repair, and come back with her drones.  We can't do that!""

""If I can get her crew in that wing, she won't be able to repair.  We'll cripple the bitch.""

A moment passed as Atreyu considered it.

""Do it.""

The next boarding action went straight to the Cloaking device.  Just as Matt predicted, the crew's response was durastic.  Two marines and an engineer met them and a firefight broke out.  The hull creaked around them as the stresses of the long battle took their toll. The device began to glow and Matt thumbed his radio 

""Captain! now!""

The Rock and Slug teleported back to their ship just as four superheated bolts of energy ripped into the port wing of the ship. It gave one last groan and ripped away, spacing half of the behemoth's crew.

The Red tail crew celebrated briefly as they patched up the damage they'd taken in the fight.  In a few minutes, they were off again to engage the evil rebels again.

As soon as they jumped into range of the ship, it was clear this was a very different beast.  Swarms of drones came at them, lasering and beaming their way through the Red Tail's shields.  Boarding Drones smashed their way through the hull and for a time it was very touch-and-go.  Clever clocking and med bay rotation saw every boarding drone repelled and every attack swarm avoided.  Soon, it was time For Mattieu and his protoge to take the fight to the enemy.  They made short work of the flagship's primary weapons. and for hours they teleported around the ship, disrupting repairs and systems until the starboard wing began to show signs of stress just like the port one did.  Eventually it was ready to break off, just like the last one.

The Rebels has learned from the first encounter though, and only sent one man to defend the drone Controller.  After hours of cat and mouse, finally a salvo of lasers tore into the rebel's orange hull and the starboard wing broke off as the flagship jumped away.

The Red Tail crew patched themselves up again and steeled themselves for a final confrontation.  The flagship was crippled,and was down to a skeleton crew.  Victory was within grasp.

As soon as the ship jumped into weapons range, Atreyu knew something was wrong.  He couldn't get a lock on the flagship's interior, even though it had no cloaking device.  A Zoltan shield!  The intruder alarms went off and he heard muffled screams from the Engineering bay.

""Matt! Repel boarders!"" he yelled into the Intercom.  The proximity alarm sounded from the main ship interface as missiles and laser blasts sped towards the Red Tail.  Atreyu managed to dodge some of them, but most tore into the ship like piranhas into a wounded gazelle.  As he attepted to bring the ship around for an attack run, his sensor suite wanted him. ""Power Surge Detected""

""Oh no..."" he muttered.  Green bolts flew out from the rebel ship, more than Atreyu had ever seen from a single weapon.  Atreyu braced himself for the worst.

At the stern of the ship, Mattieu, Vincent and Varnas fought off the rebels who had transported aboard.  The med bay's holo-doc kept them patched up as they fought tooth and nail.

""You cannot kill me, human! I am invincible!"" Matt yelled, throwing his fist at one of the rebels.  Two against three was great odds, even if they weren't being healed.  He began to hear loud banging noises from the airlock door.

""Stupid rebels! teleporting into a vented airlock!  I hope you like the taste of space!"" Matt laughed.

Suddenly alarms sounded and the room exploded.  The holo docs disappeared, and Matt's slug teammate lie dead on the ground.  The airlock had been blasted open as well and the air rushed out into space. one of the rebels also perished in the blast, and the remaining two drew their weapons and pointed them at the raging rockman.  He closed his fists and prepared himself for death.

Back on the bridge, alarms assaulted Atreyu from every direction.  Life Support, Sensors, Sick bay, and Shields were all offline.  There were three hull breaches, and most of his crew were on death's door.  This could be the end of their journey.  One system, however was not damaged beyond use: The FTL drive.

""I swore I'd never run from these dogs...""

He called up the star chart and jumped away, just as another round of missiles penetrated the shields.

The Red Tail appeared a few light years away, venting atmosphere and spinning out of control.  Mattieu could feel himself losing consciousness as he fought the two rebels in his med bay.  One's life ended under his fist, and the other at the end of his foot, kicked out the gaping airlock, just before it automatically sealed itself.  Matt collapsed to the floor ad the rest of the crew, minus the captain, rushed past him to repair life support.  after a moment he got to work fixing the holo docs so it could patch him up.

As captain Williams guided his old Kestrel class ship to the jump point, he could not help but reflect as to why he got this assignment. It was not the ship, The Macaw was reliable, but that was about it. She was beat up, patched and sent back out or her normal piracy patrols for the last century. She has had more crew die in her hull than most battleships. Only the most basic systems are installed. Even her weapons border on a bad joke.

It can't be the crew either, Liam and Mikhail are fresh out of the academy. Hell he was not even sure if he deserved the captains seat after ""the incident"".

Or rather ""sort of multiplayer"". Most of the game is played as a single player campaign by two players in parallel, but the final boss fight is replaced by a battle between them to test which one built a better ship given limited resources. Both players have the same sectors with the same nodes to make it fair. Probably best played with friends.

Okay, so my thoughts:
We can board ships, why do we just scrap them!? Why cant we assign a crew (as in permanently sacrifice 1+ of our crew), and micro-manage an armada? Maybe make them secondary, AI controlled, maybe send them to slow down the rebels/report back later with scrap/weapons.
Multi-ship combat would potentially be a headache if each ship needs to be managed on the current level. So again, the AI may be a good idea.

It's a small feature, and it wouldn't really save the player a lot of time or effort, but I think it would add some immersion. Losing your chief weaponeer would sting more than losing a random Zoltan, you know? It would also make managing your crew's skill levels a little simpler.

I played a game with the Engi type B ship, the drone one that only gives you one crewman to start with. My brave Engi set out to foil the Rebel plans all alone. It was so lonely that when a slaver ship showed up and demanded the surrender of one of the crew that the rest may go, he almost willingly became a slave just to be around other lifeforms. Instead, he fought, for the Federation, and the slavers died without offering a slave. 

Eventually, our brave Engi hired on two more crewmen, a human and a Zoltan. Then a human from a demolished Federation moon base joined the crew. Hooray! The Engi had more friends than he ever had, and he became BFFs with the Federation human. 

Then, one battle went seriously awry. Explosions, fire, and oxygen-less emptiness filled the ship. The undamaged drone control station managed to destroy the enemy ship with the level 2 attack drone, but the ship itself was in trouble. All the crew worked frantically to repair it, but the oxygen, med bay station and other rooms were severely damaged with several holes in the hull. Soon, all the oxygen in the ship was gone as the crew died one by one. First, the hired help. Then, the Engi died, leaving the Federation human alone without oxygen in the med bay.

In the coldness of space, the human upgraded the med bay with a little scrap to patch himself up while he had no air, then he tried to repair the oxygen supply, running from the med bay to the life support station, then back before he asphyxiated. But he couldn't do it. The Engi might have been able to, but...

Then, just when he was about to give up and leave the Federation to its demise, he remembered. The system repair drone! It was deactivated during the battle, but now could be switched in. It worked with the Federation human to fix the ship, then he set out, alone, determined to make it as far as he could.

It surely seemed hopeless, but just like the Engi captain before him, our Federation human set out alone, unwilling to surrender. He, also like the Engi, found other crewmen to bring aboard the ship. He upgraded it beyond what the Engi had been able to do. Two heavy lasers, a level two attack drone, a level one attack drone, and a Pegasus missile launcher. The Federation human arrived with his 3 crew to warn the Federation.

But we all know the Federation is a bit of a jerk. ""Oh, you made it all the way out here? Great! Now go fight the biggest, baddest ship we've ever seen with your trash bucket of a ship cobbled together from scrap like a bird's next is from sticks."" Gee, thanks.

But the Federation human and his 3 crew set out to do battle with the dreadnought. The first battle went well. The second, not so much. Luckily, a nearby repair station was not too out of the way. After a quick fix up, the human and his Engi ship leapt to do battle one last time.

Fire, explosions, no air. It was all happening again, just like before. No system repair drone available this time. The air was leaving, systems failing, fire spreading. Then one crew man died. Then... the enemy ship fell apart.

""We did it!"" the crew said.

I've updated the instructions below.
 
[screenshot](http://imgur.com/ECusJ)

It is written in C# so it needs the .NET framework or mono to run. For people running linux /OS X: It works with mono for windows, but i haven't tried it on any other OS yet.

WARNING. This version seems to be especially buggy. Multiple users reported crashes or just not starting. I'll look in to it and post an updated version soon. Thanks everyone for testing.

[DOWNLOAD v0.1.0 BETA](http://www.mediafire.com/?6zsi80bgzqez5di)


**Installation:**
You have to have  [.NET Framework 4.0](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=17851) or [mono](http://www.mono-project.com/Main_Page) installed.

 



Having ftldat installed is very much recommended. You can download it [here](http://westerbaan.name/~bas/ftldat/ftldat-latest.exe) -Thanks bas for this great tool.

On the first start, the tool will ask you whether or not you already unpacked your game files.


**How to use**

1. Load an ship existing ship with file&gt; load &gt; load Player Ship &gt; name. You can change the image,layout and shield with the 4th,5th and 6th Button

2. Position ship and shield with the buttons/text fields in the top right corner. Align your layout with the grid. You can turn the grid and comparison kestrel on/off with the last two buttons in the menu to help you find the right position. Loaded ships and layouts are already in the right position.

3. Add or remove as many rooms as you like to your ship by selecting the 8th and button. Click,hold and drag to draw a room. right click to finalize the drawn room. All doors connected with a deleted room are also deleted to prevent corrupt airlocks.

4. Connect your rooms with doors or delete them with the 9th and 11th button. Door placement should be intuitive now. Just move the mouse where you want the door to be placed an left click to put down.

5. Assign Systems to your rooms with the 14th-24th Button. Just select a System and click on a room. Only one of each system per ship , but you can place multiple Systems in one room.

6. Select the Weapon mount position by selecting the 12th button. Select which orientation you want for that mount. Click on the map to draw a mount, right click to finalize. You can remove them now with the 13th button.

7. Edit the systems in the ""Systems"" tab on the bottom left. The number in the box is the power that system starts with when you start or buy it. Check the checkboxes to select whether or not your ship should start with it.


8. Click the Weapon/Drone boxes in the bottom left to select the starting weapons/drones. Click ""Custom"" if you know the ""name="" of a custom weapon.

9. Customize your crew in the ""Crew"" tab in the upper right tab. You can also add and remove Augments in the ""Augments"" tab

10. Edit the Ship name etc. in the ""Ship"" tab on the bottom left.

11. Click the 2nd button to save the ship to a folder. Existing files will be overwritten. The tool will create subfolders. To create a .ftl mod file for GMM, simply zip everything in the selected folder.

Please consider that this is the first piece of software I ever released, I don't know what to include, so please excuse errors i made. Its also probably written pretty hacky, so excuse that ,too.

You will die, but you will swarm onto the enemy like an insect tide and tear them limb from limb. You will die, but ten more have already been born in the great birthing vaults of our homeworlds. You will die, but you die secure in the knowledge of our superiority over every other race in this galaxy! 

We are not by our nature communal beings, preferring the solitude of space and gorging upon our enemies alone. But we have united against the stench of all other beings. We will pour across their ships like cockroaches, scuttling through their corridors, and slicing through their crew like the meat-bags they are. 

The Humans can't stand against us. Their paltry laser pistols will break upon our carapaces as we feast upon their flesh.

The Engi can't stand against us. They shiver in their homeworlds at the thought of us! In the new order they will have a place chained and interfaced with our ships, enslaved for all time.

The Zoltan can't stand against us. Our ships burst through their pitiful shields where they hide fearful like the Engi. Their charged flesh has the consistency of a liquid as we cleave our way through them.

The Slugs can't stand against us. They too hide in their nebulae. We are not the only ones who smell their stench, for all despise them. Their bulbous, pus filled bodies burst in ever increasing numbers before our might.

The Rockmen can't stand against us. Although strong, every young Mantis fighter learns to tear them rock from rock until they are scattered to the winds.

Rock Cruiser B has a special place in my heart, despite the lack of airlocks and door system at the start, just because it looks so goddamn cool.  The hull design plus the color scheme is pure spaceship sex.

Mantis B is because of the four-person teleporter right next to the medbay plus starting with 2 shield layers.  I can forgive the lack of weapons because I can get those pretty easily, and once you get another two Mantis the only thing that can stand in your way is a medbay.  It's fantastic.

The sudden quiet hum of the energy systems on board was a shock after the absolute mayhem of just a few moments before.  One final swipe of the Pike Beam from our port weapon bay had sliced through the hull of the Rebel Mothership, causing it's starboard hull mass to crack off along the line of attack.  Moments later its automated FTL drive kicked in and it blinked out of sight.  The drones that had been engaged against us, suddenly lacking their powering ship and command signals, floated aimless outside of the ship, a [small cloud strewn about us](http://cloud.steampowered.com/ugc/560964212067977968/C6069FEC381372448E8E51C9C3B2B08CB11E7355/).  In the distance, you could see the larger battleships of the Rebel fleet, engaged in their own manouvers--but it was only a matter of time until they became aware of us and the damage done to them.

""Hull report?""

""Analysis shows slight damage.  No major damages.  No loss of hull integrity.""  Markus' voice was analytical, almost cold, but somehow comforting after all the time he'd been our helmsman.  One might think the Engi a strange race, but they certainly knew how to make this ship fly a lot better than our own Zoltan.  Far more precise.

I quickly pulled up a [full systems report](http://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/560964212067980609/69CD43F4E7D4DA436BB213A8B4AA1888890780F0/) from the weapons bay, my Zoltan brother watching over my shoulder.  I'd always been a much better gunner than pilot, and never understood why they put me in charge of this ship when we were called forth to assist the Federation.  When we'd rescued the Engi from pirates a few systems back and he'd proven his piloting skill, I'd gladly moved back to the targeting console near the forward nose of the vessel.

Everything looked well stocked and outfitted.  I did one [final check of our weapons and drone systems](http://cloud.steampowered.com/ugc/560964212067982164/EE8FB51FE88A0254B4664F3E516146C334D78408/), and made sure that our Zoltan Shield was well prepped to charge.  I remember when it had first been invented by our own engineers, harnessing the innate energy of travel over FTL to provide an overshield against any sort of malicious attack.  Genius, and often our savior.

""Caldwell here.  Engines are powered and we are ready for FTL.""

I turned away from the console and eyed those ships out in the darkness for another moment.  ""Markus, set course for the repair shop the next beacon over.  We can patch up and resupply there, then intercept the mothership well before it reaches the base fleet.""

""FTL engaging.  Stand by.""  That slight visual wrenching feeling as the drive engaged, a glow passing over the ship, the rebel fleet disappearing and the satellite repair station appearing just below us.  They were quick to read our broadcast ID, and had a few repair drones swarming over us as they beamed necessary fuel, drone parts, and missile pods on board.  Within about 20 minutes, we were patched up and ready to go.

I gathered the crew in the shield bay.  The three Zoltan, my brothers, energy emanating from our bodies and naturally powering the shield systems.  The rock Caldwell, large and hulking, slowly flexing his large fists.  The quiet Engi, Markus.  And the Mantis siblings, the finest warriors I'd ever seen, sharing a quiet if tense joke with each other.

""We one last jump to make.  No matter what happens, I am proud to have served with all of you.  Now let's take it to those Rebel bastards and make them pay.""  A cheer erupted from the entire crew, and as we went back to our stations, I couldn't help but grin.  But you could still feel a tension--we might not make this one.

Again, the FTL engaged, and the Rebel Mothership winked into view.  A huge hulking thing, powerful, but limping; both the port and starboard wings had been blown off by our previous efforts.  I gasped as I got a good look on our readout--the damn thing had a Zoltan shield!  This would not make things easy.

""Markus, keep us nimble.  I'm diverting primary power to the shields, stealth, and drones.  Mantis twins, we already wiped out their crew thanks to your hard work--but their automated AI looks to have repaired the weapons systems.  As soon as their overshield is down, you know what to do.""  Quickly, I tapped in the targeting systems and [engaged the ion blasters and pike beam to get through that overshield as fast a possible](http://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/560964212067984338/B56FA11085AB8218C9F679ED3EFFDF2B821F08E0/).  They may have been using our tech, but we knew it best.  The drones could be seen as they launched out of the ship, moving in an elliptical orbit, small turrets turning and hunting for any sign of attack.

Menacing, even half blown apart as it was, the Rebel Mothership quickly opened fire.  The first volley splashed against our Zoltan shield, missiles and energy beams  harmlessly impacting against the energy barrier.   The ion blasters and pike beam did their work, my hands quickly routing recharging power from the system back into them to get them firing faster.  Before long, their overshield was down--but so was ours from a second volley.

""Teleport NOW!""  The radio coms came back as the Mantis twins jumped over, quickly making work tearing up their missile systems.  But it wasn't quick enough.  Though the drones were able to shoot down two incoming missiles, a third pierced our shields and went straight for the engines.  The ship shuddered as an explosion was heard from the rear, a warning klaxon going off.

""Minor damages Captain, repairing now.""  As this was heard over the coms, the ion blasters broke through the mothership's shield.  My carefully aimed pike beam made its first cut [slicing through the central and foreward part of the mothership](http://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/560964212067989553/7DBAF2178EE1F5114C89F540E7B8512BCF69DC73/).  The Mantis twins chattered in glee as they finally tore the enemy missile systems to shreds and teleported back on board.  Another cut of the pike beam did a fair amount of damage to further systems on their ship, and you could see exposed portions of the hull crackling from the damage.

Suddenly, without warning, an energy readout on the sensors spiked.  ""What the...MARKUS!  ENGAGE THE CLOAK, NOW!""  Just in time, the view outside became slightly smoky as our ship vanished from view, and the Engi pilot executed an immediate roll, [dodging the huge volley of laser fire that had threatened to tear through the shields and cause major damage](http://cloud.steampowered.com/ugc/560964212067992234/0C00BF83C7CF3A1CA8573039BDA049CA77AE7EC9/).

Gritting my teeth, I targeted all systems on their ship, when the mothership's overshield re-engaged in front of my eyes.  ""The hells?""  The bastards!  They had managed to somehow store jump energy to the point of being able to re-energize the overshield.  I didn't have time to think.  Pumping further power into the ion blasters, we continued to pelt them.  Fortunately, we had done so much damage to their systems by this point that they were just a sitting duck.

With a final cry of victory, the pike beam sliced across their hull, [shattering it and breaking them up into a thousand pieces](http://cloud.steampowered.com/ugc/560964212067994852/C92530EE4470BEB7F12838389B79755417308598/).  At last, peace had found us.  At last, we could claim freedom for all.

At last, we were safe.

In the past few days we've had over 2,000 unique hits with over 7,000 page views.

For those of you who haven't subscribed, don't be scared to click that green button over there to the right that adds /r/ftlgame to your front page. We're going to have some great information coming soon.

First off, if you're new to /r/ftlgame and haven't picked out some flair, take a look over to the right on the side bar, where it reads ""Show my flair on this reddit. It looks like:"" and click the (edit) next to your username.

Next, let's cover a few items that have started to require a little bit of moderation:

**Spoilers**
With the game going live in 4 days time, we're going to have people wanting to discuss items that contain Spoilers. You're welcome to do this but please mark any of these posts with a SPOILER notification in the title. [Spoilers!], (SPOILERS!!!) or !!SPOILERS!! all work.

Please also note that inside a post, spoilers may be marked by formatting your text as such: \[This is the spoiler text.](/spoiler)

Any posts with Spoilers in the title will be removed. Posts that contain spoilers and are not labeled will be removed as well.

If you find either, please report them so that they can be removed.


**Begging/Pirating**
Faster Than Light is a game developed by an indie team - not a studio. The game is retailing for $9.99 (or other reasonable amount in your local currency). That's very affordable for the amount of content you receive for your *purchase.* For these two very good reasons, any posts or comments regarding pirating or begging for copies of this game will be removed. There were two instances of this yesterday and it needs to stop.

Save up your allowance, don't get the grande meal, pass on those two craft beers, go mow someone's yard, gather up cans and recycle them, go play your musical insturment of choice in public with a hat, ask your friends to donate $1 to your space exploration fund or go make some trades on /r/gameswap.

**Promoting /r/ftlgame**
/r/ftlgame was established to help share Faster Than Light with Reddit by a fan (me) and not by the developers. With that said, I'd like to support this game because 1. It's amazing and I can't stop playing it and 2. I'd like for it to continue to grow by selling many, many copies and giving the developers reasons to add additional content.

If you see FTL being discussed out there in /r/gaming, /r/games, /r/indiegames, etc - if you could, throw a /r/ftlgame link out there because /r/ftl is private but kind enough to re-direct to us, but it always helps to have a clear map.


**Updates to Sidebar**
Based off of the feedback from this post, I'll be updating the sidebar with the two rules outlined here and setting up a link to the Steam page for FTL as well.


**Anything else?**
If there is anything else you'd like to discuss regarding /r/ftlgame, this post is a great place to do so as I'll be reading the responses in here very closely.

Game is going just fine, nothing particularly interesting happens but I do get lucky a few times: I get my teleporter going before sector 1 is over and a second burst laser (using the kestrel) before sector 3. 

Eventually I get to rock homeworlds and come across the bulwark quest. I think ""It'll be a piece of cake!"", just get my engies and rockmen to keep the fires down, make sure they can't shoot back and wait for them to FTL away.

Suddenly, their engines catch fire, as well as several of their other systems. so what do the hyper intelligent rockmen do? Start putting out the fires in their shields and weapons and then repairing them instead of their engines.

""Fucking hell.""

What should have been a 1 minute walk in the park turned into 5 minutes of shitting myself as my hull damage slowly increased, sending my engies and rockmen across the ship putting out endless fires caused by both the sun and the rockmen ship and despretly trying to shoot out their weapons while trying not to kill them.

Finally, the rockmen fix their engine. I have never been so happy to see the words ""ENEMY FTL JUMP IMMINENT"" In the my entire life.

In my session today I came literally inches from getting the crystal cruiser, then I lost it because I am an idiot. The first half of my session went perfectly, finding the stasis pod and opening it in sector 2. This was shortly followed by a relatively uneventful Mantis controlled sector, followed by a Zoltan controlled sector (Which may or may not be where I actually opened the stasis pod, I don't remember.) Immediately after this, I jumped into the Rock Homeworlds, where I lost most of my hull. I soon jumped to a wrecked beacon, which I repaired, and then I jumped to the Crystal sector. After my next jump, I came across a [Crystal Scout](http://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/900987980407988232/768C57BA9F9591E6C2C3436074C4C0BB0BBEEEDE/) and nearly died, but I managed to beat it and receive repairs at the next beacon, which was a store. I was only two jumps away from the quest beacon, so I decided to explore a bit. However, I forgot that in the Crystal sector, the Rebel Fleet moves twice as fast as normal, and I ended up being unable to reach the beacon in time.

Over the past few weeks I've been seeing a lot of questions about beginner advice.  The following is a list of my most important tips (and they are closely related).  Also, I realize there are ""corner cases"" where sometimes these tips shouldn't be applied, but 9 times out of 10 they will give you a good start on Normal.

1.  Upgrade your engines over shields.  I usually get them to level 4 or 5 (fully powered) before I upgrade shields to level 2.  

2.  Always have piloting AND engines manned and level them quickly.  The combined +10% evasion is amazing, but it is almost gamebreaking once it is fully leveled to +20%.

3.  Don't level your reactor until you need the power for your engines, and you should rarely have your medbay or oxygen powered during battles.  If you are low on oxygen, divert 1 power from engines to O2 while the enemy isn't firing, and then switch the power back when the enemy fires.

**TL;DR Make sure your evasion is as high as possible before upgrading other systems.**

EDIT:  There have been a lot of responses about dealing with beams, upgrading doors/weapons/O2 etc.  What I have presented here is a *basic* strategy that you are free to modify based on your starting ship, crew, experiences in the first few sectors, etc.  It is meant to be a general rule of thumb that I have found to reduce my overall damage over a single FTL playthrough.  By all means, spend 20 extra scrap if you need Lvl 2 doors because you have weak crew that will be unable to handle a boarding party.  But these are minor details; having high evasion early on instead of shields is the single most important factor ON AVERAGE for reducing total damage.",,False,,t5_2tnu1,1358310930.0,,ftlgame-flairMANTIS,True,t3_16nigo,http://www.reddit.com/r/ftlgame/comments/16nigo/my_most_important_tips_for_playing_ftl/,

With that being said I think that this game can also use a few changes that could really help make it shine, nothing to the gameplay mechanics or anything, but just a few add-ons to the already spectacular game.
****************************************************

**Endless Mode**

I've seen this mentioned a few times in this subreddit, and someone posted a screenshot a few weeks back about how this game used to have a mode like this.  So why not bring it back?  Either have it as a stand-alone mode where you pick your favorite ship and have at it, or give the player the option to enter into this mode after they beat the flagship.  I feel like having either option would add a lot to this game.

**Sector Bosses**

The way I think this would work best is to have some sort of mini-boss at every exit beacon and have the battles with a few constraints.  Time limit, for one, so that you're not stuck fighting a enemy that you can't beat without a lot of luck.  Special weapons/equipment drop if you do manage to beat them.  Maybe another ship unlock as an achievement if you beat every sector boss in your playthrough?  I'm a little tentative on this one so if anybody has a better idea I'm all ears.

**More Weapons/Equipment/System Options**

I thought of this because what game wouldn't thrive on more options?  Yet, as I thought of it, I couldn't quite come up with any good weapons ideas that weren't in game.  The only one I could think of is a heavy pierce cannon like on the Shivan but maybe more like the burst laser?  I don't know.  As for equipment, perhaps specialized equipment that aid the stealth/teleporter cooldown comes right to mind.  Maybe for new system/subsystems we could have a . . . um . . . shit.  Again I'm all for ideas on this one, I thought something like this was pretty self-explanatory for add-ons anyways.

**More Random Events**

Who doesn't love more random events?

**Build-Your-Own-Ship Mode**

Ok, I think something like this would add tons of replay value to this game.  The way I imagine it is that you have a set value of scrap, say like 2000, and then you buy systems/subsystems/weapons/equipment for your ship.  So, for instance, take the Kestrel and you just add whatever you like as far as everything goes.  Burst Laser Mk II? Check.  Crystal Vengeance? Check. Zoltan Shield?  Well . . . there would obviously be a balancing act that would require some time but, why wouldn't you want to try and supercharge your ship?  Coupled with the endless mode?  [Well then.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYj7T9eEQ4U)  One caveat that I think is necessary, there would have to be 4 required systems/subsystems, and they are Engine, Pilot, Oxygen, and Weapons/Drone Control if only because every playable ship as at least those four.  So it goes without saying that those four would be for free with the exception that if you have Weapons and wanted to add Drone Control then that would cost scrap and vice versa.  (My idea would be a drone ship that starts with two boarding drones and two Ion Blast Mk II's, overpowered?  You bet your ass it could be.)
****************************************************
Ok so that's all I could come up with off the top of my head, Mr. Developers, if you are listening, I would totally pay 20 bucks for all this shit if that's fair to you.  If not, have your people call my people and we'll come up with something, like I said, I'm all ears.",,False,,t5_2tnu1,False,,,True,t3_15cvhh,http://www.reddit.com/r/ftlgame/comments/15cvhh/some_things_i_would_pay_for_to_see_ingame/,

Some tips to shift luck into your favor.,47,9,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/ftlgame/comments/10nv4l/curse_you_random_number_god_some_tips_to_shift/,"I've seen a fair few complaints about the game being too random, and while luck is certainly a factor in runs it's usually not the deciding one! Here's some tips to hopefully push luck a bit more in your favor.

* When going through zones, try to move in a way that sees as many nodes as possible. I've watched streams and seen them visit corners that don't link to anything they haven't already seen, and that's not good! Many sectors have guaranteed shops, often multiple of them, very often it's possible to see every (or nearly every) node in a zone to ensure you see these shops. Not only can you find shops this way, but also distress beacons which are often worth more than other nodes. Ensuring you use every jump you can before the exit is blocked is important, but so is improving your odds of seeing what you want to.

* Don't go to stores if you don't have meaningful amounts of scrap. Sure, maybe you could possibly buy that burst laser 2 that *might* be there if you sold every item that's not nailed down in your ship, but every jump to a store that isn't useful is a jump that isn't getting you scrap. If you aren't in serious need of fuel and don't have much scrap, just go to other nodes. Possibly move around in a circle if you can to see if you have some scrap on your way past.

* As part of the above tip, don't spend all your scrap on upgrades as soon as you get it! If it's not a life or death situation from upgrading a component, just don't spend the scrap. It could rain burst laser 2s in shops and it wont do any good if you spent every drop of scrap on upgrades that weren't entirely needed yet. There are also a number of nice events that require scrap. This is one of the toughest decisions in this game, however, as while passing opportunities can cause you pain down the line, falling behind the curve can get you outright killed. Just keep in mind that the most expensive item in this game is cloak/shield at 150, and the second most is Pre-Igniter at 120.

* Scrap spent on repairs is scrap spent not making your ship better! Always be mindful that any point of damage you take is scrap spent repairing. In addition to that however, is that you don't really need to full repair your ship every opportunity. If saving 20-30 scrap on repairs lets you get a new shield bar or even just holding more money for that next shop with a burst laser 2 it can be worth running less than full health in the long run. There are also a fair number of events that cause repair that may be completely wasted if you just max out every time you're at a shop. This is another personal judgement case, as running your ship in the red an entire run is needlessly dangerous. I personally aim for 2/3-3/4ths life but ultimately it will come down to personal preference and feeling of safety.

* Crew killing isn't just for boarders! Consider spending a little scrap on sensors 2. You'll find that even without boarders there's a fair few cases where you can kill the enemy crew even with plain conventional lasers. Ships manned by 2 or 3 people can often be cleaned out before the ship goes down. Sensor 2 also has a few favorable events that can let it pay for itself anyways.

* Hitting the helm and engines can be even better than shields. Sure, if you have a 4 damage volley and the enemy has 2 shields losing half your damage hurts. However being guaranteed 2 damage is in many cases a lot safer than the possibility of 4. If their weapons or perhaps a drone bay get repaired, being guaranteed to knock it out again is often better than just killing the target a little faster.

* Don't use excessive force, notably excessive consumable force. If you aren't at risk of taking damage from an enemy, and can kill them without using a consumable, do so. Sure, a two shield target and you only have a single burst laser 2 may take awhile, but if you keep missiles and drones for when you need them they should always be available. You can use that missile if they try to FTL or some such, but otherwise reserve it for when it will help mitigate damage.

* Don't always cloak for the enemy volley just because it fired. This applies primarily to laser volleys. If you have say 3 shield against 5 shot barrage. If you manage to dodge 2 naturally then there's no need for the cloak. Keep an eye on the shield and pause frequently if you wish, only hit that cloak if it looks like they can actually break the shield. Cloak is like a magical super-good-luck charm, use it only when it's needed. Or for missiles, because screw those.

Hopefully some of these will help some of you make your runs a little bit more consistent. I imagine these are obvious to some, but if any of these helped anyone I'm happy.",,False,,t5_2tnu1,1348913296.0,,ftlgame-flairMANTIS,True,t3_10nv4l,http://www.reddit.com/r/ftlgame/comments/10nv4l/curse_you_random_number_god_some_tips_to_shift/,

1347738565.0,34,self.ftlgame,zxsxs,I added hotkey functionality to the game!,43,9,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/ftlgame/comments/zxsxs/i_added_hotkey_functionality_to_the_game/,"hu[Good news everyone!](http://i.imgur.com/ii0up.jpg) 

I added some basic hotkey functionality to the game!  I made it so you can get to the ship page, the jump screen, open and close the doors, select your crew, and disable your weapons, all from the comfort of the keyboard! I mainly created this because I use a laptop and I don't like having to use the touchpad.


Now, it's not perfect. I just threw this together using AutoHotkey, so it's not actually built into the game as a mod or anything. This means that I had to use a sort of coordinate system. I gave the script hard values for where the buttons are, and the script moves your mouse over and clicks on them manually. It really works best if you use windowed mode. Also, you can throw it off if you move the mouse while it's clicking something for you. The total click operation takes about 1/5 of a second, so it's not too much of an issue. 

Here's how it works. If you have AutoHotkey installed, you can download the source file and simply run that. If you don't have AutoHotkey, download the executable. It will just pop an icon down in your system tray, and everything else should work fine. It's really easy.

**Key commands**

* Shift + Weapon Keys (1-7) will disarm / shutdown the weapon or drone
* qwe / asd / zx will select individual crew members
* f / g will fire the open/close all doors actions
* tab will open the jump menu
* ` (above the tab button) will open the Ship menu

**Downloads**

* You can find the source and executable here: https://skydrive.live.com/redir?resid=53AC9E9657ECC288!188

**TL;DR:** I added basic hotkey support. It's not perfect, nor is it an actual mod. It's just something to hold us over until real hotkey support comes out.

I started a game for the purpose of trying to get the crystal ship.  Very early on I find a few burst lasers.  Usually I like to play with the bio-beam (it is so fun!) but the lasers were too strong to pass up, and I wanted to try to get my last unlock anyway.

So I ditch the beam and breeze through to mid game.  I find the pod, the immediately the research station. I look at the map and there is one potential Rock Homeworld (red dot).  I aim for it, and low and behold it is the Rock Homeworld!  Then, you guessed it, I happened to find the portal and unlock the ship as well.

So there I am, in a slug neblua in sector 7 with 4 multi shot lasers of different strength and 2 auto reloaders, feeling pretty damn good. Then in classic FTL fashion, I looked at the map wrong and got stuck.  End result is going through 4 rebel controlled jumps and EACH TIME getting and ion storm.  EACH TIME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

By this point I am PISSED that I am dropping such a good game, but I am able to just barley get out of the sector with a few HP.  Long story short on the boss battle, it involved rushing to the boss after a dash to a repair station, a lot of luck, and getting repaired cloak in time to dodge the last super-weapon and win the game.

Commanded by a fearless crew of three, Debbie, Flip, and Russell, the Kruiser faced terrors previously unknown. An alien mantis that teleported onto the ship? Gunned down by Debbie in the weapons room. Pirates attacking stranded civilians? Day saved. 

Until we jumped too close to a sun. The warp beacon, the crew was told, had been placed too close to the sun and solar flares were imminent. A pirate ship, oblivious to the danger everyone was in, attacked at will. We traded missiles and lasers against a fiery sun. A solar flare hit and a fire started in the cockpit. No problem. Flip is great at putting out fires. Well, he was. Flip was a good man, no doubt. Why he didn't flee the cockpit in time is unclear. He fought to the bitter end, God bless him. 

The fire spread to the hallway. Debbie and Russell, one on shields and the other on missiles, managed to keep the ship in tact as it was rocked by more lasers. Incredibly, they were able to launch a massive missile, a Breacher, twice the normal size. The fire spread to the airlock control room as they watched their missile head towards the pirate ship. A direct hit and the pirates' vessel split apart at the seams, the explosion barely visible against the hot orange sun. 

The Kumbak Kruiser was victorious! Or so we thought. The fire, now engulfing the front quarter of the ship, spread into the med bay. Debbie and Russell, those beautiful people, could no longer seek medical attention. They both rushed to the med bay to put out the fires. Russell got there first, spraying valiantly with his fire extinguisher. Debbie got there too, just a few steps behind. But itwas a few steps too many. Russell was dying quickly. Debbie, ever the survivalist, left Russell to burn and ran out of the room. 

Only Debbie was left now. Sweet, sweet Debbie. The fire raged in half of the ship's rooms. Debbie was barely alive, a sliver of life remaining. She quickly realized the problem: She couldn't jump to another planet unless she was on the bridge. And the bridge was where the fire started. Rooms upon rooms full of fire separated her and any chance of survival. Debbie was going to die and she couldn't do anything about it.

So she ran to the very back of the ship. The airlock didn't even work anymore- a quick death would not be greanted. When the fire reached the camera control room, her vision of the ship went black. She no longer knew where the fire was. She waited alone, in darkness. The room grew red as the flames got closer. After thirty very long seconds, it came to claim its final prize. Debbie burned up, dead, just as the Kumbak Kruiser burst apart, spraying debris into the atmosphere of the sun, debris that would burn as quickly as the crew had.

God bless the crew of the Kumbak Kruiser. They were heroes to the very end. Except Debbie, who totally left Russell to burn and die.

--------

I decided to make a forum account and practice my writing after a particularly memorable campaign. This might be a bit long.

I bought FTL towards the end of the Steam Summer Sale after having it recommended by a friend, so I'm fairly new to it. I quickly discovered that the nature of the game lends itself well to my tendency to value the individual characters in my campaign - sort of like how a lot of people feel about their starter Pokemon, for example.

I might be a bit weird in that regard, admittedly.

After a few failed campaigns playing with crew named after Mass Effect characters which got me acquainted with the game, I decided, for a personal touch, to give the characters slightly more unique names (or as close to unique as my naming-impaired brain can come up with - I swear, if I ever have children and have to pick names, they are *screwed*). I got significantly farther on that first playthrough with those new characters than I ever had with my Normandy crew, though that was probably due more to luck than anything else. Nonetheless, I decided then that I would continue using the ""same"" crew, on the same systems I had them manning in the first campaign, until I managed to get to the end of the game.

As I played through campaign after campaign, though, I began to notice a trend: Davis, the crewman I had manning the engine room, was always the first to die.

*Always*.

Most of my campaigns ended with no crew deaths prior to the inevitable game-over... except for Davis. Whenever a random event decided to give me the short end of the stick; whenever an inconveniently placed deoxygenated room claimed a life; whenever a single missed click gave a boarding party the second they needed to finish off a fighter - Davis was inevitably the poor bastard who bit the dust. Every. Time. It's like his biography was written by Steven Moffat with a foreword by George R.R. Martin. A few times he even died within the first two jumps of the game. My own incompetence probably played more of a part in this than I'd like to admit, but then again, I figured that would cause my other two crewmembers to die before him at least a few times. But no. The solar system had declared Davis its personal punching bag.

After telling my friend of this pattern, I started comparing him to the redshirts from Star Trek, and Davis's amazing talent for dying quickly became a running gag for us. ""I'm starting a new game, now taking bets on how long Davis will last!"" ""Oh, wow, the Mantis I bought died one jump after we got him, even Davis thinks he's a pussy!"" And so on. If Davis weren't just a collection of pixels on my computer screen, I might have felt bad for the mocking we gave him.

It got to the point where, on the one occasion an original crew member died before Davis did, I thought something was wrong. Literally the first jump of that particular game led to a random event which I foolishly decided to chance, killing one of my crew members. But it wasn't Davis who took the bullet. It was my pilot.

In all of my previous playthroughs, Captain Pond had survived everything the solar system had thrown at her. She'd never died in a random event, she'd never been suffocated, she'd never been killed by a boarding party... She *would not* go down unless she went down with her ship. So hopefully you can understand my shock when all of a sudden she's casually killed off, without so much as a fight, before she could even get out of the gate - and Davis remains alive.

I wish I could say I continued that game. I wish I could say that I put Davis in the pilot's seat in her stead, and had him lead the Kestrel to victory against the Rebel flagship in her honor. But I didn't. I restarted the game then and there. I figured a campaign that kills the most invincible member of my crew in the *first ten seconds* has to be trying to make a statement - that continuing this run can't possibly end in anything but tears.

The *next* campaign, though.

By the time I reached the Last Stand, I had amassed quite a crew - one of every alien species except a Mantis, plus my starting Kestrel crew. Somehow Davis had survived all the way to this point, and gotten two stars in engine control while he was at it. I had planned this more as an attempt to unlock new ships than an attempt to beat the flagship - I had been well on my way to [unlocking the Crystal Cruiser](/spoiler), but couldn't find the [Rock homeworlds](/spoiler) in time. I had a Burst Laser II, a Hull Smasher Laser II, and a Halberd Beam. Not too shabby at all, but I wasn't feeling particularly confident in my ability to defeat the flagship, because I had gone up against it in an earlier game with that exact weapon loadout and still had my ass handed to me. I had a higher-than-normal collection of scrap, though, likely due to the extended amount of aimless wandering I had done in an effort to find the different ship quests. Almost all of it immediately went to power upgrades before I went into battle.

After a fairly easy and generic first round against the flagship, I braced myself for the drone phase, the one that always seemed to give me headaches. This game was no different in that regard. I had always had trouble dealing with the flagship's power surges when my cloak was on cooldown, so my only real hope for avoiding destruction was keeping my captain in the pilot's seat and Davis in the engine room, then crossing my fingers. This became problematic, though, when I had Davis leave the room to help my Rockman put out a fire faster. As if on cue, a boarding drone landed in the engine room, causing a breach as it started to shoot up my engines. I sent in my [Crystal](/spoiler) and Engi, the only free crewmembers I had left (Davis was in the med-bay healing off damage from the fires, and the rest were either manning or fixing broken systems), but they weren't able to fully kill the thing before the combined effects of the drone and lack of oxygen left them too weak for me to risk keeping them in.

As I sent the two to the med-bay, I decided I needed to slow down the drone enough to keep my evasion up for as long as possible. Davis was now at full health, so I sent him in. The drone was low on health, but not low enough, I thought, for Davis to take out before needing to retreat and giving the drone the last second or so it needed to damage my engines. As I watched his health closely between shots at the flagship, ready to pause and order him to haul ass out of there when the time came, my mouse hovered over his portrait.

As I looked at his character information, I noticed something I had somehow missed until then.

He had a green star in combat.

To some, it might seem like a tiny increase in damage. To me, it was like an entire [World of Cardboard speech](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfCardboardSpeech) without a single spoken word. Until then, I hadn't even noticed how often he'd been thrust into combat against boarding parties and drones in that playthrough alone. Thinking about it now, he had been up against every one of the several boarding parties that had been thrown at me - rarely alone, but always there.

And that just sums it all up, doesn't it? Since the very beginning, Davis has been punched out, suffocated, shot at, and slashed to pieces more times than I care to count. He's been infected with deadly viruses, eaten alive by space spiders, burnt to death in malfunctioning research stations, Benjamin Button'd by crazed Zoltan elders, and who knows what else.

But he keeps coming back.

He'll *always* keep coming back.

Because he's Jonathan fucking Davis, and this is *his fucking engine*.

The drone exploded. I don't know how much of it was due to the paltry 10% damage bonus from the combat star and how much was due to me poorly predicting the amount of health the thing had left, but nonetheless I found it impressive. There wasn't really any time to savor the victory, though - no amount of personal epiphany and unexpected badassery can prevent a guy from asphyxiating to death, so I immediately send Davis to the med-bay with barely any health left. My evade chance was kept intact for the rest of the encounter, and I avoided taking enough damage to be killed. After another few volleys of shots, the right side of the flagship broke apart, and I sent my crew in to repair breaches and damaged systems, beginning with the engine room. Davis settled immediately back in once oxygen refilled the room, and I jumped after the flagship, with low health but a hell of a lot of evasion.

It seems a bit anticlimactic to say the final phase went by rather uneventfully. Timing my cloak against the laser power surge was easier, with what felt like less penalty for screwing up. So I guess I'll just say when the enemy boarders teleported onto my ship, Davis was the one leading the charge against them.

With one last Halberd Beam sweep, and with about 5 hull left on my ship, the Rebel flagship was destroyed. The victory fanfare played (for only the second time, I might add) and the name of my crew was displayed on the screen. And for once, Davis stood atop that list - the Redshirt Who Lived.

From now until the end of the earth (or my interest in FTL, whichever comes first), whenever I have at least one human crew member, that guy will be Davis.

* Zoltan Shield is pretty much god mode for the first few sectors. It rarely gets popped before I've finished off the enemy ships. 

* I believe it has one of the only starting weapons loadouts that can kill the flagship -- Making it a good ship to beat the game with.

* Beam weapons are sooooo fun. Strafing someone's shields, engines, weapons, and other critical systems with one fell swoop is awesome. 

* Toggling your Ion Blasts back and forth between enemy systems can leave them with pretty much their whole ship disabled. 

* The extra power from your crew and cheap early reactor levels means you'll pretty much have no power issues the whole game. 

* Zoltan in general are an enigmatic race.. Who doesn't love galactic diplomats that only want to pursue balance and scientific endeavors?

It is most easily done with a slug interceptor, once you encounter one with energy weapons unable to break through your shields (or can deal with bombs or missiles till they run out) then you can knock out its engines (they cannot repair them) and just sit while your engine and shield skills on crew members slowly rank up. You can disable pause on alt tab while you do this if you want. FREE SKILL UP!  




But wait there is more! If you have a weapon unable to break through their shields you can shoot that at them all day to level up your weapons crew members skill without fear of destroying the ship.  




If you are a REAL min maxer, you can rotate your crew members to skill them up in all areas incase you lose one later.  




And when it is time to knock out the ship for good, knock out the O2 to kill of the crew (again they cannot repair it) and you can all that nice extra scrap plus the achievement if you don't all ready have it.  




As a side note, if you have a cloaking device, if you cloak when an enemy shoots its volleys, you seem to rapidly skill up in engines due to this.",,False,,t5_2tnu1,False,,ftlgame-flairHUMANMALE,True,t3_14aiji,http://www.reddit.com/r/ftlgame/comments/14aiji/crew_training_trick/,

But I think it'd be fun to control larger crewed ships, instead of a small cruiser with a crew of 8.

How cool would it be to have a legit bridge, with a captain, possibly first officer post, 2 pilots, weapons officer, shield controller all in the same room (would this be a good idea with boarders/fires? maybe so, actually).  Think about the bridge on Star Trek or something, or Battlestar Galactica.  You would still have true subsystem rooms (shields, weapons, med bay, engine) like FTL has now, and those would need to be manned first (ideally), but as the crew expands you can ""appoint"" officers to the bridge who boost their respective system performance further, and then at the top a captain and a first officer who have small boosts to all posts manned on the bridge.

I understand part of the excitement in FTL is the fact that you have to swap people around roles in combat when the s**t hits the fan, but even with a larger crew this would still happen.  There is excitement in Star Trek or BSG when the officers have to put in some time as grunts on an away mission, or someone gets hurt on the bridge and the first officer has to step in and man the weapons, or something.

The Drone system could either be replaced or amended with ""fighters"", operating somewhat indirectly like the drones do currently... you launch fighters, have pilots(?) you don't control them directly, but can have defensive assignments (defend ship from enemy fighters) or offensive (target primary enemy).

With a larger crew and a larger ship, enemies are of course larger, meaning breaches can be bigger, fires bigger. Medbays bigger, blast doors even more important.

What do you guys think? Naturally having too much to manage would be overwhelming, but I think a lot of the existing mechanics could work for something like that, and then the game becomes a little different from the Firefly theme and could become more like ST or BSG themed.

Honerable mention goes to the Osprey, but it's room placement is a bit wonky, and tends to screw me over.

Worst ship, in my opinion? The Noether. Piece of shit. It's starting weapons are decent, but having no shields is too much of a disadvantage. Sure, the stealth ship has no shields, but it has, you know, stealth. The Noether has the Zoltan shield, but it only lasts five hits.

I maxed out all my systems, got two drones, and was still overflowing with scrap.

In games where I've tried bulkier, more expensive weapons, I find that I never do as well. When you have to devote 3 or even 4 power bars to a single weapon, I feel like it's not worth it. Beams in particular seem very weak, though I haven't tried all of them yet. Since they're mostly ineffective until shields are down, you have to micromanage more, and the result is usually equal or lower damage than lasers or missiles (at a higher power cost). In particular, I can't imagine them working well in sectors 6+, where almost everything has 3-4 shields. Even targeting all weapons at the shield generator it's pretty hard to strip all shields for more than a moment.

What I'm looking for here is input on what is the best way to grind towards getting the right events. Here are my rules so far with my justifications:

* ~~Use the Red-Tail. I'm thinking this has the best offense early on to more quickly to blow through ships.~~

        EDIT: It has come to light that the Rock ships may be the best way to go. See comments below. 
* No boarding or otherwise milking ships for scrap. This takes too long.
* Head for Rock Controlled Sectors, Engi Controlled Sectors, and Pirate Controlled Sectors. I'm not sure if this is correct, but the FTL Wikia page says that's where you have to look to find the Dense Asteroid Field Distress Call. 
* Once in the right type of sector, try to cover all of the map in search of a distress beacon.
* Once you have the Damaged Stasis Pod, stick to Engi Homeworlds, Engi Controlled Sectors, Zoltan Homeworlds, and Zoltan Controlled Sectors to find the Zoltan Research Facility. Again at the advice of the FTL Wikia page.
* While looking for the Zoltan Research Facility, actively jump to ""uninteresting"" sectors; it helps if you have Long-Range Scanners to avoid fights. The idea is that this random event doesn't occur on the same systems as fights, stores, or distress calls. (Please tell me if this one isn't accurate!) 
* With the Crystal crew member, find the Rock Homeworlds and jump to all of the ""uninteresting"" sectors. Just like the above, for the same reason.
* If I'm halfway through the sectors and don't even have the Stasis Pod, I'm probably better off just restarting.

Again, this is to help me or anyone else get the quickest route to the Crystal ship. Please tell me if any of these rules should be altered or thrown away.

I'll post my tips and update this post with other people's responses! I primarily do Kestrel Normal runs, if you're wondering at the sort of ship I typically fly!

* The Kestrel has some very interesting possibilities in terms of anti-boarding. If you're happy to fly around with ~70-75% O2, you can open the entire middle corridor and even the very back bay of the ship. While enemies can still teleport into some other areas, doing this starts them taking serious damage instantly.

* Combine the above tip with Level 3 doors. Even if you don't, level 3 doors are amazing. I never leave first sector without level 2 doors minimum. The reduction in fire-spread is incredibly helpful, but it also makes venting boarders into space incredibly efficient.

* Never, EVER sell your Artemis. I know it might be tempting. I know that weapon might be juicy, or that crew member might be cheap, or you might ""never use it"". Hold onto that thing. It's a low power cost, fast charging weapon that **penetrates shields**. A single Artemis volley can be the difference between your hull being rent in twain and your enemies. Most useful for quick, strategic elimination of priority systems, namely shields, weapons and cockpit.

* Pulse laser's charge a bit faster than hull beams, but also have a travel time. Practice the timing to get it down and you can rend your enemies shields with your laser's, then deal maximum damage with your beam. It's worth holding off that little bit extra for your beam to catch up to your laser, in terms of charge.

* **Farm Sectors**. I know it's an in-game tip but it warrants repetition. Difficulty ramps up as you go through the sectors. Have a look at the map each time you jump to a new sector. Plan out the route you can go that will get you the maximum number of encounters. Skirt as close as you can to the rebel fleet.

* On the above, if your next jump is ambiguously safe from the rebel fleet and you have an option for a further jump, go for the further. It's not worth having to engage a rebel fleet ship. They give no loot and are uually quite difficult to beat.

* Before you go for your first jump of a run, remember to both power up your weapons/assign your power points and move your crew to the stations you want them at. You never know what you might get on that first jump, and this is the sort of game where the travel time for your crew could seriously affect how well your run goes.

* [From another thread, you can spread O2 to a room far more quickly than letting it recharge by opening doors to rooms that already have O2 in them. This spreads the O2 throughout the connected rooms.](http://www.reddit.com/r/ftlgame/comments/101zl1/trick_with_doors_and_o2_venting_i_havent_seen/)

* Shields are your friend. Assigning your beginning crew members is always a tough choice, but your hull is your most valuable asset. Anything that stands between your hull and your enemies weapons must be loved. I always put a crew on shields right from the start.

* O2 upgrades may seem less useful than many other things, but they're cheap and can save your arse. Faster O2 generation means your crew members can get into damaged, O2 sparse areas more quickly and take less damage while in there.

* Auto Pilot upgrades are a luxury. You will typically always have someone in your cockpit and in the very rare occasions that you don't, you could probably have used the scrap far better. Definitely far better spent on improved shields or improved doors.

* Learn your opponents weapons. The faster you can identify them, the faster you can make the strategic decisions you need to make about what to target.

* Fires and Breaches have tells, even when your sensors are down. If your ship is on fire, you can a) check your system icons (anything on fire will have a big fire indicator above it), but more importantly you can hear if your ship is on fire. This applies even if there are no system indicators (i.e. fire in empty rooms). Similarly, you can hear breaches, but they're more difficult to locate than fires. Try and keep track of where you've been hit by things like beam weapons and missiles, as these are your most likely locations.

* Drone control is expensive, but defense drones can shoot down missiles. Considering that shields are your only true defence and missiles bypass shields, defense drones are incredible. There are also plenty of other drone schematics that can REALLY help, such as the hull repair drone.

* Weapon Pre-Igniter's give you that oh-so-critical first salvo. Expensive and rare, these are absolutely incredible, because they charge your weapons instantly after a jump.

* Want to power-level your crew? Find an enemy that can't hurt you. Bonus exp for your weapons guy if you have an Ion weapon. Set to auto-fire, turn off ""pause on windows focus"", enjoy super-awesome crew! Cheesy but effective, not something I do (Because I'm hardcore GRRRRRRRRRRRRRR). [See this thread for the original!](http://www.reddit.com/r/ftlgame/comments/zyssi/how_to_max_out_your_pilot_and_engineer_early_on/)

* Mantis sectors suck. Slugs are worse.

* Your medbay is something that should never, ever be powered unless someone is inside it.

* Be careful with nebula jumps that halve your reactor output. The game likes to strip power out of your O2. Similarly, make sure after repairs to O2 that it is still powered.

* Hoard your scrap. At some point you will have to make a choice (repairs, upgrade shields/ship systems or spend at the store), but if you're sitting pretty for the moment, don't just spend scrap for the sake of spending it. For example, getting your second shield point requires two shield upgrades + power. That's around 80 scrap minimum right at the start (25 + 40 + 15, I think) and that's if you're only buying one bar of power. If you spend that 25 scrap, or that 15 scrap, that's a choice you can't undo, and the game may throw you a curveball where you needed that scrap for something else.

* Not really helpful, but a neat thing to know. Enemy missiles (also your missiles) can be shot down by at least laser fire and other missiles. Not sure whether other weapons like beams can do this too. [Check out this video for a REALLY neat example!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=um1zPzbRwO0)

From frsvm:

* Don't branch out too much. Stick with the strongest weapons system you find in the first few sectors and then build your ship around it.

* Explore. Never take the short route; try to visit as many systems as possible before the rebel fleets gets close. So much more scrap, material and items to be found.

* Never risk your crew. A lot of events have options like ""send over someone"" - this is often a 50/50 chance your crewmember won't return. 

* Always destroy ships instead of accepting surrender unless they're offering something you desperatly need (i.e. 6 fuel when you're running out of it) or when they offer a weapon/tech that'd sell for more than you'd get from destroying them (which is the case with most but the basic items)

* In combat, weapons system should be your priority in most cases. You usually can't stop boarding parties before they teleport, drones can often be dealt with, but weapons, especially missiles, will ruin your day. Take out their guns and keep shelling the subsystem so they can't get it up again.

* Several ""small"" ship upgrades are worth their weight in gold. Doors, for example. Level 2 doors make boarding parties manageable. Level 3 in combination with clever airlock and door cycling means you'll only have to worry about boarding drones; regular enemy crew will just suffocate.

* When you can, vent a room on fire instead of trying to fight fire with crew. It's much, much faster. But wait a while afterwards before sending your crew to repair as the room needs some O2

* If a shop has them, get Long Range Sensors. Makes picking up worthwhile targets (regular ships, distress beacons, quests) much easier, and helps avoiding nasty stuff (asteroid belts, stars)

* Get a lot of crew; the more, the better. More crew means more personnel for repairs, more people to deal with intruders, and most importantly, more people for extra dialogue options. ""Blue text"" solutions to scenarios will often reward more and better stuff, and most of them are triggered by having a diverse and large crew.

* If you can, get cloak early. It's expensive (150), but an amazing upgrade for both offense and defense. Cloak to avoid missile salvos, or cloak before initiating combat and open fire as you uncloak, taking down their weapons before they can fire a single shot.

* Focus fire dangerous subsystems first (such as the tri-missile launcher on a certain ship), or weapons systems on most regular enemies.

* Use enemy ship layouts to your advantage. Several ships have rooms that cannot be accessed at all; if you destroy these, they can't be repaired, or if you board them, the crew inside can't receive backup

From BroganMantrain:

* In regards to O2 upgrades, if you have extra scrap, this and things like the medbay are worth upgrading even if you don't power them all the time, just so they can take extra damage before being completely disabled.

From TrainerDusk:

* My favourite tip: Killing the enemy crew without destroying the hull will yield much more scrap and the possibility of a weapon drop. 

* Boarding parties consisting of 2 mantis/rockmen are better than any other race.

From ssercomic:

* Do not board auto-piloted enemy ships.

* They do not carry oxygen onboard and your crew will suffocate.

* Also, don't forget to beam your crew back before leaving a zone.

From DunkTheLunk:

* 1 tip: Keep Calm, Pause frequently, and Run Away if Necessary

From landroid:

* Missile management. Only use what is necessary to disable the weapons system in the early sectors since 90% of your encounters will be with only one shield unit. Losing the ability to fire your only shield penetrating weapon mid game can cause you to take quite a beating. Plus, you save lots of salvage for other upgrades.

From ElelloN:

* If you have teleport level 2, you can teleport 100 hp crew over to an AI ship and still have time to teleport them back before they die. I'm 90% surerockmen will survive with a level 1 teleport, but not completely sure.

From GreenZanbato:

* If the enemy has a cloak, be very careful when boarding them as you can't recall them while the ship is cloaked.

* Teleporting bombs, ions, and beams can hurt the zoltan super shield and beams often do 2 or 3 out of 5 damage to it.

* The game will often try and trick you out of cool things, especially when unlocking new ships. For example if you fight a slug ship, they surrender, and you get a let them live option with no reward next to it, you get a cool bio beam that kills enemy crew or some information. The bio beam is cool but the info leads to a quest that unlocks a fancy new slug ship. 

* If you happen to have a fire weapon and some rock crew, get yourself a teleporter and send your rocks in with fire, they're immune but it will kill enemies.

* If you're trying desperately to unlock a ship, it's best to look up how, because you're almost never going to get it without knowing the requirements. (a few exceptions here)

* Evasion is very, very, important. I usually get my engines up to 5 so with a level 2 pilot and engineer you get 45% evasion.

* If you haven't gotten a new layout yet, try to. It's not jut an aesthetic changing around of rooms, it's like a whole new ship.

* Try to learn the outcomes of certain choices. Some choices are always one or two outcomes.

From longdrinkmcg: **UNCONFIRMED**

* I power down my weapons before I jump sectors as I believe there are some fights which you can avoid by going into the sector without your weapons powered (and even get some help sometimes.) Mostly the events where you are mistaken for an enemy. If you are fast with the pause, it takes the same amount of time to charge your first volley either way, the Pre-Igniter notwithstanding.
