Was the article found? Tag it as the  with \[](/found) in your submission.

I'm not a programmer, so hopefully this works. If not, please let me know (or better yet, if you know how to CSS and would like to volunteer that would be super!).

I also adjusted the NSFW tag, so if you mark a post as NSFW in this subreddit, it will add a ""FOUND"" tag that is visible before opening the submission.

There's a presence of Library Science students on Reddit who would be willing to make a reference desk subreddit for those who are interested, but I'm just not sure if anyone is interested or not.

I'm not saying they are fraudulent, but I don't know where to have the discussion without suffering potential retribution. The papers are from the same lab.

The first problem is that two western blot panels in a Nature paper are identical. Nature v.482 p223 [pubmed](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22297846) see figure 2b. TCP(+) LSD1 and Tubulin are the exact same photo. This is possibly just sloppy science and I do not think it effects their conclusions. It is very sloppy however and needs to be corrected.

The second problem is another paper by the same author. In this western blot, three western blots of three different cell lines appear to be identical but different exposures or reprobes. It is possible that they are just extremely similar blots. If that is the case, then I commend them on their excellent technique. But in light of the other western blotting problem, the migration artifacts on these blots look identical. Cell v.151 p.62 [pubmed](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23021215) Figure 4a. The first and third blots seem to really have identical migration defects, but maybe they just have really good (better than me!) western blotting technique.

Once it migrates onto the web, it tends to stick: Google Scholar indexes it, CiteSeer both indexes and makes a local cache of the PDF, etc.

One way to help along the process is to have a web directory where you keep some papers for internal discussion in your research group, which you carelessly have linked openly without access controls. Nothing too crazy: don't upload 5000 papers into it, or do any sort of systematic uploading (like entire issues of a journal). Just some papers you're reading and find interesting.

In addition to a vague helping-people-find-knowledge goal, this is also indirectly a way of influencing research. Do you know of important papers in your area that damn kids these days aren't reading/citing? If they could find the paper on Google Scholar or CiteSeer, rather than the paper remaining buried in the dusty recesses of a journal archive, perhaps a few more of them would.

In my experience the risk there is extremely low. I've never been contacted by a publisher about doing this. Only one of my colleagues has received a complaint ever, and it was just a firm but polite, ""you seem to have a PDF of our paper publicly accessible on your wiki, please fix it"", which the person complied with and that was that. Unless you're doing something systematic, the risk of you being sued is near-zero (partly because of bad PR, partly because it's not even clear if they can sue you personally or would have to sue your university).

Of course, up to everyone what they feel comfortable doing, just a suggestion.",,False,,t5_2r0ev,False,,,True,t3_m9u71,http://www.reddit.com/r/Scholar/comments/m9u71/minor_civil_disobedience_suggestion_leave_a_few/,

Obviously, r/Scholar only really deals with articles that are available electronically; but there are many things - especially older articles and book chapters - that are only available in hard copy, and thus would have to be sent through digitized *scans* (or in picture form, from a smartphone).

So I guess I'm suggesting a place especially for something like book chapters...and for articles, if people aren't getting a particular request fulfilled here (and it's obvious that the reason for this is that the article hasn't been digitally archived yet).

I'm imagining that standard protocol for requests would be to post the WorldCat entry for what we're looking for, which shows a list of libraries near your location where the journal or book is available.

Alternatively... 

/u/RedditLibrarian made a [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Scholar/comments/17n87e/could_rscholar_use_a_reference_librarian/) a couple of days ago saying that he's an academic librarian, and that he could use his unique position to ""[post] a thread and [fill] (as much as possible) requests in the comments."" In the same thread, I had mentioned that a lot of my Ebrary e-book requests go unfulfilled; and yet there have been Redditors in the past who seem to have total access to Ebrary. 

So, in light of all this, would something broader like /r/Scholar_advanced be a bit more appropriate - something that could incorporate scan requests + more difficult requests, to be fulfilled by those with unique access to things?

Oh, and one final note:  I ""scanned"" an 800+ page book in **less than two hours** the other day, by taking pictures with my smartphone - so I'd even be willing to do a full book scan for someone. But perhaps there could be something like an ""exchange"" system for this, to make it more fair, and two people in need of scans can help each other out.",,False,,t5_2r0ev,1359937570.0,,,True,t3_17sxuu,http://www.reddit.com/r/Scholar/comments/17sxuu/query_is_there_need_for_something_like_rscholar/,

Identification of a novel human gene, ZFP91, involved in acute myelogenous leukemia.

Unoki M, Okutsu J, Nakamura Y.
Int J Oncol. 2003 Jun;22(6):1217-23.

**Abstract:**
To elucidate mechanisms leading to acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), to find sensitive markers and novel targets for drug therapy, and to allow choice of suitable chemotherapy for each affected individual, we previously compared expression of mRNA from mononuclear cells of AML patients with that of normal controls using a cDNA microarray. Data from that study identified many genes that were commonly up- or down-regulated in AML cells. Of these, we report here the identification of a novel gene whose expression was increased in 27 (93%) of the 29 AML cases whose PBMC preparations include &gt;70% leukemia cells. The gene product, localized in nuclei, showed several characteristics of transcription factors: five zinc-finger domains, a leucine zipper, and several nuclear localization signals. Its 92.5% identity in amino-acid sequence to the murine penta zinc finger protein (mPZf; gene symbol Zfp91), led us to term it ZFP91. Anti-sense oligonucleotides inhibited expression of ZFP91, suppressed cell growth, and induced apoptosis. Our results suggest that ZFP91 is likely to play an important role in cell proliferation and/or anti-apoptosis, and may serve as a molecular marker for AML.",PubMed,False,,t5_2r0ev,False,,,True,t3_1bm2ij,http://www.reddit.com/r/Scholar/comments/1bm2ij/request_identification_of_a_novel_human_gene/,

I am guessing the requesters aren't regularly visiting /r/scholar so they don't know about the new addition to the sub. Most of the providers are regulars; is there a way that we could be allowed to mark a post as [](/found)? This would also allow us to ask questions of the OPs for clarification as we wouldn't be using the lack of comments to indicate standing requests. 

Another possibility would be giving regular providers some sort of limited mod status that only allows them to mark/unmark posts as [](/found). People in a situation similar to mine (e.g. have a few minutes to help out while a centrifuge spins) can at least go through and mark fulfilled requests to help clear out the queue.

We fill this gap in the literature by experimentally investigating the effects of facial gender cues on stereotypical trait and application ascriptions to robots. As predicted, the short-haired male robot was perceived as more agentic than was the long-haired female robot, whereas the female robot was perceived as more communal than was the male counterpart. Analogously, stereotypically male tasks were perceived more suitable for the male robot, relative to the female robot, and vice versa. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that gender stereotypes, which typically bias social perceptions of humans, are even applied to robots. Implications for design-related decisions are discussed.

W. B. Yeats' ""Cuchulainn's Fight with the Sea."" BY Omidsalar, Mahmoud
American Imago, Vol 42(3), 1985, 315-333.
Abstract
Provides a psychoanalytic note to illuminate a curiosity in the poem ""Cuchulainn's Fight with the Sea"" by W. B. Yeats that treats Cuchulainn's fight with his son and the death of the son at his father's hands. Yeats gives Cuchulainn's son the same name, a seeming anomaly. Relevant details are supplied from Irish folklore, and an explanation is given that both Cuchulainns are aspects of the same person. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

A simple practical questionnaire technique for routine clinical use, the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) is described. One hundred and twenty patients with different skin diseases were asked about the impact of their disease and its treatment on their lives; a questionnaire, the DLQI, was developed based on their answers. The DLQI was then completed by 200 consecutive new patients attending a dermatology clinic. This study confirmed that atopic eczema, psoriasis and generalized pruritus have a greater impact on quality of life than acne, basal cell carcinomas and viral warts. The DLQI was also completed by 100 healthy volunteers; their mean score was very low (1.6%, s.d. 3.5) compared with the mean score for the dermatology patients (24.2%, s.d. 20.9). The reliability of the DLQI was examined in 53 patients using a 1 week test-retest method and reliability was found to be high (gamma s = 0.99).

I'm seeking to ground my politics dissertation in a theoretical framework. throughout i have taken a new classical economic approach (so i have been told!) it is based around a form of redistribution called conditional cash transfers, consequently, i need to justify why we should redistribute, but also focus on ensuring it is efficient redistribution.

Here is the paragraph: 

My economic assumptions are in line with a new classical economic theory. Whereby, market foundations are in microeconomics and individuals maximise utility, based on rational expectations. Due to the persistence of market failure and that not all actors are rational, CCTs become economically justifiable. The moral worth of attempting to create a more equal society through CCTs is founded on egalitarian beliefs. The argument is that the utility gained by the poor in creating a more equal society would be greater than the utility lost by the wealthy. CCTs do not only address material deficits in society, but also human capital deficits. As new economic growth theory suggests, human capital is an endogenous factor for growth. Therefore, societies utility is also improved as the reduction in poverty and increased human capital gives society the ability to produce more, and thus a higher standard of living will ensue.

While I am in favour of the concept of redistribution, doing so comes at the expense of economic efficiency. As famous economist Arthur Okun suggests, money is carried to the poor in a leaky bucket (Okun, 1975). Therefore redistribution cannot be done purely for the end of equality, but rather to maximise utility. To do this, one must ensure that redistribution is efficient and not harmful. It is here where my moral and economic assumptions converge.


Any help would be greatly appreciated!!
Cheers

A lot of journals add a watermark which contain the IP address/institution name
when you download articles.  This might be a concern for privacy conscious
people.  Here's how I remove it on Linux (the process should also work on any
\*nix style operating system).

1. You will need [`pdftk`](http://linux.die.net/man/1/pdftk) and [`sed`](http://linux.die.net/man/1/sed).
2. Use `pdftk` to uncompress the PDF file:
    
        pdftk article.pdf output uncompressed.pdf uncompress

3. Next, do a regex replace for your university name/IP address with `sed`:

        sed -e 's/.*&lt;search term&gt;.*//g' uncompressed.pdf &gt; article.pdf

4. You can also use `pdftk` to remove the first few pages which might also
   contain some information.

        pdftk article.pdf cat 2-end output final.pdf 


Hope this will be useful to someone!  Remember, information wants to be free!

I am giving a persuasive speech for an Intro to Speech class and have chosen to try and convince a mainly older and non-traditional group of classmates that we need to stop cutting NASA's budget. 

I only get 5-7 minutes, so I'm keeping it fairly simple and choosing to focus on the fact that space and astronauts and starstuffs are about as good as it gets when trying to attract kids into science and technology. I am heavily influenced by Neil deGrasse Tyson ([this video in particular](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQhNZENMG1o)) but I'm having difficulty finding strong, print sources (which are required) to really drive the point home.

I am hoping that someone could possibly point me towards some resources or a couple of really great journal articles. I know in my gut I'm headed in the right direction but I need assistance in finding sources that will lend real credibility to what I'm saying. To give you an idea of the ""feel"" of my speech and kind of what I'm reaching for, I'd like to share my conclusion below. Thanks in advance for any assistance you can offer.

*There is a Serbian proverb that says, ""Be humble, for you are made of earth. Be noble, for you are made of stars."" I implore you to take your children, your brother or sister, your niece or nephew, outside to look up at the clear night sky. Hopefully they feel the same wonder our ancestors felt, and the same desire that we, as a species, feel to explore. These are the qualities that create scientists, and I believe that we have no greater ally in this endeavor than space.*",,False,,t5_2r0ev,False,,,True,t3_hlj39,http://www.reddit.com/r/Scholar/comments/hlj39/giving_a_speech_on_the_importance_of_funding/,

I'm a student of American studies / cultural studies in Germany and I'm about to write my bachelor thesis (35-40 pages). 

The main components should be 'TV shows' (maybe something like 'Suits', 'Modern Family', 'The Middle', 'Two And A Half Men' and/or 'Breaking Bad') and 'gender'. 

My professor said I could write about ""the tension between aesthetics and politics of modern TV series - to what degree are contemporary high gloss TV series just a polishing of relatively conservative topics, such as gender"". 

I don't really know what to make out of this. What is meant by 'politics of TV series'? Can someone give me a jump start here? I don't know whether I should start researching within this topic or go for something completely different (still in the realm of TV series and gender though).
