Thanks for the great response. I figured you guys might like an update. The two main suggestions were to sue the estate or leave it alone and forgo rent.

Instead I found his obituary and used that to find his son in the phone book. I called up and reached his wife. I explained that rent was owed and she said ""No problem, we were talking about doing that."" I got the rent check a couple days later, as they were cleaning out his stuff.

So I found a third way - didn't have to sue anybody and didn't forgo the rent. The family was really cool about it, which made things easy in the end.

This is why buyers and sellers should be kept apart.,59,8,55,http://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/1epj3b/awkward_time_with_sellers_before_close_this_is/,"We met the sellers at their house before close (nine days out) so they could go over some maintenance items. This was arranged by both of our agents – and in hindsight, should never have happened.

Thus far, the sellers have been easy to work with during this whole process. However, while we were there, they told us they don't want to part with most of the furniture that they agreed to sell in the contract, and wanted to buy it back. Their offer was very low and not anything I would even consider.

I found out later that their agent knew that they didn’t want to sell the furniture and had admonished them not to bring this up, since they already agreed to sell it. Despite being highly educated, it appears they don't have any real concept of the nature of a contract. 

We didn't agree to anything and told them we would discuss it and let them know our decision.  After we left, we immediately agreed there is no way we will sell it back. Our agent talked with their agent this morning, and the seller’s agent claims to have the sellers reluctantly onboard with honoring the contract.

The real lesson here is that there are good reasons to keep buyers and sellers apart, and this is a great example. I told my agent, I would never have gone to their house knowing we would be blindsided by the sellers. Also note that the sellers never tried to open up negotiations through the agents – they instead tried to go straight to us, thinking it may work in their favor.

Basically I have a lot of insight in how to best navigate the process and how to make the right impressions so that your deal has the best chance of being funded. A lot of it really rests on proper presentation, knowing the lingo, talking the talk, and of course, having a real deal.

**UPDATE #2** There was a comment regarding this being an upsell to a seminar. Frankly, I don't know what I will charge yet, or if I will even charge. Depending on how much effort I put into the course, I will decide upon the fee structure, if any. Frankly, the more positive response I get from people, the more motivated I will be to share this info and to structure the contents into a format that will be most beneficial. 

One thing is for sure, my main goal is to highlight and put into key actionable steps the HUSTLE I did to get funding for my deals. And believe me, there is a lot of hustling in real estate. At the end of the day, however, if you don't take action on the steps I lay out, everything will be for nothing.

I own a 4 unit building in Chicago, 3 are occupied.

Last month the City Water Dept sent us a bill in the amount of $3,000, claiming 230,000 gallons of usage.

230,000 gallons is a metric shitton of water to use in a 4 month period, we sent out a tech who found a running toilet in the vacant unit.

According to the EPA a constantly running toilet uses 200 gallons per day, or 24,000 gallons over 4 months: http://www.epa.gov/WaterSense/pubs/fixleak.html

It's just impossible for 230,000 gallons to just go unnoticed, if it was another leak it'd be visible.. How can we dispute it?

The second problem is, how can the bill even be $3,000?

The City of Chicago water rate is $2.89 per 1,000 gallons, so 2.89 * 230 = $664.7

Plus sewer (92% charge of water) $593

So the MOST the bill should be - even for 230,000 gallons of usage is $1,237

What can we do/how do we dispute the charge?

Any advice? I'm freaking out here!


Edit: Bill is definitely 4 months, the meter was first read Apr 30th then end of June. We don't have any historical usage figures.

Edit 2: We've been on site to the Water Dept office, they don't seem to give a shit: they offered us a payment plan to pay off the usage...

Is there an ombudsman or some other dispute resolution we can escalate this to?

However, there is often confusion about what the OP means when he or she says it. So here are the 4 *basic measures of worth that are commonly used in residential property. There are of course others that most consumers will never encounter.*

* **Assessed value** is what your local assessor's office says it is worth. *Depending on state law, it might or might not be related to market value.* It is adjusted periodically, either by estimating price changes or by a formula; either way, this is mandated by state law. For example, Nevada has a cap on how much this number can go up in a year. If you think your assessment is out of whack, each county has its own appeal mechanism. Search for ""Assessor [your county and state] appeal process"" for more information.

* **Taxable value** is based on assessed value, and may be adjusted by a formula created by your state. *In a few states, taxable value is equal to assessed value, but this is not always the case.* As you can guess, your property tax or ""millage"" (that's tax per $1000) is based on this amount. Search ""[your state] taxable value"" for more information.

* **Market value** is [defined](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_value) as ""the estimated amount for which a property should exchange on the date of valuation between a willing buyer and a willing seller in an arm’s-length transaction after proper marketing wherein the parties had each acted knowledgeably, prudently, and without compulsion."" In short, what a buyer and seller agree is a fair price. It has absolutely nothing to do with assessed value, taxable value, or Zestimates. 

* **Appraised value** is what a licensed appraiser establishes a property is worth. *This is often but not always* for purposes of a lender justifying a mortgage amount. *If it is based on another metric, the appraiser will outline what method is being used. When used for mortgage purposes,* it is supposed to be based on market value by way of comparing the subject property to available and recently sold similar properties. This is obviously easier in a subdivision where there are dozens of basically identical homes and harder if there is anything unusual about the property, however there are a set of formulae that appraisers use to make all things relatively equal. Briefly, this is the absolute maximum the bank will lend you. *It is not uncommon for the appraiser to decide that market value is different than the price a buyer and seller have agreed upon.* This is what gives the vast majority of OPs a problem! 

*There is another value that consumers use, but real estate professionals almost never rely upon called an Automated Valuation Model, or [AVM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_valuation_model) for short. These numbers are produced by a computer model based on certain assumptions. It is not prepared by an appraiser or a real estate agent. Often, AVMs do not account for property condition, upgrades, or distressed sales -- three issues a real estate professional should try to consider. A Zestimate is an example of an AVM, and it is a proprietary number calculated by Zillow. Zestimates are considered* for entertainment purposes only *by most real estate professionals.*

1352836775.0,46,self.RealEstate,13505k,How to Get Rid of Bed Bugs Cheaply (From a Landlord),53,7,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/13505k/how_to_get_rid_of_bed_bugs_cheaply_from_a_landlord/,"Before we begin, fuck bed bugs. Man I hate those bastards. I lived in few for many years of getting them in my apartment complex, and I finally did earlier this year.

I tried a number of consumer sprays, bombs, and the like, but my tenants were still getting bit. I am also supremely cheap so paying $600+ PER apartment for a pro to do it is just not an option. They were quoting $150+ per spraying and they needed at least three treatments. Or the heat treatment would be about $800+ but be one time. You bet your ass I'm gonna see if I can DIY it before spending that kinda cash.

When I started using the method detailed below, within two nights, nobody was getting bit anymore. It was a fucking miracle. And my total per-apartment cost over the lifetime of the treatment is *maybe* $20.

###Here's what you do:

1. The tenant needs to keep their apartment clean and tidy. Makes it easier to spray. They should wash their sheets and clothes regularly and clean/vacuum regularly.

2. Buy Gentrol insect growth regulator ($80). It keeps the larvae for becoming adults. Once the eggs hatch, the thing can't ever grow up. It's fucking awesome.

3. Buy Temprid SC ($90). This is the pesticide which will linger and kill the actual adult bugs. There are some other good pesticides which work well too, but I use this one. Suspend SC ($40) is a cheaper one which I might start using full-time.

4. Another good thing, but you don't have to use it is diatemaceous earth ($10). It's a powder which is totally safe for humans which murders bed bugs. It cuts open their exoskeleton so they bleed to death. You basically sprinkle this all over the place, particularly places they would hide and they walk through it and die.

5. You can buy a lot of this stuff on Amazon in concentrated form, but places like [domyownpestcontrol.com](http://www.domyownpestcontrol.com) also sell them.

5. Mix the proper amounts of Gentrol and Temprid (it's about 1oz each per gallon of water IIRC) into a pump-sprayer ($20) and shake it up then you spray the fucking shit out of the apartment. Not just around baseboards, but everywhere they could hide. All around nightstands, the seams of mattresses, couches, and pillows, tables, door hinges, etc. **Every-fucking-where.**

6. I would recommend wearing a ventilator while you do this and follow all safety protocols on the bottle. Once the stuff is dry, it's safe for humans.

8. Do the treatment again two weeks later and then two weeks after that. After that, you're probably cured, but I still spray once a month in the affected apartments, albeit less vigorously just to be safe.

Your total start-up cost is about the cost of one pro treatment and you'll be able to treat probably 15-20 apartments with your first bottles of chemicals. It takes me maybe 10 minutes to treat an apartment and the tenant needs to be out of there for a few hours IMO for the stuff to dry.

We manage about 430 residential rental units, as well as condominiums consisting of about 1500 units. I just had to evict someone after a long drawn out process. They left the place a mess, caused significant surface damage (kids drawing on walls, etc.) as well as some poorly patched holes in walls, etc. There are still a lot of personal belongings in the house.

The owner is furious with my company because of the state of the house. It was a pretty nice house before the tenants moved in, and will be again once some cleaning and repairs are done. We did our due diligence to screen the tenants before they moved in, but even property management companies can be fooled.

Once we determined that it was time for the tenants to be evicted, it was about a six week process to get the eviction to go through. In that time, they really let the place go. There is really nothing you can do to prevent that. All you can do is have the recovery costs added to the judgement against them after the fact. Whether or not you can recover some of those costs, is another issue. This eviction cost the owners about $2000 in legal fees. My company is splitting the cost with the owner, and we are doing what we can to help get the house ready to rent again.

1367369272.0,37,self.RealEstate,1dg7wa,I've seen a few people coming through lately asking what they can do to help get their business off the ground as agents. Here's what I know:,47,10,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/1dg7wa/ive_seen_a_few_people_coming_through_lately/,"I've posted this previously, but it's buried further down than Jimmy Hoffa. I invite others to add to this. Remember: Making money is real estate is fairly simple: Lead generate daily, and set qualified appointments. 

I’ve been asked by a few Redditors to comment further on ‘lead generating’, and what exactly it is from my perspective. First off, I’ll reiterate my previous sentiments that my lead generating time is as important, if not more so, than my listing appointments. The reason is that without lead gen time, I will have no listings, and, “He who lists, lasts.” It’s that simple.

So what is lead generating? Lead generating is the process of contacting people to try and get new business going. It can mean contacting people that are either in your database currently, or contacting people you haven’t met in order to feed and grow your database. This is done through a variety of methods, including contacting For Sale By Owners (FSBOs), expired listings (those that were listed, and the listing period ended with resulting in a sale), calling on people in your database and asking who they know that is thinking about buying, selling, or investing that you can call, going to garage sales and talking to the owners, etc. There are endless ways to lead generate. I have yet to come across a real estate company that provides its agents with a list of leads to call daily, mainly because there just aren’t that many leads that fall into brokerage’s laps. There are plenty of people that want to buy and sell; you just have to be able to find them on your own.

One more very bold way of lead generating is (get ready for this one) calling the agent who has the expired listing and offering them a 26.2% referral fee if they’ll send that seller over to you. Many listings that expire can become much harder to work on, and this way, the original agent only has to sit back and relax while you go out and list and sell the house. Then they get 26.2%. Why 26.2%? Because it’s a pattern interrupt. When you’re talking to the original listing agent on the phone, you want to really capture their attention to keep them from rejecting you and not listening. When you say 26.2, they’ll silently wonder why.

When calling expired listings, you have to keep in mind a few things: First, these are people who want to sell their house, but it just didn’t sell for some reason the first time they had it on the market. You have to call them and see when they plan to hire the right agent for the job to sell their house. Make an appointment with them where you can just take 15 minutes of their time to show them what you do to get houses sold. At that point, you can get in the door and get the listing. The second thing to remember (and you really need to tell yourself this over and over before you start calling) is “They’re home, they’re happy, and they want me to call.” It’s true. And if you don’t call, your competition will. Who do you want to have the listing? You, or your competition?

FSBOs are also a great source of leads. Many FSBOs are willing to pay a buyer’s agent a commission to bring a buyer; they just don’t want to pay a listing agent and a buyer’s agent. If you can convince them to pay just a little bit more commission to hire you, you’re in the door. YOU DON’T WANT TO CONVINCE THEM ON THE PHONE. When on the phone, all you want to do is set the appointment. The way to do this is to ask what they are doing to market the house. Offer to meet up with them to show what you do to get houses sold, because they may be able to use some of your techniques to help themselves. “I could come by tonight at 3, or would 6 be better?”

FSBOs want to sell, but they also want to buy. Find out where they are moving. If they are moving in the area, you can help them. If they are moving out of the area, you can refer them to another agent.

When calling people to add to your database, you should be making a minimum of 20 contacts per day. A contact is defined as talking to a decision maker in a household or business. It doesn’t mean leaving a voicemail, or talking to a child.

The Yellow Pages are another great source of leads. Open the YP and find a few businesses. Call them, ask for the owner. After you introduce yourself, tell them that you like to do business with people in the local community, and you’d like to stop by and meet them face to face. At that point, you can get their business cards, and give them a few of yours. Chances are good that someone in the business will have some real estate need, or they know someone who does.

So what’s all this about putting your leads into a database? You do this because for every 12 people you have in your MET database (that’s people you’ve met face to face at least once) you can expect at least one transaction per year. 144 contacts should work out to 12 transactions. For every 50 people you have in your UNMET database (this is people who you have in your database for when you do mail outs to a subdivision or people who you are friends with on Facebook, but have not yet met, etc.) you can expect one transaction. CAN is the key word here. It requires action on your part in the manner of actively contacting the people in your database. You should be contacting them at least 2-3 times a month, in a rotation of email, phone call, personal visit, post card in the mail, and otherwise. You want to convert your unmet people to mets, so get our and meet folks. You want to keep in front of all of these people so that when they think real estate, the first thing they think of is YOU. Think about it, when you think of beer, or a car maker, or a place to eat a hamburger, chances are you have a brand name that pops in mind right away too. Why? Because they stay in front of you.

Those are the very basics of lead generation. It’s the most vital part of this business, so be sure you do it EVERY DAY!

Since we periodically get questions about these auctions, I am going to share some of this information. Remember, I'm not making a dime on this and self posts don't give karma. *Any*way....

There were 2291 trustee sales scheduled last month, although that did not represent almost 2300 individual properties. That's over 100 per business day on average. Of those, **49% were postponed and another 25% were cancelled altogether**. This happens pretty much every month. Why might a sale be postponed or cancelled? Short list includes but is not limited to:

* Short sale was completed

* Bankruptcy court intervened

* Deed in lieu of foreclosure was completed

* A miracle happened

* The owner came up with all the money owed to the bank, either by winning the lottery or by refinancing

* The bank realized they were missing paperwork

So that leaves **only 26% of scheduled foreclosure auctions actually happening**. Because we have a lot of active investor action at these sales currently, 15% went to a ""third party"" and only 11% went back to the bank.

If you decide to buy at these auctions remember these facts:

* You'll need cash. A stack of money orders works best. 

* You might not be buying the property free and clear, so you'll need to research that before you go.

* You won't have the opportunity to tour the property before hand beyond maybe looking in a window.

* It's up to you to know what comparable properties are ""worth"" before you go.

* There's a good chance that the property you were interested in won't actually sell that day.

* There's a lot of savvy investors there who know the system better than you.

Edit: I get it, don't buy a crackhouse.  

But if you look at a lot of those properties and do the google street view, you'll see that they are mostly abandoned places. They are on streets that are completely dilapidated, like the area in sim city that you just bulldoze down and replace with nothing.

The most interesting ones are the little $1000 lots.  The lots are all littered and nasty in the pics, as if the seller didn't even dare get out of the car long enough to move the trash out of the way. Most of those are not foreclosures because it's just land.

But what I'd be interested in is the land mainly.  No matter what's going on in this area right now, you're talking about owning a piece of land in a major population center. Who knows what could happen to detroit in 20-30 years. They could invent robocop and clean that place up. Worth a $1000 gamble? Plus ~$15/year in property tax.

In the meantime you could buy one of these little lots, put down a swing set for the community or plant an oak tree and stick a bench there commemorating your grandmother.

    I was asked by people [in this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/z2d1n/real_estate_agent_asking_for_compensation_even/) to make an update.

So what happened was that this real estate agent was asking me for compensation even though I DID not sign a contract nor was I told of any obligations. 

The person was threatening me to pay otherwise he would send me to court, he was basically extorting me for 300$. I was quite shocked and confused because I had already gone through with another agent and a lender and this really made me depressed.

I asked a lot of people around me and including this subreddit for advice and everybody said he was talking nonsense. My cousin had a friend in the business and he told me straight up to contact the managing broker and tell him everything keep it short and to the point.

So finally I contacted the managing broker and he was quite shocked that this particular agent was asking for 300$ and he promised me that the agent will stop threatening me and he will personally look into this matter.

So It has been a week and no letters or anything. So I just want to tell new home buyers that if you receive such threats or anything from Real Estate agents who ask you for compensation without a contract always refuse and ignore them. You are not obligated to pay any agents what so ever if you are the buyer.

I'm looking to compose a very concise list for prospective buyers; most amount of info in the shortest sentences. It's a starting point for new buyers, the basic of the basics. There're plenty similar lists online, but they're paragraphs and end up pages long and give too much details. 

These are the expectations one should know before one even thinks about owning rental properties. 

PLEASE HELP ADD, THANKS!
Here are a few to get started. 

* 2.5% goes to agent each time you buy or sell. Take that into your account when calculating ROI. 

* You can't just rent anything. Rent has to be within the local price range to have good demand. Renters tend to be poorer people. 

* Usually experienced rental property owners own a couple properties. 

* You can leverage your money, most do. About 25%down. 

* You likely won't qualify for a loan as a first time buyer unless you already have steady income, so you need to go all cash. Even if you qualify, you won't get best rate. 

* The loan terms won't be as favorable as what you get for your own primary residence. Commercial property loans are different. 

* Cash flow and appreciation potential are inversely related, generally speaking.

* Rent should be no less than 1% of value per month if you're looking for cash flow. 

* Coastal properties bring in less rental ratio, but higher appreciation in general. 

* Property management can do almost all the management. Expect about 10% fee. 

* Expect about 10% vacancy. 

* Don't forget about property tax of HOA dues. % vary. 

* Dont' forget your rental income is taxed as normal income, about 30%. 

* When you sell the house, the capital gain is taxed too, 15% if held for over a year. 

* Bad tenents can happen, though rarely, expect a 2-3 month of rent loss to evict them, not including potential damage. 

* You will be competing against pros and many amateurs. Foreclosure auctions aren't as easy to make money as they make it to be on infomercials.

He is moving to a retirement community and had been procrastinating on selling the place. Neither he nor I have real-estate agent representation. I had the simple sales contract drawn up by a local attorney. I jumped at the opportunity for obvious reasons. He also actually told us that the very low price was the maximum that he would sell it for. He dismissed the notion that it was actually worth more when I suggested it to him. He's a humble man. Ultimately, I didn't fight him too hard because the deal was so unbelievable.  He trusts me and he has expressed that he's happy to see a young couple move into the place he's owned for over 30 years. When we signed the contract - both parties fully understood the agreement and were very happy. He was happy to have lifted the burden of selling his place. My wife and I felt elated to be on the path to home ownership. 

However, now that the rush to sign a contract has ended, I feel a deep conflict about the situation. Did I just rob an old man of the equity in his home? Should I have pushed harder to make the deal more equitable for both parties? Did I dupe him on a 'neighborly deal'? Does he really not know what the fair market value is for his property?  As a man almost 80 years old, perhaps his motivations are just different - not dollar driven. 

Now, I'm considering sitting down with him and asking whether or not he's leaving himself with enough money from the sale of this house to continue to live on where he is going next. I want to thank him and tell him how much this means to my wife and I make sure that he's comfortable giving us such a deal. I don't think he knows how much his place is really worth. We don't have to do any of this - obviously - the contract has already been signed. 

Should I give him the opportunity to break the contract and negotiate the price UPWARD? Or is ignorance bliss? If he's happy and we're happy has any wrong been done? 

What's the right way to show this man the respect he deserves?

********
Edit: I spoke with the seller about the possibility of the home being appraised for much more than the selling price. He said he'd rather not know what the final appraised value is and reaffirmed that he is happy selling at the agreed upon price. He made it clear that he knows roughly what it will appraise for. Then he quickly changed the subject and offered me his antique gun collection and liquor stash. As a friend said, this deal is breaking all sorts of worldly rules.

-No carpet, ever. Too short of lifecycle.

-Great ventilation - bath fans that really move the air to prevent mold

-Hood fan for stoves

-Undermount sinks or one-piece sink/vanity top (easy to clean)

-Toilets with overflow drain: http://www.penguintoilets.com/

-Washable paint

-Washer and water heater pans/drains

-Solid surfaces instead tile on counters/backsplash

-Real wood/plywood instead of pressboard cabinets

-Pex instead of copper (less worry about freezing)

-Corner protectors on outside corners

What else am I overlooking?

Also, do you go with shower curtains or the sliding door setups?
Wood floors or laminate?

Edit: Just FYI my strategy is pre-War classic homes to rehab and rent, and add nice higher-end finishes to attract the best tenants and premium rents. I worked in property management and people beat a path to the door to rent the nice, cute, character places, while generic, bland postwar rentals went much more slowly (and for much less money).  Pre-war classic houses don't need the constant updating like postwar rentals either, and they tend to be more solid to begin with.

I realize that this is just a data point, but wanted to share my story about how a good buyer's attorney saved my home purchase.

First, she gave me an incredibly thorough rundown of the area I was looking to purchase in (Sleepy Hollow, NY). Everything from schools to taxes to town history to events in the future that could affect the town. And this was for a village of only 11,000 people!

I'm a first time homebuyer and she took the time to explain just about every real estate term out there to me. She went through all the positives and negatives of homeownership to ensure I was ready. She put me in touch with a mortgage broker (friend of hers who I didn't end up going with but got a pre-approval from). She also explained all the local real estate customs, which vary quite a bit.

After I picked out a house, my lending bank (guaranteed rate) was taking FOREVER to issue a clear to close. 3 weeks went by, I checked in every day, and soon the contract was in default. She spent an entire day calling people at the bank and the mortgage broker, issuing threats and countering their bullshit reasons for why it was taking so long. She finally contacted the president of the mortgage broker and someone high up in customer service at the bank and explained what this delay would do to both their reputations in the area. Later that day the clear to close was issued.

During the final walkthrough, she personally called the sellers attorney and demanded receipts for work that was supposed to be done. She found things that weren't done properly based on the receipts. Should I have done that? Probably, but I'm a first time buyer so I didn't really know what to look for and she didn't have to go above and beyond like that.

Could I have gone with a Redfin agent or no buyer's broker? Probably, but the therapist bills and bar tabs would have probably been greater than her commission. I really don't think this deal would have gotten done without my Buyer's agent, and I'd advise other first time homebuyers to do the same.

Note: this was done at ""no cost"" to me, sure she got a commission on the sale which lead to a higher price but to me its worth it to actually have a home

Faced with a dilemma that must be common. Two of my best tenant candidates (aside from this issue) have ""Staffordshire Terriers"" which I've learned is basically code for Pit Bull. 

My insurance company says it is a bad idea, but won't outright say they won't let me rent to people with this kind of dog. Also, I read horror story after horror story on the internet about how this can go bad.

Is there any way to sufficiently minimize/mitigate the risk of renting to someone with a pit-bull or other dog often categorized as a ""vicious breed""?

My thoughts:  
* Require the tenant to have renter's insurance that specifically covers dog bites.  
* Get a letter from the tenant that affirms that the dog has never injured or attacked anyone.  
* Write into the lease that the dog must be confined to the property or leashed at all times. Also, that we can revoke permissions for the dog at any time during the lease.

Is this enough? Anything else I should be doing (other than flat out turning them away)?


**Edit** 
I think it is worth mentioning that the rental property is in a rural area, and I am a little worried about turning away tenants with dogs because one of the main benefits of the property is a large fenced yard. If I was getting dozens of interested tenants I probably could be more choosy, but it sure seems like a lot of prospective tenants have dogs of notorious breeds.

There were some good suggestions, but nothing that had everything baked in. So I took the HOLD proforma and customized it to work better, and also to be able to toggle between FHA ""standard"" (or 203(b)) and the FHA 203K rehabilitation program.  If you click the dropdown box and switch from 203K to Standard it changes everything, for example repair costs get $5k bigger plus contingencies plus HUD consultant etc... and then baked into the financed amount, as opposed to standard where repair costs would come out of cash.


So have at it! I think if something like this were perfected and verified by people smarter than me, it would be awesome to see something like it on the sidebar.

The property I am sharing the template for is a real property that is under contract with someone else so I""m considering it off the market, but it's one that if you're curious, you can probably find on the MLS and dig into some of the assumptions I made etc. if you're geeking out.

Anyway, some of the things I'm unsure about are:

* how to handle closing costs? As of right now, it's baked into my total cash in, but other proformas don't have it anywhere. Thoughts? 
* what is good rule of thumb for maintenance reserves?
* are these estimates good for expenses, like utilities (water bill), homeowner and umbrella insurance etc good? 
* anything else you think could improve it? For example, some of the stuff on the ROI tab seems out of whack, like the ridiculous returns after only a few years.

So I'm trying to figure out if being a landlord is a realistic goal. With that I have a few questions.

1) Is 10-15 years a reasonable time frame to build up a portfolio of rental properties to live off? While say doing some consulting?

2) I get the impression that owning a apartments is where the real money is, would it be possible to build a portfolio of single family homes, then either leverage those and move into apartments? Assuming at some point I have enough experience.

3) as someone who hates working on houses, I'd obviously be using a management company. In fact I'd pretty much just want to sit back and collect checks. What are some downsides to being a landlord even when you have a property manager

   My wife and I listed our townhouse for rent last night with a local agent (who has shown to be very polite, well informed and easy to work with) and had a showing today at noon.  I work from home and took a long lunch, ran some errands to give the potential renters time to see the property.  I got back home at 12:55, the showing agent's truck was still in the driveway so I parked in guest parking and was playing around on my phone.  
    After about 5 minutes, I look up and see the showing agent standing and doing something in the driver's side of his vehicle.  He grabs a handful of trash, throws it on my lawn, and drives off.
    How would you respond to this?  We need the property rented in the next couple weeks, otherwise I would have lit the guy up in front of the potential renter.  I am a very private person, it's hard for me to open my house to strangers and this happens during the FIRST showing.  If the guy acts like this outside my house, who knows what's going on inside.  Is he kicking my cat? Rifling through my wife's delicates?

Obviously I feel horrible that I'm the reason we can't get pre-approval, especially given the fact that a) we can pay a 15-20% down payment, b) the mortgage would be easily less than 1/4 of our monthly income, and c) this is a huge investment opportunity.

Is this actually valid?,32,8,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/1fi2v6/received_a_letter_in_the_mail_today_threatening/,"Our direct upstairs neighbor has grandkids that she has over a few times a month.   Every time they visit they run around, screaming, and jumping around to the point that it shakes our walls.   We've been dealing with this since December of 2012 (about a month after we moved in).

I decided to try to contact them directly to resolve the issue since if my family was bothering the neighbors I would rather have them talk with me than involve management. 

I've contacted them on 3 separate occasions.   The first time was at 7 am (during our complex's quiet hours) and while I was speaking with her one of her grandkids kicked me.   

The last time we contacted them my wife went by herself since I'm a rather large and can be intimidating to some people. We thought my wife would be less threatening and maybe the upstairs neighbor would be more receptive to her.   When my wife went to speak with her, a guest answered the door and verbally threatened that he was going to ""come teach me a lesson"". He began screaming at my wife that the last time I'd gone up there, to ask her to address the children jumping off furniture, I made one of his kids cry. My wife apologized saying that my stature can be intimidating to a child, but the tenant said the little girl hadn't ever seen me (even though it was the child that had come out and kicked me.) She was told to talk to management since they weren't going to do a damn thing about the noise.

Since then we've written formal complaints to management on 3 separate occasions. We recently (almost a month after the incident with my wife) received a letter in the mail from the management company stating:

*Dear Tenant(s)*

I've checked the rental agreement twice and had my wife check it too. No where in the rental agreement, house rules, or any of the other paperwork we've signed or been given does it say that we need to contact management to address our complaints.   I'm happy to do so, and plan on contacting him as well as his supervisor at the management company next time we have an issue, but really part of the problem stems from the fact that they don't have any set office hours. We are then forced to leave him a letter in the mail slot and hope he eventually gets back to us/addresses the issue.

The exterminator will do that for free should if I bring in samples. If it is bed bugs, my lovely city makes it my responsibility, not the tenants just because it is a multi-unit (duplex). Exterminator said thermal treatment, which is guaranteed, for 30 days, is $2-$3k (without seeking the place). And that is only one side of the duplex.

An hour later we got a call back from the title company saying that the funding had gone through and it was all done and official. 

So we drive over to the house with our agent and the seller's moving truck was outside. We go inside and their mattresses and some other small stuff are still there as well as their dog in the backyard. It basically looked the same as it did last night during the final walk through (that the sellers were present for). They are moving out of state and not leaving until tomorrow as their son is taking his finals tomorrow. So we figured they would be staying in a hotel after close since we own the house obviously. 

Anyway, our agent was pissed, called their agent who was told that they would be gone, and their agent told our agent that they would be out today. So now we are bummed with the day off, sitting in our apartment and not in our new house. Honestly, I am willing to bet that they are going to stay the night there again as they have a dog and am pretty irked that this wasn't planned ahead of time with us. 

So r/realestate, has anyone ever had a similar situation? We kind of just want to go to the house and start painting even with their crap still there but are too socially awkward :-/

Tl;dr closed on house, sellers are still at house without an agreement/contract to rent back from us. 

**edit** agents got ahold of the sellers a few hours ago and they are leaving tonight. For some reason they thought they could stay until Friday which no one can figure out why they thought that lol. 

**Update#2** Sellers were gone by 10pm last night (12 hr after closing). Our realtor has been a saint through this whole process for us first-timers. She had someone change the locks already and as the sellers left some trash on the property she is having someone come and pick it up, as well as paying for a cleaning company to clean if the sellers don't follow through with their intention to have cleaners come today (was never in contract, just a nice thing they were doing for us).

I have seen offers that go 20-30k above listing price and offer cash to make up the difference between appraised amount and offered amount. Someone like me who doesn't have enough cash is pushed out of the way with these aggressive offers. 

I thought I was safe since I had atleast 20% saved up to put down, but nope I have recently revised my loan to allow me to put down as low as 5% so I can make a competitive offer. 

Last house I saw was listed at 210k, i offered 225, with 10k cash above appraised amount, as advised by my realtor. They got 40 offers on the house, with 10 being above 250, and the selling party counter offered by setting the minimum bid at 250.

I chose to do this for non-structural, non-safety items.  Those, I agreed to fix without a budget.

I did this selling my house in Huntington Beach a few years back to a sweet-but-tough elderly, Vietnamese woman.  I mention her race because those who know how hard Vietnamese work and how hard they bargain may appreciate this more.

I told her:  ""I will repair anything that's structural or safety related, no questions asked.  After that, if it's optional or cosmetic, I will give you a $1,000 budget.  If I can do it myself, then you only pay for the materials.  If I can't, then it would include labor.  Anything you want.  Up to $1,000.  What you don't use, I will give you at the close of escrow.""

Her inspector did a good job, his report had almost a hundred out-points.

So, I fixed the yard drainage... structural.  I converted an extension cord to a proper circuit.  I clamped down a few junction boxes.  A few other things... all safety related.

Then came the ticky-tacky cosmetic or optional bullshit. 

""What about GFCI outlets in the bathrooms?""  
""I can do that for about $10 an outlet""
""No, that's okay.""

""The inspection says the flashing at the base of the house is rusting.""
""Sure, about $25 for paint.""
""No.""

""Can you resurface the hardwood floors?""
""I can give you $1,000 toward it, but that would be the whole optional item budget, and I think it's more like $3,000.""
""The floors are fine.""

His number one defense was that he didn't have money and didn't owe me since he wasn't living at the house anymore.  I thought this was going to be a pretty cut and dry case for me.  It wasn't.  The judge proceeded to tell me that the guy didn't owe me money for the time he wasn't living there.  I provided the originally signed lease to him assuming that that is legally and contractually binding.  Apparently because it was one signed between two college kids, it didn't mean anything.  I'm curious how the hell that is even true?  I was the first case of the day and the judge was literally pushing us out the door to get to the next case.  I had evidence that he did in fact have money and was spending it on drinks, vacation, flying lessons, and 2 motorcycles.  Judge didn't even want to look at the stuff.  He even said ""if this was an apartment or something bigger, it would be a different story.""  I am seriously confused as to how in the hell that even matters.  With the way the judge said it, that means ANY contract that a college student signs doesn't get held up in court?  Car payments, student loans, apartment leases?  I have 5 days to appeal.  

2 questions, do you think I should?  I'm pissed off enough to do it but don't know if it's rational.  Also, would it be the same judge again or a different one?  If it's the same, there is no sense, the guy wasn't even paying attention when I was talking and not to be racist, but he couldn't even speak clear English.  If it's any matter, I'm in Texas.  I realize it may be hard to get any money, but for me, it's more about principle and if his credit gets hit because he doesn't pay, that's fine with me.  The fact that the kid is still out there partying and crap just ticks me off to no end.

The FHA says that the 36 month waiting period can be waived for extenuating circumstances and, while the people I talked to obviously wouldn't say anything that would amount to ruling on my situation specifically, they said I had a fair shot at it if a lender would manually underwrite me. However, every FHA lender I've gotten in contact with has a strict no-manual-underwriting policy in effect at this time, so they're not willing to even try.

Directly from the FHA:

&gt; Lenders may make exceptions for borrowers in default at the time of short sale if
• The default was due to circumstances beyond the borrower’s control (such as death of a primary wage earner, long term uninsured illness, etc.); and
• The credit report reflects satisfactory credit prior to the circumstances (beyond the borrower’s control) that caused the default.

I live in Texas and last year I wound up short-selling because our own realtor screwed us over; he submitted an offer to us, listing himself as the buyer, buyer's agent, and buyer's broker, for more than 30% off of our asking price. We were going through a divorce and we were fast approaching the last payment I would be able to make (the ex-wife moved out and refused to make payments). He told us, in writing via email, that ""we shouldn't worry about the contract price"" because he had no intention of buying this propery, it was just a ruse to put off any action by the bank and find out the lowest amount the bank would accept for the property. When I objected to this, he tried to tell me that he'd only seek to enforce the contract if the bank came back with a reasonable counter (""Uh, I thought you didn't want to buy this property?"").

At this point, we'd felt like we could sell the house straight up without having to short sell, and thought that's what we were doing. Our realtor squandered what time we had to get it sold on this gambit and pushed us passed a missed payment. Before I had a chance to fire him for this shenanigans, he produced a legitimate buyer -- but (a) we'd missed a payment and were about to miss another, and (b) he was about 10k below what we owed.

We accepted the contract. Then, shit got real; our realtor began asking us to file incomplete paperwork with the bank, intentionally leaving off my (much higher) income on worksheets, and such. I objected to this as well, so he terminated the buyer's contract and his representation of us _without any discussion._ Literally, the exchange went like this:

Him: We're only submitting your wife's income statements to the bank and hoping that they'll just assume it's a complete file.
Me: Uh, that's not kosher.
Him: I'm terminating our representation of you.

So, we thought initially that the buyer he produced wasn't legit, but we got a new realtor, recontacted the buyer, and managed to close the deal, only barely Short (by about 10k), and in default because of all these shenanigans.

I imagine I should have filed a Real Estate Board complaint against realtor #1, but I didn't want to muddy up my divorce proceedings any further.

2) The landlord transfers a written lease, security deposit, and background check on the current tenant at closing.

In my state, for month-to-month rentals, the time requirement to give notice to leave is 7 days. 

**UPDATE**: The tenant agreed to sign a lease with me contingent upon closing. He'll leave the security deposit with the listing agent in escrow until closing; then it will be transferred to me.

My lender, Discover Home Loans, sent me an email asking me to ""share my experience"" on Facebook/Twitter, etc.  

Sure - here it goes.

If you are looking to refi or buy a new home **AVOID THESE FUCKERS LIKE THE PLAGUE**.

We had been looking for a home for over two years.  During that time I spoke with a number of different lenders from Quicken all the way down to some mom &amp; pop lenders.  Somewhere along the way I spoke to Discover and was told about a program that they had where I could avoid having to pay any PMI (private mortgage insurance) which was quite appealing since removing PMI put us into a price range where we could actually afford something (we live in Southern California).

I recall asking the mortgage banker if this was something that was unique to DHL and was assured that it was.

THAT was my mistake - believing them.  Total bullshit, there are plenty of lenders that can offer you to pay your PMI upfront and chances are you can find a much better rate then the one I got.  But, again, that was my fault for listening and believing.

So - when we FINALLY got an offer accepted, I turned right away to DHL to get my loan process started.

At first, everything was going great.  The process was easy and smooth and everyone there was quite helpful.  That changed dramatically as we got further along in the process.

We reached a point where we needed to remove our loan contingency and in order to do that we needed a final approval letter from Discover.  I will spare you all the details but what I was told was going to take a day or two actually ended up taking a week or two and we nearly lost the deal because the seller was threatening to pull out since we would not remove the contingencies because Discover kept giving us conditional approval letters with a list of conditions that we satisfied with their underwritting WEEKS prior.

The worst part about it was how our Mortgage Banker (our primary contact) would not call me back for days at a time despite my repeated calls and emails.  On top of that - whenever I would call and try and get any manager on the line they would never answer their phones nor would they ever call me back.

The worst part came when they sent me a revised Good Faith Estimate that suddenly had my closing costs $8,000 higher then what they had provided me the month before.  The reason for this turned out to be that they were including some of the sellers costs in my estimate but the day I received that I tore my banker a new one over the phone and instead of explaining to me that those costs where not mine, he kept saying ""well, it's expensive in California""  When I demanded to speak to his manager - he gave me her number and told me to call her.

Seriously?

I could go on and tell you about how his manager later said that I was trying to extort them but I will spare the details.

**Home Purchasing Process: Best Practices**

Getting fiscally ready


     1. Should you buy or rent (Buy/Rent Calculator)

* http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/business/buy-rent-calculator.html

     2. If you still want to buy, research homes, and set the max amount you’re willing to spend

     3. Save for a 20% down payment

* If this is your first home consider putting money (up to $10,000) into a Roth IRA (Must be older than 5 tax years to withdraw)

* More about IRA's here. http://www.fool.com/money/allaboutiras/allaboutiras12.htm


     4. Check your credit score annually and submit corrections

     5. Visit a credit union or bank and get prequalified

     6. Ensure that monthly payments are under 30% of your monthly income 

     7. Ensure you have enough to cover closing costs


The search begins


     1. Check FHA for government lending programs

* www.fha.gov

     2. Find a mortgage broker to get the best rate on a mortgage

     3. Find a Realtor

* At some point your Realtor will have you sign an agreement saying you won't buy a house with another Realtor within some amount of time (90 days seems common)

     4. Find a few good options


Research


     1. Look up a crime and sexual offender map (e.g., https://www.crimereports.com/ - not all PDs use this)

     2. Talking to the neighbors

     3. Call utility companies to get the last year's average, high, and low bills (Not very helpful if it wasn't occupied!)

     4. Review the seller's disclosure statement (This is a form that a seller must give a buyer, which details all physical problems and defects that the seller is aware of)


Buying a house

     1. Make an offer pending home inspection

* Ask your Realtor to look for comparables (similar houses that have sold recently) before making an offer

* You can ask for closing costs, and for the seller to pay for 1 year of a home warranty

* You can also ask for inclusions (e.g., appliances, window coverings, any repairs needed found during home inspection)

* Note: You need to provide earnest money (typically ~1% of offer) when making an offer. You could lose this if you back out for a reason other than those allowed in the contract

     2. Seller presents counter offer

     3. If you accept, find home inspector

* http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/program_offices/housing/sfh/insp/inspfaq

     4. Consider other inspections (Radon, meth, mold, asbestos, termites, lead) Your inspector may notice some of these things, but a specialist will know more

     5. Subtract expenses/repairs from your original offer

     6. Create a purchasing agreement and present it to the seller

     7. Do a final walkthrough (Ensure the property is in the condition you agreed to buy)

* http://homebuying.about.com/od/homeshopping/qt/Walkthrough.htm

     8. Settlement


Yay you have a home!

     1. Get homeowner's insurance

* Consider flood and earthquake insurance

     2. Change locks after moving in

During the meeting I was told that *some* options are past the *November 2012* ""cut-off date"" and that to even ask about those upgrades, it will cost me $100 *for each upgrade*. For example, I can pick any fridge from the list of 6 they have available. No extra charges. But the rest of the kitchen appliances to match the fridge are past the cut-off date. Wtf?

1325695838.0,22,self.RealEstate,o2nkq,So you're thinking about becoming a Realtor?,22,0,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/o2nkq/so_youre_thinking_about_becoming_a_realtor/,"I usually post this when new folks in the biz come looking for advice. Here you go!

**Lead with revenue.** By this, I mean don't go taking out loans in order to pay for your start-up costs and expenses, or to pay for advertising materials (pens or other handouts, print ads, etc.). Don't go finance a new car so you look sharp. ONLY spend the money you have. I've been in real estate for a while, and all of the agents I've spoken to who started their career by taking out a loan or charging everything on a credit card said they later regretted it. This is mostly because you will end up having to make payments on all of this, and if you are having a slow month and can't make your payments, that's really bad. It's bad for your credit, but it's also bad for your business. You never want to be known as the guy who borrowed money he can't pay back.
If you want a new car, sell some houses, and then buy the car.

Let's see, what else... OH. **Reserves.** Make sure you have at LEAST six months of expenses set aside. Depending on the market you are in, it can take that long before you sell your first house. It may take less time, or may take longer. I did not have six months of expenses set aside when I started, and I really regretted it.

**Contact management.** Use some sort of contact management software. I know some companies have one they provide. USE IT RELIGIOUSLY. You will see more clients fall to the wayside and go buy or sell with someone else because you lost contact with them.

**Lead Generate.** You should be lead generating every single day. What’s more important than going on appointments to take listings? Lead generating. The reason is that without lead generating, you won’t have any listings. I lead generate for **three hours** every day. My goal is to make at least 20 contacts every day. If I’m on the phone calling people, 20 contacts means talking to 20 people who are decision makers. Leaving a voicemail or talking to a child or other person who is not a decision-maker does not count as a contact. If I get one of those, I keep going. If you make your contacts every day, you won’t fail in the business. 

**Set Your Goals.* Have them on paper. Post them where you and your family can see them. My goals are posted in my office, my manager has a copy, my wife and my accountability and role-play partners all have a copy. *When you set your goals and make them visible to yourself and others, you will achieve them.*

**Be Accountable.** Probably 99% of Realtors are “independent contractors”, so there’s nobody that we are required to report to. Unless, that is, you want to. And you do, TRUST ME. When you are accountable to someone else, you are more likely to achieve your goals. The person you are accountable to can be another Realtor, and they can also be accountable to you. I report to my accountability partner daily and tell him what I’ve achieved and what I haven’t, and if I’m not living up to my goals (or he isn’t living up to his), we grill one another about it and get to the root of the issue to see what obstacle is keeping us from being as productive as possible. 

**Schedule.** You need to have a schedule, and you need to follow it with strict discipline. If something is not on my schedule, it does not exist. I have time set aside each morning for blogging. That time is for blogging. It’s not for lead generating or administrative work. It’s not for appointments.  Have time for each item each day is called ‘time blocking.’ I will talk more about that in another post.

**Role Play.** I have a role play partner who is also a Realtor. He and I go through various scripts and scenarios, and we act as if he’s the client and I am the agent, then we swap off. We take ideas from one another while role playing and we then use those ideas when we’re out in the field. I also switch role play partners with regularity because you need to get new ideas from new people. 

**Have a Lawyer Contact.** Lawyers are expensive. They can also be very valuable to your business in helping you avoid litigation. Make contact with a lawyer, and be sure to send them business as much as you can, whether it is title work, notary work, etc. 

**Full time.** When you get into the business, get into it full time. This goes back to my earlier points about having some savings first. If you can't fully commit yourself to this when you first start, please, do us a favor, and don't do it at all. The agents who tend to get into trouble the most, and the ones who give other Realtors a bad name tend to be the part timers who have another job as their main source of income. This is because they never fully learn all the ropes and how to handle the business and they can be really hard to get a hold of when it comes time to doing a contract. Also, if you jump into it fully committed, you will do yourself a tremendous favor, because your business will prosper as well.

**Talk to people.** Tell everyone you know that you are in real estate. Don't be afraid to ask for business, either. You have to be the type of person who is not afraid to approach the FSBOs, or talk to people in the grocery line, or say, ""Hi, I'm sorry, I just overheard you talking about real estate. My name is Slidellian, it's nice to meet you! I'm a Realtor, were you thinking about looking for some property?"" or something along those lines. True story: I was getting a haircut a couple of years ago, and the lady cutting my hair was talking to the next person in line. The customer was saying that her son was looking for some land. (She had no idea I was an agent.) I said, ""Is he working with an agent? (no.) Great, my name is Slidellian, would you mind giving him my card, and I would love to help him find something?"" She took my card, and he called me the next morning. We looked at two properties, and 30 days later, we closed on a $230,000 piece of acreage. You really have to be willing to ask for business.

**Know Thy Neighborhood.** Get to know the inventory you have in your area. When you first start out, you should be previewing 5-10 homes each day. You can do this with vacant homes if you like since no one will be living there, or you can see the occupied ones during the day if the owner isn't home. Don't inconvenience people, but make sure you go see the houses. The whole idea is two-fold: One, you get to see the inventory, and two, you start seeing what kind of house different amounts of money buy in different areas.

**Read** Gary Keller is the Chairman of Keller Williams Realty, and wrote a book titled, ""The Millionaire Real Estate Agent."" Yes, it's written by a KW guy, but I know lots of agents at other companies who have read this book. It talks about building your business from the ground up, and how to be successful while doing it. In all honesty, it doesn't matter if you're starting up donut shop, or a real estate business, this is a great book. If you are really serious about this business, and promise to read it, let me know and I will mail you a copy.

*Testimonials* Right after you close a deal, ask your clients if they would mind writing a short testimonial for you based on their experience with you. Most times, people would be happy to do this.

**Be Fair To Yourself.** You won't work with sellers and take a listing without using a listing agreement. I highly recommend that you don't work with buyers without using a buyer-agency agreement. I use one with every buyer I work with. If they won't sign it, we do not work together. I've only had two people decline to sign it, and immediately after they declined, they admitted that they had been working with other agents already, despite earlier telling me they had not. Also, if you ever go to arbitration with another agent who claims that you stole their client, chances are good that the people who sit on the board will ask you if you had you Agency Disclosure signed, and also if you had any type of Buyer-Agency agreement. The other agent may not have had the buyer sign either one, so when you show up and can produce both, your chance of keeping the commission that is in dispute is dramatically higher.

**Mindset.** Your mindset might be the single most important part of your *life.* It determines your successes and failures, it determines your future, and it’s likely responsible for your past. If you have a mindset that this is a terrible market, and nobody is selling or buying, and it’s impossible to make a living in this business, you’re right. If you think that people don’t want to be bothered by talking to Realtors, you’re right, *they don’t want to be bothered by a Realtor with a sucky mindset.* I’m not saying you should be unrealistic. I’m saying you have to have the highest opinions of yourself, and you have to have a positive outlook on everything you do. 

I hope all of this helps! If you have other questions, please let me know.

Be well,
Slidellian

1368193558.0,21,self.RealEstate,1e2gdi,"Advice for my parents, who have been trying to sell their ridiculously oversized Swedish manor for about 5 years",27,6,33,http://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/1e2gdi/advice_for_my_parents_who_have_been_trying_to/,"I'm not sure this subreddit is the best place to get this kind of advice, but I couldn't find anything that seemed more suitable.

I've been hearing about my parents' struggle to sell their house for years and I really want to do what I can to help. They made the mistake of buying a herrgård (it's basically a Swedish manor house, and there's a second house on the same property that's a bit smaller, originally used as servant quarters) with some friends when they moved to Sweden. Long story short, they ended up owning two large houses in the middle of nowhere in Sweden (Värmland, good holiday location, but very isolated). Financially, it's a massive burden for them. They're not particularly well off and two large houses that are that old cost a lot to maintain. So far, they've split the smaller house into two flats and are renting one out and living in the other, meaning they can shut down the larger house during winter to save on heating costs. That house, they've been running as a self-catering guest house during the summer, but they really can't charge enough to cover maintenance. I know they've also been trying to split the property in two so that they can focus on selling the larger house, but they've had some issues with that (not sure on the details, I know there was an issue of shared driveways at one point).

They've had maybe four interested buyers since they put the house on the market about five years ago, all of which have decided not to buy in the end. Personally, I think they need a very specific kind of person who would see two big old houses with 18 bedrooms and 4 kitchens between them, and think ""That's what I want.""

Two issues I think of straight away: Cultural issues and presentation. The cultural issues are that, apparently, Swedes think showing/photographing a lived-in home makes more sense than making a house look like a show room. As an example, when we first visited before my parents bought it, there were clothes lying on beds, the beds weren't made, there were toys everywhere and nobody seemed to think that was weird. Certainly in the UK, that's not normal. You make the room look like nobody lives there, in a way that makes people think they might want to. Basically, their Swedish estate agents have been a bit of a mixed blessing. They do things a certain way that may work if you're trying to sell to Swedes, but no Swedes have ever been interested in buying it. As for the presentation... Well, the previous owner was an ambassador. He had nice, expensive furniture and, despite the mess, that made the place look more like it's price. My parents just have normal furniture, the stuff they brought with them from England when they moved there 8-odd years ago. Not to say you go in and it's ugly or shabby, it's just not what most people probably think the inside of a manor house looks like.

Anyway, if there's any advice anyone has, or thoughts on what would make the property easier to sell, please pass them along. I know basically nothing about selling houses, and I'm sure Reddit has some ideas that my parents haven't even considered yet.

I'd link their website to make this post make more sense, but I don't want it to seem like I'm advertising, so let me know if it's ok to do that.

Edit: Thanks for the advice, guys. I haven't really answered the people who have said ""Lower the price"", because I don't have much of an answer for you. I will pass on what you've said, but it's not something I can influence particularly. Also, some people are saying it's overpriced, others are saying it's reasonably priced, some people are implying it's under priced, so although I think they should lower the price to encourage interest, I'm not really sure what's accurate.",,False,,t5_2qipl,1368442446.0,,,True,t3_1e2gdi,http://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/1e2gdi/advice_for_my_parents_who_have_been_trying_to/,

I also know that there have been laws that were tightened as a result of the recession. And what they do now is different from what they used to do?

What I want to know is:

1. Do they know the contract price of the house? Do they use that or the list price? (Legally or practically?)

2. Are the ""listing"" comps actually used or there just for information?

3. What is done when there are no comparable houses (either within the given time or alike enough properties)?

5. Do they actually care if there is hardwood floor vs carpet? Or if there are 10' tall vs 8' tall ceilings? I see fireplaces being accounted for, but none of the other things...?

I almost said no but the phrase ""lawful source of income"" suddenly ran through my mind and I had a vision of trying to explain to a judge why I was discriminating in violation of federal law. So I said yes, at which point she told me that she always paid the rent on time but sometimes she brought her work home with her. At this point I had to control myself from busting out laughing.

Luckily I never got an application from her so I never had to find a reason to reject her. I still don't know whether she was a hired actress from Fair Housing who was playing an offensive sterotype to gauge my reaction, or she was really living that life. 

I'm still not sure whether I'd rather have her or another tenant I inherited when I bought that same building. This one was very pleasant when sober, which was approximately 1 hour per day. The rest of the time she would knock on the other tenants' doors, sometimes completely naked, asking them to go and buy booze for her since she'd been banned from every liquor store in the area. Rumor had it that she would also regularly trade sexual favors with random strangers in return for drugs or liquor. The previous owners, apparently also being insane, had made her the building manager so she was responsible for collecting rent each month, when not in jail for addiction-related offenses.

In a funny way I'm grateful to this lady and the other bums in the building -- if they had been better tenants I wouldn't have been able to pick the place up for a good price, make some cosmetic improvements, raise the rents by 25% and get in the excellent tenants I have today!

Here is the analysis spreadsheet I use.,26,5,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/sa9af/considering_investing_in_apartments_here_is_the/,"I pretty much just discovered this sub and would like to share. I am not a big-time investor, but I'm not a noobie either. I've got about 60 units which I run, but haven't been a buyer for about two years. In the process of getting to 60 units, I evaluated a TON of deals using this spreadsheet and was very happy with it. I've used its numbers to put together investment packets and the like, and it's not hard to add additional functionality if need be.

[Here's a screenshot.](http://imgur.com/nqS3q)

It's mainly good for quickly evaluating value-add property. You first fill in the known information about the deal, estimate what you think it could do, then compare the current and future value to see if it's worth doing further analysis.

If it is, you move to the bottom half of the spreadsheet and fill in the loan info, necessary cash investment, more detailed cash flow and expense info, and the length of time you'll be rehabbing and holding the deal.

You can then evaluate the cash flow, new equity, and ROI on the right.

The spreadsheet is nothing fancy, but it gets the job done. I've commented where it seemed necessary to help you understand what the labels mean. If you have any questions or comments, I'm all ears.

We have been married for almost 9 years now (we are 27 and 28). The first 4 years of our marriage I was in college, so we rented an apartment during that time. After I finished and we moved home, her parents allowed us to live in their basement apartment for 4 more years while we paid off all of our debt. We didn't pay them a set rent amount, but instead we took over a number of their monthly bills to share costs. But, it was definitely much cheaper for us, and we are now debt free (no school loans, no credit card debt, and we own both of our cars outright)!

I didn't want to buy a house until we had gotten rid of our debt, and my wife was patient enough and good enough to help me accomplish this goal in record time.

I am currently only making 42.5k per year, and we have two young kids now, and she is a stay-at-home mom. Based on my income, we decided to look for houses in the 70-85k range, though we were really trying to stay in the lower end of that range to keep monthly costs down. We ended up finding an amazing house listed for 74,900, and we jumped on it! It has 3 bedrooms, 1 bath, and is 1350 square feet.

And, almost everything in this house is new. The roof is only 3 years old; the kitchen was remodeled in 2010 with all new tile, cabinets, appliances, counter-tops, etc... The bathroom was also remodeled in 2010 with new tile, shower, jet tub, and sink. The furnace, central AC unit, and hot-water heater are all new as of 2011. There is an above ground pool with new pool liner, and they just built a huge deck in 2011 that exits the house and surrounds the pool. There is also a 7 foot privacy fence that surrounds the back yard that was built new in 2010. The carpet is less than 5 years old, and is exactly the style we like. There is a wood playset for the kids. directly behind the house is a huge park with a lake to fish at, basketball and tennis courts, and another playground for the kids. It really is perfect for us, and it was in our price range!!

Then, when we had the appraisal done, the house only appraised for 67,000 (instead of the 74,900 it was listed for that we had originally offered). We were amazed that the sellers agreed to sell it to us for 67k as well as give us 1500 towards closing costs (we had originally asked for 3k, but once the appraisal came in lower, they asked if we could split that amount in half, and we were happy to)! We are very grateful to them for all of this!!!

Also, since both my wife and I have paid off two cars, school debt, a number of credits cards, etc... over the past 4 years without a single late payment, we both have over 770 credit scores. This allowed us to secure a 3.875% fixed interest rate for 30 years on the mortgage.

All this adds up to an amazing deal for us!!

I was just so excited that I had to post this to tell someone!

I have been lurking on this sub-reddit for a while getting lots of advice, and I definitely appreciate the expertise I found here!

By a vote of 87 to 26, the House voted in favor of a quicker foreclosure process. The bill is now onto Senate for review, but it continues to be one met with a significant amount of controversy. Most of the bill’s opponents take issue with the cases of fraudulent Florida foreclosures. It is believed by many that under this bill, homeowners will have very little recourse in the case of foreclosure errors other than the monetary compensation that will be offered under this bill, HB 87.
The other important issue at hand for members of the House is the plan on how to spend the $200 million portion of the National Mortgage Settlement that was granted to Florida. Some of the proposals include using a portion of the money to assist low income FL residents with dormitory fees under the Florida Prepaid Tuition program. Additional expenditure proposals include $16 million to court resources to reduce the foreclosure backlog, and $20 million to go to Habitat for Humanity.

What are everyone's thoughts on this law?

Let's say I have $60,000. I purchase a fixer upper in a nice neighborhood for $180,000, requiring I put down $36,000. Done. I put the other $24,000 into renovations. I bring in a Realtor (let's say the bank does) and they appraise the new place at $220,000. ($180,000 original purchase price, $24,000 reno's and a $16,000 increase). My current mortgage is $144,000 ($180,000-$36,000). 

I now have $220,000 - $144,000 of equity in the house. $76,000. Banks will allow you to borrow up to %80 of the equity in your home. That's $60,800. 

Lather, rinse, repeat. Lather, rinse, repeat.

Where is the flaw in my logic? Assuming a ~67% increase on home value on the $24,000 reno budget (increased by the reno cost plus $16,000 = ~67%) is likely one of the flaws. However, making the right decision... maybe it isn't.

Can you not just do this over and over and over again?

1) I can find listings online. My realtor just automates the MLS search and waits for me to contact him about any that I like. This can also be done online.

2) I can directly call the listing agents from the website. I have to wait for my realtor to call the listing agent. I also may have to coordinate with my realtor to be able to see the property. Seems like an unnecessary middle man when dealing with hot properties. 

3) I have a proper contact found on realtor websites or drafted by my lawyer to be able to put my bid in, a one time cost.

4) I have inspectors and lawyers during the review process. The realtor does nothing during this anyways.

5) During closing, all of the work is done by my lawyer and me, realtor is only there for support.

Again, I know this might make me sound like an ass, and perhaps it's bad luck that I have come across too many bad realtors, but with the advent of the internet, I don't see the use of realtors besides someone that has access to the MLS database. The only reason that I have kept mine thus far is that listing agents have informed me that they are getting the full commission from the seller regardless, so I won't be ""saving"" that extra percentage.


**edit:** Thanks for all of the replies everyone. I've come to the conclusion that realtors are only as good as their experience. Those realtors that are doing their due diligence, good for you, you've earned 100% of the money. Pulling statistics out of my ass, I would imagine that 75%+ of all realtors do not do enough of the work that is warranted with a client. Those of you that go the extra mile to perform, should and most likely will be rewarded with repeat clients. What I still stand by however is that the real estate industry is a monopoly. People like me cannot take the extra risk and time needed to battle the seller's agent alone and be rewarded monetarily for my effort. If I want to represent myself in court, I can. If I want to fix my own car, I can. If I want to self diagnose an injury, I can (medication is a different story but that has to do with drug abuse I think). My point is that the restrictive nature of MLS as well as the practice of seller's contract with the buyers has made it so that the consumer is not benefited.

The internet has brought many buyers and sellers of goods together, sometimes free, sometimes for a small price. Let's let the real estate market do the same, and leave the option to the buyer/seller to pay for their own realtor.

I apologize in advance if I'm writing this the wrong way or I seem oblivious to anything that should be obvious here. 

Anyway.. Like my title says, I'm 19 years old and I want to wet my feet in the Property Market/Industry. I've worked Construction for the past 5 years and my family owns a General Contracting/Construction company in the NYC area thats doing rather well off. That said, I'd be looking to jump into the Property Market in New York City (NYC). Seeing that I'm studying Business Management at College, I'd love to wet my feet in multiple revenue streams and I believe Property could be such for me. I was thinking of going along the lines of properties that we could fix up since I already have the experience there with the Construction Company but I wasn't really sure how to go along with it.

What I basically wanted to know was how much money would typically be needed to start something like this up and how I would go along doing so. Purchasing these properties would come out of a mix of both my own and my parents money at the time until I could buy my own properties outright. 

My parents currently own one 4 Unit Apartment that they bought when they also bought my home (right next door to each other), but they also don't know much about the market. I've been thinking of taking classes on Real Estate and Property but haven't really gotten the chance to check those out yet.

What is wrong with people here. Don't they know that when the inventory picks up, you will have a lot more choice? Why pay more and outbid others for something which is so-so.

1. Since it is not listed for sale, am i beholden to the listing agency for their 6% commission?  I say 6% because the buyer is not coming to me with a realtor he is working with, and you know they'll gobble that other 3% right up because its easy money.

2. Is the listing company/agency entitled to any compensation since the home was originally viewed by the potential buyer at an open house?  Be no official offer was made, nor did he leave any contact information with the realtor holding my open house

3. If they are tracking the local real estate transaction, how likely am i to end up in some sort of litigation if the final sale goes through in February, 5 months after the property was unlisted?

I will compensate my buddy/realtor for his previous effort in some other fashion, i'd just like to save myself as much money as possible so it can be available for a down-payment on a new property.

I'm in the process of getting pre-approved by two different sources (a big bank, and a direct lender).  Neither lender seems to be providing details of rates/points/fees upfront.  The advice I read on the internet is to ""shop around"" and choose a lender that gives you a good quote... but it seems that the parameters of the loan change daily.  What's the best way to go about this process?  Should I get pre-approved from several different sources and then choose a lender *after* we make an offer on a house that's accepted?  Does the lender have to be chosen before that point?

It's a sellers' market here, and everyone keeps saying you need to write a ""strong offer"" which, presumably, involves the backing of a good lender.  But if that's the case it seems like you have to choose a lender before making an offer.  So... which one is it? Get lots of info and choose early? or wait until after your offer is accepted to choose a lender?

Today was the home inspection, the house passed with flying colors. A standard stipulation in real estate contracts is a certain amount of money built-in that the seller is willing to pay to fix things up. My contract stipulates up to $1500 US. Total estimated cost of repairs? $500. The lender's appraisal valued the house at more than what I'll be paying, and it's termite free.

So, today I found myself carrying my nine-month-old son around the back yard of our soon-to-be home, and we shared a father-son moment that I'm certain he won't remember, but I certainly will. I shed a single tear of joy.

There are two large trees shading the struggling grass - patches of what is obviously an unfinished sod-laying job. It is definitely summer here in Oklahoma, but today is not at all stifling hot. In fact, it's an almost perfect 78°F.  

A small metal shed that saw the Reagan years sits in a corner. Its contents are hardly a mystery, because I had just tested the sliding metal doors to see if the structure was worthy of keeping. The entire yard can be measured in square footage and barely totals one-tenth of an acre. 

But it will be *my* one-tenth of an acre.

The house is the standard 3 bedrooms, two updated bathrooms, open plan living/dining/kitchen, Formica countertops, Linoleum and engineered wood flooring, etc. The house is a tract house, built in 1983. There are hundreds like it within rock-throwing distance.

But, it will be *my* tract house.

I shed a single tear of joy, that soon I will planting roots for my family, escaping the tyranny of the endless ""this is only temporary"" lifestyle of being a renter, and finally having a place to call ""home"".

I'm a new redditor, so I'm sorry for any mistakes!
Here's the story...
My BF and I have been shopping for a house for about 5 months. We want to settle down and have a family (I'm 32 and he's 29). There was this house that came available on the Fannie Mae Homepath program about 4 months ago and we checked it out, loved it, but before we could submit our offer it went under contract. Fast forward to 2 weeks ago and I get the daily update from Homepath and lo and behold the house is available again! My BF and I are excited and submit our offer though the Homepath website over a week ago with a higher offer than what was asked. 
Here's were it get's...odd.
So we wait to hear a response in the first few days and we check the website with our Realtor to see if the listing agent submitted our offer to Fannie Mae. Nope, our offer is just sitting there by itself and limbo. So our Realtor contacts the listing agent and asks what is going on. The listing agent says ""The bank is considering other offers"". This is odd because there isn't any other offers listed in the website besides ours. So my Bf has tried to contact Fannie Mae to perhaps get a hold of someone that we can send our offer to since the listing agent is refusing. All he gets is the standard call center answer of ""Someone will call you back"" which was 3 days ago.
Last night our Realtor informed us that he sent an email to the listing agent stating that he felt that this wasn't being handled ethically and he would report him to the board if our offer wasn't submitted.
The listing agent called back our Realtor and stated ""The bank is considering other offers and I'll report YOU to the board!"" Our Realtor asked about these ""other offers"" and the listing agent says ""None of your business!!"" and hangs up. About 30 minutes later our Realtor gets an email from the listing agent stating that ""the bank is accepting another offer and our offer has been REJECTED"". So we go to the website and as of today and our offer is still there, active and unsubmitted. 
We love this house and we are so upset because we have given it our best shot. We think that the listing agent is holding out on the property for an investor friend and that he trying to get it cheaper that what they are asking. We are offering MORE than asking. 
We need a contact in Fannie Mae besides the call center and the clock is ticking! This listing agent will not budge and we just want our offer looked at. The property in Hollywood, Florida

r/RealEstate Help us!! :'(

**UPDATE:** 
* Both of us called Fannie Mae today and more voice mails just like a few days ago.
* I called a Lawyer and he said that he could file a Lis Pendens but it would cost $3,000 (OUCH!). 
* The Florida DRE only takes complaints by snail mail.

I'm closing on my first home, and I have good credit but I only want to put down 5% so I can allocate the rest of my cash to other projects. I was a little surprised at the interest rate, which is 4.5%. Based on what I've read and seen, people seem to be paying a lot less. When I questioned the lender, he explained that I'm only putting 5% down, and most importantly, I will not be paying PMI. Most loans with less than 20% down require that I pay PMI, which would more than offset that difference in interest rate to say, 3.9% (just to choose a number). 

I'm in Florida, the sale price of the property is $300K, I'm financing $285K, and my credit score is over 750. 

thanks!

________________________________________________________

**EDIT (2/20 7:10PM EST):** I spoke with the broker, and here's the update. I have two options, 4.5% with no PMI, or 3.875% with PMI. PMI will be $140. 

The 3.875+PMI Scenario will cost me $40 more per month in the short term ($1444 vs $1480). However, the PMI has a ""PMI Payoff"" amount of $2,000. This is the amount I need to pay at the time of removing the PMI from the mortgage once my LTV is under 80%

Real estate prices are rising, particularly in my neighborhood. I'm confident that I'll be under 80% LTV within 5 - 10 years. If it takes a full 10 years (very conservative scenario), the 4.5% with no PMI scenario will cost me $18K more over the full life of the loan. However, over the course of the next 10 years, I will have paid an extra $4800, and as the saying goes, a dollar today is worth more than a dollar tomorrow. Not to mention, there's the added ""hassle"" of dealing with PMI. 

So the question is now this, which scenario makes more sense? 3.875+PMI which will save me $18K over 30 years (but cost me $4800 over the next 10 years), or 4.5+NO PMI, which is simpler, and saves me money in the shorter term. Mind you, it's unlikely that I keep this house longer than 10 years, and the area I live in is appreciating quickly.

I was never informed of this. My fathe has sold the house; they are closing the deal now. He has asked for me to sign something today in front of the notary to allow the sale, as my name is on the title.


Does that make me part-owner? Should I be concerned about my share of the cost of sale? I'm close with my father (slash employer), but as a 26-year-old looking to buy his first property, even a fraction of this sale would be a great down payment for my first home...


As there is no written agreement that I am aware of, dictating shares, and there is no mortgage, how much of the property am I entitled to leglly?

I work a full time job and manage the property myself and all has been well. I've had a few people move in and out and I've raised the rents in those cases modestly. I've not raised the rents on people that have been there for 3-4 years and no one has been there longer than 4 years. The building is in great condition and there are zero problems or improvements that are needed. The building looks fantastic. There are no vacancies. After all the bills are paid including a put-away fund for the yearly taxes I clear approximately $3,000 a month.

All seems well-except:

I have no idea what I am doing. I believe the purchase and loan were done as well as they could be but in terms of managing rent rates I really am quite inept. On filling a vacancy where I didn't raise the rent I got a lot of calls and subsequently raised the rent on the next one. There is no rhyme or reason-it was just because of popularity. I've attended several landlord classes but they all deal with tenant problems and nothing really to do with the business of running rental property.

Any advice or resources on how to best manage the business of rental property?

Today is my cakeday, but that's just karma, I guess.
My family and I have been trying to get a decent affordable place to buy a house for about two years now.
We live in Berlin, Germany, in a nice 180sqm 5 room apartment near Kurfürstendamm, where I work. 

Prices have been skyrocketing. The apartment we rent might cost up to 800k, should it go to sale - and that's a number we cannot quite scrape together.

So a house, then.
We found a 1300sqm patch in the middle of Heiligensee (a very nice area). We will be paying 240k and then share it with another family.

Right after we acquire the estate, we will beginn planning a ~190sqm house (two stories), with 6 rooms (4 bedrooms, 1 guest room, 1 living room). 

My inlaws live four houses down the next road, which is great for our three children. School is around the corner. 

I'm just so happy now, had to share.

    ===================

My lot is somewhat large for the area. A few lots over from mine has the same area carved up into three different lots vertically between the water and the road in a manner very similar to what I'm proposing here, each owned by different people IIRC.

There are also several rental properties in the area (some further away from the water than others), so as far as I can tell this sort of thing is not unusual for the neighborhood.

Also we are not in a huge rush to rent out the new house or houses immediately or turn the project into an income-producing property. My wife and I come from large families and are leaning more towards using this project to build one or two guest houses for friends and family for the time being, with an eye towards renting them some time later down the road.

Based on those facts, here are my questions:

- Will I have to formally divide my property into two or three separate lots in order to build new house(s), or can I keep it one big lot?

- What sorts of approvals will I need to get from the town and county to approve my new construction?

- How much should I expect property taxes to go up upon completion of the project? $Current + ($Current / 2) or something? Less? More?

- Likewise, how would this affect my homeowners' insurance?

- Aside from increases in property taxes, insurance, the new routine maintenance responsibilities, and the one-time costs of construction, are there any other new costs to consider?

- How can I legally share my driveway with the tenants?

We purchased for roughly 500k, the appraisal came out to match our purchase price. With maintenance fees this would be about 3k / month outlay. 

Our income is 300k, we were approved for up to 1M by our lender but wanted to be comfortable in our payments so went considerably below that for our purchase.

Our debt is 10k of student loan debt.

We put 25% down, the coop only requires 20%. Beyond that we had about 65k liquid and 150k in retirement accounts.

Is it a worthwhile investment?,20,5,49,http://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/16m2mg/can_you_actually_purchase_property_or_houses_for/,"Right now, I don't have a lot of expenses, so most of my money (apart from necessities), goes into savings. I just graduated college, and while I have a job, its quite likely I won't ever make more than $40,000, and even if I do make that much it won't be for quite some time -- I'll probably be making $15-20k/year for the next five years at least. I have good credit, and I'm not in debt... I only rent, and I don't really want to own a house or property apart from the possibility that it is a good investment.

That said, I can't really afford to invest more than the above amount, and if I were to, it would be an ""all in"" sort of investment, which makes me doubly leery. In short, is it better to just keep stashing everything into savings and have the bonus of it being liquid, or is it possible to make a good investment for so cheap?

Apologies for the potential ignorance expressed in my post... I really know nothing about real estate.

Edit: I didn't say I don't plan on my income going up over time, but in the next five or so years, because I'll be in graduate school, I can't bet on a significant increase in income. Graduate school will also be my full-time ""job"", so to speak.

I also should have been more specific, but I have no plans to live in a home I've purchased for such a low amount -- I'm aware that it would be barely habitable, I'm just curious about it from an investment point of view. I probably won't live anywhere near the property I'm purchasing. 

As for people suggesting I do such and such so I can get a certain job to improve my income, I appreciate it, but I'm not really interested in making more money in a job that doesn't feel right for me, or I can't stand. For example, I'm working a job now where I only make $10/hour rather than a job I could of had making $15/hour because I find the former more valuable, (I get to set my own schedule, work from wherever I want, etc). Now, I live in an area of the country that is very cheap to live, but when I do move, my expenses will be covered by the school program I get into. I still have health insurance as I'm not older than 26 and I'm covered by my parents insurance, and at the point that I am no longer covered, I'll be able to get student health insurance, as terrible as it may be. I also have a car, and a place to live... I don't need much past that.

Edit 2: So you can do this, the ""catch"" is that you are either going to have to demo the house, which will cost you around $10,000, or take the time to do it yourself, which is obviously only worth it if you can sell the land for more than the demo costs.",,False,,t5_2qipl,1358377460.0,,,True,t3_16m2mg,http://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/16m2mg/can_you_actually_purchase_property_or_houses_for/,

I had heard about a new Fannie Mae loan that allowed one to refinance the home despite the lost equity.  I thought that meant I could refinance for the new value (it lost 47% of it's value in the last 6 years I've owned it) of the home, effectively writing down the principal to what it's worth.  Great!  I thought, now I can refinance into my name, and sell the house for what it's worth.  Not so.  Found out today that I can refinance and lower my monthly payment, but the principal remains about the same.  Especially since I am rolling the closing costs into the loan because I don't have much savings.  So from where I stand, I feel like I have 4 crappy options.  

1) Don't refinance and keep the ex on the loan; go into foreclosure 

2) Don't refinance and keep the ex on the loan; keep paying - either from renters or stay here (I want to move out of state, so this is the most depressing option).  

3) Refinance; go into foreclosure

4) Refinance; keep paying

My ex moved out of state after we broke up and ran up a ton of debt.  Seeing that I was probably already screwed on the mortgage, I started the process of refinancing to get his bad credit away from me.  Now, though, I'm kind of screwed either way and I feel like the ex should shoulder some of the debt we incurred together.  I also don't really mind the idea of taking a credit hit if I'm considering going into foreclosure anyway.  After this supreme crapfest, I don't ever want to buy a house again so I don't really care if that is the end result.  I don't really want to screw the ex, but I don't feel I am.  If anything, by running away from the mortgage, they were screwing me in the first place.  What would you guys recommend?

Basically, how much should this affect my offer price?

The seller did not inform us of either of these issues.

The police have been bringing in cadaver dogs and looking around as part of an investigation (I was wondering what those holes someone dug were for.)  Murder on property is typically -3% to price, so I read.  However, that doesn't account for the fact that the murder victim may still be, um, ""in residence.""  (Tangent: Are they considered a current tenant?  Har.)

If a property is the subject of an ongoing murder investigation, can it even be sold at all?

ed2: There is no requirement for informing a prospective buyer of murders in my state.

Second, if there are other people's structures that would be impinging on my property by 4 feet (not house, just parts of a large rundown shed),  how much could it cost in legal fees to sort that out?  The lot is only 50 feet wide so 4 feet is a significant part of the lot width.   I paid for the survey out of pocket as part of due diligence.

However, it's in an up and coming neighborhood and is priced probably 10% below market.  Should I attempt to go for a lower price, amend the contract to state ""Sale contingent on no ongoing murder investigations"", or just throw up my hands and walk?

Finally decided to go with one we found who was well recommended. 
 After finding the home we really wanted listed at $199,000. and having done a walk through, we asked our agent to start the negotiations and process. Wife and I were wanting to start negotiations at $185,000. (house had been on market 5 days)  Our agent said to let him do some checking on background before we made the offer. He came back and said the home was being sold because the couple were divorced, wife got possession of house and now that she was remarrying, she wanted to start fresh in a new house. He also found out she had $90,000. equity in the home and strongly suggested we go in with an initial offer of $179,000 with seller paying closing costs &amp; inspections. We told our agent you know the market and if you think we should start at $179,000 and negotiate from there, then go for it and you can kick it up to $185,000. without getting a go ahead from us first.
 This morning our agent called us and told us the seller accepted the initial offer at $179,000. ($21,000. below market appraisal, $20,000 below asking price and $6,000 lower than the price we would have offered were it not for our agent working on our behalf. 
 Our agent has arranged for us to be at the house during the home inspection, pest control inspection, radon testing and testing for mold. Our agent much to our surprise will also be there with us. Our agent knowing I have significant health issues wants to make sure all of the inspections are done with the highest professional standards.
 In this case, our agent is saving us significantly more money than what his fees will cost and spending more time to insure we get a house free of any health hazards or unexpected expenses.
 For us using a buyer's agent is looking like a win/win situation.
 So for anybody who is still trying to make up their mind about whether to retain a buyer's agent, in my opinion a good one is definitely worth it. ",,False,,t5_2qipl,False,,,True,t3_xqttz,http://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/xqttz/buyers_agent_well_worth_using/,

My husband and I are contract on an estate condition co-op apartment that has been vacant for years. It has a fantastic location, amazing pre-war details, very solid building--but of course it needs a major renovation to make it livable. 

Here's the issue: We want to solicit bids from contractors now so that we can start ASAP when we close, and these contractors need to be able to see the apartment in order to bid. The seller's agent is the only one who can let us in and he's giving us push back. The broker finally agreed to let us in with one contractor, but the trouble is that we have 3-4 contractors who we would like to bid...

Is asking to get in the apartment while in contract so unreasonable? Should we be bringing the broker gifts or something since he doesn't technically have to let us onto the property at this point? Any thoughts?

FWIW - We don't have our own agent (there's virtually no co-broking in our area--just seller's agents who make 3% commission only).

This is what I gleaned that I thought you guys would love and hate:


1. Before they choose a site, they decide how much it will bring to the neighborhood (prop values/job/income improvements), they put a value on it, and they have the local government/taxing board lower their taxes by a percentage (he mentioned 50%) based on the increased prop values/jobs/income.  So basically they get a portion of the betterment to society in the form of a property tax rebate.

2.  This store would setup a 'museum' in their store for educational purpose, and condo the building so that it was a separate entity.  Then they would 'donate' the museum to the municipality, and charge the municipality for upkeep.  They also pro-rated the costs on the parking spots so the 'museum' would pay its 'fair' portion.  

Those were the big two that I remember.......sorry...I thought number two was pretty sick....and this is how he did most of his stores....

The property was originally built in the mid-1920s as a large single family home, and was converted to a fiveplex in the 1940s. The property faces a large park, is in close proximity to downtown, and has easy access to transit and bike trails.

The units consist of four 2-bedroom units and one 1-bedroom unit. The property also has a 2-car garage and a few other off-street parking spots in the rear of the building. Recent improvements include a new roof in 2008, and a concrete driveway and front steps which were both done in the last few years as well. 

The seller is asking $375,000 for the property. The annual gross income totals $53,000 per year, expenses total $21,000 per year, and thus the net is $32,000 per year. The cap rate is 8.5%.

The expenses are on, what I believe to be, the high side because the utilities in the building are still set up as a SFH, thus the current property owner is paying for the electric for all five units. Based on average rents in the area, it doesn’t seem that the current owner has built the electric costs into the rent. 

If the electric was separated (not sure how feasible this is), or if rents were increased to cover the electric costs, I believe the overall financial outlook of the property would be better. If I charged $50.00 per unit for electric costs, this would bring the cap rate up to 9.3%

All of the tenants have been in the property long-term, with the oldest being there for the last 18 years, and newest for the last 2 years. 

I’ve managed a 23-unit property for the last two years, though the property owner dealt with the majority of the finances, so while I know how to deal with maintenance and tenant issues, I’m new to the financial aspects of property management. 

What things aren’t I considering? What should I look for when I view the property? Is what they’re asking for the property a fair price? 

Thanks so much!

It's a 30 day escrow flip house and we agreed to use the seller's recommended lender so the job could get done quickly (they also gave us credit towards closing). House listed at 324,900, we offered 335,300. Offer accepted at 335,500. Market has no inventory right now (Los Angeles area) so this is standard. Everything is multiple offers/bidding wars/cash offers. It's a nightmare.
The first appraisal came out low. Since the house is a flip (new everything including roof, plumbing, electrical), a second appraisal was needed. This appraisal came out spot on. The lender told us since they disclosed the first appraisal to us, there is some issue with getting a field review done so now they need to do a rebuttal. The thing is, we had to ask him to order the field review - he wasn't going to do it automatically. He just started telling us our new options for financing. Is that odd?
We are now shopping other lenders, even though it may cost us in per diem since we'll take longer than the intended escrow to fund the loan and we'll lose out $5k closing costs credit.
My questions - 1) Does this stuff with the lender sound shady? 2) Is it normal in this market to be paying more for a house than it appraises for? We do love the house and wouldn't have to put any work in on it, really.

Everything was going fine until Feb 12th 2013 rolled along, I received a text message from my land lord saying that we have been using way too much electricity, she said the bill for Dec 10 - Jan 10 was $670 and for Jan 11 - Feb 10 $400 so she said I would have to start paying 1/3 of the electric bill from now on (no separate meters) and that she would send me the next electric bill. I agreed even though no 30 day notice was given. I work from home and the other people are rarely there so it probably was my fault by using the space heater too much.

We (my wife and I) have been saving up for a house for a while now and have ~$18k saved up.  We are looking to get a $200-$250k house.  Income is not an issue and I prefer not to post it here.  Middle FICO score is around 660.  We are debt free except for a car loan.

A credit union I'm a member of is offering an FHA based first time home buyer program that pays for everything up front, except for the 3.5% downpayment.  This seems really appealing, except for the 1.25% mortgage insurance that you pay until you hit 78% LTV.  The credit union pays for the up front premium as well.  On the other hand is a conventional option with 5% down, but since I'd have to pay for closing costs, I don't think I'm there yet with my cash saved up.  The housing market is really hot here so I don't think the seller is going to help me out, either.

Is there an obvious answer between FHA or conventional for me?  I think the base interest rate on the FHA will be better since my credit isn't stellar, and I'd also be getting in on it before the rate increase in April as well as the permanent MIP in June for 30 year loans with lower down payments.  I know having 20% down is ideal, but with interest rates so low and our apartment lease ending in June, we'd hate to be renting for another year saving up more money and not in a house building some equity.

We're familiar with the day-to-day issues with managing an older property, such as tenant issues (noise-complaints, late rents, etc.), maintenance issues (largely plumbing issues in this building), and we handle almost all of the administrative tasks for the building (maintenace, coordinating with contractors, dealing with utilities, rent collection, etc.). 

We don't, however, know much about the financial aspects of multi-family properties. The building owner handles the property taxes, insurance (both building and boiler policies), etc., so we are not very familiar that portion of the business. 

We have, mostly, been enjoying the experience, and think there is great wealth potential in this business. We've been doing the ""grunt"" work at our current building for two years now, and we are ready to start seeing the finanical benefits of multi-family housing. 

A dream of ours would be to buy the building that we currently live in / manage. It is in a wonderful location, has a good group of tenants, and seems to have pretty good financial figures (again, not too familiar all of the nuances).

A few weeks ago I started considering buying a condo/loft/townhome/not ahouse due to the offer of a down payment gift from my parents and also considering the current state of housing market.   

I did my research, looked at what was available, seriously considered my options, got preapproved, found a highly rated buyer's agent, and visited 10 places.    


Last weekend my agent and I visited a place I really liked and one I thought was a serious contender. I wanted to have my parents come visit the following weekend and hear their thoughts/get their approval.  My agent was extremely adamant about moving fast and making an offer within the next three days. I told her I didn't feel comfortable without having my parents view--they were paying the down payment, after all. Yet she still insisted that I make an offer and my parents could visit during the Contingent-Due Diligence period.  I was hesitant.   

I talked to my parents and they researched the loft I was interested in and they hated it. I told my agent their thoughts, that they would probably prefer I get something more traditional, and that I wanted to hold off on any offers until I was confident about the decision to buy it.    

She followed up with a two page long email (srsly. two pages. single spaced. in Word) about how I should have told her earlier on that I wasn't the sole decider, that my parents would be involved, and that the only way we could work is if we all 4 met and came to an agreement. She was also very adamant about her opinion on traditional condos and went in length to explain why she's experienced and why buying a condo would be a bad investment.   


I was annoyed. I felt like I was being treated like a child when all I wanted was to think about it and consider my options. I told her I wanted to explore more and she sent ANOTHER two page long email about how she had already shown me everything on the market (we visited 10 places in 6 subdivisions) that was the best investment value for my price range (160K). She then went on to say we were stepping backwards and that I should have figured out what I wanted style and location I wanted before coming to her. And she is also adamant about not showing more than 15 homes because it gets ""unproductive"" after that.    


And honestly, after all of this. I don't want to buy anymore. I'd rather continue being independent, not taking money from my parents, and feeling pressured to buy what they like vs what I like. Plus, my agent has really pushed my buttons with her emails.   


I want to tell my agent that I am no longer interested in buying but I am actually *afraid* of how she'll react. Sure, maybe I should have been better at communicating but I also feel very pressured and uncomfortable working with her. I did sign a brokerage agreement with her and already paid her a retainer fee of $500 (yeah, ouch).

We're doing a 30-year fixed with 20% down.  Talking to the mortgage guy yesterday, though, there was a small snag.

I've been at my current job a bit over a year.  It pays well, I like it, and plan to stay there -- no issues actually covering the mortgage, as far as I'm concerned.  I'm in software, so pay &amp; employment outlook are fine long-term.

However, prior to this job, I took an 8-month hiatus after having worked at Big Corporation making good money for 6 years.  My team was reorganized into oblivion twice in 6 months, so myself and (literally) dozens of coworkers quit -- many of us are now at my current company.  I had plenty of money saved up at the time, so all bills were safely covered for that period.

Mortgage guy didn't sound happy about the employment gap, and it means my last two years of tax statements reflect only 6 months pay (2011) and 9 months pay (2012).  He wants me to write a letter explaining the time off.  I spent much of the period working on personal projects to refresh tech skills, but they didn't really make any money directly (aside from helping me get a better job at the end).

Question is, how do I put the best spin on this period in the letter?  I have paystubs, offer letters, and W-2s going back several years to prove that my ""funemployment"" period was a one-off break.  Do they need reassurance that I'm not a flake, do they care about the reason for leaving Big Corp, do they really only need documentation that I can afford this house...?

As I've never done this before, I requested all the documents before hand so I can read them and not waste everyone's time at the closing.

This legalese seems alarming, as it seems to state I can't prepay my mortgage:

&gt;I have the right to make payments of Principal at any time before they are due. A payment of Principal only is known as a ""Prepayment."" When I make a Prepayment, I will tell the Note Holder in writing that I am doing so. I may not designate a payment as a Prepayment if I have not made all the monthly payments due under the Note.

&gt;I may make a full Prepayment or partial Prepayments without paying a Prepayment charge. The Note Holder will use my Prepayments to reduce the amount of Principal that I owe under this Note. **However, the Note Holder may apply my Prepayment to the accrued and unpaid interest on the Prepayment amount, before applying my Prepayment to reduce the Principal amount of the Note.**

Worrisome text is bold.

Doesn't this mean they have the option to apply a pre-payment to the surprisingly massive amount of interest I'm being charged despite the low rate? If they have this option, of course wouldn't they exercise it?

If my Principle is $100K  and my Principle + Interest due after 30 years is, say, $200K, then it sounds like a Prepayment just takes a bite out of the $200K and doesn't reduce future interest.

Most if not all other houses have a second story.

The house was built in 1975 and as I mentioned, I'm already planning on renovating the existing level. I'm young, no family yet but that could change in 5 years. I'm planning to live in the house for 2-4 years so I probably will not have children there. Plans can change though, of course.

Tax foreclosure auction, need some insight",19,4,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/1epfll/update_whats_going_on_here_tax_foreclosure/,"[The Original Thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/1ecxmo/whats_going_on_here_tax_foreclosure_auction_need/)

Just thought I'd pop back in to give an update to what went down last week Thursday at my local tax sale. 

I showed up to the auction with a $20k cashiers check. When I got there, there was a LOT more people than I expected. The room maxed out  capacity and they stopped letting non bidding spectators in. The first property got auctioned off for around $7k so I thought I may have a chance for the two I was eyeing. The very next property went for $560k. It was a beach front property but still I realized I was out of my league. The two I were eyeing went for $77k each.

All in all, it was a great experience. I always like to think you grow the most when you put yourself out of your comfort zone and this was definitely way out of my comfort zone (internet business). Here are just some of the many things I learned when I was there for just those few hours.

1. Many of the people there probably had lines of credit. Once I realized that, I laughed at myself for bringing my puny $20k cashiers check. My partners and I don't have real estate we can leverage yet, so until we do I probably shouldn't waste my time at these things. Bringing cash from our bank account was like bringing a knife to a gun fight.

2. Contrary to what I thought when I got there, the tax sale doesn't wipe out any of the existing liens. I learned this by listening to the people around me talk as the ones who knew what they were doing quickly told the ones like me who didn't that if they bought so and so property they would have been stuck with tons of inherited debt. Evidently one of the parcels I was looking at had around $200k in liens, so I dodged a real bullet by not having enough money.

3. Because its As-Is, title may not always be clear. Evidently talking to the person sitting next to me, the property that went for $560k did NOT even have clear title, so it was going to be a fight for the person who came away with it to even get it into their name.

4. My friend called me later saying that he heard that I went to the tax sale. He told me he used to go all the time and buy property there, so now I have someone I can talk to locally and get all my questions answered. 


I'd just like to thank everybody here who took the time to answer my questions no matter how dumb they were. You guys are doing a real service.

1368142291.0,16,self.RealEstate,1e198e,Tenants moved out early...,20,4,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/1e198e/tenants_moved_out_early/,"Alright I'm looking for some advice. I'm in the military and own a home in California (and i live on the opposite side of the country) that I've been renting to the same tenants for a 3 year lease. They submitted a 60 day notice that they were moving out at the end of their lease on April 30th to my property management company. In the lease it states in bold letters ""Security deposit is not to be used in lieu as payment for last month's rent""

My PMC allowed them to do just this without telling me. They destroyed the carpet in the hallway, stairs, and master bedroom and the blinds are destroyed that were all brand new at time of move in 3 years ago. The walls have been beat up pretty good and the whole interior needs to be reprinted. According to the PMC the paint is normal wear and tear and has a life of 3 years. Carpet and blinds are 5 years so we can bill the tenants 2/5ths the cost to replace them. 

The lease also states if they terminate the agreement prior to completion of written agreement they will be responsible for ""any lost rent, rental commissions, advertising costs, and painting costs necessary to re-rent unit.""

The PMC is stating because it was around 30 days that they left early (last rent payment) that it's ok to use the security deposit for rent. This leaves me with no additional funds to go towards additional cleaning and repairs from their security deposit. They billed the tenants the amount for repairs and cleaning ($491 which would have came out of security deposit) but the tenants wrote a rebuttal claiming they cleaned the house well enough not to have to pay that amount.

My question after all of that is if I were to try and take them (previous tenants) to small claims court for the additional $491 would I also be in the right to add in the 1 month of missed rent and the entire paint cost even though they say the paint life is only 2 years?

Is it even worth the hassle of going through small claims court for the $491?

We live in a townhouse, so there is an association. Right now, the outside (like the grass) looks kind of crappy - due to winter just ending and all - is this a turn off? Will people understand that we have landscapers and they'll take care of it when it warms up?

I'm fairly depressed about the following post so please be easy on me. 


Im 34 years old and grew up in the Bronx, NYC in the 80's -2000's.. Despite having two working parents, we barely made ends meet.  Inner city thuggery and the culture against education made my upbringing very tough and served as the main source of motivation.   I made a promise to myself then that I would never raise a child in an area filled with crime and poverty. 


My parents could not help me financially, so I had to fend for myself..  Roughly  6 years ago I earned a salary of 30k and could barely make ends meet. I dropped out of college because I could not afford the commute.  My credit cards helped supplement income whenever I needed it which was a bad way to live. I kept studying and eventually tripled my yearly income. In the process, I went back to school and finished (12 years later). Credit cards helped finance 1 class at a time until I was able to do it. This resulted in 10k CC debt.  Fastforward to 2013 - I'm CC debt free. 


I live in Astoria NYC where the rent is $1450 for a crummy 1br.  It goes up $75 per year so in 3 years I’ll be paying $1750 for a crumby 1br. This is just unacceptable.  I’d like to move to a house, but am concerned that I’ll never be able to.  The thought of this just breaks my heart. My girlfriend (who does not live with me now) has no income, 1 child, and no education/job.  If we get serious it’s only an additional burden for me.


Looking at home values in NYC – my  old neighborhood in the Bronx has 2br-homes running 200-600k. My current neighborhood has homes running 700-1.2mil.  This means at minimum I have to save 40k-140k. Currently I can save about 10-15k/yr…making the feat seem impossible.   


Does anyone have words of advice, encouragement, reality? I honestly don’t know where to turn anymore.  I feel like giving up and moving back to the Bronx (which is much ""nicer"" now but still the gutter). The thought just makes me cringe.

1361896311.0,15,self.RealEstate,199kim,[NY Area] Buy something now or wait (for the sake of waiting?) - Debate with Fiancee,15,0,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/199kim/ny_area_buy_something_now_or_wait_for_the_sake_of/,"So my fiancee and I currently live in Manhattan (rent is ~$2300).  We're planning on getting married in the Summer/Fall of 2014.  Her parents are paying, so we have some money for a down payment (~10% on $300k budget).  We are 100% sure we want to buy something in the next few years.  Ideally, we want to move into a house in a few years.  So here's the conundrum we are debating:

__Option 1__:  I want to buy something NOW.  Rates and housing prices in the area are going up.  We'd get a nice apartment in a nice area (White Plains).  Walking distance to the train station, shops, etc.  When we're ready (say 5 years, max) - we'd either sell, or rent out the apartment.  With mortgage + approximate maintenance fees + cheaper everything else, we'd save money and have something at the end to show for it.

__Option 2__:  She wants to continue renting and wait until after the wedding when we have more money to put down for a down payment (and therefore a lower rate), and go directly into a house.  This eliminates 1) the middle step of the apartment and 2) the possibility of getting stuck in the apartment.  However, we'd end up losing a lot more money on rent and potentially the higher rates and housing costs.

I absolutely see the merits of her argument, but my biggest concern is that rates and housing prices will end up going up so much it will price us out of something we'd be able to afford now and we'd end up spending a lot more over the life of the mortgage when we don't have to.  Either that, or we can't find anything we like because they're out of our price range and we end up continuing to rent and lose more money.

Three are REO and are being sold together under one MLS #. The condos are currently rented, except the one owner.

There are two similar buildings on the same street at the condo, but are owned as apartments. What it sounds like is someone purchased this building 7 years ago, tried to make them into condos and it foreclosed as they never sold all the condos. It is a local REO. I have currently requested the condo docs and hopefully will have those shortly.

Here is what I am wanting to do and am seeking advice: I am wanting to buy the three units, and thus will have control of the association. Ideally, I would want to buy out the owner of the one unit. The owner purchased in 2007, and is most likely underwater. I would then dissolve the condo association and rent out the units.

Questions: I plan to purchase the three condos with one mortgage from a local bank. I currently have 3 mortgages and this would be a 4th, which puts me at the cap. Anyone have experience with putting more than one property/parcel on an investment loan (not commercial)?

Assuming I get the condos, I see two scenarios with the owned unit: they don't sell, in which case I have three condos, but all are cash flowing nicely. I continue to run them as rentals and manage the association separately and pay for 3/4 of the buildings costs.

Second scenario: They sell to me. It would have to be less than they paid, so they most likely have no incentive to sell, unless I can somehow do a seller financing type of strategy and take over their underwater mortgage. I would then want to dissolve the association (or would I as long as I own them all?). I would imagine I need an attorney to dissolve the association, but any comments or experience in this?

One of the things he mentioned was that they were uncomfortable with deposits less than 5% of the asking price. So our realtor advised us to adjust our contract to include this large deposit after the attorney review period and home inspection and send it over.

Does this sound fishy at all? What would be the reason the seller's would want such a large amount of money? Isn't it going to be held by our attorney and they wont have access to it anyway?

I don't want to get into too many details here but give a brief overview of my situation in the hopes that someone can give me some advice as I'm floundering a bit and I want to make sure I'm in the right before I argue or have to respond with legal action. 

Here's the timeline:

1.) I sign a lease on an apartment starting Feb 1st 2012 and ending on Jan 31st 2013

2.) I get a job out of state and alert my landlord I need to be out by Nov 12th, 2012 (Informed him via email on October 18th, 2012)

3.) Paid November rent and did not request my security deposit back as an act of good faith for cutting the lease early


At this point I showed the apartment to a number of people always referring them to contact my landlord if they were interested in leasing the apartment. I also showed the apartment to people that my landlord asked me to. 


4.) Moved out November 5th


This is where communication basically stops, didn't hear from him so I can only assume the place was rented or he was fine with my moving out.


5.) January 15th, 2013, Got an email from the landlord yesterday that he expects me to pay Dec / Jan rent


At this point I had my good friend swing by the house and knock on the door, the new residents explained they'd been there for a month. So I replied to the LL asking him what he was talking about since the place is obviously already rented (he can't double dip on rent) and he only replies saying the new lease doesn't start until feb 1st 2013. 


I think this guy is trying to pull a fast one on me thinking that because I'm out of state he can act like the place isn't rented and get 2 months of rent out of me despite the fact that someone is already in there. I can't imagine they are living there for free waiting for the lease to start on feb 1st. What can I say to the guy?

I currently own most of the units in a condo building and am looking to acquire the last couple for consolidation. One of them has been going through foreclosure and has been listed as a Fannie Mae Homepath REO. (I tried to acquire it before it reached this stage but was unsuccessful.)

I expect to be the only serious bidder because:

1. Condos are ice cold in this area

2. No buyer can obtain conventional financing because the majority of the units in the building are owned by me and used as rentals

3. I gave the condo association a right of first refusal, so it can match any third-party bids

Because of the above I believe I can get the unit for a good price. I picked up its identical sister units for $73k apiece and it is listed at $90k. Perhaps I am deluding myself but I feel that at some point FNMA will just sell it to me for a nominal sum ($10k or $20k) because they will not get any other serious offers.

My questions are:

1. Does anyone know the strategy that FNMA uses to determine what price they will accept? For example will they reduce their acceptance price by a certain percentage for every month that it goes unsold? This would help me to figure out the lowest price I can offer at any given time.

2. Is there some minimum price that FNMA will not go below? For example if they will never sell for less than some percentage of the original asking price then I will focus my energies on offering at that minimum instead of holding out for a nominal sum.

3. Is there some timing strategy I should use for making offers? For example would it be to my benefit or my detriment to make early low offers, or doesn't it matter?

Thanks for all your expertise!

I'm nearly thirty, tired of renting, and looking for a place to invest my time and money in. I found a fourplex for sale that I'm thinking about buying. It's in a low-income area populated by nothing but three- and four-plexes, and [mine would definitely *not* the nicest property in the area](http://i.imgur.com/CH28TQA.jpg). (Yes, the owner of that car still lives there.)

My thinking is, if I move into one of the units, that loss of potential rental income would make up for the fact that I'm no longer paying rent. The second unit would be paying my mortgage, one unit allowance for vacancy, and whatever is left would account for monthly maintenance, all the while I'm building equity.

The seller is asking for $153k, though the property probably needs a good bit of work. It will need a new roof, to be sure. The cap rate I calculated for the property is 9.3 (disclaimer: I know nothing about calculating cap rates). I've come up with an cap rate of 10.82 and 10.96 for two other similar properties that have just sold in the area. 

Firstly, should I even consider going through with this? My uncle is concerned the property is a black hole. It's been on the market for three years, though its my thought that this is just due to the poorer return on investment compared to the other properties in the area.

If I *do* go through with it, should I use the cap rates of the other properties to dictate how much I offer? If I use a cap rate of 10.90 on this property, that would make for an offer of $131k. Would I then lower the offer further to allow for required building improvements? 15k less for a new roof, etc. Or should I just demand the seller make this improvements as part of the contract? I feel like I would rather be in charge of the new roof, as he'll try and do it as cheaply as possible. Well, so would I, come to think of it. But at least I have discretion on just how cheap to be...

Any thoughts you may have to offer are appreciated. I'm very nervous about the whole thing, as this is a hell of a lot of responsibility for me to be jumping into feet first. Ultimately, I would like to start building a portfolio of rental properties, as I see this as potentially being a good career move for me. I could just say fuck it and buy a single-family house, but i feel like if I'm going to be investing my money, I'd like to do it in something that is generating income.

What are our options?,14,2,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/1axrlu/to_buy_vacant_lot_next_door_what_are_our_options/,"My wife and I recently bought a house last July. We have a 30 year mortgage with 3.5% fixed. The previous owner also owns a vacant lot adjacent to our property. It is the exact same size as our lot, 4,800 sq ft. (.110 Acres). According to the county, both lots are valued at $26,400. The tax on the vacant lot last year was just shy of $500.

We talked to the owner and he is willing to sell as there is relatively little use for the land for him now. Not sure if they could actually still build a house on there but he seemed very willing to work with us. 

Initially we looked at either taking out a personal loan from the bank or doing a land contract with the seller. If we did the land contract, we would have to pay a bit more in the long run. If we took out a personal loan and paid for the land up front, he would let it go for 20K. Is that a good deal? I know land doesn't really go down in value much often.

We're just not sure if we're possibly paying too much or if there is something else that we should consider before taking out a loan.

Why a $200 dollar deductible for ordinary repairs on appliance and plumbing?,17,1,33,http://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/1afdsh/first_time_house_renter_in_ny_state_why_a_200/,"Was reviewing the lease I was offered on a place in Westchester, and it had the following clause in the rider:

""Appliances and plumbing fixtures:		

Landlord has supplied Tenant with a refrigerator, dishwasher, stove, washing machine, dryer, and plumbing fixtures in good working condition. Landlord shall guarantee these for 30 (thirty) day from Tenant’s possession; thereafter Tenant shall be responsible for ordinary repairs to the Premise’s appliances, plumbing and heating system. Ordinary repairs shall be defined as those repairs costing less than $200.00 (Two Hundred Dollars) occurrence. Landlord shall be responsible for any additional cost thereafter, except for repairs or replacements caused by Tenant, Tenant’s guests or service people’s negligence or misuse, which shall be paid solely by the Tenant.
The foregoing charge shall be payable by Tenant irrespective of whether repairs are performed by Landlord or Tenant. If paid by Landlord, such charges shall be considered “added rent”. Tenant shall promptly notify Landlord or Landlord’s agent by phone if any repairs are necessary, and provide access to the Premises. ""

This sounds really fishy to me. This is not the first time I have rented a house, and what this clause seems to say to me is that there is essentially $200 deductible on repairs to the appliances, plumbing, and heating system. Since the house is 100 years old this would obviously cost me. It also seems like this is a way for the landlord to transfer some of the responsibility of owning the property, in this case what I would consider the cost of doing business, to the tenant. I also know that these repairs are tax deductible for the landlord. There are already clauses in the lease agreement (boilerplate stuff) that protect the landlord in cases where the tenant brakes something, the tenant fixes it - that part I completely understand. So why would they include this? Is this normal?

EDIT: This seems to be an issue of some contention. I understand that as a landlord of a house you want your tenant to be responsible, but there has to be a better way to incentivize the tenant to do so rather than create a set of circumstances that penalizes the tenant for going to go to the landlord to fix a problem when it is the landlords best interest to keep the property up (unless, of course, you are the type of landlord more interested in money than anything else).

TL;DR - Lease agreements can be written poorly, and a landlord should try to be as equitable as possible if they want good tenants.

However, I am setting up a corporation with a few partners.  Most of us are American, but my friend with some other Canadians are setting up a Canadian Hold Co to buy into the business. 
We are planning to keep the profits in the business to pay down the mortgage and buy other properties, instead of taking out the profits each year.  This way the business can grow quicker.
This is the message that he sent to me.
The more I'm digging into this the less convinced I am that an LLC is
the way to go. I think a regular corporation suits our needs better from a taxation standpoint.

While an LLC avoids double taxation, that's only an advantage if the members are actually taking money out of the business each year. An LLC is a pass-through structure, so members have to pay personal income tax on their portion of the LLCs earnings each year. The kick in the balls is that they have to pay that tax __even if they don't take the money out of the business___!! The second kick is that the members also have to pay a ""Self-Employment"" tax (stuff like Social security and Medicare) in addition to income tax.

While combined state and federal corp rates are slightly higher than personal (24.5% vs 20%), the self employment portion is an additional 13.3% on top of that 20%, and all that personal tax needs to be paid every year, whether you have the money in hand or not.

 Since we plan to leave profits in the business, it doesn't really make
 sense for us to pay 33.3% instead of 24.5% every year. We would have to pay personal taxes at the Dividend Tax rate (which is lower than regular personal at 15% I think) when we distribute funds out in the future, but I think there is a pretty strong argument to be made that paying
Dividend tax once on a future dividend while paying the corp rate the whole time is going to result in a lower overall tax burden than straight up personal from year 1. Never mind the personal cash flow implications of having to pay taxes each year on money you don't even have yet.

We don't really USE it as an office very much; it's more of a collection area for random junk, so when it's staged it won't be able to be used for that purpose anyways.

We have seen other homes that are closer, though only marginally, but I wanted to get others' input regarding commute time and its importance to them when buying a house.

Edit:  This probably should have been included initially, as it's valuable information:  my significant other is currently pursuing a terminal degree at a school that is approximately 80 minutes away from my workplace.  That said, our goal is to minimize our commutes (an even 40/40 minute split is ideal), but this drastically reduces the places we can look.  There is a band that we've identified which will put us in that general area, but many of the homes we've looked at really don't meet our needs - and definitely not our wants.  As a result, we've stretched that band a little to open up our options.  So what this all means is that a 40 minute commute is the minimum.

I've been a bit lazy about it, admittedly.

I just went to check up on the house a week and a half ago, because we've had a harsh winter and I wanted to make sure no pipes had burst.  Everything seemed in order, the heat was on, water worked.

I got a call from a neighbor of that house today.  Apparently, there has been a man living there, from their words, for the last month.  He parks his car (which they described) down the block and walks to the house and goes around back.  He usually comes very late at night (they said around midnight) and leaves pretty early in the morning.  He left a little later this morning and they decided to call me and ask.

They talked to him early in the morning and he said he lives there, gave some story about his girlfriend living in the house behind it.

I don't know what to do.  If I call the police, he won't be there.  I do have insurance on the house.  I find it strange that I saw no signs of someone living there when I checked up on it recently.  

I'm worried to check on the house on my own, and our local police have horrible response times, so it'd be difficult to coordinate meeting them.  Should I scope it out with a buff friend if I don't see the car first and look for signs of entry?  Call the police off the bat?


Thanks all.  Sorry.  I'm new to this.


**UPDATE EDIT:** Good news everyone!  I checked out the property with neighbors looking on after they called me that he had just left. An armed friend accompanied me (legal in my state). They said he always went around back.  I went around the house and there were OLD footprints (mostly covered in snow, barely visible) leading to each door, but there were deeper, fresher footprints that only went straight through the yard, straight to the back fence, hopped the fence, and went around the back neighbor's shed.

I entered the house and it was untouched.  Doors locked.  No indication he managed to enter the house.  Sinks and bathtub completely dry.

Something about rotting support posts (there is rust at the bottom of one of the support posts), and that foundation blocks have shifted. Again, no clue. Our realtor has known this inspector for 15 years and said she does NOT recommend this guy at all. But that is all irrelevant. We weren't given a chance to counter as well.

We've been living in this house for the last six years, and have spared no expense updating it, etc. We are OK to carry the mortgage on this house for a while, but are wondering what we can do. If this is an issue which will come up again and again in subsequent home inspections, we will never be able to sell the house. 

What can we do? Would it be worth getting our own inspection? Can we get a copy of their inspection? Since there aren't enough people even viewing the house, it is just so difficult to lose a prospective buyer. The wife is inconsolable, the process is just proving to be a real source of stress. Any help would be appreciated. We are in NY if that matters. Thanks!

**EDIT**: (12/05/2012) Thank you everyone for your advice! We got a structural engineer and a waterproofing and basement contractor to individually inspect the basement, and both stated the same =&gt; NO issues with the foundation. It is structurally absolutely sound with no shifting. The inspector who gave this house a failing grade is known to be a fear monger in these parts, failing houses to get repeat business. How this guy is still licensed, much less in business, I will never know. We are looking at recourses now. It is too late to salvage this buyer, but the hopes are high for another eventual buyer.

my intent is that rent would cover mortgage payments as well as everything else. if my mortgage is 1k a month and each unit is 600 to rent, lets say 3 are rented. thats 1800 bucks so it could pay the mortgage and then 800 put into a seperate account to pay for unexpected maintenance issues. of course i would have cash set aside all ready for this. even if i have to pay 500 every now and then for repairs i still come out on top.

what i am looking for is someone with experience, someone who has gone down the unknown road and what kind of issues they had to deal with. the way i see it, the whole house pays for itself, and maybe i do pay for some out of pocket every now and then, but it would be long term investment and would build equity (never make minimum payments).

Some clarity. I realized I've come off as an ass, which was not my intent. I'm a new landlord, and I was just trying to prevent getting screwed by a tenant who has no knowledge of how to use a thermostat. I've already called HVAC.
The reason I was asking about rules is that the description the tenant gave me of the issue is exactly 1) The issue that these types of units have. 2) A slight exaggeration. The temperature was not nearly as drastically different as the tenant said.
I spoke with other owners of the unit type, HVAC, and other landlords. I am not trying to be a cheap landlord. It's been hotter than hell the last couple days and AC is a needed relief. I would never try to save a few bucks by not addressing an issue.

My poorly addressed question was merely trying to understand what my obligations. If the tenant wants it to be an 55 in each room despite being 110 outside, is that something I have to accommodate? I realize I'm exaggerating a circumstance, but I'm just trying to learn.

For those who thing I'm a terrible landlord, I hope my future posts will change your mind of that. I know actions, not words are the indicator of such things.

Their seems to be mixed results with providing refrigerator, washing machine and dryer but I feel like most people renting a house expect the full set of appliances.
I know rent usually includes utilities for apartments but I assumed when renting a house the utilities are separate. Is that right? Should I have the tenants take the power and water into their name, or try to include some average in the rent?

1322258790.0,13,self.RealEstate,mp9er,Advice for First-Time CA Home Buyers - My wonderful/horrible experience buying a condo,15,2,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/mp9er/advice_for_firsttime_ca_home_buyers_my/,"Having spent the last 12 months buying a home, a condo to be exact, I want to document and share my experiences so that others may learn from it. 

Basics: Condo in Southern California
Previously sold in 2006 for ~$450K; Short-sale. 

Buying a home can be a long and complex process. As a perfectionist, I wanted to understand everything. But even with a good head on my shoulder, I quickly found there is too much to read and understand. If you are juggling full-time work plus buying a house, likely, you won't have time to read and understand everything. 

**Tip 1:** Don't try to understand and micro-manage everything. There is simply too much information. Instead, prioritize and get the most important pieces of information correct. 

I started the home buying process by doing some general research (e.g., reading a whole lot of ""first-time home buyers"" type of info. Looking back, I it was an disorganized process and I probably read and re-read a bunch of information that I didn't know exactly how to use. 

Thus, to help you, first I'll summarize the key people you'll have to deal with throughout the process. 

1. Buyer: YOU
2. Buyer's Agent: The person showing you the homes, ""helping"" you through the process.
3. Mortgage Broker / Direct Lender: The person(s) giving you the loan to buy the property, unless you are paying all in cash.
4. Escrow Agent: The person helping with the closing process, making sure what the Buyer and Seller are doing is compliant with various instructions and regulations. 
5. Title Agent: The person giving you title insurance for the property. 
6. Homeowner Insurance Agent: The person giving you hazard insurance (fire, flood, earthquake).
7. Homeowner Association / Homeowner's Association Mgmt Company: If you are purchasing a property in a planned community, the community association.
8. Seller's Agent: The person helping the Seller sell the home.
9. Seller: The current person trying to sell the home.
10. Seller's Lender: The lender(s) that own the loan on the property you want to buy, if there is a loan.
11. General Property Inspector / Pest Inspector / Appraiser / Others: Other folks you'll have to talk to likely at some point in time during he process. More on some of these folks later. 

As you can see, there are a lot of people involved in the process. I definitely didn't recognize this until I reflected back on the process a few days before closing. Most likely, when you start shopping for a home with your Buyer's Agent, he or she won't tell you all of the above. He or she will just start asking you about what house you want to buy and show you around. Not the route I'd go, but let me tell you why I think most Buyer's Agents don't tell you the above: 
1) tell you all this information takes a lot of time and you might be only a potential client. If I spend all the time educating the Buyer but the Buyer uses another Buyer's Agent, I'd have wasted a lot of time for little gain 
2) if most people knew how complex the home buying process is going to be, they'd walk out the door 

**Tip 2:** Tip 2: Learn what role each of the person above will do for you. Research it online. Ask your Buyer Agent. (Some of the folks will be recommended by your Buyer's Agent.) In any case, your Buyer's Agent is there to ""help"" educate you, but recognize that he or she won't help with everything.

For me, I began by interviewing a bunch of Buyer's Agents (as recommended by several websites) before picking my agent. Good advice in general, but pretty useless in hindsight. Why? Because even after spending time doing a bunch of interviews, my Buyer's Agent didn't live up to my expectations (perhaps my expectations are high).  

**Tip 3:**Interview a few Buyer's Agent and pay one agent to go through the ENTIRE home buying process with you. For first-time home buyers, the more knowledgeable/educated you are, , the better the actual process.  While most agents are going to say ""I'll be there to guide you when it's time"", usually, guidance at that point in time is too little too late. Recognize that once an offer to buy an house is accepted, there is only typically 17 days to get everything done and you likely have a job to balance at the same time. 


My first agent: I picked because he had 1) great credentials, 2) good recommendations from past customers that I personally called and 3) lots of experience (been an agent for 10+ yrs). But after I started working with him, he started handing me to his daughter (also an agent) to lead. I didn't mind that at the beginning, but wasn't the excited about the idea. 

Perhaps I didn't have the right working style and had asked more questions than typically, but ultimately our relationship didn't work. 

My second agent: I picked someone again with experience and specific knowledge of the condo area I was looking to purchase. She's been extremely helpful to getting everything together and pushing me to make decisions. Again, an extremely nice person, but overall, I didn't feel I got everything I had ""expected"" from my agent. 

I think its partly because I couldn't really trust my agent to act in my best interest knowing the incentive structure for an agent (more on this later) and partly because I wasn't always the most communicative with her about all my intentions (again, back to the incentive structure). 

**Tip 4:** Having a Buyer's Agent who is willing to educate you and put you first is the most important. If you are smart and hardworking, you can probably pickup all the other pieces of information. But an experienced agent who can tell you about the pitfalls is key. The fundamental problem for first-time home buyers is that there will be questions you do not know you need to ask until too late. That's where a good Buyer's Agent comes into play. 

But recognize most good/great agents probably don't like first-time home buyers. Why? Several reason. 

1. First-time home buyers are more needy and require more hand holding, as you can see from this post. 
2. First-time home buyers typically buy smaller/cheaper homes =&gt; resulting in smaller commissions for the Buyer's Agent. 
3. First-time home buyers may talk to multiple agents before either picking an agent or not going through with the process =&gt; thus if the first Buyer's Agent spends a lot of time educating the first-time home buyer, he/she would have wasted time with no gain.

I'm not a full time landlord, so while the number of phone calls I get from our current tenants is not much, it's enough to be a problem in my schedule.  For example, during a heat wave we got a call that the AC was not working.  I had to drive over there only to discover that they just needed to turn the breaker back on.  There was a problem with a sink backing up.  I had to check out the problem, call a plumber, meet the plumber later for him to give an estimate, meet them again when they came to do the actual work etc.

So we are thinking about signing up or hiring a property manager.  From the look of things it seems anywhere between 5-10% of rent is the expected fee, but it isn't clear what type of scope of work I should expect from them.  

So my question for those with SFHs that use a property manager, what do you pay them, and what do they provide you for that service?  Is it worth while in your opinion?

But while it sounds relatively simple, there are many investors who have had misfortune when pursuing this strategy, due to budgets and time frames blowing out, arguments erupting and the like.  

Here are some thoughts on what property investors need to know in order to complete a successful renovation on time and on budget.  

1.	Choose properties that need mainly cosmetic work

Investors need to avoid properties with structural damage, as this is often when expensive problems occur.  If you already own the property you definitely need to leave that part to the experts.  

2.	Find a valuer

One of the biggest misconceptions investors have is that the more they spend renovating a property, the more profit they will make.  This isn't always the case and investors need to be careful of under capitalising as well as overcapitalising.  A valuer can tell you if your $30,000 kitchen renovation will actually add $30,000 to your home’s value. 

3.	Be realistic when doing it yourself

Most novice renovators attempting DIY go under budget when estimating the costs.  A tip is to double your expected cost and time frame and then work out if you’re still going to make a profit.  

Also investors add up the cost of taking time away from a job or family and see if the potential profit outweighs the potential risk. 

4.	Use a project manager

There are too many risks involved in managing a project alone.  Some tradespeople capitalise on investors’ lack of experience – in terms of cost, timelines and attention to detail.  Handling the renovation yourself could save money initially, but hiccups along the way might turn your $40,000 renovation into a $60,000 - $80,000 job in the long run – not to mention the added time it might take.  Each week you go over time is a week’s lost rent or extra mortgage repayment.  

Using a project manager will often get you access to trade prices rather than retail, so it may well pay for itself straight away.  

When investors do their research, purchase a property well, renovate correctly and with the right advice, renovations go well - potentially resulting in owners earning tens of thousands of dollars in equity in the first year alone.  Even if the property market hasn’t moved in your local area, renovations can create artificial growth in your property’s value.

Seeing that the cost was high, I called the property manager and asked for a permission (also because the technicians needed permission from our property manager). On the phone, she said ""it will have to be done, since if left, it could cause all sorts of trouble."" She gave me a permission to pay using my check, also saying that she will deduct it from the rent. Note that she also emailed me cc'ing the owner saying ""this is to clarify that whatisitbro will pay 1400 out of his pocket and that amount will be deducted from next months rent.""

fast forward couple of hours, the owner says that she will not pay me for the repair, claiming that the previous tenants said they saw no problems with it. and that its our fault that the drain overflew

Now, I do not know what to do. The lease even said that if I find any faults on the house within five days of the lease, they will repair it.

I showered once, didn't even settle down to even begin drain anything.. I really need your help. any advice?

**TL:DR - I paid 1400 dollars for sewage backflow flood damages, with a written permission and instruction from the property manager that the amount will be deducted from the rent. Now, the homeowner is claiming that it is my fault, and that she will not pay me back. Note this flood happened the day of move-in. I will appreciate any advice.**

**FINAL UPDATE: The landlord emailed me back after couple of conversations with her. She apologized for the situation and the confusion and said she instructed the prop manager that the deduction is okay. She went ahead and called carpet installers and made an account with them so she could directly pay this time.

Our relationship seems to be getting better, and I hope we won't have anything like this again.**",,False,,t5_2qipl,1375834326.0,,,True,t3_1jpm5w,http://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/1jpm5w/need_advice_from_experienced_people_sewage_water/,

With some determination and advice from this subreddit, I've managed to pay down debt, set up a emergency fund, and have 10% (in addition to my 6% match and 4% gift from employer) going into my 401k. There are two things I want to work towards doing: I want to start contributing more to my rothIRA and build a rental unit as an investment.

Right now I'm looking at the Seattle and Portland markets. I'm more confident with the Seattle market, as my experience living there and watching the development and gentrification over the better part of the last decade makes me feel like I make an informed decision on the location.

I can't say if it's common everywhere, but these townhouse complexes have been popping up all over Seattle for the last few years. I even lived in one for 2 years. 10 4-story units on a relatively small plot of land.

Ideally, what I would want to do would be to build the units, and live in one for a time.

I know there are multiple schools of thoughts on rental properties, but  I really don't know where to start. With how many of them I see, with really only mild, aesthetic differences, is there some architecture/engineering company that has a cookie cutter design they keep selling?

How do you go about acquiring the property or the loan? Is demolishing a building that exists (a small one) a reasonable cost to incur in the process?

Thank you for your time,

About three years ago my parents went through *A Series of Unfortunate Events* that left them:

* Homeless
* Unemployed
* Disabled
* Assetless
* Incomeless

In order to be a *Good Son* and to keep them off the streets, my wife and I found a low-income apartment they could live in and have been paying for 100% of their life since then.  Rent on their apartment is $750/mo and utilities are around $50/mo.

Two months ago they were approved for disability payments from the Social Security Administration. The final calculations aren't complete but it appears their income will be around $1200/mo. They have begun to pay their own rent but I am still paying their utilities and some other non-housing expenses.

Their current housing is in a high-crime area and they are over 1,000 miles away from me. My wife and I would like to move them closer so I can be of better assistance as they continue to age and suffer from poor health. Having them live in the same household as us is neither practical nor desirable.

**This post is about real estate, not about my parent's situation.** I have explained the above only because it helps explain my motivation for purchasing property.

I am a homeowner with wife, children, and steady employment. I have never been a landlord and never really thought about real estate as an investment. I can come up with 25%-40% down payment for a property for my parents. I would need to take out a loan for the remainder.

I can't afford to throw away the 25%-40% I use as a down payment. This is basically college money for my young children and I need this to be an investment property - even if the investment doesn't pay off for many years.

When applying for a property loan I believe this would basically be positioned as a rental property. The intention is for my parents to make monthly payments to me for housing. Ideally that payment would cover the costs of the property, but that is not a hard requirement.

**First Question**: Is there some way to present all this to the bank that would make better sense than calling it a rental property, or is that really the only category it falls into?

So far I have thought about three sorts of properties.

My first thought was to find a one-story condominium (need to avoid stairs). I liked the idea of a condominium because neither my parents nor I would have to be responsible for exterior maintenance (mowing, yard-work, snow shoveling). They cannot do that work and I can barely keep up with my own home. However, typical Association fees for my area run around $200/mo and that seems somewhat high for the services provided that I care about.

My second thought was to find a small single-family ranch-style home to put them in. This puts the duty to do all the yard work and snow removal back on me - but I think I can hire that out for less than equivalent Association dues would cost.

My third thought was to try to turn this into a small income-producing situation and purchase a two-unit duplex. My parents could occupy one unit and hypothetically the renter of the second unit could be responsible for yard care and snow removal (or I could hire that out).

**Second Question**: Am I missing any obvious choices? Does any one of the above stand out as a better choice than the others?

I have done no research and have no knowledge of any tax or legal implications of effectively becoming landlord to my parents. So my **third question** is whether there is anything significant here I should be aware of.

Thanks in advance for any suggestions or advice.  This isn't a typical real estate question and it has been a highly stressful three years.",,False,,t5_2qipl,False,,,True,t3_1j3yg5,http://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/1j3yg5/any_advice_on_buying_a_rental_property_for_my/,

My mom (mid 50s) has pretty bad credit due to a bankruptcy in her past (long story, but it's really not her fault). She's currently renting, but she really wants her own place again. Her current landlord keeps raising the rent each year (which isn't surprising), and her neighbors are horrible (late nice police action, constantly barking dogs, people screaming at kids, etc.). The only loan my mom can get at this point is an FHA loan, but that comes with extra fees and few sellers in the area will accept a buyer with an FHA loan.


My (mid 20s) credit, on the other hand, is really good. I currently split rent with a friend in an apartment close to my work and about 2 hours from where my mom lives. Our thought was that I would buy a house in the area in which my mom currently lives, and she would use that as her primary residence and transfer money to my account to pay for the mortgage, utilities, taxes, etc. I would stay in the rental I'm in at the moment close to work (as long as I keep my current job). This property would most likely be a long-term buy that I will probably keep as a rental property even after my mom vacates the property (for whatever reason). One worry with the long-term buy is that I plan on moving out of the state in the next 5 years or so, and I expect my mom to still be in the house at that time. And after she vacates, I would need to manage a rental from another state.


I originally wasn't planning on claiming any of the money my mom transfers to me as income. This was based on a number of family friends and coworkers saying they either have this exact arrangement (either with their kids in a second home or grandparents in their family home) or know someone who does. My real estate and mortgage brokers told me the same thing (apparently there's a TON of people currently doing this, some not even between family). My brokers also told me that in 3 years when my mom's credit score improves, we can do a quitclaim deed to transfer the property to my mom and refinance the mortgage in my mom's name. So this may only be a 3 year thing on my end.


But I wanted to make sure I wasn't going to set myself up for an audit in the future (particularly since I plan on starting up some business with friends in the coming years). So I started reading up on the IRS site about renting, and now I'm a bit confused. Based on my limited understanding, this arrangement could be considered renting, which would mean I would need to claim the money my mom gives me as income (most definitely pushing me into a higher tax bracket), even though I wouldn't be making any profit off of the arrangement (except perhaps for the mortgage that gets paid down). Where I start getting lost is when the IRS site starts going into personal use, what constitutes personal use, what personal use means for considering the property a rental, and all the stuff about deductions. The amount of money that my mom transfers to me each month will probably be below Fair Market Value for that type of house and the area, which seems to bring with it even more tax exceptions and rules.


I've already been pre-approved for a loan and found a nice townhome that's in good condition (and costs less than my pre-approval amount) in the town where my mom lives. My mom is ready to pull the trigger on this, but it really all falls to me at this point. I'm not really sure how to proceed here, and any advice is extremely appreciated. Thanks!

**edit #1:** The mortgage loan I've been pre-approved for is a primary mortgage.

**edit #2:** As I'm still unclear on the whole personal use issue, I'm wondering if it matters that I will still have the majority of my possessions in the new house with my mom. I also tend to visit her once a month for 2-3 days, so I will be living in the house probably about a month total out of the year.

**edit #3:** Thank you everyone for your responses! After speaking to some accountants and more mortgage brokers, I've decided that the original arrangement will not legally work. A primary mortgage requires me to live in the house, which I would not. So I would need an investment mortgage, requires twice the down payment and additional cash reserves. Legally, I can't make this work. As much as I want to help my mom, I don't want to go to jail for mortgage fraud and tax evasion.

P.S. I'm still not sure this arrangement will be cheaper for my mom than renting, but I'm trying to figure that out now.

My husband and I are purchasing our first home soon. We just had an offer accepted on a home that we have fallen in LOVE with. The area is fantastic, well kept, mature landscaping (pretty rare in the city we're looking in). The back yard is like a park, grass and trees (we're in a desert so about 1 in 20 homes have this) and the home has been well loved and taken care of. It's in the perfect place for our commute, 10 minutes from his mom's house and 10 minutes from mine. It’s in a good school district and close to the business center of town. No sex offenders and no foreclosures in the area. 

BUT it's only a 2bd home. It does have 2 baths (master and guest). We already have 2 kids (a boy and girl they're both under 2 years old) so our plan was to have them share a room for a while anyway... we were hoping to add a room in a space that would be very easy to continue the flow of the home (there's an inset corner that's already in the bedroom area).... in our area additions run about $100/sq ft. The house is currently 1600 sq ft.

My question is... are we out of our minds? We submitted a low offer and the seller met us in the middle with our closing costs paid... So, we're getting a good deal, we hope. There's another home up the street currently on the market for 15% more than what we're paying for our home (we're paying 143,000). The houses were built in the early 70s. Many of the homes in this neighborhood have been remodeled and have fantastic curb appeal (ours doesn't, it may actually be the ugliest in the neighborhood but it's been empty for a while). We're buying the home from a trust.

The neighborhood is filled with 2bd, 3bd, 4br houses. The 2bd were designed for retired folks (all 1 story) and most of the other homes are single level. There's no way we could afford a 3bd in this area, they run around 180k and the 4bd are about 210k. 

Pretty much everyone I'm talking to thinks my husband and I are crazy. My husband and I think we're geniuses. It's simple... buy a 2bd at a discount (because no one wants them) and add a room later (we're thinking 5yrs)! Then we get the home we want, in the neighborhood we want at a price that’s acceptable.Right? Now I'm beginning to wonder if we ARE crazy.

I want to withdraw money from a brokerage account, savings, and Roth IRA *contributions* and use the money for a down payment on a duplex rental property. The neighborhood I'm looking to buy into is near a very large university (20k+ students) that my wife and I think is on the upswing. It's mostly a commuter college but they're building dorms and taking steps to improve the local campus. The neighborhood just outside the campus is very bad, but the neighborhood seems to be improving rapidly (home prices are up 12% Y-o-Y but still very low, many foreclosures for $50k or less). We live on the other side of town, about 20 minutes away by car.

The numbers:

* Duplexes are about $80k-120k for a 2/2 duplex
* Rental rates are about $650-750 for a 2 bedroom
* Taxes are about $3000-3500

Assumptions:

* 25% down (about $30-40k)
* 4% interest 30-year fixed
* $3k/year maintenance
* 10% vacancy rate

* ~12-16% before-tax ROI (ignoring appreciation/deprecation)

I've refinanced my mortgage down to 1487, plus 99 HOA and 15 sewer = 1601.   2 years ago I could only get a renter at 1500/month - 7% mgmt fee = 1309/month.  

I owe 214k on the home, but equivalent homes in the region at the high end are selling for 190/200k.   If I were to have it appraised, it would probably go at about 205-210 range.   

So Im trying to figure out if I can sell or if I have to rent it out for a couple more years.   It seems like the math points to having to rent it out, I have the property out for both sale and rent, and the asking 1650 for the rental price in order to close the monthly gap.   

My question is:  Is there any way I can sell the place without having to put any money out of pocket ?  This may seem incredibly silly but Id much prefer to get rid of the property at this point.   Even though I have the tax benefits of the mortgage interest, there are enough ongoing repairs that the house is an overall loss for me (nearly 5k last year).

Any advice would be appreciated.

EDIT:  Breaking out the mortgage, last month it was 22% to principle (327), 45% to interest (670), and the rest to escrow (490).   Escrow handles taxes and insurance on the property.

Since it was Saturday, and in our contract we had it written that we would have 3 days to obtain pre-approval specific to the property, our Realtor stated it would not be a problem as we had been pre-approved for a home purchase for well above what the house was listed at.  So obtaining the property specific pre-approval would not be an issue and we would be able to get it on Monday.  

This morning at about 10am our Realtor called and stated that the Owners' Realtor had told her that they had accepted another offer from someone who had a pre-approval specific to the property. 

My Realtor is furious that the owners' Realtor had stated that the owner had accepted our offer only to state that they took another less than 15 hours later.  She stated that she is going to call the other Realtor's broker and inform them that this occurred.  She also stated that she would contact a Real Estate lawyer and see if we had an legal recourse. 

We really would like to obtain this home and begin the process of owning it.  I know that there is many other homes out there in central Ohio but we had really felt like we had obtained our home especially since they had accepted our offer and told our Realtor via text message.

**Situation:**
I've identified an area where I would like to buy an investment property -- it has the perfect combination of walkability, affluence, etc.

A wild property appears! 1500sqft 4bd 2ba + 4 car garage, built in 1800, in HORRIBLE condition -- IDEAL location. I could pick it up for ~70k, it needs to be stripped to the studs and redone entirely. Other single family homes in the area with these specs are worth ~400k, but this home can be zoned for a duplex or triplex.

My dad is a carpenter/general contractor and thinks he could renovate it for ~$100k, which will have me at ~200k in to it after all said and done (rounding up for some wiggle room). 2bd 1ba in the area rent for ~1100, which should give me an income of $2200/mo -- more than enough to pay for a traditional 200k mortgage + taxes/insurance.

Here is my question:
Do I need to put together a business plan and get a commercial loan? Then after it is built I can live in one side (as a duplex) and have it appraised and remortgage it as a residence? What would be the ideal setup?

I'll take any advice here with caution, but would like some opinions on people smarter than myself.

We put in an offer on a house in mid August which was accepted by the seller.  We went with the USDA loan program through our mortgage broker to take advantage of a really fantastic program for homes in rural areas.  Around the beginning of Sept, we were officially approved through our broker's underwriter, and the file went off to USDA for final approval, with an estimated wait time of 4-6wks.  Our broker told us the file was sent, and that we now just ""sit back and wait.""

After 5wks, my realtor and the seller began to get nervous.  So, my realtor decided to do his homework and call USDA himself for a status update.  USDA said our file was not in their system, and that they have no record of it ever coming to them.  Basically, our broker messed up and forgot to send it.

This means that our file had to be re-submitted at the back of the line, but we were given a shorter, 7-10 day turnaround time this round.  We're now on day 12.  We do have 100% confirmation with USDA that our file is there, however.

The problem is that if we don't hear something by Monday, we are out of contract with our seller (after getting an extension with our financing contingency being removed), and the deal is off.  Being that we have until wednesday to have our apartment cleaned out and keys in, this is all very, very problematic.

The question:  In a case like this, is there legal recourse that can be taken against the broker?  We were mislead, and essentially lied to about the status of our file for 1.5 months.  We're now paying for it in borrowed time in our rental, and many other expenses associated with staying here.

Kinda venting:  As part of our retirement plan we lent money on an old 19 space park - looking forward to regular monthly interest income payments.

  The potable water system is pretty much a giant drip irrigation system (city had a $7000+ water bill against the park we had to settle up on).  The last remaining occupants, who have been without water coming through pipes for over a year - and of course not paying rent during that time - have been given their walking papers - no desire to have tenants we can't provide a decent place for.

So now we are going through the abandoned property procedure on four mobiles still on site, buying the mobile from the last tenant, having the blackberry vines, 10' high hedges, and 3 foot high grass cut back to expose the original park outlines.  Oh.  and having one of 8 septic tanks pumped for the benefit of the holdout occupant.  Also having truckloads of our borrower's moldy debris picked up and disposed of.  Still need to get a roof on the house and tarp the trailers before the rains set in. 

Looking forward to putting a chain across the entrance and starting on getting the house remodeled and the water system for the park up to snuff and making the spaces attractive and rentable... next summer.  I'm too old for this shit.

My next tenant is probably going to pay $1500+ more a month. (yup well placed buy).

Home equity loan at about 8k. Im only 28, no kids wife etc, and spend 0 of my income on the house since I want the house to pay for itself. I was thinking about dumping the extra rent into the home equity to pay it off and pay off the mortgage a little. I think this high rent will last about 5-6 years before it levels off at around 1300. Since I want to buy more houses and do this again, should I just try to pay off this house and leverage it? Pay just a little bit more on loans and hoard the cash?

I was wondering if this principal is the same for buying into condos. Most of the condos in this area have HOAs that would take care of most of the major things you have to worry about with a house (roof, plumbing, etc). Most of the buildings have centralized water heating and some have centralized AC or no AC, and some have community laundry spaces.

So, the way I see it, there wouldn't be a lot of unexpected expenses with owning a condo. Worst case scenario would be all the kitchen appliances need replacing. Am I thinking about this correctly, or am I missing something? Would you be safe keeping a smaller maintenance fund for this type of investment?

This obviously assumes the HOA is run properly and keeps a good emergency fund to prevent any sudden assessments.

We ended up not being able to secure the downpayment based on the sale of our current home.  So the sale has fallen through at the last minute.

I'm working with a realtor to try to buy my first home, and because of how quickly houses are being sold (less than 24 hours from listing to pending) we've been looking primarily at HUD homes.

The mortgage/loan stuff is through a major bank, and I have enough savings make a 10% downpayment and do a conventional loan, which seems preferable to the alternatives (FHA).


The problem I'm facing is that the majority of these HUDs are going for above asking/list price - between $3,000 and $13,000 for this particular area, but upwards of $18-20k above asking in other areas. However, as I understand it, if the appraised value is lower than the offer, the difference will need to be paid up front (can't be financed).

Assuming this is true, then that means that these people either have an extra $10-20k in cash to pay the difference, or else their appraisals are coming in much higher than the HUD appraisal (which, I believe, is a FHA appraisal and is used to set the list price). I'm guessing the former is unlikely, but when I talk to my realtor or my mortgage guy they both tell me there's no way of knowing for sure what number my appraiser will come back with.


I'm essentially in a position where I have to offer over list price to have a chance of winning the bid, but have to pay the overage out of pocket up front. To use a gaming analogy it's a pay-to-win situation - and I can't afford it! Are there additional details or things that I'm not accounting for, or have I misunderstood anything, or am I simply stuck paying extra money up front to make sure I win the bid? Would I be better off trying to catch a non-HUD sale within the extremely limited windows they are on the market? Should I just renew my lease on my apartment for another 6-12 months and hope it's more of a buyer's market by then?

Any advice is welcome!

The seller accepted our offer that is lower than asking after we worked with our dual agent to go with a lower commission.  However, the appraisal came in 65k lower.  The appraiser used 7 comparables of which 2 were sold back in Sep/Oct of last year and adjusted them by 5% when in reality the prices appreciated by 10-15% here (I regret to this day not jumping in last year as the prices went up so much).  He also used 2 recent ones that were 3+ levels but the condo we are buying is a 2 level which is much more desirable (and has an associated premium compared to 3+ level plans).  Typically, the 3+ level condos sell for 90-100k lower.  He also used 2 sales from Jan/Feb when exact plans sold in April/May 2 miles away.

1368328283.0,13,self.RealEstate,1e5y8p,Want to build a small apartment complex or multi-family home next door,19,6,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/1e5y8p/want_to_build_a_small_apartment_complex_or/,"Hi all, I'm new to investment properties and landlording, so I'm taking it slow trying to put together this business plan.

I own a house on a lake in upstate New York known for relatively affluent (for the area) waterfront residential properties. I also own the vacant neighboring lot which is about the same size: 1 acre of land with 100 ft of waterfront. They are separate lots and I pay taxes on them separately. Right now the vacant lot is all trees, but most of the neighboring lots in both directions on the lake either have houses or small businesses on them.

I'm interested in clearing the trees and constructing an apartment building or a multi-family home on the vacant lot. I believe such a building could house two apartments luxuriously, four apartments comfortably, and maybe up to six with careful space planning, with the goal of each apartment possessing equally striking views of the lake.

I'm not too concerned with the one-time expenses relating to construction. I can liquidate some investments to deal with that. What worries me is making sure when all is said and done I end up with a property I can rent out for a reliable profit.

So, some questions:

- How can I determine what construction limitations I have with regards to zoning so I can figure out how many apartments I can reasonably construct?

- Since total taxes+insurance on my main house are around $7k/yr, I'm assuming I'd need to pay a similar figure for the neighboring property once I build it up, or perhaps slightly more. Maybe $12k/yr? Is there some way to estimate this accurately?

- How can I determine average monthly maintenance costs on such a property? I'm not very handy, so I would need to hire help for big jobs like replacing water heaters, or roofing, etc. I am willing to manage the property myself though in terms of advertising, finding tenants, dealing with tenants, etc. And I'm willing to learn how to do common maintenance tasks, but I don't have much confidence that I'll be any good at it right now, as I've never owned an apartment building. :)

- How can I determine how much to charge in rent? See below...

Some facts about rentals in the area:

Similar apartments to what I'd like to construct seem to bottom out at $700/mo but go as high as $1500/mo and I'm not entirely sure why the range varies so much since they seem so similar on the surface, but I have some hypotheses. High end properties on the lake (e.g. full-size large houses like the one I have now) can approach $2k/mo to rent. The highest I've seen is $2600/mo, which was a much nicer property than my house and on the more urban side of the lake.

My house is about a 20 minute commute from the more urban side of the lake, which is considered a relatively short commute for the area, as on the most remote shores it can be up an hour from civilization, which leads me to believe that while I cannot command the highest rents, I could perhaps command rents somewhere in the middle of the range and attract upper-middle class suburban tenants.

Some napkin math:

- Maybe $1k/mo in taxes+insurance?

- Maybe $1k/mo in maintenance? Would reserve $12k/yr to deal with whatever maintenance issues may come up.

- That means I'd need around $2k/mo in rental income on average to break even in a ""bad"" maintenance year.
- Or put another way, assuming four apartments at $1k/mo rental rate, I'd need no worse than 50% vacancy to break even in a ""bad"" maintenance year.

- If all four apartments were filled at that rental rate I'd be making a considerable profit ($2k-$3k in profit per month after expenses depending on how costly maintenance is each year) assuming I'm doing my napkin math right.

However, all those numbers seem based on pretty shallow research to me. I don't know if $1k/mo is too low or too high for rent. And I don't know if those tax, insurance, or maintenance expenses are anywhere near accurate. So I'm reaching out to you guys, the experts, for help on determining how I can arrive at more accurate expenses/income estimates.

So what do you think /r/RealEstate, Is this business plan pretty good or pretty insane? What other things should I consider that I haven't considered? I'm not gonna make a move on this until I feel comfortable that I've estimated all the financials accurately.

Do you think updating that bathroom will have a significant effect on selling the house quickly OR provide a worthwhile return on selling that house?

Hoping someone can help shed some light on my situation.

I'm in the process of relocating to the Santa Clarita Valley in California.  There's something of a housing boom going on now and it has been almost impossible to find a home to buy.  I don't have an extensive wish list at all (IMO, could be wrong) in terms of a home.  I will buy the ugliest house on the block, really don't care.  Trying to avoid a mello-roos though.

All I'm trying to buy is a 3/2 standard sale single family home.  Every home my realtor puts an offer on receives multiple offers over list.  The last home I put an offer in on, I put $15k over list and still got rejected.

My pre-approval is solid, I'm not sure what I can do to improve my attractiveness as a potential buyer, other than throwing more money over list, but I do not have unlimited funds and I'm worried that if I threw too much money at a house, it wouldn't appraise correctly.

This is my second home, the first time I bought, I submitted an offer where the seller had 48 hours to review.  The way things are unfolding this time around, the sellers are waiting until a slew of offers come in on their own terms and just picking the one they like best.

I made one offer with a 48 hour signback and didn't hear anything for 5 days.  It almost seems unethical?  

I would never even relocate to this area but my son was just diagnosed with a medical disorder and I am moving to the area so he can be closer to a treatment center.  I feel like every week that passes is time he isn't getting help, so I do have some sense of urgency.  For that reason, I am trying to avoid buying a short sale also.

Can anyone offer any advice as to what I can do to look better on paper?

These were only asking prices.  The deadline was 5 pm, and they missed it because his clients couldnt get to a fax machine.

When talking to our agent last night, their agent said casually that they had another offer, but were still going to try to get back to us with their counter, even though the deadline is up.

Also states that the electrical panel is 200 AMP with no defects.

Upon inspection, we found that the roof was missing shingles and no flashed properly. As such, it has a leak. We had two roofing contractors go out to the house, both of whom confirmed that the roof needed to be replaced (there are two layers of shingles on it already). One of the contractors estimated the second layer of shingles to be about 18 years old.

The electrical panel was found to be 100 AMP, going into a 150 breaker. While this isn't a huge deal (it'll need replacing, but we're not nearly as worried about this as the roof) it was improperly disclosed.

Lastly, the sellers said in their disclosures that there had been no water penetration in the basement. Upon inspection, we found that the basement windows had indeed leaked previously, and there were water marks running down the walls.

The sellers are refusing to address any of these issues, which of course is their right. I'm trying to determine whether we could be entitled to get them to pay us for the inspection costs (~$500), as our concerns are items which were improperly disclosed.

We manage approximately 100 properties. The process we go through to pay the bills is as follows:

* 1) Receive bills at the office from Electric + Cable company for each individual apartment unit
* 2) The assistant (myself or our intern) has to write checks for these bills one by one
* 3) The office manager has to sign the 200+ checks for the cable and gas
* 4) The assistant/intern has to then make envelopes, with the corresponding check and bill receipt for each apartment unit, and send all 200+ envelopes back out to the cable/electric company.
* 5) We file away all 200 of these receipts until the last week of the month
* 6) When the last week of the month comes, we have to send invoices to the tenants so they can pay us for both rent and reimburse us for the electric/cable bill that we paid.  
* 7) To send out the monthly invoices, we have a merged document between excel and Word. You enter in the different charges into excel (cable, electric, cleaning lady charges, etc) and they are created into an invoice on Word. We collect all the electric/cable receipts and then enter them into word. 
* 8) Then (this is getting tedious, I know!) we print out these invoices, make a copy of the electric/cable bills, and pair the corressponding invoices to the bills and individually email/mail out the invoices to each tenant.
* 9) Finally, we file away the original copy of the electric/cable receipts along with copies of the invoices, into their respective filing cabinets. The office now has approximately 4 filing cabinets (5 shelves each) all PACKED to the brim with these receipts/invoices from the past 25 years.

I purchased my condominium in 2008 when I was 22 years old. I had just graduated from college and I wanted to take advantage of the $8000 first time home buyer tax credit (the one you didn't have to pay back). I purchased my unit for 95K. The unit was originally purchased in 2004 for ~120k. My realtor assured me that the market could only get better, and that I was getting a heck of a deal. Young and naive, with stars in my eyes, I bought the condo.

After I moved in, I made close to 10K worth of improvements, most notably, replacing cheap carpet with high end laminate flooring (12mm, single plank), and replacing linoleum in the kitchen and bathroom with porcelain tile. Anyway, I got engaged last year and decided that it was time to sell my condo in hopes of buying a house. My fiance and I want to have children and we can't do that in my tiny condo. Problem is: it's been listed for a year now and although I have had ~15 showings, there hasn't been a single offer. I recently dropped the price down to 89K, which is basically the lowest I can go, seeing as though I owe about 88K on my mortgage. With realtor fees and closing costs, it will still end up being a loss, but hopefully only by a few thousand bucks.

Even at 89K for several months, there have been no offers, and few showings. My realtor assures me that there's nothing I can do to make my place more marketable (in terms if visual appeal) at this point. My HOA recently lost their FHA approval and does not feel the need to apply for another. In addition, there's been a rash of other foreclosures in my development, and condos are going for a steal. There were a couple last year (foreclosures) that sold in the low 70s, and one recently that sold for 82K.

I don't have an extra 10 or 15 thousand dollars to pay up my mortgage and sell for really cheap. My mortgagee is not interested in discussing a short sale with me unless I can show financial hardship, of which I have none. I also fear staying because I feel the HOA is mismanaging the development. Finally, due to the large numbers of foreclosures in the development, I know the HOA is hemorrhaging money due to back dues, and I fear a large assessment at some point in the near future. I want out, and I want out SOON.

I am considering keeping my unit listed through the summer real estate season and then, if it doesn't sell, stopping all payment on my mortgage and entering voluntary foreclosure. I already spoke with an attorney who told me that I do not need to fear being sued by my mortgage company. Therefore, my biggest concern is the personal effect it will have on my credit, and on my future spouses credit (he is not listed as an owner on the mortgage or deed)

Our mortgage payment went up $80.

When we bought our home (one side of duplex), it was valued around $100K. It was a "" 0 down, fixed"" loan. Today we owe about $80K, the home's value is now about $35K.

We haven't missed any mortgage payments, but we have definitely been living beyond our means, trying to pay for the house and buy *any* of my medicines, and I've reduced the dosages all I can.
Backstory at this link:
http://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/15j335/old_lady_chronic_illness_ashamed_and_terrified/

My husband loves this little house so much, but he says he'd rather have me.

We're blessed to have family that are too poor to help us with money, but they will give us a place to sleep, so we won't have to go on the street. 

I am extremely ignorant and ill-equipped when it comes to this kind of thing, and my husband is if anything, worse. He studied botany in school, and I studied advertising.

But everything I read seems to give opposite advice. 

The only thing they all agree on is that in my state (GA) no matter what we do, the mortgage company can get his check,  if someone buys the house for less than that.

**We don't have money to give a lawyer.**

They can also sue him, either for the whole $80K or to make up the difference, but he doesn't have any other houses or anything. They do know he has a job.

There are so many houses on our street that have had for sale signs up for years, I don't think there's much chance anyone will buy it at all, much less give them the whole $80K.

**Is there any (free) way to keep them from hunting him down at his job and taking his check to make up the difference?**

We'd like to be able to give our relatives something to help with food and utilities, and use the rest of the check to buy medicine, and he'll still need to put gas in the car to get to work.


Some additional information, as I know this is a subject people have strong feelings about. We were not living beyond our means when we bought the house. The payment was well within our budget. We did not have any debts, and we had good credit.

Had we known I was ill, had we known the medication co-pays and premiums would have risen so dramatically, we would not have agreed to any loan at all.

Some medicines I cut back on so my husband would not see me suffer. Some I stopped taking entirely so we could make the mortgage payment.

I did not expire, I just got sicker, and unable to earn income to replace the 2 clients that did not pay. (from work I did when I was able to buy all the medicine)

Now I'm not sure how I should go about trying to get this house, but our credit is mediocre. It appears I will have to do some fixing up to this house which isn't a problem. My father has built houses most of his life and still does it on the side sometimes and would do the fixing it up for free as long as I pay for the materials.

Within the last year I purchased a home.  I bought using only half of what the bank was willing to lend to me.  I love the new home and the location.  Here is one thing I have been thinking about lately:

My home is a corner lot.  To the side of it there is a 1/4 acre wooded vacant lot.  My property is fenced in by a wooden fence but my bedroom window faces this wooded lot.

I looked the property up online and I found that it was bought in the height of the market 2008 for $25,000 by a gentleman in his late 60's from NY.  (The property is in FL)


I'm really interested in trying to acquire this property to use for future expansion.  My goal would be to either get financing (money is cheap right now so that might do)  or if necessary I can use cash on it.  


Can anybody give tips or advice on how to plan the road map for this adventure?  Should I just call the property owner and straight up ask?   I think it's best if I don't state upfront that I live next door incase the property owner tries to use that against me in negotiations.


I'd love to hear any thoughts/advice or input on this.


Thanks everyone!

I know, everyone knows BofA sucks.  My SO is the one purchasing, and it was his choice (he had his reasons why he chose them, but it doesn't matter now).  But we live together and will continue to do so, so I say 'we' or 'us' (he does too).  Anyways, they've delayed our closing about 5 times now.  Our latest extension expires tomorrow, and but the sellers agreed to extend to Monday if it gets out of underwriting TODAY.  It's already late afternoon, it sure doesn't feel like it will happen.

My SO has provided EVERYTHING they have asked for, and more.  He anticipates their requests, is thorough, and very timely.  It doesn't matter.  They don't care.  It's obvious at this point that all of his materials were sent to underwriting at the last minute, not leaving enough to come back to us and ask for clarification or additional paperwork.  I don't blame the sellers for being fed up at this point. It was his (""our"") first home purchase, and now we're completely turned off by this process.

Our reasons for purchasing go beyond ""hey, let's buy a house""; Without going into details, we NEEDED to.  We explained our situation to them.  I realize that they deal with this stuff day in and day out, and are probably immune to sob stories at this point.  But we told them anyways.  Everyone involved (save for one branch manager) has a serious issue with communication.  From poorly written emails (do these people graduate HS?!) to super vague answers, it's like dealing with robots.

Not to mention the snotty attitudes and snappy comments.  We tried being polite and professional, yet still aggressive (i.e. not doormats).  It didn't matter.  I don't really know what anyone here can say to me.  Commiserate?  Words of advice?  We're both exhausted, and will just sign another year long lease if this doesn't go through (which I don't think it will).  Sure, renting is ""throwing money away"", but I don't know if we are up to dealing with this BS all over again.

Even compared to the lower-priced comparables, it was an absolute steal.  Evidently the FHA underwriter didn't think so.  The appraisal came in just above our sale price, but the underwriter is calling BS and dropping it by $6K because the other houses on the block *happened* to sell for $6-10K less.  I can tell you that there is no comparison - as can my realtor, who sold two of those places.  The other sellers had their house on the market for at least 6 months so they were getting desperate (ours was on for less than 1).  Among other things, I truly don't understand the underwriter's logic.  We tried elevating it to her superior, and they took her side.

The seller will barely be breaking even on what they owe at the current sale price.  If they drop it any further, they will be paying out of pocket.

(Southern California),16,4,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/13vz7o/interested_in_a_foreclosed_house_with_a_fat_tax/,"Hey guys, I figured this may be the best place to ask this question :).  My boyfriend and I were looking at houses about 6 months ago, since he is in the market to buy finally.  While en route to drive by some properties, we drove past one that had not been listed.  It was everything we had ever wanted.  It was unoccupied, so we walked the property.  Gorgeous!

So the problem is, we did a lot of research on the property and found that it was the former property of a television star.  The home was a short sale at the time, and had dropped about $100k every month for 2 years.  The price was still pretty steep even as it was in a short sale, considering the condition of the home.  (I'm guessing it needs about $400k in work to be honest).  

The kicker, is that the home has an *astronomical* tax lien attached to it.  We watched the home, and found that it went into foreclosure.  The bank lowered the price by another $200k.  They obviously want to sell it, but who in their right mind would buy a house with a tax lien that is 10x the amount of money the house is worth? Our agent told us that 3 people offered the amount of money my boyfriend was going to offer, and the bank rejected it since they wanted to hold out for more, but now the bank is lowering their price again.

So my question is, what realistically can be done about this lien situation?  I can't imagine anyone who has the money to throw around would want to spend it on this house, and anyone who (like us) could barely qualify for a loan for this type of property, would be able to afford the lien on top of it.  So how exactly does this work?  I am also not aware what kind of tax lien it is.

-Leaning towards a condo because I don't know much about general upkeep/fixing etc.  I figure a condo is less work the homeowner has to do.  I also travel quite a bit so at some point I may have to factor in a management company. I have read warnings about HOA fees though.  Also, condos are gonna keep it cheaper.  If I went for a house, it would either be much more expensive or much further away from the city.  I figure the closer to the city, the easier it will be to keep renters.

-Trying to get something in an up and coming neighborhood.  There's a handful of areas in DC that are gentrifying and are not the same dangerous areas they were several years ago.

-Planning on putting 20% down.  No credit issues.  I've been messing around with the mortgage calculators a bit to get an idea of how much I would have to rent it out for.  I have been using 4% interest rate for a 30 year mortgage.  Also factoring in HOA dues as well as yearly tax.  Anything else I am forgetting about?

-Whats the general rule to determine what price range you should be looking at?

He countered with $82K, we accepted. Received our certificate of eligibility today with a total funding amount of $108,684.

We have a scheduled inspection for Sunday morning if it works with the current owner. Then we also have to schedule a termite inspection. We have to complete a home buyer's education course since we are first time buyers. We have a closing date set for 9/21.

Anyway, things seem to be going smoothly and that seems too good to be true. We don't expect them to find issues with the house. There was nothing apparent when we looked at the house. It was built in 1990 and was well care for. Only reason the guy is selling is he is an older gentleman and his wife died not long ago.

It can't be this easy, can it? I am missing something? And how does them covering closing costs work exactly? We are paying out of pocket for the home inspection. We wrote an earnest check for $350 that is supposed to go towards closing I think I was told.

UPDATE: Inspection went really well. Just some minor small fixes really. Seal some small cracks in the siding on one side of the house, rewire the light above the garage door, install GFCI outlets on the outside of the house, outlet cover for where the garage door opener plugs in, secure romex wiring in some areas in the basement, spindles for the stairs leading down to the basement, just new smoke detectors and install a  CO detector (he always recommends that), have an HVAC tech check the burn chamber as gas was smelled around it (Plan to have the sellers do that- furnace was new as of 2011) and to have the sump pump checked because it drains slow- there is a brand new one already there to be put in if needed. My uncle is a plumber and I plan to just have him check the current one for an obstruction before replacing it altogether.

I just want to let people know how this works because so many search a lot of different sites for properties or think there are sites that have more or a different list of properties.

All listing start out from root local MLS boards, yes there a are MLS boards spread out throughout the US for example here in Southern California we have many local MLS systems (list below).  So when a agent gets a listing they take photo's and collect all the property details then enters the information into the their local MLS system.  Also note when agents enter the the listing into the MLS there is a check box “to syndicate or not to syndicate” this gives permission for all the real estate sites like Zillow, Trulia, Homes.com, etc to grab the listing data.  To prove this any listing you see anywhere on the web will have the original listing agents name and company somewhere in small print.

Then what happens through a IDX system the listings from all the root local MLS boards are fed to a central database then to all the other websites usually with a day or two delay.

So if you're serious about looking for a property here's how you get a head of all the other buyers looking at old data.  Google or ask your agent for the local MLS website this data is real time and generally has consumer access.  Real time is important because lets say if a  property is listed today you can see it on the local MLS boards site today otherwise real estate portals it could be days.  

The very best thing to do is ask your agent to set you up on alerts based on your search criteria.  This makes searching properties effortless and you get a email soon as a property that meets your criteria hits the market. Also with the root mls there are more search options to fine tune what your looking for.

And by the way all banks list their properties in local MLS systems so if your looking for that “secret bank owned property list no one knows about” there isn't one. Banks want to get the highest and best price and they only way they can do this is the MLS system.

Oh also no ads or obnoxious marketing on the local MLS systems either.

1325860514.0,12,self.RealEstate,o5fuz,Some of what I know about lead generating in Real Estate,14,2,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/o5fuz/some_of_what_i_know_about_lead_generating_in_real/,"I’ve been asked by a few Redditors to comment further on ‘lead generating’, and what exactly it is from my perspective.
First off, I’ll reiterate my previous sentiments that my lead generating time is as important, if not more so, than my listing appointments. The reason is that without lead gen time, I will have no listings, and, “He who lists, lasts.” It’s that simple. 

So what is lead generating? Lead generating is the process of contacting people to try and get new business going. It can mean contacting people that are either in your database currently, or contacting people you haven’t met in order to feed and grow your database. This is done through a variety of methods, including contacting For Sale By Owners (FSBOs), expired listings (those that were listed, and the listing period ended with resulting in a sale), calling on people in your database and asking who they know that is thinking about buying, selling, or investing that you can call, going to garage sales and talking to the owners, etc. There are endless ways to lead generate. I have yet to come across a real estate company that provides its agents with a list of leads to call daily, mainly because there just aren’t that many leads that fall into brokerage’s laps. There are plenty of people that want to buy and sell; you just have to be able to find them on your own.

One more very bold way of lead generating is (get ready for this one) calling the agent who has the expired listing and offering them a 26.2% referral fee if they’ll send that seller over to you. Many listings that expire can become much harder to work on, and this way, the original agent only has to sit back and relax while you go out and list and sell the house. Then they get 26.2%. Why 26.2%? Because it’s a pattern interrupt. When you’re talking to the original listing agent on the phone, you want to *really* capture their attention to keep them from rejecting you and not listening. When you say 26.2, they’ll silently wonder why.

When calling expired listings, you have to keep in mind a few things: First, these are people who *want* to sell their house, but it just didn’t sell for some reason the first time they had it on the market. You have to call them and see when they plan to hire the right agent for the job to sell their house. Make an appointment with them where you can just take 15 minutes of their time to show them what you do to get houses sold. At that point, you can get in the door and get the listing. The second thing to remember (and you really need to tell yourself this over and over before you start calling) is “They’re home, they’re happy, and they want me to call.” It’s true. And if you don’t call, your competition will. Who do you want to have the listing? You, or your competition?

FSBOs are also a great source of leads. Many FSBOs are willing to pay a buyer’s agent a commission to bring a buyer; they just don’t want to pay a listing agent and a buyer’s agent. If you can convince them to pay just a little bit more commission to hire you, you’re in the door. YOU DON’T WANT TO CONVINCE THEM ON THE PHONE. When on the phone, all you want to do is set the appointment. The way to do this is to ask what they are doing to market the house. Offer to meet up with them to show what you do to get houses sold, because they may be able to use some of your techniques to help themselves. “I could come by tonight at 3, or would 6 be better?”

FSBOs want to sell, but they also want to buy. Find out where they are moving. If they are moving in the area, you can help them. If they are moving out of the area, you can refer them to another agent. 

When calling people to add to your database, you should be making a minimum of 20 contacts per day. A contact is defined as talking to a decision maker in a household or business. It doesn’t mean leaving a voicemail, or talking to a child. 

The Yellow Pages are another great source of leads. Open the YP and find a few businesses. Call them, ask for the owner. After you introduce yourself, tell them that you like to do business with people in the local community, and you’d like to stop by and meet them face to face. At that point, you can get their business cards, and give them a few of yours. Chances are good that someone in the business will have some real estate need, or they know someone who does. 

So what’s all this about putting your leads into a database? You do this because for every 12 people you have in your MET database (that’s people you’ve met face to face at least once) you can expect at least one transaction per year. 144 contacts should work out to 12 transactions. For every 50 people you have in your UNMET database (this is people who you have in your database for when you do mail outs to a subdivision or people who you are friends with on Facebook, but have not yet met, etc.) you can expect one transaction. CAN is the key word here. It requires action on your part in the manner of actively contacting the people in your database. You should be contacting them at least 2-3 times a month, in a rotation of email, phone call, personal visit, post card in the mail, and otherwise. You want to convert your unmet people to mets, so get our and meet folks. You want to keep in front of all of these people so that when they think real estate, the first thing they think of is YOU. Think about it, when you think of beer, or a car maker, or a place to eat a hamburger, chances are you have a brand name that pops in mind right away too. Why? Because they stay in front of you.

Those are the very basics of lead generation. It’s the most vital part of this business, so be sure you do it EVERY DAY!

If you have other questions, please ask!

According to him the mortgage payments would be comparable/less than what renting would be. So Any money I put in/ any rent we would collect could go into a mortgage.
1. Would that really be accurate? Would a mortgage in an apartment be similar to a mortgage?
2. I don't have money saved up. Is it even possible for me to get a loan with no money down?
3. If so, what can I expect in terms of out of pocket expenses (like closing costs)?
4. I don't quite know what I can afford. If it is even a possibility.
 I don't want to factor in roommates into a mortgage payment (but I will be rooming) 
5. In terms of income I am a paralegal and I bring in about $4,700 before taxes and around $3,100 after taxes. My monthly expenses are about $1,200 with my current rent and bills. 
6. I would prefer to look at foreclose homes or bank owned ones. What resources are available in order to do so? I am looking in The Los Angeles/ Pasadena area. 
7. With all of this information is it even feasible/reasonable to even think this is an option?

About five years ago, a friend and I loaned most of our savings ~$130k together in another friend's property rental business. I'll refer to this businessman friend as ""John"". I knew John for 10 years, and trusted him enough not to get a solid contract on my loan. Instead, we signed simple promissory notes. John essentially became a slumlord and purchased four cheap properties which he rented out. One property has a bank mortgage, and three were bought completely with our money.


Things went well for a few years, before he started missing monthly payments to us. The excuses and bullshit followed. Then we realized he wasn't paying taxes and utilities on the properties. He married a mail-order-bride, and completely shut us out of his personal life. One of the loans ($10k) was due after two years in full. He failed to pay this, and after a while we finally decided to call in our promissory notes (which led to suing him since he told us to fuck off). The lawsuit process took 18 months, and we finally got a court date. The entire time he played hardball, telling us he was ""judgement proof"" and would bankrupt himself before paying us a penny. Finally, he ran out of money fighting us and saw the court date coming, so he settled and signed a far better contract, secured with mortgages on his rental properties. It also had a confession of judgement built in. So we then had primary mortgages on three of the properties. After the settlement, John paid us for about 6 months. He then stopped paying, and stopped communicating completely.


After 2-4 more months, we decided to get the confession of judgement on all our contracts. After making this decision, we found out he had just moved halfway across the country. After talking to his tenants, we realized it was much uglier than we imagined... He had burned bridges with everyone imaginable; Police, fire dept, local govt officials, lawyers, tenants, etc. EVERYONE seemed to want this guy's head on a platter. He foreclosed on his house (~$250k) and it's now deserted. He hasn't paid taxes and utilities on the properties for years in some cases. Essentially he was collecting the rent, buying nice cars and living it up with his foreign wife, and not paying for any expenses. Half of his tenants are about to get kicked out of his properties due to various fire code violations and delinquent utility bills. We've spent over $20k on legal expenses so far, and the situation has been a nightmare in our lives. Almost daily I search court records and Google, and almost daily I find more ridiculous bullshit that this guy has pulled. He's completely screwed over everyone in his path, before running 2000 miles away.


After talking to our lawyer today, he suggested that we sell the mortgages/contracts to ""debt buyers"" or something like that. I don't know anything about this and would appreciate any help... The properties have taxes to the effect of probably ~$20k at this point, with an unknown amount of utility expenses and repairs that were not paid for. Our other option is foreclosing on the properties, but the lawyer thinks it's a terrible idea, because it will take forever. He thinks we should cut our losses and sell the mortgages, and write off the unpaid balance. Of course tracking John down is also a priority, so that we can actually serve him legal documents regarding actions.

Looking to buy a house - found an amazingly big distressed home.  The family living there is crazy (literally) the house is a mess.  Structurally it's fine however - and at 3,100 sq.ft. it's big!  Plenty big for our family.

We've had it inspected, we know everything wrong with it.  It will be mostly gutted and rebuilt how we want it.

The woman owes $88k to the bank, our bid sits at $75k currently (per the advise of our and the sellers lawyer as it's a short sale).  We're 90% of the way done with things and it looks as if our offer will probably be accepted.  Hard part is that the woman went to jail and is now in rehab for a year; but she has signed over power of attorney and all the paperwork to sell the house and has agreed to sell it at our asking price.  Just up to the bank now.

**CURRENT:**

Found out this past week that the father of the family who is still living there committed suicide in the home (gun to the face) 2.5 years ago.

I think for the money, we give it a shot.  All the other houses in the area are $200k and up - but they're all much better shape as well and already hooked up to city sewer (the septic is bad on this home and getting hooked up to city would have to be done in order to purchase the home).

This may get down voted to hell, but I have a legitimate question and would appreciate serious answers. I have been trying to sell my (very nicely remodeled) condo for about 1.5 years. I owe 88K on the loan. Similar units in the development are selling for between 70-80K. I recently got an offer for 72k. I can't afford a nearly $20k loss (including realtor fees), so I countered at 85k and the offer fell through. This was my only offer in over 18 months. I am considering voluntarily walking away from my condo. I don't want to ""wait it out"", because the development's condo board is severely mismanaging things and I fear that property values will continue to drop. 

I've tried to talk about a short sale or deed in lieu of foreclosure with my mortgage company, but they won't consider it due to the fact that I still have a good job and my circumstances haven't changed. 

So, if I just stop paying my mortgage, what can I expect to happen? I know the obvious: I will ruin my credit. However, I have a place to live. My fiance owns a home and we plan to live there after the wedding.

Our sales price was 143,500 the appraisal price was 144,000. The home inspection turned up with home needing a new roof, parapet repair and stucco repair that could all result in severe internal home damage (luckily we live in a desert and have been in a drought...). There were quite a few other issues brought up but they are things that we are willing to take care of (as we can)... as long as these three things (for structural integrity) are repaired. The cost for these things came in at roughly $15,000 total. The house is really old, the owners passed away almost a year ago and the home is being sold out of state by their children. Originally, the sellers agreed to about 12,000 in repairs but the TOTAL cost of all the repairs on the property (including what we're taking care of) is around 30,000. We resubmitted for the $15,000 in repairs simply because we're not paying for a house that needs 30,000 in repairs, we're paying market value. The sellers are now stating the repairs aren't needed at all because the appraisal states that ""there are no physical deficiencies or adverse conditions that affect the livability, soundness, or structural integrity of the property"".... even though the inspection stated something completely different... how should we approach this?

I know they say not to fall in love (which we have), but we're in a pretty fast market, there's not much inventory and houses are selling within days. We've been on the house hunt for over 9 months and houses have been grabbed up under us. We're also looking at paying thousands more on our mortgage just because we were able to lock a great rate and they've already gone up... so we'd REALLY like to make this work, but we're spending our ""repair money"" on the rest of the repairs the house needs besides the roof, parapets and stucco... Bleh. I'm not good at this home buying thing, so I just need some direction. We will walk if we need to, but we REALLY REALLY REALLY don't want to.

***EDIT FOR UPDATE***
... in a surprising twist, they've decided to make all requested repairs (roughly $15,000). After a few extensions from them... I think they decided they were tired of dealing with the house.

1364328194.0,10,self.RealEstate,1b28w0,We're selling and just signed listing paperwork with our agent.  He mentioned that he has a buyer for a possible pre-market sale.  Now we have questions!,11,1,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/1b28w0/were_selling_and_just_signed_listing_paperwork/,"We've done a ton of work to our house, and its value is on the high end for our neighborhood.  It's an early 1900s two-story that has been almost completely modernized--new kitchen, all new plumbing and electrical, laundry on the upper level with the bedrooms, etc.  And it's all freshly painted and mostly staged.

We just met with our our agent to sign the contract and listing paperwork.  He's been amazingly helpful over the last two months, keeping up on our work, suggesting small improvements/changes to do before listing, etc.  Anyway, after taking a final tour after our latest round of painting and staging, he asked if we would consider a pre-market sale.  He has been working with a buyer, and apparently our house ticks pretty much every checkbox on this buyer's list.

We hadn't even considered that this could happen.  Our agent was very up-front with the breakdown on the seller's fees (7%, a little higher than some, but part of this is due to his marketing--we've seen it in action, and he goes far beyond what anyone else is doing in our area).  Anyway, the tricky part is that a pre-market sale puts him in disclosed dual-agency, and kind of negates his marketing justification.  Is this a situation where fees would/could/should be renegotiated?

This is our first home, and thus our first sale.  So I'm hoping someone here could give us some pointers/advice on what needs to happen on a pre-market sale, if it's even a good idea, etc.

We're not really sure how to proceed.  The current projected selling range just barely gets us out of our mortgage.  We could offer it for sale, price non-negotiable, close to the top of our reasonable range.  A pre-market sale is somewhat charming... it would be nice not to worry about always having it ready for showing, dealing with open houses, etc.

But there's always the possibility that we'd be missing out on a potential bidding war.  I'm not sure how likely this is, but our agent says he hasn't seen the pool of available houses as low as it is now in almost ten years. He's also says he hasn't seen as many active buyers hitting open houses in our neighborhood as he is seeing now.  So it seems to be a hot market.

Anyway, we'd love to hear any of your thoughts or advice.

1363630184.0,12,self.RealEstate,1ajcg9,What is a good long-term strategy for transitioning into real estate? How many years before I can quit my job and be a full-time landlord?,16,4,51,http://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/1ajcg9/what_is_a_good_longterm_strategy_for/,"I work a full-time job right now but I would like to start transitioning into real estate as a small landlord. I'm looking at buying a duplex right now to live in and collect rent, which I have heard is the way many people get into real estate. I am going the FHA route with 3.5% down, possibly a 203k.

I'm wondering what the long-term strategy would be. **Let's say my end goal is to own 5 duplexes.** When should I start looking for property #2 after aquiring property #1? Is the 3.5% down payment only for first-time home buyers or could I do that for all of the properties?

How will I finance each property? Will I be getting a 2nd mortgage in my own name? What about the 3rd? Can you get 5 mortgages for 5 duplexes with an average salary, considering the rental income? Do I have to start an LLC for each property, as I've heard other people have done? 

My end goal is to be a landlord full-time and leave my current job. Depending on how much free time I have, I would be fine working a part-time job, but obviously would prefer to have rental income support me. Assuming each unit can get around $800-$1000 rent per month (average in my area for 1-2 br) with 5 duplexes that would be $8000-$10000/month gross income. 

I'm not sure what the average vacancy rate is but even at 10% vacancy that would be $7200-$9000/month gross, way more than my current monthly gross of $3500. I don't know how the taxes would affect the actual net income but I'm pretty sure I could comfortably live on an annual salary of $86,400. In this scenario I would be living somewhere else, maybe renting somewhere or living in a single home for myself and family to live in long-term. 

Am I dreaming here or is this actually a possibility? How many years can I expect to spend building my portfolio with a $40-$50k salary before I have 5 properties? I don't mind financing all of them, I would MUCH rather quit my full-time job earlier and have more mortgage to pay back than to continue working and saving to invest with cash. 

I value a flexible work schedule (full-time landlord) over financial savings, to an extent, if that makes sense.

my situation right now is I found a house I want, but I'm not moving until June. I can either wait and hope it is still available, or start the buying process now, and the seller agreed to immediately rent it from me until june, as he doesnt need to leave this soon. I have no problem with the buy and rent until im there. I just dont want to attempt to buy now, not get my preapproval then have an unnecessary extra credit inquiry.

Nearly all my finances current and old are through USAA since 2007/8, first mortgage, an auto loan for my car, and an older co-signed auto loan from my divorce.

Another question would be I know investment financing and primary residence financing usually have different rates. Other than waiting to buy, or sucking up the payments on an empty house, Is there anyway to avoid getting a investment property rate on a house that will only be rented 2 or 3 months before I arrive? Perhaps finance it as a primary residence and state someone will be ""house sitting"" until my arrival?

In the future I would like to invest more heavily in real estate.  My intention is to do it pretty slowly at first, and pay cash for the houses I get.  My ideal plan is to have a number of houses to generate passive income to supplement my retirement eventually, and have some stored capital should I need it for something (understanding that they aren't really 'quick cash').

My wife and I both work now, are in our early (her) and mid (me) 30's, so we have a bit of time to work on this before we really need to have the income.  My wife isn't really sold on the idea of investing in real estate, and would rather just hand it to the bank to manage.  Her main concern with real estate is the time commitment required.  To me, it seems that owning real estate that generates passive rental income, is the best way to really ensure our retirement will be waiting for us, and would be a great supplement to our other retirement funds.

The thing I've wondered about is how useful or important is it to have a property management service?  Is it something we should do at first while learning the ropes? What is the typical cost of a management service? Are the services worth it?  What are some things to watch out for when using a service like this?  Any other advice or input that can be given about a property management service would be greatly appreciated.

A little background first. I am a single male, late 20s, living in Texas. I have a well paying job for the area, moderately low expenses, and have managed to save up about $40k. I live in city of about 100,000 people. The city is home to 3 colleges/universities that together enroll about 20,000 or more students.

I've read a few books about rental properties and most seem to agree that buying a 4plex and renting out 3 units while living in 1 is a good idea. The problem is that there are very few 4plexes on the market, and of those available, most are old (built in 30s - 60s) and require many repairs. There a few duplexes that appear to be in decent condition, but I am really liking the idea of a 4plex.

I've looked around and have found quite a few lots going for $20k - $30k in areas that are near the universities. I realize that some lots may not be zoned for 4plexes or that the community in a particular area might frown upon one, but assuming that a particular lot checks out would be it viable to buy a lot and build my own 4plex on it? Would it be better to bite the bullet on one of the older ones and pay for repairs?

If building is a good idea, what challenges might I face that I normally wouldn't?

I want to buy a specific open plot of undeveloped land which neighbors a property I own in rural New York.

Some facts:

- I know who the owners are and I have their contact information; including a phone number.
- I don't know them personally; we've never met.
- I do know someone who knows the owners. He told me he tried to buy the land from the owners ten years ago for what sounded like an insultingly low offer, which was rejected.
- According to my contact, the owners have owned the land for twenty years or so. They planned to build on it, but never got around to it.
- According to my contact, they would probably entertain an offer for their land due to recent changes in their financial situation.

Some questions:

1. I want to cold call the owners and make an unsolicited offer for the land. I don't want to pay too much, but I don't want to offend them like the last person did either. How do I do that?

2. How do I determine what a fair offer is? My gut instinct tells me it's probably worth a lot more than $10k and a lot less than $100k but I don't know how to determine that.

3. I most likely won't be able to afford to buy it outright, but I could easily afford to make payments on it over a five year term or so. Do I take out a second mortgage or go with a land contract? Or something else?

We had our first offer today and It's a little sketchy. I'm hoping someone can give me some input as to what the scam (if any) could be in this situation. The details:
- Buyers agent has told us that the buyer is a church leader and the church is paying cash for the house. However, they cash is in a trust and won't be available until February. The buyers would like to be in the house by the end of the month so would like to rent back the house until the cash is available and they can close. 
- Buyers agent sent us a letter from the church secretary on church letterhead stating their intent to pay for the house with church funds. I did some basic googling including searching facebook for any information on the church secretary and/or the buyer. I found the buyers facebook page (wide open, not restricted). It looks like the church secretary is his daughter or possibly step daughter. The church does not seem very legit since the address of the church is a house. My real estate agent inquired about this and they said that the church is temporarily meeting at their home.
- After some additional searching it appears the buyer may be high up in a pyramid scheme type company. This could explain where the money is coming from. He could be using the church as a tax shelter. 

Here's the big red flags for me: 
- Paying $250k cash for a house. The church does not seem legit so it's doubtful they have a trust. Why is the money taking until February to become available. 
- Whats the rush to move in. Why rent back for a month and half. 

My real estate agent has requested proper documentation of the funds. At this point I'm pretty sure I won't be entertaining the offer but I'm curious what the scam here might be. Anyone have any ideas?

EDIT: Thanks everyone for the awesome advice. I really appreciate the feedback. I'll try to post an update once I get more details about the funds.

EDIT2: Thank you all for the excellent advice. As I expected, no actual proof of funds have been provided and the buyers agent is giving my agent the run around.

New game plan, please advise and don't be gentle on my rental property/foreclosure investment plan.",12,1,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/11t7cr/not_quite_a_newbie_but_not_quite_seasoned_either/,"Hi all, I am a 26 year old male that has gotten his feet wet with rental property and foreclosure flipping over the last three years. For my day job I manage the Personal Training Dept. at my local Gold's Gym.

I've always been interested in real estate investing, my father invested in rental property and I learned bits and pieces from him over the year.

I ended up writing out a much longer post, but seeing how ridiculously long it was I deleted it and now this is the shorthand version, believe it or not.

My situation:
1. Parent's divorced in 2008, mom was disabled(she and I have a auto-immune disease called Ankylosing Spondylitis, that effects joints and can ultimately fuse your spine completely) and I lived with her to assist her.
2. On 4.3.09 I find my mother deceased in her bedroom after I went upstairs to ask her what she'd like for breakfast, I was and still am heartbroken. There's a void inside me that can never be filled.
3. After a battle with the executor(my uncle, who wanted to toss me out on my ass literally the next week) my brother(10 years old than I) produced a legitimate will that declared he and I were to be our mother's sole beneficiaries.

That's the beginning of my story. From my mother's estate I received a sizable sum, along with 2 rental properties with 15 years mortgages(one of which was underwater).

I contacted my Father, and told him I didn't want to screw this up, and I asked him what his advice was, he recommended an old associate of his to manage my new properties for him. This is where I met Ken, my current property manager; he's an awesome guy. He's not cheap, he charges me 15% of the rent each month for each unit, and any other work he does is at a flat rate of  $45 an hour, he's qualified and capable of doing any and everything except for electrical work and heating &amp; air, he's been a lifesaver even though I know he does charge more than usual for property managers. 

My father also introduced me to another investor friend of his Kyle. Kyle and his partner Tony collectively own over 70 rental units with their company, however since the real estate bubble burst he and Tony have been focusing on foreclosure investing. Kyle helped me get a rental property in another county for a great deal at the time, 36.5k for a 5 bed, 3.5 bath home along with my own residence now(4 bed 3 bath on 5 acres)

Fast forward two years, and I've invested with Kyle and Tony on several foreclosure flips, each one has been profitable for me and them. The rental property Kyle helped me get though has proven difficult to keep quality tenants in, and now I think I'm ready to sell since I'll avoid short term capital gains tax. 

So here's what's been rattling around up in my head. Ken my property manager has 6 units, and he's 59 years old. He'd like to, 'get out of the game' so to speak within the next few years, and wants to sell all his units at one time, and asked me if I would be interested in buying him out down the road. He has 2 duplex's and 2 single family homes for the total of 6 units overall. After expenses his cash flow is $3,900 a month. I've seen his books to verify this. I currently have 60k in the bank, but I also have the rental property paid for that has been a real pain to keep rented.

So what I'd like to do, is sell my paid off rental, for around 50k(comps in area are up to 65k but I don't want to have to wait for another 6 months to sell) and use my $$$ to get back into foreclosure investing with Kyle and Tony. I averaged 10-15k returns on each deal with Kyle, and depending on the nature that could take anywhere between 3-6 months to complete a deal. So I've still got great deductions with the two units I still have with mortgages(15 years) and my own personal home with a 30 year mortgage, plus Ken's fee and the work he does on them for me. My long term goal is to build up a large amount of cash, which I can then use to purchase all 6 of ken's units outright from him and also continue to invest in the foreclosure with Kyle's company at the same time. I've come to realize I can make boat loads more money with Kyle, but the problem is the taxes, which is why I want to keep the two units I have with mortgages and my own personal house, for the tax deductions, and eventually acquire Ken's units for more cashflow a month but also more deductions as well.

I am not really interested in stocks/commodities as I tried my hand and got burned badly. I am interested in creating an LLC to put my existing units under and possibly another LLC to do the foreclosures with Kyle. 

I'm asking for your thoughts on my overall strategy, and any constructive criticism that you may have for me. I have done well so far, but I feel this new strategy will allow me to get the $$$ I need to really expand my rental business for deductions + cashflow and continue to invest in foreclosures for overall $$$.",,False,,t5_2qipl,False,,,True,t3_11t7cr,http://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/11t7cr/not_quite_a_newbie_but_not_quite_seasoned_either/,

9/4/12 Submitted offer on fixer upper. Asking price was $320k, we offered $315k. Estimate $80k in renovations. We create our wishlist, and price it out with home depot for materials and labor. This is when you want to interview HUD consultants to see who you want to work with. Go to the HUD site to see who is in your area, then YELP them. Once you figure out your consultant, ask them for a list of lenders they have worked with, as well as general contractors they have worked with. Getting a good team together is critical to having this move along smoothly.

9/7/12 offer accepted. Shit gets real. Schedule inspection with your HUD consultant, start shopping for FHA 203k loans from the list that your consultant provided. Factors include rates, fees, and how quickly they can close.

9/11/12 Initial inspection done by HUD consultant. He will provide a health and safety list that MUST be fixed with your 203k loan. This list will be merged with your wishlist. Most of your wishlist should overlap with this one. This is also where the showstoppers might occur. Cracked slab, messed up plumbing, etc, this is the point of no return. If you stop now, you'll be out time, and your inspection costs.

9/12/11 Meet General Contractors at property so that they can provide bid. You should have the health and safety report, as well as the requested renovation changes to provide to them. Go over each item as you walk through the house. They will provide input, and point out other things that need to be fixed/were missed on inspection.

9/16/12 First bid received and reviewed. $92k in costs :X A lot of items were missing/too much so we asked them to modify to bring it in line. 
9/17/12 Loan submitted with first bid numbers. Rate is locked at 3.5% and they're giving me .5% back in credit!

9/17/12 Second bid reviewed, and changes have been requested. This guy was a lot more realistic and had his numbers at $75k

9/18/12 First bid finalized, end price is $85k. He was a personable guy, but he is charging 10% for profit, and 10% for overhead, and won't really work with us to reduce price. Who charges $15/sq ft to install tile? $6/sq ft to install laminate? Ridiculous!

Waiting on all 3 bids to be reviewed and finalized before I can select a contractor. Once contractor is selected, HUD Consultant will create a work write up, submit to lender. Lender will then schedule appraisal.

Also asking seller to reduce selling price since there were a few big issues that popped up. All HVAC ducting was removed, furnace is dead, and plumbing is compromised.

I am a Realtor. 

I recently purchased a foreclosed triplex. The building was originally a SFR, 1920's built, 1.75 story home (unit 1). Sometime in the early 1980's there were two units attached to the back of the home in up/down fashion. Down is unit 2 and Up is unit 3.   

We are in the process of some extensive remodeling due to some water damage. I called the city in (per their request) to take a look at it before we started putting it back together. 

Today, at the inspection, the inspector I talked to on the phone was there along with his boss. After walking through the first unit the boss tells me that he was there too because he needed to tell me that this house is zoned as a Duplex and must be converted 'back'. 

I explained to him that I called the city (in fact I even talked to the inspector at one point) and asked several people prior to purchasing the building if it was going to be a problem to remain as a 3 unit. Everyone told me it was fine. 

However, he said that it 'was' being used as a triplex and 'was' grandfathered in but since it became vacant, they no longer consider it grandfathered and I need to turn it back. 

I asked if I could get a variance and he said 'maybe'. The girl I need to talk to is out of town right now but I have plans to meet with her on Monday morning. 

It is in a fairly small town and the inspectors were pretty nice guys so I'm crossing my fingers I can get that variance... 

Some additional info that is important. It has 3 gas, water, and electric meters. It has 3 HVAC systems. It was never a duplex and will be nearly impossible to convert to a 2 unit property. Across the street is a 4-plex. One block away are two 30+ unit apartment buildings. 

Any suggestions or advice how I should handle this going forward?

The week before Tenant B is supposed to take over the house, Tenant B comes to visit the house while Tenant A is moving out, sees that it is a mess (as in, boxes everywhere, due to Tenant A moving), and complains that it is too messy. I promise that it will be cleaned up by the time Tenant B's lease starts, but then Tenant B demands that I re-paint the interior and replace the carpets. 

This was never promised by us, or in the lease that Tenant B signed, so when I refused, he wanted to no longer live there, and aggressively demanded a full refund of his 1st month's lease and security deposit.

What can I do? Do I have a right to withhold the security deposit for lost time, since Tenant B signing the lease caused me to stop looking for Tenant A's replacement? How much can I withhold? All of it? Some percentage? Should I be concerned that he will take me to small claims court to get his deposit back? Any help and advice is appreciated!

Closed today on the first house I've bought in a while.  It was in a good area not too far from where I live.  By the numbers: Purchase price: $85K.  Repair estimate( for rental): $5-7K.  ARV: $135-140K.  So, all in at 65-68% ARV.  Nothing has rented in the subdivision in the last year for under $1400.

For those who have said you can't make money wholesaling, etc., the wholesaler that sold it to me made a $24K fee.

Also, technically the house is zoned as a condo; a large lot was split into three lots, each with a house on it.  The driveway is shared, but the houses are not close to each other and they're three properties.  Does this affect the value of the house?

She is a member of the Shawnee Tribe and may be eligible for a special FHA loan that would not require PMI to be paid at all, even with a smaller down payment.  She has also been the victim of credit fraud in the past, and as a result has not-so-stellar credit.

SCENARIO 1

- 3.75% Interest, only myself on the loan so we would be paying PMI ($130/Month) and paying the minimum mortgage payment ($930) for at least the first 6 months to year before beginning to overpay by another $100 or so each month.

SCENARIO 2

- 4.5% Interest, both of us on the loan so no PMI (leaving a payment of about $800).  We would still pay about $930 every month with excess going entirely to principle, then after 6 months to a year begin overpaying another $100 or so each month.


I hate the idea of paying PMI (almost as much as I hate throwing money away by renting) and am desperate to get out of it, BUT we just simply can't swing enough of a down payment at the moment to avoid an FHA-style loan.  Any advice?

http://www.flickr.com/photos/erocsid/sets/72157629470077587/

Brand new townhouse, 4 levels, 1392ft^2 (and not an inch unusable), 2 bed, 1.5 bath (2x3/4, no tubs), main bedroom loft, rooftop deck, radiant heat, 77 walk score, 0.6 miles from the new light rail. It is a perfect mix of affordability, what I want in a unit, and location. I'm buying it to live there for 7-10 years or so, and then selling it or possibly renting it and checking out the east coast. I am not banking on it being worth significantly more than what I paid for it when the time comes. Really, we'd stay renting if the rental market wasn't getting so gouge-y and we weren't sick of moving every 2 years or so.

My SO and I had been out with Redfin (can't say enough nice things about Redfin!) three times to look at places over fall/winter and decided to wait until summer because we weren't super impressed. We agreed to not even bother looking until the summer but one morning she said ""Okay, just look at this one place,"" and IM'ed me a listing that I rolled my eyes at initially. It looked too good to be true.

It was a brand new, 8-unit townhouse development in an as-good-as-it-gets location and had been on the market for 3 days. There was an open house scheduled for Sunday, but she got us in with our realtor on Saturday and we looked at every unit. About 10 other groups of people came through during the couple hours we spent there checking out all the units, but only 1 had a realtor with them and was doing tours like us.

5 days after being listed, 3 of the units were already under contract. I had the one we wanted inspected and the inspector thanked me for making his life so easy -- the place was perfect. ""They are building these to sell them, I haven't seen a place this clean in a while,"" he said. He pointed out commercial quality materials, extra wall widths, new styles of construction, and couldn't find any cut corners. We went back to the seller with 15 nit-picky little items and they agreed to do every single one of them.

Within 48 hours I put an offer in. All 8 were under contract within 30 days and 3 have already closed as far as I know.

It was an interesting experience that started out with me getting pre-approved by BoA -- a horrible decision in hind-sight. I wanted my financing to be unrelated to my realtors and I wanted to have it together before even looking at our first unit. Unfortunately, my SO is bad at money (thankfully she makes enough to afford it) and can not be involved with the loan itself, so it was all on my income and credit. She paid the rent as I hoarded cash for closing and downpayment though! Anyway, I got pre-approved and I figured we'd just go around to places listed above the pre-approved amount, lowballing them at what the bank will give me, and see if we got lucky.

We had seen a few units we were interested in but they were not ones that were going to come down in price -- about 10-20% too expensive -- and in sort of shitty locations.

Then this unit came along listed at exactly what I was pre-approved for and we made the offer. Our realtor expected the seller to allow a bidding war to happen, but the offer (for $5 over asking to make it a nice round number) was immediately accepted. I was able to put 20% down and did $10k in earnest as opposed to the typical $5k to show I was serious. This probably helped me when I eventually had to extend the closing date after BoA fucked everything up.

21 days into the process -- 10 days before closing -- I got a call from my loan officer at BoA saying, ""This property is zoned as commercial, Fannie Mae won't underwrite it, we can't do a residential loan, our hands are tied, sorry."" My realtor immediately got title involved and showed them it was zoned mixed-use, and after BoA continued to try to blame government regulations, they finally admitted it was a BoA policy preventing them from doing the loan. They consider the specific type of zoning ""high-risk"" (and Chase told me they wouldn't do it either, but they took about 24 hours to decide that, not 21 days).

I consider this a major fuck up on BoA's part because they should not have allowed 21 days to pass before looking at basic information about the property like how it is zoned and if they fund mortgages zoned like that (not to mention incorrectly blaming the government for being unable to do the mortgage). And, again, Chase took 24 hours to review the place and came back with a ""no"" (based solely on zoning) right away, so fuck BoA's lack of diligence. But it doesn't matter now and I'm beyond over it.

This is all because the street-facing unit has the lower level dedicated to a small office that opens to the street. My unit (and the other 6) are 100% residential. But this doesn't matter because the entire lot is zoned as mixed-use to allow for the 1 unit to be mixed use. It seems pretty stupid in my mostly clueless opinion (I'm a computer nerd, not a finance or real estate person).

My realtor immediately set me up with a Redfin preferred lender -- Sterling Savings -- but the closing costs were much higher than BoA's estimates, so I had some sticker shock, kinda felt like I was getting fucked a little, and told Sterling to hold on because I need to get more bids. I spent a frantic 48 hours getting 3 more bids that were all not significantly different from what Sterling was offering me so I called them back and said let's do it.

With a new lender in place, my realtor got the closing date extended (and kept the financial contingency on the earnest money; if the seller would have forced us to drop it and put my earnest money at risk, I would have walked away). Everything was set for take 2 and I began jumping through banking hoops.

The mortgage process is just hoop after hoop after hoop. At one point they needed a 1099-MISC from 2009 within 24 hours. I kept saying to myself: one day they will demand a single plum floating in perfume in a man's hat -- so I better keep that shit on hand.

Exactly 30 days after locking in my second try at a mortgage, I should have keys this afternoon. Honestly, part of me wants to wait to say anything until I officially hold keys -- the only time I'll believe I actually bought a house -- but as far as I know title is recording the deed with the county as I type this.

Towards the end of the process, during one of the final walk-throughs, I got to meet the main builder and the guy who owns the LLC that developed the property who just happened to be on-site. I was very happy to find they were both extremely nice people, really easy to talk to, got some interesting history about the development process and the neighborhood as they did the walk-through with me (that they didn't have to do, other people were there for that). Also, I was really glad to hear it was like their 10th project together and all of their projects sell quickly. They seemed like nice people and, slightly more importantly, really seemed like they knew what they were doing.

Goodbye Seattle rental market. To a couple who wants some space and a nice unit, you became stupidly expensive, and I'm sick of you raising my rent over and over. The rental market is at historical low vacancies around here and nice buildings like ours are starting to gouge.

I've read about hard money lending and it looks like an interesting concept and not very risky considering the returns. If I want to become a hard money lender how would that work? Is this something I can do from abroad without visiting the US too much?

My father owns a commercial property. The tenant wants to renew the lease for another 10 years. Basic info about the tenant: sends us prepaid cheques for the entire year, no trouble, polite man, pays on time. 

Here's the tricky question: for the renewal lease, the tenant is willing to assume all the payments for property tax, GST/QST sales taxes, school taxes, mortgage and insurance - all these costs are fixed costs that must be paid yearly and adds up to roughly $40K. The annual rent income will be around $60K. This is for the next upcoming 10 years. On our side, we won't have much expenses to pay since it's all consumed by the tenant and I assume my net income would be 60K-5K= 55K.

Now my father wants to add another condition ""net,net,net"" on top of the things mentioned earlier, meaning the tenant must now pay for their own major repairs and every other future costs. Obviously, the tenant is unwilling to do that now. We are still negotiating at this moment.

What would you do if you were in my place: push the tenant to accept the ""net,net,net"" condition or sign the lease anyways without that ""net,net,net"" condition?

Not sure if it is in the right place, but here goes:

In 2007, My Dad owned a house, paid in full.  He refinanced and withdrew the equity in the house during market boom and bought a nearby lot, intending to build a new house, sell the current house and close out the loan.  
Instead, market crashed and both new lot and old house were worth a fraction of the loan amount.  He couldn't afford the loan payments long term, and sought advice for loan modification and was told to stop paying mortgage. He did that and sought loan modification, but bank instead sold his house out from under him and he was foreclosed on. he moved out to a rental, but still owns the lot.

Dad has worked the same job for 25years and can easily afford the mortgage payment for a loan to build a modest house on the paid for lot.  However, because of the foreclosure, he doesn't qualify for the loan.

I own my own home in another state, but am in a position to co-sign his loan so that he could get approval to go ahead and build his house and resume the same stable life that I've known him to have for decades.

My worry is whether or not FreddieMac (who insured his original loan and paid his bank when he was foreclosed on) Can or Will come after my dad for the difference between what Dad owed, and what they collected after the sale of his house --a difference of about $150k.
If so, I'm worried that they could somehow force a sale of his new house and seize assets--leaving me holding the bag for the new mortgage i've co-signed for.

Is this fear founded?  Does anyone have any advice to help mitigate this risk, or thoughts on my options?  any advice at all is appreciated, i'm not sure what type of professional to seek advice from in the situation :)

The home is in a 100 yr flood plain. My clients are purchasing the home using FHA financing. We are having an unbelievably difficult time finding reasonable insurance rates. Being FHA the lender requires that the flood insurance be escrowed every year, the quotes we have found for insurance were originally coming back at $5,000/yr. by far the most expensive insurance rates I've ever seen. As it turns out the flood certificate done on the property does not have a base elevation for the home, because of this flood insurance rates are out of control. I've met with the surveyor who did the flood certificate who has informed me that because of the way county/city maps overlay there is no way to obtain a base elevation unless we do a $5,000 flood study, which frankly is out of the questions and out of my clients budget, and still does not guarantee that the base elevation will improve the rates. Last week the lender decided that unless we can get the insurance to $2,000/yr (flood and home owners) it throws off the debt to income ratio and we cannot continue. After much work the I've been able to obtain a few quotes for around $2,200/yr ONLY for the flood, not including the home owners. Any one have experience with a situation like this? Any ideas, tips, thoughts?

Edit: Working with a new insurance agency today, they are working on doing some creative binding for the insurance to make it work. In normal situations I would have advised my clients against working so hard to push the envelope that is the debt to income ratio, however, it is a husband and wife who are recently getting back on their feet after he lost a very well paying white collar job, this entire loan is based off of her income and short job history as a nurse, he is recently back in the work force and they both make more than enough to afford the loan, but he is not anywhere on paper due to his credit wreck after being laid off.

We had agreed to allow them to stay for another month. One of them had a lease and the other was the daughter of the previous owner with no lease, we received the deposit from the girl on the lease as well as rent for the month from both girls.  The owners daughter did not have an accompanying deposit. 

They both moved out within the month as agreed and left it in decent condition.  They both had pets and it was obvious.  In the lease we inherited it merely states that a pet would have to be discussed with the lessor, which would have been a verbal agreement with the previous owner.   They vacuumed but not very well, there was a significant amount of dog hair in the corners, the cabinets, and even clinging to the wall.  Everything was incredibly dusty as well and the carpets had pet stains.  There was other damage that included a broken hand rail on the stairs and there were spots in the floor molding, curtains, and window sill, where a dog had chewed.  There was also a light fixture that was broken.  We brought some of these things up with the previous owner when we bought the place but he told us to use the deposit to pay for the repairs.

We used the deposit to have the pet stained carpets cleaned, and also hired a company to do a deep clean to get rid of all the pet hair and dust. We fixed the other damages ourselves.  We took a total of $700 out of the deposit to cover everything and gave her the remaining $200.  We also gave her a list of repairs and prices that admittedly wasn't very descriptive.  

We recently received a letter from her disputing the charges, claiming they were ""normal wear and tear"" and quoted Texas law.  She is asking for  a descriptive itemized list along with invoiced and cancelled checks showing payment, however we did some of the work ourselves. She also claimed that the deductions should've been split between the 5 other subletters, of which we have no account of.  She's threatening to sue us in small claims court for the remaining $700.

How should I go about this? I've drafted an email explaining these things and giving more detail of each repair however I'm hesitant to send it in case she is dissatisfied and immediately contacts a lawyer.  I also realize that it is unfair to charge her for everything but I have no legal ties to any of the other lessees.

Her last lease agreement was up a little while ago and she never signed a new one even though we offered it. Department of Human Services sends a check that pays in full her rent every month. We cashed out this month's for June and will deny July's check. Since the rent is paid via county, it's never late so she owes us no late rent. 

I'm entirely new to the eviction process, but the city I'm in is Rochester. We're looking to sell the house this summer and cut our losses here. I'm wondering what terms should I go through the eviction process and what are some legalities should I know of. 


*This may or may not be a factor in evicting, but it helps describe the situation*

* She claims that my father's her boyfriend. 

* My dad's just an overall friendly dude who can be... well is a wuss and gives into peer pressure really easily. We have an entire community who can reference and attest his character. I know him better than anyone else and since he didn't grow up with a father and is a pacifist he really cannot handle confrontation. 

* Since the property is down the street from where we live, she stakes out my father and pesters him for a ride to her mom's house which is on the way to his job. Since I've came home, I've told her to back off, but I do believe he helped her with similar errands; we went to McDonalds with her once. 


* Anyways, the whole neighborhood knows this girl is crazy and she hasn't bothered us since I came home. 

* Two years ago she tried to pin a child on my dad... he took 2 DNA tests and both came back 0%.

* She tried to blackmail us by saying, ""He is I have pictures of him playing with my child and us being intimate"" and she showed me pictures of him like fixing the toilet with his shirt off and him sitting down at her table.

* Last summer the cops were called 30 times to the house. We were summoned to meet with the leader of Northeast Community Center and called for this to end or either the property would be closed. I left to college before I could oversee him evicting/closing/or fixing whatever it was with the house. 

* The original lease said no pets. She has a dog; the backyard is really unclean with shit everywhere. 

* We've had protection orders on her in the past. 

As of right now for the past month, it's been pretty quiet. No activity. No cops were called. She doesn't come banging on our door at 1AM in the morning and doesn't bother my dad during lunch. I take her phone calls directly.

They set a price higher than what they can get and people who hear about the interest rates about to go up bid up the price even higher than the high price set. 

The above has been my observation for homes listing in my city. I kind of feel alone in this. 

As an example with hypothetical numbers and features but reflecting a real life situation I'm in:

I saw a home listed for $270,000. It looked interesting, but it was not in the best neighborhood, although a few security features made the home safe. I saw a home listed right next to it for $249,000. However, that one sold just a day before I saw it and my agent did not tell me about it. I offered $250,000 for the one available listed for $270,000. The seller said they would not sell for less than $265,000. I said it is not worth more than $255,000. The seller said they will be looking for other buyers if I did not give $265,000. I said that if they want $265,000, they need to improve the property to make it worth the price, and I explained things that need to be done in the property for me to pay $265,000. They said they will look for other buyers. Well, they came back to me a few days later and offered it for $260,000. 

What should I do here? 

My agent says I should just take it because the seller has come half way. For my agent, the sale means some revenue while no sale means zero. Missing out on his cut for the $2,500-$5,000 remaining in the negotiation doesn't makes sense for him. 

However, from my perspective, it's not a good deal, even if the amounts that remains in play in negotiation are small. The original listing price of $270,000 was a cooked up price anyway. Better properties are now listing around this one for $275,000. Just because they've come down half way, it doesn't mean that the property is worth that much. It needs work to make it worth that much, which either the seller should do before selling to me or reduce the price so I can get it done.

I've been noticing a trend in southern california, where homes are coming onto the market (usually short sale), and go pending within a few hours (sometimes minutes).  They are listed at a price that is comprable to the sold homes in the area, but due to low inventory, list prices are much higher (20-30% higher).  I.e. home comes on MLS for 400k, when other homes in the area are listed at 475-500k.  Then immediately goes pending.

Shouldn't the banks know that their properties are being sold for below market price?  I'm assuming the BPO will seem acceptable since the homes sold a few months ago were around that price. 

What exactly is going on?  Are these agents/owners pulling a fast one on the banks?

I plan on allowing the tenant I’m going to rent the house to to be allowed to sublet as well.  The house is in central TX with a nice lawn. Specific things I was wondering about are is it typical to write in lawn maintenance into the rental agreement, does anyone know where I can find a good example rental agreement for TX, are there any laws I need to be aware of or know where I can look them up?  What is normal for deposits?  That current tenant will rent out the place for between 1 and 2 years then I plan on using a property management company to take over the house, does anyone have experience with these?

We recently put down an offer on a condo and have been working with a lender to close as soon as possible because the seller's agent has set a deadline to close within 40 days. 

A few days into the process I was offered a job at a new company in the same industry and city for a lot more money per year. Being that it was a huge raise and a better company, I spoke to my real estate agent (who said that it probably would not affect things if I could send my offer letter to the lender) and then gave notice to my current employer.

When I brought this up with our lender, she said that it could cause a huge delay because of the employment verification, which is problematic because the seller's agent we're working with doesn't seem to be willing to give us an extension. I guess they need to see paychecks as part of the employment verification process.

We were SO excited about this condo because we have been looking for almost a year now. Prices just kept going up or we'd get beat out by all cash offers above list price, and it was just miserable. We've also already put money into inspections, HOA docs, etc. We'd hate to see all of that go away and to start back at square one, but I'm not sure if there are any other options at this point.

It is comfortably within my budget, in the location I want to be, and is overflowing with charm, which is exactly what I'm looking for. Despite all this, the fact that it is so old is a little bit unnerving to me, especially considering it would be my first home. The interior would need a little bit of paint and minor TLC, but I know I could tackle that myself.

I've done some research and have a general idea of common problems with old houses that I should be aware of, and some of them have already been addressed by the seller. For one, all the old wiring has been hauled out and replaced with new 200 amp panel. All the old plumbing has been replaced with PEX water lines and PVC pipe. The foundation appears solid, and there is no noticeable sagging in the floors or cracking in the plaster, but I would obviously get an engineer and/or an inspector to look at it first. 

The things that are worrying me the most are:

- I don't have any information about the condition of the roof, which leads me to believe that it would likely be due to get done.

- I have no idea how much (if any) insulation is in the walls, and what the condition of it is.

- All the windows in the house are the original single pane windows. Almost all of them have fairly new storm windows on the outside, but I'm still concerned about how much heat would be lost during the winter (I live in a cold climate). What, if anything, can be done to mitigate this without having to rip everything out and replace with vinyl windows?

- The basement, while seemingly dry, has some sections of bare earth without concrete. My realtor said this is common in houses around this age, but what, if anything, should I be looking for/concerned about with this kind of basement?

I really do like this house and I could definitely see myself want to put an offer on it. Would it make more sense to have a home inspection done prior to making an offer? Also, my area is currently a buyers-market, so would going in at around 90% of asking price be appropriate?

He said I would soley benefit on the tax benefits (Write offs, mortgage interest, depreciation etc). 

Clearly, I have concerns, but dont exactly know what they could be. Is there a website/book where I can read up on best practices for this type of scenario?  Would this affect my ability to get a mortage for my own home in the future?

As such, the first house we liked in Fairfax, we put an offer for the asking price and put an escalation clause upto 15K more than asking price. We waived Lead Paint inspection (even though the house was built in 1960s) but put all other contingencies (including bank financing) in place. We lost that one; not sure to what.



Second house (Vienna), same story but with 20k more in escalation clause. We lost it again.



Third house (Vienna). We offered 15k more than the asking price and put $28k as escalation clause. We waived Lead and Radon inspection. We lost it again!! We were told the winning offer had waived all contingencies (as-is) and had a better escalation addendum. Not sure if that means higher escalation clause.

When I arrived to do the inspection, I found out there are several issues with the house that are not visible.  For example, the heating system does not work (apparently, the residents have been using space heaters for the last several years), several appliances don't work, and the water supply is not installed correctly.  Overall, the inspector listed over 40 issues and some areas could not be inspected because there are tenants that did not clear the areas.

I knew this was an older house that would have some issues, but I was not prepared for this amount of repairs.  We'd like to ask the owner to fix these, but he's in bankruptcy and isn't likely to have the cash to do it.  The best we can probably hope for is to negotiate a change to the price.

Our agents talked to each other and my agent's advice was, ""It looks like they're playing hardball.  They don't want to pay for anything.  I suggest we don't ask for too many repairs or they'll just walk away.""

I like the house and want the deal to go through, but think we should be more aggressive negotiating concessions.  I'm not very experienced in these kinds of negotiations, and don't really trust my agent to be as aggressive as I'd like.  But, the agent works for me and will do what I ask him to.  I just don't know what to ask for.

Sorry for the long post here is a summary as short as I could make, below the summary I have some laws I found and then some questions. This is in California, any advice would be much appreciated. Thank you. 

I am on a monthly lease and have been living in this rental for 11 weeks, I began having health problems after moving into the place within the first 2 weeks. Many health problems and doctors visits later I began to get really suspicious, the doctors couldn't figure out what was wrong and my blood work showed up normal so I purchased a mold testing kit. The kit tested positive for harmful mold so I immediately notified my land lord the same day through e-mail and abandoned the place, I told him it was uninhabitable. I researched harmful mold exposure symptoms on the internet and all of my health problems were listed with the advice to abandon immediately if having these symptoms and finding black mold, I put this in the e-mail along with pictures of the positive on my home test kit. Note I also took swab samples to send to a lab which returned positive for harmful mold a week later. I nearly went to the emergency room that day (didn't because of costs but looking back I should of) and went to urgent care the next since it was already closed.

He responded a day later saying that I am mentally insane and a liar, he then told me that I would have to wait 2 weeks for him to get back in town, he didn't offer a date of when the problem would be taken care of, if he would hire a mold specialist, and he did not offer to provide accommodations either. Not happy by his handling of the situation I found a new place to live and moved all of my stuff there 5 days after discovery of the mold in his rental. He said I didn't give him a chance to fix the situation but I told him I can't wait that long and his attitude gave me the impression he won't hire a mold specialist saying he guaranteed one wasn't needed. This was before he even had a chance to come back and see what was happening, also him saying this when I told him I was having problems as serious as loosing feeling in my foot seems like complete negligence.

I had asked him on the phone if he would return half of months rent since I moved out, he said no. I sent him certified mail, when he received it he said he would return rent from ""when I vacated"" if I could provide doctors notes. I provided very legitimate doctors notes (gave me 5 prescriptions) but then he changed his mind saying the doctor was my friend and wanted to help me (first time seeing that doctor) and that the symptoms I had could be caused by anything. Then asks me to go into his house to drop the keys off (before mold is gone or lease over) and that him keeping months rent because the electricity bill was high is a fair compromise and that I need to accept some responsibility as well (in lease written all utilities paid by landlord at his place). This made me really angry because I have potentially permanent health problems, only time will tell.



I have spent the past couple of days looking up laws and here a couple of things I found in my Nolo books and on the internet. 

-Landlord is required to provide habitable living conditions. They are required to pay for motel or housing costs while repairs are being made or rental is uninhabitable.

-A place can be considered uninhabitable if there is a mold problem effecting tenants health. A place can also be considered uninhabitable if there are no working smoke alarms or no carbon monoxide detectors (gas stove) or no heating for every room.

The place has no C0 detectors, 1 smoke alarm upstairs that doesn't work and is placed away from the bed room in a spot where it is useless, and there is no thermostat or heater (he offered to lend me a small space heater on move in), also no screen on a window which past 35 days he hasn't fixed

-For homes built before 1978 you are required to give a lead disclosure along with the lease, this was not provided, how would I prove this?



I have a couple of questions, 

I went back to the place 9 days after moving all of my stuff to try and find water damage (nearly all the harmful mold found from the swab test was water damage mold), I found obvious water damage on the outside of the house I took pictures and video. Should I inform the landlord of the water damage I found?

I originally wanted rent back from when I moved out but was told no and that the lease ends the last day of the month. So instead I now want him to pay for housing at my new place up until the old lease ends, does anyone know if this will work in small claims?

In 1 e-mail he wrote that hes required by law to return the security deposit to me 3 weeks after the place is vacated. A couple days later in another e-mail writing 3 weeks after the end of the lease. Does anyone know which one it is or if I could use this against the land lord in small claims?

I am thinking of going back there the last day of the month (last day of lease) with my neighbor as a witness and doing a walk thru with video/pictures to show that there are no smoke alarms (35 days after I notified her), C0 detectors, heater/thermostat and that most likely that the mold has not been taken care of. Does this sound like a good idea?

It would cost me $400 to have a mold inspection company go out there and do tests, open up the walls for air samples and then patch them back up. If I have this done would I be able to get this cost reimbursed since the land lord doesn't want to hire mold specialists? Should I do this?

I am a first time home buyer and have been speaking to a couple of mortgage companies to find out what my best option is for financing. My problem is, I just have so many questions and possible scenarios that I don't feel like I'm making myself fully clear.

I am in Indianapolis, IN, looking to buy a $100K - $110K home. I have around $6K in my bank account right now (my g/f will be moving in with me, but not on the loan - she has around $2K to offer if it can even be used). I have a median FICO score of 720 and she doesn't know hers, but it's much lower - this is why I'm choosing to keep her off the loan.

I don't think I want to get an FHA loan because of the increased mortgage insurance. If it comes down to it and FHA is my only option, I would like advice on if you think it's better to do the FHA now when rates are still low, or wait a year (assuming I renew my apt lease) until I can do conventional and buy at that time - when rates could possibly be much higher. 

I would much prefer a conventional loan. With 5% down, I'm almost certain I wouldn't be able to afford a $100K house. Even if I had the seller pay closing costs, there are still other fees associated with the purchase that would wipe my bank account our, right? 

When speaking with one of the mortgage companies, they informed there is a program (I don't know if it's only for first time home buyers) that allows you to do a conventional loan, but only put 3% down. I was told this would require a median FICO score of 740 to do this. Is anyone familiar with this program, and if that minimum FICO score varies from lender to lender? I looked online and saw a few places that were saying 680 was the minimum.

I feel like the only way I'm going to buy a house at this time is if I can find a lender that allows for the 3% down with a score of 720. Any advice or other information relating to programs for first time home buyers would be great. I would love to buy a home, but I'm just worried about stretching myself way too thin by doing conventional, or over paying by doing FHA.

Can anyone here advise, based on the info below, whether or not we A) Should be okay with these levels, B) Should seek remediation, or C) Walk from the contract?

I might add that there is no significant visual or olfactory evidence of any mold. i.e. can't see any, and everything smells fine. And my wife has a nose for it. This house was flipped after spending quite a bit of time vacant.

The inspection consisted of placing several ""cartridges"" throughout the rooms of the house, and leaving them there for a period of time. The doors are supposed to stay shut for the duration of the mold inspection. Signs were placed all over the entrances not to enter during the inspection, and wouldn't you know it, at one point, the seller ""popped in"" to get a document from inside. She states she was in and out in less than a minute, and I'm wondering if that might have compromised the tests. Anywho:

This prefaces the inspection results:

""Please note that TNTC indicates the mold colonies were Too Numerous To Count.

With the methods and materials used, this scale applies to:

1 to 4 total colonies per room is within a normal range 5 to 8 colonies per room is a cause for concern (illness possible) 9 total colonies per room is hazardous (illness likely)

To keep in the proper spirits of TL;DR, let me cut straight to the chase. I currently own a duplex style townhouse. I am trying to move out of state (From Alaska to Washington), and am trying to figure out if its better financially if I rent out the house, or sell it outright - and I don't have the foggiest idea where to begin. I would flat out sell it if not for the fact I regularly traffic through the city (every 3 weeks), and it's up in the air on if we would even like to stay out of state. I have family and deep deep roots where the house is, and it's location is quite amazing. If I could turn it into an income property, i'd like to -- but I don't know the foggiest bit about what is the best financial option right now.

My monthly mortgage payment is around $1450 which includes property taxes; and I pay an additional $110 in HOA Fees.

The residence is a duplex style attached town home (one half) that's appraised at $208,000 (by Zillow estimates) from the last I checked. 

As it stands, I owe around 193,000 remaining on a 30 year mortgage.

My thought process is along the lines of trying to acquire a tenant for around $1700 - but what comes with that territory? Should I hire a property management group to maintain the unit? Is this even a logical option, or should I sell it outright and get my ducks in order to be sure I can maintain a home in such a drastically new environment that I may not stay in...?

We received HVAC repair estimate of 2400,  roof repair estimate of 1100 and termite treatment at 700. There are a couple of other items not worth mentioning here, but all told it adds up to 5200 total.

This is my first time here in this subreddit.  My wife and I are looking to buy our first home in Los Angeles.  While looking around in different neighborhoods, I became curious about something.

Los Angeles is currently working hard at expanding their metro rail lines.  They will be extending the purple line from Koreatown all the way to Santa Monica.  I personally would love to live nearby a metro stop.

I imagine with these new metro lines, there will be increased foot traffic in the area, also maybe leading to more density.  I know I am one of the many who will prefer to take the train to Santa Monica over getting on the highway.  I also think people will enjoy taking the train downtown, or to Koreatown for food, karaoke, etc.  In other words, I feel like this could be a big, positive change for LA.  

This will be another few years down the line, but I was curious as to how this will affect home values near the new metro lines.  If it is a positive, would one want to jump at this?  Would it be a good investment?  Or is there a downside?  Either way, I am interested in the reasons why.

Property list:

1. owe 48,000 worth 300,000 brings in $1000 in rent
2. owe 110,000 worth 500,000 brings in $3500 in rent

Most of these are near a college campus and we'll keep them and sell the rest. With the proceeds, my sister and I will pocket some cash and reinvest the rest back into the business. I'm thinking of paying down some of the mortgages to increase cash flow, remodeling current units to increase rents, and purchasing more rental homes in the college area that the others are in. I don't want to have to drive all over town to manage the day to day operations. We want the business to pay me a salary to manage the properties and my sister and I will split any leftover rental income after expenses every month.

Currently we pay out about 19,000 a month and brought in a little over 20,000 last month. Many of the units rent below market value due to being so neglected for the last 5 years as my dads sickness was taking over, I also have about $4000 a month in deadbeats not paying.

Reddit, can you point me in the right direction of how to pull this transition off the 'right way'?

Both of us had very good credit.  Both of us could afford (each of us individually had enough cash to purchase the home outright) to buy the home with cash if necessary, but we obviously wanted a mortgage to avoid using all our own money.  We were very willing to personally guarantee the mortgage, and were willing to put down any % of downpayment.  

We found absolutely no one willing to lend to us.  Once they heard that we wanted to purchase the home with the LLC they basically said that they can't underwrite that type of loan, and we'd need to talk to someone doing business mortgages.  The people doing the business loans were much fewer and far between, and they all wanted to deal with much larger deals.  We wanted to borrow 250k and a lot of these places started a 1MM for their loans.  Anything else was smaller than they serviced.

So, we bought the house with cash, fixed it up, and have rented it out.  Now I'm considering doing it again with another house, but it seems like I should be able to find some type of loan option that doesn't involve me personally buying the house. Any suggestions?

Thanks for reading this, I appreciate your time. I'm in the process of renting a house in the state of OH where I used to live through a realtor. I received a proposal to rent and after some negotiation I've agreed upon the terms of lease pending credit and background checks with the prospective tenants. 

The prospective tenants (husband &amp; wife) filled out the realtors' form and I then use an online service to verify the credit and background checks. The credit checks are okay and the service is recommending I accept which I plan on doing.

I called the husband's employer to verify employment and the employer is using one of these outsourced companies that charges me money to verify employment and income. So I emailed the applicants and asked them to get me the verification report (and pay for it) and also asked for copies of driver's licenses/ID's to verify that the applicants are who they say they are.

However, the wife is balking at providing the copy of id's to me. She's claiming that since they don't know who we are, and they've already send me all this information about them but she has no clue as to who we are and so she doesn't feel safe sending it to us. She says she will show it to my realtors, but won't send to me.

The realtors meanwhile, don't screen tenants and I doubt they'll want to be responsible for screening.

My question is, is it unreasonable to ask for a government issued ID? Do I need to provide any information about me to the applicants? I am confused as to why she's digging in her heels at this point. I mean you can't even get a hotel room for a night without showing ID, I don't get it guys.

They think that I'll be able to rent it out (I'm living with them at the moment -- but the point was to save up money before moving out) to recoup a lot of the costs, and that in 15 years, real estate prices will have gone up, and I can reap the profits. I've taken a look at the apartment that they're eyeing, and I'm pretty sure finding renters won't be a problem given its condition and location.

If I were to do this, I know I could make the mortgage payments while also meeting my student loan payment minimums, but it would just mean that I can't pay off my student debt as quickly as I would've liked (and that I can't accumulate that nest egg I wanted). I'm having a hard time grasping the pros and cons of this arrangement, but I'm stressed out because this seems to be such a huge decision, and I feel largely in the dark. It's entirely my parents' idea, and it came out of the blue. I also hate the idea of accumulating even more debt (one reason I was so into paying off my student debts as soon as possible was for the psychological freedom it would bring me) and having such an illiquid asset. But these are all vague fears, and I haven't been able to articulate any concrete downside to this arrangement.

So older Redditors: what are the pros and cons of this? Do you think this is a good opportunity that I should go for, or do you think I should fight my parents on this?

* This was my first home, I'd like to sell by the end of 2013. 
* I need to have an exit plan $$ which is why I am asking so far in advance. 
* It was FSBO so I have limited experience (but some) with those working in RE. I used a FAR/BAR contract on my end to close the sale.
* I am expecting to make a profit.
* I completely remodeled the house.

Now for the questions:

* Should I wait until I can afford to rent elsewhere so I can list an empty but staged home? (About to pay off a vehicle which would allow this). If so, how should I handle this? Empty the entire home, stage it, or just remove 50% of my furniture?

* The AC unit is old but works fine (I'm in FL). I am planning on replacing it before I list (at a cost of $4-6k). Waste of money?

* Realistically am I looking at 10% for selling costs?

* Is it really true that many buyers want a house that needs nothing? I think this is silly but I am one of those types who gutted this house on my own and fixed it all up to save $.

* Include the appliances? They're all new, matching stainless.

How do we stop this myth from propogating?  The seller is trying to maximize his total return on the sale.
At the end of the day, the seller runs this formula:  Revenue - Expense = Profit.
-
The buyer's agent's commission increases the expense.  The seller doesn't like expenses.  Therefore, the seller is CONCERNED about the buyer's agent's commission and would prefer not to pay it.  If I'm a buyer and I forgo hiring a buyer's agent, then the seller has fewer expenses and is pleased.  However, because I don't have a buyer's agent to coordinate the sale for me, I can rationally ask the seller to lower the home's price between 0-3%.  If I asked seller to drop the home price buy 1.5% in return for not hiring a buyer's agent, any rational seller should be pleased.  Both the buyer and the seller save 1.5% by cutting out the middleman (the buyer's agent).

TL/DR:  It DOES cost the buyer something to hire a buyer's agent; probably thousands of dollars. This is not complicated yet it seems so many people don't understand this simple logic.

1353775813.0,11,self.RealEstate,13pvd5,6 years after house purchase found an underground oil tank. Asked about mysterious cap during inspection and was told not to worry about it. What do I do now?,17,6,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/13pvd5/6_years_after_house_purchase_found_an_underground/,"I've owned my house about six years so I bought it not at the peak of the housing bubble but close enough. It was a small house under $200,000 and it was intended to be a starter home to build equity then sell and move up to something bigger. Well now I'm stuck here forever or until I hit the lottery because I owe much more than it's worth (like everyone else who bought a home when I did). We purchased the home through an FHA loan and being young and naive we didn't know any better and thought the real estate agent, mortgage agent and inspector were actually looking out for our best interest. There were a bunch of things during the inspection that I thought were out of place but was too trusting to go further than ask ""hey, what about that?"" On several points I was told that whatever it was, was Ok and that I shouldn't worry about it. One thing in particular was this concrete slab in my back yard. I asked ""Hey, what's that thing?"" I asked the inspector and the Realtor. Both looked at it, shrugged and said, it's nothing to worry about. 

6 years later I'm getting my heater replaced and in the process the salesman mentioned someone who had a buried tank that needed to be removed at an extreme personal cost. That got me thinking about the hatch. As I'm cleaning out the area around the current oil burner I notice a pipe that I'd noticed before but never thought too much about (because I'm a trusting idiot) and I put two and two together and realized that the pipe is coming in from the buried oil tank that's under the hatch in my back yard. 

So now I'm rather upset, not only because I may be faced with getting it removed, but because I was taken advantage of by multiple parties.

I was given the advice to simply keep quiet about it for now and deal with it in the future (actually by the heater salesman). I'm fine with that advice despite the other problems associated with it (Yes I understand the environmental implications, however I just flat out can't afford to deal with it right now).

However I'm wondering if there would be any possible legal recourse for what I think now was the real estate agent, inspector, and possibly the lender fraudulently pushing the paperwork through to generate a sale. Especially considering it was an FHA loan. 

I'm nervous about talking to a lawyer because I really don't have the money for that right now, and I'm afraid if I put it into the light that I'm going to be faced with dealing with the tank immediately. 

That was a lot and it was more for venting than anything. I know no one can really give me legal advice here. I just feel like I was screwed over and this shouldn't be my responsibility to deal with. I know buyer beware but these were people who I hired to look out for me. 

**tl;dr: Got screwed over by real estate agent, inspector, mortgage lender by not disclosing a buried oil tank. I just don't think it's right.** 

**Update: Thanks for all of the advice whether I wanted to hear it or not. Upon further inspection and research into the state laws regarding oil tanks, it appears as though my underground tank has been taken care of properly (or at least I think it has been). The only way to know for sure would be to check the state registry and I think I'll just let that sleeping dog lie for now. Sorry if I got snarky with some of my replies. It's just a sore spot. I don't like my house and it seems like something stupid happens with it at least every year. I know it's just home ownership and that most (sorry to generalize) home owners have problems, but--there's no but. It just sucks and I wish didn't have the responsibility or I was independently wealthy and could afford to just deal with it.

Inspection turned up nothing major with the home and seller had virtually nothing to disclose. The seller I purchased the home from was quite awful to work with and was very hostile to my inspector.

So one day after taking possession of the house I'm working on cleaning and I start with the master bathroom. I turn on the shower and the flow of water is very slow so slow I don’t think it would be easy to shower with. I after a while discover that there is an adjustment on the shower head itself and I turn it up to full. I work for about 10 minutes or so and my brother comes over to see the new house. I stop working go down to the lower level and I can hear water. So I check the downstairs bathroom and the shower is backed up and over flowing. The floor drain in the utility room is as well.

I open the crawl space access and water is coming in though the floor and though a cracked drain pipe.
I call a family friend who is also a licensed plumber to come look at it the next day. He finds a crack in a pipe my inspector missed, that the main line exiting the house is back graded and the last eight feet of pipe or so has nohub bands holding it in place from a previous repair of some sort.

I have my inspector return who admits he should have noticed all of these plumbing issues. He offers to pay for all the parts, and my plumber is able to correct all of the issues with the back grading.
Once all of the ABS glue had cured we test the new plumbing by flushing all of the toilets, at once. Immediately the line backs up. My plumber concludes that there is a more serious problem between the house and the city sewer.

I talk to my realestate agent and he suggests that I call the home warranty company to auger out the line.
So they come the next day, and hit something perhaps a tree root or a break in the pipe that is might be causing it to back up. The line is still not clear.

So at this point I need to have some kind very costly repair done to the homes main sewer line. Every plumber I've spoken to who does these kinds of repair think it would be unlikely that I can get it fixed for less than $5000, if excavation is necessary the cost could exceed $20000. 

I find it very unlikely that the seller was unaware of this issue. I find it possible that they didn't know the full extent but none the less they failed to disclose that the sewer line backs up.

What do you you guys suggest I do next? I have an appointment to have the line scoped with a camera next week and I'm debating on retaining a lawyer. I have documentation form both my plumber and my home inspector that they find it impossible for someone living in the house to not have known about this.

TL;DR; My seller lied to me on the disclosure, and my inspector massively dropped the ball.

The family has been preparing by having my Aunt become power of attorney. The next big thing is her home in San Francisco (the Castro). It's a really old house that has been incredibly unmaintained. 

The house was purchased probably in the 50's. It has a stone staircase leading to the main house. The garage is underneath (on ground level). The whole house is supported on old style wood beams that look like they could either fall apart at any moment, or use a huge upgrade. The rug and floorboards underneath are a mess. Cat piss, years of abuse, never vacuumed, rooms torn up pretty bad: curtains broken, old newspapers taking up half of the rooms... my poor grandma has been sleeping on the couch (which looks like it should have asbestos) and refuses to have anyone help her clear a path to her 30 year old mattress. 

All of us in the family aren't sure how she hasn't died in the filth and clutter yet... main point: Doing a reverse mortgage for her is out of the question (the family already discussed this option). The property location is probably worth somewhere around 250-500k. The property next door sold for 1.5mil. To upgrade/replace everything and do a thorough cleaning of the house would probably run somewhere around 20-50k.

I've owned the home for 6 years.  For the first three I lived there with my parents, next 3 my parents have inhabited it and I've been continuing to pay to subsidize them while they prepare for a relocation.  My parents are now nearly ready to roll and I am preparing to lease the house.

Details on the property:

Single family ranch with 1050 heated space, but an 'unheated' connected addition that needs HVAC that increases the size about 500 sft (we use it as if it were living space, it's simply a loft) - Q: Can I market it with the space included?  The home is on a third of an acre with a nice back yard and a shed.

Hard wood floors that could use a resurfacing, probably either avoid it or do it upon request of potential lessor

Painted walls inside need a new coat and some work, planning to do this at request of lessor.

Home originally cost 325,000, located in Massachusetts in a suburb of Boston, less than a mile from commuter rail into the city.  Present mortgage is 2200, but refinance is nearing completion that will substantially reduce the cost to me.

Burning questions:

1. How can I value my house prior to bringing in a Realtor and/or how can I trust a Realtor?

2. Should I have a Realtor just do first month, or also manage the property (I'm not local, but I have a myriad of family/friends that will be)?  what sort of costs can I expect?

I hope I'm welcome in this subreddit.  I've been researching getting into real estate photography.  I have the equipment and the skills.  I have been shooting landscape photography for a few years now.  I've spent many days researching RE photography as a business online.  I have practiced with my own place and feel ready to do this professionally.  

What I need help with is the marketing and business side.  What would convince a Realtor to hire a photographer?  What would turn you away  if a photographer approached you looking for work?  What networking tools can I use?  Is there a popular real estate forum to join?  What about a contract?  Not talking about an ongoing contract, just something to protect both parties for each job done.  

I've researched the local photographers and they have many packages and add-ons, costs for distance travelled, cost per photo, and so on.  There is usually a base cost of $150 for 15 photos, $200 for 20, $250 for 25.   As a photographer, I don't think I can put a number on how many pictures a home needs.  Having a set number limits me.  Maybe a house needs more to accurately showcase, maybe it needs less than 15.  I just don't understand setting packages beforehand without knowing the location.   As for the distance, gas isn't cheap but at most it will only cost 10 dollars to travel 20-30 miles, why tack on extra cost and confuse the realtor?  You guys don't charge extra for home buyers to travel, why should I?

I feel a simple cost profile is best.  I want to have a set base rate of $150.  It will include all editing and travel.   How do I charge more for larger homes without screwing the realtor and without knowing how many pictures it will take?  What is your experience with this?

How does everyone feel about cold-call emails?  

I have written this email to send out, in hopes it inspires Realtors to request my services.

1322369967.0,11,self.RealEstate,mqkje,Advice for First-Time CA Home Buyers - My wonderful/horrible experience buying a condo (part 3),11,0,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/mqkje/advice_for_firsttime_ca_home_buyers_my/,"Part three of the rant...(if you are reading this, you must be really interested in buying a home).

Now, after that long detour, we finally get to the Offer or what will be call the Residential Purchase Agreement (RPA). This is basically a long document where you make an offer to the Seller for the property and it lists out a whole set of information. 

Tip 7: Find a blank RPA and read it. The California Realtors Association should have a copy somewhere online. 

The RPA has all kinds of information, but there are a couple that are key:
1. Offer price and earnest money deposit
2. Loan rate and type
3. Inspection period before you can cancel offer limited financial impact

Most of the other information on the RPA are disclosures and notices of one type or another. I'll talk about one key disclosure in detail that applies specificallyl to short-sales: General Home Inspection. 

Because a short-sale requires lender approval since the lender has to write-off some part of the original loan, lenders are very fixed on pricing. Once you make an offer for the purchase price of the property and it is approved, there is generally no room for further negotiations. Don't imagine there are necessarily several rounds of back and forth. Nor do you really want several rounds of back and forth. While it will only take you may a few minutes to come up with an offer price, your offer goes into some pile at the lender for some person to review and get back to you. Likely, you aren't the only offer because there are a lot of short-sales at the moment. Thus, you might wait weeks before the lender gives you an yes or no of an offer or re-offer. 

So, let's say you offer $200K for a property and the offer is accepted by the Seller. (By the way, while the Seller will probably accept just about anything offer, its the lender who has to agree to the terms). So, now the offer goes to the lender for approval. In that time, you hire an home inspector to look over the place and the inspector discovers that most of the appliances are bad and the water heater has to be replace at a total cost of $2K. At that point, if your original offer is accepted by the lender, it is very hard to even negotiate a $2K discount. Basically, you'd have to withdrawal your original offer and make a new one for $198K, starting the lender review/approval process of the short-sale all over again.

Tip 8: Find a good home inspector (certified, with years of experience) and hire him/her to inspect the home prior to making an offer. 

A home inspection in Southern California runs anywhere between $250 - $350. It isn't cheap, but you'll need to have someone inspect the place anyways. Don't be penny wise pound foolilsh here. Unless you are a general contractor or inspect, you'll need someone. 

Note: Most inspectors will give you a report and in it, it'll list some mundane problems and some series problems that require repairs. A good inspector is someone who is willing to speak honestly to you and tell you which are series and which aren't. Many inspectors will simply tell you that he/she thinks there is a problem, but you need someone more specalized to look into the issue. For the general public, that's not very helpful information, but due to lawsuits, inspectors have gotten more and more ""conversative"" about the advice they'd give. Thus, find an inspector who is willing to do everything by the books, but also speak to you freely and offer advice on the property. 

After you've inspected the property and you still likely it, you are ready to make the offer...but before you start, let's take another detour to explore ""how to get a loan.""

1319957865.0,11,self.RealEstate,ltx3r,Pay off rental house?,12,1,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/ltx3r/pay_off_rental_house/,"7 years ago I purchased a 3/2 1500sqft SFH in Austin Tx for 118k@5.875%. I rent this house out, and live in another state. Now I earn too much to get any deduction from the house at all. Last year due to an eviction and repairs, we had unrealized losses of 26k. A normal year would be more around 7K due to interest and taxes.  I am in the 33% tax range, and my CPA says that unless our income drops, we just are not going to get deductions.  

The previous tenants were a very very good lesson in who not to rent to, and I leave it to a professional now. The home is currently rented to a very stable family that will probably not be moving within a year. The rent covers 100% of the mortgage, insurance, escrow, with about $50 left over. We found them quickly with the help of a leasing agent. 

The house is currently worth around 155k, as estimated by our real estate agent. The pay off amount for the mortgage is 108K, and it rents for $1175.  Principal this month is just $120, Interest is $577, escrow is $430.  If I sell the stock, I'd pay 15% CGT, but immediately start getting $698 as income without having to also pay it back out as interest.  Of course we still pay tax on that...

EDIT - Are there any legal or tax reasons that paying off the house would be imprudent?  I know I should have the house under a LLC (don't) but would the fact that the house is not owned by a bank be a problem?  My main idea is that it would take advantage of the first years of a mortgage when you are paying heavy interest to instead take that as profit.

Also, has anyone experience this situation as a seller?  I submitted my offer last Wednesday (07/27), seller accepted Friday (07/29).  My attorney submitted his review to seller (representing herself) Monday (08/01).

I'm curious where this deadline comes from (4th of the month at 10am).  Does it have to do with the timespan since seller accepted offer?  Or does BoA not accept offers during any other time of the month?

1297007635.0,9,self.RealEstate,fgb92,I AMA homeowner who has over 80k equity on a two year old mortgage.,10,1,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/fgb92/i_ama_homeowner_who_has_over_80k_equity_on_a_two/,"I thought with all the underwater posts on mortgages I would share how I actually gained equity over the last two years on my first home purchase. We first found a neighborhood we loved with good schools and homes we couldn't afford for the most part. We rented for a year and learned the market here inside out. We took bike rides to look at every home for sale in our immediate area every weekend until we found a FSBO that fit what we were looking for. There was just a small sign in the yard saying FSBO call owner, it was not listed on any MLS. We found out the house was about to go into foreclosure, it had been willed to an heir who was very disinterested in it because a reverse mortgage had been taken out on it to the tune of 200k, he did not live the area and probably assumed the home wasn't worth that much or just didn't want to bother with trying to market and sell it. We did all the leg work ourselves with the owner's mortgage company that serviced the reverse mortgage on the home and agreed to pay off the amount of the mortgage due. We paid all closing costs ourselves around 7k and put about 6k additional into the home before we moved in to make it livable. There were some popcorn ceilings falling in so most of the money was spent on new drywall and some electrical updating. Structurally the house was very sound, brick 4 sides built in 1948. We closed in January of 2009.  We have put a lot of sweat equity into it as well over the last two years, nothing major but paint and trim, flooring in the kitchen and flooring for the built out attic space. We were very lucky with the flooring actually, we pulled up 70's shag carpet in the living, dining and bedrooms to discover original hardwoods that were in wonderful condition.  Our home is now worth about 280k in a neighborhood where the market has been very stable throughout the market crash. We owe a little less than 190k on it.  
Things I learned of infinite value to me:  
1) School districts are very important to home values whether you have kids or not.  
2) You have to be willing to do leg work yourself and call and harass sellers (agents), mortgage brokers or closing attorneys if you want to move quickly and actually get things accomplished (close). We even had to harass the owner to turn on the utilities in order to get an inspection. It only took us 30 days to close on the house from first contacting the owner. This was a major miracle in and of itself.  
3) Sweat equity sucks and is not for everyone, but it is a very cheap way to make your house more valuable.  
4) Get a good inspector! Know what may come up down the road.  
5) Learn to look past aesthetic turn offs, paint colors, bad drywall, whatever it is that can be easily fixed. Good bones are really what matters.

The slab hasn't been poured yet so it is still in very early stages of construction. We got to look at another home with the same floor plan and liked it. The building company is DSLD homes, if that matters. We will get to choose from many construction options and upgrade along the way. The house comes with a 1 year workmanship warranty, 2 year electric and plumbing, 5 year structural, 25 year roof, and factory warranties on all appliances. It seems like a pretty safe bet to us but we are pretty inexperienced as this is our first home purchase. They offered to cover closing cost if we use their lender and title company. I compared the lender to our local bank and it seems equivalent. I hadn't even considered a closing company until they mentioned it. I plan on finding my own inspector once the house is complete but I don't know if I need to go any further regarding inspection. I've heard people suggest hiring specialist but we won't have too much extra funds after down payment and everything will be new and warrantied anyways. The house will be treated for termites, so do I need a pest inspection of my own? Are there any special considerations or things I may not have thought of when buying a home like this? Other than the closing costs the price is non-negotiable, but the price seems good and comparable to the used houses we looked at (sacrificing a little square footage for location and everything being new). We just want to make sure we've crossed all of our t's and such before we lock ourselves in. Any advice would be really helpful!

**Edit:** I've been told that ""spec house"" may be the wrong term for the house we are looking at. I guess it is a spec home in a way since, if no one signs a purchase agreement on it, it will be completed at the builders discretion and sold that way.

I wanted to refinance it before (it's at 6%, offer I got was 3.75%), and my lender that had given me per-approval for new home suggested it didn't matter if I signed the contract for new home, because we would close on current home before close of new one.

Only to find that he must have been lying, because I've spoken with several lenders and they all say this could not have ever been true.   I then complain to the realtor that referred me to him.  The realtor forwarded my email on to the lender, and two days before close on new house he decided to refuse to close.  This obviously cost me time, money, and also keeps me and my son in a one bedroom.

My wife and I are looking to purchase our first home/condo in the Bay Area (SF bay area).  We are pre-approved through Wells Fargo and have about 40% of our preapproval saved up as a down payment.  We decided to go with WF because they manage quite a bit of money for me and I have a fantastic relationship with my financial advisors as well as our loan officer.  I (unlike many other people it seems) have never had a negative experience with Wells Fargo.
We have been working with a realtor who has been pushy to say the least about not only staying away from Wells Fargo, but using a particular lender that he recommends.  I have a sneaking suspicion that our agent is getting some sort of kickback from this lending agent, but that is besides the point.  My real question is, will people reject an offer because of the financial institution?  We put in an offer on a condo recently and didn’t get it, but are in the #1 backup position.  Out agent said that one of (if not the) main reason our offer didn’t get selected was due to the fact that we are using Wells Fargo. 
Since then, we have been contacted twice by the lender our agent recommends asking when we can set up a time to go through the preapproval process.  The whole situation is making my wife and I feel uncomfortable; if we are going to spend the kind of money it takes to own a place out here, I want to be able to trust the lending institution.  We will see what happens with this particular condo and we will probably fire our agent after this place closes one way or another, but has anyone heard of people rejecting offers because they use one of the “big banks”?

For the last couple years, I've been saving up religiously to have at least 20% and I finally reached the point. I have excellent credit and have no other debt. I'm a little upset that the home prices and the mortgage rate have gone up so much now that I've finally reached 20% but I guess it's better late than never. 

I currently have about $82k saved up and I found a $350k condo w/ $300 monthly HOA.

I save about $2,500 to $3,000 a month so by the end of the 30-day escrow process, I will have about $3,500. Would this be enough for an emergency fund?

Also, I noticed that the housing price and the mortgage rate have increased significantly in the last month. I know it's difficult to predict the future but I think the housing price may drop after the mortgage interest goes up even more. Also, I noticed that the mortgage rate usually drops after August looking at the mortgage rate history (http://www.fedprimerate.com/mortgage_rates.htm)

Long time reader/contributor.. please forgive the throw-a-way account.

I have a rather complicated (to me) mortgage/house sale scenario that I want to toss out here. Understand that the best thing to do is to find a real estate lawyer, which we are doing, but want to see if anyone had any advice or similar situations.

Me and my SO are purchasing a house from my mother and my uncle. The house used to be my grandparents, they have passed, and they left the house note free to my mom and uncle in some form of a trust.

Back in December we came to a verbal agreement that me and my SO will ""rent-to-own"" the house until we are married early next year. when we would buy the house. We agreed on a base price of $600,000 and after our rent credits, the net price would be $570,000.

There is an additional caveat here. Of the proceeds of the house, I am to inherit 1/6th of the purchase price (~$100,000). The intent is for me to use these proceeds as part of my down payment when I go and get my mortgage.

Priorities: Need to be able to be approved for my mortgage and not pay PMI. Need the bank to recognize my inheritance as part of my down payment. I am covering the difference between my  inheritance and the appropriate # needed for 20%+

A lot of moving parts! My questions below:


1. How do I get my lending bank to recognize that 1/6th of the house will be coming back to me as part of my down payment? How do I include that as part of my down payment?

2. How do we limit tax exposure? How do my mom and uncle limit tax exposure? 

3. Is there a scenario in which the $30K in rent ""credits"" would count towards a down payment?

4. What are other questions I need to be asking?

Any advice?,15,4,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/1g4io8/closing_tomorrow_on_a_203k_first_time_homebuyer/,"Just a little background... I'm 24/f buying my first house, no one else on the mortgage but my boyfriend has been helping me. My mortgage is a 203k with about $50k of renovations planned. 

I've been working closely with my realtor, my lendor, my HUD consultant, and my contractor, and I believe that they have covered everything with me and I'm all set. I just want to double check with you guys to make sure I'm not forgetting anything.

I am scheduled to do a final walk through tonight with my parents and my realtor. We will make sure the heat is working, all the plumbing, etc. and that nothing is damaged. The seller also agreed to do some repairs so we will be checking to make sure that is all finished. Any other advice for the walk through? 

Only other question is concerning changing the locks after closing. Since I'm having both exterior doors replaced along with the renovations, and I won't be moving in right away, I am considering not changing the locks immediately. Is that a huge mistake? The seller was renting the house previously, and I don't know how many renters he has had over the years but that means there are potentially copies of the keys out there. It's an empty house, so there's nothing to steal, but I obviously don't want people going in. It has been vacant for several months, almost a year, and there haven't been any issues so I think it is a very slim chance that anything would happen. If I don't change the locks, I'll at least ask the contractor to see if they can make the exterior doors one of the first things they do and see if that would pose any problems. When I discussed this with my realtor, she said sometimes people don't change the locks even when they move in, so it's up to me, but it's not ""100% absolutely must always change the locks the day of closing"" or anything like that.

I think that's it for now. I'm going to have way more questions as I go through the renovations, but right now I just want to get through closing.

We are primarily concerned with the following two major issues:

* No deck ledger flashing found. All the deck joist hangers are installed with screws, which are NOT rated for this use. Therefore the deck structure and attachment to the house is not consistent with generally established practices and has the potential to fail under heavy loads. Further, the 6 columns supporting the outermost portion of the deck and those supporting the outer portion of the hot tub level of the deck are in contact with the soil and are decayed or decaying. Also the deck has 2 supplemental columns installed beneath the ledger at the portion of the deck below the gas fireplace. This is a non-standard installation. Portions of the sheathing behind the leader are wet. RECOMMENDATION: Correction(s) by a qualified carpenter.

* The trim boards between the brick and faux stucco panels at the corner immediately left of the front entry are water damaged. A knife blade went into the left entry wall 3 inches at this trim board. This damage and a moisture reading of 21% in the wood sill at this corner is consistent with water damage extending into the wall and down to the top of the foundation at this corner. (behind the brick veneer wainscoting) See gutters and wall cladding remarks. RECOMMENDATION: Correction(s) by a qualified water damage repair firm including carpentry and masonry.) Weathered wood, peeling paint on front gable trim.



The seller has agreed to address all issues with licensed contractors. That would require the bricks to be removed from the one corner and inspected for damage. The primary cause of water damage is due to not having a gutter on the roof combined with the use of stucco panels.



* We are concerned that due to the water damage, there may be mold that is not yet visible and that might appear down the road. Is there something that can like be sprayed on the inside to prevent any possibility of mold?
* We are really concerned that there may be water damage in the other corner too but we will not know unless it is torn down. Obviously the seller does not want to tear down the other corner of the house since it does not show signs of damage.
* Due to the missing flashing on the deck, we are concerned that there might be water damage on the inside but there is no way of knowing unless the deck is completely removed and the building is examined.
* We suspect that the deck is not licensed. Is that an issue?
* Despite the fact that the sellers are willing to fix any issues, we feel that we should lower our offered price since the price we offered was on a home without know about the serious issues. Is it fair to say we want to lower the price we offered? Our realtor does not think that it is fair.

Looking for advice.,14,4,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/1fgzwe/bought_a_house_with_a_leaky_basement_and_the/,"I purchased a house a month ago and the seller did not disclose that the basement leaks. I am asking for advice on what to do next. In CO, the seller is required to disclose all known issues on a signed disclosure. 

The basement leaks in two areas. I called the seller and asked if the basement leaked when he was there and he that yes, it leaked pretty much every time there was a good rain. The only thing they put on the disclosure is a warning to keep the gutters clean, which they are. 

The inspector did not find evidence of the leaks. He just recommended some light regrading around the foundation. 

The leaks so far have been relatively small, creating shallow puddles 5 foot in diameter at max. However, I am angry that the seller did not disclose this. There was a fresh coat of paint on everything down there and now I know why. 

I would rather not get into a lawsuit. My agent thinks I should just do what it takes to stop the leaks and move on. We did do some negotiating on price to account for a some repairs that needed to be made, regrading being one of them. They agreed to come down a little, but not exactly what we wanted to cover estimates.

What would you do? The only evidence I have that the owner knew is not hard. Should I try to get it in writing, by sending him an email perhaps?

(No major issues! Yay!) Last night his Realtor called him up and told him there is an issue with the land. Apparently the sellers failed to disclose to their own agent that everything to the right of the driveway is actually not part of the property and the sellers wife owns it. (I'd say its about 10-12 feet wide and the length of the property.)  

Obviously, everyone is furious. Their Realtor is going to try and get the seller to include it in the sale, because literally nothing can be built on it and they won't sell it otherwise. My boyfriends Realtor is going to try and find out information on this also. He won't be buying the house if we can't get that extra land.

I'm pretty upset over this and wanted to see if you guys could offer any advice on this situation. 

Edit: Was informed that the sellers are likely the original owners of the house (Which was built in the 1940s.) The town the house is in had a huge fire in 1955 that destroyed all their records up until that date. Therefore there may be no information on the lot for the house.

Just seeking a bit of advice and guidance. 

A couple months ago I put in an offer for a house. After some back and forth the offer was accepted and I was very happy to finally purchase this house. However this was just the beginning of an incredible nightmare that has ended up costing an insane amount of money. 

Opening escrow kept getting delayed because the seller (who apparently hasn't made a payment in years) was contesting the payoff amount with his mortgage lender. After about a month escrow finally opened. Since then I was informed that the seller, in an attempt to avoid foreclosure had added several unknown people to the title and trust. The title company now tells me that even after the close of escrow we probably won't be able to get all of the title stuff sorted out for another 30-60 days. 

Since then, I've been staying at a hotel which has come out to about 3500 a month and have all of my stuff in storage. Do I have any leal recourse against the seller?  It's apparent that he's done a lot of shady stuff in order for him to avoid making payments and allowing him to live there for free, while I'm having to pay a ton of money for this. 

Will he technically be in breach of contract if we can't take ownership after escrow closes?  Should I cut my losses and just move on?  I really love the house and rather not do that. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

So how i have been reading up on all sorts of acronyms, rules and everything else. I have some scenario based questions. Please be patient. Completely new to this and still learning. Any and all feed back is welcomed and greatly appreciated.

There is one home I am looking at. It is three units. 2 are rented for 600 a month and the third is rented for 700 for a total of 1900 a month.

The selling price is 150,000.

So, from what i understand, 1900*12= 22800
Then subtract half for the 50% rule so we are at 11400
Says the taxes last year were 2561 but that should be covered by the above 50%.
Cap rate would be 7.6%.

I would be mortgaging a majority of it. So say i get a loan for 145,000 30years 6% and the payments will be roughly 870.

11400/12=950

950-870=80 bucks of profit a month if i did this math correctly.

To be honest, that doesn't sound all that attractive. I'm not sure if i am expecting too much or this is about right. Not saying I expect a million a month but i would like to make a few hundred a month.

Next one is a 6 unit in a pretty rough area of Atlanta. Says it is 100% occupied. No other info other than the sale price of 170,000.

The question i have are as follows:

Can I contact the seller and ask for specifics? ie; ask how long the people have been renting there or if they have issue with any of the renters, how much he rents the units for, any building issues.

I'm pretty sure it is section 8. Would i have to do anything if i were to purchase the property to abide with the rules for section 8 ( like a special permit or something ) or does it follow the building and not the owner.

Would i be able to go to the property and maybe ask some of the renters questions about the units. what they like or don't like. needs to be fixed and what not.


Well that's all i have now for right now. Again any feedback is greatly appreciated.

Also, i have been reading about the 2% rule. Is that something i should follow? i tried doing it for the first property and it made the sale price drop down to like 90k. Not sure i am doing it correctly.

Thanks again!!

EDIT:Thank you everyone for your comments. Still a lot to learn. I forgot about the whole PMI. If that is the case, i need to save a bit or find such a good deal that i can still make money on it. Are there any other ways to borrow that kinda money without going through FHA or that would require PMI?


A few more questions

I would assume getting a property with tenants already in place is ideal but is that a deal breaker if they are not?

I saw someone asked about owner/occupy or property mgmt. I'm pretty handy and can fix most things myself but i am also realistic and won't get over my head so i could call someone. Could hire someone to do the exterior up keep. Am i missing something with that concept of having property mgmt?

Knowing that the current owner of the property is an investor or someone that understands the business, are they less likely to be offended by lower offers since they know it is about making money and getting the best deal possible.

So i went through about 50 properties last night trying to find a 10% cap rate. found two. most were around 7-9. one was about 14%. Granted, not all of the listings told you how much the rent was for the units. If someone is getting a good cap rate, or getting a good cash flow from it, why would they sell? Also, is it as easy as just calling the person and being like, ""How much to you currently charge for rent? How much do you spend on upkeep?""

We are trying to build a new home in Florida.  We started talking to the builder in November of 2012 and are getting a USDA home loan.  We placed our $99 deposit that require in December to hold our lot.  We signed all of our paperwork and sent all information to our lender on 01/03/13 and we were told that the house should be built and move in mid-June.  They called us a few weeks later saying that the house we chose was 6"" too big for the lot we chose and had us choose a upgraded floorplan that gave us $2,000 equity.  The builder comped the difference between the houses. We went and had our fun day picking out all of our upgrades and paid extra for a few.  Fast Forward to the end of February and we get a phone call saying that the processor will not approve us until we have lived in the state for 2 years.  Our two year mark is this month.  So we then contact the builder who says the lot is ours to keep until our mortgage gets processed.  We wait and wait...and now its May, and no one has contacted us after we have sent multiple e-mails and left voice mails for both the lender and the sales associate.  We finally get a hold of our original agent who says that she has passed our info to the new consultant at the location and he should have contacted us to tell us that we are no longer allowed to build on that lot since the second phase has opened.  That was this morning.  The first contact we have had after calling since May 1st.  

Is there anything we can even do?  We feel like the builder is bullying us through this process and now we have to choose a not so desirable lot?  I went through our home contract that we signed and cannot find anything that says that our lot is given up if we do not process our mortgage immediately.  There is a paragraph about closing and the lot give up, as well as if they return our money, which at no point has been offered.


Please we are desperate here.  We love the lot, not the house and we do not want to lose it.  

Thank you.

edit:  This is what is in our contract that I could find, that I don't quite understand:

Failure to obtain loan:  If within 45 days from the date this Purchase and Sales agreement is executed by the Buyer(s), through no fault of the Buyer(s), the mortgage company, a Government Agency, a not-for-profit agency, and/or any other institutions passing upon the credit of the Buyer(s), fail to provide an unconditional loan and/or funding assistance approval in writing for financing, subject only to receipt of an acceptable appraisal, updating the Buyer's documents within 60 days of Closing and normal closing conditions, then Seller may, at its option, terminate this Purchase and Sales Agreement either verbally or in writing and then return the earnest money deposit to the Buyer(s).  Upon return of the deposit by Seller, all obligations of the parties hereunder shall terminate.  If conditional loan approval has been obtained, but the Buyer(s) alters their financial condition in a way that disqualifies them from final loan approval, the BUYER(S) will be in default of the PURCHASE AND SALES AGREEMENT and the SELLER will have the right to terminate the PURCHASE AND SALES AGEEMENT and retain all of the EARNEST MONEY DEPOSITS, OPTION DEPOSITS and other amounts the BUYER(S) has delivered as the SELLER'S liquidated damages.

Since we were not actually denied our loan, just placed on hold, from my understanding, they had no right to give away our lot?

edit 2:  Let me clarify this a bit more and update. We were never denied the loan, we were placed on hold, at which time the builder told us the lot was ours until May, which is when we would be formally approved.  We met all the qualifications, they just wanted to make sure we were serious about staying in Florida. 

The lot is now under contract with another family.  A no point did the builder tell us that we gave up the lot.  We were up our lenders ass the entire time trying to get this approved, we are trying to get in before our wedding in September, so we wanted to make sure this happened.  Our lender actually called us today saying that our loan was continuing for final approval.  

The sales manager at the community would not tell me right away when I called this morning that the lot was resold or a reason why it was resold.  

This has nothing to do with the money, $99 is a drop in the bucket.  Its the fact that if they would have called us before reselling our lot, we would have had a different mortgage.  We qualified for an FHA too, but we chose not to go that route, and would have if they would have told us.

Any advice you could offer on the landlord side of things would be great. If nothing else, this is just a tale of a really stupid tenant...


The roommate in question constructed a makeshift shelter in the backyard. No problem right? Well, he screwed it to the side of the house and to the deck, and used a tarp for the roof. Having gotten in an argument over unrelated things, we weren't talking to each other before he did this, so I had no way of knowing his plans. Additionally, he didn't invite me to his party, bought all of the material himself, and built it himself. I can assume he did not tell the other roommates about his plan either. Legally, if it came to it, I could prove I wasn't there when he built it. 


So about 8 hours after he builds this thing, I get a scathing email from our landlord, and he asks who to talk to about replacing the siding, deck railing, etc. I point my finger, and that's the last I've heard from them. 


The questions I have are these: 
* How liable am I or the rest of my roommates? 
* Is there any way he could be evicted for something like that? (Pretty unlikely, but I can dream)
* How expensive is it to replace siding on a house, and are we looking at hundreds of dollars, or thousands? 
* My share of the deposit was about $600, so the whole house was about $2,400. If it cost that much to repair, could the landlord just take it all and hold us all liable? Would I have a case against the offender in small claims court, in this circumstance?

She seems to be very on top of the market that we are interested in, very organized and above board.



At the meeting she gave us 3 things to sign:

* ""NYS Disclosure Form for Buyer and Seller.""  She said that is was illegal for her to begin a relationship with us without having this signed (we did not yet sign it, because we would like a chance to look over everything before we sign it). 

* ""HUNT Real Estate ERA Notice and Disclosure Form."" 

* ""Exclusive Right to Represent Buyer/Tenant Agency Agreement.

We have a credit union that refeered us to a mortgage compny that we are in the process of getting pre-approved and finding out what rates we can get. I'm also looking into NYS assistance programs for first time home buyers (SONYMA and FHA-- any advice or info you can provide on these would be a great help). Would a company like HUNT be able to match or beat interest rates provided my state assistance programs? Is her pushing a meeting with them a red flag, or par for the course?

She also provided a list of ""The Realty Club Attorneys"" for potential attorneys. We happen to know one of them. After talking with my parents about the meeting, they said that they never used a buying agent, they only hired an attorney for the closing process.

$3,800 for installing a DV gas insert and rebricking the fireplace facade.  There was a leak afterward and the drywall was damaged and bricks effloresced.  I wish he had pointed out that my chimney was crumbling and flashing was damaged when they installed the vent cap, I just had to have the chimney rebuilt for $1k.  I purchased the gas insert separately, so that's just the cost to install + bricks.  Two years later and it still hasn't been hooked up. He said this was because the gas was shut off, but it isn't.  I'm not sure if the outlet he installed on the mantle works or if the electrical to the insert is plugged in to the panel.

$7,800 for labor to tear out carpet in the basement and install tile.  This was insured work after a flood, so that was as much as he could collect, fortunately.  I'm ok with this work.

$6,500 t/m to refinish 1200 sqft of maple hardwood, installing about 150sqft of new maple.  I'm ok with this work also, and it's completed.  Not exactly cheap though.
 
An additional $5-6k of time and materials to add new grounded outlets and plumbing for a bathroom remodel, install two small windows, plumb in water for the refrigerator, add wiring for kitchen appliances that need to be on their own panel.  Nothing has been finished or turned on.  He put up hardiebacker and prepped it, thinking it was ready for tile.  He never trimmed out the new windows nor reinstalled the siding around them.  This all happened last fall, and he wants more money to keep working on it, but he hasn't been in touch in months.  It seems like he refuses to finish anything before moving to something else.

I had an electrician through today that says his new wiring will need to be modified.  He wants $1000 just to figure out what's going on.  There's a nest of new wiring that was never installed at the panel, and to diagnose other electrical issues that the contractor was supposed to be fixing.  He recommended that I go after my old GC's bond, and said that he should never have gotten into this if he isn't a licensed electrician.  He's going to need to remove some of the hardiebacker to install a power supply to the vanity light.  He also says the new light fixture above the tub is too close to the water level for code.

I also had a plumber out today.  The plumber was completely perplexed and said that pretty much everything needs to be redone.  The plumbing for this house is a wreck, and it has been since I bought it.   I thought we were making solid improvements, but apparently even the new work would never pass inspection to get it permitted, and I want that to happen now before I install tile in the bathroom.  He wants $700 a day for what he guesses will be a week or so of work.  He says he can't provide an estimate because there's just too much going on.  There's lots of incomplete work, like new vents that don't go through the roof and water lines that are obviously retired but seem to be plumbed in to existing lines.

Soo.... what do I do now?  Get a lawyer?  Talk to the old GC?  Get second opinions?  Document everything?  He is bonded for $20k, how does bonding work?  This is my first home and this is pretty much my worst nightmare at the moment.  I also need to have the house resided, so these expenses are adding up REALLY fast.

I did not do any managing and at some point, he (or another manager) put tenants in a property on some sort of ""lease to own"" deal.   I was quit claim deeded the property in early 2012.  Since then they have been going along paying rent, with no contract..I know,my mistake  ...until....early 2013, someone throws a mini bomb through their front window and sets the place on fire.  The tenants are displaced, insurance does repairs and puts them up somewhere nice.   So, we are getting near the end of repairs, but not finished, when I tell the tenants, we are almost done, but I really don't want you moving back in until we get you under some sort of contract with my company. I'm willing to lease at xxxx or you can buy the home at xxxxx (about 10% under market).    Tenant says, NO WAY, we had an agreement with the old company to pay xxxxx (about 20% below market) and we put $5000 down.   I ask tenant and EX to provide a copy of this so called contract and no one can do it.  Tenant takes it upon herself to move back in...on brand new carpet, with her six kids..with repairs still unfinished.   Says it's her house and she's not going anywhere unless I give her $5000.00.   I never got any kind of deposit or down payment from ex for this property, nor do I have the $5000 to give.  She also announced that the monthly payment was actually $100 more in the original contract...ex told me the wrong amount when it was deeded. 

I have filed a 10 day notice, waiting to go file eviction at the courthouse.   I haven't gotten rent since January 1, but insurance is supposed to eventually reimburse me for the 60 days they were displaced. 

UPDATE:  The tenants showed up to court with an attorney and a contract.  I don't know if this was actually the contract they had with my ex..but read the following email I send my attorney.....
We went to court on April 9th for FED, I had filed for possession only.    They delayed to Thursday the 11th.  I showed up again, as did the defendants, with their attorney.  When the judge called our names, their attorney popped up and said they were filing for ""assertion of title"" so the judge said the case will be passed to another court, indefinitely.  I tried to say that they had not filed the affidavit in time, but she told me to sit down, they can file it whenever they want.   She wouldn't even let us have a hearing, where it would become clear that many of the things in the affidavit were incorrect and that they are not making payments!   I have a restoration company on hold right now that can't complete their work, and I can't receive my insurance payment for lost rent because the job isn't done.  

   These people haven't made a rent/lease payment since January 1st.  Any kind of lease they had would be in default due to non payment. Granted, they were displaced by a fire around January 14, but they took it upon themselves to move back in around March 15th without permission. I sent a five day notice on April 11 and filed a FED on April 16th for non-payment of rent.    

   Just this afternoon around 4pm, I received a call from the number xxx-xxx-xxxx saying that he was their attorney.   This call was very harassing in nature, saying that they are going to file to fine me $10,000 for ""abuse of process"" because I filed the FED for non-payment of rent.     He said, you better get a good attorney...

We said no, then slept on it, and said yes on Sunday. 

Here's what took my Wife and I buy surprise - the sellers agent had clients he was working with that also wanted the house. The competing buyers went through it a second time on Sunday at 6:00 PM, and our buyer’s agent called at 8:30 PM and said the owners had accepted their offer. We never even got a chance to counter.

Here’s where I think we screwed up.  After our initial written offer, the back and forth went on via the agents talking.  On Sunday, at Noon, we said we would accept their counter, and our agent called, texted, and emailed their agent, who went dark for six hours. In hindsight, I think we should have sent a revised contract to help ensure that the seller’s agent actually presented our willingness to pay a higher amount to the owners.

We have had several concerns but maybe we just expect too much?

First, the comps she brought in showed our selling price should be between $369,000 and $389,000 for our area.  We were thinking we were more around the $355,000 range, but she convinced us to list at $379,950.  We have had 9 showings in the past month, but not one offer.  This is where we start questioning our Realtor.

Each time I get a call from another Realtor to schedule a showing, I send the information to my Realtor.  We have done EXTENSIVE upgrades on our house so our expectation would be that our Realtor share that information with the showing Realtor in advance so they could pass that information on DURING the showing.  Our Realtor says that is not common practice and she prefers to hold back on our information so she can use it for bargaining once an offer is presented.  She didn't even include any of the information on the internet listing and this is big stuff!  I'm talking about a 3 month old $15k roof, a brand new well pump, new windows, floors, etc.  None of it is advertised anywhere.  

Our Realtor also does not believe in following up with the Realtors that showed the house unless they are there for a second viewing.  We demanded she call the first two and our only feedback was they loved it but it wasn't what they were looking for.  We told her up front we expect feedback after every viewing.  Is this unreasonable?  Isn't the Realtor's job to try to SELL the house, by sharing all it has to offer?

I have shifted my focus now and now have $75k to assist me in the purchase of my first investment property. I am meeting with her Friday and I am open to a bunch of possibilities. MFH for renting, SFH for renting or a Foreclosure to fix/sell (I completely rehabbed my own home so am comfortable with what it requires)

I have numbers in my head on what I can spend, what sort of rent I would require should I go MFH, what I can afford if I go SFH + rehab.

I guess I am wondering if anyone else has been in this situation and has any good pointed questions I can ask her to find out if she is the right person to help me find this investment property.

My thinking is with low cash flow, I'll pay basically no taxes and build value through equity. This also runs the risk of being vulnerable to interest rates, vacancies etc...

With higher cash flow, I would have more of a buffer but would be paying more interest on the mortgage, taking longer to own the house and potentially opening myself up to more tax liability.

What are my options post close?,9,1,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/1a3exd/builder_refusing_to_budge_on_any_disagreement/,"My new construction home comes standard with 8 total outlets that can be any combination of Coaxial, Telephone, and Cat5e.  I opted to run the entire house with Cat5e, and have the relevant ports in each room.  I ended up contracting for 3 additional cat5e outlets in various rooms.  Those 3 extra outlets were all that ended up in the contract. They were supposed to put a phone line in at that terminating location of the cat5s.    


We noticed they didn't add the phone line during the walk through and had them fix it before closing.  After closing, we noticed that each room had phone, not cat5 hookups.  Luckily the home was at least wired for cat5. The builder ended up pinning everything for phone. They never pinned the terminating ends of the lines; they just walled them up in a central location.  The plan was to go with ATT Uverse DSL with the modem there, then out from that spot to all of the rooms in the house. 


After going back and forth for a week, the builder sent an electrician to pin 3 of the phone outlets for cat5e because he could see that in the contract, but would not do more. This ended up giving me 3 total cat5e outlets (instead of the agreed 11), and no access to the other ends of any of the cords without cutting in to the wall and installing a port plate on my own.


That is exactly what I did.  In doing so I found the following:

1. The phone line they added after the walkthrough had a 6 inch cat5 cable that terminated into empty space. It wasn't connected to anything, nor was it long enough to reach anything that it could terminate in to.

2. None of the cords were marked in any way.  

3. None of the phone lines were connected to anything.  The 3 total that we agreed to just ended behind the wall.
4. 1 line DID come in from the outside and terminate in the jumble of cat5 behind the wall.

5. 2 of the 3 cat5 ports that the builder DID fix, were done incorrectly.  4 or the 8 wires for both ports were cut about a foot prior to the port and as such, the port didn't actually receive a signal.


The builder also ended up doing a number on the grade of the house and put about 8 feet of rocks in the sloping backyard for drainage.  My neighbor's yard was changed to drain in to my yard, then from my yard down the rock(rick rack i think) drain to the backyard of the people behind us.  We were told this was because of the county code, and we couldn't do anything, and walking would forfeit our earnest money.  At the time of contract signing, we were promised verbally that the water from each home must drain to the street.  At the time, I was very concerned about the drainage.  I can see now that I was right to be so concerned.


So, here we are.  We have closed and own the property.  We should have walked, but didn't.  I got sick of waiting for the builder to fix the network in the way we agreed and just did it myself. 


What can I do now?  What do I do if further issues come up like this?  Would I be dumb to blast the builder on their facebook given that they need to fix warranty issues for the next year and I have to kiss ass to get those issues fixed?  Am I crazy or is their network wiring standard practice?  To me it seems incredibly lazy.  Their claim is just that is how its done, and the utility company will install phones, internet etc. Is there anything I can do legally for peace of mind here?

TLDR: I feel hoodwinked and don't know what to do about it.

Where does one even begin this process?  Should we contact the broker that set us up with our initial loan?  Is FHA streamline something to consider?

I should also mention that we have about 55K in savings...we had been living off of that while my husband was in school and I had a baby, but now we are not quite sure where to allocate that money.  Refinancing?  Pay off some of current home loan?  Pay down school loans?  Invest in an IRA?!?  

The options seem overwhelming...any helpful guidance is so very appreciated!!!

    With the utilities already split, I imagine its mostly making sure as separate properties the buildings remain up to code (aka distance from front/back/sides, etc).

But, they are working with me, and after looking at a bunch of houses, I've found one that I'll be closing on in a couple weeks.

The plan is to spend a couple months on the rehab, get it on the market at a fair price, and have it sold, all within 6 months. Best case, I'll profit $35k, worst, $10k (this is iowa, not california. We're talking about a $130k house, not a $500k)

As each ""deal"" closes, my plan is to pay myself 20% of the profits, keeping the rest in the company for future investments (more flips, and rentals)

Question on my finances.",13,2,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/164ort/opinions_on_purchasing_a_2_family_home_living_in/,"I am 26 years old, and simply getting tired of paying rent without having anything to show for it.  I am currently living in Albany, NY a city that has a lot of college students/adults renting.  I am looking into purchasing a 2 family home where I will occupy one unit and rent out the other.


I will be getting married this summer, both myself and my future wife don't have the best finances at the moment.  I have a job where I'm making approximately 63k a year, resulting in a $1700 deposit every two weeks.  Our big problem is student loan debt - I am paying out approximately $1,000 per month for loans, and paying $900 a month for rent at this point.  My future wife is in an even worse position - she is actually making about $50 per month LESS than her expenses (she graduated with an english teaching degree and hasn't been able to land a full time job in over 3 years, her parents are helping her slightly with cell phone and car insurance payments so she can get by).  We both have about $2000 in credit card debt, both of us have a credit score of approximately 730. 


I currently have $5,000 cash to use as a down payment, but that is about it.  I am looking into homes in the $110k - $125k range.  Using a simple mortgage calculator website (http://cgi.money.cnn.com/tools/mortgagecalc/) it looks like I will be paying about $900 per month after taxes, insurance, and PMI.  This is about what I'm paying in rent now.


My thought is that I will be able to get a mortgage, rent out the other living space for approximately $600-$700/month and save the rest. 


My vision of the future is that I continue to receive pay raises (I'm working as an engineer and will be licensed within a year assuming I pass the exam), and that she will hopefully be able to find a higher paying job sometime soon.  Is it feasible that we could save enough money and receive another mortgage/move into our own home within 5 years?  If both units were rented, the mortgage would more than pay for itself.


Am I oversimplifying things?  Do you think I will be in way over my head?  It seems like I'll actually be able to put more money in the bank by purchasing instead of continuing to rent.


We have attended a first homebuyers class in the city.  There are some grants that are available to lower income families including mortgage match programs, but my yearly income is too high, even though I'm paying out about half of it to loans (I know, I know my fault).


-edit: Thanks for the info guys, definitely going to work harder to pay off that credit debt first, hopefully I'm in better shape towards the end of 2013.

(First time home buyer)  ,11,2,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/15xzcv/to_rent_or_to_buy_the_dauntingly_expensive_cost/,"Hello Reddit! I have recently separated from the Air Force and relocated to Hawaii for work. One of the first things that really hits hard when it comes to cost of living here in Hawaii is the cost of property, renting or buying. Here on Oahu, for a 1 bedroom, 1 bath, it runs at renting for about $1,300 - $1,700. The small house my fiance and I will be renting come September (If I choose not to buy) is about $2,200 a month. 

I will be staying here for work about 4-5 years, and I am now considering possibly buying a house rather than spend all that money renting. 5 years renting at $2,200 is $132,000 thrown away on rent, and that just makes my stomach hurt to think about. The other option certainly has it’s deterrents as well. A small house in the type we are looking at is about $400,000. At what point does it become worth it to buy instead of rent? What are some major issues that I could run into that could end up costing me a ton? I hate the thought of wasting money renting, but ultimately, the goal here is to make some money in the process. The last thing I want is to end up paying more money than it would’ve cost me just to rent. 

A little bit about us. We both have great credit scores, in the 730’s. We have Zero debt, and have a good steady income. As I mentioned before I recently separated out of the Air Force so I am entitled to the VA home loan, which means we don’t need to have money down (though it is advisable) and we should also be able to get a pretty good interest rate. On top of that, as part of the post 911 GI bill, I receive $2,256 a month (tax free) for a housing allowance while I am taking classes, which will help out significantly with the possible mortgage payment. 

There is so much I don’t know about buying a home, and so many things I don’t realize will cost a lot of money. With the interest rate and property tax, is it worth it if I am only going to stay here for 4-5 years then try to resell? If anyone has information or knowledge of the specific real estate market here in Hawaii it would be most useful as well. 

In general, when looking for property here, what has the best resell value? (i.e. Condos, High Rise apartments, houses, ect) Also, if I do buy a house, what are some of the best ways to improve house value for resell that I can accomplish for under $30k in the 5 years I plan on living here? 

Any and all advice welcome!

My intent is to purchase 5-10 of these row houses at auctions, rehab them minimally, and then sell or rent to Section 8 tenants.

I've attended some auctions on site at the actual homes being auctioned.  All the players in this game seem shady.  The auctioneers usually seem to have a hidden agenda (half the homes they auction don't sell or even have bidders show up).  The bidders (when there are any) are very suspicious of anyone else and behave ""shady"".  The locals that show up to watch the auctions look like the local gangsters, although they are quiet and don't bid.

* Can anyone offer any advice regarding this scenario, or any general advice about low-end home auctions?

* Are there any scams I should be aware of before I start bidding on homes?

Recently my dad and I have become interested in purchasing foreclosed homes to renovate and sell.  My dad is highly skilled when it comes to repair/construction, and even though I'm still learning, I'm skilled enough to do a lot of the work as well.  Naively, we thought that finding a house would be the easy part.  We've looked at probably 75 foreclosed homes, and can't get one for the right price.  

The way we are calculating our offers is basically repair costs/taxes/etc plus desired profit subtracted from the realistic sale price.  Our desired profit is at least $10k.  The problem is that most of the time, whether we are dealing with HUD or REO, the listing prices are usually several thousand dollars over a realistic, finished sale price.  If a house is listed for 113k, and realistically it's worth 98-100k finished, any offer is going to look like a low ball.

To the folks who have been doing this a while, what are we missing?  We figured that being able to pay cash for the property would help us cut through a lot of the BS, but apparently not.  Whenever one of our offers is rejected on a house, they'll accept another bid, but it never actually sells.  The other persons offer is accepted, then the place doesn't pass inspection, can't get financed, or both, and it just sits in la la land.  We have the money to make reasonable cash offers and they are playing games with people who can't afford the place.  I know they want to get as much as they can, but you would think they'd take a sure thing.

We'd like to be able to get into this and do it for a living, but I don't see how that's possible with these prices.  We are beginning to think that the people who do it for a living are just buying houses in the hood and working for very little.  Sure, we can buy a house for ten grand and fix it up, but then what?  It's a nice house in the middle of the hood.  Who's going to want to buy it?  We'd like to stay in the $100k range give or take $20-30k in either direction.

Our realtor, and all of the others we have spoken with, say there is nothing wrong with what we are doing or how we are figuring our numbers.  But, we don't have a house yet.

To those who do this for a living, what do your numbers look like?  How long does it typically take you to find and buy your house?  How much are you making per house?  What price range do you tend to work within?

The problem is, that in my city (Denver) they rarely go on sale and it seems everyone is holding on to them right now. I have been searching for the past 4-5 months and only two have come on the market that I was slightly interested in.



Lots that are zoned for multi family are still rare, but not as rare as a built duplex and I can probably find one suitable sooner. Estimating the lot costs ~$150k and a 4000 sq ft building @ $80 sq ft $320k = $470k on the high side. I have about $180k capital to work with, so I think this price structure is swingable for me. The second unit could easily fetch $1500+\mo in the right neighborhood covering the mortgage costs. Resale of the building is very hard to gauge because of the lack of comps. This might also impact financing.



I realize I will probably have to engage a real estate attorney along with my agent. I also have a family friend on the other side of the country who is a well accomplished builder that I can engage as a consultant to guide me through this process and interview local general contractors.

I'm looking at purchasing a short sale.  The sellers want to continue to live there for a month or two after close of escrow to have time to find a new place to live.  It's obviously a little risky:  If the seller is trying a short sale, they are obviously financially strapped.  Once escrow closes, they'll have little incentive to actually leave and may not have enough money even if they have the desire.

The internet is full of horror stories about sellers not leaving after possession is transferred and this does give me pause.  However, it could be a case of skewed perspective.  Horror stories always get lots of comments and visibility.  But when things go smoothly, new home owners don't go posting all over the internet about it.

I'm just starting to learn more about real estate, but this is a major concern I have. I know there's probably no hard and fast rule. I'm sure it depends on your neighborhood, home values in a more general sense, the type of mortgage/interest rate, home improvements, how much you put down, etc.

But if anyone has any input it would be greatly appreciated.

BACKSTORY: I'm 26 and have been working my current job (family business) for almost 4 years. My current salary is about $39,000, and I don't see any raises coming in the near future. I live in a small apartment atm with one roommate. We each pay $450 per month, but it's tiny. Like 600 sq ft.

Recently we've been thinking about renting a house with another friend of mine. My roommate and I have secure jobs, but neither of us has been 100% sure about staying in the area long term. That's probably a big reason why we haven't even considered buying anything until now. But we've run into so many complications with potential roommates, bad realtors, shady home owners, etc. that I'm now finally considering a home purchase.

I have about $15k in savings. And another $60k or so in stocks/investments. So I believe I can afford the down-payment on a smallish 3br house. And if I rent out a room or two, I believe that can cover a huge portion of a mortgage payment (but I think I make enough to get by even if that source of revenue falls through).

Essentially, I'm willing to commit a few years to this investment, and put in the required work to make a new house even better for potential resale, my question is how long would I have to commit. I don't want this to be a waste of time and money.

I am a college student, recently married.  I was given a piece of land that my family has had for a while as a wedding gift with the intention that my wife and I could build a house on it.  This would be great as I'm a construction management major and building a house is something I've always wanted to do.  I've literally been designing this house for 2 years and I dream at night about it.

The land is free and clear.  I have some cash in hand, but soon (as I'm selling all my toys) I plan to have about 20k cash to work with.

My problem is this, I only need about 60k-70k to build my home.  I am extremely confident in this number as this is my trade and what I have been studying for the last 4 years, also I was a purchasing agent for the largest residential builder in my town and saw the pricing of almost every sub-contractor in this part of the state.  I keep getting told my credit is great, and my collateral is good but they deny me anyway.  I am thinking that perhaps the loan officers are just not working with me because they work off of margins and don't think they can make enough money off me.  It's really frustrating.

Before you say to go to your local credit unions- I already tried that.  Big waste of time.  Got the runaround for 2 months and then got a denial letter in the mail for a loan of 150k (more than twice what I asked for).  The other credit unions don't do construction loans.

I really want to build this house soon as my current house is inadequately insulated and winters are very hard on my wife and I.

I've looked into some local hard money lenders and it's just so much extra money.  5-10 points upfront, 12%-15% interest.  

Can banks deny me just because they don't like my loan size?  Even if I fit all the criteria (front &amp; back debt ratios, credit scores, cash reserves, employment history, etc)?  

What should I do Reddit?  I'm at a total loss of where to go from here...

Average price of a duplex out here is about $280,000 and that's way out of my price range, so we decided to go with a mobile home.

We found someone doing fully renovated units for about half that price on a nice lot.  We figured a few corners were going to be cut, but what we've ended with is something that is probably about to be condemned by the county, with $20k+ in renovations to bring it up to code.

None of the building permits were followed up on, and in the end, no final inspection was done, which means there's no Residency Permit, which, according to the inspector we hired, is required for the transaction to go through.

Part of our contract established that we would get to view the property 2 days before possession and do a walkthrough.  All deficiencies were to be remedied in 45 days, they weren't.  The place wasn't even ""completed"" until the evening of our possession date.

We were just looking through our paperwork, and we discovered that the Seller, the title holder, and the warranty are all different numbered companies.

I think our lawyer just completely screwed us.  When we asked about an inspector, we were told we couldn't have one before possession because the property was already considered sold.  I really don't need a lecture on what I should have done, or shouldn't have done.  I'm pretty aware of most of that at this point.  I just need to know if there's anything I can do now.

In other states, all closings are handled by attorneys and attorneys review the contracts.   In all cases, I recommend getting professional advice.   Yes, you can certainly do it all yourself, but at least know the basics before you enter a transaction. 

There are also LOTS of scams out there, including lease to own deals where buyers risk losing a massive down payment deposit because the term isn't long enough for them to improve their credit ratings (bad credit is why they are shopping lease options).   Sellers should also be wary of the lease option approach, as the courts may consider the deal an equitable mortgage -i.e. foreclosure not eviction.

1328320591.0,7,self.RealEstate,pa3tp,In my mid 20's starting my first real estate venture with my Dad AND an experienced real estate developer - thoughts and comments?,10,3,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/pa3tp/in_my_mid_20s_starting_my_first_real_estate/,"I make an average income working full time as a project manager for a project developer doing some utility-scale renewable energy company.  But I'm entrepreneurial and want to actually take part in leading a new venture that I'll have ownership in and gain in the upside of the real estate market.  Real Estate seems like an interesting opportunity as an investment vehicle in part because I feel like you have more control over the project (as compared to stocks/bonds). I still diversify, but I'd like to start owning real estate.  Also, it looks like it's a good time to buy real estate since there's quite a bit of distressed properties.  

I pay a shit ton in rent right now living in San Francisco - something like $1500 for rent and a car garage, and it feels HORRIBLE that its getting thrown away and not being put in equity.  I first thought about buying something to live in and rent out to my friends... But I'd rather live in areas where my favorite restaurants are, not necessarily where the best economic returns are.  In addition, I feel like I would lose the flexibility in being able to move around and live in different parts of the city; I would be tied down.  Lastly, most of the places I'd like to live, are pretty god damn expensive. I can afford renting there, but buying these properties are ridiculous (I can't see how landlords make money on these properties, they have very low cap rates).  

My Dad has bought and sold properties, improved properties, but only those of which he has lived in - not as an investor/business man. He's also extremely risk adverse.  He's not interested in speculative ventures over in Vegas, Florida, etc.  He's also not interested in putting up a ton of cash on overpriced real estate in SF.  I read a whole bunch of books on real estate investing, finance, flipping, and property management.  This has helped to get the basic framework in place, though I'm dying to get some actual experience.    Fortuitously, I used to work in real estate development, and have reconnected with my old co-worker who now has his own company specializing in the entire development stage for small single family homes and duplexes, including acquisition, design, entitlements, construction, management, and disposition.   So we are going to explore how we can work together.  

He basically fixes up blighted properties in all cash deals, and either adds units, adds entire floors, additional bathrooms, renovate them, etc, then rents them out or sells them.  He works with contractors and manages everything.  He know's his shit - and its definitely helpful that I used to work with him in the past.  But I'll want to review his past work and financials and do some basic due-dilligence to make sure everythings ok. But at the very least, I feel like its smarter to partner with him then to just go in on real estate investing just with my Dad.  

Here's my goal - to form 50/50 Joint Venture with him.  We would put together an LLC with an operating and financing agreement in place; My Dad would sell me 25% ownership in the LLC as a 30-year loan with mortgage-level interest and have me actively manage the property.  He would put in 25% equity.  This puts Dad and Son at 50%.  Then the JV Partner puts up his 50% cash.  This would be primarily a passive investment for my Dad as he already owns his own company and is busy with other things.  He just wants a better ROI then what the banks giving him.   But me and the other business partner would jointly manage it.  The business partner is providing his technical know-how, and we are opening up doors for financing additional development projects.  

In a way, doing these types of projects would basically be like building equity - so I may be paying $1500 in rent, but I'm also gaining $1500 in equity from the real estate venture.  Plus, your getting some upside to improvements, and then the possibility of appreciation if they become rental properties in up-and-coming neighborhoods.  Then me being in my 20's can move around as I please, I don't need to feel stuck living in one place.

My work schedule is flexible, so if this starts to impact my main job, I would just reduce my hours and pay accordingly.  Though I expect this to be something manageable and on the side.  

Look forward to your thoughts on this idea.

I live in a 1 bed apartment and pay about $650 for rent and water.  It has recently come to my attention that this might be a decent time to buy, but I'm kind of ambivalent about moving and about real estate as an investment vehicle to begin with.  But I ran the numbers and it almost seems stupid not to buy. Here's what I mean:

In my city it looks like you can get a pretty decent condo for $75k. I'm looking at two right now that are $79k. Good location, low-ish crime, newly remodeled.  With 25% down ($20k), a 30 yr mortgage at 3.7% with taxes and all would be about $400/mo, and condo fees about $125/mo. So all in the monthly payment is about $525.

Now, I'm instantly saving $125/mo that would have gone to rent. I'm also paying a total of ~$20k in interest for the first 10 years of the 30 year mortgage, and assuming the deduction that goes with that saves me from a 28% tax bracket, I'm saving $5600 there.  So over 10 years, not even looking at the value of the property or any equity built, I'm breaking even vs. renting (because I'm saving $15k by having a lower monthly pmt than my rent and $5.6k by interest deductions, while my down payment would be about $20k).

So the question is could I get a better return over 10 years on that $20k down payment elsewhere.  Over 10 years, I'm building an additional $12k in equity (not counting any appreciation) and saving $20k via lower monthly payments. So that's $20k --&gt; $52k.  Some quick excel math shows that's equivalent to roughly a 10% annual return. Not bad.  If the condo appreciates at 2% a year, that's $20k --&gt; $69k or approximately a 13% annual return.

Considering that money is just sitting in my checking account right now and I don't think I could beat a 10-13% return passively investing, is this a no brainer?

We've been making some initial inquiries, but haven't had any classes or anything on home buying (though our CU is offering some later in the spring).  I have a good job with a steady income of around 75k a year.  She will be graduating, but does not have a job lined up and will likely be a stay at home mom.  We have a car payment and student loans, but I still have good credit (around 750 last I checked).  Right now we've got about $8k in the bank and are socking away a hard $500 a month plus whatever else we can save in between.  

We're currently sinking $1100 a month in rent.  We'd like our house payment to be somewhere in the $1500 area.  We've currently been looking at houses in the $250k range and were planning on putting down somewhere around 5%.

So... taking all those numbers into account, how are we doing?  Should we be looking for a less expensive house?  Where's the tipping point between downpayment and monthly payment?  Is it better to burn money on rent for longer to have a lower monthly payment or to make a lower down payment to start building equity in the home?

What are some of the best resources you've found for buying a house?  We have a realtor, but aren't terribly impressed with her.  I've had better luck finding houses on trulia.com, though I did pass the MLS numbers to the realtor of the houses I like for her to review.  

Thanks in advance for the input!

**Edit**:  Okay, so this thread is making my wife cry, because seriously... in our area you can't get a cardboard box for $150k.

I've talked with a loan broker in the past and this is what she came up with:

10% down would take $33k to close and have a monthly payment of $1,600
20% down would take $57k to close and have a monthly payment of $1,400
3.5% down would take $9k to close and have a monthly payment of $1,800

I was thinking if we were able to get somewhere between the 3.5% and the 10% we'd be able to swing this without much hassle.  I know people used to do 80-20 loans, but are those still viable (if you have good credit) or have they been pretty much dissolved?  Any other thoughts or resources to look up so I can make it through this with my sanity in tact?

(First Time Homebuyer Woes)",10,1,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/is6va/if_i_cant_afford_to_buy_in_my_own_neighborhood/,"Seriously. I had a thought the other day while riding my bike regarding the demographic makeup of people in my neighborhood. This is kind of a crummy, working-class neighborhood, I thought. Though I love it, of course. How is it they can afford to own here, but I can't? (I rent for about $1,200 a month.)

More info. I live in a very blue collar part of Portland, OR, called St. Johns. When houses are up for sale, even the more modest ones (3 brdm, 2 bath), equivalent to what I'm living in, are asking about $200,000, or more, making it still one of the most affordable parts of the greater Portland area. When I get a quote from a mortgage broker, I initially hear quotes around $1,500-$1,700 per month for a mortgage payment (little or no down payment, stellar credit) on a house around $200K. I can't help but wonder how everybody else in the neighborhood is affording such prices? They either **bought five or more years ago, before the bubble and before Portland became such a destination, are holding out for foreclosure (have stopped paying their mortgage), have a much better ""mortgage vehicle"" (Rates+Terms), or are not paying what I'm seeing as list prices.**

Then I noticed as I kept riding, that even more premium neighborhoods (Overlook) are also kind of dumpy and not all that affluent, but filled with senior citizen aged people. The same house here would go for nearly $400,000. Huh, I guess they've been living there for decades, from when this neighborhood was way more affordable and they are just still around?

**TL;DR - My neighborhood is way too blue collar to be calling for these kinds of home prices. Is a $1,700 a month mortgage payment for a starter home what people are expected to pay these days?**

1376426834.0,7,self.RealEstate,1kax65,Does anyone here use a self directed IRA to invest in real estate?,10,3,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/1kax65/does_anyone_here_use_a_self_directed_ira_to/,"I'm trying to size up if this could be a good alternative to my current approach of having an IRA invested stocks and bonds (vanguard index funds). From what I've gathered so far, the pros and cons of the self directed IRA/real estate approach is:

+The rents you collect and the property appreciation are not taxable. In a regular (non roth) IRA, you pay income tax at the time of distribution. But in this case, the rents receivable, and the profit on selling the home are not taxable like they would be if you purchased an investment propety outside of an IRA.

+There is potential to get greater returns than you would get on stocks/bonds.

+guaranteed income (in the form of rents)

-More paperwork, more work period than a passively indexed Vanguard account

-Barrier to entry: You have to purchase the home outright to get the tax benefits. If you end up needing a non recourse loan to buy the property, you have to pay interes, and you don't get the same tax benefits on the rents you collect and the property's appreciation. (If you're 80% leveraged, only 20% of your income from the property is tax advantaged). A way to avoid needing a mortgage could be to pair up with a friend, but in that case, you'd need to form an LLC, which means legal fees to draw up the paperwork.

-If you go it alone, you still either need to form an LLC or buy an umbrella insurance policy.

-All the money you have to use to maintain the property has to come out of the IRA. 

-You either have to maintain the property yourself, collect the rent yourself, and find tenants yourself, or hire a property management company to do it. If you do the latter, they'll take 10-15% of each month's rent from you+more each time they have to get a new tenant. It can be difficult to find a property management company to manage just a single property that you own.

-Lack of liquidity: With a Vanguard Roth IRA you can withdraw your contributions and up to $10k of earnings to buy yourself a home, or for an emergency. You can change your investments if you need to pretty easily. A house isnt liquid, and you need to own it for several years to make enough money to recoup buying/selling fees.

-Risks that you wont always have a tenant, you'll get a delinquent tenant, or you'll get a destructive tenant.

I'm sure I'm getting some of the lingo and the facts wrong, but I'm curious if this could be a good way to bulk up my IRA in the future. With enough knowledge about how it works, is it a respectable way to have a good chance at outearning an equities index fund over the long haul even if you go the property management company route?

1376420173.0,6,self.RealEstate,1kanqk,[Tenant question] Am I responsible for the next months rent if my notice of intent to terminate the lease was never written down by the property manager? Details inside.,10,4,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/1kanqk/tenant_question_am_i_responsible_for_the_next/,"So my lease ends on Aug 31, or at least THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT! I found a new place and emailed the property manager way back in May that we would not be renewing and she replied that she would make a note of that in the file. The words ""I will make a note of that in the file"" are in the email.     
I thought that was all we needed to do, although yes I should have followed up about 2 weeks ago. Now I find out that that property manager has left the company and there is nothing in the file indicating that we gave them written notice of our intent to terminate and that therefore we've been shunted onto a month to month lease and will be responsible for September's rent.     
I have so far replied, courteously, that I thought the written notification we'd given the other manager would have sufficed for notice, and I've forwarded the email from the previous manager to the new manager. No word back yet. I also checked our lease and all it says is that we have to give them notice at least 30 days prior to the move out, which we did. In MAY. I guess I should have reminded them? Or confirmed? Or something?      
Am I in the wrong here? Aside from the fact that I should have checked all this before now. Frankly it sounds like an internal miscommunication in their office, and I'm sorry about that but it's not really my problem.     
So my question is what advice do you have about resolving this without undue rancor to all parties? I don't want them to decide that they'll get the $$ anyway by sticking me on the security deposit. We lived here for 2 years and if they wanted to be really nasty they could probably try to ding us on all sorts of 'damage' to the house. And 'regular wear and tear' is always tough to define.     
This is in Maryland, FWIW.      
    
Thank you all so much!    
Just a clarification note- email is explicitly allowed for formal stuff per the lease and as /u/notwithoutskills noted, my real concern here is to resolve this amicably in order to protect my security deposit, hopefully.      
    
    
 
**Edit**: this is interesting. She has now emailed me a description of the requirements for the move out (cleaning, etc) and asking when we would like to schedule the inspection but has not actually answered the question. I've replied that I would like her to clarify that is is for a lease terminating Aug 31, as planned, but now she's not responding. This is starting to feel fishy. She also wants (but does not insist) that we use a particular service for the required carpet cleaning and even linked me to their website.
