I was absolutely SHOCKED.  One of my favorite parts of the reunion show is talking to the earlier boots.  I have no problem with the amount of time they devoted to the people we'd expect to get a large amount of it: Cochran, Phillip, Dawn/Brenda, and Malcolm.  But I was shocked when those were literally the ONLY people they talked to.  A quick sentence from Reynold and Andrea, not a peep from 3 of the people in the FINAL FUCKING 5.  No chance for Shamar to redeem himself, no mention of Francesca's historically bad track record, no closeups of Matt's beard.  They didn't even talk to Corinne, who I KNOW had something to say.  Instead, we get Boston Rob advertising a book, Rudy being awkwardly homophobic, and some random tween breathing into a microphone.  What an unbelievable train wreck, and it had such potential.  Why would they mess with a good thing?

So I went and got to meet 44 Survivor contestants and it was amazing. You can see everyone who attended on this page here (but some cancelled last minute): http://celebrationtowncenter.com/events/hearts-of-reality-weekend-summer-sidewalk-sale-2013/


There were actually about 50 Survivors there, although I didn't get to meet a few because they took some breaks (it was a really long signing session for them). So first, here are the autographs I got. I got my DVDs of Fiji, Panama, Cook Islands, and HvV signed by people from those seasons: http://i.imgur.com/GUP64Wp.jpg And then I got the back of a poster signed by everyone else: http://i.imgur.com/iLoPm6o.jpg And yes, Billy made the crossbones in the middle....


So here are some of the standout interactions I had with people:


Corinne- She was seated next to Phillip the Specialist, so I told her all she needed was Sugar on the other side. She said if Sugar was there, she'd kill herself. 


Jaime (Survivor China)- I told her I felt so bad about her fake idol, and she said she pretty much knew it was fake but the producers told her to play it anyway. Also, she's married now to Erik from her season, and their son was with them, loved that!


Sandra- I congratulated her on being the only two-time winner, and she said ""I hope I'm the only one you'll ever be able to say that to"" 


Yau-man - I told him how sorry I was for Dreamz not giving him the car back. He said it's alright and he was so happy and awesome. 


Ozzy- was the only person all day who wasn't friendly at all. A friend of mine went too and she said the whole time she talked to him, he was staring at his phone. 


Jane (Nicaragua)- definitely the most interesting conversation all day. I asked her if it was true if Sash really did break the rules, and she said ""yes he did. we aren't allowed to split money with other contestants or bribe each other with it."" Then I asked if they chose not to vote for him to win, or if they weren't allowed to vote for him to win. She said ""we all chose not to vote for him. We could have if we wanted too.""


Bob (Gabon)- The woman behind me told him he looks like Bill Nye the Science Guy so much. Bob said he has been mistaken for Bill Nye twenty seven times. 


Aras (Panama)- I congratulated him on winning the first time he played and said I hope he does well next season. He said ""me too. fingers crossed."" Then I asked if he liked playing more the first time or second, and he said ""no comment."" But then he said later that there's nothing like playing the first time, and Tom (Palau) was sitting next to him and agreed. 


Fabio- He talked about how everyone on his season got along pretty well, including NaOnka. And he and she didn't fight off camera at all. Purple Kelly was sitting next to him and basically said the same thing. 


Terry (Exile Island)- He said that he was supposed to be on Blood vs Water next season, and he passed casting but the person who he was bringing did not. Not sure if this was for physical reasons or personality-wise. 


Erik (Micronesia and Caramoan)- We talked about Reddit and how he wants it to become the more popular site for Survivor fans over Survivor Sucks, because on Reddit you can downvote all the crap. I couldn't hear him that well though because it was loud in there, so hopefully he can clarify on here! And it was awesome meeting you Erik! Definitely one of the nicest people there. 


If anyone has questions about how any of the other tons of Survivors were, let me know and I'll answer in the comments. It was an incredible day for huge Survivor fans, and I had an amazing time!

I've got that same adrenaline rush you get when your team wins on a buzzer beater.  This episode just had *everything*, and the fact that I've never been much of a Corrine fan just made it that much sweeter.

* You start out with the merge which is always a good moment in the game because it means the game is finally about to start and the riff-raff is out of the way for the real players to fight it out to the end.

* Then we move on to probably the *most entertaining* gross food eating challenge in 25 season of survivor.  Every round was just fun to watch from those participating and the reactions from those observing.

* Then Cochran wins the freaking challenge... followed by excessive celebration... followed by Cochran explaining that no one else would get away with such a celebration, but for some reason he does... followed by everyone else saying that it was ok that Cochran did a celebration dance.

* Then we move on to strategy, and we see that Malcolm's plan to take control of the game is going smoothly and that he'll have the numbers to get to the final 5.  And with his and Eddie's HIIs, the Stealth-R-us alliance is most certainly dead.

* Then we move on to Corrine - a returning player who ought to know better - being unable to keep her mouth shut and fucking up the entire anti-Stealth plan.

* Then we have the renewed Stealth-R-Us alliance, dare I say ***stealthily*** orchestrating Corrine's ouster.  It was, perhaps, one of the best executed blindsides since a string of them in FvF1.

Second, Brenda deserved to go, and I'll tell you why. She made the same HUGE mistake that Corinne, Malcolm, and Andrea made before her: failing to realize just how tight Dawn and Cochran are. They're essentially a package deal at this point, so telling Dawn that Cochran was next up after Eddie on the chopping block was just a terrible idea. 

Oh, and never mind the fact that she completely ignored an opportunity to use Eddie and Eric to get Cochran - the only other real threat in the game - out. The game is Outplay, Outwit, Outlast, and Brenda got Outwitted.

1368904509.0,73,self.survivor,1el9dq,An open letter to Jeff Probst,100,27,36,http://www.reddit.com/r/survivor/comments/1el9dq/an_open_letter_to_jeff_probst/,"To Mr. Probst, 

 Before I introduce myself, allow me to thank you for the incredible job you do on Survivor. Watching you over the years has been a real treat, and every award and accolade you have received is well deserved. I was particularly pleased when you received the Emmy for Best Reality Host, an award that you should truly receive every year. 

 My name is Jono. I have watched Survivor since day one. I have listened to every interview I could get my hands on, of yourself and of contestants. I view Survivor as a show that captures an essential essence of humanity. I do not believe in bad seasons of Survivor, as each season has it's own individual story to tell. If it wasn't for my status as a Canadian, I would have auditioned every year since season one, and I have kept myself in shape just in case such an event occurs. 

 The reason that I am writing is because of the recent, seemingly heightened, criticisms that you have received. Many people are choosing to articulate their thoughts in a manner that is extremely dismissive to you, verging towards hatred. I consider this to be an ignorant and foolish way to approach someone who has as much experience, care, dedication, and love of the game of Survivor as you must have. 

 It is my intention to distill out the basic essence of what this rabble is attempting to state, without disrespecting your elevated position. I speak as a heavily invested fan who only wishes the absolute best for a show I hope to be on the air for years and years and years. 

There are two subjects that I will be broaching. The first is the narrative nature of a show like Survivor. Above anything else, Survivor is a show about human narratives. Without them, there would be no interest, or spark, to make the show worth watching. 

 The most brilliant narratives have always been the ones that emerge naturally from the game. I go all the way back to season one; Richard Hatch, and Rudy. You have stated, on several occasions, that it was your hope that Rudy would win the game, and when Hatch won, you thought the game was finished. However, the exact opposite happened. The preconceived notion that a former marine winning Survivor would be the most powerful narrative fell by the way side as a homosexual corporate manager who created the first alliance in Survivor history rocketed to the top. His story emerged as the narrative arc of the entire season. 

 In recent seasons it has become apparent that the emerging storylines are beginning to be put aside in favor of a preconceived notion of what the narrative should be. The most telling evidence of this is the near elimination of Brenda and Erik from the narrative of the show in favor of screen time for Cochrane, who did, in fairness, win. 

 The thought process to this is very clear. By showing more of Cochrane it is your hope to create a star, or somehow elevate him to a status above his inherent humanity. Through this process, you hope to attract more viewers to the show that you and I love so much, while also setting Cochrane up to return again, and be a long time mainstay of the show. 

 There is a difficulty to this line of thinking. At its core, it is dishonest, even if unintentionally. What it achieves is a supplication of the actual narrative of the seasons in favor of your own personal narrative. What this means is that the viewer naturally knows that what he is looking at isn't an accurate portrayal of the events on the island, even if he lacks the ability to articulate why this is the case. People are naturally repelled by what they subconsciously perceive as untrue. 

 So, in the case of Erik. By the edit he was given, he was essentially invisible, and completely nonstrategic. The frustration is that many of his secret scenes revealed a far more acute understanding of Survivor then the show itself revealed. It revealed a narrative of a person who could very well win the game. His injury, which was apparently ongoing and also explains his desire for food, adds an element of tragedy into the game, because Erik stands as a figure who was within striking distance of victory, only to have it taken away from him in a twist of fate. 

 By not revealing Erik's narrative in order to thrust Cochrane's into the foreground, you inevitably diminish both. Erik is not a silent figure who quietly floated through the game to be eliminated, and Cochrane is not a Survivor god. They are both players in a collection of players who all together create an emerging narrative for the season. 

 The ultimate reality is that it is clear that you don't care much for a certain type of player. You have stated it explicitly. However, there are many different types of Survivor viewer. There are those who watch for strategy. There are those who watch for characters. There are those who root for ""floaters"". There are those who root for the most unexpected people. While those people might revile you, or simply bore you, there are many people who find those figures fascinating, if not the main reason they watch the show. 

 By pushing them into the background, and rendering them invisible, you are unintentionally cutting off a portion of your fan base. There are people who love Brenda. There are people who love Erik. There are even people who love Sherri, or Shamar. These people are not stupid, or mistaken in their views. They are following their hearts, and by rendering the people they love invisible, or inconsequential to the overall structure of the narrative, you unintentionally insult them, and diminish their interest in Survivor. This is why people are reacting so abrasively. 

 I do respect that this is, ultimately, a television show. And it does need to be entertaining. However, it should be apparent that those who love Survivor desire something deeper from it other then the mindless entertainment of other reality shows. The gimmicks, explosive characters, and forced conflicts reveal a compromise to the essence of what the show is about; a group of strangers creating a society on an island, and voting one another out with the winner being judged by their peers. I have witnessed a steady decline away from the social experimentation and dignity of the show into a form of side-show entertainment. 

 This leads to the second subject. I feel that this tenancy has emerged because of the natural stagnation of the strategic element of the game. It has become very clear that the natural strategy of the game is to create an alliance of five, eliminate the other tribe, and any out layers, and then ride two alliances within the five to be assured a position at the top. You have stated this strategy yourself, and it has made for an extremely stagnant strategic game. This stagnation evolved completely naturally as people, through the years, figured the game out. The solution that you seem to be resting on is to have big personalities, and characters who will act in erratic ways as often as possible. In this way you hope to shake the game up and make it interesting watchable television. 

 I wish to encourage you to take a different approach. I have watched all of the seasons of survivor, and by far the most interesting one, from the perspective of emerging potential strategies, has been season twenty five. The three tribe format should become the new format for the show. This simple structural change will have major implications for the strategic nature of the show, and will always result in difficult situations and choices for the players involved, without relying on them to be erratic or unpredictable people. 

 The three tribe format has, imbedded within the structure, swings and eliminations. It is natural that tribes will constantly turn on one another, and attempt to leverage their own small group into a better position. Larger groups will be picked apart by two smaller only to have one of the two smaller break off and target their former allies. This type of situation will result in a completely new way to approach the game, and would spark a new era of Survivor. In such an environment, it would be completely unnecessary to fill the game with kooks, and explosive personalities. The natural emergent storylines that would emerge from a more unstable structural game would be brilliant, and above all, more honest. 

 It is my sincerest hope that you will return to an era where the narrative of the game is more important then the narrative of an individual person, and that you will allow the structure of the game to permanently evolve to a three tribe format. I feel like these simple shifts in perception and structure will elevate a lot of the tension from you, and return it to where it belongs; on the beautiful game of Survivor. 

Thank you for being you,

Jeff Probst and a majority of viewers/contestants are so jaded by BR and it always leaves me scratching my head.

 Here are some reasons why I'm not drinking the Boston Rob kool-aid:

*  It took him 4 attempts before he actually won the game.

*  Don't get me wrong..He played an excellent game at All-Stars, but I have to contribute alot of his success due to him playing with bigger threats. Other contestants didn't necessarily see him coming because they were too busy voting out elite players until it was too late and he was in the power seat. 
*  Russel Hantz schooled him on HvV. 
*  Boston Rob finally won on his 4th attempt...but it was against a bunch of scrubs. Sorry if that upsets people but they were weak, IMO.

At last night's tribal, he could have EASILY thrown somebody under the bus. Sherri probably would have been the easiest pick, being by far the weakest player in Phillip's alliance.

Instead, he urged his alliance to stick with the original plan, even though he knew both targets potentially had immunity. 

Why? Multiple reasons, I'm sure, but one of the primary results of this decision was that he made sure that both idols would get played. 

Had he been more covert about it, he could have hoped that either Malcolm or Eddie would decline to play the idol, and get sent home with an idol in-hand. But he went with the safer bet, which was to sacrifice himself to make sure that both idols got played. It gives his alliance a much better shot when next week's tribal council rolls around if the smaller alliance of three has no idols to use to wield power to flip the others.

Don't get me wrong, I'm still hoping for one of the Three Amigos to win it (or even better, Cochran).

BUT...

For as much as I've thought this Stealth 'R' Us thing was total bullshit, when it FINALLY MATTERED, Phillip Sheppard did what a real leader would do. He took one for the team, at his own expense, and got rid of the threat to his alliance to give them a better shot at making it to the end.

It's the one beautiful and selfless thing I've seen him do on Survivor, and he won my respect by doing it.

1374646417.0,61,self.survivor,1ixvkg,Sneak Peak of Survivor: Wolverine Lake with special appearance from ERIK!!! I owe it all to /r/survivor!,71,10,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/survivor/comments/1ixvkg/sneak_peak_of_survivor_wolverine_lake_with/,"Oh man where do I begin?  What started as a fun idea for a birthday party ended up being an incredibly special day that I will never forget.

My friend Nate's wife wanted him to have a birthday party where we played Survivor.  I begged her to let me help plan it and delay it until July when my wife and I were in Michigan.  We had a solid 6 months of planning.

After seeing a post on /r/survivor that Erik was auctioning off his shoes he wore on Fans vs Favorites 2 for his girlfriend Dana's charity Project A2.  I knew I had to get these shoes for Nate's birthday.  I won!  What started as a text joke to Carla that we should invite Erik and Dana to come to the party ended up being a very real and serious idea.  After I won the shoes, Dana contacted me and asked where the shoes should be mailed.  I asked her if Erik and her would be willing to show up to our Survivor.  The idea was to have Erik be the reward of the first immunity/reward challenge.  The winning tribe had 20 minutes to ask him anything.  We wanted to raise awareness and collect money for their amazing charity Project A2 as well.  They agreed!  

The game was played at a house on Wolverine Lake MI.  We had access to use three backyards and the shore of the lake.  There were 16 players.  8 fans of the show Survivor and 8 newbs who knew nothing about Survivor (except bi weekly newsletters we sent out).  I was able to host the game and Nate's wife Carla came up and created majority of the challenges.  The game lasted over 9 hours and involved plenty of beer.  Spectators said they enjoyed watching the entire game and all the players had the time of their life.

We got pictures and video of all the challenges but we're still waiting for people to upload them.  I began creating an album so you guys could see some of it. The whole time I was hosting the game, I was thinking, ""I can't wait to post this on Reddit.""  So far the album shows the tribes setting up camp and first three challenges and the final tribal council.  There are plenty of pics of Erik.  I'll post again on /r/survivor when I update it.  

My wife came in second and the her best friend Alyssa (a newb) won the game 6-1.  She donated all of the prize money to Project A2.  Lots of descriptions of the challenges and players are in the album.

Being the host of the game came second nature to me.  I've seen every season multiple times and I've wanted to throw a Survivor game for over ten years.  I didn't have to practice what I was going to say in the game, it came natural.  It was like I channeled Probst.  It's really true what they say, this game really is a experiment of how people will behave when taken out of their environment.  It was fascinating to see how the tribes voted, acted in challenges and played the game.  My wife who knew NOTHING about what we had in store for this game, was a completely different person when playing this game.  Even though we only did this over a day, we're still talking about what would have happened if alternative scenarios occurred while she played.  

Without a doubt we're going to play this again next year.  It's going to be bigger and better.  I can't reveal anything for 2014 because we want to invite /r/survivor to audition and play next year.  I can say that it will take place over 2 days instead of 1.  Erik and Dana said they would be willing to come again. Judging by the look on their faces, they were really impressed by the time and effort we put into the game.  

I will keep you guys posted on updates as soon as I get more pics and vids.  It really was an awesome time.

I can confirm that NO 100% ACCURATE BOOT LIST has yet been leaked, however there is wide spread speculation of who makes it far and who goes pre jury. 

Now this happens every season unfortunately, but after Caramoan was spoiled for a large amount of people, I believe it's time something is done about this. Over the past few days, it has become increasingly clear that most moderators of this subreddit are inactive. There have been two spoilers posted in the last couple days that have gone over 15 hours without being removed. This is completely unacceptable. After the mishandling of the Clayburn incident earlier in the year, in which the moderators went against the collective majority and tried to force Clayburn on us, and the ridiculous amount of reposted topics in recent days,  it has become increasingly clear that those currently in charge are incapable of doing the job to a satisfactory level.

I believe it is time that we speak up, and replace at least 4/6 moderators with people who are actually active daily in this sub. We deserve to have a subreddit that is moderated by those who will actually do their job and don't just tune in when the show is being aired. I am a massive fan of Survivor and love discussing the show with all of you, and to ensure that we have a spoiler free summer, action needs to be made before a real boot list is leaked.

 One of the things I adore doing with survivor is writing up lengthy, in-depth, analysis of each player, at some point. I've really been holding off on this season for two reasons. A) The pre-merge game of this season was particularily absurd. B) The merge itself was particularily chaotic, and there were just too many unknowns. I feel like the game has stabalized now, and it's worth doing. 

 Warning: I guarentee this will be long. There will not be a TL;DR. Hope you enjoy it as much as I enjoy writing it. 

 Oh, and big big thanks to CharliePancakes for his really excellent alliance charts. They're super duper helpful, and fun. 

http://imgur.com/TsdfhkP 

I'll start with the guys who I think are sunk. 

Reynold: This guy seems like a really nice guy who messed his game up extremely early on. Getting into an overt alliance of four is just an extremely bad idea that exploded in his face. Since then he's really been trying to make something happen, but it's just not going to pan out for him. He doesn't have the numbers, and nobody wants to work with him because nobody wants to compete against him in challenges. Really high up there as the next guy voted out. 

Malcolm: I straight up think Malcolm's own cockiness cost him this game. I think he looked at Dawn and Andrea and thought ""There's a nice old lady and a dumb blonde I can manipulate."" He did not respect these players and it's going to cost him hard. They played him big time. 

 He does have a super secret idol that only he knows about. There is no way he doesn't play that next time. His best case is to take out someone like Andrea, but it's extremely likely that the vote is getting split next episode and Reynold will go home. 

 Unless Malcolm starts winning immunities left right and center, and finding idol after idol, he'll see two more tribals. 

Eddie: This chap really hooked onto the Reynold train and it's just been his downfall at every turn. Eddie definately holds the opinion that being a strong, fit, good-looking person is something that many people aspire for, and he's expected special treatment because of it the whole time. This, to me, is the heart of the failing of his game. He sees himself as a natural leader and expects people to listen to him, but it's just never been that way in this game. 

 His only saving grace is that he is working with Andrea. While he did vote against her last tribal, he was the guy who spilled the beans that his alliance was targeting her, which lead her to switch the vote to Michael. When Reynold and Malcolm leave the game, he might step into a useful pawn position for Andrea, but that's the extent of his game. 

 My gut is telling me that Andrea will try to keep him around after Malcolm and Reynold go, but that will be her taking a strong position, which can be disasterous in this game. Unless she feels confident that keeping Eddie gives her full control of the game, which it won't, she'll give him up. He served his purpose with this last episode anyway. 

 My gut tells me Eddie goes home after Malcolm and Reynold. 

Sherri: I like Sherri. I really do. But there's just no way Eddie goes and Sherri doesn't. I definately think there's enough of a push of ""Favorites to the end"" that they're not going to be interested in keeping a fan around for someone to use as a pawn. Phillip is the controlling player here, and he would probably love to keep Sherri, but there are five players who will definately have something to say about that. 

 So, to make myself fully clear. I think Sherri, Eddie, Reynold, and Malcolm are already done in this game. Baring some kind of immunity run, or idol mania, I just don't see how it goes any other way. The Favorites are showing every sign of sticking it out to the end, and that means eliminating the Fans, and anyone who allied with the Fans. 

 The Favorites

 Andrea: I've been pretty impressed with Andrea, and last episode really tightened that impression for me. She moved the pieces around to save herself, and did exactly what we love to see a strong player do. Maneuver and manipulate. 

 I'm glad she convinced Dawn to stick with Michael. It was the strongest move, given the idol and numbers situation. 

 The question now is how does she find her way into the final three. What I've really been liking about Andrea is her fluidity. Right from day one she's made it a point to work every side and work every angle she can. This means that there are a few avenues that she might take to get into the final three, based on what the game gives her. 

 I think Andrea is extremely aware what the sub-alliance structure of the ""Stealth R Us"" alliance. Her first target is going to be Dawn or Cochran, probably Dawn. I feel like her intention has always been to work with Phillip and take him to the end, just like everyone else in the Stealth R Us team. 

 If she can manage to convince Phillip to take out Dawn, then Cochran, and then either Brenda or Erik, that's how she gets into the final three with a winning vote. She'll be sitting beside a buffoon that no one will vote for, and someone who didn't do anything the whole game. It seems to be her best shot at winning. 

Phillip: The tragic aspect of Phillip is that he's actually playing a good game. The problem is that he has such a repellant personality that no one will respect it. You just cannot win the game by pissing people off the whole time and declaring yourself the best. 

 Phillip is going to act in his own best interests though, which is to play a strategic ""Boston Rob"" style game. (He talks about it enough, so everyone will see it coming.) The problem with that is that Rob played with dummies.

 I honestly don't know who Phillip will target first. I think he really wants to sit at the final three with Brenda and Erik so that he can be the only one left with claim on the strategy aspect of the game. 

 I can see a situation play out where Phillip and Andrea target Dawn and Cochran, using Erik and Brenda as votes to achieve that, and then Phillip turns on Andrea leaving a Brenda/Erik/Phillip final three. 

 If this plays out, I think Erik wins, even though Phillip did, without question, play the stronger strategic game. There is a thresh-hold to how much a player will take the ""I played a strategic game"" arguement before ""You were a fucking prat"" overrides it. Russel Hantz proved that twice, and Phillip, if he makes it, will again. 

Dawn: I'm in love with Dawn's game. I don't fully understand the crying, but I'm a young male, and she is a middle aged female. I think Dawn has been hustling her buns in this game, but I'm not convinced it will be enough. 

 Her first target is probably going to be Andrea. I can see a scenario in which Brenda and Erik vote along with her and Cochran to make that happen. The problem is that, when it comes down to the final four, there's no way anyone will let her in. 

 Survivor has a long history of middle aged women placing fourth. Everyone just knows that if you let a middle aged woman into the final three, unless you are also a middle aged woman, or man, you're going to lose. 

 And I strongly believe Cochran will turn on Dawn if it comes down to it. While this time would be a bit more personal of a betrayal, I just don't think he would mind doing it to sit in the finals against Phillip and a floater. 

 I see Dawn making it to fifth or fourth before going. If she makes it to the end, through whatever method, she's probably going to win. I hope this happens, but I have a hard time seeing it. 

Cochrane: I actually think Cochrane's in the best position. I don't think he'll be the first one targeted come the final six, and he'll be able to bounce off of whoever gets sent home. 

 Like Dawn, I think he'll be gunning for Andrea straight away. It's entirely possible that Erik and Brenda will vote against him, and just get him gone, in which case, he was screwed from the get. 

 I think Cochran's final three strategy is Him, Phillip, and either Erik or Brenda, who are essentially doing the same thing at this moment; floating. 

Erik/Brenda: These two are just laying low and biding their time. I think this is a perfectly valid strategy, and it has a good chance of landing one of them in the final three. 

 I think Erik is banking on the idea that he's going to get to the final six and be able to go on an immunity run. This was evident when he chose to go with the Favorites alliance instead of jump ship with Malcolm. He just looked at the competition, and thought ""I'd rather go up against an old lady, an old man, a nerd, an injured hot lady, and a regular hot lady, then three strong men any day."" Brenda is probably thinking the same thing. 

 I do think Brenda is hoping she can just slip in to the final three Sandra style. ""Just send home anyone but me."" 

 In the end, with this group, I don't think this style of play will be rewarded. Someone like Cochran will *definately* take it from them. 

 Still though, it will be interesting to see their final moves in the game. 

Conclusion: While it would make for excellent television, I don't see Eddie and Sherri lasting into the final six. Every Favorite is hyper-aware that keeping a pawn alive in the game is dangerous as hell. The blowback from even floating the idea could be game ending. ""So, what say we vote for not Eddie?"" Says Andrea. ""Good idea!"" says everyone else, and they vote out Andrea. 

 In a funny little twist of fate, I think Erik and Brenda are going to be the king makers this season. There's going to be a clear divide between Andrea and Cochran/Dawn. It is possible that Phillip will ally more strongly with Andrea which makes it a 2/2 tie, with Erik and Brenda as the swing. 

 Imagine that scene. Erik and Brenda together, chatting about which way they should go. 

Erik: So... who are you voting for? 
 
Brenda: I dunno. Who are you voting for?

At the end of the day, my money is on Cochrane taking home the money. I think his position is extremely strong, and I think he is severely underestimated by his tribe mates. I think it's his plan to sit beside Phillip and Brenda/Erik, and he's posed to execute that plan. 

 Final Closing Thought: All of this could be tanked by idols and immunity runs. It's just possible that one person is invincible the whole time. Or even a couple people just get picked off because of idols. That's what makes survivor great. Anything can happen. 

Phew! Big long one. If you got this far, good for you!

Francesca : She made history last night by being the first survivor to be voted off first twice. She probably isn't the worst player ever but she has always played to hard and never knew how to be patient and quiet.

19 . Allie : The last person brought into the cool lunch table alliance she has also been the most obvious member (despite what Reynold intended) by her night time behaviors with Reynold. She also lacks the physical ability of the boys and Hope is a pre law student with Southern charm who was also a charter member in the alliance. If a cool kid is going it'll likely be Allie.

18 . Brenda : Brenda was immediately recognized as a threat and most of the favorites haven't made any contact to her. She was Francesca's right hand woman. Although she's good in challenges but so are Erik and Brandon and they are both perceived to be far less strategic and intelligent than Brenda.

17 . Brandon : Brandon may have attempted to start a sequel to the Mikayla saga with Andrea but luckily it failed. None the less he was good in challenges and people found themselves surprisingly liking him. However between spearheading the anti andrea alliance, his behavior last season and his unpredictable nature Brandon might be going home very soon.

16 . Erik has already shown himself to be subtle and observant to what is going on coupling this with his challenged prowress and you have a dream survivor player. Unfortunately I'll have to put Erik this low because he put himself on the wrong side of the numbers despite knowing what was up. However the fact that he is not intimidated by other players like he was in his last season is a beacon of hope for our favorite ice cream scooper.

15 . Shamar : Shamar has had some very peculiar behavior so far. He did well in challenges. Refused to do work at camp. Got in a fight. Then invented fire winning the tribes respect. Shamar is a huge wildcard which could either benefit him or screw him over. However Shamar does seem to be somewhat aware to how he's perceived by the damage control he's done (usually right after he upset or shocked someone).

14 . Hope : Hope was quickly added to the cool lunch table alliance but that is more a negative at this point. She will be picked off early on in the alliance simply because of Reynold and Eddie's physical prowress.

13 . Julia : Let's be honest Julia wasn't seen much this episode. She's under the radar and in an alliance of four (actually 3 + 2 maybes) so I guess kudos to her.

12 . Eddie : Eddie does not seem aware that this is Survivor not the bachelorette but either way he will likely be kept along simply so that the Fans can compete against the favorites in challenges.

11 . Sherri : Pretty much Julia's entry but her out of Survivor credentials have me thinking she could be a real threat.

10 . Andrea : Andrea received 4 votes yesterday and has drawn suspicion from everyone except her true foursome alliance. Dawn and Cochran are already suspicious of her and she's been caught double dealing. Luckily for her she's in the core with Phillip and he probably see's her as his greatest ally. Interestingly enough Andrea and Ralph are the only Redemption Island contestants that Phillip didn't seem to have any true malice for (except for maybe Ralph being a Zapatera).

9 . Reynold : I had high hopes for Reynold and he's been half meeting my expectations. He's been great with challenges, seems aware/intelligent in confessionals and his alliance with Allie was smart for the the first 5 minutes before they went at eachother like rabbits. He's a douche, but he's also aware, intelligent, and charming.

8 . Matt : Matt seems a lot more low key and humble than I would have expected a Lex/Rupert hybrid to be. He doesn't seem to be too good at challenges but between his alliance with Michael and his hardwork attitude he will be around for a while.

7 . Malcolm : Malcolm had a very quiet episode. However he was perceived by the Francesca alliance as being very tight with Phillip. He did well in the challenges despite losing immunity and being under the radar is probably for the best because it's the opposite of what Russell does. Knowing Malcolm from last season he is likely employing his fall of an empire stategy that he did with Swan on Phillip. Meaning let them think they're the leader, do your work, fly under the radar so they underestimate you while Our dear leader gets all the bullets.

6 . Laura : Outside of Michael Laura seems to be the most observant of the fans. She's already in an alliance to target the cool kids and with numbers she should be able to have control.

5 . Phillip : Say what you will about him but he's actually played well tonight. He didn't get in a fight over crispy rice, he was generally quiet (especially to Franny), and he managed to employ one of the BR rules. Although many may say it won't work without the Robs likability Boston Rob lost in the finals the first time for hurting feelings and won the second time despite hurt feelings because he was with Phillip who was more disliked and Natalie who makes Amanda's jury speeches sound like she could be a Kennedy.

4 . Dawn : Cochran was right we can all see a new Dawn. She isn't bitter and is all about business and making the right moves. She and Cochran will decide on who goes on the favorites tribe and she may be more dangerous than people assume.

3 . Corinne : Corinne seems to be the second most liked person on her tribe to the point that Francesca suggesting her name might have killed any lingering thought of joining in her war against Phillip for good. Corinne is a core member of Stealth r us 2 and should be around for a while.

2 . Michael : Michael is easily the best fan. He knows what to do, people like him and he managed to use one of the BR rules without Mariano's guidance (make an alliance in an alliance). Michael has very subtle near complete control over the fans tribe which is an ideal way to play survivor and he has Matt in his back pocket as an ace in the hole. The only thing that may sink him is if he gets caught double dealing too early or he tries to get another ace in Shamar who is just to unpredictable at this point.

1 . Cochran : He was nervous, then bullied, then taking advantage of his last season but this year Cochran is in the perfect spot. Every woman wants him (for their alliance) and every man wants him in their alliance. He and Dawn have a lot of control of the favorites tribe and he is probably the most observant favorite or at least should be able to know what the other players are doing. He also seems to be genuinely likes by the fans without being seen as a threat.",,False,self,t5_2qhu3,False,,,True,t3_18jy5q,http://www.reddit.com/r/survivor/comments/18jy5q/week_one_power_rankings/,

We'll all probably learn something new about the show we didn't know. I'll start with a few off the top of my head.

- Survivor staff are not allowed to drink water in front of the contestants (IE when filming challenges)
- Denise Martin lied at the Survivor China reunion about losing her job resulting in Mark Brunett giving her $50,000 out of sympathy. Turns out she was lying about that as her school told their side of the situation. She never got the money.
- Challenges weren't tested for the first two seasons. They started testing them after a challenge in Survivor Australia where survivors had to hold lots of weight, and Mike Skupins plank broke in half.
- Survivor Fiji was supposed to have 20 contestants, but Mellisa McNulty who was supposed to be on the show had a panic attack and dropped out 1 day before filming.
- Jennifer Lyon of Survivor Palau is the only contestant to have passed away. She died of cancer on January 19, 2010.
- Survivor challenges go through a few test runs. First is a dry run to make sure it works as planned. Second+ times are full on tests with camera men filming so they know how to get a good shot. Challenge testers are encouraged to find ways to cheat and attempt different strategies during the challenge.

I'll probably think of more, but that's good for now.",,False,self,t5_2qhu3,False,,Cochran,True,t3_1bwmzk,http://www.reddit.com/r/survivor/comments/1bwmzk/random_survivor_factoids/,

----------------------

Hello /r/survivor,

I've noticed some people have to watch the show on a delay or have to wait more than a day. I wouldn't mind streaming the entire finale + the reunion show for the community tonight.

The only downside is I live on the US West so I will be 3 hours behind the East.

I will add a countdown to the stream once I make sure everything is ready to go. This is my first time streaming so pray I don't run into issues.

I am running a test stream right now. Please check it out and let me know if any of you have issues.

---------------

**Countdown:** Over

**Stream:** [Offline](http://twitch.tv/redditSurvivor)

**Password:** caramoan

-----------

*Stream News:*

^1 Running rerun episodes, but stream will go down a couple hours before showtime.

^2 I will add a countdown timer for when the stream starts within the next hour or so.

^3 A countdown for the finale has been added.

^4 The stream will go offline 3 hours before the countdown hits zero.

^5 Stream is now offline and return once the countdown finishes.

^6 Stream back online, listen to some chill music as we countdown

^7 Stream offline, thanks all for a wonderful night. See you all next season, maybe? ",,False,self,t5_2qhu3,1368426316.0,,Andrea,True,t3_1e6yog,http://www.reddit.com/r/survivor/comments/1e6yog/does_anyone_need_a_live_stream_for_tonights_finale/,

We carried out this ban on Saturday so as to not interfere with discussion of the most recent episode. Clayburn was removed as moderator because his comments in discussion threads were found to be toxic towards our goal of a friendly community to discuss Survivor. The hope was that this removal would serve as a warning to Clayburn and he would begin contributing to discussions in a constructive manner. Unfortunately, numerous complaints received about comments he made last week, particularly regarding things said by Corrine about Michael, showed that this was unsuccessful.

We ask for the community to join us in moving on from this and to keep discussion outside this thread focused on Survivor. Should Clayburn decide to contribute positively to discussion under a different user name, he will be as welcome as anybody else. However, any attempt to derail discussion and stir up drama will be removed. We understand that this goes beyond the normal moderation philosophy here, and this represents an isolated decision and not a change of general policy.

Thanks,

The r/survivor moderators",,False,self,t5_2qhu3,False,,,True,t3_1b2kzb,http://www.reddit.com/r/survivor/comments/1b2kzb/meta_former_moderator_clayburn_banned/,moderator

1362098705.0,39,self.survivor,19fjx0,The new Survivor record set last night highlights the biggest flaw of this season so far. [Spoilers],56,17,80,http://www.reddit.com/r/survivor/comments/19fjx0/the_new_survivor_record_set_last_night_highlights/,"Last night Hope was voted out with 1 confessional over the course of 3 episodes, or an average of 0.33 confessionals an episode. This sets the record for lowest amount of average confessionals over the past 26 seasons of Survivor. She takes the record from [](/s ""Whitney Duncan of South Pacific"") who got 4 confessionals over 11 episodes, for an average of 0.36.

The reason for this? Unbalanced editing. Yes, this season has big characters, but did we really need to see that 1 minute clip of Phillip talking about how he plays basketball last night? Did we need all the scenes of Brandon talking about how he's going to cause chaos last week? Last week, 8/19 players didn't get a single confessional. But we did get to see Phillip introduce all 6 members of his alliance to the cameramen. Now I like Phillip, but some balance would be appreciated!

The following is just speculation, but it involves predictions based on the editing so I'll spoiler tag it just in case. There is a Samoa spoiler though!

[](/s ""Another huge issue with unbalanced editing, is that it makes it a lot easier to lump Survivors into two groups, has a shot at winning, and does not have a shot at winning. Based on the editing alone, for the favourites we can easily say that Brenda and Corinne have no shot, and Erik is essentially in the same boat. For the fans, Julia has no shot. All three (or four) could make it to the merge, but none will win. Why? We've barely seen them. There's no way a winner would be so non-existent in the first three episodes. Now you could argue that Natalie White didn't get a confessional until episode 4, she was on a season with Russell, who had 27 confessionals after 3 episodes. After 3 episodes of Caramoan, Reynold has the most, with 11."")

The one that surprised me the most was the fact that one of the contestants, Tanya Vance's father died while she was at losers lodge. [Source](http://www.realitytvworld.com/news/father-of-reported-survivor-thailand-contestant-dies-in-accident-while-filming-still-underway-465.php). It's just crazy to think that I've never heard it mentioned before.

So, do you guys have any interesting ""Survivor"" stories that you're surprised people don't bring up a lot?

Oh, and some other interesting pieces of info were that Chuay Gahn voted out John Raymond first was because not only was he bossy, but he was kind of a creeper when it came to interacting with Tanya. **SPOILER** Also, when Ken asked Brian to tell the jury why he targeted Ted early on that merge, Brian kind of dodged the question. Ken said later on in interviews that he wanted Brian to confess that he said ""We can't have Ted winning this game because that would make two black winners in a row"".

**Edit**: Some other ones that people might post or that get thrown around a lot are:

- Shane &amp; Aras finding a brick of cocaine washed up on shore.

- Sash allegedly offering to pay off Janes mortgage if she gave him her jury vote (which is strictly against the rules of ""Survivor"" that you can't bribe people with promises of prize money), which resulted in the producers not allowing anyone to vote for him in the end. Though, this story is not confirmed, it's interesting to note that in the voting confessionals they typically put up for the CBS website Janes was the only person that episode not to have hers show, so we don't know what she said when she voted and she did vote for Sash, which ostensibly in the context of the show had no pretense.

1365442869.0,42,self.survivor,1bxhfx,Yet another asinine idea for a Survivor season that somebody has probably had before.,54,12,33,http://www.reddit.com/r/survivor/comments/1bxhfx/yet_another_asinine_idea_for_a_survivor_season/,"Take the concept of One World, where everybody lives on the same beach, but instead of dividing them into two tribes on day one, have them all live as one tribe.  But here is where it gets crazy, so stay with me.  So, in my iteration, we would have two returning players (but it isn't 100% necessary), and they would need to be strong leaders/challenge performers, because they would be designated as captains.  At the start of the first immunity challenge, they do a schoolyard pick 'em (probably alternating man/woman) to form two teams.  The team that wins immunity/reward stays at camp, and the losers go to tribal council.  They come back to the camp and continue on the game, essentially as two teams, one tribe, one camp, and the game begins.  But WAIT! Because at the next immunity challenge, we are doing the SAME DAMN THING!  That's right, a school yard pick 'em at every pre-merge challenge.  What interesting dynamics could unfold!  How would alliances form, and would it be reflected in the picking?  Would strength still be valued knowing they could end up on the other team?  Would alliances throw challenges to protect numbers?  I also think it would be a great season to reintroduce exile island, which I've always liked thematically, and the rebirth of the HIDDEN (actually hidden) immunity idol.  Also, assuming there would be rewards, how would the tribes share them?  At least I think it would be a fun season.  Or maybe it would suck.  Who knows?  Thoughts?

To clear up any potential confusion: what I mean by schoolyard pick 'em is each person picks the next, not the Captains pick the entire teams.  At least that's how we did it when I was at school.  Also, the Captains would change from week to week in some specific way, either by a reward challenge win, or by random draw, or some other concoction.

Also: Considering challenge performance will not actually be as important as a strong social game, it would be a perfect opportunity to bring back some of the best social players that weren't exactly the strongest physical threats: Rob C., Stephen, Todd, MAYBE EVEN SOME WOMEN?!?! (hah, right... women... good luck selling that to the producers).

Challenge-Throwing: Many people have been voicing concerns about the possibility that a team would be strongly inclined to pick strong players not in their alliance and throw the challenge to get rid of them.  Rather than reply to each of these people, I will put my thoughts on this up here. This simply wouldn't happen... The amount of things that have to come together for a team to throw a challenge and then eliminate somebody is astronomically high.  First off, the teams don't get picked until right before the challenge starts, therefore any strategizing would have to take part beforehand, and it would all go to shit if the other team picks one of the necessary components to the plan.  On top of that, Exile Island plays a factor.  If the other team decides to send to Exile Island the player you threw the challenge to vote out, then you have to target one of your own.  What if he has an immunity idol? Accepting the possibility of a combined reward/immunity, why give up reward and put yourself at risk of elimination at the same time? How big would your alliance have to be? 12? 14?  You are really counting on the loyalty of THAT many people?  Really?  REEEEALLY??? No smart player would EVER consider this strategy with so many variables.  The end.  

Any season that had tribe swaps put people in MUCH BETTER position to throw challenges, yet they still only acted on it very seldom.  On top of that, many of the times a challenge was thrown, it was to eliminate somebody who was a burden to camp-life, not a strong player.  In conclusion: challenge throwing simply would not happen, and even if it did, it would add a new strategic depth to the game that makes the boot order far less predictable week to week.

1. Demographically split season (always have swaps).
2. Not a true tribal swap, a third tribe was absorbed by the other two.
3. Not a true tribal swap, each tribe was able to kidnap two members from the opposing tribe.
4. Only used once (Janu).
5. Two people at a time (one from each tribe) sent to exile (until merge).
6. Idol used before voting.
7. Idol able to be played after the votes are read.

The game was new to everyone. Players and viewers alike were still learning how people were going to react to the environment. Seasons for many years now seem to focus almost completely on the social aspects of the game. We're at the point of the game where we say ""Okay so they're deserted, same story, we know they can survive. Get to the game now!"". I understand why the producers have leaned in this direction, but part of me misses that sense of adventure that initially drew us to the show. I don't know about you guys, but the survival aspect is one of the biggest reasons I prefer survivor over say Big Brother. I tried watching big brother, but couldn't get past 3-4 episodes. However I've seen every Survivor season at the time they aired, and re-watched a few.

**Summary:** Basically, part of me hopes that in a future season, they will do something new and interesting by throwing a curveball to the players to revive the sense of adventure that the first few seasons had. I'm not sure what they could do, but I'd like to discuss it.",,False,self,t5_2qhu3,False,,Cochran,True,t3_19nvw2,http://www.reddit.com/r/survivor/comments/19nvw2/anyone_else_miss_the_sense_of_adventure_from_the/,

...where *each and every* contestant, for one season, is undeniably amazing and exemplary both physically and mentally.  I want to see nothing but professional triathletes, active duty Green Berets and Navy Seals, Gold-Medal Olympians, champion bodybuilders, Full Contact Black Belt MMA fighters, etc etc.  

And they'd all have to pass a psychological exam attesting to their above-average will and fortitude, AND and IQ test with an impressive minimum score (think like 125).  Where each tribe looks and acts and thinks like they just walked out of *Gattica* or climbed down from Mt Olympus.  Strong, successful, intelligent, *genuinely* tough, top-3-or-4-percentile type-individuals.

And they'd be dropped on the beach with nothing but, like, a single machete, and nothing else.  And every challenge would look like something from *American Ninja Warrior* or an Ironman competition, incredibly and unbelievably grueling, and when there was a puzzle, it'd be something devised by Mensa, not a silly 4th grade brain teaser or crossword search.  The kind of stuff that might legitimately kill normal folks.

I think it would be a nice change, for one season.  A break from the typical to-be-expected stereotype caricatures; no more whiny housewives, no more ditsy boob-jobs, no more ignorant inarticulate rednecks or loudmouthed ghetto screamers that all make their appearance season after season. I'm tired of watching losers bitch and moan about the rain and have emotional breakdowns because they don't have access to enough peanut butter or because they miss their mommies after two weeks.

I want to see 20 ruthless, motivated, proven ubermen/women in their prime go at it with almost no-holds barred in the toughest survivor ever devised.

**Analysis #1: Which seasons are the top ten seasons of Survivor?**

Let’s say you’re interested in the top ten seasons.  The order/ranking of these top ten seasons don’t much matter to you (stick with me, please!).  All you’re interested in right now is the aggregate.  In this case, all votes for a top ten season will count the same…even if someone voted a season as tenth best, it still falls in the top ten range, and counts equally as a season that was voted as the absolute best.  So with that explanation, the top ten seasons based on r/Survivor's votes are:

10) Season 18 (Tocantins – The Brazilian Highlands) – 46 votes  
9) Season 17 (Gabon – Earth’s Last Eden) – 47 votes  
8) Season 1 (Borneo) – 52 votes  
7) Season 13 (Cook Islands) – 55 votes  
6) Season 6 (Amazon) – 60 votes  
5) Season 25 (Philippines) – 68 votes  
3-tie) Season 15 (China) – 82 votes  
3-tie) Season 16 (Micronesia – Fans Vs. Favorites) 82 votes  
2) Season 7 (Pearl Islands) – 83 votes  
1) Season 20 (Heroes vs. Villans) – 85 votes  

Looking at the other end of the spectrum, which ten season received the LEAST amount of votes?

17) Season 9 (Vanuatu – Islands of Fire) – 25 votes  
18-tie) Season 3 (Africa) – 20 votes  
18-tie) Season 4 (Marquesas) – 20 votes  
20-tie) Season 11 (Guatemala – The Mayan Empire) – 18 votes  
20-tie) Season 21 (Nicaragua) – 18 votes  
22) Season 14 (Fiji) – 14 votes  
23) Season 22 (Redemption Island) – 9 votes  
24) Season 24 (One World) – 6 votes  
25) Season 5 (Thailand) – 5 votes  
26) Season 23 (South Pacific) – 4 votes  
  
  
**Analysis #2 – That list is fine and dandy, but it’s fundamentally flawed!  My vote for #1 should NOT carry the same weight as #10!**

Okay, calm down, I’m with you 100% on this!  So lets dive a little deeper into this and weigh the rankings a little bit.  Each vote for top season gets ten points, and each vote for tenth-best season only gets one point (you can do the math in the middle).  Under this method, here’s r/Survivor's weighted top ten:

10) Season 18 (Tocantins – The Brazilian Highlands) – 247 Points  
9) Season 17 (Gabon – Earth's Last Eden) – 269 Points  
8) Season 1 (Borneo) – 279 Points  
7) Season 13 (Cook Islands) – 291 Points  
6) Season 6 (The Amazon) – 301 Points  
5) Season 25 (Philippines) – 324 Points  
4) Season 15 (China) – 480 Points  
3) Season 7 (Pearl Islands) – 507 Points  
2) Season 16 (Micronesia – Fans vs. Favorites) – 609 Points  
1) Season 20 (Heroes vs. Villains) – 662 Points  

As for the bottom ten....

17) Season 9 (Vanuatu – Islands of Fire) – 115 Points  
18) Season 4 (Marquesas) – 109 Points  
19) Season 3 (Africa) – 101 Points  
20) Season 11 (Guatemala – The Mayan Empire) – 76 Points  
21) Season 21 (Nicaragua) – 68 Points  
22) Season 14 (Fiji) – 46 Points  
23) Season 5 (Thailand) – 23 Points  
24) Season 22 (Redemption Island) – 20 Points  
25) Season 24 (One World) – 18 Points  
26) Season 23 (South Pacific) – 9 Points  
  
  
**Analysis #3: Nope, still not buying it.  Ten seasons is way too many to rank.  I bet most of the people who responded haven’t even seen ten full seasons and clicked random ones just so they could fill out the survey.  Your data is flawed!**

I admit, that is certainly a possibility, especially since I forced ten seasons to be ranked in order to submit the poll.  Well, will you buy the argument that everyone who responded at least knows what their top season is?  Alright, so let’s take a look at **just the votes for being top-ranked** and see what the data tells us (too many ties to rank):

**0 votes:** 5 (Thailand), 9 (Vanuatu – Islands of Fire), 14 (Fiji), 21 (Nicaragua), 22 (Redemption Island), 23 (South Pacific), 24 (One World)  
**1 vote:** 2 (The Australian Outback), 3 (Africa), 4 (Marquesas), 11 (Guatamala – The Mayan Empire), 12 (Panama – Exile Island)  
**2 votes:** 6 (The Amazon), 10 (Palau), 19 (Samoa), 26 (Caramoan – Fans vs. Favorites)  
**4 votes:** 8 (All-Stars), 13 (Cook Island), 18 (Tocantins – The Brazilian Highlands), 25 (Philippines)  
**6 votes:** 15 (China)  
**7 votes:** 17 (Gabon – Earth’s Last Eden)  
**11 votes:** 1 (Borneo), 7 Pearl Islands  
**18 votes:** 16 (Micronesia – Fans vs. Favorites), 20 (Heroes vs. Villains)
  
  
**Analysis #4: Wait, what about question 2 on the survey? The one about which season is THE worst one?**

Haven’t forgotten about that one!  Here’s the tally for that question as well:

**0 votes:** 3 (Africa), 6 (The Amazon), 7 (Pearl Islands), 9 (Vanuatu – Islands of Fire), 10 (Palau), 12 (Panama – Exile Island), 15 (China), 16 (Micronesia – Fans vs. Favorites), 20 (Heroes vs. Villains), 25 (Philippines)  
**1 vote:** 1 (Borneo), 2 (The Australian Outback), 8 (All-Stars), 11 (Guatemala – The Mayan Empire), 17 (Gabon – Earth's Last Eden), 18 (Tocantins – The Brazilian Highlands), 19 (Samoa)  
**2 votes:** 4 (Marquesas), 13 (Cook Islands)  
**3 votes:** 14 (Fiji), 26 (Caramoan – Fans vs. Favorites)  
**6 votes:** 21 (Nicaragua)  
**7 votes:** 23 (South Pacific)  
**9 votes:** 5 (Thailand)  
**17 votes:** 24 (One World)  
**42 (!!!) votes:** 22 (Redemption Island)
  
  
**Analysis #5: Screw you and your basic analysis.  Give me the data and I’ll come up with my own conclusions, thank you very much!**

Well, you could have asked in a nicer tone, but sure, here’s the answer matrix from the first question: http://i.imgur.com/ZqRCI5Y.png
  
  
**Analysis #6: Not interested in the raw data anymore.  With the recent events going on, I'd rather go all NSA on this and see exactly where everyone lives who filled out this survey.**

Sure, why not?  I didn’t realize this during original post, but Surveymonkey collected the IP addresses with each submission.  Translating them into cities and towns, here’s a map of where the 100 responses came from: http://tinyurl.com/n5rmo4n Personally I wouldn't be surprised if some IP forwarding was happening (I'm looking at you Mongolia!), but thought it was worth sharing to see the geographical spread of where the responses came from.

For those who don't speak French, a 25-year-old male died of a heart attack on Day 1 of Koh-Lanta (Survivor in France) season 16 in Cambodia. Filming has stopped and the remaining contestants have been flown back to Paris.

I believe this is the second reported death during Survivor; the first case was in the Bulgarian version, however after the man's death, filming continued and the season was finished and aired on schedule.

I could see two ways it could play:


**Option 1: Final 4 Immunity Bribe** -- at the F4 Immunity at some point Jeff could offer the option to walk away from the whole game.  


*""I know each of you has a 1 in 4 shot at winning this game right now but I'm going to make you an offer.  You may be looking at that jury and saying 'there's no way I can win.'  Here's your second chance.  In just a few weeks we're starting Survivor 28 and you can be in that.  Start again.  We won't reveal to your opponents that you were here, that you gained knowledge on how this game is played.""*


If that doesn't work throw in a hidden immunity idol delivered to you on day 3 (or some other advantage).


**Option 2: Can you win both?** -- this option would only work if Burnett/Probst/etc would be willing to reveal the winner during the Final FTC (and not live on stage).  Poll the final 3 before hand and if they think they'd do it read off the votes right then and there, crown the winner, then have Probst say:


*""You are the Sole Survivor.  Now, before I hand you the million dollar check I have a proposition for you.  You could take the million dollars home, enjoy it.  Or you could throw the check into the fire.  In a few weeks we're starting Survivor 28.  We'll give you 250 thousand for winning this game but if you win Survivor 28 we'll up your prize to five million dollars.  We won't tell the next cast that you're playing for a different prize.

Brenda's little outburst about being ""true"" and ""honest""...talk about hypocrisy. She was planning to vote out Cochran *next*. Which is smart. She should be trying to backstab Cochran, because guess what? He's a threat. Just like she was. But don't try to suggest that you're some saint who would never consider voting for an ally.

Last week, she knew that Troyzan was going to use his HII.  She also knew that the plan to split the votes would protect her even if Troyzan used his HII.  But, it would have taken only **one person** to flip their vote to put Kim in danger.  Yet, she had enough confidence to keep the HII in her pocket.

Now this week, again there is a plan to split votes.  By all logic, that should have resulted in a 3 way tie with Kim, Leif and Tarzan all getting 3 votes (of course it didn't, because Tarzan is a moron).  Again, it boils down to just needing **one person** to flip and suddenly Kim is in danger.  And there was no mystery that Troyzan was gunning for her this week, he flat out said it, multiple times, at tribal council.

So obviously Kim is exerting significant control over Alicia and Christina, and perhaps even Tarzan.  From the editing, this makes absolutely no sense.  We've seen nothing to indicate why those 3 would believe they have any type of agreement with Kim (or anyone else) to get to the end.  

Perhaps they are just the complete morons that we think they are, and the explanation is as simple as that.  But **Troyzan has spelled the whole damn thing out to them!**  He *knows* the exact pecking order with Kat #4, Alicia #5, Christina #6 and Tarzan #7.  Even if you're stupid, you can understand shit when someone sits you down and spells it out to you that clearly.

So are we just being trolled by Burnett?  Is there a bigger plan afoot than we've ever been privy to?  I don't really recall Burnett ever completely blindsiding us before, but maybe its our turn.

There wasn't anything truly unique to this season, it was just a straight up game of Survivor. 16 people, no tribe swaps, merge at 10, final 2. This season was a standard game of Survivor.

**The Winner: Richard Hatch**

Episode 1 quote, ""I've got the million dollar check written already, I'm the winner"". Richard Hatch was a fat gay guy who laid the foundation for how the game would forever be played. Early on Richard stressed the importance of the team. He filled the role of food provider which was very valuable in the early seasons. Richard created the first alliance of the game, wiped out the entire opposing tribe,took all four members of his alliance to the final 4, and still maintained jury votes. 

**Characters**

- **Richard**: The FNF, fat naked fag, played a great social, and strategic game. 
- **Kelly**: Was in the alliance, but always struggled with it morally. Won the final 4 immunity challenges to make FTC.
- **Rudy**: Always on the chopping block early for being bossy and abrasive. The island chef who had little strategic game, but he stuck with Rich and the alliance to the end. America loved his attitude back then, at the Caramoan Reunion, not so much.
- **Sue**: The only other real strategic player this season. Lies and goes against her word from day 1. Stays strong with the alliance until the end.
- **Greg**: The ivy league nature goofball. Inventor of the ""nature"" phone. An all around great character, who saw alliances as no fun.
- **Colleen**: America's first Survivor sweetheart. Started playing the game one tribal too late.
- **Gervase**: Completely out of his element. Couldn't really swim, and refused to ever make an alliance.
- **Jenna**: Innocent, and hard working, but never aligns until it is too late. I really like the way she improved from this season to All-Stars.
- **Sean**: The inventor of the ""Super-Poll"" fishing rod. Voted alphabetically, and was in the dark strategically for most of the game.

**Season Summary**

**Start of Game**: This season of Survivor starts with the castaways being able to take anything and everything off the boat. Pretty straight forward, but this is my favorite way to start. Tagi seems to come out a little ahead with all of the fish/rat traps.

**Pre-Merge**: Pre-Merge is mostly a story of people surviving on an island. Almost all time is spent focusing on camp life, with very little to no strategic talk. Votes basically followed the pattern of ""Who do I not like?"". Richard, Sue, and Kelly form the first alliance in Ep4.

**Merge**: The merge at ten has 5 Pagong and 5 Tagi members left. For the first 3 votes after merge the pieces are there to get Rich out, but it just never comes together. After the merge everyone is just one step behind Richard Hatch and his alliance, and it results in the original ""Pagonging"" as the 5 members of Pagong are picked off.

**Final Immunity**: One of my favorite final immunity challenges ever. Stand on a log while keeping your hand on the poll. No skill, just pure willpower. These kind of willpower challenges are used for final immunity in early seasons, but fade away later to more luck/technical challenges. 

**FTC**: A surprisingly unbitter jury(excpet Sue). Seemed like it could fall either way going in. Kelly's answers seem to do little to help her cause, while Rich gives strong answers to support his game. The deciding vote comes down to Greg. The Pagong jury members see Rich as evil for making alliances and all vote Kelly, who was younger and they related with better. The Tagi jury members stay loyal to their leader Rich. Greg asks the question ""pick a number 1-10"". He later says it had no effect and he was voting Rich the whole time. Whatever the influence was, he was the deciding vote.

**Craziest/Funniest Moments**

- Gretchen and BB start fire with glasses on day 2. Something contestants still struggle with in current seasons.
- Greg invents the nature phone, using a coconut to communicate.
- Greg builds some highly efficient rat traps, and the Pagong members dine on rat.
- Greg builds his ""bachelor bird nest"" that he sleeps in on the side.
- Richard Hatch walks around naked.
- Gervase makes the comment, ""women are the stupidest things on the planet next to cows"", Joel gets associated and is voted out.
- The first vote after the merge, has a crazy 4-1-1-1-1-1-1 split with Gretchen going home. The most diverse vote in Survivor history.
- Jenna doesn't get a video from home. This was actually pretty sad.
- Colleen, Jenna, and Kelly invent wearing the buff as a skirt/top.
- Greg's fake crying exit after being voted off.
- The first Pagonging. A tribes extinction has only happened like this two other times with the Sook Jai tribe of Thailand, and the mutinied Raratonga tribe from Cook Islands.
- Sue's FTC speech about Snakes and Rats. Classic and still one of the best ever.

**What if/Why Moments**

- Why did everyone consider alliances unethical? Everyone eventually realizes it is the way to play the game, they just do so one vote too late.
- What if Sean didn't vote based on alphabetical order? This really comes into play Ep9. Kelly disbands from the alliance and throws a rogue vote at Sean. Colleen, Jenna, Gervase vote Rich. Rich, Sue, Rudy vote Jenna. Alphabetically it is Sean's turn to vote for Jenna, but he repeatedly says he will change if he senses she is in trouble. He votes for Jenna, eliminating her. Even in the voting booth he says ""Maybe you will get 1 or 2 votes but nothing major. After this vote Sean realizes his voting strategy might be dumb.
- At 7, what if everyone rallies vs Rich, Sue, and Rudy. This was sort of the last chance numbers wise, and things were lining up. Kelly was feeling immoral being in an alliance, and was on edge with Sue for growing closer to Pagong. Unfortunately, Sean and Gervasse still weren't 100% convinced their was an alliance going on.
- What if Kelly takes Rudy to FTC or what if Rudy wins final immunity. Personally, I think Kelly wins vs Rudy. I think Rich still wins if Rudy takes him. 

**Underlying Themes**

- **Greg &amp; Colleen**: It was the first hint at a romance on Survivor. The two later claimed to have played it up, but pre-merge their friendship was a major focus of Pagong.
- **Alliances**: The word first surfaces in Ep4 as Rich, Sue, and Kelly team up. The majority of the cast sees this as unethical, and immoral. Kelly who is in the dominate alliance often has second thoughts and claims it makes the game no fun. Everyone eventually realizes alliances are necessary, but it is too late.
- **Who would go home next?**: In 2000 when this was live, America was hooked. It was a national phenomenon and people were seriously interested in who was voted off each week.

**Interesting Season Notes**

- Castaways get a little bit more luxuries in early seasons including, sunglasses, personal items right away, and other comforts.
- Fire was rewarded in the form of water-proof matches not flint.
- The first reward challenge didn't happen until Ep3.
- The word alliance isn't mentioned until Ep4.
- Jeff doesn't throw his arms up and shout ""X wins immunity!""

**Controversial Topics**

- It has been rumored that producers pushed for Rudy to stay in the game longer, going as far as telling contestants how to vote. I think I have heard pretty sufficient evidence against this, but in a game for $1,000000 it is a big deal.
- Gervase is given a floating device to help him swim in an early immunity challenge. I am not sure if this would fly nowadays. Hope he learned to swim for Blood vs Water.

**Overall Season Rating**

In my opinion this season is great, and still stands as one of the best. It is important to see where it all began and see how the show and the game have evolved over 27 seasons. It definitely has a more documentary feel to it then newer seasons, but it is still riveting to watch. For me Richard Hatch ranks somewhere in the top 10 of Survivor winners. He played a style of game that was perfectly suited for an early season, but that would still be practical today. He was an all around good player who had strong social game, smart strategy, good camp work ethic, and smooth tribal answers. He dominated his season from start to finish and was a very deserving winner.

Both what was said by whom, and how the whispering - along with the vote - affects people's games go forward [Spoilers, duh]",42,6,41,http://www.reddit.com/r/survivor/comments/1cltqo/lets_talk_about_the_whispering_at_tribal_council/,"**Who targeted whom in the scramble**

Based upon what other in the thread say, I'll update this.  I didn't rewatch at all, so I know I missed a lot.  Brenda is really the only one I remember, but I know someone threw out Phillip's name as well.

**Brenda** - Clearly was targeting Andrea.  And the editing showed it several times, so it seems reasonable that divide is an important foreshadow for the rest of the game.

**Dawn** - Seemed to be ok voting for Andrea, but ""couldn't get to them over there"".  So no idea who else she was trying to bring into that plan.

**Cochran** - ??

**Phillip** - Originally suggest Andrea to Brenda, then later said they should just vote the way they originally planned to flush the HIIs.

**Erik** - Ended up voting for ~~Phillip~~ Fillup, so presumably he was on board with voting Phil from the start.

**Andrea** - ""Phillip, we have to"".

**Sherri** - ??

*******************

**How was everyone's game affected by last night's TC?**

**Brenda** - It may just be wishful thinking, but I think she emerges as one of the big winners.  She now seems solid with Dawn.  She also sees Andrea as a rival and, with Phillip gone, Andrea loses a lot of her power.

**Dawn** - Still hard to tell.  Cochran made a comment about reassessing whether she would be a good one to take to the end.  I still think she is too well liked (although I have no idea why) for anyone to want to take her to the end, but having the strong bond with Brenda; on top of the existing bond with Cochran, puts her in reasonably good positin.

**Cochran** - I don't think his game has changed at all from last night.  He continues to be able to run surprisingly under the radar, but I can't see how *anyone* would want to take him to the end.  I still think he's a solid #4 / #5.

**Erik** - I don't think we can read anything into his vote for Fillup.  I think he was just sick of Phil and was ready for him to be gone. Despite that vote (and the previews for next week), I see no reason to think that Erik would join the Brolliance.  His best bet continues to be to get rid of the Brolliance and try to make an immunity run to the end.  I don't think anyone on the island dislikes him, but his social game is completely lacking in that he hasn't made a strong bond with anyone - and seems incapable of doing so.

**Andrea** - Besides Phillip, she was the big loser last night.  Going into last night, I had her ranked as the #1 power player.  But with her biggest ally gone, she's lost a lot of her power.  Combine that with Brenda clearly targeting her - and having Dawn to go along with her - and Andrea is in trouble.  Her best long-term game plan is to try to replace Phillip in Sherri's life.

**Sherri** - She's still just a pawn with a reasonable chance to get to the end, but little chance of winning it.  But, whether she knows it or not, I think she was lucky to survive last night's vote.  I *think* Malcolm's plan (or at least hope) was that SrU would turn on Sherri when they realized Eddie wouldn't be going home. She would be a fairly obvious target since she was a late addition.  Malcom was hoping SrU would move in that direction, allowing him to keep both HIIs and not play them.  Since it didn't work out that way, Sherri ""won"" in the sense that she didn't go home, but she is still unlikely to go anywhere in the game.

**Brolliance** - Last night was a hail mary that didn't score a touchdown and, instead, resulted in a 14 yard completion across the middle.  The touchdown would have been getting rid of Phillip *and* keeping the 2 HIIs.  Obviously they're going to try to recruit Erik and Sherri, but being down 6-3, their days are numbered.  To stay in the game, they need an immunity run (either challenge or HII).  If possible, Reynold and Malcolm will be the first to go.  If that happens, and Eddie is the last Bro standing, it could mean interesting things for both his game and Andrea's game.

******************

**Bold Prediction**

I think Brenda, Dawn &amp; Cochran are going to FTC.  *Maybe* swap out Sherri for Cochran if Dawn is willing to turn on him and take a patsy.  And that is going to be an incredibly interesting FTC.  The conventional viewer wisdom would be that Brenda hasn't been playing the game and wouldn't attract a lot of votes.  However, I'm going to read into this season's editing a bit, and argue that's wrong.

This season has been edited to be all about **Stealth**-R-Us.  If Brenda is able to remain in **Stealth** mode for 28+ days and then start maneuvering things to get to the end, I think she's got some strong arguments to make to the Jury.  That, combined with the overall **stealth** theme this season, and her **stealth** game, makes me think she may have a much better chance that we've been lead to believe.",,False,self,t5_2qhu3,1366300349.0,,Brenda,True,t3_1cltqo,http://www.reddit.com/r/survivor/comments/1cltqo/lets_talk_about_the_whispering_at_tribal_council/,

Seeing their names in this iconic sequence was almost like a sacred thing.  One of the things that really sets this show apart is that it has a *history*...that even the ""bad"" seasons or the ""boring"" characters matter, because they become part of the lore.  The continuity.  The opening credit sequence always cemented that for me.  It's heroic.

Also, an no less importantly, it matters for the viewer logistically.  There are ***a lot*** of characters to keep up with each season.  I honestly can't remember most of their names without the opening sequence.  I've watched the latest season diligently, but for the life of me I can't remember the majority of the contestant's names, unless it is strange (like a ""Troyzan"") or they get tons of screen time.

I listened to this year-old podcast from Amazon's Rob Cesternino and Tocantins' Stephen Fishbach  in which they fielded suggestions on how to ""fix"" Survivor. You can listen here:

http://www.podfeed.net/episode/The+First+Ever+Survivor+Think+Tank+-+Stephen+Fishbach+on+How+to+Fix+Survivor/3447795

Their favorite suggestion was a recommendation based on a twist from a foreign version of Survivor: ""The Black Vote"", in which the person voted out each week is allowed to cast a vote against one person toward the next vote that the person in question is at tribal council. Fishbach loved the idea but felt it would only work if the remaining castaways knew who the evictee cast the ""Black Vote"" for following tribal council, in effect creating new strategies where castaways would attempt to stack votes against a target, knowing that they have a black vote cast against them.

In all honesty, I think it's a solid idea that's worth at least one season, especially after RI got two. 

But what other suggestions would you have for doing a unique season of Survivor?

Here are my four:

1) Honestly, I think a classic season of Survivor would be as novel as any of the gimmicks. No hidden immunity idols, two tribes of eight, merge at ten, seven-person jury, final two, more survival-based challenges like the old S.O.S. challenge, etc. 

2) It's an individual game from the start, with all the castaways living on one beach, as in One World.

3) A season of pre-merge boots. It's hardly an original idea, but there are a lot of interesting personalities that got kicked way too early. 

4) An off-shoot of #2, and possibly more workable within the framework of reality TV storytelling/editing: it's an individual game from the start, as the survivors live on the same beach for the first day or two. At the first immunity challenge, they draw eggs. Whichever castaways have the red eggs are the captains, and they lead off a schoolyard pick, where each chosen person then picks the next person for their team.

The challenge goes on as expected, and the winning team advances to  the individual stage of the competition where it's every man for himself. This creates an element of challenge in the schoolyard pick. You want to choose well enough to win the team portion, but not so well that you doom your own chance of winning the individual portion. This also has the byproduct of revealing the pecking order within an alliance, as you're not always going to be able to accommodate your friends. It can also force disparate figures in the game to work together. 

However, if that's not workable, then here's an alternative:

An individual game that's played in 3-day increments. On the first day, everyone chooses a buff, and that's their tribe for three days. On the day after immunity and tribal, everyone meets on the beach to choose buffs again. It's a game in which tribes are constantly reshuffling, potentially throwing alliances into chaos and changing the balance of physical power in challenges, avoiding Pagonging by keeping tribes in flux. 

What do you think? And what suggestions would you make as a Survivor producer to change the game?",,False,self,t5_2qhu3,False,,,True,t3_1dq2ny,http://www.reddit.com/r/survivor/comments/1dq2ny/what_ideas_for_a_season_have_never_been_done/,

For those who have no problem with him or his comments, a distraction from the show we have come together to discuss is gone. 

For those who have personally argued or taken exception with him or his comments, on behalf of the remaining mods, I sincerely apologize. 

Moving forward, I will be the one in charge of day to day operations. 

***To be clear:*** No post will ever be removed simply because I, or the other mods, disagree with it's content or message. The job of the mods is to protect the community from spoilers and spam and to make little tweaks to the reddit community to provide a more pleasant user experience as a whole. 

I will take time to intervene and step in when the situation calls for it. But these situations will be handled on a case by case basis and the ultimate solution will be decided upon unanimously between the active moderators. I will strive to be as transparent as possible and explain any and all controversial actions taken. 

***If you have any issues with anything at all, please contact me and it will be sorted out civilly and without issue.*** 

Moving on to the second topic, I'd like to officially open up applications for new moderators. 

This is a genuinely fantastic community with almost 2,500 subscribers and very few overall issues. 

The main responsibilities of said person will be to fish stories out of the spam folder, enforce spoiler policies, and generally keep the peace and maintain civil discussion. 

I'm not looking for anyone wanting secretly to abuse their power because I'm not afraid to admit I was wrong in judging someone's character. You will operate mainly behind the scenes and forgo your opportunity to make salacious comments and hold personal grudges. 

Do not apply if you are sensitive to spoilers - I have seen every perceivable spoiler at this point and am numb to hearing that Boston Rob is taking over as host next season. Most of them are untrue and hilariously wrong, but you still must be exposed to them every time you look at the banned user list. 

If you are still interested, please message the moderators and tell us why you think you would be a good candidate for this job. I'm leaving it fairly open ended on purpose because I love surprises. 

Thank you for all who have read this and contributed without issue these past few seasons.

First we were introduced to idols, then Yau-Man came up with the fake idol concept. Where could we go from here?

Here's my plan. If I was on survivor and found the idol, I would craft a fake idol if possible and then hold a tribe meeting where I announce that I found the idol. My speech would go something like this:

""I've seen enough past seasons of Survivor to know that the idol paints a big target on the back of whoever finds it. I don't want that cloud of suspicion around me and I want to play a straight-up game so I'm going to play the idol at our next tribal council and be done with it.""

Of course, I'd show everyone the fake idol. At the next tribal I'd play the fake idol and feign surprise at finding out that it wasn't real. I think that this would benefit my game in several ways:

1. Ensure safety for one tribal council because everyone thinks that I'm playing the idol.

2. Make everyone think that I definitely do not have the idol.

3. Raise suspicion of everyone else in the tribe because it seems as if someone found the idol, planted a fake idol, and didn't tell anyone about it.

4. Build trust within the tribe. I could go around the next day asking everyone if they knew anything about the fake idol and then assuring them that I believed them 100% when they deny involvement. Which would be true.

&gt;First and foremost, production spoilers are not allowed anywhere on /r/survivor, and **posting a production spoiler will result in a ban**. A production spoiler is information regarding a boot order, final 3, or other events that allegedly occur on an unaired season or episode. Please also avoid referencing that you have seen production spoilers elsewhere since that can sometimes be a spoiler itself.

&gt;After an episode airs on Wednesday, **do not submit links or discussions with spoilers in the title until the following Monday**. If you submit an image that might spoil people, mark it NSFW to hide the thumbnail until Monday. Comments may contain spoilers, so do not click on them until you are caught up to the current episode or don't mind being spoiled.

&gt;If you have not seen an older season, beware that you may see spoilers for it if you are reading discussions here. If you want to decide which past season to watch next without getting spoiled, visit [The Spoiler-Free Guide to Past Seasons](http://www.reddit.com/r/survivor/comments/10tpq9/the_unofficial_spoilerfree_rank_and_discuss_past/).

The goal is to give everyone 5 days to catch up on the current episode without being spoiled by titles or thumbnails in their main feed.

Essentially this would be achieved by taking out all footage in which the winner isn't present. You would see their confessionals, any scenes where they are present with other tribe mates, all the challenges, all the deleted scenes, and all tribal councils that involve the winner.

I could do this retroactively, but I'm trying to decide which season would be best for this. I'd like it to be a season where the winner has a lot of face time and has to pull some crazy strategical punches.

What do you think, is this a good idea, or not really worth my time? If it's a good idea we can talk logistics below.

What’s your take on this? Should jury members be sequestered from each other like before the game starts, or is group jury talk just something that players at the end should be factoring into their gameplay all along?


**Jeff Probst: If it was logistically possible to sequester everybody on the jury, we would do it in a heartbeat. Ba-bump. That fast. But it’s just not something we can pull off. It’s too expensive and we’d need 8 separate places to keep them. Not gonna happen in the middle of the South China Sea! Yes, it impacts the game and probably not always in a good way.

- Surprise start. Contestants are tricked into starting with only the clothes on their back. More on this below.

- Looting rewards. The tribe that wins reward gets to pillage one item from the losing teams camp. 

- Outcast Tribe. The first six people voted off return to compete in an immunity challenge on day 19. By winning the challenge two Outcasts are voted back into the game by their fellow Outcast tribe members. 

**The Winner: Sandra Diaz-Twine**

- Note: In season 20 Sandra goes on to become the first and only two time winner of Survivor.

Here are some quotes to give insight into Sandra's strategy...

- ""I'm just glad it's not me...Let them duke it out...let them kill eachother off. As long as it aint Sandra I'm happy.""

- ""She'd vote out her best friend or her worst enemy. She would go to the next level with five people she hated, just to get to that next level...with her there's no, 'I have feelings for this person' or 'I don't know if we should do that'. She doesn't care. She says 'If I'm staying in the game, I'll vote for them.'""

- ""There are always bigger fish to fry...if someone needed that extra vote, I was there. Always there to take advantage of a situation, and let the vote go in a different direction than my way.""

Sandra is the only hispanic to ever win Survivor, and did so without ever receiving a vote against. Sandra's ability to always make herself not this vote, but the next vote, can not be overlooked. Consistently buying herself three more days led to new opportunities for further progression in the game. Sandra is also one of the most underrated speakers. She can lie and create a convincing story without thinking twice, as well as deliver smart tribal council answers. Her ability to speak spanish immediately helped her tribe. This, and her tribes early dominance took away any threat of her being eliminated early due to being physically weak. Sandra forms the tightest pre-merge alliance with Christa and Rupert, and is never in danger of going home. Sandra is able to stay in the majority until Rupert's blindside at 8 left. IMO this is where Sandra truly shines and puts to rest any notion of coattail riding. 

**Characters**

- **Sandra**: A complete non-factor at challenges, but made up for it socially/strategically. The founder of the ""as long as it's not me"" strategy.

- **Lil**: Eliminated third, but voted back in by the Outcasts. Ridiculed for wearing the boy scout uniform. Sure she was naive, but she was sincere and you had to feel bad for her at times. She woke up at the end strategically and was one wrong decision away from winning.

- **Jonny Fairplay**: A masterful liar and manipulator. He did an excellent job at keeping his closest ally, Burton, around. The whole time he is playing up his 'Fairplay' brand, but whatever it is funny! He gets in fights, has great confessionals, and actually played the game very well. Lied about his grandma dying.

- **Darrah**: Lazy around camp, and on the outside after the merge with Tijuana. She goes on an amazing three immunity run to earn final four.

- **Burton**: Thought he was the leader of Drake, but instead he was the first to go. Voted back in by the Outcasts. After merge he has a strong alliance with JF and Lil. He tries to be the good cop to JF's bad cop and it was working for awile. 

- **Christa**: Tight alliance with Rupert and Sandra, but when they lose power she is next to go.

- **Rupert**: One of the most well liked Survivor's ever. He took on the role as Drake's leader and preached for Drake unity. Tried to use the strategy of ""I'm the food provider, you can't live without me"" which was good for awhile, but he got too comfortable and trusted the wrong people for too long.

- **Savage**: The leader of Morgan and there best strategic player. Wanted to always keep the strongest members around. He really let the Outcast twist effect his game and it cost him. He also wore his suit blazer during confessionals which was pretty cool.

**Season Summary**

**Start of Game**: Surprise! The game is starting and you only get the clothes on your back. Each tribe is also given 100 Balboas (~$100) to purchase any necessary supplies at a local village. Sandra is the only person who can speak spanish and it gives Drake a huge advantage. Morgan is scattered everywhere with no plan and leave their raft unattended, and Rupert steals their shoes. Sandra is able to trade her gold necklace for large amounts of chicken and other cooking supplies. In the end Drake comes out with fishing line, hooks, fishing spear, rice, beans, fruit, 2 live chickens, booze, tarp, 2 machetes, 2 large water containers, lanterns, kerosene, and 2 cooking pots. This actually equates to more starting supplies than any tribe has ever received. Morgan on the other hand gets no where near as much and leaves the village before spending all of their money. Best start ever!

**Pre-Merge**: Savage, Osten, Ryan O, Darrah, and Tijuana control the majority at Morgan. Burton, Shawn, and Michele think they are the majority at Drake, but actually Rupert, Sandra, Christa, JF, and Trish have the early power. Morgan's camp life is a mess. They are lazy around camp, and have to rebuild shelter four times after continuously putting it in dumb places. Drake dominates early by winning the first six challenges in total. The Morgan votes are easy and based around strength. The camp raids continued to further decimate Morgan as they lost their tarp and water pot. Then Drake threw the seventh challenge, which leads to 4 straight immunity losses and puts the tribes even in numbers at the merge.

**Merge**: The Outcasts are voted back in just before the merge, and are immune at the first tribal council. Lil immediately flips on Morgan, eliminating Savage, and giving Drake the power. With 8 left, JF rallies the remaining Morgan and Burton to blindside Rupert. This gives Fairplay, Burton, Lil, and Darrah control until 5 when the three remaining women take out Burton. Basically a completely unaligned, stand alone final four. It's blindside after blindside and alliances are only temporary. This is the first season that every single person is really trying hard to win the game. 

**Final Immunity**: Balance on a raft in the ocean using your hands and feet. A nice mix of focus and endurance. Sandra quickly drops out and JF immediately tries to strike a deal with Lil, but Lil shuts him down. He keeps trying to get her to accept a deal as he knows he can not win the challenge, but she won't do it. After two hours Lil wins.

**FTC**: A semi bitter jury, but the 6-1 vote says this was pretty much decided as soon as Lil took Sandra instead of JF. Lil just had no gameplay to stand on. She tried to focus on her camp work ethic, and her kindness towards others, but she was criticized for riding coattails as well as not properly representing the boy scouts. Sandra stands by her strategy, saying she has no regrets, and that she was her own player. Lil's questions and answers continuously come back to her wearing her scout uniform and she even admits to riding coattails, being weak, and having a bunch of regrets. In Lil's final remarks she finally stands up for herself and tells the jury off for their heavy criticism. Sandra has a strong answer for every question and scoffs at the accusation of riding coattails saying ""Rupert was gone early. Who did I ride? I'm here not them.""

**Funniest/Craziest Moments**

- Osten tries to start the adventure with two bottles of alcohol.

- Osten suggests Nicole and Tijuana flash the local merchants for money at the fishing village.

- Morgan tribe sprints up and down beach looking for perfect camp site.

- Burton opens a coconut and only shares with Shawn and Michelle.

- Morgan tribe doesn't use their map and wanders around looking for water.

- Drake tribe modifies their clothes. Rupert makes a skirt from Christa's dress. Sandra makes shoes from leaves. Burton and Shawn continually rip on Rupert about his dress.

- Morgan men get naked at first challenge.

- First loot reward Sandra decided to take Morgan tarp. They tell her ""take it down yourself"", won't let her use their knives, and then get mad saying she is wrecking their shelter.

- Shawn loses the fishing spear head. Rupert is pissed.

- Drake finds the buried treasure, but everything in it is moldy/smelly. They do find chocolate candy inside though.

- Burton, Shawn, and Michelle throw the immunity challenge because they think they are in charge of Drake. Burton goes home. 

- Fairplay goes to tribal drunk.

- Michele is supposed to act like she can't do the gross food challenge, instead she dominates it and then gets voted off.

- Rupert takes care of his pet snake Balboa until it dies. 

- A pelican strolls into the Morgan camp and Osten freaks out and wants to kill it.

- JF and Shawn get in numerous fights over Shawn's work ethic at camp.

- Osten quits on day 19. First time someone had ever quit.

- Burton and Lil are voted back in on day 19. First time contestants have ever returned after being voted out.

- Savage gets taste of his own medicine when he asks Lil, ""Will you let me know beforehand?"". Lil had asked him the same thing the night she was voted out and he never got back to her.

- After Rupert is voted out, Sandra throws the fish he caught into the jungle. Everyone blames Christa.

- JF lies about his grandmother dying.

- Sandra eavesdrops on people's conversations from the bushes several times. She brings Tijuana with her one time to over hear JF and Burton talking final 3 plans that go against what they had promised her and Darrah.

- At word scramble immunity challenge, Burton is wrongly awarded immunity. Challenge restarts and Darrah wins. This is the fist time Jeff wrongly awarded a challenge win.

- Sandra hides all the water cans, nets, machets, knives, pick axe, spear, and goggles. 

- Burton wins reward at 5 and take JF because he would be more fun, leaving the three women alone at camp.

- At the reunion JF says, ""During All-Stars maybe my grandpa will die"" to very mixed reactions.

**What if/Why Moments**

- Why does Trish try to get Rupert out pre-merge? It was too early. They still needed him for food and challenges. Trish was even in the majority with him. She could have done nothing and made the merge.

- Why does Rupert believe Lil is with him so easily? After he knew JF and Burton were plotting something, and had just buttered her up after reward. He takes her word and leaves the issue alone. He could have easily guilt tripped her into staying with him.

- What if Burton and JF stay with Darrah and Lil? They had final four in place and it would mean Sandra was gone at 5. Instead the guys want to turn on Darrah, which ultimately leads to Burton going home. I think seeing this through was the best chance Burton and JF had at making final two together.

- Why does Burton take Fairplay on reward with him at 5? The answer is Burton was sick of going on rewards with people he didn't like and thought Jon would be more fun. At this point Lil still wants Burton and her to the end, but by choosing Jon to go on reward he leaves Lil back at camp with Sandra and Darrah. Just prior to this him and JF also told Lil they wanted to betray Darrah which didn't sit well with her. The women finally get Lil to think strategically and get on board to vote Burton out. Burton and Lil have a talk at night and Lil asks him if they are still on for final two. Instead of lying and reassuring her (which he has been doing all along) he responds with, ""I don't like to think that far ahead."" 

- What if Lil takes Fairplay to FTC? Lil is almost guaranteed to win. This was the biggest mistake since Colby not taking Kieth and it cost her.

1357617779.0,29,self.survivor,165wq8,Let's find out who people consider to be the best Survivor contestant.,38,9,312,http://www.reddit.com/r/survivor/comments/165wq8/lets_find_out_who_people_consider_to_be_the_best/,"I was just curious as to who /r/Survivor considers to be the best Survivor contestant overall, so I thought I'd organize what I feel like is a fun way of finding out. Here's how this will work:


I will post each season of Survivor as individual comments and people will reply to each season comment with their own personal favorite contestant from that season. If you see your favorite, upvote them. I will take the top 3 from each season and add them to a bracket which I will post and everyone can vote on. I'll post the link to the bracket in this post and in its own post so it can be easily found.


Here are a few rules to keep this simple and civilized. 

* Please include the full names of contestants that you are nominating. If they have a nickname, please include that as well. 

* Your downvotes will have no affect on the outcome. I will be picking the top contestants based solely on how many upvotes they have (I have RES so I can see how many upvotes/downvotes a post receives.) **Ignore this. See EDIT 3 as to why. I'm just keeping this here so people who previously posted will know it changed**

* Only players from their original seasons can be nominated. All-Stars and HvV will not be options to nominate from and for the seasons with new and veteran players (Guatemala, Micronesia, Redemption Island, South Pacific, and Philippines) only the new players can be nominated.

* If you wish to give a reason behind why your nomination should be upvoted make it a reply to the nomination post and do not include it in the nomination post itself. Example of what not to do given by /u/pshah1225: JT because he's hawt. (The comment's logic would deserve a downvote, but then you still may think JT is a worthy competitor)




I will wait a few days for the votes to come in and then I will get the bracket set up. 

EDIT: Please feel free to base your nominations off of the contestants games in all seasons they take part in, but only nominate them in their original season. The only reason I chose to keep returning players in season from getting nominations was to give every contestant an even chance of being nominated. So nominate based on all of the games they've played, but they can only be nominated in one post to keep it fair.

EDIT 2: If you see your favorite already listed, feel free to add another favorite of yours in addition to upvoting your first choice. Surely there's more than one contestant from each season that you liked. Let's see how intense we can get this competition.

EDIT 3: It was brought to my attention by /u/Alley-0op that the upvote/downvote ratio shown in RES isn't entirely reliable, so, downvote away nominations you don't want in the running. Final selections will have to be based on upvote/downvote ratio after all. Sorry for the misinformation.

EDIT 4: You should also check out the thread organized by /u/pshah1225. It's basically the same thing we're doing here but it's for the most entertaining Survivor contestant. http://www.reddit.com/r/survivor/comments/1669lk/lets_find_out_who_people_consider_to_be_the_most/

EDIT 5: I think it's time to start making the bracket. The votes seem to be trickling in and the nominations have stopped altogether. I'm officially calling the nomination period as over. Your choices will be input into a bracket and you will have the option of voting between pairs of contestants, who will be paired up randomly to avoid any bias at all on my part. I want to keep this as fair and unbiased as possible.

1372543981.0,28,self.survivor,1hbzhn,Survivor 3 Africa Breakdown,39,11,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/survivor/comments/1hbzhn/survivor_3_africa_breakdown/,"**New Twists**

The first ever tribe swap! On day 13 three members from each of the tribes are switched, resulting in the biggest Survivor twist ever at this point. The tribe swap soon becomes a norm, but this is the one that shook things up first. 

**The Winner: Ethan Zohn**

Ethan was a very solid all around player. He was handsome, athletic, and nice to everyone which led to him never being on the chopping block. Ethan joined forces with Lex and Tom and day 2 to form this seasons most powerful alliance. At the tribe switch Ethan is isolated away from his alliance members, but is fine until they are reunited at the merge. Ethan doesn't have any big moves in particular that put him in the FTC, but played smart the whole 39 days. Of the three members of his alliance he was the one loyal to both. When Tom and Lex turned on each other in the end, Ethan stayed safe in the middle. Ethan also brought back a box of cookies from a reward for the tribe. This scored huge brownie points at the time.

**Characters**

- **Ethan**: Good looking and really nice. Once he got in the power alliance he was never in jeopardy.

- **Kim J**: Her game was all about staying loyal to the original Boran tribe. That and winning the final two immunity challenges got her into the FTC. 
- **Lex**: The leader of the Boran tribe. Formed the power alliance with Ethan and Tom on day 2. Did a good job forming bonds with everybody, but seemed to wear on everyone towards the end. Won 5 of 6 challenges at one point, including the car.
- **Big Tom**: Everyone's favorite goat farmer. You could only understand half of what he said, but it was always hilarious. Big Tom's Survivor strategy: Get into a strong threesome on day 1, and ride it to the very end. The problem is Tom eventually gets caught scheming both times.
- **Teresa ""T-Bird""**: So nice, and actually very strategic. She was trying to create new opportunities for herself the entire game. It got her fifth despite being in a tough spot from the beginning.
- **Kim Powers**: This seasons cutie. Originally a part of the lazy young Samburu, she got better after the merge. She tried to play strategic, but couldn't get the numbers.
- **Frank**: The military man who was on his own safari. Had no social game, but a funny relationship with Brandon.
- **Lindsey**: The leader of the lazy young Samburu tribe, and a total bitch. Made necklaces for her young alliance.

**Season Summary**

**Start of Game**: Here are all of your supplies, take what you want and hike to camp. The Boran tribe decide to only take 2 out of 3 water jugs, and quickly decide to dump all of the water out. On the hike, Samburu breaks almost all of their water gords/pots which really hinders them pre-merge.

**Pre-Merge**: Samburu is instantly split 4v4 by age and work ethic. Meanwhile Lex, Ethan, and Tom form their alliance on day 2. Boran votes are easy based on 2 members dehydrating. Samburu's first vote is deadlocked and comes down to the first and only quiz tiebreaker. Carl goes home putting the young Samburu in a power position.

**Tribe Swap**: Day 13 has the first ever tribe swap. Silas is instantly screwed being on the new Boran tribe with Frank and T-Bird. Lex, Tom, and Kelly get to the Samburu camp and are like ""wtf have you guys been doing here?!"" Lex, Tom, and Kelly are able to learn that Lindsey has past votes against her and when the votes are deadlocked at tribal, that becomes the difference. 

**Merge**: The merge starts with 6 original Boran members and 4 original Samburu, and this proves the difference as the Samburu members can never gain any control. Lex, Tom, Ethan, and Kim J make up the dominant 4 and dictate most votes. It looks shaky at times, but they do manage to get it to a Boran final 4.

**Final Immunity**: Stand with one leg on each stump while keeping a hand on the idol. Survivor reuses this as a final immunity challenge several times. I do like this challenge as it is almost solely about focus and willpower. Kim wins and takes Ethan to FTC.

**FTC**: Definitely seems to favor Ethan going in, and it results in the biggest win of the first three seasons, 5-2. Kim is targeted as having ridden coattails to get there. Ethan preaches how he maintained his integrity while being a nice guy. Not sure if there is a swing vote. Kelly went with the ""pick a number between 1-1000 question"". If Kim gets that right, the swing becomes Lex who had a close relationship with both finalists. Ethan seemed to have had this wrapped up though.

**Craziest/Funniest Moments**

- Samburu creates fire on day 2 from a telescope lense that is included in the first aid kit. Meanwhile Boran fails to realize they have the same supplies.

- Clarence takes two cherries instead of one.

- Clarence stays at camp to take care of a dehydrated Diane while everyone else goes to the waterhole. While away Clarence opens a can of beans for him and Diane. The tribe is furious, and while his physical ability buys him some time, this event sealed his fate.

- The first Samburu tribal is deadlocked 4v4, old vs young. With no previous votes to go off of the tiebreaker becomes a survival quiz. Lindsey wins sending Carl home.

- The young Samburu ask the older tribe members to vote for Lindsey since she already has previous votes against her. The older members instead target Silas as a big screw you.

- Lindsey is suffering from dehydration and Linda walks up on her. Not to make fun of her pain, but their hate relationship makes this funny.

- Big Tom &amp; Lex remove a tick from Lindsey's ass.

- In the first immunity challenge after the tribal swap, Boran throws the challenge for the first time in Suvivor history to protect their friends on the Samburu tribe.

- Clarence gives the chickens an ultimatum, lay an egg by the morning or die. The chickens delivers, but they eat it anyway.

- Frank tries to communicate with an elephant by swinging his arms and canteen.

- The tribal Clarence gets voted out, T-Bird votes for Lex, sending Lex on a rampage the next day. By next tribal, Lex has decided Kelly cast the vote against him and decides to send her home.

- Big Tom gets a massive boil on his neck.

- Frank &amp; Brandon win a movie dinner date reward.

- At the auction Ethan and Tom combine money to win a mystery item that is pancakes, bacon, and ham. Tom shouts ""He's a Jew! He's a Jew, he won't eat the ham!""

- Kim J bathes downstream from elephant poop and Tom has some funny confessionals commenting on it.

- Tom has some funky smelling feet/boots.

- At tribal Lex refers to being voted out as ""a walk of shame"". The next tribal Kelly, on the jury, shows up wearing a shirt that reads ""Shameless"".

- Tom's FTC question of ""If a hyena walks into our camp, eats the food, and then licks his butt...why did he just lick his butt?""

**What if/ Why Moments**

- What if Kim J is voted off in ep3 or ep4? She cost her team in challenges early by being older. If Boran loses an immunity she is the one on the chopping block. 
- Why does Brandon vote with Boran and send Kelly home? At 9 people left, Lex is on a witch hunt to eliminate ""the snake"" that voted for him. He decides it's Kelly and does his noble thing of telling her she is going home. Kelly then defects over to the remaining Samburu 4 and put themselves in a position to take out Lex that night. At tribal Brandon votes for Kelly instead sending her home, all because he refused to work with Frank. 
- What if Kim J flips at 7 and goes with the remaining Samburu to eliminate Lex and his alliance? This is one of T-Bird's many strategies to try and advance herself. She had a lot of good ideas, and had Samburu ever gained control she could of easily made FTC. Unfortunately for her, no one ever took the bait.
- What if Lex doesn't win immunity at 5? Tom and Lex's relationship is starting to boil over, and T-Bird seems to have Kim J and Tom in place to get Lex out. Another T-Bird plan that gets her into FTC if it works out.
- What if Lex and Kim join Teresa to vote Tom off at 5? After Lex wins immunity Teresa tells Lex how Tom has floated his name around, but once again Boran stays loyal. So close for Teresa on so many different tries.
- What if Kim takes Lex to FTC, or what if one of the guys wins final immunity. I think Lex might win vs Kim J by getting the votes of Ethan, Tom, Teresa, and Brandon. If either guy wins final immunity they both eliminate Kim. In FTC I think Ethan comes out ahead as everyone liked him, while people grew impatient of Lex at the end.

**Underlying Themes**

- **It's Africa!**: The contestants are constantly reminded of their harsh locale over the season. This season has more dehydration incidents than most with Diane, Jessie, and Lindsey all falling apart. Lions stalk the bomas on several occasions and Boran runs into a Cape Buffalo on the way back to camp. The lack of good water and food sources does seem to effect the social activity of the tribes.

**Interesting Season Notes**

- The tribes started with partially built boma fences around their camp. This and Gabon are the only seasons that future any prebuilt structures. 
- Ep7, the first individual immunity challenge is the premiere of the ""hold your arm in the air"" challenge. Teresa wins immunity after rock, paper, scissors with Clarence.
- Ep8, Ethan wins the reward of two goats to take into town and barter. Really unique reward.
- Ep10 is the first sighting of Jeff saying the full ""Lex wins immunity!"". Even then it is a little half assed and still not a consistent thing by the end of the season.

**Controversial Topics**

- The final 4 immunity challenge is the tribe mate quiz challenge. Lex gives a correct answer that is ruled wrong, giving Kim J immunity. Huge mistake that completely changes the final 4. If Kim J doesn't win immunity she is gone that night. With so much on the line it is disappointing that production wouldn't be 100% on the answers to their questions. CBS does boost Tom and Lex's payout to the second place money of $100,000 as compensation.
- The voting tiebreaker: This season sees two deadlock votes. The first happens at Samburu's first tribal. With no previous votes possible the tiebreaker becomes a survival quiz, the only time we have ever seen this tiebreaker used. After the tribe swap the game again becomes a game of figuring out who has past votes. Lindsey's previous votes against eliminate her just before the merge. 

**Overall Season Rating**

I personally have this season ranked around the middle of the 26. The location of Africa is bold and really cool, but ultimately hinders the game a bit. This is the first season that all the contestants are their to play from day 1, and production really finds a nice balance between gameplay and survival. Ethan plays a great social game throughout, never once receiving a vote against. He put himself in a majority alliance from the beginning and successfully sticks with it. Ethan did a good job of building relationships with jury members while keeping his integrity. A solid season winner, but nothing special. I personally rank Ethan somewhere in the back half of survivor winners at 15-26.",,False,self,t5_2qhu3,1372600643.0,,,True,t3_1hbzhn,http://www.reddit.com/r/survivor/comments/1hbzhn/survivor_3_africa_breakdown/,

42 day season. The only season to extend beyond the standard 39 days.

**The Winner: Tina Wesson**

Definitely no winners edit here. Not even a confessional until ep2 and almost always talking about camp life. Tina actually cost her tribe the second immunity challenge by failing to eat the gross food. Surprisingly though, despite being an older women who cost them the challenge, she was never really on the chopping block. Her big move comes early when her Ogakor is down to 6 pre-merge. It appears her and Keith are the next to go for Ogakor, but Tina convinces Colby to vote with them on the basis of ""who is most deserving"", sending Mitchell home. After the merge, her, Keith, Colby, Elisabeth, and Rodger bond over the motto of ""most deserving players to the end"". 

**Characters**

- **Tina**: Preached for the most deserving to stay. Formed great bonds with the Kucha members that later made up the jury.
- **Colby**: The first time we see the cowboy and certainly his best appearance. Wins the final 5 immunity challenges and 3 of the final 4 rewards. Absolutely dominant.
- **Keith**: The island chef who couldn't cook rice. He really pissed people off over rice and it cost him in the end. 
- **Elisabeth**: She was so well liked she made it to final 4 and was given a job on The View to talk to America.
- **Rodger**: Just a great guy, worked hard, and had a very touching relationship with Elisabeth. Also couldn't really swim.
- **Amber**: So upbeat and optimistic it made people like her. Also an insight into Amber's Survivor strategy: get really close with whoever is the vocal leader of the tribe. This season her and Jerri are one of the tightest twosomes.
- **Jerri**: Strategized from day 1 and it made people not like her. She was rude to a lot of people and it was the cause of her early exit. I think her growth as a person/player is the greatest in Survivor over her 3 seasons.
- **Alicia**: One of the strongest females to ever compete. When Kucha lost the advantage she was quick to go. 
- **Michael Skupin**: Good leader and solid food provider from day 1. Was the leader of the dominant tribe up until his evac. Definitely deserving of a second chance.

**Season Summary**

**Start of Game**: Grab whatever supplies you want from a crate, but you have to carry it on a 4 mile hike back to camp. Both camps take the smart approach of taking everything and getting to camp slower.

**Pre-Merge**: Ogakor is splintered by Jerri and everyone is competing over Colby's vote. Meanwhile, Kucha is unified under Mike's leadership. Nothing crazy strategy wise, it was still mostly a show about people living together in a stranded location. Mike's accident really devastates everyone right before the merge.

**Merge**: In a 5v5 merge, much of the game becomes about figuring out who has prior votes against them, as this is the tiebreaker in a deadlocked situation. Kimmy previously leaked that Jeff had votes against him and that is eventually the difference. With Mike's accident and then losing the voting tiebreak, Kucha quicly loses control of the game at the merge. Voting generally follows the pattern of ""who is most deserving"" with Colby, Tina, and Keith dictating things.

**Final Immunity**: A quiz about your tribe mates. Wow. The worst final immunity challenge ever. Wrong place for this kind of challenge.

**FTC**: Up for grabs going in. Totally unbitter jury. Tina really stresses that she came in with a strategy and executed it. Colby meanwhile gives lackluster answers, including telling Jerri she doesn't deserve the money, and that he does not regret lying to her. Colby also decided not to give a closing statement, while Tina attempted a last stitch attempt at connecting on a personal level. Not saying any of this changed any votes, but at this point in the game everything is important. It is a little surprising Rodger votes Colby, while Jerri and Alicia vote Tina. Somewhere in there is the deciding vote.

**Craziest/Funniest Moments**

- 2nd challenge Rodger has to jump off of a cliff and he can't really swim.
- Jerri accuses Kel of having a secret stash of beef jerky. Her, Tina, and Amber proceed to search his bag. It is at this moment that all future contestants should have realized that your bag is not safe/private, especially when HII come into play.
- Jerri calls Keith out for not being able to cook the rice properly.
- Ep3 Mike begins his quest to hunt a pig. Everyone's confessional mocks him about having no chance. Ep4 Mike runs down a baby pig and stabs it to death.
- Ep4 has the first voting deadlock in Survivor history. The tiebreak is revealed to be previous votes against, causing Mitchel to go home.
- Kimmy &amp; Alicia get into a fight over when to kill the chickens resulting in the infamous Alicia finger wag.
- Kimmy apparently doesn't bathe because she thinks the river is dirty. Skupin has a few hilarious confessionals commenting on her hygiene.
- Kucha tribe discovers the chicken feed is secretly delicious and constantly makes it as a snack.
- Skupin falls into the fire on day 17, causing the first Survivor medical evacuation. Probably the scariest Survivor moment until Russell Swan's evac in Samoa.
- After poor food rationing the Barramundi tribe is forced to trade Jeff all of their tarps in exchange for more rice and fishing hooks.
- Rain floods the camp washing everything away, resulting in the first natural destruction of a camp in Survivor history. Tina and Keith are able to cross the river to get the rice back.

**What if/Why Moments**

- What if Tina is voted out on Day 6 for costing her tribe immunity? It is not unreasonable to think of, but it obviously changes the whole game. Colby making FTC is still likely though.
- What if Skupin doesn't fall in the fire? He for sure make the merge, maybe even with a numbers advantage. He was in a good position to make a deep run.
- What if Colby takes Keith to FTC instead of Tina? Consensus seems to be that Colby wins. This just wasn't Colby's style though. He didn't feel Keith deserved it and was legitimately happy when Tina won.

**Underlying Themes**


- **The wildfire**: A wildfire was raging across the Outback just miles from the pre-merge camps. It didn't play much of a role, but really stressed the reality of the situation.
- **Colby &amp; Jerri**: Jerri was in love with Colby, and Colby wanted nothing to do with her. These two play together 3 times and this is the season that starts their relationship. I particularly love their relationship because most players like Parvati, Amanda, and Cirie, use their past relationships to their advantage. These two instead make it a priority to eliminate each other. You could also argue that Jerri gets better in every one of her seasons, while Colby slowly deteriorates.
- **Who is the most deserving?**: Colby saved Keith early on because he felt he deserved to stay. Jerri, Nick, and Amber were all voted off in favor of keeping the more deserving Rodger and Elisabeth. Colby also took Tina to FTC instead of Keith because he felt she deserved it more.

**Interesting Season Notes**

- Castaways are given their personal items right away again. Colby brings a huge Texan flag for instant shelter.
- Ep3 Immunity challenge is the first time upon winning a challenge Jeff shouts, ""Kucha"" and raises his arms. This only happens sporadically throughout pre-merge with the two tribes though. Once individual immunity comes around he abandons it. At this point we still haven't seen a full arm raise with, ""X wins immunity!""
- Ep6 has the first blindfold challenge in Survivor history. These are always great.
- Ep7 is the first time we see the individual challenge of ""stand on this poll in the water"". This is the challenge that gets Jenna and Heidi naked in the Amazon. Keith wins this challenge.
- Ep10 has the first Survivor auction, a personal favorite of mine.

**Controversial Topics**

- The voting deadlock tiebreaker being past votes against. Such a bad way to break a deadlock, and it really plays a role in this season happening twice. I am not a huge fan of the ""purple rock"" scenario which is the current solution, but I think it is an improvement from past votes against.

- Colby took some coral from the Great Barrier Reef while on a reward. During the same reward the helicopter pilot flew over protected bird rookeries.

**Overall Season Rating**

I personally love this season for the location, the Australian Outback. It is a welcomed difference to today's game of only tropical islands. The lack of food options definitely seems to take its toll though. Production lost some of that documentary feel from Borneo while finding a nice balance between social and strategic talk. Tina played a strong game for the season. After avoiding danger early, she was in the majority for the whole game. She did an excellent job of establishing personal relationships with members of the eventual jury and gave a solid FTC performance. She isn't one of the best winners ever, but she did play a solid game and deserved it in the end. Something has to be said that she was the oldest female winner until Denise. For me she ranks on the lower end of Survivor winners though probably placing in the 15-26 range.",,False,self,t5_2qhu3,1372518725.0,,,True,t3_1haklf,http://www.reddit.com/r/survivor/comments/1haklf/survivor_2_australian_outback_breakdown/,

Final 3 -- What is CBS's logic?,41,9,49,http://www.reddit.com/r/survivor/comments/1dc7ja/final_2_v_final_3_what_is_cbss_logic/,"I've been watching Survivor since the first season, way back in 2000. One of the few ""twists"" I have never liked about the show was the seemingly permanent move from a Final 2 to a Final 3 tribal council.

The final three schtick has never really played out for CBS. We usually have one or two ""deserving"" finalists who take most of the attention and votes, and a third finalist who gets zero to no votes. 

Meanwhile, I think the third participant ruins the moment. A final two is an epic acheivement: the two have lasted through as many votes as possible, as any further tribal votes would be an obvious tie. A final two forces juxtaposition between the players, and adds layers to the vote because it rewards the strategy of bringing along an unlikeable player: instead of garnering votes, you know you'll get votes because of jury members voting against.

A third participant screws up that strategy. Furthermore, it results in fewer backstabs, less of a dramatic endgame (as people merely need to get to three, not two, without angering too many others).

I would love to hear people's ideas of why a final three is better than a final two, especially if Burnett or Probst have explained the logic. It just seems like a stupid way to diminish the drama in the final episode while gaining nothing but ""mixing up"" how the vote is traditionally done.",,False,self,t5_2qhu3,False,,,True,t3_1dc7ja,http://www.reddit.com/r/survivor/comments/1dc7ja/final_2_v_final_3_what_is_cbss_logic/,

If the Broliance is knocked off in the next 3 episodes, that means Erik has to win 3 immunity challenges to guarantee himself a final 3. Not impossible considering his biggest challenge threat will be Andrea.

Also consider Stealth will likely turn on their own before getting rid of Erik. With 6 people left, the player on the bottom (likely Sherri) will want to sway Brenda and Erik into a majority with... Dawn maybe? That's final 4, Erik wins endurance immunity challenge and gets rid of Dawn.

Erik cites Sandra strategy of staying under the radar from her 2 wins, and takes home the million.

- Men vs Women! The two tribes are divided by gender to start the game. Playing into this, it seems that this cast was a little bit younger and more beautiful than previous casts. 

**The Winner: Jenna Morasca**

The youngest person to ever play and to ever win at the time. A swimsuit model in a season of battle of the sexes and she knew how to use it. She often came across as spoiled and vain, but there is no denying that everyone seemed to love her. Jenna and Heidi form the tightest pair of the season. She was in a power position for the early to mid game, being a part of the Beautiful Alliance with Alex, Heidi, and Rob, but that was short lived. From the final 6 on Jenna is in danger and had to win the final two immunity challenges to make FTC. She was the last women standing and played a loyal game through out which helped her in the end. 

**Characters**

- **Jenna**: A lindslide win at FTC and a surprisingly strong challenge competitor. Used her sexuality like crazy.

- **Matthew**: This guy loved his machete. He really excelled at the survival aspects of the game, but was a bit in the dark strategically. Always was in control of Butch's vote, but at the same time usually being controlled by Rob. Everyone thought he was really weird and creepy.

- **Rob Cesternino**: Witty one liners, and great confessionals, this guy was hillarious and changed the game forever strategically. He was never afraid to find a better deal and improve his position in the game. He basically had three votes the entire game with Matt and Butch following him the whole way. It got him all the way to third, but it also cost him in the end. 

- **Butch**: The principal who brought the ""Believe in yourself"" banner. He was obsessed with collecting and storing firewood. He was loyal, but never did much strategically. 

- **Heidi**: Intelligent, athletic, and sexy. She was well liked by everyone, and had a tight alliance with Jenna.

- **Christy**: The first handicapped person to ever compete on Survivor. Being deaf put her at a communication disadvantage which led to her not fitting in well with the women originally, but she did much better after the tribe swap. She was in a good spot with six left, but she hesitated on giving her word and it cost her.

- **Deena**: The only non-beautiful to have anything going on strategically this season. A bit bossy and was elected leader of the original Jaburu. She got caught conspiring to take out the Beautiful Alliance and was taken out. 

**Season Summary**

**Start of Game**: Tribes are divided by sex and given boats to paddle to camp. At camp awaits 5 big water jugs already filled with fresh water, flint, lanterns, kerosine, manioc flour, and personal machetes for everyone. A very uninteresting start besides the gender divide. 

**Pre-Merge**: The women of Jaburu are a mess from the beginning. Sleeping on the ground the first night, and not completing shelter until day 7. They are divided by age, but Deena sides with the younger girls to give herself, Jenna, Heidi, and Shawna the majority. The only saving grace of Jaburu is that they actually won challenges, which is actually worth a lot since they were facing a tribe of all guys. The Tambaqui men on the other hand have a great camp life going on, but keep losing challenges to the women. 

**Tribe Swap**: The long awaited gender interactions. It starts off even with three men and three women on each. On Tambaqui, Heidi turns on the women and votes off Jeanne, while Jaburu votes off Shawna who was ready to go mentally/physically.

**Merge**: The men go into the merge up 6v4. Roger, Butch, and Dave think it is back to men vs women, but Alex, Rob, and Matt have aligned with the Jaburu women and get rid of the sexist Roger. Prior to this Survivor was all about getting to the merge with numbers and staying loyal until it is just your tribe left. The Beautiful Alliance of Alex, Jenna, Heidi, and Rob dictate the next couple of votes until Rob flips again and takes out Alex, putting Jenna and Heidi on the chopping block. Rob, with the voting help of Matt and Butch, then run things to the final four. Only Jenna winning the final two immunities prevents an all male final 3 and FTC.

**Final Immunity**: Hold a tribal headpiece above your head, while balancing on a perch. It was held at tribal council in front of the jury. Matt falls first and Rob tries to get Jenna to step down on the promise of taking her to FTC. She declines and wins. 

**FTC**: Jenna says she played morally, and stayed loyal to her alliances. She also says she she needs the money more and that should effect their decision. Matt stands by his work ethic around camp as well as his challenge performances.  Christy asks the only tough question of the night when she confronts Jenna about saying she was ""handicapped because she was beautiful"". Seems like everyone's mind was made up before hand.

**Funniest/Craziest Moments**

- At the very beginning, Shawna can't untie the women's boat from the bigger ship. 

- The first night both teams just talk shit about the other tribe.

- Rob's magic 8 ball. So many questions about hooking up with the women.

- The guys are so cocky and lose the first challenge becuase of a balancing beam. Is a balancing beam the big gender equalizer?

- Joanna freaks out over the immunity idol and doesn't want it in camp because it goes against her beliefs.

- Joanna confronts Christy and puts her hand in her face.

- Women's tribe fins a partially eaten energy bar. Jeanne puts the blame on Janet.

- Matt and Daniel speak mandarin chinese to each other.

- Matching items challenge is the first tribe interaction and the flirting is on.

- ""I didn't know Jesus had a vested interest in Survivor...Every picture I have seen Jesus is a guy, I would think he would want the guys to win."" Rob commenting on Joanna

- Shawna breaks down and wants to quit, but her alliance won't vote her out.

- Alex hits himself in the forehead with a machete.

- The disgusting challenge of ripping meat off the pig with no hands and spitting it out.

- Heidi and Jenna get naked for peanut butter, oreos, and coke.

- Matt constantly sharpens his machete. Everyone thinks he is going to kill them.

- Butch gets bit on his finger by a ""dead"" piranha.

- Heidi gets bit on the knee by a spider. Huge swelling and she can't walk for a couple days.

- Christy pays $340 at the auction for her letter from home after not buying anything else and never going on a  reward. Jenna then starts to cry that she was outbid so Jeff puts the letters back up for bid and Jenna gets her for $120. I thought this was ridiculously unfair to Christy and a bitch move on Probst's part for caving into Jenna's tears. Back at camp, Jenna and Heidi then make remarks saying Christy was rude for outbidding her.

- Jenna and Heidi don't help with building a new shelter because they are the next to go.

- Everyone gets drunk after the loved ones reward. Butch possibly soiled himself in the shelter?

- Jenna gives up her immunity necklace to Heidi at 6 left. This is the first time anyone ever gave up immunity.

- Butch's obsession with collecting firewood leads to the Jacare camp burning down.


**What if/Why Moments**

- What if the older women and Christy take out Shawna, Jenna, and Heidi on the original Jaburu. They should have realized there would always be a divide, and that it would get even worse when the guys became involved. Something like this was the only way a non-beautiful person was winning this season.

- Why does Christy waiver at 6? She just has to agree to vote out Heidi, something she had been wanting to do. Instead she doesn't commit to Rob and everyone turns on her.

- What if Jenna doesn't win immunity at final four? She goes home that night leaving an all male final 3. All the sudden Matt is on great terms with both guys. A Matt and Rob final might be the most likely outcome here. Same thing at final three.

- Why does everyone love Jenna so much? She was lazy and whiny, yet everyone put up with everything she did. The jury even seemed to have there minds made up prior to FTC. Because she's hot? Is it her story? Her age? 

**Underlying Themes**

- **Men vs Women**: Could a group of women possibly survive in a rain forest and compete with a group of men? This cast and the gender separation also led to a lot of sexual tension.

- **Jenna and Heidi**: They formed the tightest alliance of the season and one of the strongest women duo's of all time. They were both ridiculously good looking too and used it to their advantage. 

**Interesting Season Notes**

- This is the first season to give the castaways flint as a fire source.

- This is the first of three seasons to divide the castaways into two tribes of men vs women. (Vanuatu and One World)

**Controversial Topics**

- There was speculation that Christy did not understand that at FTC you vote for who you want to win, not who you want to vote off. Christy said at the reunion she voted for Jenna because she was a women and she was with her from the beginning. 

**Overall Season Rating**

The Amazon was an exciting season of Survivor. The locale was interesting and the gender divide was a good twist that added a lot of entertainment value. The cast wasn't stacked, but Rob's weekly narration more than made up for it. For the first time in a couple seasons the post merge became unpredictable and alliances changed from week to week. Even with a lopsided FTC I have the Amazon in the top half of my season rankings. Jenna was the first women to ever use the flirt/sexy card with such success. She also (unknowingly?) had a very sympathetic story that possibly influenced votes. She stayed loyal throughout and it paid off as her former alliances made up the jury. Though she wasn't in control of anything towards the end of the game she won back to back immunity challenges to get FTC and then had a huge margin of victory. I rank Jenna towards the back half of Survivor winners.",,False,self,t5_2qhu3,1372993746.0,,,True,t3_1ho4t6,http://www.reddit.com/r/survivor/comments/1ho4t6/survivor_6_amazon_breakdown/,

Here were the ideas(I'll throw in counter arugements/agreements in there):

**-Go back to Final Two**

I'm more on the side of keeping it at Final 3. Someone mentioned winning the last immunity challenge gives you too much power as you're already going to FTC. On the flip side,  someone mentioned it's easier to get an alliance of 3 to the FTC, than it is for a two person alliance. 

**-Equal editing(no brainer)**

**-Reward Challenges and Immunity Challenges. Both are separate challenge.**

While I agree that Reward/Immunity should be separate challenges, that time would cut into editing the players. Not a lot of time would be dedicated to the players themselves. 

**-Three tribes at the beginning of the game**

As of late, I would like to see more than two tribes at the beginning. It's becoming tiresome to watch one tribe dominate the other tribe(Samoa) over and over again.

**-Director's cut online for each episode**

I'm in full support of this. There is always the casual/hardcore fanbase. Casual's don't care enough for to want to view more while hardcore fans may want to see more footage and strategy. 

**-16 or 18 player seasons**

I'm more on the 18 player side. I support 18 do to medical evacs/players who quit the game. Shit happens and if it happens when there is starting total of 16 players, we would get the dreaded recap episode of Survivor. I'll support 20 players for a(n) All-stars/FvF/HvV type season.

**-New locations**

Obvious in full support of this. My favorite seasons besides HvV was Gabon and China because of their location. 

**-""Survivor: Classic""**

Don't have much to say here since I haven't seen a lot of seasons with Exile Island. What I would like to note is that it cuts into the ""Equal editing"" and challenges time. Could be included within the Director's cut.

**-All new players**

See below

**-Redditors are divided on returning players.** 

See below

**-[Rotation for the types of seasons.](http://www.reddit.com/r/survivor/comments/1ej5tn/what_exactly_do_people_want_with_a_new_season_of/ca0rp2b)** 

I see no other reason if Survivor were to continue for years to come to do it in this format. Seasons with 2-3 returning players are real boring/unfair. They know to play the game(and sometimes well). Should be included in a(n) All Stars/FvF/HvH. Seasons that had 2-3 returning players, (Redemption Island, South Pacific, Philippians) had a player in the FTC.(Unless I missed some other seasons that included this format)

The people who are brought back is another debate.

**-""only 1 challenge advantage, and it will be at the auction.""**

Agreed. Most players who get an advantage, will win the next challenge. Should not be the case for the last challenge. I'm in favor of a Reward challenge before their final challenge. Get to bring one other person along to eat some food, possibly sleep, before the last challenge. No actual advantage.

**-No Hidden Immunity Idols or make them harder to find.** 

I say keep the HII but make the harder to find. I loved seeing players fight over a clue or trying to sneak it away so no one sees. Maybe one HII where it's easy to find.

**-[Different ways to select tribes](http://www.reddit.com/r/survivor/comments/1ej5tn/what_exactly_do_people_want_with_a_new_season_of/ca0v6sx)**

I wouldn't like for it to be this way every season. Some seasons pre-selected(HvV), maybe an All-Stars as a school yard pick, egg smashing in some other seasons. Most seasons should have a different type of tribe selection. 

Agree/disagree, chime in your thoughts on these ideas.

1365537451.0,27,self.survivor,1c0er7,DAE actually like having returning players?,37,10,51,http://www.reddit.com/r/survivor/comments/1c0er7/dae_actually_like_having_returning_players/,"With 26 seasons under their belt and nearly 400 prior contestants to choose from, I think there are plenty of interesting characters available from prior seasons that bringing them back in some form or another actually *adds* to the entertainment.

Of the 8 seasons with returnees, 2 have been all stars (the original all-stars and HVV) and 2 have been Fans vs. favorites.  The original all-star season was lousy if you ask me, but it was a foregone conclusion that they'd do an all-star season at some point.  And HvV and FvF1 are widely considered 2 of the best seasons EVAH.  This season is still, of course, to be determined (hell, the game just started last week).

The season with a smattering of returnees has been somewhat less successful.  Bobby Jon and Stephanie returning was really more of a non-event than anything - it didn't really impact the season as far as entertainment value goes.  Redemption Island was annoying for a lot of reasons, Rob playing for the 4th time was only one of the annoying aspects - and not the most annoying.  Ozzy &amp; Coach in South Pacific wasn't a great season, but certainly wasn't horrible.  I don't think the returned med evac'ds had a huge impact last season; I'd much rather have returning players than B-list celebrities like Lisa.

So for me, while I'd certainly be fine with some seasons with no returning players, I think the seasons with 2-3 returnees don't necessarily play out a lot differently than seasons with all new players.  And season with all returnees - or a full tribe of returnees - I find to be some of the most entertaining seasons we've had.

&gt; A total of 396 participants have competed, and 53 of them have competed in multiple seasons: 39 of them competed in two seasons, 13 competed three times, and one competed four times. So far, there have been 8 seasons which featured returning players: In 2004, an All-Stars edition aired, with the cast being eighteen past competitors; in 2005 as part of a surprise twist, two past contestants from Survivor: Palau competed again in Survivor: Guatemala; in 2008, Survivor: Micronesia featured a tribe of ten returning contestants against a tribe of ten new contestants; in 2010, Survivor: Heroes vs. Villains featured 20 returning contestants, including nine that were competing for the third time; and in 2011, two past castaways returned for Survivor: Redemption Island and two other past castaways returned for Survivor: South Pacific.[1][2] In 2012, three past castaways who were medically evacuated from their previous seasons returned for Survivor: Philippines. In 2013, ten returning castaways competed for a second time against ten new castaways in Survivor: Caramoan.  **[Source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Survivor_%28U.S._TV_series%29_contestants)**",,False,self,t5_2qhu3,False,,Brenda,True,t3_1c0er7,http://www.reddit.com/r/survivor/comments/1c0er7/dae_actually_like_having_returning_players/,

Players are never pleased to be voted out; that is why they are put on a jury. They exist to put the final 3 (or 2) on trial for sending them home. Thus, jury management is a key to the game; be in control of who goes home, but also in control of how they go home. After reading the Funny115 post concerning Russell’s fall in Samoa and giving the season a re-watch, I think there is more to be said about the specifics of the end game rather than simply exposing the tragic flaw of Russell. We all know he’s an abrasive troll that contrasts Natalie White’s personality which is as bright and alluring as her golden bikini. Funny115 hammers this point home in fantastic fashion, but I intend to go through the jury members one by one in order to discover why they may have voted for Natalie or against Russell. Jury members are notorious for voting based on their own game rather than the games of those in the final. For a recent example (SEASON 25 FTC SPOILER), RC’s vote goes to Lisa in order to validate her own game. She claims to have registered Lisa as the biggest threat; therefore, Lisa’s dominance took the game away from her. Jury members constantly turn to their own games as a point of reference to decide the winner. Players that recognize this thrive in tribal council; Skupin’s answer for Carter reflects this beautifully. Essentially, “Carter, we had to vote you out because you were too great a guy and too strong in challenges.” Players like Carter and Jean-Robert (China) eat up flattery about their game, no matter how thick it’s laid on. Using this process of Jury analysis, let’s go through the Juror’s of Samoa. 

Erik- In the First 27 days recap, we learn a lot about Erik’s game. Arriving on the island, he saw Russell Swan’s voted leadership as a perfect opportunity to slide under the radar while still calling the shots. Asserting himself as Russell’s right hand man, Erik was able to make decisions while staying in a position not threatened by anyone’s desire to usurp command. I hope the similarities to Natalie’s game are clear in this assessment. They both dive under an egotistical leader in order to get farther. Thus, Erik’s speech follows an analysis of the finalists’ game play. He asserts that Russell Hantz proudly lied, cheated, and stole his way to the end while Natalie flew under the radar. “But why is Natalie’s game any less valuable than Russell’s?” Erik asks us. In Erik’s mind, Natalie’s game (and his own) is the Holy Bible of Survivor strategy. Thus, Natalie wins his vote for successfully pulling it off. Sorry Russell, not much you could do about this one.

Kelly- She outright asserts that she is tougher than Natalie. Kelly claims to have never seen Natalie prove herself in the challenges as she had. As a side note, I find this very odd as Natalie was forced to compete in every challenge due to the Foa Foa losing streak (maybe Kelly felt she played more physical roles in the challenges). However, Natalie responds attesting to examples of her struggles roughing it in the bush. In other words, she re-draws the comparison to Kelly. Natalie recalls the rough conditions they both survived and thrived in. Kelly then asks Russell what he values most outside the game; she claims it’s difficult to look past the crude values he demonstrated on the island. Unfortunately, Russell does not turn to examples as Natalie does. By contrast, he simply states that he values “honour, integrity, and loyalty” to his family is most important to him. Actions speak louder than words, Russell; state you want to win this for your family and you may have stood a chance. Demonstrate how these qualities are reflected in your actions, don’t just claim they are. Natalie gains this vote by using examples to compare herself and Kelly; she validates what Kelly would hope to be the eventual outcome of her toughness and resilience in the game despite her demeanour. 

Laura- Kelly and Monica flocked toward Laura. She was the mother hen of their tribe. After the merge, it becomes evident that her ego is the size of Texas. She asserts control over the two girls she would take to the end and treats everyone else as a number. Her dismissive treatment of others reflects, I believe, many similarities to Russell. So, why doesn’t she vote for Russell? Let’s turn to her jury question to highlight the answer. After all, jury members typically have their minds set before tribal council, so their questions reveal more about themselves than they do about the finalists. Laura asks Russell what he learned about her that enabled him to beat her. Russell’s answer doesn’t matter because Laura is trying to trap Russell; like Kelly, Laura doesn’t think she was beat by anybody. John’s flip in the re-vote sends her home; in her mind, it was the weakness of another player that sent her home. Thus, Natalie holds more similarities to Laura’s game. Natalie was an intelligent woman that Laura would insist out smarted Russell. Moreover, after speaking to Erik at Ponderosa, I can only assume that she would have thought Natalie had actually beaten her. Natalie convinced her to turn on Erik which many of the Galu, after speaking to Erik and determining his loyalties, would take as the turning point of the game.

John- Most people praise John for his ability to objectively view the game avoiding “bitterness.” However, he’s just like every other Jury member; he’s swayed by his own opinion of his game rather than his opinion of the games of the finalists. It is very evident that John wanted to be in control of his situation. When he saw an opportunity to avoid drawing rocks, he jumped at it. He took control of his fate and tried to make a deal with Russell. Similarly, Russell asserts his “control” in the game; he made the plans and executed them. Russell always wanted to avoid putting the fate of his game in someone else’s hands. John’s not going to vote for Natalie or Mick; they put their games in the hands of Russell and rode him to the end. Thus, Russell validates John’s view of the game and validates his flip against Galu to avoid the rocks. We can’t say John simply isn’t bitter and that’s why he voted for Russell; Russell’s FTC speech is tapered to the interest John held in the game. Russell goes through the thought process of his strategy and proves to execute what John only attempted. 

Dave- Watching throughout the season, it is clear that Dave wanted to get by based on his merits and what he provided for the tribe. Note his boasts that he won the chickens single-handedly with his throw in the challenge. Moreover, he constantly asserts that he provided fire for his tribe. Socially, he allowed others to make his decisions. Dave was in it for the group; if his group made it to the end, he honestly believed he was the “best” in the group and would win on that alone. Unfortunately, his jury question is less than revealing. As a reminder, he asks what the finalists think their chances are. Thus, based on the evidence available, I’m leaning to believe Dave continued to follow the group voting for Natalie. I could also suggest that perhaps Dave thought his game was reflected in Natalie; she constantly refers to the Foa Foa alliance as a group or as “we.” She explains the decisions were made as a group and suggests that she was able to thrive in the wilderness (similar to Dave). By contrast, Russell asserts his position as an individual, alienating the values Dave held in the game. 

Monica- Returning to Funny115, I suppose we can pinpoint Russell’s failure to the way she was booted. Monica insists that if Russell votes her out, he’s not going to have a single friend on the jury. My assessment of Monica’s game is pretty weak, so I’m inclined to fall back on this moment as an exception to my Jury analysis. It’s pretty clear that when she said that to Russell, she meant it; she would never vote for Russell after he voted her out. Although it’s also possible that Monica viewed her game as one that would not stir the pot until her back was against the wall. Russell constantly stirs stuff up regardless; he makes absurd promises to everyone portraying an erratic game. Natalie didn’t make a move until her back was absolutely against the wall and she was forced to stir the pot against Erik at the merge. She then just let Galu fall apart on its own thanks to the power struggles exposed by the boot. Maybe Monica saw this and that’s why she voted for Natalie instead of Mick, but it was always clear she would not vote for Russell. 

 Shambo- Throughout the post merge, Shambo felt that she and Russell were running the show together. It was a combined effort between the two to dismantle Galu. In her mind, they were playing a fantastic game, and Russell managed to beat her in the end. Thus, Shambo describes Natalie using the dirtiest “c-word” she knows: “coattail rider.” Natalie suggests the decisions were mutually arrived at among the Foa Foa, but Shambo believes it was all her and Russell. Russell gets her vote because they share the strategy of in-your-face backstabbing. 

Jaison- To vote for Russell would be to highlight a flaw in his game. With Brett winning so many immunities, Jaison would have been forced to the end with Russell. He suggested to Monica earlier in the game that he intended to vote out Russell once he could no longer use his HII, but this gets thrown out the window when Brett wins immunity at final 5. At this point, Jaison knows he has to go with Russell to the final 3 unless he tries to blindside him at final 5. Wheels turning, Jaison is probably trying to think of what he is going to say to the jury with Russell sitting next to him. But he gets voted out and, in his final confessional, explains that he is only upset because Russell never told him he was going home. Had Russell explained anything to Jaison, whether he say Jaison was a threat or too weak to beat Brett, Jaison would be in the same boat as Shambo. In order to justify his game, which would take him to the end with Russell, he has to vote for Mick or Natalie. The other part of Jaison’s game was to overcome his stereotypes and remain strong; he goes through this thought constantly. It is particularly evident in the First 27 Days episode when we re-view his clash with Ben in terms of living up to the strong image set by his father. Jaison wanted to overcome stereotypes surrounding him by winning the game. Jaison also states earlier in the season that he was very “proud” of Natalie for overcoming the stereotypes surrounding her as a blonde. After she kills a rat, he confesses that it was amazing to see her grow to be independent of her surface image. Thus, Natalie gets the advantage over Mick for Jaison’s vote. 

Brett- Coming back to camp with Mick and Natalie after losing a reward challenge, he denounces any aggressive strategy and just passively enjoys a picnic with them on the beach. Brett was clearly there, at least in his final days, to enjoy the adventure and survive the wilderness. He doesn’t care for assertive strategy, but rather he would prefer to glide by on his own merits. Thus, Russell is out of the equation for Brett. Despite flattering Brett as an excellent young man perfect for his daughters, there is no way Russell will get his vote. Russell was there for the game; Brett was there for the adventure. Natalie and Mick have already bonded with Brett on their picnic, so Russell’s attempts (though admirable considering it is Russell) are too little too late. Thus, Brett awkwardly asks Mick in FTC what they would do on a “bro-date.” Mick doesn’t take this question seriously and instead dances around it before providing a very flat answer that they would “watch sports and enjoy some beers.” He essentially hands Natalie Brett’s vote. 

This came out extremely long and drawn out, but I hope it has helped some people understand why Russell lost Samoa. Russell’s flaw was thinking everyone played the game in the same way as him. This is never true; everyone takes their own approach, and finalists are forced to flatter various approaches while beating them out. It’s a tragedy as great as Hamlet watching Russell ignore this factor killing himself and everyone around him trying to win the game. Like Hamlet, he destroys his kingdom handing over to the last (wo)man standing.

1367617357.0,25,self.survivor,1dn7nj,Plugging my case to the producers (and fans): why a 3 tribe game will always trump a 2 tribe game,32,7,43,http://www.reddit.com/r/survivor/comments/1dn7nj/plugging_my_case_to_the_producers_and_fans_why_a/,"I've recently watched the all-stars season and also Survivor Philippines, both with a **3 tribe structure instead of the usual 2**. Now my reasoning (might be a bit long, but bear with me) for why these seasons allow for better strategic gaming is this.

Just as in politics, tribes inevitably form voting blocs as tribes, some stronger than others. The reason is that blocs need maximum trust to be secure and since trust is fostered by more time spent with people, blocs will form in tribes, who have a common goal, avoiding tribal council, rather than post-merge in a individual game. This much I guess we can all agree on. Yeah, sure, people who feel the least included in blocs will always have reason to switch, but they are always just trading one bottom for another.

When **two tribes** merge, the politics are pretty **straight-forward**. Bigger tribe votes off Smaller tribe one-by-one (unless both tribes have equal members, there's a stand-off or walkover for one vote and voting proceeds as normal), perhaps strategically using one or two of the Smaller tribe to pull a move within Bigger tribe, but not before there is some security that Smaller tribe does not get to call the shots. The politics immediately after the merge resemble the American bipartisan political system. Whoever has majority in the house calls the shots. Might work for a country, but if you were to make a TV show out of it... boring!

So what is the difference with a **3 tribe system**? Now post-merge, you have Big Tribe, Medium Tribe and Small Tribe, or perhaps Big Tribe, Big Tribe (iow, equal members), Small Tribe or something of this nature. Now, more like the situation arising a few years ago in the UK, there is a ""hung parliament"", and just as in politics it makes for great viewing pleasure. A **coalition** is likely to form, something which is impossible within 2 tribe games. Medium Tribe can convince Small Tribe to join them to eliminate their biggest threat, Big Tribe, but the same can be said for Big Tribe convincing Small Tribe. Some deal has to be struck and whomever can give Small Tribe the best deal gets their votes. Medium Tribe will make deals more aggressively, promising final threes and fours and it essentially becomes a game of one-upping. Mixed in all the trust issues of, ""Can these deals with strangers be taken seriously?"" and you have yourself a hectic post-merge political game. Amirite?

**In both All-stars and Philippines, the producers basically ruined this post-merge** dynamic by trying to put in a twist in the pre-merge, dividing one tribe's members up into the other tribes. Sure, these divided players can perhaps pull other divided players later like Malcolm did with Denise in Philippines, but it lacks that merge mega-scramble.

So this is the way I would do it. Get three tribes of 8 (debatable, but it gives more people the chance to play, which is always fun to watch) and change immunity challenges in the 3 tribe game so that only 1 tribe does not go to tribal council. Scrap reward challenges altogether (fans want to see suffering for everyone out there, not people eating steaks and sliding down waterfalls) so that there is more time for editing tribal councils. Merge can happen by 7th episode, meaning the smallest possible tribe would have two members left, which could still have lots of swaying power in the game. 

Any more tribes than 3 and the editing becomes too much of a problem. 4 instances of people trying to makes 4 different fires, 4 different shelters, getting 4 different grades of dehydration and alliance-forming might be pushing the limit of the amount of game you can put into a show.

So who's with me? Critiques?

1365787804.0,28,self.survivor,1c7usq,(SPOILERS) Combining Wednesday Nights episode with the Evicted Castaways Interviews,32,4,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/survivor/comments/1c7usq/spoilers_combining_wednesday_nights_episode_with/,"In my office I stumbled upon other survivor fans and we started doing email chains after each episode. After each episode I search out the exit interviews and try to piece together the parts we saw with the parst unaired. I worked hard on my analysis so I thought I would share it with the Survivor fans of Reddit. Let me know what you guys think.

Poor Michael. He really had no clue that he was going home that night. I’ve been reading his interviews and watching the secret scenes on cbs.com to gain more insight into what actually happened between Brenda’s win and tribal council. To make a long story short, Michael’s alliance-mate’s poor game play did him in and ruined their collective chances of progressing into the end game. 

So Michael is the only Fan left from New Bikal (purple tribe) and this really should be a huge advantage for him relative to the 3 fans on New Gota...so why didn’t it pan out? According to Michael’s interviews, after Corinne left, he still maintained a good relationship with Dawn, Cochran and Phillip, with fairly open communication about possibly using Michael further in the game. We never saw anything like that during the show. Before Andrea flipped out and started changing the vote 10 min before tribal, Dawn (he specifically calls her out) approached Michael, told him he was safe, and directed him to lay back until he is needed later in the game. 

We thought he had a great relationship with Sherri before the flip, and according to Michael he expected to continue working with her post-merge, but because the Favorites tricked the Fans into voting for Sherri during Corinne’s last tribal council, Sherri disowned Michael. On an emotional level, I understand why Sherri did this, but on a game level...you should never vote ANYONE off who will give you information and secrets. Even if they’re not technically in your alliance, they are an asset to your game. Andrea gets it, and I suspect that’s why Eddie wasn’t targeted.

I also found out that an important swing vote had it out for Michael. Take a guess who. It’s totally unexpected. No, it’s not Phillip...BRENDA. Of course Brenda has only had 1 confessional throughout the entire show so how would we know this, but because Brenda was either #8 or #7 in the Favorites alliance, Corinne was targeting Brenda before the tribal swap. Even though Corinne left, Brenda still had a vendetta specifically against Michael and was not willing to work with anyone associated with Corinne (Malcolm, Reynold, Eddie and Michael). Fair enough.

So then Dawn plays Malcolm, sets him up for a blindside, sets Michael up to still trust her and remain a possible ally...when Hurricane Andrea storms through and swaps Michael for Malcolm. As much as I hate Dawn, this one wasn’t her fault. And I feel bad for her because she will be outed as a snake because her target (Malcolm) is still in the game. Andrea screwed Dawn hard with this move. And that is why, I suspect, Dawn is crying in next week’s previews. When Dawn played Francesca, Julia and Corinne, they left that night and Dawn was able to hide her dirty deeds, but because Andrea kept Malcolm in the game, Dawn’s stock will take a hard hit.

This episode really opened up my eyes to the reality of Survivor. As good of a game Michael was playing, and as much as he trusted his allies, your allies can totally blow up your game by accident and that’s what happened to him. He was inadvertently sold out by Corinne, Eddie and Dawn. Neither of them knew what they were doing but it’s the hard truth. It’s just hard, and a little unsatisfying, to watch someone leave the game without a major flaw or mistake or faux pas (foo-paa a la Phillip) to explain it, especially this late in the game.

With that said, Michael reveals a moment that could have turned the whole thing around. After Andrea infers to Eddie that he won’t be receiving votes, Reynold and Eddie kind of put everything together and were in fact worried about Michael’s safety. Reynold OFFERED Michael his idol right before tribal council, but because Dawn reassured him he was safe (and she thought he was at the time) he declines the offer and presses Reynold to play it for himself or Malcolm. I can’t believe how giving and antagonistic Reynold is at the same time. He tries to bully Dawn and Cochran into his alliance, but is willing to share his idol with anyone aligned to him. And Michael actually states, after Corinne left, Reynold was his best friend out there. I was flabbergasted. It’s just cool to see two young bucks, alpha males like Eddie and Reynold, genuinely appreciate Michael, the NYC event planner who is twice as old as them! In Michaels pre-show interview he labels himself a “closet jock” and I’m glad we got to see that side of him on the show. 

I also remember, before the tribal swap, Michael had a confessional expressing his fear of getting the boot because of Reynold’s idol which is exactly what happened to him. I love foreshadowing in Survivor :)

EDIT

I was off about the Brenda stuff a little bit. Brenda targeted Corinne and Michael told Corinne. And then word got back to Brenda that Michael disclosed this info and that is why she had it in for Michael.",,False,self,t5_2qhu3,1365796995.0,,,True,t3_1c7usq,http://www.reddit.com/r/survivor/comments/1c7usq/spoilers_combining_wednesday_nights_episode_with/,

I was thinking, there are a few seasons that had several great contestants but only 1 or 2 of them have made returns. So how about a season vs season season. The cast would be all returns but each tribe consists of players from the same season. This would work particularly well with the three or four tribe format. With this type of return season, we get to see more of our favorite players from the same seasons, some players who didn't have much luck would get another shot, and there would be interesting tribe dynamics as all of the tribes have played with each other before.

I streamed the entire finale + reunion show last night (I think it went well) for those that needed a live stream.

I hope everyone that was watching the stream enjoyed their time, and I hope chat wasn't too evil with the spoilers.

Anyways, I really like getting the community together seeing people enjoy the show. Since I believe last night was a successful night of streaming for me, I would be very glad to bring next season's live stream back for Season 27 (Blood vs Water, All episodes live streamed?).

Just note that I do run a USA-West stream so it is 3 hours behind. And I know there are a lot of crappy quality streams. And that is my main focus bring a decent quality stream with a excellent frame-rate to comfort the eyes.

I plan on posting a weekly thread for the stream once I make sure I can stream every week.

Dawn suddenly has a huge amount of negativity directed at her going into the finale and has taken down her Twitter account.  Other Twitter messes have gone on going back to Francesca's boot at the very beginning.  How ugly is this going to be?  At this point, I'm starting to worry that Dawn is going to get very emotional and get booed (maybe in the reverse order) and it's going to be very hard to watch.

Fans:

Reynold: Obviously is the one who is being set-up as a returnee. Getting a ton of screentime, confessionals, and is speaking for his alliance mate Eddie who he is on equal footing with. Will be back.

.....other than that? Nothing is assured. The fans in this season were duds as a whole as they were in Micronesia. Shiery and Eddie have been very under-edited despite making it this far in the game. The only other remote possibility would be Shamar.


Favorites:

Phillip: Lock

Malcom: Lock...also has a very high chance of winning Fan Favorite despite leaving relatively early

Andrea: Most surprising edit in Caramoan. She took a shit ton of flack during Redemption Island for being one of Rob's drones and not making a move when she had the opportunity to do so but she's getting a big edit here. I think she will be back for the 3rd time. HOT, intelligent, good challenge competitor, decent sound byte, lack of other compelling females overall in Survivor, and Probst loves her

- All-Stars. For the first time ever contestants from previous seasons return to play the game.

- 3 Tribes. For the first time ever there are more than two tribes to start the game.

- Others include 18 contestants instead of the normal 16, two pre-merge tribe changes, and merge at 9 instead of 10.

**The Winner: Amber Brkich (Mariano)**

Amber ""took it day by day"" and ""never lost her focus"". Her and Boston Rob teamed up on day 1 to form the most dominant pair Survivor had seen to date. Not since the clueless cast of Borneo had the power of the game been so secure for so long. Rob's leadership and Godfather ways gain control early and Amber is all too happy to smile and flirt her way further in the game with him. What begins as flirting soon turns into full island love, and the two become an inseparable pair, unwilling to vote against the other. On day 12, the romantic pair of Rob and Amber team up with the other strong pair, Rupert and Jenna, and along with Big Tom pretty much coast to final 5. Amber does get separated from her alliance during the second tribe swap leading to an infamous decision by Lex to keep Amber around to please Rob. Romber lie and backstab their way to their fantasy FTC of facing each other and Amber squeaks out a 4-3 victory by seemingly lying slightly less...

**Characters** It's All-Stars so everyone is an amazing character, but I am only going to stick to players that made the merge.

- **Amber**: She let her partner in crime take the majority of the blame, and it worked out for her. In a season with this many egos, the nice girl, under the radar game was the right way to go. 

- **Boston Rob Mariano**: Played one of the single most dominant games Survivor had/has seen, but in the end he came up one vote short. He broke too many promises and the jury couldn't forgive him. His natural leadership and ability to mind-warp tribes into not even thinking about the strategic game is astounding and unparalleled. Yes, his RI win is ""flawed"" in many ways, but he showed here that he could do it with the best of them.

- **Jenna L**: Her and Rupert formed a tight pair from the original Saboga and saw it through to final four. She never stopped talking, and was unliked by multiple people. She definitely improved big time since Borneo, but I still think her strategic game was lackluster. In the end she turns on her closest ally and goes out next.

- **Rupert**: Rupert becomes the first contestant to play back-to-back seasons, and comes in with basically the same strategy. He takes on the role of provider, and refuses to ever make a major strategic decision. Rupert once again plays the perfect game to make jury, no more no less. I think this season was his if he was just willing to backstab Rob and Amber for it. 

- **Big Tom**: Romber's +1 from the beginning. His laid back, low maintenance game was the perfect fit for the aggressive Rob. Similar to Africa, he waits too long to make a move, gets caught scheming, and goes home.

- **Shii-Ann**: The she devil is back, and once again in the minority. With Rob's alliance staying so tight, Shi-Ann really just had no one to work with. That didn't stop her from trying though! She scrambled to the bitter end and even won a clutch immunity to get three more days.

- **Alicia**: As physically fit and full of attitude as ever. She believed she had final four with Rob, Amber, Tom from the beginning, but was really on the bottom of the alliance. Voted least deserving to be an all-star by her tribemates during a challenge.

- **Kathy**: She improved her social game drastically since Marquesas which kept her out of danger early. After Sandra, Kathy might be the best person to ever play the game with the swing vote strategy. It is remarkable how she consistently sets herself up to be in a position to tip a vote in a direction she chooses, without being the initiator of the plan. It is a very hard thing to do as it requires you to be practically unaligned, while not being isolated as the odd one out. 

- **Lex**: Played a strong pre-merge game until one bad decision cost him. Lex decided to vote off his ally Jerri in order to keep Amber around, and fulfill a favor to Rob. Probably one of the worst decisions in Survivor at this point, and it immediately cost him. 

**Season Summary**

**Start of Game**: The All-Stars are divided into three tribes of six. There only starting supplies are 1 water pot, 1 machete, and canteens. The least starting supplies ever at that time.

**Pre-Merge**: No fire for anyone for the first four days which was pretty brutal. Boston Rob unifies Chapera from the beginning and has majority with Amber, Tom, and Alicia. Saboga is instantly divided as Jerri and JLewis take control and make it priority to get out the former winners on their tribe, Tina and Ethan. The divide leads to poor challenge performance and having to vote out the first two people of the game. At Mogo Mogo everyone seems to get along, and them winning challenges led to not having to vote anyone out. 

**Post Saboga**: After Saboga loses the reward challenge on day 13, their tribe is dissolved and their members join the other tribes through a draft. Chapera's new additions of Rupert and Jenna are instantly courted by Rob and Amber and a final four deal is put in place. At Mogo Mogo, power is ever changing with Hatch and Colby being blindsided. Ultimately, Lex was in control with the support of Kathy and Shii-Ann. Chapera dominates and is so happy that no one even questions where they stand in Amber and Rob's plans.

**Tribe Swap**: A tribe swap just before the merge had the tribes stay the same, but switch camps, with the exception of Amber who was isolated from her alliance. Switching camps was actually really important. Chapera had built one of the nicest shelters and camps Survivor had seen, while Mogo Mogo struggled to have enough food. After the new Chapera loses the immunity challenge Rob says to Lex, ""You take care of her, I'll take care of you"". Lex and Kathy ultimately decide to spare Amber and vote off their ally Jerri.

**Merge**: Wth Amber and Rob reunited they immediately break their word with Lex and Kathy in order to reform Chapera. Lex and Kathy are furious with the decision, and are still not over it by FTC. Amber and Rob make final four deals with just about everyone, while only really staying true to Rupert and Jenna in the end. Amber and Rob proceed to cruise to FTC without ever really having a hiccup along the way. 

**Final Immunity**: Same as Africa and Marquesas. Stand with one leg on each stump while keeping a hand on the idol. Jenna drops out first, ending any chance of her making FTC. Rob and Amber compete it out and Rob wins.

**FTC**: One of the most bitter juries of any season. Rob admits his mistakes, but asks to be judged as a player, saying he didn't manipulate on purpose and isn't a malicious person. Amber doesn't have much to stand on, saying her surviving being isolated from her alliance was her big move, and that she stayed focused and took the game day by day. In the end Rob has to continually face the repercussions of his betrayals and can't ever really get past that, allowing Amber to look like the cleaner one of the two and the one whose lies were not as bad. Shii-Ann delivers the only impartial vote of the night and swings things for Amber, who she had predicted to win the night she was voted off.

**Funniest/Craziest Moments**

- Sue and Rudy drink the contaminated water without boiling it.

- Hatch gets naked for everything again.

- Hatch catches the first shark in Survivor history. He bit a shark that bit him and smashed its head on a rock. 

- The 'build a shelter' challenge basically sums up the pre-merge. At Chapera, Boston Rob dominates and they easily win. Meanwhile Saboga comes up with the worst idea ever and attempts to build a log cabin shelter that is half below ground. Rupert's idea and it was absolutely disastrous. Mogo Mogo is in the middle, doing well enough to not lose.

- Jenna Morasca quits on day 9 to return home to her dying mother.

- At the blindfold immunity challenge Boston Rob is completely stumped by the cube puzzle. Truly one of the best ever at puzzles, he could not figure this one out.

- Big Tom gets laid out during the blindfold challenge. This is what makes these challenges great.

- For the 'build a raft' challenge, Mogo Mogo just lazily bundles their bamboo together and wins. 

- Hatch nakedly rubs himself on Sue during a challenge. It affects Sue over the next couple of days leading to her quit on day 17. She goes off on Probst saying she was, ""violated, humiliated, dehumanized and totally spent.""

- Rich gets ""bamboozled"" by Colby, Ethan, and Lex

- Rupert is so protective of the fishing spear, and even mocks everyone else's attempts to fish. Rob goes out and gets eleven fish himself, and Rupert is obviously annoyed.

- Colby tells Shii-Ann he doesn't respect her game.

- Jerri is the worst offender of talking about food, and it gets on people's nerves. 

- Big Tom does the Sue's gone dance.

- While golfing off the back of a yacht during reward, Rob accidentally throws the club in the ocean.

- Lex flips on Cloby/Ethan and knocks out Colby. Jerri gets her Outback revenge.

- Jerri says at tribal that she is an upbeat, always in a good mood, hard working individual. Ethan and Colby start laughing.

- Lex tells Ethan he is going home, but ""its just business"". Ethan tells him it's not, but Lex makes the hard decision saying, ""...I am going to do whatever it takes to get me further in the game. If that means exploiting situations where I have a friend that might trust me, I'll do it. It's business this time.""

- After receiving a jar of paint with no instructions, Chapera paints themselves as a tribe. Mogo Mogo just brings the jar of paint with them.

- Lex votes off Jerri over Amber because Rob said to him, ""You take care of her, I'll take care of you"". 

- Rob trades his video from home so everyone can get their letters from home. Smart move strategically, which is why this is considered to make you a threat nowadays.

- With 8 left, Kathy warns everyone of Rob and Amber's dominance and that they will be too late. At 6 left, Shii-Ann warns everyone that Amber is going to smile her way to the money. Rupert also says he knows he will get fourth unless he does something. Jenna says the same thing about getting third. Yet no one ever tries anything...

- Rupert so obviously lays out the alliances during the pecking order reward challenge as he assigns who gets what meal.

- Shii-Ann gets obnoxious with being assigned rice.

- Shii-Ann wins immunity and overtly celebrates which annoys Alicia.

- Alicia's exit interview on Rob, ""You had a handshake with me!"" goes on to declare that Rob won't get her vote.

- Rupert only cleans and cooks one fish for himself. Jenna bitches about it.

- Rob and his brother party with Tom and his son.

- Rupert takes Big Tom's son out fishing and he loses the spear tip.

- Rob, Amber, Rupert, and Jenna all run out of matches at the fire making immunity challenge.

- Can anyone understand what Big Tom is saying?

- Rupert and Jenna conspiring against Rob in the woods and Rob walks up on them.

- Rob instigates a fight between Tom and Rupert so they won't think to team up against him.

- At FTC Alicia tells Rob and Amber, ""you have not outclassed us"".

- At FTC Shii-Ann tells the jury ""people in glass houses shouldn't throw stones""

- At FTC Tom goes to shake Rob's hand then pulls his hand away and says, ""don't be stupid, stupid"".

- Jerri booed off stage at the reunion.

**What if/Why Moments**

- Why doesn't anyone try to use Ethan? Is it solely because he was a winner? I understand the threat on the original Saboga, but after he is absorbed by Mogo Mogo he is always on the outside. With 6 left at Mogo Mogo I really thought Lex, Kathy, and Shi-Ann should have added Ethan as their fourth. Loyalty and trust are so important in Survivor, why would you not use your real world friend?

- Why does no one break up Rob and Amber? Rob goes into a daze when they are separated, and Amber had no other strong allies. Alicia, Tom, Jenna, and Rupert all needed to step up at some point. At least Kathy and Shi-Ann tried. At 6 left it should be Shii-Ann, Tom, Rupert, Jenna vs Romber. At 5 it should be Tom, Rupert, Jenna vs Romber. There were so many opportunities, but no one was willing to take it. I blame Rupert.

- What if Jenna wins final immunity? Who does she take? Does she have an easy win now that everyone has an alternate choice to Romber?

**Underlying Themes**

- **Romber**: The alliance was formed on day 1 and the romance set in shortly after. The couple dominated the game like few have ever done. The first island romance led to a live proposal at the reunion. 

- **2nd play through**: It's interesting to see how people changed from their first season to All-Stars. Some people like Tina, Rob C, and Ethan just never had anyone to play with and couldn't find their niche like the first time. Others like Colby and Jenna L, came back with a revamped strategic game, while Kathy fixed her weakness that was the social game.

**Controversial Topics**

- Unclear Tiebreaker Rules. The contestants are still under the impression that a deadlocked final four would result in the purple rock tiebreaker. This directly influences Jenna Lewis's decision to flip on Rupert and side with Romber. I feel like the rules of the game should have been made clear to the contestants, especially when the rules are only unclear because of a production mistake. This denies us the chance of an all time great Survivor moment, a fire making contest between Rob and Rupert.

- Rupert wins $1,000,000 by America's vote. The earliest form of the Sprint Player of the Game, and a bit extreme. To award the same prize based on America's vote as you get for actually winning the game was a bit odd. 

**Overall Season Rating**

All-Stars is the first season to ever use returning players and it shows how cutthroat the game of Survivor can get. Previous friendships outside of the game play a role for the first time ever, leading to personal betrayals and ultimately a bitter jury. The merge and endgame are fairly predictable, but the cast of characters and total domination by Romber put this season somewhere around my top 10. Amber played a game that was well suited for this season. When a strong male wants to dominate and take lead, the smartest thing a pretty girl can do is follow in line. Amber did this and was able to use Rob as a shield for moves that she also played a role in. While winning an All-Star season is notable, her lack of strategic moves is obvious which is why I place Amber towards the bottom of my Survivor winners rankings.",,False,self,t5_2qhu3,1373742757.0,,,True,t3_1i72vz,http://www.reddit.com/r/survivor/comments/1i72vz/survivor_8_allstars_breakdown/,

**Assumptions:**

* It is a pure 7-7 tribe swap and the contestants are distributed randomly
* Sherri, Michael, Matt and Julie are defined as ""Fans - Core"" and will stay loyal to one another after the swap.
* Eddie and Reynold are defined as ""Fans - Defectors"" and are willing to jump ship.
* Philip, Malcolm, Corrine, Dawn, Cochran, Andrea are defined as ""Favourites - Core"" and will stay loyal to one another after the swap.
* Erik and Brenda and Defined as ""Favourites - Defectors"" and are willing to jump ship.

**Method:**

* 1000 simulations in Excel (because I am not great with combinatorics) 

**Findings:**

* Based on *old* tribal lines there is 17.8% chances that the original Favourites are in the majority of both tribes and an 82.2% chance that they are in the majority of one tribe. By default this statistic also implies that there is an 82.2% chance that the Fans are in the majority of one tribe and a 0% chance that they are in the majority for both tribes.
* On both simulated tribes I found the absolute value difference between the Core Fans and Core Favourites placed on that tribe. I then totalled the number of defectors (from both Fans and Favourites) to determine if there were enough defectors to change who had the majority. In other words I tried to see if power was ""up for grabs"".  45% of the time the power was up for grabs on both tribes, 42% of the time the power was up for grabs on one tribe, and 13% of the time the tribal swap moved so few people that power remained with the core group regardless of new members.
* I ran a simulation looking at what if all defectors defected no matter what and since there are two defectors from each original tribe they usually canceled out and the majority statistics followed a similar breakdown to the first bullet in this section. 
* The odd of all four defectors (Erik, Brenda, Reynold and Eddie being placed on the same tribe and being a defector majority is 4%.

**Conclusion:**

I think we are in for a very interesting tribal swap because there is only a 13% chance that we see a swap where the people in the minority don't really have a chance and get picked off (a la Amber if Rob/Lex didn't intervene). I am well aware that I am making some generous/rudimentary assumptions and that anything can happen in Survivor. We are starting to see cracks in Stealth R Us between Philip and Corrine and Reynold appears to be more willing to work with the Fans than I would have predicted, but this only adds to my conclusion that the odds of a boring tribal swap are very slim.

1363234820.0,24,self.survivor,1a9kz6,The Best Survivor Strategy - An Economics Major Perspective,34,10,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/survivor/comments/1a9kz6/the_best_survivor_strategy_an_economics_major/,"I've been thinking since hearing Jeff Probst's podcast with Chuck Klosterman. Klosterman made a good point about the fact that, generally, if every player is making his or her best move, the most average player should win the game. 

In order to be in a position to win the game, a person must be the biggest threat at one point or another, as the biggest threat is the person who would win in a final vote. 

However, especially towards the end of the game, this person should always be removed. So at one point or another, a winning contestant should be the optimal choice to go home (Ideally this would be at the very last moment, when they are in a final 2 or 3). The only way a player who had put themselves in a position to win could survive such a vote is either.

1. Avoiding this until the very end

2. Win an immunity challenge

3. Utilize a hidden immunity idol

4. Persuade others to make the sub-optimal decision

However, number 4 is multifaceted as --

Many players come into survivor either:

A - making decisions based on things other than a simple question: ""What is the best decision for me to make in order to increase my chances at winning the game?"" 

Example: Any talks of honor/loyalty/integrity for reasons other than jury management. 

or

B – More players than not simply are not intelligent enough, do not have enough experience watching the show, or simply do not understand what the best decision is.

Example: Early seasons, many just were not smart enough to grasp how to win the game. Even now, some cast members have never really watched the show so they don't have that experience.

Based on this, the ideal contestant would be some who either naturally or intentionally puts themself in a position where they are never the optimal choice to vote out. 

Voting, generally, is in stages. 

First: Early rounds - vote out weak challenge players to avoid immunity. Therefore, if you are a weak player, your strategy should be to make sure there is always someone weaker.

Second: Pre-Merge - Vote out disloyal strategists who might flip. Therefore, no matter who you are, you want to have someone who appears less loyal to majority alliance than you may be.

Early Merge: Vote out smart players from smaller alliance. Therefore, you should always be in a position of appearing less smart than at least one other person.

Rest of Game: Vote out Jury Threats. Therefore, you need to be less likeable, have had less control, and have played a worse game up until this point than all, but two players.

This is the Nash equilibrium of an ideal player in a sense. Obviously, Survivor is a game where players make sub-optimal choices though, so it does not play this way. 

So basically, a player who has a chance to win can play 3 ways

Strategy A. They keep themselves in a place within the game up until the end where they follow this Nash equilibrium. (This can be both intentional and accidental/luck)
Or
Strategy B. They manipulate players (or play with those who are playing sub-optimal decision making strategies) in order to not be voted out when they should. 
Or
Strategy C. They win immunity (or play an idol) at a time in which they were the optimal choice, and either change their position in the game so they are no longer the optimal choice, or continue to win.

I would say, if someone is playing intentionally to win. Strategy A is the strategy that leaves the game in your control. People who play strategy B or C tend to get more credit, but inherently, their game is flawed, because they SHOULD go home. It takes someone else making a bad choice, or an immunity challenge you are lucky to be the best at, in order for you to win.

So with that being said, I truly think the people best suited for Survivor are not the Boston Rob’s or even the Kim’s. While both were fantastic manipulators, it took poor surrounding players for them to win. 

In many ways, these are really some of the best players.

Sandra: The best type of player one can be. Will never be targeted due to her rough personality and poor challenge ability. Has awareness to point out optimal decisions to those who might not see them.

Sophie: Similar to Sandra with rough personality and poor challenge skills, as well as awareness. A tad better manipulation skills, but a but a tad more explicit in her moves.

Denise: Played strategy A to perfection. Only mistake is that she acknowledges she would have taken Malcolm to the end, where she would have lost. But judging her gameplay by her actions, an almost perfect game.

Cirie: Always is a master of knowing where she stands in a tribe and making sure she is not on the chopping block. Great game awareness. Put herself in the perfect position for fans vs. favorites, only to lose due to the final 2.

I'd be curious to know what people think.

I'm mostly talking about changes to the game, not something like ""better casting"". For me personally I'd make the following changes:

* **No Ponderosa.** Separate the jury members so they aren't able to talk to one another and influence one another after being voted out. All the information they get should come from when they played and tribal councils. I think it would make for more interesting jury votes and final tribals.
* **No handwritten votes.** Have people select a parchment with a person's name typed on it already or something similar. It's a small change, but would make it more difficult for people to figure out who voted for whom.
* **Less sit-out challenges.** One thing I hate is when a team with a numbers advantage is able to sit out their weakest players during *every* immunity challenge. Sometimes we have weak physical players who get away with never having to participate in challenges out of sheer luck (e.g. Abi-Maria). They should have more weakest-link type challenges where everyone has to participate and numbers don't matter. An example of this is an obstacle course a whole team has to run. Or a challenge where people go head-to-head and the smaller team can have people participate twice (they've done this during eating challenges).
* **Bigger money difference between first and second.** Obviously I know from a production standpoint it may not be feasible to offer more money. But at the very least I think they should make the disparity between first and second higher, even if that means lowering the second-place prize. We need more people with the ""first place or bust"" mentality.
* **Less food.** Maybe this is just my false perception, but I feel like on recent seasons the contestants are much better fed. They should be offering way less food prizes than they do and/or going to locales with less fruit and food available. One big point of contention in past seasons was food rationing, and I feel like it hasn't been as much an issue of late. Also, people tend to get much crazier when they are starving.

Malcolm knew that three possibilites were going to happen. 1) SRU votes all on him and calls his bluff about having the immunity idol;Malcolm goes home. 2)SRU splits the votes but Erik and Sherri flip to Andrea; Andrea goes home. 3) the situation we saw play out in tribal. Out of these three situations Malcolm was going home in 2 of them. That's too big of chance to leave in other players hands. 

Now here is how he could have saved himself. He should have voted for Reynold. If SRU split the votes like they did Reynold would go home and Malcolm would have 3 more days to find and idol and have taken out a big challenge competitor. If Erik and Sherri had flipped like he thought they would then Andrea would have gone home. I know some would say this would be jury suicide by taking out his alliance member but I don't think that is true, Reynold appears to be a player that will vote for the best game play and would give credit to Malcolm for attempting to take control of his own fate.

What are your thoughts about this hypothetical situation?


TL;DR Malcolm could have stayed in the game by voting for Reynold

I am really, really baffled by the way she is playing.  Some of it could be edit, but in Corrine's exit interview, she also mentioned how silent Brenda has been.  Apparently she basically never talked to Corrine (2 sentences in 22 days is the way Corrine put it) and basically never says anything to anyone.  As we know from watching, the majority of her screen time has been her challenge dances.

So do we think this is some sort of strategy on her part?  Or is she just lost and doesn't really know what to do, despite her alpha position in her first season?  Does she just not *care* and is just on a camping trip?  It is really baffling.

Here's my theory:  Being too much in control the first time cost her, so her overall strategy coming in was to lay low until that wasn't working anymore.  So far, she hasn't been in any danger, so there hasn't been any need to do anything.  I think (perhaps ""hope"" is more like it) that she is ready to start playing the game as soon as she needs to, but she just hasn't needed to yet.

The danger is that the time that she needs to start playing is quickly approaching, and may arrive before she realizes it.  If Cochran, Phil, Dawn &amp; Andrea really *are* a strong alliance for the final 4, then she's got to make a move before they get down to 7.  Or, of course, be able to split that strong alliance.

She may also have some pre-show alliance that has never been discussed because it hasn't been necessary.  I don't follow the twitters and whatnot of anyone but Parvati, so if anyone else has any insight on who she is close to in real life, that might be an indication.

The weird thing is that not only do we not hear anything from Brenda, but we don't hear anything *about* Brenda from the other contestants.  Obviously there is *some* discussion and *some* semblance of an alliance there because she's always in the loop on who to vote for.  So if she were to make it to final TC, it doesn't seem like anyone dislikes her.  But on the other hand, are experiences players and fans going to respect whatever strategy she might have and give her a million dollars if she never contributes to the game or to the strategy?",,False,self,t5_2qhu3,False,,Brenda,True,t3_1bqvt6,http://www.reddit.com/r/survivor/comments/1bqvt6/the_brenda_thread/,

Those with balanced editing are usually ranked higher even if the outcomes are similar. The reason for this is probably because you get less of someone you hate and more of a chance you'll relate to another castmate. It's one of the main reasons why people like Survivor because its 16 - 20 people from different walks of life coexisting.

Think about the Phillipines you had so many different characters that got good screentime (Malcolm, Denise, Lisa, Penner, Jeff, Pete, RC, Abi, Russell Swan, Carter, Zane, Angie, Roxy)  the only people who were shafted were the Kalabaw girls and Artis. Most people here hated Abi and If it was edited similar to other seasons it'd be Abi would have gotten a NaOnka or Phillip edit and we'd get way too many scenes of her annoying people and many would tune out. The only knock i'd give to the editing is that Lisa got too much God time that could have gone to Skupin, Artis and Carter.

This worked even in seasons without great strategists like Gabon. The final 3 of Gabon had probably the worst strategists ever (Susie the floater, Sugar the emotional wreck and Bob the father figure) but it was interesting as you saw people from many walks of life interacting with lots of perspectives. It could have been 39 days of Crystal Sugar and Randy but instead we got lots of interesting characters with balanced editing.

This is the problem with Caramoan so far the editing hasn't been balanced. Usually they focus on the losing tribe but Julia got nothing till last episode, Hope and Allie were near non existant. Eddie is basically an extension of Reynolds. I don't think I need to say anything about half the faves but they'll probably make it up later on. I like Phillip but he and Brandon got way too much screentime. It hurts the show, it upsets fans and Cowboy Rick a longtime fan was deeply saddened he got no screentime in South Pacific and that man definately isn't a mactor wanting a big break.",,False,self,t5_2qhu3,False,,,True,t3_1auj0j,http://www.reddit.com/r/survivor/comments/1auj0j/balanced_editing_good_seasons/,

I've heard it said countless times that ""it's the best season since Heroes vs. Villains"". And while I agree with this sentiment, it's interesting to look and see why this same fan base disliked (or in some cases, hated) the last few seasons. After all, Survivor Philippines:

-Has returning players (more than any season since 20)
-Has players who have quit the game
-Has its fair share of stupid players

All of which were common criticisms of the last four seasons.

However, I'd like to think we have the collective IQ to realize that these a bad season does not make. Rather, the lack of any apparent straight Paggonging at any point this season has kept the game interesting, while flawed gameplay has been the product of interesting personalities and a ""fortunate"" turn of events that let the editors tell the story as we would like it known (the unpopular players have mostly been voted out by this point, and all the flips have taken place to let this happen).

However, what has lead to this interesting dynamic? Really, it's been flawed gameplay by a lot of the contestants that have kept the game interesting up until now. Pete and Abi's poor social game lead to most of the post-merge opportunities for Penner and Skupin, while Jeff's insistence on eliminating Penner also killed a much more straight forward flip at the Final 11. We also have Malcom and Denise, who should be all but dead at this point if their respective new homes put two and two together and realized there was no way they would have more loyalty to each other than themselves.

Rather, I would suggest that it is the dominating game - the game where one player plays the arguably impeccable social game, runs the board on immunities and is the head of the main alliance (often with an idol they never have to play), that is the *main* culprit for a bad season. Because while you can admire the impeccable gameplay specimens such as Brian Heidik, Boston Rob and Kim Spradlin, the Survivor community has also come to something of a consensus that it was their dominance that has made Thailand, Redemption Island and One World some of the less beloved seasons by consensus.

When looking at these three games, we can easily see where the problem went. Along with the ""We Hate Paggongings!"" speech every Survivor fan trumpets is perhaps the more innate issue with these seasons: past a certain point, not a drop of suspense remained in these seasons. Once those three players stripped their tribes of any dissenters and rode their alliances to the merge, these players merely ran the table on immunities while keeping their tribe mates from mustering a coup, taking the goats of the group to the finals and winning the money. 

Meanwhile, if we take a look at some of our more beloved seasons by consensus, we see something of an opposite. Fans vs. Favourites and Heroes vs. Villains are regarded universally as the best two seasons, and in both the game always hung in the balance every episode. While great players like Parvati and Russell controlled these games for the majority of the home stretch, neither was truly in such a commanding position that their win was inevitable and obvious. When we look at non-All Stars seasons such as Amazon and Tocantins we see the same thing; groups of competent players who exerted enough control to be successful, but never enough to remove suspense (though the best player in both of those seasons lost).

Overall, what do I think this means? That Survivor Philippines has done a lot right. Splitting up the tribes into 3 really helped prevent a natural Paggonging. Casting a large number of aware players also benefitted this more, however. The only way to truly achieve a season of high play and entertainment is *good casting*. Otherwise we have to wait till the All Stars seasons to see any semblance of a season that could be in the serious discussion for being a Top 2 season any time soon.",,False,self,t5_2qhu3,False,,,True,t3_13t0ue,http://www.reddit.com/r/survivor/comments/13t0ue/does_the_dominating_perfect_game_ruin_seasons/,

- The start of the game is a whole bunch of new twists! 20 contestants, individual immunity challenge, no tribes, schoolyard pick, double elimination. More on this below.

- No merge: For the first and only time in Survivor history the tribes never merged. Instead, Koror ""conquered"" Ulong, and absorbed its last remaining member. 

- Fire-making tiebreaker: In the case of a deadlocked vote, and when the purple-rock tiebreaker can not be applied (4 or less people) a fire-making challenge will be the tiebreaker. The first person to build a fire high enough to burn through a rope wins. Season 10 and Survivor finally has its tiebreaker system worked out. 

- Exile Island: Exile Island makes its debut appearance in ep10, but is only used the one time. It is not featured as a full season twist until season 12. 

**The Winner: Tom Westman**

Tom was a strong, charismatic NYC fireman that everyone naturally gravitated towards from the beginning. From start to finish Survivor Palau was Tom Westman's season. He played a near flawless game never receiving a vote against, and coming one vote away from playing Survivor's first perfect game. Tom not only dominated the challenge aspect like none before, winning 5 immunities, but showed that you can also play a strong, controlling strategic game and still be well liked. Forming the game's most solid alliance on day 2 with Ian, and Katie (and Steph), Tom was in a power position from the start. Together with Ian, they make up one of the strongest duos Survivor had/has ever seen. Adding Jenn and Gregg as part of their alliance ensured that Tom would never be in any danger at Koror. Tom took on the leadership role at Koror not only at camp, but in challenges, and it resulted in the biggest Survivor beat down of all time. Behind Tom's leadership, Ulong's lack thereof, Koror coasts through the beginning of the game. After The Conquer Tom is in as good a position as ever. Him and Ian are still running the show with their original Koror alliance, and are now rejoined by their (secret) day 2 alliance member of Steph. Tom makes his first big move with 6 left, when he blindsides his alliance member Gregg. After a whole bunch of crazy stuff his original alliance of him, Ian, and Katie are able to take top 3, and Tom somehow is able to eliminate his closest friend/biggest competitor and go to FTC against one of the biggest goats of all time... Tom does an excellent job at forming relationships with everyone, and creating subtle back-up alliances such as Steph and Caryn. It allows him always see threats coming, and also be in a strong position with the jury later on. Tom also had an uncanny ability to give long tribal answers of saying nothing offensive to anyone while still being honest. gg wp

**CHARACTERS**

- **Tom**: The leader of everything Koror. Dominated physically, strategically, and socially. Had a great bond/alliance with Ian the whole game. 

- **Katie**: Annoying and bitchy to everyone outside of her alliance, and pathetic in challenges and around camp. ""My strategy is to stick with those people that make the decisions, until those people no longer have any power, and then jump to the next person that makes the decisions."" She did execute that strategy, as she was able to align with Tom and Ian from the beginning, but she had no gameplay to stand on and the jury tore her apart at FTC.

- **Ian**: Tom's right hand man from day 2, and the food provider for Koror. He played a solid game and was in a great position until about 7 left. Ian isn't exactly good under pressure though. Never able to lie on the spot, or talk himself out of a situation. After being repeatedly called out and put on the spot at tribal Ian's game begins to unravel, ending in one of the craziest moments in Survivor history. 

- **Jenn**: At times it seemed like she was more interested in dating Gregg than playing the game. In the majority alliance, but not really involved in the strategy game. She starts to turn it on at the end, but loses in a fire making challenge. 

- **Caryn**: Unaligned, and on the outside of Koror for most of the game. She forms a little alliance with Tom near the end which buys her some more time, but ultimately she was not a very good strategic player. She seems to be the reason that an all women alliance never worked out.

- **Gregg**: Strong in challenges and a good strategic player. He is able to control Jenn's vote, but gets a little distracted by her. He is so gung-ho about getting Steph out, and sticking to the original Koror alliance that he never sees his blindside coming. 

- **Stephenie**: The debut season of Survivor's strongest female cometitor. So strong in challenges, dominating anything women vs women, but Ulong is so lost she doesn't have anyone to really play with. She survives Ulong to join Koror, but is never able to get back into the game strategically. 

- **Bobby Jon**: Just brute force, run into a brick wall mentality, no strategy. A ridiculous work ethic, and his strength keep him valuable to Ulong, but he loses a fire making challenge to Steph in the end. 

**What if/Why Moments**

- What if Steph is picked to be on Koror. She already had an alliance with Tom, Ian, and Katie. It would likely result in the four of them running the game and Steph getting to final four.

- Why is there no strategy at Ulong? Just because you suck at challenges doesn't mean you can't strategize. No alliances going on at all. Koror's 7th and 8th members have more game than Koror's top people. 

- Why does Ulong suck so bad? They have two of the strongest female competitors ever in Steph and Angie, and have the young athletic men, but they can't win a challenge. The lack of a leader leads to a lazy camp life. Jeff's ankle injury certainly didn't help, and either did Tom continuously beating down BJ in alpha male scenarios.

- What if at Ulong final 3, it is a 1-1-1 vote? Triple fire making challenge?

- Why don't Gregg and Jenn flip at first vote after conquering Ulong? They had talked about it, and the numbers were there with Gregg, Jenn, Caryn, Coby, and Janu. This was Gregg's chance to take control of the game, but he was too much about sticking with the plan.

- Why no women's alliance at 7 left? In Katie's words it's ""because Karyn sucks"". Partially true, but they had no real relationship with her before this. Steph never even talked to Caryn. Could happen at 5 again.

- Why does Ian jump down and have Tom take Katie to FTC? WTF WHY?! The guilt from Tom and Katie was too much and ""friendship is more important"" according to Ian. Ian's exit has us go from potentially best FTC ever to arguably worst FTC.


**Underlying Themes**

- **Tom and Ian**: Aligned on day 2, the pair had a tight father-son bond from the beginning and made for one of the strongest duos in Survivor history. They combined to win all 8 individual immunities (including the beginning race to the beach) and were on Koror for all 7 tribal immunity wins. Almost every individual challenge came down to the two of them, and that's just their physical game. Strategically the two were in control the whole game. The powerful sub alliance within the majority alliance controlling almost all of the votes. Socially, both did an excellent job at having good relationships with everyone and complimenting everyone daily. The season was their's from start to finish and Ian's voluntary exit denied us of a truly great FTC, though Tom probably still wins. 

- **Janu's drama**: On Koror, winning every challenge and living the most lavish life possible for Survivor Janu is miserable. She started off strong as an athletic, rock climbing Vegas showgirl, but quickly became a lazy, complainer around camp. Day after day Janu laid and cried in the hammock, not caring if she went home. Janu is the first to quit the ""drown yourself"" challenge and becomes the first person ever sent to Exile Island. After hours of trying, Janu is able to start fire. She enjoys her night on Exile so much she returns to Koror a rejuvenated women saying she had come ""full-circle"". At tribal on day 27 Janu tells Probst there is ""no reason"" Koror should keep her and becomes the 4th Survivor quit, but really just the 2nd behind Osten from Pearl Islands imo if you don't count Jenna (mom sickness) and Sue (violated, humiliated, dehumanized and totally spent) from All-Stars.

**Controversial Topics**

- Wanda infamously outs 7 Palau recruits. This was the first season to ever use more than one or two recruits, using 5. My understanding is that Wanda basically thought 7 contestants were models who didn't audition and who producers added to the cast at the last minute. In reality Janathon, Ashlee, Ib, BJ, and Gregg were recruited, while Jenn and Ian were Amazing Race applicants sent over to Survivor. After Palau the number of recruits per season continued to rise, resulting in 17 of 20 contestants being recruits in Fiji.

**Overall Season Rating**

Palau makes a strong case for being a top ten season. A fresh twist to start the season, leads to more Survivor firsts than ever before as Ulong is decimated by Koror. The cast is strong and has plenty of good characters. Palau is seemingly an amazing location, offering the right amount of rain, fishing, and roaming area for camp. There is a subtle military/ww2 theme going on, but it doesn't add much. Pre-merge is so one-sided and a majority alliance dominates leading to a predictable final 3 which may deter some, but for me, I loved to see it unfold. This is the most extreme case a season can get to, and I'm glad it happened at least once. Tom Westman plays a style of game that had never won before by dominating physically, strategically, and socially. He proved it's possible to be in control strategically and still manage a jury. He won a record 5 immunitties, was in the power position the entire game, and one FTC vote away from a perfect game, which is why I rank Tom among the very best to ever play Survivor.

Cochran would have won regardless, he played the best game strategically, with challenge wins and being far and away more likeable than anyone else.   But the FTC to me really suffered from jury poisoning they were coming at it like one hive mind, they all had exactly the same opinions about everything and I think that is definitely a result of them being together at Ponderosa.  

Everyone agreed Sherri did nothing 
Dawn was too mean
Cochran.......want to go for a drink? 

I feel like Phililip if isolated would not have thought that way, Sherri was his little protege.  Reynold and Eddie are too happy go lucky to be that bitter on their own.  
Without Ponderosa would everyone think voting Brenda out was a cardinal sin?  After all, they were all voted out as well.
The end result would be the same but if they were separated you could actually see their personal reactions to the final three.  Not a hive mind developed over drinks at Ponderosa where they were all pissed not to be in the game anymore and formed this narrative together about why the final three suck.


Here is my assessment of the final three
Sherri: did well strategically but was no good socially, in challenges or at FTC
Dawn:did well strategically, ok at challenges, socially made bonds that people interpreted as an indication she would never vote them out and didn't want to win.  Basically weak socially because people don't like people who freak out all the time
Cochran: deserving winner, good socially, at challenges and strategy

You may disagree with my assessment of the final 3 but that is the point, a group of people generally don't have the exact same opinion about three other people.  


Thoughts?  Hive mind created at Ponderosa or if isolated would they all have the exact same feelings? 


EDIT: ""I feel like Phililip if isolated would not have thought that way, Sherri was his little protege. Reynold and Eddie are too happy go lucky to be that bitter on their own.""

What I mean here is not that they would have voted differently.  Likely they would still vote for Cochran but they wouldn't all ask pretty much the same types of questions or have the exact same feelings about each of the three.  Having them all together at Ponderosa forming a unified opinion on the final three doesn't necessarily change the outcome but I think it makes FTC way less interesting.  If you think of Survivor as a social experiment it's as if they are taken out of the experiment allowed to debrief with each other and then put back in for the conclusion.

But what Brenda did tonight was one of the worst things I've ever seen on this show. To make her do something that she was understandably very self-conscious about on a show that will be viewed by millions of people is terrible and some might argue ""Well, she didn't 'make her"", but once Brenda put Dawn in that position Dawn probably thought it might help her get some votes so she did it even though she probably really didn't want to. I just thought it was extremely tasteless and tacky. Yes, we get it Dawn hurt your feelings because she voted you out, but that is a part of the game, Brenda was not playing the game she was just being mean and I don't think her reasoning was valid for it. Now, Dawn has to deal with people mocking her and posting the photo of her on numerous social networking sites just because Brenda got beat in a game where the goal is to beat everyone. Tear her apart on the jury, her not winning the million and having no votes is revenge enough, not embarrassing her on a public forum.

Edit: I just also wanna make the point that is really irked me that Jeff kept trying to get an apology out of Dawn. What the hell is she supposed to be sorry about? Voting Brenda out of the game?

- It's no secret Jeff and the producers wanted Russell to win Samoa and felt he was robbed by a bitter jury. The jurors that vote for Natalie to win in Samoa all got pretty poor edits, either underedited with a negative tone (Laura, Jaison, Dave, Monica) or getting an invisible edit (Kelly, Brett), with the jurors that voted for Russell (Shambo and John) getting slightly better edits. 

- The entire Zapatera 6 all got lower visibility unsympathetic edits, arguably as punishment for voting out Russell early, and preventing a post-merge Russell/Rob clash which the producers were obviously hoping for.

1334262753.0,22,self.survivor,s6qu4,Another season that could fall victim to Panonging,23,1,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/survivor/comments/s6qu4/another_season_that_could_fall_victim_to_panonging/,"Pagonging: When one tribe systematically votes out all the members of the other tribe after the merge. 

The result: After the members of the other tribe are voted out, the ""ring leader,"" who typically has a Hidden Immunity Idol, takes two goats (people who have no chance of winning) with them to the final 3.

Begin rant:

It got me to thinking why we have this recurring theme of Pagonging on Survivor. Then I started to look at the cast. Lately, it seems like the typical Survivor season has this contestant mix: 8 or so attractive people who seem to have been recruited at night clubs, a few token older people, a few token minorities, and one or two token gay men or women.

It's rather well known that Survivor recruits some of their castaways each season from places such as night clubs or wherever attractive 20-somethings hang out. Lately, the casts seem to be filled with more and more contestants who fit that ""recruit"" mold. The portion of people who applied through CBS.com seems to be decreasing over time.

Look at this season. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe we only have two people who are self-proclaimed Survivor fanatics - Colton and Troyzan.  Although the former was a racist bigot, they both played harder than anyone else on this show besides maybe Kim. Isn't that a bit fishy to you? If someone went through the effort of applying through CBS.com and going through the whole screening process, interview process, and physicals, don't you think the majority of those applicants would be Survivor fanatics?

Think about it. Colton's love of Survivor was seen as being a big deal. Tarzan and Jonas cried when they found out about Colton leaving because it was supposedly so unique that Colton loved Survivor. Last season, Cochran's love for Survivor was seen as some kind of oddity. Shouldn't most of the people on the show be diehard for Survivor freaks who are willing to do anything to win? Cochran, Colton, and Troyzans tenacity should be the norm and not the exception. ESPECIALLY, when you are picking 16 people out of an enormous pool of applicants. 

Instead, we have a season where only 3 people are showing any non-engineered, true emotion with this game. The rest are just kind of going through the motions. Look at Russel Hantz. The guy would cry when he was voted out. He loved the show that much. Look at Boston Rob. He cried several times because of his love for the game. Yet for some reason the producers are casting 13 or so people each season who could give two shits about what happens.

Maybe if the producers picked people who actually wanted to be on the show so bad that they applied through CBS.com -- you know, the method that most people think they use for recruiting contestants -- the show would be more interesting to watch. You would have a season full of fighters, but instead, half of those 8 or so contestants they are recruiting from night clubs end up being goats. It makes the final 3 boring because the show is formulaic.

Instead, we are force fed season after season of this engineered mix of contestants. Of this mix, there may be two or three people I like, while before I used to like over half the castaways. I think it's due to the disappearing reality element of Survivor. Survivor, like all reality TV, is becoming more unreal over time. I'm sure there's some term to describe that phenomenon, but I'm too lazy to look it up.

More to the point, the use of HIIs has become too predictable.  I like the unexpected turning-a-game-on-its-edge that HIIs bring, but they are starting to feel as though their placement and retrieval is contrived to sway the game.  I would like to see HIIs switched up in some unexpected way.  Here are my brainstorms.  Add your own.

1) One idea for pre-merge: you may not play the HII for yourself, but rather must give it to a player on the opposite tribe.  There would have to be some mechanism whereby the person who found the HII has instructions to leave a signal for production.  Once that signal is received, production knows that the next challenge will be the pre-planned reward challenge.  That challenge would have the winning tribe choose two members of the losing tribe to join reward.  If the HII holder was one of the winners, Jeff would surreptitiously call on that person to be one of the people selecting a player, and some other winner picks the other.  All non-winners would be sequestered together under some pretense.  That way, winner or loser, the HII holder has opportunity to pass the HII to a member of the other tribe.

2) HII's cannot be played for yourself, but when the other tribe loses the IC, the HII finder can relinquish the HII to save one member on the other tribe.  The other tribe gets blind-sided by this, voting as usual; Jeff doesn't make this announcement until after votes are read.  If the person saved by the HII receives the most votes, Jeff makes the reveal.  If not,  a) the idol goes back in hiding on the original beach, or b) the idol is somehow(?) given to ""Renee"" for future use, or c) ?

3) Pre-merge - HII clues are hidden in reward challenges.  This would have to be a ""taking turns"" type obstacle course challenge with stations.  For instance, in the first station, you are supposed to dig for puzzle pieces or the like, but there is also a sign at that station that gives you instructions for finding a clue elsewhere.  You'd have to walk away from the sand-pit with your team watching, wondering why you're abandoning the challenge to go attempt to retrieve the clue (maybe it could be in an underwater compartment that you have to dive for or something).  Each player has to decide whether attempting to retrieve the HII clue in full view of the tribe and potentially at the expense of the challenge win is worth it, and how much time to divert before losing too much advantage to the other tribe.

4) This one is just a something that popped into my head and I haven't analyzed whether it has merit or not.  Post-merge - Eleven players join the jury.  Instead of HIIs, players find Excused-from-Jury-Duty cards.  Players who find them can play them at tribal to dismiss a Juror.

Improved:

Boston Rob (This is obvious. Was a wise cracking narrator in S4 who became a legend after All Stars where he dominated the game)

Parvati (Was viewed as just a hot flirt during Cook Islamds but came back for Micronesia and won while heading the most dominating female alliance this game has seen)

Jerri (Survivor's original villain gained a lot of respect when she was literally seconds away from winning Heroes Vs Villians)


Shitted:

JT (Played one of the most dominating games in Survivor history but handing over an idol to the opposing tribe did nothing to quell the talk that Fischbach was calling the shots in Tocantis)

Skupin (A Survivor icon who was known for being the biggest reason why Astrailia's pre merge was so great but then comes back as a bumbling and delusional idiot)

Stephanie (America's former sweetheart was made out to be a self centered bitch in Guatamala and was shown to have a poor end game)

1354992747.0,18,self.survivor,14iacj,Applying for Survivor? Why CBS prefers recruits over applicants,22,4,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/survivor/comments/14iacj/applying_for_survivor_why_cbs_prefers_recruits/,"Have you seen the average application video? Assuming Youtube submissions are representative of most fans, here are the reasons why applicants suck and why casting relies on recruits.

**1)Survivor wants characters**
Describe any iconic player. When you describe Boston Rob, you don't say he used to be a construction workuh, is a fathuh, and lives in Pensacol...uh. You say he's dominant, controlling, charismatic, assholish, etc. It's the same with any player. They are defined by their characteristics and not any superficial qualities of boring home-life.
 
Somehow the average applicant seems to think that describing the mundane details of daily life makes them an attractive candidate for the game. They brag about things/places they have been/done/seen as if that is a substitute for who they are as a person.

Older men wax poetic about their kids and white-collar jobs. Older women strive to show how fit they are. College students regale their high school accomplishments and newfound social finesse. Daring twenty-somethings boast how “if I can survive this, I can survive anything!”

Recruits are helpful in this regard because casting can actively select a particular character they want for a cast. Recruits can be a specific role (jock, nerd, underdog, outcast) instead of a useless ""everyman"". If everyone claims they are “socially, mentally, and physically perfect for Survivor”, then no one is.
 
**2)Familiarity breeds contempt**
Survivor fans are annoying. Some players can turn their encyclopedic knowledge of the game into an endearing quality, but most are insufferable know-it-alls. And as Micronesia (and undoubtedly Caramoan) shows, being a fan doesn't make you interesting or capable. 
I imagine that hearing the (copyrighted) Survivor theme hundreds of times warrants an immediate rejection by casting. The intense discussion of the current season suggests ridiculous self-importance on the part of the applicant; as if casting cares/isn’t aware of anything you can possibly share about the game.

The worst offenders waste valuable application time lecturing about game strategy instead of setting themselves apart as a potential player.Recruits, however, usually lack familiarity of the game. With a recruit you have a blank slate and someone who can elaborate on life experiences rather than the game.

**3) Storytellers**
Survivor relies on confessionals to see how a player is thinking. What is a confessional but a story? The fact is: most applicants don’t know how to tell a story. They can give fragmented and disjointed segments of themselves playing sports or rolling in the snow, but they are clueless on how to give a coherent narrative.

The people that have success throughout casting are those who can sit down and engage strangers with a story. There are exceptions, of course, but this is the number one reason why highly edited and polished videos are unsuccessful.

1353597172.0,21,self.survivor,13mes1,Penner's strategy,24,3,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/survivor/comments/13mes1/penners_strategy/,"I noticed a lot of people wondering what the Hell Penner was doing saying no to Lisa and Skupin, who turned around and formed a final 4 alliance with Malcolm and Denise. It's being considered Penner's first bad move of the season, but I think I understand why he decided to do that.

For starters, it was already mentioned that he's said he wanted to play honest. He told Abi, every one of the five people in his alliance has tried to backstab them, and he doesn't trust any of them, but they trust him. If he said, ""sure I'll be in a final 3 alliance with you"" and then circumstances forced him to vote them out, that's 2 votes he doesn't have if he makes it to the finals. This way he can say that he was honest with them no matter what happens, he keeps his hands clean and he's not suckered into an alliance that he might have to break.

But I think it goes deeper than that. Penner's really smart and he's clearly had a good handle on how this game's been playing out. We saw last night (through some great editing) that all it would have taken was one vote (Skupin) to flip the game over again and vote out Malcolm, giving the power back to Abi and Pete (at least some of it). Obviously it wasn't going to happen and the show was just trying to make us nervous, but there's a scenario that was very possible that could have forced something bad to happen.

Pete won reward and he was fresh for the challenge. Obviously it didn't play out as he wanted to, but let's say he did win. Him and Abi are immune. Malcolm has the idol, so going against him would inevitably come back to him like it did when Lisa tried it and he'd play it and stay in, so there's no point going after him. That leaves voting groups of Denise and Malcolm and Pete and Abi that are safe, making Skupin, Lisa, Penner and Carter the potential targets. Carter is sort of a wildcard and while he's a physical threat I don't think they'd target him. 

But the other three? Lisa would certainly be a target for Pete and Abi, same for Skupin because they're both willing to make wild crazy moves and in their eyes they backstabbed their alliance. Penner always has to be considered a threat so if he goes with the two people that have the attention of the voting block, then he's in trouble too, instead of being able to get closer to Malcolm, Pete or who ever. 

So not pledging allegiance to Lisa and Skupin could hurt him in the final six, but it was a dangerous move for him to make when the next two votes, as he said, should be fairly straightforward.

So that's how I see Penner's reasoning for what he said to the two when they approached him. Will it lead him further in the game? Probably not, while I'd love to see him in the final I think it's Malcolm and Denise's game to lose, but I think he'd be happy with final six either way.",,False,self,t5_2qhu3,False,,,True,t3_13mes1,http://www.reddit.com/r/survivor/comments/13mes1/penners_strategy/,

Kim played, by all accounts, a perfect game. I can't think of any other survivor that has done this, except for Rob on his fourth go-round. She put herself in the middle of five-people, creating two groups of three that each believed they were going to the end. And she told each group that she was lying to the other group. This is textbook winning gameplay and she executed it perfectly. Plus, she was earnest and real enough that even those that she voted out were willing to vote for her in the end.

As for characters, you had Tarzan, the fairly smart and mature yet really quirky older guy. Kat, the naive crazy girl who ends up experiencing enlightenment after being voted up (when has that happened, ever???). Troyzan, the textbook ego-maniac. And of course Kim, the collected glue that holds an alliance together for longer than almost any in the history of the show.

The final tribal is often so bad and so full of bitterness that my wife and I literally don't watch it (DVR, fast-forward).  This one wasn't bad, people were respectful and to-some degree even introspective about the whole experience. The poison of Troyzan's bitterness didn't spread among the jurors.

1373729628.0,20,self.survivor,1i7ypt,Survivor 1-8 Awards Breakdown,32,12,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/survivor/comments/1i7ypt/survivor_18_awards_breakdown/,"Welcome to the Survivor 1-8 Awards! There will be 3-4 nominees and a winner for each category. I am the judge and the jury on this, so I am sure there will be some disagreements along the way, but this is just for some hypothetical fun! The winners will be listed at the bottom.

**SHOW AWARDS**

**Best Challenge**

- **Final Immunity, Borneo**: The original final immunity. Nothing, but a battle of focus and willpower. Hatch boldly drops out early, while Rudy and Kelly battle for hours. With all of America anxiously watching, Kelly outlasts the former Navy Seal to earn FTC.

- **Final Immunity, Marquesas**: After two crazy, unpredictable tribal councils, an all women final 3 battle it out on the often used challenge. Of the three times this challenge was used, this was the best. All three women last for hours before Kathy loses balance. Vecepia becomes the first person to to ever strike a deal at a final immunity challenge, as she breaks her deal with Kathy and steps off to give Neleh immunity under a promise of FTC.

- **""Contact Zone"", Thailand**: The first time someone had ever been disqualified from a challenge, as Sook Jai self destructs getting 4 people dq'ed. The best being Robb Z grabbing Clay around the throat and tossing him into the water. 

- **Stand on a perch in the water, Amazon**: A challenge used in many seasons, but none stand out as much as this seasons. The original temptations challenge where Probst offers up food if you jump down. Jenna and Heidi strip naked for peanut butter, chocolate, and coke. 

**Best Premiere**

- **Borneo**: Never before had something like this happened. 16 contestants are put on a tropical island with minimal supplies. The first ever challenge, the first ever tribal, this is where it all began.

- **Amazon**: A gorgeous cast is immediately separated, men vs women. The women are clueless around camp, struggling to make fire or build shelter, but ultimately win the first immunity challenge to send a guy home first.

- **Pearl Islands**: The contestants start with the clothes on their back and are sent to a fishing village with 100 Balboas. The difference in tribes is staggering as Sandra's spanish speaking gives Drake a big advantage. A unique start centered around a pirate theme. This premiere had so many little moments like Rupert stealing shoes, Sandra trading her gold chain, the Morgan men getting naked, and more!

**Best Final 4 On**

- **Borneo**: Hatch and his alliance all make it to the final four and now have to turn on each other. A great final immunity, Sue's epic 'snakes and rats' speech, and Hatch finishing off a great game.

- **Marquesas**: The one and only purple rock tiebreaker at final four sends Paschal home. Vecepia breaks a deal with Kathy and gives Neleh final immunity. Our first bitter jury! After a slow season, at least the final four was good.

- **Amazon**: Jenna vs 3 men, Rob C trying to snake his way into FTC. Jenna wins final two immunities to make FTC, and chooses Matt over Rob C. A women is crowned the winner of battle of the sexes.

- **Pearl Islands**: A misfit collection of unaligned players, it was anyone's game. Darrah finally loses immunity and goes home. Lil kicks Fairplays ass at final immunity and then takes Sandra to FTC. Sandra wins her first game of Survivor. 

**Craziest Nature Moments**

- **Skupin, Australian Outback**: Skupin kills a wild baby pig. People have caught wild chickens and even a few sharks, but there has only been one pig hunt. 

- **Wild Animals, Africa**: Lions prowl around the tribes boma fences, they come face to face with a cape buffalo. This and the water situation made Africa wild!

- **Fire, Amazon**: The merged tribe shelter burns down after Butch became obsessed with collecting firewood.

- **Hatch, All-Stars**: Richard Hatch catches the first shark in Survivor history. The shark bites him on the arm, he bites the shark, then smashes its head on a rock. 

**Worst Twist**

- **Outcasts Tribe, Pearl Islands**

- **Purple Rock Tiebreaker, Marquesas**

- **Fake Merge, Thailand**

**Best Twist**

- **Tribe Swap, Africa**

- **Men vs Women, Amazon**

- **Surprise Start, Pearl Islands**


**TRIBE AWARDS**

**Worst Tribe**

- **Pagong, Borneo**: Though they held their own in the pre-merge, with no gameplan or unity at the merge, the Pagong tribe was picked off one by one resulting in the original 'Pagonging'.

- **Samburu, Africa**: The original Samburu tribe was instantly divided 4v4 by age and work ethic. The younger, lazy 4 win the tiebreaker at tribal and gain control, resulting in one of the worst camp lives Survivor had seen. They also broke pretty much all of their canteens and water pots which didn't help in Africa.

- **Sook Jai, Thailand**: Things started strong for Sook Jai, who was the younger more physically fit tribe. Poor camp life and a lack of a leader leads to the downfall of Sook Jai. Sook Jai loses 7 straight members to result in the second Pagonging.

- **Jaburu, Amazon**: The original Jaburu women were struggling with camp life. A mostly lazy attitude results in no shelter for almost 9 days. They struggled to start fire with flint and kerosene, and had no luck fishing. However, the Amazon women did win 4 out of 7 challenges.

**Best Tribe**

- **Tagi, Borneo**: They were unified under Richard Hatch and it resulted in them taking the top 5 spots of season 1. There camp was complete with a kitchen, and separate hang out area. Hatch became the original food provider.

- **Chuay Gahn**: Led by Mr. Freeze himself. Not a very strategic bunch, as they all trusted Brian, but they stayed unified and took the top 5. They were unaffected by the fake merge and it allowed them to easily eliminate Sook Jai.

- **Drake, Pearl Islands**: Drake dominated the beginning of the game by winning the first six challenges overall. They made out amazing from the fishing village which led to an excellent camp life. Rupert consistently provided plentiful amounts of fish. All was going good until they threw a challenge.

- **Chapera, All-Stars**: Unified under Boston Rob, the original Chapera doesn't lose a member until day 12. They build the best shelter Survivor had ever seen, complete with benches and a swing, and had a family like bond. They stay completely unified taking 6 of the top 7, and all of the top 5. 

**Best Alliance** (These are my made-up names that I use to keep track of them)

- **The Founders, Borneo**: The original alliance, led by Hatch with Rudy, Sue, and Kelly Wiglesworth. All made the final four.

- **The Big Three, Africa**: Lex, Big Tom, and Ethan make the earliest, most solid alliance the game had seen. They take 3 of the final 4 spots and Ethan wins the season.

- **The Fair Five, Marquesas**: Kathy, Paschal, Neleh, Vecepia, and Sean team up as the underdogs with 9 left and coast to the final 5. 

- **Romber, All-Stars**: Boston Rob and Amber controlled the game from the beginning, dictating who goes when. The closest pair Survivor had ever seen, they had deals with just about everyone at some point, and they both made FTC.

**INDIVIDUAL AWARDS**

**Best Pre-Merge Player**

- **Skupin, Australian Outback**: Skupin was the leader and food provider for the dominant Ogakor tribe. If not for his accident, Skupin easily makes the merge (with numbers) and possibly goes far.

- **Shii-Ann, Thailand**: A victim of the fake merge, she had survived being in the minority throughout the game and was in place to join Chuay Gahn. Instead her scheming backfired.

- **Burton, Pearl Islands**: After stupidly throwing a challenge, Burton is the first member of Drake to leave. After returning to the game, he proves he is a strong strategic player as well as physical.

**Best Runner-Up**

- **Colby, Australian Outback**

- **Matthew, Amazon**

- **Rob, All-Stars**

**Best Hero**

- **Colby, Australian Outback/All-Stars**

- **Elisabeth, Australian Outback**

- **Paschal, Marquesas**

- **Rupert, Pearl Islands/All-Stars**

**Best Villain**

- **Richard Hatch, Borneo/All-Stars**

- **Brian Heidik, Thailand**

- **Jonny Fairplay, Pearl Islands**

- **Boston Rob, Marquesas/All-Stars**

**Worst Strategic Move**

- **Colby, Australian Outback**: Colby takes Tina to FTC instead of Keith, and loses a 4-3 vote.

- **Clarence, Africa**: Clarence takes two cherries instead of one, and then opens a can of beans when the rest of the tribe is at the watering hole. Basically ended his game with this.

- **Lex, All-Stars**: Lex votes off his ally, Jerri, instead of Amber to please Boston Rob. At the merge, Rob immediately votes off Lex.

**Best Strategic Move**

- **Hatch, Borneo**: Richard Hatch creates the first alliance.

- **Paschal, Neleh, and Kathy, Marquesas**: Realizing they are on the bottom, they flip on their Rotu tribe at 9. Something unheard of at the time.

- **Fairplay, Pearl Islands**: Lies about his grandma dying.

**Best Winner**

- **Richard Hatch, Borneo**: Ahead of his time strategically, Richard was willing to lie and create alliances to advance himself in the game. 

- **Brian Heidik, Thailand**: A masterful liar, who had everyone on his tribe trusting him. Always in control he won without ever receiving a vote against.

- **Sandra Diaz-Twine, Pearl Islands**: Voting with whoever was necessary, Sandra makes FTC despite being laughable at challenges. In the most competitive season at its time, Sandra lied her way to a blow out win without ever being voted against.

The first few seasons, I feel like there were lengthy clips about how the players were obtaining food, dealing with the elements, and what the living conditions at the camp were like. (Ex. iconic moments like Skupin killing that pig, Tom killing that shark. Also, I recall them showing Ozzy going fishing all the time.) Now, it seems like the show only focuses on what is directly relevant to the strategic game. They only show something related to survival if it serves to explain strategy (like showing Penner going fishing in Phillipines after the challenge where they traded rice to explain how people felt about him and create tension to make us think he was leaving.)

So, has the show in fact been showing less survival stuff or am I just remembering the older seasons too fondly? Do you guys think the survival aspect makes the show more interesting?

Here are a few others:


* Sliding puzzle: So many times I've seen challenges involving sliding puzzles. Go download a sliding puzzle app for your phone and get good at it.
* Untying knots quickly
* Staying in the same position for an obscene amount of time: standing, standing with one arm up, hugging a pole
* Neurolinguistic programming
* Climbing trees : if you can't climb, you'll miss out on potential HII hiding spots
* Stacking things: stacking up to reach a level, stacking a row and knocking it down domino's style
* Train your memory: Again, download apps. Some challenges require you to remember numbers or to memorize the order of things. Some basic mental arithmetic is occasionally helpful (As S18 Stephen can attest to)
* Making a long rod out of many short sticks + lots of string
* Bowling: Yeah, seriously.

- The castaways do not get any rations of food to start. Also, tribes are never given fire as a reward, having to always rely on a magnification glass.
- The first tribe raid in Survivor history. It only happens once, but it was valuable.
- Starting this season you are aloud to give your immunity to someone else. It doesn't play a role in this season, but this rule change later leads to two of Survivor's craziest moments (Fiji and Micronesia).
- The purple rock tiebreaker is introduced this season. This is the only season where the purple rock tiebreaker has to be used, but it still remains the tiebreaker for any deadlocks outside of the final four.

**The Winner: Vecepia Towery**

The first minority winner. Vecepia sums up her strategy in an ep4 confessional saying, ""Stay drama free, it's the way to be. If my name isn't in it, than I'm not in it. When drama starts, I walk away."" She does seem to have a high amount of confessionals in the early going for not doing much. I think this is because she is never on camera for anything interesting so they have to go back and get her reaction/opinion. Vecepia is arguably the first person to win by really doing it on her own. She was never overly loyal to anyone other than Sean, and did a good job of forming personal relationships with everyone. She seems to do a great job of telling her group, ""I'm with you"", while clearly separating herself as an individual and bonding with everyone. Originally she puts herself in a good position with Boston Rob, Sarah, and Sean. After the merge she in the minority, but never truly on the chopping block. At 9 people left Vecepia aligns with Sean, Paschel, Neleh, and Kathy to form what I call ""The Fair 5"", and they are able to easily ride this to the final 5.

**Characters**

- **Vecepia**: Stays drama free and waits to be approached for strategy. Pretty much always in a good spot and never in danger.

- **Neleh**: A sweet girl that everyone loves. Is this Elisabeth 2.0? Even her relationship with Pashcel is reminiscent of Rodger. Her game was ""don't cause waves"". She also says ""oh my heck"" all the time.

- **Kathy**: Takes on leadership role early and it hurts her socially. She then mellows out and fits in much better. She was always on the minority and could never find her rock solid ally. The original preacher of ""it should be fair"". She was the founder of the Fair 5, but she was still the odd one out. 

- **Paschel**: The patriotic judge that everyone loved. Such an endearing relationship with Neleh (and Gabriel early). The innocent victim of the infamous purple rock incident. He never had a vote against him, was part of the strongest duo, and well liked by everyone left at 5. Dude got screwed.

- **Sean**: Wanted to be the alpha male and was never afraid to speak his mind. Forms a tight bond with Vecepia over being black. 

- **John**: The leader of Rotu's power alliance of him, Tammy, The General, and Zoe. Desperately wanted to be the food provider. Not nearly as smart as he thought he was.

- **Boston Rob Mariano**: The first of four seasons for the Boston construction worker. Shows his strategic prowess from the beginning, putting himself in a power position on Maraamu. The tribe swap really hurt his game this season separating him from his pawn vote Sarah, and he wasn't able to recover. Boston Rob's Survivor strategy: Find someone (a girl) who will vote how you tell them. Loyalty above all.

**Season Summary**

**Start of Game**: The least amount of starting supplies ever at this point. Tribes are each given 2 machetes, 2 empty water containers, 2 cooking pots, 1 frying pan, 1 fillet knife, and 1 magnifying glass. No food rations. Jump off the boat with your supplies and paddle 2 miles to shore.

**Pre-Merge**: Completely dominated by Rotu who win the fist 4 immunities and first 6 challenges overall. Hunter thinks he is running the Maraamu tribe because he works hard at camp, but really Boston Rob is with Sean, Vecepia, and Sarah.

**Tribe-Swap**: Everyone gets a new buff at random. The original Rotu comes out with the numbers advantage on both tribes. Neleh, Kathy, and Paschel take over Maraamu while John, Tammy, General, and Zoe maintain power at Rotu. Sarah is separated from Rob and her alliance and is the first to go. Kathy comes out the big winner in all of this, as she was never very close with John's alliance. The swap instantly puts two more people under her in the pecking order and buys her enough time.

**Merge**: John is the leader of the power alliance at the merge with him, Tammy, General, and Zoe until they clearly lay out to everyone that it's the 4 of them vs the others. For the first time in Survivor, the people on the bottom join together to take out the power alliance at 9 left. After John goes The Fair 5 ride it out until only they remain.

**Final Immunity**: Same as Africa. Stand with one leg on each stump while keeping a hand on the idol. Not the last time we see this challenge either. Kathy falls off first and Vecepia immediately strikes a deal with Neleh that she will jump off if Neleh takes her to FTC. This sorta goes against the deal Vecepia made with Kathy at the previous tribal, but whatever only Kathy seems to care.

**FTC**: Vecepia makes it clear that she did not ride any coattails to get their and that she stuck to her own strategy while preaching her strong personal relationships. Neleh meanwhile praises god, talks about how loving she was to everyone, and tries to stand on her strong move of flipping with Paschel at 9 left. Our first bitter jury! All four members of John's alliance still believe they played the better game and deserve to be in the finals. Tammy really lays into both finalists saying how they lied/manipulated just as much while hiding behind religion. I wouldn't say it was decided going in, but everyone sort of votes how I would expect. John, Tammy, and Robert are too bitter at Neleh for flipping at 9, and formed better relationships with Vecepia. Those 3 votes plus Sean supporting his longtime ally is enough to win. John is the deciding vote as he seemed to be the only vote that was undecided going in. The difference might have been Vecepia handling a tough jury with strong, confident answers, while Neleh struggled with the simplest of questions, such as Kathy's ""Why should I vote for you?"".

**Craziest/Funniest Moments**

- Sean describes Sarah's arrival on the raft as ""Cleopatra"".

- Maraamu starts fire on day 1 with a magnifying glass. Quickest in Survivor history at this point. Rotu gets it on day 2.

- The original Maraamu start their days with a morning radio show hosted by Sean featuring Hunter on weather, Rob on food, Tammy on sports, and Sarah on beauty.

- Kathy pees on John's hand after he gets stabbed by sea urchin after several others get stage fright.

- The ridiculous nono bug bites!

- Rob ""The General"" slices his toe pretty badly on a rock. Same episode John gets bit by an eel. You never know when these kinds of injuries will get infected.

- Kathy gets Maraamu lost on a tribe hike. Sarah gets annoyed and wants to go back to camp but can't find her way.

- Sean blows up on Gabriel because the Rotu tribe is work, work, work all the time.

- Ep5 has the first ever Survivor camp raid, but it is out of control! Grab anything, and everything you want in two minutes. Huge reward for the four Maraamu members to win which directly leads to them winning the next immunity.

- The final 4 Maraamu members become expert crab catchers.

- Rob gets Zoey to lie to his face about her alliance, then gets John to confirm it just to try and start drama.

- Final 3 Maraamu members find a human skull buried nearby.

- Rob confronts Zoey and gets her to lie again, this time in front of Kathy.

- Sean has a bad case of the farts.

- After John gets voted out, Zoe tries to save face with everyone by making them shell jewelry. This bitch lied to everyone and it came off as so fake.

- Paschel tips $200 on his dinner reward using Probst's credit card.

- The purple rock tiebreaker at final four. Paschel never has a vote against him, but goes home after drawing the unlucky purple rock after a deadlocked vote. 

**What if/Why Moments**

- What if Gabriel joins Boston Rob, Vecepia, and Sean at the first Rotu tribal? (aka what if Gabriel decides to play the game?) It only creates a 4v4 tie, but for Gabriel that should be better than going home. If it stays deadlocked then maybe we get to see the purple rock tiebreaker in action, and then maybe production realizes it doesn't work at four people.

- What if Kathy doesn't win the first individual immunity challenge? Her name is floated a lot, but it is hard to tell if it would actually be her. 

- What if there is no pecking order challenge? Without this challenge Paschel never wakes up and realizes there is an alliance of 4 and Sean goes home at tribal. This likely leads to John's alliance dominating like they thought they were. 

- Lots of what ifs for Kathy at the final 5. If she doesn't win immunity she could very well be eliminated since she doesn't have an ally. Does she make the right decision in sending Sean home? It is hard to imagine a scenario that doesn't involve a deadlocked final 4. I do think she should have broken up Paschel and Neleh, with her best bet being voting off Neleh at 5 and attempting to get with Paschel, and Vecepia against Sean. Ultimately she puts herself in a very good position, but Vacepia sort of double crosses her at final immunity. 

- What if we have a fire making contest at final four like they were supposed to? Kathy vs Neleh, on paper this is all Kathy, but you never know. This seemingly would set up a Kathy and Vecepia final.

- What if Neleh takes Kathy to FTC? This is a stretch because Kathy was considered a favorite at that point, it would mean Neleh totally breaks her word with Vecepia, and it probably results in a Kathy win. I think Neleh made the right choice, she just didn't have the game to win over a jury. 

**Underlying Themes**

- **Location**: Season 4 was originally scheduled to be filmed in Jordan for Survivor: Middle East, but the location was changed after 9/11. The new location of Marquesas is one of the worst we have seen and has been ruled out for all future seasons because of the nono bugs.

- **Religion**: Religion comes up in this season more than any other. Everything is praise god/god is good. Lots of prayers especially by the two finalists. Tammy slams them at FTC for hiding behind the veil of religion while they lied and manipulated.

- **""It should be fair""**: It's the principle that the majority alliance of Vecepia, Sean, Neleh, Paschel, and Kathy is based upon. Leads to a pretty honest and straightforward post-merge.

**Interesting Season Notes**

- Maraamu's water source is a small rocky creek bed, while Ravu gets a sweet waterfall lake. Maraamu's beech has way more food in fruit and crabs though. This kind of camp trade-off is used in the next season, Thailand.

- Fire is never given as a reward in the form of matches/flint this season.

- Rotu wins the first 4 immunity challenges of the season. The largest immunity streak to start a season until Koror win all 7 in Palau, and Moto wins all 8 in Fiji.

- Rotu wins the first 6 challenges overall. The largest winning streak to start a season until the Drake tribe of Pearl Islands who also won 6. The Moto tribe wins the first 9 challenges of Fiji.

- Ep5 has the first camp raid in Survivor history as a reward for the blindfold challenge.

- Gina doesn't win a challenge until day 13. I'm not positive, but this could be the biggest individual drought to start a season until Denise from the Philippines who doesn't win until day 15.

- Ep8 had the first ""pecking order"" challenge. Such a good challenge that plays a huge role this season. Also becomes a common recurring challenge in future seasons.

- This is the first season where everyone's loved one is there in person.

- In all of the first four seasons, the person who wins final immunity and gets to choose their FTC opponent, picks ""wrong"" and loses. Brian in Thailand is the first to win final immunity and the jury vote. 

**Controversial Topics**

- The purple rock tiebreaker. If the votes are deadlocked, the two people receiving votes become immune, and the remaining tribe members now become vulnerable and have to draw rocks from a bag, whoever draws the purple rock goes home. A fine tiebreaker, but it doesn't work with only four people left! With someone holding individual immunity, and the two vote receivers becoming immune that would only leave one person available to draw rocks. I repeat, it doesn't work with four people! Instead the final four tiebreaker is supposed to be a fire buidling contest between Kathy and Neleh. The producers use the purple rock tiebreaker anyway, making Neleh, Kathy, and Paschel all draw rocks. Paschel gets the purple rock and goes home without ever getting a vote against him. So essentially, the producers used the wrong tiebeaker at the wrong time, and then used the wrong rules for that tiebreaker! Huge, horrible, ugly mistake in Survivor history that completely alters the games outcome. This makes 2 out of 4 seasons (and back to back) that producers have messed up the final 4 and changed the outcome of the game.

**Overall Season Rating**

Marquesas ranks very low in my Survivor season rankings. Marquesas is certainly nothing special as a locale and has no truly entertaining characters after Rob leaves. The Fair 5 made for boring tv, and were so incontrol that much of the merge was quite boring. Any and all schemers were eliminated early which led to most of the votes being a forgone conclusion.  While Vecepia does a nice job of creating relationships with all of her tribe members and consistently positions herself in the majority, she never really has to make a big move and her strategy is one that I think would only work in the earlier seasons where there are more people who are willing to ""play fair"" and take the most deserving to the end. Overall I rank Vecepia pretty low in Survivor winners unofficially around the 20-26 range.

**Medallion of Power**: A dumb idea that never resurfaces in other seasons. When played a tribe receives an advantage at the challenge. Advantages like these almost always result in a victory which is too powerful. The Medallion was retired after 4 episodes.    
**Old vs Young**: Exile Island had 4 tribes divided by age and gender, Gabon had the oldest  people be captains, but never before was it divided straight up Old vs Young. It was a twist that dictated the entire pre-merge, but once merged had no lasting effects.


**Winner**
**Jud ""Fabio""**
- A careful observer may have been able to predict this in episode one. Fabio is the first castaway to appear on camera as well as have the first confessional. Later in the first episode Fabio says in confessional ""I don't care what they call me, I'm gonna win the million dollars""
- **His Game:** Fabio is on the minority alliance from the beginning with the young people. He is constantly on the chopping block as the one to go not this time, but next time. Jud decides to fade into the background as the guy who everyone gets along with and by the merge is completely off the radar. While never making any big moves Jud's biggest point in the game was winning 3 straight immunities from final 6 to final 3. It is the only way he makes the final 3.


**Characters**


- Fabio: The winner. Definitely played dumber than he was
- Sash: Tried to found the Minority Alliance, but it just never stuck. He lied and had deals with everyone. It cost him at FTC not receiving any votes.
- Chase: Biggest paranoid ever. Made his own alliances mad by constantly freaking out over strategy. This guy could not answer a question at Tribals to save his life and it cost him in the end losing by one vote.
- Jane: The North Carolina girl that everyone loved. No strategy, too much of a threat to take to FTC, but gave lots of great moments. Also wins Sprint Player of the Game by the largest margin ever.
- Brenda: She was in such a good position at the merge. Her problem was she was ""with"" both the people that had HII, but didn't actually have one for herself. 
- Marty: The only original Espada member with any strategic game play, but way to vocal about his strategies.
- Naonka: One of the craziest characters to ever play. And it all ends in a quit?! With a HII?! Naonka was one of a kind...
- Purple Kelly: Purple Kelly makes this list because she may be the dumbest person to ever play survivor. She gets little to no edit, but her few words make you realize why. Brenda's voting pawn and clueless when it came to any strategy she quits on day 28.

  
**Season Summary**

  
**Pre-Merge**: Pre-merge is dominated by the young La Flor tribe. Brenda, Naonka, Chase, and Sash form the power alliance leaving Fabio and others on the outside. Meanwhile at Espada, the older people have zero clue what strategy is and are playing the game based around who do we like at camp? Marty is the only older person to form an alliance getting Jill, Holly, and Dan who all say, just tell me who to vote. At the tribe swap the lack of strategy from older people becomes apparent as the lose control of both tribes.     
**Merge**: After the merge the theme of this season becomes, no alliances whatsoever. Brenda and Sash had control for a little while, but Naonka and Chase flipped. Holly, Chase, Jane, and Sash had control, but lost it. There was no such thing as loyalty this season, and that helped Fabio in the end as he was always in the minority alliances and never had to betray anyone.


**Craziest/Funniest Moments**


- First tribal for La Flor, Shannon repeatedly puts his foot in his mouth ultimately asking Sash ""Are you gay?""
- Holly fills Dan's $1400 shoes with sand and throws them in the ocean. In the same episode, Naonka loses a sock, and subsequently steals Fabio's extra pair.
- Naonka goes ""hood"" on the handicapped Kelly B. after a reward challenge to get the clue to the HII.
- Jane catches her own fish, makes her own fire, and eats it herself in the woods.
- Naonka steals the tribes flour, bowls, frying pan, and fruit because no one appreciated the tortillas she had made. Alina becomes an accomplice by sharing the fruit and is then voted out.
- Marty gives Sash his HII for the promise of 2 more tribal councils. Sash gave him one more and then voted Marty out. 
- Naonka and Purple Kelly quit on day 28
- The Libertad camp burns down. After stacking 3 wooden chests around the fire and going to a challenge the camp is ruined, losing the tarp, rice, machetes, among other things.
- Ep13, Jane finds out she is going home so prior to leaving for tribal council she poors 2 buckets of water on the fire saying, ""If I started it, I'll put it out"".


**What If/Why Moments**


- After the tribe swap why does Alina stay loyal to Naonka and the young people? She was clearly on the outs with Chase and Naonka yet stayed with them to vote out Tyrone and Yve. She is then left with no alliances at the merge and is the first to go. Meanwhile at the La Flor tribe, Jane is put in almost the exact same situation. She was originally on the outside with Marty and Jill so she teamed up with the young people and made it to 6th.
- What if Brenda, Sash, Chase, and Naonka stayed strong as an alliance. They then have the only solid four in the game and both hidden idols. In a season of no strong alliances, this seemed like the likeliest one.
- What if Naonka and Purple Kelly don't quit on day 28. Naonka has a hidden idol and becomes a candidate for ""take me to the end, everyone hates me"". Purple Kelly could be used as a pawn for a couple more votes, and Fabio could become a target. Neither would ever win, but it would change some things. This event also leads to a Survivor rule change stating that producers can remove quitters from the jury.
- What if Chase didn't suck so bad at answering tribal councils. Throughout the season he blunders his strategy in front of Jeff and the jury, but the FTC is bad. Going in I think he had a shot, but he loses it in two questions. First, he refuses to answer Marty's ""dumb as a bag of rocks award"" question, actually insulting Marty in the process and losing his vote. Second, Fabio gives one of the best answers to a jury question ever. Naonka, asks him about his mom and his motivation. Fabio responds with an emotional answer that brings Naonka and jury members to tears. With this answer Fabio steals Naonka's vote.


**Underlying Themes to the Season**


- The weather: This season and season 22 RI are filmed in Nicaragua. While seasons 19,20, 23, and 24 are in Samoa. This seasons rain in Nicaragua seemed to be some of the worst Survivor has seen, eventually causing 2 people to quit. Flooding seems to make fishing impossible and food really runs thin this season.
- The previews for ""next week on Survivor"" became a string of ""what will Naonka do next?"". She stole all the tortilla supplies for camp and people barely even cared. Only Naonka could get away with this stuff.
- Was this season's cast constricted to a tiny camp area? Every time people are talking strategy, it is either within earshot of shelter or you can see other people in the background. No one this season seems to ""take walks"" or ""go get water"" and it resulted in a few interrupted conversations at camp.


**Overall Notes**


This Season is placed in an awkward spot. Survivor was on such a high since around season 13, and had just come off their best season ever with HvV. While seasons after Nicaragua start to become meh and filled with returnees. For me, Nicaragua probably falls somewhere in the middle of the 27 seasons. Not great, but not bad by any means. Fabio's laid back style probably hurts him in the standing of Survivor winners though. Imo the Pre-merge lacked any real strategy and the new twist of Medallion of Power was dumb. The Merge was lackluster, and no one player ever really emerged. The winner, Fabio, never had to make a big move, or a real strategic decision.

The mutiny episode is great, but from there it just kinda simmered out. I know a lot of people love this season and it always gets ranked pretty high and I'll never understand why. Yul played a good game, but it was not a particularly exciting one to watch and yeah Ozzy was a beast at the challenges, but none of them had any suspense because of it.

As a viewer, I don't like Dawn because she constantly loses her shit and has been responsible for taking out some of my favorite contestants.

But, if you look at it from a pure, unbiased, gameplay standpoint I think a good case can be made that Dawn has been *the most critical player* this season. And, if she makes it to the final 3, it's hard to argue that she didn't make the *right* decisions.

Starting right after the merge, Malcolm and Corinne had a brilliant plan to turn the game. Corinne made the huge mistake of confiding in Dawn and then Dawn, facing a pivotal decision on which side to go with, ended up being responsible for eliminating Corinne without giving away that she was doing it. If Dawn goes the other way and sides with Corinne/Malcolm, Malcolm, Eddie, Reynold, Corinne and Michael would likely have rounded out the final 6 - a virtual total reversal from who actually made it to 6.  That decision basically set in motion the votes for the next 5 weeks (minus the blindside of Andrea and Brenda).

The next week, Malcolm repeated Corinne's mistake and trusted Dawn a second time. When you think about it, it's pretty remarkable that Dawn was able to orchestrate a blind-side of Corinne without Malcolm figuring out that she was the information leak. She basically blindsided the same alliance twice in a row. Andrea saved Dawn from making the mistake of targeting Malcolm that week, but it probably would have worked if Phillip wasn't so bad at hiding his intentions.

This past week, Dawn found herself as the pivotal vote *for the third time* when she was in the position to decide between Brenda's alliance and Cochran's. If she goes the other way, Eddie and Cochran are likely gone and she's in the Final 4 with Eric, Brenda, and Sherri.

The entire game other contestants have been looking at Dawn and thinking she's at the bottom. The reality is that no one has had more power and been more responsible for shaping the game than Dawn. There is no more powerful position in survivor than being the swing vote and Dawn has been in that position three times since the merge. The only other players to be in that position, even once since the merge, are Eric and Sherri the week that Malcolm got voted out.

If you take out all of her dislikable qualities, it is really hard to argue against Dawn from a totally unemotional gameplay standpoint. If she makes it to the end, she will have proven that her choices were correct strategically, especially considering the difficulty of beating Malcolm or Brenda at FTC. She's the only player in the game that has had multiple chances to change the course of the game - everyone but Eddie left in the game owes their survival to Dawn - the same can't be said in reverse.",,False,self,t5_2qhu3,False,,,True,t3_1e4x1y,http://www.reddit.com/r/survivor/comments/1e4x1y/devils_advocate_on_dawn_recent_episode_spoilers/,

With the trend of taking a patsy to the end, isn't it unusual to have 9 players left who all would at least have a *reasonable* argument at FTC?

I think we'd all agree that Sherri is the clear #9 and someone that the other 8 would like to sit next to at the end.  But she'd still have a legitimate (although, likely unsuccessful) argument for the win.  She's been on the ""outs"" pretty much continuously and had her game plan completely upended when Shamar got medivac'd.  To fight through for 39 days while constantly being in jeopardy - compared to several others who have never really been in danger - is certainly a valid argument.  And while Eddie &amp; Reynold have a bit of animosity toward her, it doesn't seem that extends to the rest of the tribe.

Outside of her, the brolliance is liked - and perhaps even respected - by the remaining tribe.  Everyone is treating it as a game and understand where the lines are drawn, but no one seems to have animosity about it.  And the SrU core of Brenda, Erik, Cochran, Dawn and Andrea?  We've certainly got no indication that any of them are disliked by anyone else - much less a majority.

I find it interesting because we could actually go into a final 3 with 3 people who all have a *legitimate* chance, and *legitimate* argument for winning.  Plus you'll have a jury comprised of people who respect the game and (so far) don't seem to have a lot of animosity toward the finalists.

It truly could be one of those season where you have to **win** the game, and not just take the right losers with you to the FTC.

I feel like at least Matt and Sherri will make it far, and if Reynold plays his cards right he will too. They have the potential in my mind to be prospective returns.

Matt showed some great tact and strategy playing nice with both sides and using his alliance with Michael (that Michael initiated) to control his stake in the vote. I think he could have easily swayed Michael to vote with Reynold, Allie, Hope, and Eddie if he'd wanted to. 

Sherri did a great job buttering up Shamar. I think he's pretty much in her pocket and that is definitely something I didn't expect from her. She's a sneaky one.

And Reynold, while making some questionable decisions, did a good job with the situation he was in with the whole immunity idol thing. If he plays it right he could squirm out of this and do really well.

As for the rest of them, I hope something big happens with Julia soon, I like her for some reason. Michael started out well, and I feel like we'll see some good gameplay from him in the future. Eddie, Laura, and Hope haven't really stuck out to me at all. I'm hoping they will but I'm not getting my hopes up (insert joke about Hope here). And Shamar, if he quits being a 300 pound toddler and actually plays the game, he'd be pretty awesome. Needless to say, I'm disappointed by his performance this far. But really, he's the only one I've been that let down by. The others have met or exceeded expectations.

Do you really want to ask me a serious question...or just want to try and be a tough guy?
I'd be happy to talk to you one on one anytime.
I'm NOT bitter (as many of you fans think I am)...but I also don't just sit back and smile if someone steals something from me.
You watched about 10 hrs out of 936 hrs that were filmed. Do you really think you KNOW the whole story from my season or any other season for that matter?
My guess is that you don't...but I may be wrong...it's just a guess
I'm really happy that people (fans) such as yourself are soooo interested in this show. I LOVE Survivor just like you..crazy passionate for it!!
Hope to meet you one day in person!
All the Best...

   *I hope someone reads this and understands how deeply pained I am by what I saw on your network last night. I am emotionally devastated by last night's episode of SURVIVOR. This show is by far my favorite television of all time; I have seen every episode, I own too much memorabilia to count, and everyone who knows me knows me as a huge fan. I however, had a visceral reaction to last night's episode ""bum-puzzled"". The actions and attitude displayed by Colton Cumbie were absolutely disgusting, and it saddened me deeply to see someone deplorable as him be put onto the national stage. I know that this is not a scripted show, and that CBS could not control the words that came out of his mouth, but I am thoroughly disappointed that your network would allow such a hateful person to be featured on one of your shows. I understand, too, that you love to cast contestants we love to hate. The Fairplays and the Russels are prime examples of ""SURVIVOR villains"" for whom the viewers tune in week after week to revel in their backstabs and betrayals. Colton however, has taken villainy beyond the game. He called a black man ""Ghetto trash"". He called a little person an ""oompa loompa"" and a ""munchkin"". It has literally caused me physical pain to listen to Colton's hate speech throughout this season. I can't help but worry that the casting agents knew he would be this intolerant and spiteful, and that disheartens me deeply.

- One returnee per tribe. Former contestants return to compete against rookies for the first time. Something that was a unique twist until the more recent seasons of Redemption Island, South Pacific, and Philippines.

- Hidden Immunity Idol. Ep8 marks the debut of the HII. The HII must be played before the votes are read and is never re-hidden. The rules of the HII continue to evolve over the seasons. 

**The Winner: Danni Boatwright**

Danni admits on a Survivor Oz interview that she purposely hid her strategy so that producers could not interfere on her plans, which makes her difficult to judge. Despite seemingly being involved in almost everything, Danni is given a very under the radar edit. Her strategic confessionals amount to repeatedly neutral comments like, ""I don't know what to do"", ""I don't want anyone to go."", and ""it's such a hard decision"". She is a strong, athletic female competitor which immediately puts her in a good position on her original Nakum tribe. While the men are in charge, Danni seems to be the highest ranking woman on the tribe. After the tribe swap we get to see some of Danni's gameplay. Despite being up 4-3 in numbers on the new Yaxha, Danni votes out her ally Blake to gain the trust of Gary, which proves important later. She retains being in the majority on Yaxha as she is allied with Brandon, BJ, and Gary. At the merge Yaxha is down in numbers and all of Danni's male allies are eliminated. As the sole surviving Yaxha member, Danni is up against 5 former Nakum. Danni's second big move came at 6 left. Seemingly next to go, Danni wins a timely immunity and is able to bring Rafe and Lydia on her side. Still needing Steph's vote, Danni manipultes Judd and Steph's relationship to put doubt in Steph's mind and gets her to flip on Judd. Her name is still floated around and she is still the odd one out a little, but after surviving the vote at 6 Danni finally has a chance. This is also reflected in her obvious confessional increase, though she still never reveals anything useful. She is able to form close friendships with Rafe and Steph to get her to final 3, where she wins final immunity. Danni chooses Steph to go to FTC and wins in a 6-1 vote. 

**CHARACTERS**

- **Danni**: She hid her game strategically, but was always a strong female competitor. In the minority for most of the post merge, a clutch immunity win saves her.

- **Steph**: Returning from the previous season in Palau, Steph is still obviously strong in challenges, and this season she takes over strategically as being the leader of the majority. Steph does a good job staying in control throughout the game, and along with her closest ally, Rafe, they are making the decisions of who goes. In the end the jury was made up of those she had betrayed and it cost her. She also came across as much whinier/bitchy than in Palau.

- **Rafe**: The unlikeliest of challenge threats, Rafe wins 4 individual immunities. Well liked and in the majority the entire game, Rafe operates as Steph's right hand man. Letting her take the heat, Rafe does an excellent job at forming bonds with everyone and is in a great position all the way until final 3. He is also affected throughout the game by his morals and doing what is right.

- **Lydia**: Hopelessly optimistic and positive, she never stopped smiling. She was in the majority for most of the game, but only as a +1 and never really had a close ally. 

- **Cindy**: The zookeeper was a fierce competitor. She was part of the Nakum majority for the post merge, but never really had any power, and after Judd was blindsided she was alone. 

- **Judd**: The loud alpha male who had a bit of a temper on him. Forms a tight bond with Steph after the tribe swap, which sets him up in the majority through the merge. Blindsided by her, he leaves to some of the greatest closing words of all time. 

- **Gary**: A former NFL quarterback, Gary lies about his name and occupation. He is a natural leader for the original Yaxha, and ends up being well liked by everyone. Gary is the first person to find and play the HII, but is still eliminated by the Nakum majority.

- **Jamie**: Loud at challenges and paranoid around camp. Jamie was in the majority, but could not relax. His constant paranoia wears on his alliance and he is cut loose sooner because of it. Has a rivalry with BJ throughout pre-merge.

- **Bobby Jon**: Returning from Palau, BJ is wrecked early by the opening hike. After he recovers he becomes the same brute force work horse from Palau. In the majority on his pre-merge tribes, he makes the jury by a favor from Steph.

- **Brandon**: A farmer from Kansas who you couldn't help but like. The only male Nakum not to be killed by the opening hike. He wanted to play a straight and honest game, and was the first victom of the Nakum numbers at the merge. 


**What if/Why Moments**

- Why is Guatemala the forgotten season? One of only two seasons (One World) to never have a player return, season 11 is certainly overlooked. One of the problems with this season is that there is no narrator. The story is there, with Danni overcoming the Nakum majority, but normally it is the winner who is narrating the journey along the way. Well Danni decided to hide her strategy which led to zero useful confessionals from your winner, which led the season to center around the story of returning player Stephenie (and BJ). The narration turned into a tale about how Steph lost more than anything else, which obviously makes a season less memorable. The cast is another problem. While everyone who made the merge is a solid ""B"" character, none of them are that ""A+"" character that can carry a season.

- Why don't BJ and Steph work together? The two had more of an annoyance for each other, rather than using their previous relationship to their advantage. They weren't together until the merge though, and the numbers never really made too much sense for it. If Steph was going to get him onto the jury she should have at least gotten him to guarantee her his FTC vote.  

- What if Danni takes Rafe to FTC? The deal was in place, an I'm not really sure how it plays out. Steph kept suggesting that her and Rafe played the same game, but I disagree. Steph came out way worse in terms of the betrayals as she was much closer to Jaime, Judd, and Cindy. Rafe also had stronger relationships with the jury on a personal level. I'll still take Danni to win, but I think Rafe gets at least two votes. 

**Underlying Themes**

- **Playing vs Rookies/2nd Chance**: BJ and Steph are invited back to compete in a season of all rookies, the first time this had ever happened. This almost always proves to be an advantage, and Guatemala is no different. BJ and Steph were idolized in the beginning and were looked at as immediate leaders, which put them comfortably in the majority. Steph came back ready to do whatever it took to win, which worked up until FTC. BJ came back with the same work ethic, but again wasn't the most strategic guy.

- **Surviving Guatemala**: The opening challenge of an 11 mile hike was one of the toughest ever, and left several contestants dehydrated for days. Temperatures were well over 100F and they weren't allowed to swim because of crocodiles. Everyone was beat up, with open sores all over there body, and ridiculous amounts of mosquito bites. This and the lack of additional food sources led to very lethargic camp life.

- **BJ vs Jaime**: ""Southern people, we're crazy and we know it."" Representing Alabama and Georgia respectively the state feud spills over into Survivor. Jaime was loud at challenges and BJ wanted to let him know that there is ""another bear in the woods"". The two almost came to blows during the boulder challenge, but after BJ hurts Jaime's feeling by saying he has no class the two seem to turn a corner. By the reunion they have totally made up and become friends.

**Overall Season Rating**

The narration centering around Steph's return and failure, rather than Danni's victory detracts a bit from her great comeback. A Mayan theme throughout is cool and living in the ruins is remarkable, but on a whole the location actually subtracts from the season. Ridiculous temperatures, no secondary food sources, no swimming, led to a camp life reminiscent of Africa. The twist of returning players was unique and interesting, but gave Steph and BJ an advantage. Overall, Survivor Guatemala is a bit bland and unmemorable with no crazy events or classic characters, which is why I place it towards the lower half of my season rankings. Danni admitted to hiding her strategy from the cameras which makes it challenging to judge her game. She was clearly a strong female, winning two immunities and always ranking high in her male dominated alliances. Her comeback is one of the better ones ever, but the narration would have you believe it was more of a Nakum collapse. In the end, judging with what little we have, I place Danni somewhere in the back half of my Survivor winners.

I think this is largely due to the fact that we had a master of strategy (Yul), and a master of the physical (Ozzie).


**Yul's** gameplay was, just as everyone has mentioned in this sub, flawless.  I was blown away by how easily he navigated through the game, while at the same time working the jury votes.  Not only could he easily motivate and manipulate people, but every time there was a confrontation he  managed to play it down.  By the end of any confrontation someone had with Yul, they liked him more by the end of it.  He just deflected everything so calmly and efficiently there really wasn't any big fights.  By the end of a game it wasn't even a contest, and there really weren't even any close calls with him.  His use of the Idol was ridiculous -- he didn't even have to play it to get the benefit from it (though, the Idol was OP that season).  Still, I would love to see him back at some point.  Really impressive to watch (so much so, that it took away the entertainment factor for me).

**Ozzy** also impressed me this season.  I had only seen him in South Pacific.  What impressed me about him was his physical gameplay -- Ozzy straight up dominated against seemingly much larger, stronger, and in shape men.  Ozzy looked like this scrawny surfer dude, but he won so many challenges that again, it was almost a forgone conclusion that Ozzy would make it to the end.  

**Penner** is one of my favorites to play survivor.  He is very eloquent, and scathing when he wants to be.  I love him on the Jury for his questions.  That being said, this was his first season and it showed.  He was thinking the game out extremely well, his problem was he was overtly strategic.  This did not mesh well with many others who were doing the same thing he was, but with secrecy, and those who just wanted an Island adventure and did not want to talk strategy.  His biggest mistake (aside from fostering mistrust from EVERYONE) were the people he allied with in the beginning -- Flicka and Candice.  Neither of them were trustworthy people, and he misjudged their character.  I would have loved to have seen how it would have played out if he stuck with his original tribe.


So, the overall point here is that I was very impressed with Yul, and agree he was probably one of (if not THE) best strategical players survivor has seen.  Him and Ozzy were just so dominant, it was almost boring to watch though.

I noticed a lot of people were nominating their favorite characters to watch, and not necessarily the best players. (not excluding myself, I did nominate Shane, LOL) Well, lets make this one a popularity contest!

So all you Tyson, James, Crystal Cox and Russell Hantz fans, here where you can upvote your favorite ""crazies"" to your hearts content! Because fact of the matter is, as fun as these guys are to watch, chances are, they'll never win survivor.

I will post each season of Survivor as individual comments and people will reply to each season comment with their own personal contestant from that season. If you see your favorite, upvote them. Think they were boring? Rather not see them again? Downvote!

I will take the top 3 from each season and add them to a bracket which I will post and everyone can vote on. I'll post the link to the bracket in this post and in its own post so it can be easily found.

Rules!

* Please include the full names and nicknames of contestants that you are nominating!

* Only players from their original seasons can be nominated. All-Stars and HvV will not be options to nominate from and for the seasons with new and veteran players (Guatemala, Micronesia, Redemption Island, South Pacific, and Philippines) only the new players can be nominated.

* If you wish to give a reason behind why your nomination should be upvoted make it a reply to the nomination post and do not include it in the nomination post itself. You can also comment on names suggested by others users and spark a debate. Debates are good: This is the internet, you can never have too much debate!

* I will wait a few days for the votes to come in and then I will get the bracket set up. (Actually, I'm just gonna follow exactly what the other post is doing.)

* Feel free to base your nominations off of the contestants games in all seasons they take part in (shit, Penner gets funnier everytime!), but only nominate them in their original season. The only reason I chose to keep returning players in season from getting nominations was to give every contestant an even chance of being nominated. So nominate based on all of the games they've played, but they can only be nominated in one post to keep it fair.

If you see your favorite already listed, feel free to add another favorite of yours in addition to upvoting your first choice. Surely there's more than one contestant from each season that you liked. Let's see how intense we can get this competition. Defend your case by replying with examples of their awesomeness. Best of XYZ videos are appreciated!

I couldn't believe the audacity of Kenny's continued whining about Bob (one of the most likable winners EVER) not giving him his immunity necklace, knowing that he was planning on voting him out.  I liked Crystal from the beginning.  I found Susie fairly under-rated.  She was definitely a huge game-changer.  All Marcus had to do was promise her the final three and his entire alliance would NOT have been picked off one by one.  I thought Charlie crushing on Marcus was cute.  And I actually liked Corinne (who is coming back next season) until her horrible comment at FTC about Sugar's father.  That was completely un-called for.  

A fairly entertaining season and pretty under-rated in my opinion.  The location was just so-so to me, kinda dry and boring.  At least it wasn't another faceless topical island.

Everyone tripped over themselves to tell me to watch ""China"" and ""Micronesia"".

Just finished ""China"" last night and I LOVED it!  So many likable characters, James and Courtney being my absolute faves.  Courtney was a riot.  ""Todd and Amanda don't understand.  It's not that I like them, I just hate them less than everyone else.""  And I loved how even though James was blindsided pretty bad, he laughed about it after and congratulated them and held no hard feelings.  Truly a classy guy.  I get so annoyed when people are so damned butt-hurt at the final tribal council.  On the flip-side Dave and Jean-Robert were both nutjobs and it was so fun to watch them get taken down.  And Todd stroking Jean-Roberts ego for his vote at the final tribal was one of my favorite moments.  I also loved the transition from taped show to live show in this one.  It's small, but it was cool when Jeff sd ""I know you want me to read these votes now...  and I willl  BECAUSE WE ARE LIVE IN HOLLYWOOD!""  I seriously missed the transitition and thought it was cool.  Also, it's so rare that the truly deserving player is so young and likable and actually WINS in the end.

The only negative I had was the location.  Though I'm glad it wasn't yet another boring tropical island, I found the camp nothing short of GROSS in this one.  It was all mud and muck.  I also dislike it when they aren't given the clothes they brought.  It's just a stupid thing to do and I don't like watching everyone hang out in their underwear.  I'm not a prude, it just kinda grosses me out and makes them look sloppy and nasty.

You guys might have remembered Survivor Chronicles ORG being advertised here, I was one of the contestants along with a few other redditors on here. Overall the game was amazing and after the game came to an end I started work on making my own Survivor ORG with a redditor I met through Survivor Chronicles 2. We worked hard on making an incredible season and we can't wait to see how the game turns out. 

Let me give an explanation on how exactly a Survivor ORG plays out. A Survivor ORG is an online reality game held on a custom forum, in our case a custom made Yuku forum. Just like how the CBS hit reality show Survivor plays out, you will meet your cast, get placed on a tribe, compete in challenges and of course go to tribal council. Everything and anything you would see in Survivor is possible in our game, there is always the possibility of finding a few twists. All of this is done through our forum and AIM but there has been cases in past ORGs of tribes meeting up on Skype. 

The game will last about six weeks but you won't need to be online all the time, we would just ask that you log in once a day just to see if there is any new tree mail or keep up with your tribe. Some of the challenges will be played live in which you will need to be present but we will make the time challenges are played flexible to accommodate everyone if possible. 

We're looking to start in about two weeks so if you have any questions or concerns feel free to contact us at:

* #1 on the list, they need to bring back Jeff's James-Bondesque entrance to the reunion show.  It was great in the first few seasons when they did the live reveal, but then they ditched it.

* Why can't I remember the name, but I'll call it Isolation Island.  I think they could bring that back occasionally, but tweak it so they can't just keep sending the same person over and over again.

* More true survivalism.  Gervase was eating fucking rats on the first episode.  I want to see rat eating again.  Hell, this past season they had a fucking pig at camp and never even tried to kill it.

* A longer reunion show (or run a second hour a week later in the same time slot).  The reunion show is always rushed.  By the time they run ads and go through the votes, there's really only about 30 minutes of actual reunion show.

* Surprise 2 person finale every few seasons would keep the kids on their toes.

* Bring back endurance challenges (like keep your hand on the idol).
 

**Things they cat ditch (or keep ditched)**

* Never bring back redemption island or anything like it.  Once the tribe has spoken, you're gone.

* Get rid of that damn fallen comrades tribute.  They're gone, I don't care.

* I'm probably in the minority, but I've had enough of the hidden immunity idols.  If they *must* have them, they *need* to make them harder to find.

I just finished Gabon for the first time (wow, great season!) and I thought it would be fun to go back through each season and discuss the winner, what we liked about the season, what we hated, etc etc. Plus it might keep things lively around here since the current season is almost over. So, what do you think?

Edit: So, there seems to be a pretty good response! However, there seems to be a split between the format I suggested, and a episode by episode discussion- basically a rewatch of each season.

I was a little below #400 in line and about halfway down, it still took me ~3 hours (got there an hour early and then 2 hours to get called). All in all an enjoyable experience.

For those considering attending future casting calls (such as the one in Denver next month), here's my experience to use as a baseline. Once I was called in, it's you, a camera, and an interviewer (mine looked like she worked for the local CBS affiliate and not Survivor casting). The interviewer read off around three questions from a list, which included:

* What's your name/where are you from?
* Who is your favorite Survivor and why?
* Why do you like watching Survivor?
* Why do you think you'd win?
* How do you live aspects of Survivor in your everyday life?
* Anything else you'd like to say? (sometimes asked at the end, I didn't get asked this)

There may have been others but I didn't hear them. All in all it took about a minute, and then I was done. Obviously you're going to want a good camera presence, enunciation, and a lack of ""um"" and ""uh"" in your answer.

1374349425.0,15,self.survivor,1ipl7i,Survivor 9 Vanuatu Breakdown,29,14,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/survivor/comments/1ipl7i/survivor_9_vanuatu_breakdown/,"**New Twists**

- Men vs Women! For the second time ever, tribes are divided by gender to start the game. Compared to the Amazon cast, Vanuatu's seems much less beautiful, and a more accurate splice of America. 

- Double Tribal: Both tribes go to tribal on the same night and both tribes vote someone off. Technically this happened in Pearl Islands after the Outcasts won the immunity challenge, but that was unusual circumstances and could have been avoided. This is the first season that makes it mandatory that both teams will go. Something that becomes a common twist in future seasons.

**The Winner: Chris Daugherty**

""I had a dream that I would be playing the game the way I am, lying, deceiving. You aint got no choice, because I tell you what...You don't step it up, and you don't start playing the game in your best interest to benefit and go to the end, you'll be sent packing. Going home with a million bucks...That will change your life."" Not since Brian Heidik of Thailand had someone been able to lie and deceive so much, yet be so trusted by everyone. Chris was very good at evaluating situations and not letting any one sneak by him. He always covered his bases and had others to watch his back. When in the power position, Chris handles it perfectly. Chris was a gifted speaker, always subtly dancing around direct questions to give non-offensive answers. He does an excellent job at getting people to feel like they are the ones making the decisions, while secretly always being in control. When down to the women after the merge, Chris realizes his only way of surviving is pleasing the women. He realizes the game is never over, despite being in a disadvantageous position. Once he gets the power back in his favor, Chris does a superb job at setting up his end game. Forming several close bonds, and then putting those people on the jury in a way that they still voted for him. Chris actually costs his tribe the first immunity challenge, seemingly making him the obvious first target on the guys tribe. Instead, Chris rallies the older men of Lopevi and targets the younger, more fit guys. Chris's mentality is summed up in his confessionals saying, ""I prepared to come here mentally, I prepared to play the game"", and, ""I might be weaker than you physically, but I am stronger than you mentally."" A lesser player is the first person voted off. The 5 men alliance of Chris, Sarge, Bubba, Chad, and Rory keeps Chris safe until the tribe swap. After the swap, Chris is never vulnerable, but makes the mistake of voting off John over a women which leads to a 6-4 women's advantage at the merge. At 7 left, Chris is the last man standing along with six women. He pleases the women and plays patiently until the women change the game themselves. With Scout and Twila on his side, Chris finishes off one of the unlikeliest, but best games that had ever been played. 

**Characters**

- **Chris**: Constantly lying and deceiving, but well liked by everyone. Completes one of the biggest comebacks ever with a perfectly executed end game.

- **Twila**: Her game took off after she was able to interact with the guys. She played both sides for most of the time saying, ""I'm willing to play however I have to play this game to get ahead."" Twila swore on her son's life that she would stay loyal to the women, but flipped soon after with Scout and Eliza to save Chris. 

- **Scout**: The eldest women, and seen as a well-liked leader because of it. She flipped to take out the women's alliance. Had a tight alliance with Twila from beginning to end. A bad knee/hip made her the worst challenge competitor of all time.

- **Eliza**: A strong physical and mental player. She was on the chopping block almost the entire time, which led to one of the most sporadic and unpredictable games of all time. At the first Yasur tribal she sides with the elder women to take out a younger girl. Then she tries to flip back with the young, but someone else does the same thing to her. At the tribe-swap she wants to keep guys, but stays with the women, but then eventually flips to align with Chris. Eliza has a constant feud with Twila and Scout, but is in an alliance with them from 7 on. Eliza played a great game to stay alive and make final four, but ultimately Chris turned on her.

- **Julie**: The biggest flirt of the season, but also a decent strategic player. Her manipulation of Twila partially leads to the women's dominance post-merge. Similar to Eliza, after putting her trust in Chris, he puts her on the jury.

- **Ami**: The leader of the all women alliance. A strong competitor who got a bit cocky with the power after the merge. Felt betrayed by Eliza who she had protected. 

- **Chad**: A nice, respectable, good guy. Probably the most level-headed and logical thinker of the guys. A leg amputee, the first to compete on Survivor. 

**Season Summary**

**Start of Game**: Everyone goes through a real rite of passage tribal ceremony. The Vanuatu natives divide the contestants by gender and clearly treat the men as superiors to the women. The men are given kava to drink, a brown liquid that apparently tastes like mud and gives you quite the buzz. A live pig is brought out and slaughtered. A spirit stone is placed on top of a poll that is greased with pig fat. Brady is chosen to retrieve it and does so no problem, which seemed pretty impressive. The tribes then have a long hike to camp in the dark. At camp is 1 machete, 1 pot. Pretty cool start.

**Pre-Merge**: At Lopevi, the older, more out of shape men band together and vote off the young, athletic guys. This gives Chris, Chad, Sarge, Rory, and Bubba the early power, with Sarge as the face of the alliance and Chris as the strategy behind the scenes. The Yasur women are divided by age and work ethic. Eliza originally sides with the older group to give them power. Ami seems to be in the most control, while Scout is seen as a leader. 

**Tribe Swap**: The tribe swap puts Rory and Bubba on Yasur with 5 women, while putting Julie and Twila on Lopevi with 4 guys. Ami fights to keep the Yasur women strong, but they do sacrifice Lisa over Rory. At Lopevi, Chris, Sarge, and Chad decide to take in Julie and Twila, and vote off John.

**Merge**: It could be 5 new Lopevi vs 5 new Yasur, but really it is 6 women vs 4 men. Rory is ready to flip and give the new Lopevi the advantage, but Julie and Twila stay strong with the women and vote out Rory. Ami and the women control the power until the only guy left is Chris. At 7 left, Eliza, Scout, and Twila, realize they are on the bottom of the women's alliance and flip to save Chris, resulting in one of the unlikeliest final fours. 

**Final Immunity**: Hold a bow and arrow in a warrior pose, while balancing on two stumps. Focus, balance, endurance, a bit of strength. To say Chris was favored in this challenge might be an understatement. Scout goes out first after releasing her arrow. Chris tries to get Twila to step down with a deal, but after she tells him no chance it turns into a bit of trash talking, with Scout obviously routing for Twila. Twila releases her arrow after about an hour. 

**FTC**: Chris says he deserves it because of the odds he overcame as the last man. Twila says she played hard and played to win, and that she worked hard to earn the win. Eliza begins FTC by calling both Chris and Twila deceptive bitches, and then asking for an apology from them. Twila denies everything, calls Eliza names, and won't apologize. Chris gives a  ""sincere"" apology that is the perfect answer, 1-0. Julie breaks down immediately over Chris, still heartbroken he betrayed their brother/sister friendship. Chris again responds well, saying their friendship was true and that he is sorry and hadn't planned on hurting her. Another perfect answer, even getting emotional during it, 2-0. Leann targets Twila for the promise on her son's life. Twila's answers place blame on other jurors, and involve too many unnecessary apologies. Chris convinces Leann by telling his story of perseverance, 3-0. Ami is next, and Chris's answers here are flawless. Complimenting Ami, while not down talking anyone. If Ami's vote was at all based on her question or FTC then Chris gets it. She later stated that Twila played her and therefore deserved her vote, 3-1. Chad tosses up an easy question to each asking, ""What is something that changed you?"" Twila focuses on a negative while Chris hits a homerun with his answer by complimenting the jury with sincerity and respect, 4-1. Game, set, match. From there Sarge rips into Twila for lying on her son's name and then tries to use reverse psch on Chris, saying he won't get his vote, but asking if they are still friends. Chris still delivers a flawless answer. Scout is obviously for Twila, but totally calls Chris on all of his bullshit. Twila closes with a defensive statement. Fighting back after being attacked all FTC she ends with another apology. Chris closes with a personal statement to each jury member, and completes one of the best FTC performances of all time.

**Funniest/Craziest Moments**

- On the hike to camp after the opening ceremony, Scout and Dolly want to stop in the dark and rest overnight. For the men, Rory gets a little bossy.

- Chad reveals he is an amputee.

- The men lose the first immunity challenge because Chris can't get across the balance beam. ""In this game you outwit, outplay, outlast people. You don't out balance them.""

- Rory gets upset back at camp because the women were celebrating and dancing after winning a reward challenge. 

- Twila tries to stab a wild chicken, but it gets loose and flies away. They get 5 eggs though.

- Rory, while blindfolded, is just yelling nonsense at the blindfold challenge. Sarge, the caller, yells at him to stop.

- The afternoon before the first women's tribal is so hectic. Eliza, Twila, Leann all on the block. All turns back on Dolly, who thinks she is the swing vote.

- Sarge is upset that Rory takes a lot of walks and breaks.

- Twila and Mia get in a fight over camp work ethic.

- John wins immunity and gets to assign immunity to a Yasur women. He immediately divides them by how they voted at the first tribal.

- At the second Yasur tribal, Lisa flips against Eliza and the young girls, basically screwing Eliza the same way Eliza screwed her at the previous vote. 

- Winner of reward gets 24 hours with a native of Vanuatu. Now that's a reward!

- Rory is the caller during a puzzle challenge. He loses control and everyone ignores him.

- The men argue about sleeping locations around the fire. Bubba always takes the best spot and refuses to give it up.

- EARTHQUAKE!

- Tribe's are each told to select a chief. The chief's become captains. One captain divides the tribes, the other captain selects which team they want. Scout divides, Sarge take the male dominant Lopevi tribe.

- Ami doesn't want to show the guys their cool camp tricks because she is so pro-women alliance.

- At the first immunity challenge after the tribe swap while waiting on the tribal mats, Bubba says over to Chris, ""Think about the merge"". Not so subtle, and Ami hears him, which leads to him going home that tribal.

- Rory plays up his anger after Bubba is voted out. Culminating in a cheesy speech the next day. Actually a great strategy, and between this and his challenge performances, the women of Yasur vote out Lisa over him.

- Eliza doesn't catch a single pig at a challenge and people were pissed. At a later immunity challenge when pig-catching is used again, she fails to catch a pig, eliminating her from that challenge. 

- Julie's weird flirty relationship with Sarge. She sunbathes naked next to him, and gets him to sunbathe his naked butt with her. Later she snuggles between his legs around the fire. Sarge was loving every minute of it, and I guess she thought it was helping her go farther. 

- Lisa says to Ami, ""Where is the maniok tree, just in case you aren't her."" which leads to Ami not trusting Lisa and Lisa being voted off.

- Scout and Ami make Lisa swear her loyalty to them on an invisible bible. 

- Rory breaks the tribal immunity idol as he slams it into the ground.

- The women paint each other's bodies. Julie goes to tribal with a heart tattoo that reads ""Jeff"". Probst and Julie go on to date for a few years after the show.

- Rory is the first to go after the merge, initiating the gender war.

- The pecking order challenge gets fierce with 9 left. 3 guys out first, followed by Eliza. Eliza is pissed about it as she realizes where she stands. Leann wins and takes Julie on reward. This leads Eliza to later flip on the women.

- Leann and Julie bring back chicken wings from reward. They give them to the girls who run and eat them in the woods while the three men are on the boat. Then they tell the guys they could only bring back the chicken bones. The men love it and are grateful for the little meat. Well played.

- Julie puts doubt in Twila's head by saying the guys promised her the same deal.

- Chris tells everyone that Sarge told him to vote for him. 

- Scout becomes unhappy that Leann and Ami have put Julie ahead of her and Twila. Decides she is going to flip with the guys when she can. 

- Chris, Chad, Eliza, Ami drink a bowl of kava on reward. Chad gets wasted off of the kava and can't stand/walk.

- Chris gives one of the all time great confessionals, ""You question a women's character, you question a women's ability, she'll snap your neck! You open up your heart, show a women you're vulnerable, then they start thinking with their heart. That's when they open up that back door. That's what's happened this time.""

- Chris stirs things up after Chad is voted out. Reveals Scouts/Twila's plans of betrayal to Eliza and Leann.

- Twila swears to Ami and Leann on her son's name that she is with them 100%. Leann goes home and the promise haunts Twila the rest of the game.

- Loved ones participate in immunity. Chris seemingly going home if he loses. He does lose and his wife starts crying, which gets the women to start opening up. Him, Eliza, Twila, and Scout team up and take over majority. 

- Ami has it out with Twila/Scout back at camp after Leann goes home instead of Chris.

- Twila gets sick of people bringing up the promise she made. Goes off on her alliance member, Eliza.

- Chris loses reward by not seeing/using one of his puzzle pieces.

- Twila buried bananas in the ground to ripen and won't tell people where they are. Threatens to let them rot.

- Twila over hears Chris and Eliza talking final two. Causes a fight between Twila and Eliza.

- Twila says at tribal that Eliza doesn't deserve to be in final 5.

- Chris's confessionals are the only true glimpses of how he feels. All live footage and conversations is him lying and being fake to people.

- The stare from Eliza at Chris as she is voted out is priceless. His reaction of 'yea, whatever' is just as good.

Nobody ever talks about him as a great winner but he may have had the best social game for a first time player ever.  Pre-merge he took charge by creating a majority alliance by unifying the ""fat guys"".  This ensured that his lack of physical skill would not cost him pre-merge.  
Once the merge took place he flew under the radar and waited until there was a crack in the women alliance.  He constantly planted seeds by going up to one group of girls and saying the other group was trying to rope him in as a swing vote.  He played himself as a swing vote and was constantly playing both sides without offending anyone.  Even though his voting pattern was always inline with Scout and Twila, he had legitimate friendships with those being voted out (Julie, Eliza, and even Amy to an extent).
Although Twila received two votes at the FTC, the outcome was never in any real doubt.  Chris went from being the only guy left on a seven-person tribe to sitting at the FTC next to the most annoying player.  His underdog story was capped off by the fact that he won three out of the last four immunity challenges.  
Mad respect for Chris.  You would be hard pressed to find another winner who played a social game post-merge as well as Chris.  Keep in mind, he did all of this without a HII or the benefit of redemption island or any other modern twist that CBS has thrown in.

It isn't going to be a ""favorites vs. family"" arrangement.  I *think* I'm in the minority in this prediction, but a few reasons why I feel this will be the case:

* We just did a ""favorites vs."" season.  I can't see doing 2 of them back-to-back.

* The logo shows one couple holding hands, and another couple just standing next to one another, which leads to another point

* The name of ""blood vs. water"", leads to the same point as the previous bullet.  That point being....

* The ""blood"" tribe will be family members related by blood (brother / sister, cousins, etc).  Those are the pairs represented by the logo-couple not holding hands (unless you're Kat, you don't hold hands with your brother or cousin).  The ""water"" tribe will be family members *not* related by blood (married couples, in-laws, perhaps even ""bffs"").  The married couple is the one holding hands in the logo.

* But most importantly, **having pairs on the same tribe is the only way the format makes any sense**.  And that's the main point I want to hit on in this post.

If you have family vs. favorites, the post-merge game is going to be predictable, boring and disastrous.  Basically, whichever couples happen to make it to the merge are going to team up and take out all the single players who make it to the merge.  It is the simplest and most obvious strategy.

And that's because it is so much easier to execute.  To form a 6-person alliance, you don't need to find 5 other people.  You only need to find 2 other couples and, bam!, there's your 6 person alliance.

But now let's look at having family members on the same tribe:

Pairs have always been dangerous in Survivor and every student of the game knows that forming a close and obvious bond with another player puts one, or both, of you in danger.  So that means that the logical strategy in this format will be to target couples.  Once your family member is gone, you instantly become less of a threat (and dramatically so) because you now only have one vote... while everyone else essentially has 2.

And this is the part that is starting to make **this concept really interesting to me**:  When you target a couple consisting of one returning player and one newbie, which one are you going to vote out?  Are you voting out Rob C, or his wife?  There may be exceptions for individuals, but your real objective is to break up the couple.  And if you're doing that anyway, you may as well vote out the expert.  **So, IMO, this format really puts the returning players at a disadvantage**; which I think is a good thing.

You could still have couples getting to the merge and taking control, but I think it is less likely with this format.  I'm working on the assumption that *both* tribes would do the logical approach and try to vote out 1/2 of a pair before voting out an entire pair.  And if they both do that, and we don't end up with terribly imbalanced tribal immunities, there shouldn't be enough couples left to take control.  (And if it is an imbalaced tribal immunity, then it is no different than regular 'ol Pagonging that we can get any season).

1368115113.0,16,self.survivor,1e09tx,"Every possible final three, with predictions (spoilers)",18,2,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/survivor/comments/1e09tx/every_possible_final_three_with_predictions/,"I was talking to my wife yesterday after the episode.  We were making predictions.  While you can’t really predict who will win the next two immunity challenges, especially without know what the challenges are, you **can** look at every final 3 scenario.

I’ve attempted to do this.  I also tried to guess what place a cast member comes in if they do not win.  I do not believe there are any discrepancies, but it is possible.  I used information from the show, exit interviews, tweets from the cast and Ponderosa videos to gauge votes.

For a while, I’ve been saying Sherri is a lock at 3rd.  Cochran would beat everyone.  As I was listing it out, it reinforced those opinions.  It also highlighted how much of a dark horse Erik is.  Again, these are opinions.  If alliances hold true and there is no interference from Erik or Eddie by way of winning immunity, I agree with the popular opinion: we’ll see Cochran, Dawn and Sherri.

**Cochran**

The current jury likes Cochran.  They respect his play and his physical performance.  Additionally, he has held true to his 3 person alliance and hasn’t made unnecessary moves.  In Ponderosa, Mike has explained his favor of Cochran.  Andrea and Malcolm seem to like the guy, too.  If he makes it to the end, I think he wins.

* Dawn &amp; Sherri - WIN
* Dawn &amp; Erik - WIN
* Dawn &amp; Eddie - WIN
* Sherri &amp; Erik - WIN
* Sherri &amp; Eddie – WIN 
* Erik &amp; Eddie - WIN

**Dawn**

After Brenda, Dawn is in trouble.  Phillip and Reynold have really been hard on her on Twitter and in Ponderosa.  She’ll basically have to put the jury’s back against the wall and take the two weakest players – Sherri and Eddie – but even then Eddie could swing some 3-amigo-mojo.  She HAS to keep Cochran or lose even more face, but she can’t beat him.  She’s stuck and now seems to be a lying two faced person.

* Cochran &amp; Sherri – LOSS, 2ND
* Cochran &amp; Erik – LOSS, 3RD
* Cochran &amp; Eddie – LOSS, 3RD
* Sherri &amp; Erik – LOSS, 2ND
* Sherri &amp; Eddie – WIN
* Erik &amp; Eddie – LOSS, 2ND

**Sherri**

Sherri has been a lock at 3rd ever since she flipped to the favorites.  Her ex-fan tribe won’t vote for her.  The favorites view her as a pawn.  She’s the only person I comfortably guess is a lock for the final three.

* Cochran &amp; Dawn – LOSS, 3RD
* Cochran &amp; Erik – LOSS, 3RD
* Cochran &amp; Eddie – LOSS, 3RD
* Dawn &amp; Erik – LOSS, 3RD
* Dawn &amp; Eddie – LOSS, 3RD
* Erik &amp; Eddie – LOSS, 3RD


**Erik**

Erik is a darkhorse.  He’s been described as harmless and non-strategic in exit interviews.  Andrea even said he told her “the best strategy is no strategy.”  But I believe he is doing one of the best flying under the radars ever.  I don’t think he’s even trying to win all the challenges.  I don’t think he can beat Cochran, and now that everyone thinks Dawn is a hypocrite, he’s 2nd.  Any scenario in which he gets to the end, without Cochran, he wins.

* Cochran &amp; Dawn – LOSS, 2ND
* Cochran &amp; Sherri – LOSS, 2ND
* Cochran &amp; Eddie – LOSS, 2ND
* Dawn &amp; Sherri - WIN
* Dawn &amp; Eddie - WIN
* Sherri &amp; Eddie - WIN

**Eddie**

Eddie has consistently proved he has no idea what is going on.  He can basically beat Sherri, on likeability alone, but I don’t think the jury believes he should win.  He COULD land Malcolm and Reynold (if they vote friendship) and even Andrea could jump in.  He’d still need more votes though – and I don’t think anyone else on the jury would give him $1 million for falling into the final 3.

* Cochran &amp; Dawn – LOSS, 2ND
* Cochran &amp; Sherri – LOSS, 2ND
* Cochran &amp; Erik – LOSS, 3RD
* Dawn &amp; Sherri – LOSS, 2ND
* Dawn &amp; Erik – LOSS, 3RD
* Sherri &amp; Erik – LOSS, 2ND



**TL;DR** – These are only opinions.  Cochran, Dawn or Erik will win.  Sherri and Eddie have no shot.  No one can beat Cochran.  Dawn can only beat Sherri and Eddie.  Erik is surprisingly in good shape if he can get Cochran out.

Let me know what I missed or if you disagree with anything.


**Before the show starts**

Get in the best shape you can before going on the show.


Learn how to hold your breath for a long time.  It’s not that hard to learn and might give you an advantage in a challenge.


Practice swimming.


Practice doing puzzles.


Learn about knots and practice untying knots.  This is common in challenges and you could have an edge if you practiced.


**Gameplay**

In the beginning of the game, to avoid being the first voted out, try to be personable and agreeable.  Don’t argue over work/shelter etc.  Don’t be dominating.  Hang out with large groups so you’re there for strategy conversations.  


Be ready to adapt your strategy to the current situation.


Don’t trust someone because they swear on their family.  They’re no less likely to go back on their promise, and if they’re swearing on their family, it’s only because they really, really need you to believe them.


If you find a hidden immunity idol, don’t tell anyone.  Once one person knows, news will spread fast.  Telling someone can only hurt you.


It’s better to use a hidden immunity idol when you don’t need it, than to need it when you don’t use it.


Personal attacks are a great way to lose jury votes and embarrass yourself on TV.


Assume that people will lie to you and break promises if they think it’s in their best interest.  Be ready to do the same.  Don’t tell someone something just because they ask nicely.


Never offer more information than necessary.  It could be used against you later.  Knowledge is power.


Be careful how you answer Jeff’s questions at Tribal Council.  He tries to dig up dirt and get you to say something that will cause drama and conflict (making the show ‘better’, but potentially screwing up your game).


Try to get people to think you don’t have friends on the jury.  They might be more likely to take you to the finals.


Lose gracefully.  Don't go out like a sore loser and don't be a bitter juror.  More great ways to embarrass yourself on TV.",,False,self,t5_2qhu3,False,,,True,t3_1091ff,http://www.reddit.com/r/survivor/comments/1091ff/some_thoughts_on_strategy_and_gameplay/,

I would lose my shit if I was Troyzan.The only players with any brains are Kim and Troyzan, and really Troyzan is a idiot too. The second he and Jay were lied to that should have no longer been a question it was back to women on men. The only reason he doesn't get the kind idiot hat is because he didn't trust them implicitly, unlike Jay who trusted right up until he left.

I started out disgusted with the women and their weak early game, and I find myself disgusted with the men's idiocy and the women's bitchiness. I mean congratulations you lied to someone in survivor and these idiots believed you, it's not like they pulled off some masterful strategy, they are just lucky no one there is willing to do anything with out being told first.

OH AND CHRISTINA, MY GOD

She is the dumbest person to ever play survivor ever, I used to feel bad for her but she doesn't deserve to be there at all. I mean she is nice, but she cannot play that game. Sabrina (like and idiot) tells her that two votes are coming her way, which means if Troy gets had an idol she would be the one to get the boot, and she doesn't make that connection (or at least they didn't show it) and then her plan is to go tell Troy about his one chance to get Christina off.

While I can't say that I've loved every new gameplay twist that they've come up with, I appreciate that the creators of the show try new ideas.  I actually like [Redemption Island](http://www.reddit.com/r/survivor/comments/mg3k5/cbs_renews_survivor_for_two_more_seasons/c30q07m) but I think it's gone for good.

But with this whole ""both tribes live together"" concept, I think that really opens up for more strategic developments.  One of the most boring and predictable aspects of survivor is that after the merge, the larger tribe almost always takes out the members of the losing tribe immediately.  It drives me crazy, I always feel like skipping ahead 4-5 episodes just so I can see some scrambling and deception.

I'm thinking that the next episode might allow for more secret alliances to form so that we might not see this same post-merge dynamic.  That's what I'm hoping at least.

I have two:

**Todd Herzog.** On episode one of China, his mind was flying, abuzz with strategy right off the start. I remember thinking that if he didn't get knocked out early, he had more than enough social/strategic ability win.

**Denise Stapley.** Immediately, it was apparent that she was intellectually and socially gifted. Then they got to the first challenge and she showed that, despite her littler frame, she packed a powerful punch. From the first episode on, I considered her the biggest threat to win.

And from the sounds of the audience at the reunion, the majority of Survivor fans at the time thought the exact same thing. The fact that supposed ""All Stars"" like Lex and Alicia felt the need to drag Rob and Amber through the mud just because they got beat is pathetic and shameful (Kathy was a little over the top also, but I'm giving her a pass because she actually voted for Rob).

I know this isn't a revelation, but I just had to get it out. These people are supposed to be the best of the best, and yet they somehow believe that Rob crossed some sort of line by voting them out? Are they being serious? Then for Lex and Kathy to even try this bullshit about ""oh Rob, we kept Amber 100% as a favor to you, and this is how you repay us?"" Like they wouldn't have done it if they didn't think it was a good strategic move for them? It's pathetic that they are unable to admit their own boneheaded mistake, and instead spit vitriol and bitterness at Rob for playing the game they're all supposed to be All Stars at. 

My favorite line at FTC is Alicia (btw, Alicia? All Star? Um.... okay) saying, ""you may have outwitted us, outplayed us, and outlasted us, but you DID NOT outclass us."" That one had me dying. Yeah Alicia, you guys are really the definition of class over there. Shii Ann hit the nail on the head with her ""people in glass houses shouldn't throw stones"" comment, and I just wish she would have gone further.

As an aside, anyone know if these people still basically hate each other? The reunion show was one of the most awkward hours I've ever witnessed (America's Tribal Council was pretty painful also).

On the island it seemed like there were people there to be ""contestants"", but then there were people (most of them!) that were there to be ""cast-members""; I would even say that most imagined Survivor to be an island version of The Real World.

The Challenges were what really threw me off. They were the cheapest, dumbest, most anti-climactic challenges I've ever seen on the show. One of them was literally a contest to see who can hold their breath the longest underwater. They have really come a long way.

It was really clear after watching that the castaways had no idea the show would be as popular as it was and didn't think about their gameplay at all. BB said that the first few days were huge regrets for him because he didn't have any idea how to play and only worried about working.

I have been wondering about this after this episode and I can't think of any instance where this has happened in the past. 

S11 Guatemala - had only one idol in play.

S12 Exile Island - same

S13 Cook Islands - same (Would have been awesome if Candice could have found one)

S14 Fiji - Didn't really watch this season properly but I think only Yau-Man had one?

S15 China - 2 idols carried from pre-merge, both with James and none were replaced after James was voted out with the two idols.

S16 Micronesia - Only one idol in play at all times in the game.

S17 Gabon - same.

S18 Tocantins - 2 idols carried into merge, but a second one wasn't planted when Brendan was voted out with his idol.

S19 Samoa - When Erik was voted out post-merge with his idol, Russell had the other HII. Wasn't replanted until Russell played his idol(s)

S20 HvV - 2 idols carried into merge, and only one planted after Parvati played both idols.

S21 Nicaragua - the 2 pre-merge idols were carried to the end.

S22 Redemption Island - After Zapatera played their idol, a new one wasn't introduced.

S23 South Pacific - After Savaii played their idol, a new one wasn't introduced.

S24 One World - Colton left pre-merge with his idol, a new one wasn't introduced post-merge

S25 Phillipines - 3 idols heading into merge, a new idol (s) was never planted even after Penner and Abi played their idols.


Which brings me to Survivor Caramoan. Why go against the past rules now? In my mind there's no doubt that the producers introduced a second idol to give Malcolm a chance as he is a production favorite.  I can't imagine the same thing happening say someone like Brenda, Andrea or one of the other less popular guys were in his position.  Obviously there's no hard and fast rule that a second immunity idol cannot be planted when one is already in play and the producers could always say they did hide a second idol before but the players never found it.
