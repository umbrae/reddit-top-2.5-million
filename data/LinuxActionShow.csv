1346556397.0,96,self.LinuxActionShow,z7rdu,Why Miguel de Icaza is Wrong About Desktop Linux,136,40,91,http://www.reddit.com/r/LinuxActionShow/comments/z7rdu/why_miguel_de_icaza_is_wrong_about_desktop_linux/,"Someone of note proclaiming Linux on the desktop is dead is nothing new. The last really big stir up I recall was in early November of 2011, and it hurt. The numbers were ran, the math was in, and there was just no avoiding it, **Android** had killed Linux! 

That first Sunday of November we decided [to tackle the elephant in the room on the Linux Action Show](http://www.jupiterbroadcasting.com/13503/is-desktop-linux-dead/). 
If I do say so my self, we did such a fine job settling the whole matter I assumed the world would move on. 

But this most recent round of ""Linux is dead"" stings a bit more, not only is it from one of our own, [Miguel de Icaza](http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2012/Aug-29.html), but he makes some [damn good points](http://www.reddit.com/r/LinuxActionShow/comments/z1ba7/gnome_founder_miguel_de_icaza_says_desktop_linux/c611hyn).

I think backwards compatibility is hugely important, and it's one of the issues thats driven me to use OS X on my video production systems, along with the media tools. 

I also use a FreeBSD file server, that doesn't mean Linux on the server is dead. I  recognize I am using these Mac's and my file server as a production tool, not applicable to average computer users.


I think from the big picture perspective, much like his continued efforts with Mono, Miguel misses the mark. While I think one could argue he's right about desktop Linux as most us enthusiast think of it, the market has decided that's no longer the debate. 


It's now: *Can Ubuntu be successful?*


###First dimension: Compatibility.

This is where I think Miguel's got the most traction, it's a historically weak area for Linux. But it's quickly becoming less of a problem. 

""Cloud"" apps remove the issue of client compatibly breakage, Google's very successful internal use of Goobuntu proves this, and is an indicator of future business application.

Native client apps can be distributed through Ubuntu's Software Center, and they can target LTS releases of Ubuntu for guaranteed compatibility.  It's happening today, and at a faster pace then I've ever seen. This is as much as can be expected on Mac OS X. And with Microsoft's transition to Metro, it's hard to say how developers should plan for that platform.

###Switchers.

Miguel, citing him self as an example, suggests Linux is suffering from a brain drain. 


&gt;Many hackers moved to OSX. It was a good looking Unix, with working audio, PDF viewers, working video drivers, codecs for watching movies and at the end of the day, a very pleasant system to use. Many exchanged absolute configurability of their system for a stable system.

&gt;As for myself, I had fallen in love with the iPhone, so using a Mac on a day-to-day basis was a must.


He fails to notice that innovation in OS X has begun to slow, and age. It's HFS+ file system is disastrously out of date, and OS X remains tied to hardware that's priced beyond what a large market will pay. The introductions of technologies like artificially constructed overly restrictive application sandboxing show an intent to dumb down the desktop.

Apple's continued focus on iOS does not paint a great long term picture.  *OS X has had a roadmap since day one, and it's nearing the end:*


&gt;Steve Jobs launched the initial 10.0 version of Mac OS X in March 2001, describing it as a platform Apple would use **over the next fifteen years, or roughly the same period of time the ""classic Mac OS"" had been used** to power the Macintosh at the time. When he said that, Jobs also likely had in mind that NeXT, which built the operating system that Mac OS X was built on, was itself 15 years old in 2001 (having existed since his departure from Apple in 1986). [SOURCE](http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/12/01/03/the_next_ten_years_of_mac_os_x.html)


These same elite theoretical hackers will jump ship once again, just as they have many times before. 

The future of Linux on the desktop, in the context of something that's targeted by commercial parties and has years of stability expected, already has become Ubuntu LTS. 

For Miguel to miss this obvious fact, show's that he's been using the Mac for too long, and his lack of insight betrays he is probably not qualified to make such grand statements anymore.   

The traditional vendor desktops are transitioning.  Apple keeps telling us it's dead and Microsoft is trying to kill it with Windows 8. Last time I checked, Linux has one of the more viable long-term outlooks for users who want a traditional, yet modernized and feature rich desktop UI.

The community of enthusiasts new and old talk about the Linux desktop market as we see it, a completive landscape with interesting approaches and solutions to problems we have. And that's true, for us. But it certainly would be a nightmare for a slow moving corporation who wants the biggest return on onetime investments. 

But that's a problem that's been obvious for years, and one that Mark Shuttleworth aims to solve.

The industry has already identified Ubuntu as a clear leader. Using just this week's news docket as a reference, it's obvious Ubuntu support comes first, and [Canonical is making every effort to encourage that](http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=MTE2NTc). Every big Kickstarter, new games, video editors, and more all ship with Ubuntu support first.

Ubuntu Linux sits in the sweet zone for the ecosystem Miguel says Linux squandered.

+ Easy to use
+ Well supported
+ Commercially backed (companies like Valve like this)
+ Significant and growing market share.
+ Proven LTS release cycle.
+ Commercially dedicated focus on the desktop product (i.e., failure of Fedora or openSUSE does not put anyone out of business).


I wanted to write my thoughts down, this is just one of the topics we're covering on this week's episode of [The Linux Action Show](http://www.jupiterbroadcasting.com/23996/trisquel-gnulinux-review-las-s23e05/). Be sure to catch episode 5 of season 23!

Words were said, folks are frazzled. I'm ready to offer something fun that all of us will enjoy.


Matt goes monkey:
Here's the deal. If one year from now, Mir isn't being used not only by Ubuntu, but also by at LEAST one additional distro NOT based on Ubuntu (Arch, OpenSuSE, etc), I will (with Chris' permission) wear the following ON THE SHOW for an entire segment recapping Mir vs Wayland progress.

http://imgur.com/nsVSJPg

To be clear, this means Ubuntu and one other NON-Ubuntu distro are actively making Mir their default display server.

I'm completely serious. Either way, the community wins.


Feel free to file this one under ""Matt puts up or shuts up"" on March 16th, 2014.  :)


**Edit:** I've added this to my web calendar -- this bet is live in 2014, March as I've confirmed all of this with Chris. 

....and I screwed up by using Arch as an example. Apparently, no default display server! Gulp! Also adjusted to correct date for 2014, March 16th.

Sometimes ago, I had installed Elementary OS beta 2. I was little skeptical, just like most Linux users about how good could it be (and I had thought it looked more Mac like). 


After installation, I was really impressed. It was my first Linux distribution, that required the least amount of configuration (even less than Mint). Moreover, I haven't seen any distribution that has mastered the login process as Elementary OS does (booting, transition and login).


Since it was built using ubuntu 12.04.2 (with backporting drivers), it ran cooler right out of the box. When I unplugged the power cords it was showing as good battery life as I would get only after installing laptop-mode-tools on other distributions. When you start to use the desktop (with little adjustment for lack of minimize button), you really start to admire the asthetics (even for person like me, who is comfortable without any GUI for days, when something breaks). Its minimilistic approach and ease of use is simply amazing. There must be a reason why people even outside core Linux circle like this distribution.


Only reason I had to abandon Elementary was its incompatibility with catalyst driver (later I had noticed the downloaded version from AMD's site was broken even on ubuntu). I could have solved that problem, but my interest had shifted to something else.


Anyways, I really love the distribution. It is definitely a distribution new users and experienced users alike should try at least once and see for themselves, what I mean. I would like to hear your views, and would love if LAS did a review.",,False,self,t5_2sp2j,1376236512.0,,,True,t3_1k550r,http://www.reddit.com/r/LinuxActionShow/comments/1k550r/how_about_elementary_os_review_on_las/,

Just like the stuff you see Bear Grylls do on Discovery Channel it isn't something you will need daily, but in case you ever find yourself lost in the jungle you'll be glad to know where to find the tastiest maggots. 

* **Surviving the forums**  

This one is quite easy. Many like to believe that Arch Users feel elitist and will give new users a hard time if they call for help.
Simply remember 3 things when asking for help on an issue:

* Tell them what your problem is and what outcome you did expect
* Tell them what you have done before this problem occured and what you have installed and configured
* Tell them what you have tried fix the problem but with no success

If you put effort into your post, you will find out that the forum is a great place to get help and the first answer usually fixes your problem.  It is rare that someone will come and ask you to do this totally unrelated thing instead, like I have experienced on Ubuntu forums often. Show them that don't expect them to read your mind, give all the information you have. Arch Users hate picking peoples nose to slowly get the relevant information. They will also see if you put 10 seconds into your post and expect them to spend 5 minutes giving you the solution on a silver plate. Many will find your behavior to be rude and ignore you or start trolling.  

  
* **How to avoid breaking your system in the first place**

Arch gives you a lot of freedom to tinker and experiment. This has lead me to constantly try new stuff on my system when I started using Arch. If you treat your system like a sandbox because you always wanted to try out this new experimental thing ,don't be surprised if something breaks. Of all the times I messed up my system in the beginning it was because I did not fully understand what I was doing. It was not the fault of broken packages it was me doing stuff wrong this might be hard to admit to yourself. If you don't know what a command does don't paste it into the terminal and hit [Enter]. If you want to tinker and try something experimental use a LVM snapshot so you can rollback or set up a VirtualMachine. Having a stable snapshot that you can boot into is helpful in general.

* **Using pacman**
  
  
It is not necessary to always look at the news section every day so you can do ""pacman -Syu"". If pacman spits out an error like ""file exists in filesystem"" and aborts the update process (without overwritting files) it's time to go to archlinux.org, because it might be a major change that requires manual intervetion. The news announcement will tell you how to resolve it safely. This happen 3-4 times in the last 2 years. DO NOT SIMPLY USE -f (--force) UNLESS THE NEWS SAYS SO. You're basically asking to be screwed over in that case. It is a good idea to subscribe to arch-dev-public mailing list so you know about changes that will happen in the future and might require manual intervention.
There are several users contributions which help you with your ""pacman discipline"". Search for ""pacnanny"" or ""pacmatic"" on the Arch Linux forums. Also ask yourself if you really need to update when you have important work to be done.

Be very very careful when removing packages with with pacman -Rsc , -Rs or other parameters such as -Rdd. When cleaning up dependencies that have been installed by another program double check what you are actually removing. If you want to know why something was installed look at ""pacman -Qii &lt;package&gt;.  
Never install packages with ""pacman -Sy &lt;package&gt;"". Read here if you want to know why: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Pacman#Partial_upgrades_are_unsupported

Read the output of pacman carefully. If some files are saved as *.pacsave or *.pacnew they have to be merged with ""sudo pacdiff"". Imagine having a customized pacman.conf, now pacman moves to a new version and all the files are updated. It won't simply overwrite your pacman.conf with the new one but save the new file as *.pacsave. So make sure to merge those files, otherwise you'll be using new pacman with old and maybe incompatible configuration file. Sometimes you will also see post installation messages in your terminal. For example if you install ""chromium-pepper-flash"" you'll be told to deactivate other flash plugins in chrome://plugins or otherwise you'll run into trouble. If you think you missed these messages download the package as tarball and look at the *.install file which handles the installation routine.

* **Using the AUR**
  
Always remember that the AUR contains unsupported/unofficial packages. If you replace core system components with AUR packages don't be surprised if things are more likely to break. Everyone can submit packages it doesn't hurt to look at the PKGBUILD before installing something. If you register an account on the AUR, you can click ""Notify of new comments"" to stay up to date and see if other people are having trouble with a certain package.
  
* **Learn how to downgrade packages**


pacman keeps downloaded packges in /var/cache/pacman/pkg. If you have problems with the newst kernel for example the previous package might still be there unless you did a ""pacman -Scc"" to free up some space. In that case you can pacman -U &lt;packagefile&gt;. You can have your pacman cache on a network share and mount it on other PCs if you want to be cool and want to grow a good cache for downgrade. If you don't have the package you can look at the ARM (Arch Rollback Machine) which stores old packages. There are also many downgrade helpers in case you have to downgrade dependencies aswell. 

* **How to handle the worst-case**

So your PC doesn't start? 1. Take a deep breath 2. Try to remember what you just installed to the system. 3. Pop in your Arch Live USB stick. 4. Mount root partition and arch-chroot /mnt. 5. Look at /var/log/pacman.log to see what you installed recently. 6. Often ""mkinitcpio -p linux"" to rebuild initramfs or a full update ""pacman -Syu"" helps. 7. If still not successful gather information and search the Arch Linux forum if this is a known problem. If not start a new thread in the right forum.

Things have never been better for LAS and Jupiter Broadcasting.  Our hosts are all top notch, and really making every show a really strong performer on its own, and also as part of a whole.

We've never been getting more email into the show, and it's really been encouraging to see so many postive and supportive comments about the transitions the show has taken this year, and how many of you really are enjoying the topics we've focused on.

All of you who have contributed to this subreddit over the year have made the show possible every single week.  You guys help us scale, we could not do a show this big without our amazing community here, and outside the subreddit.

Matt and I have a ton of ideas for 2013, and things have really never looked better for Linux. So I'm excited for where I think 2013 is going to take us.

In a few ways I still feel like the show is just getting started. And your help in this subreddit keeps hundreds of ideas flowing into the show.

There have been many apps that you have picked that I had never heard of save the LAS picks.

First of all, great show. And if you want to use this message and/or parts of it in one of your shows, have at it.

As i, out of curiosity, lurked around in the windows subreddit, i came across a post, that claimed that the poster was switching back to Windows after using Ubuntu for a while, because ""Linux always needs better hardware all the time, and he didn't like to buy new stuff all the time.""

Really? Strangely enough, i had the exact opposite experience and part of it is how i came to learn to use computers and how that slowly brought me to linux in the long run. It'll be a bit of a read, though, so bear with me.

I'm a kid of the 80's, born in '75 i became aware of computers and games around '87-ish. It started with a Commodore C16, which i still have, on which i took my first steps in BASIC. It continued with a Commodore Plus 4 (basically a C16 with more RAM) which was a hand-me-down from my father, who to this day always dabbled in new technology and is still getting his feet wet. I finally got my own Amiga 500 around the 90s, and a friend of mine and me, started to program games on it. We blatantly stole images from other games on that machine by hacking into the code and extracting them since no one we knew could draw. (I apologize to Gods and ""It came from the Desert"" on that regard. But, damn that nurse was hot then …).

So far all machines i encountered where more or less blank slates that you could easily bend to your will and do what you want with them by hacking around and having fun. Parallel to that my father got a real PC. And with it DOS. Now back then, getting games to work there, was more like being a mechanic than everything else. You had to set your machine's different memories up differently for nearly every game. So i did just that, and learned how to tweak the maximum out of the limitation of the machines. That really coined my approach to handling computers, in hindsight.

All the while on my high-school (i'm from Germany, so for those in the know of our school system, i was on a Gymnasium, basically a high-school focusing it's education to provide for a better academic career), we had computer classes and they used unix as a base system. It was the first time i came into contact with that. It was simple, it had no graphical UI. But i learned the first commands there (like ls :P ). And since we were doing our work in PASCAL, i learned what a compiler is from there as well.

Parallel to that Windows 95 had popped up. And since then i always considered a GUI nothing more than a nicer way to interact with the same system. Some things were easier in the GUI, for some i had to open the command line and get my elbows dirty again. No biggie, i was used to it and i liked it that way.

Around that time, i got to the university and studied computer science. And there i had my second encounter with Unix. Since i had learned the basics in school, i was able to find my way around pretty quickly, and happily found out about man-pages absorbing a great lot of them. I also noticed, that unix had window managers. And so i was often to be found in one of the computer rooms, dabbling around in the depth of night tweaking my fvwm configurations, and getting my hand on every stupid thing i could find. (*cough*XEyes*cough*). It was new, it was kinda-shiny for me. And boy was it **configurable**. In my eyes, it was way superior to the kind of UI Windows was providing. I grew very fond of virtual desktops at that time as well.

Later, i had to stick with Windows. On one side that was work related. My employers used it, so i used it at home too. Also, games.

That kept on going for some years until about 2010. A year earlier someone gifted me a laptop. Not a powerful machine, but she had won it, and didn't needed it. So i took it in. It was a 1,8GHz Sempron single core with 512 Megs of RAM. And an 80 Gig HDD. Cute, compared to todays standards. Nonetheless, that one was to become the ""roleplaying gm helper station"", dedicated to hoisting around the ton's of PDFs and self-written roleplaying supplements. So instead of having to move tons of books, i only needed that one computer. Perfect.

Not so perfect was that that machine came with Vista Home Basic pre-installed. Yes. Vista. You did read the specs up there, did you?. The first boot of that machine took 20 Minutes as Vista was doing it's checks and gave it a terrible rating. That annoyed me so much, that i went out to get all necessary drivers for Windows XP and threw together a custom XP version via nlite having all the drivers on it and all the partitions and users already set up. That one ran pretty well.

Still. The age of the OS was showing. And some things were cumbersome to use under Windows. Especially Adobe Products (i'm looking at you READER!) started to take their toll on the old processor.

I had started to watch LAS around that time. And as Ubuntu 10.04 came around, i was ready to try it on that machine. Since it wasn't critical in my environment at that time, i just started the machine over. It was a blessing. So after testing some configurations in VirtualBox at that time i went for a nice full encrypted setup (well, except for the boot partition, but it was for data-protection in case of theft or loss, so it was sufficient).

I was shocked. Out of the box, everything on that machine worked instantly. WLAN, LAN, display, the keyboard, nothing needed extra drivers. Ubuntu even noticed that the Laptop had a FAX-modem installed and asked if i wanted the proprietary drivers. I was perplexed. And happy. And, i could finally do something i forgot how much i missed it: I could get my elbows dirty again. Vista and later Windows versions gradually took more and more control from the user, and that annoyed me. I wanted to tweak, get dirty. Microsoft didn't seem to want that anymore. So, i got annoyed. Ubuntu OTOH didn't. I started to read about the architecture again, and learned how things are done the Debian Way (and in several cases, how Ubuntu did things differently). But the best thing: I had my virtual desktops back. I really liked Gnome 2 back then.

I started to write little roleplay helpers for the machine, and i could set her up in a very efficient way to do what she was supposed to do: Support the GM. I also learned about the power of bash-scripting and that i could find a nice little tool for nearly every specific task in the repos which i could assemble in any way i needed via a simple script. Once again i was in that happy place of mine. Being able to do some things comfortably with the GUI, but being also able to get my hands really dirty with the terminal. 

LAS had a great part in that, as i was pointed in different directions and possibilities over the years. That lead to the first and only need i felt to upgrade the laptop. Since i wanted to try more and improve the performance. So i invested a whole of about 150 euros into that thing, upgrading it's RAM to the full specs the mainboard allowed (being 2.5 gigs of RAM) and giving it a higher performance and higher capacity HDD . I never used it on battery anyway, so the battery life was of no concern to me. Now i could handle more pdfs open at once and since the machine could now better buffer the filesystems, everything went more smoothly. (I have yet to really crack that 2.5 Gigs she has. Linux really optimizes itself pretty nicely in that regard and does not use much of it's swap space)

So, the machine was running pretty well. Getting mainly hungry bar the possibilities i noticed while watching LAS and other Linux media, i started to change other, older and rather unused machines to a linux setup. I kept it in the Debian family so far.

So along came KDE 4 plasma. And i fell in love again. That activity feature is a blessing for me. Boy was that one welcome. Since our group not only played one but several game systems, activities allowed me to organize the open books and documents in my virtual desktops in an activity i set up for that game. If the game session ends, i only close the activity. Then, no matter how much time has passed (could be months sometime), i just start the session again and **boom** all documents are open where i left them. A definite time-saver for me. And KDEs Okular got better faster and more performant with every update so far. And on that old machine i really felt it.

It was around the same time that Ubuntu 12.04 came around. So i braced myself, backed up everything essential used my backup script to backup several important folders for reference, compiled a list of manually installed packages and let it repack manually installed packages which weren't in any repos. Backed up the repo-gpg-keys too and upgraded.

And it went smoothly. So i set everything up, and that old laptop, which had problems running Vista, is now running KDE 4.10 in Ubuntu 12.04 LTS without much of a performance impact. Sure, it can't handle all the graphical KWin-Trickeries, but it doesn't have to. The features that count run. And they run as well as several years ago.

Last year my main machine (Windows XP) died, and i was forced to intermediately use an ancient one i had standing around. It was a Pentium IV, 3Ghz with 2 Gigs of Ram. Without really thinking i installed 12.04 on it. And it worked very well.

And now i have this nice Athlon X4 II 750k Quad Core with 32 Gigs of RAM directly in front of me. Why so much RAM? Well, i do much of administrative work and consult smaller firms in terms of IT infrastructure. Linux comes up a lot. And most of the time when i analyze a specific setup i start to setup a ton of virtual machines in a virtual lab via VirtualBox and test out a bunch of configurations before i apply my findings to the client. I also test a bunch of distros and do other stuff. I also torrent most of the distros, and at least for the download part, i don't want to constantly write to my disks. So i set myself up with a nice 10Gig ramdisk which is used for the downloading part. As soon as the torrent is complete it is automatically moved to the disk in one go and seeded from there. Thanks to tmpfs and Ktorrent which makes this a cakewalk. 

And since i'm an old-timer in this regard: I don't like where the mainstream games flow to in terms of DRM and not really owning the games you buy anymore. So i find myself more often enjoying games i find on the Humble Bundle and/or GoG. Yes, it would probably be better to only buy games that natively run on linux, but hey, i want to play my Planescape : Torment, and frankly in that situation i don't care if i have to use wine. Same for the L4D2 Session from last night ;) At least with the last one, there's a good indication that it will come to Linux as well. I'm no purist in that regard.

So yeah, at whoever wrote that crap about ""Linux always needing the newest hardware"", you're doing it wrong. I have a relatively new Ubuntu version running on rather old tech. Try that with a Windows 7 or 8 and get reasonable performance out of it.

And thanks at LAS for getting me really re-interested in all things linux and open source. Every non-virtual machine in this household now runs a linux, and guess what: They do what i want them to do.

Seafile is a git-based solution but the sync only syncs the actual documents so the extra metadata that SparkleShare and other git-based solutions have isn't an issue (you don't need to waste twice the disk space).  There is also full versioning that you can control (full history, no history, delete history after X days).

Rather than one giant folder you get different ""libraries"" which you can sync to different locations on your machines.  You can also share libraries with other users (per-library sharing policies of course).  You can also have installation-wide libraries.  I found this a lot more flexible than Dropbox.  You can also generate public sharing links to any file.

It is managed by a rather nice web UI with file previews.

It also has the option of encrypted libraries that the server has no access to.   All of the encryption and decryption is done on the clients.  (you can enter the password to use the web UI and the password is forgotten after an hour).

It also has a open source Android app available for $1 on the play store.  You can also get a build by F-Droid (a great android pick BTW) for free.  Unfortunately the app is a little lacking and there is no way to keep folders synced to the device, only downloading and uploading individual files.

I have just been playing around with it for a while and like it better than dropbox.  I defiantly recommend you give it a go.  It isn't as straight forward as btsync to set up but it has many more features and I think the sharing functionality would fit your needs well.

Cheers, and did I mention that this has been around a while and is quite stable.",,False,self,t5_2sp2j,1372462696.0,,,True,t3_1ha2mi,http://www.reddit.com/r/LinuxActionShow/comments/1ha2mi/hey_chris_i_found_your_dropbox_killer/,

They have given the Linux community so much over the years and continue to do so.  Change is a good thing, it encourages new ideas and innovations.  I personally like Unity (since 12.04) and like Gnome shell as well. I think Mir is a great direction especially if they can pull it off.  Even if they don't, they will within a few months, and if it outright fails, they will revert to X or Wayland as it becomes more mature. One of the reasons I use Ubuntu is because it is easy. I am a Developer and like spending my time doing that developing, not configuring and getting hardware to work.  As long as I can buy nice hardware that is supported Under Ubuntu, I will continue to use Ubuntu.  However with all the hate it makes me wonder if the Linux community is something I want to be a part of.  We are about freedom, open source software, and encouraging innovation.  When a company who has given so much to us without asking for anything in return is doing so why should we instantly switch to another distro and make them the enemy.  Everything I read stories about it I think, why not switch to Mac. It has awesome hardware support, large ecosystem and community, and I can get everything done I need to.  

In addition, I don't understand why everyone is jumping ship from Ubuntu, there are derivatives and if Canonical fails flat out.  Do we really think the community will let Ubuntu die?

Just installed it via a VM and thus far, yes, very geeky. And that's fine, but it does require time and commitment, which will be accounted into my overview. Arch does offer the best docs I've seen in many years which should be commended -- Ubuntu should take notes here TBH.

More to come next week during the show -- this isn't about one distro over another, rather, looking honestly at distros and their target base of user types (geeks vs casual). 

Arch's strengths are a cruft-free experience and the option of targeted customization.

The goal of this overview is to see how much time/learning/etc is involved in learning Arch, setting up a basic install and whether this is a good option for those who don't have a lot of free time. I  have no loyalty to any one distro. I run three currently. And if setting up Arch can be done with reasonably minor configuration, awesome! :)

To be clear, this applies and is a guiding light for what I'm looking at. Some CLI work is totally fine, so long as it's not a time suck.

According to this bug tracker all it takes is to open a text editor for example and type File:/// . You can also write filE:/// or FiLe:///.
Responsible for this seems to be a systemwide spellchecker which just can't handle these 8 characters.

Having this string in a text field in a browser works too and Safari will crash all tabs.

The crash creates a traceback file in ~/Library/Logs/Diagnostic Reports but opening it with Konsole causes it to crash aswell since it contains the forbidden 8 characters.

1370917620.0,24,self.LinuxActionShow,1g3b4w,Opinion of a Windows convert.,30,6,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/LinuxActionShow/comments/1g3b4w/opinion_of_a_windows_convert/,"Hi all! My name's Rob and I'm an old timer PC user. I'm actually only 30 but I've been playing with computers since my RadioShack TRS80 with its cassette-deck external storage since my dad had to spell out ""r-u-n"" to me as I typed it into the command prompt (I usually say I was 3 at that time). I remember the excitement of upgrading to Windows 3.11 (WOW! We can actually network our computers together?). Then to Windows 95 where I rigged it to boot to an MS-DOS prompt and fire up the GUI as you did in 3.x without an autoexec call. There are a whole bunch other things I remember being excited about that plenty of people don't even know we didn't have at one time.

ANYWAY, sometime right about 2001 or 2002 my dad started talking to me about this thing called Linux. Being the adventurous sorts that we were my father and I quickly made our way over to the nearest CompUSA and I grabbed a copy of MandrakeSoft Linux (my dad decided to go with some ?German? company that used a chameleon as its logo, like that would ever be popular &lt;wink, wink&gt;). We made our way back home and unwrapped our shiny new 6 and 8-ish CD cases. I threw my old 1.6 Gig hard-drive in (yes, the OS fit with room to spare) and I fired up the computer and started installing. 

To make a possibly much longer story a little shorter, nothing worked out of the box, even though I was running on three year old hardware at the time. I was a little disappointed and I basically gave up since I didn't have the patience to mess with something so basic as getting drivers to work. I've known how to make Windows do things I wanted long enough not to bother learning something new. So I gave up on Linux. For a while.

Fast forward about 10 years. I meet a friend who tells me about this free, open source OS that he uses called Ubuntu. As the computer person I was I asked a couple questions. ""Oh yeah, I know about Linux, I tried it a little back in the day."", ""Dude, you've got to give it another go, it's a whole new world!""

I'm not going to act like I've tried every Linux distro that's out there. I'm not even going to act like I've tried a lot of them. The fact is I've kind of grown out of the learning stage with computers. With 6 and 4 year-old boys I just don't take the time to mess with learning the nuances of things these days. For the most part I would install a distro and if something didn't work, I'd scrap it and move on to a different one. Printer issues with OpenSuse (yeah, they were still using the chameleon). Wireless and sound issues with Debian. To be honest I don't recall what got me away from Fedora, but thinking back it was probably something really assinine. Point being, I just wanted to get away from greedosoft and find a simple to use Linux distro that JUST WORKED. So then I installed Ubuntu. Save one or two issues with one or two specific programs it JUST WORKED like I wanted! At least for a while. Last year was my first experience with being excited about a release with Ubuntu 12.04. Up until the release date I had been telling my wife (who by now was tired of hearing me discuss all my distro hopping) that once the new version was released I'd be installing that on my laptop and leaving it alone for at least 2 years. Except I had a couple problems with it once I installed it. Compiz would crash whenever I hit the super key and started typing too fast, the customization options seemed to be slightly more limited compared to 11.10 and I had a couple other small issues that just grated on my patience. I had become so satisfied with using the open source software available through Linux that I really didn't want to go back to Windows and all of what's associated with its usage. I decided to give in to Distrowatch's page hit rankings and give Mint a try. Now if I didn't run the risk of getting flamed for praising Ubuntu, I'm sure I will get it when I comment that using Mint is as comfortable to me as if I was sitting in front of a Windows machine, but without all the restrictions I face when using Windows. EVERYTHING JUST WORKED! Except of course for the times I borked my Compiz and I would do a wipe and install. Like I said, I'm not really interested in learning all the ins-and-outs Gentoo/Arch style, I just wanted something I could customize the way I like and it would work, and I found it using Linux Mint.

If you actually sat and read through all that, I congratulate you and apologize. I've been learning enough to get me by with Linux, and I wanted to give an honest example of a Windows convert and someone coming into Linux with (almost) no programming background. If Linux is ever to make an impact in the market the way I hear a lot of people discussing and the way I'd love to be an advocate for it, we need to realize that there is nothing wrong with the Ubuntu way of compatability and ease of use. 

I don't mean any of this to talk against the power-users, I love the fact that there are so many of them. However, from the perspective of someone who just wants a computer that works as an alternative to Windows and OSX, I needed to have something that would work as well and as easily and I'm glad I found something that did. That's my story and I'm sticking to it!

1376012168.0,24,self.LinuxActionShow,1jzxky,"[Suggestion] Things to do with an old computer, maybe for /etc?",28,4,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/LinuxActionShow/comments/1jzxky/suggestion_things_to_do_with_an_old_computer/,"I had an old laptop lying around. It was a Celeron-M 1.5GHz, 256MB RAM, a non functional ethernet port(and non compatible with linux anyway), and a 40GB hard drive. The battery in it would give me warnings about only being at 49% capacity. I would have gotten maybe $10 for it if I tried to sell it.

I decided to see if I could resurrect it, and perhaps put it to task doing something else. For $25, I bought (all second hand) a Pentium-M 1.6GHz CPU, 1GB of DDR1, and a PCMCIA 10/100 NIC. Effectively it is like a RaspberryPI, but much more powerful.

I then started one by one setting up different services on it. I would set myself a task for the month, which involved learning how the service I want to run would work for a couple of days, configuring it to work, and then getting it started and pointing my other computers at it, and then spending the rest of the month documenting the process and making sure everything was stable and configured just how I like it.

I used Archlinux 32bit for the OS, since I am still in the setup phase of this project (even though it has been ongoing for about a year now) and Arch allows me to tweak things simply and quickly. Once I have everything setup exactly how I want it, I will probably switch to Debian stable and move the configuration files I have created across to Debian (shouldn't be too hard to figure out the changes between them), which saves ever having to reboot my system.

One advantage of using an old laptop is that it has a builtin ""UPS"", since the battery lasts about 2 full days without being charged (more on this later) and I am soon going to be using a 12V battery to power my ADSL(Yeah it sucks, but its all that is available atm) router, so that even in the case of a power failure I still have IRC/Internet on my mobile.

The main thing to do is to setup a pretty barebones install, with an AUR wrapper (I used packer, but anything you are used to will do), and sshd running. [Then add your keys and such to increase security and not need password to login](http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2008/11/3-steps-to-perform-ssh-login-without-password-using-ssh-keygen-ssh-copy-id/). I have yet to open up SSH to the outside world, but that is actually my task for next week, with password and root login disabled and only using SSH keys. Give it a fixed IP address (I chose 192.168.1.42)

This is what it does for me:
____

**IRC:**

This was possibly the easiest to setup. I just installed [tmux](http://robots.thoughtbot.com/post/2641409235/a-tmux-crash-course), searched around till I found a tmux configuration I liked, and ran [irssi](http://irssi.org) inside of a tmux session. I then added the following to my `~/.bashrc` file on my main desktop:

 `alias chat='urxvt -e ""jbchat""`

 `alias jbchat='ssh 192.168.1.42 -e ""tmux""` 

 and on the laptop I added

  `alias tmuxa='tmux attach'`

Then, I can make a shortcut to `chat`in my launcher and it will work, or open a terminal and run `jbchat` and it is instantly online. However, another advantage of this approach is that I can access it through my mobile, with connectbot, and when I eventually open up ssh to the outside world, I can access it from anywhere in the world. You can use [weechat](http://www.weechat.org) for this as well if you like, though I am not a fan of it.

(I still have to fix some encoding issues with this right now, but that is because of some funny issues on my end)
____
**DROPBOX:**
Dropbox is the bane of my existence. Because I have such a slow upload speed, sharing large (1GB+) files requires me to send the file somewhere, and then give the link to someone. I use dropbox for this, though I am looking into BTSync. My upload speed is terrible though, and if I upload at anything more than 90KB/s, my network comes grinding to a halt, so dropbox is the solution for non-secret, non-sensitive files. It does mean that uploading takes upwards of 5 hours, which means that I don't want to sit there and watch it, I would rather have another machine handle the task for me. So that if I want to go to sleep I don't have to have my computer on in my room.

I installed dropbox-cli on the machine, and the i3 window manager, so that I could log into the dropbox program for the first time. I logged in and removed the window manager and all the X related cruft that it put on the system, and setup dropbox-cli to run automatically at startup, and throttle itself to 50KB/s up. I initially was using lansync so that when I put a file in my dropbox on my desktop, it would sync quickly across to the laptop, and upload from there, but as with anything closed source and proprietary, that was not very reliable, so now I just use sshfs. I have a folder in my home directory on my desktop called .laptop and I use the following command when I boot my desktop to connect it: `sshfs 192.168.1.42:/home/user/ .laptop` and then everything is setup. I put the command in my .xinitrc script, so that it is connected before my desktop comes up. I then just made a symlink from ~/Dropbox to ~/.laptop/Dropbox and my dropbox folder functions exactly as it would if I had the client installed, except that I dont need to waste ~120MB of ram on it. (This setup is great for if you have an older or slower desktop, and a archaic old laptop lying around, it saves a lot of memory/cpu for this and other tasks)
____
**CPU**

I found that all the things I was doing thus far had RAM usage at ~60MB, and CPU loads were 0.00 0.01 0.02, so I decided to see how long I could make the battery last. This was simply a case of forcing the laptop to powersave mode (200MHz) and setting a little script to bump it up to full speed when I want to do something to it, and then bumping it back down when I am done. On arch this is done with [cpupower](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/CPU_Frequency_Scaling), but that has stopped working for me recently. When I migrate the system to Debian, I will be using cpufrequtils again, and I can just set powersave as the default governor.(something I need to fix, really)

When I was able to downclock it to the lowest level, I was getting 2 and a half days on the battery running most of these services. 
____
**MPD**

This was an exciting one. I mostly used the [guide on the Archwiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Mpd), for setting it up, and I used an external hard drive to store my music which I then symlinked to ~/Music. I use [ncmpcpp](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Ncmpcpp) on my desktop(though there are many GUI clients too), and MPDroid on my tablet to play music. I have started using Google Play Music on my tablet a bit, but I prefer my own setup, since I mostly purchase my music direct from the artists through sites like [myplaydirect](https://www.myplaydirect.com/). Usually, even with Brand new albums from big artists like Daft Punk, if you put in &lt;artistname&gt;.com you end up somewhere that lets you purchase direct.
____
**SQUID**

[Squid](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Squid) is a great fast internet caching proxy which is massively powerful, but which I just use as a transparent proxy to speed up accessing the internet. It works a treat, and really makes the internet fly, even on my old connection. Not really too much to setup here, except that I [turn logging off](http://wiki.squid-cache.org/SquidFaq/SquidLogs#How_can_I_disable_Squid.27s_log_files.3F) (except for cache_log, which I set to logrotate with a [cron job](http://wiki.squid-cache.org/SquidFaq/SquidLogs#My_log_files_get_very_big.21). Highly recommended. 
____
**TORRENTS**

[rtorrent](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Rtorrent), is far and away the best torrent client in existence. Nothing even comes close. It can be set to automatically torrent from RSS feeds, or monitor a directory, and has [rutorrent](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Rutorrent_with_lighttpd) as a web front end. Another advantage of doing it on the little laptop is that, as with the dropbox example, these things tend to take a long time, so you can just set it and forget it for when you don't want your main computer on all the time. As with the dropbox example above, I have a folder on my desktop symlinked to the ~/.remote/Torrents/monitor folder, and I just drop anything I want torrented in there, and it gets downloaded, processed, and moved to whatever location I want it in.
____
**FILE SERVING:**

Because of having things permanently linked through sshfs, this isn't really an issue for the linux machines in my house, (more symlinks) but for the windows machines I just cd to the directory I want to share and run `python3 -m http.server` and whatever folder I am in is shared on port 8000 as a webpage.
____
**EMAIL:**

I setup mutt on my local machine mostly using [these](http://stevelosh.com/blog/2012/10/the-homely-mutt/) [two](http://wcm1.web.rice.edu/mutt-tips.html) guides, but I used [isync](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Isync) for mail collection, with notmuch for indexing and msmtp for sending. I run mutt on my local machine, and just point the mail folder at ~/.remote/.mail/ this is handy because it collects and sorts and indexes my mail for me even while I am not home and it is all ready for me to go when I want it. It is also instantaneous and blindingly fast, and integrates perfectly with GMail for android.
____

**TODO:**

* Get an external DVD/Bluray drive and rip all my DVDs for archiving.
* Setup Headphones and Sickbeard to categorise and label all my media nicely
* Owncloud
* BTSync
* BIND DNS Caching
* MediaGoblin
* Anything else that comes to me
* Yacy
* Plex Media Server

So there you have it. Many thanks to the people who write the Archwiki, since their guides give you a great base for things, and you can then customise them for yourself. I think some of these projects would make some excellent /etc segments too.

I hope this is not the wrong place for this, but I'm sure that if it is it'll get voted down. So that kinda takes care of itself.

(for the purposes of this post, laptops are a kind of desktop PC)

I'm sick of hearing that mobile is the futre of computing and that, consequently, the desktop is dead/dying.

I do not dispute that mobile devices are the fastest growing segment of computing devices. And I do not dispute that Apple made an absolute megafuckton of money catering to that demand.

But I think those two facts have been incorrectly mythologised and extrapolated.

The desktop isn't going anywhere. Sure, it's shrinking as a proportion of computing devices. Of course it is, we're computerising everything and have, for the first time in our history, the technology to produce powerful, portable, handheld computing devices.

It's not shrinking in terms of *actual numbers* though. There are more desktop PCs in the world than there have ever been before. There are more desktop PCs out there than there were when Microsoft made Bill Gates the richest man in the world by catering to desktop PCs. There may come a point when desktop PC numbers start actually going down, but even then there will be a *fucking lot* of desktop PCs for a very long time to come.

And since, generally, we(the Linux community)'re not in the business of *selling* PCs, their declining sales are of very little concern. The number in use is what matters to us.

I have a tablet and a phone. Both run android and both are great. But I do not use either of them anything like I use my PC and neither will ever replace it. There are things I can only do on my PC and there are things I *prefer* to do on my PC because *it's inherently much better at them*.

The desktop PC is thriving. PC gaming is undergoing a renaissance. We have amazing frameworks and APIs, far more diverse and powerful than we've ever had in the past. People are using their PCs to *create* and *build* things in greater numbers than has ever been the case before.

The PC is in a fucking golden age right now. And yet everyone*'s chasing mobile.

The current iteration of Windows is the worst, and the least popular, we've ever seen. It's almost entirely unsuited to desktop use. Apple's off on an expedition to chase the cloud which is inevitably going to alienate serious desktop users. And there's a kinda hard limit on Apple's potential desktop share since there's only so many people willing to piss money up the wall.

Meanwhile Linux is perfectly placed to take advantage of this. We've finally nailed hardware support. We have a greater proliferation of pretty, usable, functional desktops than we've really seen before - they're springing up all over the place thanks, again, to those wonderful APIs and frameworks. And if you want to create and code and use those wonderful APIs and frameworks there's no better place. We've got rolling distros which is such a breath of fresh air compared to the old format and reinstall approach. We're lightweight and nimble - we'll run on anything. We've finally got fucking games. How long have I dreamt of that? Linux feels more modern, dynamic, interconnected, creative, agile. better positioned to take advantage and *be an advantage to* this renaissance than any other platform.

And what are we doing? Oh, the desktop's dead. Let's chase *fucking* mobile.

Ubuntu's basically thrown in the towel on the desktop. Ok, they have this convergence dream and... maybe, maybe. But in terms of just making the best desktop OS they can... that's not where they're focussed anymore. They fucked up the desktop and then conceded defeat at *the worst possible moment*.

And GNOME... ah, GNOME.

GNOME Shell pisses me off. Pisses me off so incredibly much. It's my favourite Linux desktop, it's the best Linux desktop I've ever used. I love it. 

And yet they continually compromise it and cripple it. It could be so much better than it is now if they'd just concentrate on trying to make the best *desktop* shell they can possibly make.

I do not believe that one shell can work well on both mobile and desktop. They're too different. Both in terms of how I use them but also, and far more importantly, in terms of *what I use them for*.

Certainly we can learn lessons from mobile interfaces. The old taskbar/menu metaphor was never great and I'm glad we were pushed into seeking alternatives. Early Unity was interesting and I love how GNOME Shell works. I love the fullscreen search with the big icons. Easier to see, easier to click, quicker. Less in my way. I love that the UI is where I need it when I need it and otherwise gets out of my face. I love the pretty hardware-accelerated transitions, it makes using my PC feel nice. (Unlike the overkill of early compiz which made my PC feel like a bag of shitty &amp; slow special effects. I'm glad we finally learned a little restraint).

But on the GNOME website - so much about touch and mobile. Who the fuck uses GNOME on a mobile device? Nobody. So, instead of catering as well as you can to the many many people who use your shell on a desktop PC you've decided to divert a significant proportion of your efforts to catering to a userbase of roughly zero. You've decided to take this potentially amazing thing and *fuck it over* in order to satisfy ... imaginary people? People who do not exist and never will exist. If it's both desktop and mobile shell, it'll be suitable for neither. Please do make a mobile shell, if you must. If you really feel there's advantage in taking a slice of that pie (I don't) then go for it. But don't try to make one thing do both - don't break my desktop chasing these imaginary users.

The final straw was this unified menu. I spent about half an hour googling trying to find out why Empathy had no menu. And then, finally, I discovered it's up in the panel? Fucking *whhhhhhhhhhy?*. This was a shit idea when Ubuntu did it and it's even shitter in GNOME. What in the fuck possible benefit does this bring to anyone? And, while we're at it, what the fuck have you done to Nautilus? 

(KDE, I should add, seem to be doing this a bit better. Vivaldi distractions aside)

I'm sick of hearing about mobile. I'm sick of having my desktop experience compromised based on a misconception and misdirected effort.

I *love* using my PC. I love making things, interacting with people, playing rich, involving, absorbing games. My PC use is an important part of my life. It's both work and hobby. It's creativity and socialisation. Fulfilling, rewearding, absorbing, challenging, engaging, creative.

My tablet/phone is a conveniece. I read emails in bed. I watch a film somewhere. I read a book. I play a mildly distracting, time-killing game. I don't love my tablet. I don't *do anything* on my tablet. Without it I'd get by just fine. It's unimportant and will remain unimportant.

**My plea** to the desktop Linux community and projects in general: 

Yes mobile is in its ascendancy. That's great, there are lessons to learn from that which can improve the desktop. But please stop chasing that platform. It's like suddenly deciding to make toasters because everyone's currently buying toasters. It's nothing to do with you. Make your desktop OS better for people who like toasters - that would be smart. Suddenly deciding to make a desktop that also works as a toaster - that would be *incredibly fucking dumb*.

The desktop PC is a bigger and more diverse and exciting place than it's ever been before. We have games on Linux, we have *Steam* on Linux. We have more open and powerful frameworks for creating things than we've ever had before. And we're better placed than anyone else to take advantage of this. **Put the toaster aside and fucking seize this opportunity**.

Or, alternatively, continue chasing wisps and then we can spend another 20 years mulling over why we failed on the desktop again.


* not really everyone, of course. Hyperbole, innit.


(I'm terribly sorry for the length and incoherence of this. I've been wanting to get this off my chest for a while and sincerely hope you do not mind my doing so here)

1373050368.0,21,self.LinuxActionShow,1hpefj,My KDE Tweaks (AKA Make KDE Less Annoying),25,4,57,http://www.reddit.com/r/LinuxActionShow/comments/1hpefj/my_kde_tweaks_aka_make_kde_less_annoying/,"*Updated ~9:15AM 07/06/13*

I've been a KDE user for over a year now, and I absolutely love it. It took me a while to take to it at first, but after I got over that first hill, I got hooked.

With KDE, you have to understand that you will have to do a bit of configuring if you are ever going to really like it. I can't stand KDE unless I make a few tweaks. Here is what I do to make KDE sane.

*Depending on your distribution, some of these tweaks may be default. I use Arch, which has pretty much no custom configs as far as I'm aware*

*This guide is based off KDE 4.10.x, but should work all the way back to 4.6.x or so, which is the earliest version of KDE I have used.*

**Disable Session Restore**
One of the first things I do when setting up a new KDE installation is disable session restore. For some reason, the idea that all the apps I had open before I shut of my computer popping back up when I turn it back on annoys me. For me, turning off my computer means that I'm done with that set of applications. I want every boot to be a fresh start.

To disable session restore, open the System Settings (**Kmenu&gt;Computer&gt;System Settings**) and navigate to **Startup and Shutdown&gt;Session Management**. Under the ""On Login"" header, select ""Start with an empty session"".

**Change the Default Cursor**
I personally can't stand the default cursor that KDE provides. I need my cursor to have a sharp point and be precise. I always change my cursor to DMZ-white.

To change your system cursor to DMZ-white or whatever cursor you prefer, open your system settings and navigate to **Workspace Appearance&gt;Cursor Theme**. If a entry labeled ""DMZ (White)"" is not present, you can install it (or whatever cursor theme you prefer) by selecting the ""Get New Theme..."" button to the right, selecting ""Rating"" under the ""Order by"" heading, and searching for ""DMZ"". At the time this was written, the white variant of DMZ was the second search result. There is also a black variant labeled ""DMZ AA"". Click the install button for your preferred theme.

**Make Workspaces Work Right**
For anyone who uses workspaces, you may be frustrated by the fact that by default even when windows are in a different workspace, they show up in the task bar, defeating the purpose of workspaces (for me). You may have checked the workpace manager's (Pager) settings, but found nothing to change this functionality. This is because the these settings are found in the Task Swither settings, not Pager's settings.

To fix this issue, right click on a blank area of the taskbar and select ""Task Manager Settings"". Under the ""Filters"" heading, select ""Only show tasks from current the current desktop"". If you have a multi-monitor setup, you can also select ""Only show task from the current screen"".

**Disable Task Manager Tooltips**
By default in KDE 4.10.x, large tooltips with a thumbnail of the windows appear whenever you hover over the task bar item for that window. I find these to be pointless and disable them.

To disable task bar tooltips, right click on a blank area of the taskbar and select ""Task Switcher Settings"". Uncheck the box labeled ""Show tooltips"".

**Tweak Krunner**
Krunner is KDE's application launcher/universal search utility. For a full list of it's functionality, see the [KDE Userbase wiki page](http://userbase.kde.org/Plasma/Krunner). It is invoked by pressing Alt+F2.

Because Krunner has so many possible sources of results, you can often get conflicts with what you actually want to find, especially when using it as an application launcher. Something else might end up higher search result then the actual app you want to launch, which slows down the process considerably.

To solve this, you can set a keyboard shortcut for a specific Krunner plugin, for example, the Applications plugin. When invoked with this special shortcut, Krunner will only search for applications (or mail, or recent document, or whatever you prefer.)

To set a keyboard shortcut for a specific plugin in Krunner, open your System Settings and navigate to **Shortcuts and Gestures&gt;Global Keyboard Shortcuts**. Select ""Run Command Interface"" from the ""KDE component"" drop-down menu. Select the shortcut you wish to change (in my case ""Run Command (runner ""Applications"" only)), select custom, click the button, and set a new shortcut. From now on, using that shortcut will open Krunner and only search with the selected plugin.

**Move/Remove the Toolbox Button**
By default in newer versions of KDE 4, the desktop toolbox button (that thing in the upper right that says ""Desktop"") is not in the corner, as it was with older versions. I always drag it to the corner, where it become a quarter circle, because it takes up less space and looks better.

If you wish to remove the toolbox button completely, you will have to install a third party widget. Right-click anywhere on the desktop. If there is a ""Add widgets"" option, then select it. If not, then you will have to unlock your widgets by selecting ""Unlock widgets"" in the same menu. A panel will slide open. Select the ""Get new widgets"" option in the upper right of the panel. Search for ""py-cashew"" and install. Repeat the process to open the widget panel, find ""py-cashew"" by using the search box, and drag it anywhere on the desktop.

Poof! Toolbox gone.

*Thanks to pierre4l, dhvl2712, and LunarProspector for pointing out py-cashew*

**Lock the Widgets**
After your all done settings up your desktop and widgets just the way you like them, lock your desktop. This will prevent you from accidently moving/deleting your widgets and will remove that little settings panel that pops up whenever you hover over a widget on your desktop. **This will also prevent little children from deleting the task bar widget again and again and again** (personal experience.)

To lock your desktop, right click anywhere on a blank area of the desktop, and click ""Lock Widgets"". There are about five other ways to do this, but this is probably the easiest way to explain.

**Change Mouse Click Settings**
By default in KDE, a single click is used to open files. Some people prefer a more Gnome-style double click, which is easy to change if you wish.

To change your mouse settings to require a double-click to open files, open your system settings and navigate to **Input Devices&gt;Mouse**, and select ""Double-click to open files and folders (select icons on first click)"" under the ""Icons"" header. Files are now only a double-click away!

**Tweak Your Fonts**
In some distributions, especially Arch, fonts can look really bad using the default settings. If your using Arch, make sure you install the ttf-dejavu package to provide some very decent default fonts. Otherwise, the Ubuntu fonts look quite nice.

To possibly improve the look of your fonts, open your System Settings and navigate to **Application Appearance&gt;Fonts** Make sure a decent font like Sans Serif or the Ubuntu fonts is in use, and enable anti-aliasing if it isn't. If you want to change all the different font settings at once, there is a ""Adjust All Fonts"" button which allows you to change certain things (such as the font itself, size, and font style) independently for all the fonts at once.

jbblaich from the comments recommends changing the DPI to 120. I've never felt a need to do this, but try it yourself and see what you prefer.

**Change Your Desktop Type to Folder View (AKA I WANT MY ICONS!)**
By default, the KDE desktop is very unlike the standard Gnome 2/Windows/MacOS/anydesktopwithicons experience. You get your desktop, and you get to put a bunch of widgets. There is a folder widget, but if you only want icons on your desktop, it can be a bit unwieldy to resize the entire folder widget to fill up the whole screen, without mentioning the fact it will ruin your desktop background.

Instead, KDE has a desktop mode where the entire desktop is a folder, much like the standard Gnome 2 experience.

To change your desktop to type to folder view, right click on the desktop, and select the bottom option in the menu that appears. For me, that's ""Default Desktop Settings"". Select ""Folder View"" from the ""Layout"" drop-down menu. Click apply. You may be done here if you want /home/$USER/Desktop to be your desktop folder. If not, open the settings panel again (it will probably be called ""Folder View Settings"" now), select location, and select the preferred folder. *Beware: I find that .desktop files don't work right unless they are in /home/$USER/Desktop*

*Optional* Select ""Display"". Make sure sorting is set to ""By Name"", and that the ""Lock in place"" (subject to opinion) and the ""Align to grid"" options are selected. Otherwise your icons will be all over the place in a rather messy arrangement. If you don't mind that, then those settings can be left alone.

**Disable File Indexing on Laptops/Older Machines**

By default, KDE 4 has file indexing services enabled by default. These services shouldn't be a problem if you have a decent computer, but for laptops it poses a resource drain.

To disable the KDE file indexing services, open your System Settings, and select the ""Desktop Search"" item. When the window opens, uncheck the three checkboxes on the first tab. Then, switch to the tab labeled ""Indexing"" and uncheck everything. After that, read the [KDE Userbase wiki page](http://userbase.kde.org/Akonadi#Disabling_the_Akonadi_subsystem) about disabling Akonadi. *As the wiki page states, you may have to take more steps to fully disable Akonadi*

**Increase/Decrease KWin Animation Speeds/Disable Window Animations**
By default, the window animation speed might feel a little to slow or a little to fast for some. It is an easy matter to change the speed of all animations at once.

To change animation window animation settings, open your system settings and navigate to **Desktop Effects&gt;General**. Select the desired speed under the ""Animation Speed"" drop-down menu.

If you wish to disable animations completly, uncheck the ""Various animations"" checkbox.

**Hopefully someone finds this guide useful and is convinced to use KDE. If you have any other questions about KDE 4, leave a comment and I'll do my best to answer them.**",,False,self,t5_2sp2j,1373123037.0,,3,True,t3_1hpefj,http://www.reddit.com/r/LinuxActionShow/comments/1hpefj/my_kde_tweaks_aka_make_kde_less_annoying/,

Really? Yeah, that's a myth.

While camera switching, live video, and stuff we do for the show isn't really doable using these methods at this time, creating great videos, is completely possible. Another myth, boom, gone.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfTB4BK9mrM

Created on Ubuntu, in Brazil. Videos created using Ubuntu, Blender, YafaRay, Cycles (via Blender), Octane Render.

I'm going to just leave this right here. ;)

Update: To reiterate -- it's more difficult and could mean extra equipment is needed. So is a better NLE needed? No, that is hogwash. Is it going to potentially make things easier/cheaper? Most likely, yes. So in the end, it's the best tool for that user or project. For legacy setups, folks use what they know.

Also, in Brazil they use Linux NLEs on Ubuntu and other region-specific distros.

I thought I'd post this fun (be it silly) guide on how you  can help us to get more news that YOU want to see, into LAS.

Because there seems to be confusion here, I've taken the liberty of creating this simple howto guide for those who want to see other types of news content in the show.

1) Convince major gaming vendors to make your favorite distro their their main focus...and not a mere afterthought after covering Ubuntu.

2) Contact the various Linux pundits out there and ask them to make sure that other distros are being covered in the news more. Oh sure, there's the fact that editors need to go with what brings in eyeballs, but don't not let that stop ya! ;)

3) Visit sources like http://linux.alltop.com/ and use Ctrl-F to highlight and then, avoid all Ubuntu content. From there, submit interesting stories to this subreddit and encourage some upvotes.

4) Contact your local LUGs and ask them to time travel back to before Ubuntu was conceived, then work with them to convince casual folks that Arch, Fedora and other distros are just as interesting. The time traveling will be challenging, but it's worth a shot.

With any luck, this will help provide a worthwhile mind-map as to how you can do your part to ensure that we invent; erp, I mean cover more non-Ubuntu news. Because clearly, when I visit news sources like http://linux.alltop.com/ and Google News, other distros are oozing out the cracks with awesome worthwhile stories. 

Truth be told, outside of Linux people and kernel changes, it's an Ubuntu world in the news. And if we miss something, you only need submit it here and convince others to vote it up. Otherwise, we cover the stories the viewers ask us to cover or that are genuinely news worthy. Because https://www.archlinux.org/news/ isn't exactly hopping with recent activity. ;) 

I think Arch Linux is awesome too, but, because it maintains a constant awesome level...it's not really bumping out the news all that often.

This PSA was made with a smile and will hopefully, provide some insight and a chuckle to boot. :)

I've got a Crucial M4 SSD in my current laptop (didn't come with it, obviously ;) ) that has my current Arch system on it, which I'm planning on just swapping into the Gazelle to make the transition a breeze. So, this'll be my first time having a laptop that's anywhere near ""high-end"".

I'm pretty pumped to get home from Uni and have this waiting there for me. 

So, since LAS pushes system76 a lot, I figured this would be a good place to be excited about this. Does anyone else have a Sys76 laptop? And if so, what do you think of it?

(And, specifically, how accurate is the order-to-ship date that System76 provides? I figure this will make it to smack-in-the-middle-of-the-US, Missouri in two weeks from now without issues, but still, one can worry.)",,False,self,t5_2sp2j,False,,,True,t3_12ncey,http://www.reddit.com/r/LinuxActionShow/comments/12ncey/system76_first_time_buying_a_nonwindows_computer/,

Oh my Mom. My mother has done things to computers that Russian and Chinese hackers spend their entire lives trying to achieve. Shes done things to Windows that I cannot explain nor reproduce. Anonymous blushes in her destructive warpath. But lets start at the beginning....

My mom is 63. Fairly old. Shes getting to that stage in her life where she doesn't want to learn anything new. If its an obstacle, its meant to be avoided. Anything new is ignored and treated with hostility. Mom wasn't always so. Mom used computers during the glory days of FORTRAN and paper punch cards. She still has a collection of those punch cards. She tells me all the time that its filled with wonderful poetry and the such. (I would love to find a dinosaur and print out all that poetry one day). Anywho, the point is that mom use to know her way around computers. Then came the big Windows boom and she had kids to deal with, so her computing days were pretty much over. 

So around the time Windows 2000 was fresh and new I decided to build mom a new PC. I thought her how to download MP3's and burn them using the popular methods at the time. I also introduced her to the magic of email and the fancy social networks. Thats when the horror started. Thats when teh phone calls started. 

I would get calls from my mom, in her thick European/Hispanic accent around 4am asking things like... ""What does it mean when it turns blue with white letters?"" or ""We need to help this poor man in Kenya whos lost his grandfathers will....."" The phone calls never stopped. Nor did the tech support and maintenance required to keep that PC alive. I was bringing that PC back from death every 2-3 days and reinstalling/restoring from backup once a month. Once she made it for 2-3 months, but thats because her wireless card was on the fritz. 

Part of the reason her PC shat the bed so often and quickly is my fault. She refuses to use firefox or chrome. I can't get her ot use noscript. Firewalls and Antivirii get uninstalled as soon as I left her room because.. ""They make things slow!"". Anything I tried to do to seccure her PC was met with old-person hostility. So its my fault cause I stopped try'n to fight it and just gave into it lol I washed my hands of the situations and just learned to let her destroy and call me to repair. Its also her fault because every piece of spammy email sent to her is a cave that needs exploring. Everything gets clicked. All the popups, all the spam, all magically appearing programs on her desktop... everything. She installed and clicked everything and quickly murdered all the hard work that I just did. 

Well, recently, I had enough of it. I walked into that woman's room and told her shes going to use Ubuntu from now and shes going to love it dammit! I says to her thats Linux or I'm throwing the PC out the window! She was very nervous. She asked all the important questions though. ""Does this Linux...can I use it to go on the Facebook?"" and ""Can I use it to listen to my musics and make CDs?"". I answered yes to all. Mom doesn't need a PC to do much. All she does is read and write email, DL, listen and burn MP3's and fill her PC with pictures of her grandson. Linux does all that and it does it well and it wont fucking shit the bed after 2 days. 

So I was originally going to install Mint 12 for her. but it gave me a crazy hard time. It just didn't want to install for some reason and I didn't want to fight it. I thought that mint might not shock her as bad as another distro might. Shes been living in Win2K and XP for years now. I wanted to get her adjusted slowly. But Mint was a no go. (Side note, Mint 12 also refuses to install on my box, but I digress) 

So I went to the backup plan. Ubuntu! It was colorful. It was stupidly simple. It looked fucking atrocious.... Mom's going to love this! So I wipe everything. Leave her backup HD alone as its got all her MP3's and pictures and I installed Ubuntu. When she first sat down her first comment was ""So fucking purple!"" and I agreed and quickly changed the desktop background. She then demanded I show her where ""Facebook, Music, Pictures and word"" were hidden. I showed her around and had her up and running in less than 1 hour. 

I haven't had a single PC related phone call since. Everything works and it works wonderfully. No crazy viruses infecting her. The best part is that she actually loves it and can uses it.

I figured I would share my story with you fine folks and LAS. 

**TL;DR after years of destroying and repairing her windows box I installed Ubuntu and she loves it and it works awesome.**

1361851705.0,17,self.LinuxActionShow,198mh5,Someone mention ZFS on Linux in the Enterprise in the last LAS episode?,20,3,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/LinuxActionShow/comments/198mh5/someone_mention_zfs_on_linux_in_the_enterprise_in/,"You can check my Reddit history, but I have made many posts regarding ZFS usage in the enterprise area.  

I started using ZFS as an experiment to replace my old HP MSA's.  They were getting older and parts were getting expensive when they needed replacing.  At the time Ultra SCSI drives were getting prohibitively expensive.  At one point, I thought would have been cheaper to replace the aging MSA's than replace all the drives.  

I built my first experimental ZFS SAN on Solaris 10 U8 at the end of 2009 to host some internal testing MySQL databases for the developers.  The reason behind it was that ZFS had a very robust and easy snapshotting ability that allowed me to roll back databases when the developers consistently broke them.  This easily saved hundreds of man hours in my department over the next year.  

I got more confident with ZFS and Solaris to the point that I upgraded to Solaris 11 Express and built a bigger SAN with 14TB of storage.  This box would host backups for my servers and databases.  IIRC, it cost me around $12,000USD to build it.  To this day, it has never failed me.  

In the interim, I did buy 3 sets of HP LeftHand SAN's for production use.  Each set was in a datacenter (local, remote, and DR respectively) and I had some random issues with them that involved whole shelves disappearing.  I did lose some data, but nothing my ZFS backup SAN couldn't fix.  

Eventually I got a pair EMC VNx series SAN's.  Never again.  I got ~14TB of usable space and the performance was very underwhelming.  This SAN housed a good amount of VM files, but nothing that should cause so many issues.  Talking to EMC reps, they wanted me to spend more money on flash cache and more licensing for deduplication and compression.  Yes, technically, that would have fixed my problems, but ZFS already had that in it and it was free.

Towards the end of 2011, I ended up returning the EMC's after 2 months of hair pulling support issues and incompetent support.  A drive died and they sent me a cable.  Twice.  I took the money I got back and built a very nice ZFS SAN that blew away anything out there.  

Here are the hardware specs:

-  CPU: 2x Intel Xeon E5-2620 (2~2.5Ghz hex core+HT)
-  RAM: 256GB DDR3 ECC (16x 16GB)
-  Motherboard: Supermicro X9DRH-7T 
-  Chassis: SC836BE16-R920B (16x 3.5"" hotswap)
-  HBA: LSI LSI00244 (16 port HBA)
-  RAID Controller: LSI LSI00301 (HBA/JBOD mode firmware)
-  L2ARC: 2x 512GB Samsung 830
-  ZIL: 32GB RAM Drive
-  OS Drive: 128GB Samsung 830
-  Storage: 16x 2TB WD RE4 (bought before Tsunami) RAIDZ2 w/ 2 hotspares

Initially, I ran FreeBSD with ZFS and had a lot of trouble with the network drivers and the HBA.  It was a deal breaker.  Instinctively, I installed CentOS 5.x on it and everything worked.  I installed the ZFS package from ZFSonLinux.org and crossed my fingers.  Everything worked.  I could create my zpools and iSCSI targets with ease.  

I eventually pointed my VMware ESX servers to the new ZFS SAN and as Chris puts it, ""Bob's your uncle"" it worked.  Every well.  Exceedingly well.  

Later I moved to build 4 more since I had enough money left over from the first one that came out of the EMC refunded money.  Talk about bang for your buck.  I designated those 4 to be part of the new cloud app my company was developing for our clients.  I paired each one together and made on an Oracle database storage and the other VM storage.  

On the stability side, I never had any issues.  I had proper hardware and OS settings.  I setup my nagios alerting accordingly and never looked back.  

The ONLY issue I ever had was having a disk die in a large RAIDZ2.  I did some maths and determined that the rebuild/resliver would take almost 6 days to complete.  I ended up stopping the ESX server off hours, destroyed the zpool, replaced the disk and recreated the zpool and restored the data.  Over 10Gbit copper it took several hours to complete the process.  My butt can only sweat for so long...

The final ZFS SAN was the mother of all backup boxes.  I mirrored the specs above (3TB instead of 2TB drives), but included an extra HBA with an external SAS port that plugged into a 4U 24 bay SuperMicro Chassis w/ 3TB WD RE4 drives in various zpools and zpool RAID types.  There is roughly 115TB (16+24 bays * 3TB) of usable storage.  That gets brought down to around ~70TB with the different redundancies in the zpool configurations.  I tuned this one differently.  Since it is almost exclusively a ""write-only"" box, I gave it 96GB RAM Disk for ZIL and a 128GB Samsung 830 for L2ARC.  I have experimented with turning compression on and off during the testing/shake-down phase and got too paranoid that the process might ruin some data and I can't get it back.  Since this is one of my last lines of defense for recovering data, I turned it and deduplication OFF.  If I could change the backup box, I would throw down some serious cash for a series of 400GB+ SLC SSD's.

So far after over a year of 24/7 operations, I have only 2 issues with hardware failure that was easily fixed.  The first, I mentioned above, the 2nd was one of my Samsung SSD's crapped out prematurely (not NAND write endurance issue).  When the SSD crapped out, I got the Nagios alert and my perfmon for the LUN on the Oracle server was showing massive IOPS issues.  This is common when you cache fails and your hitting the disk based zpool.  It took about 15 minutes to shut down the server, replace the SSD and throw in a few ZFS commands to fix the issue.  Technically, I could have done this live with the hotswap method, but I didn't want to chance anything.  This is also why I did not go with the PCI-e based SSD cards.  


All in all, it has been a very positive experience.  I have saved close to $250k in hardware, licensing and man hour costs within the first year.  I have also increase the performance of the company's cloud offering that increased the profit margins by a large percentage.  We can host 3 times the number of concurrent users with a single ZFS SAN, but would cost 5 times as much with a COTS product from EMC or NetApp.  ",,False,self,t5_2sp2j,False,,,True,t3_198mh5,http://www.reddit.com/r/LinuxActionShow/comments/198mh5/someone_mention_zfs_on_linux_in_the_enterprise_in/,

This week in the LAS show notes I'll be linking an **[Amazon.com wishlist](http://www.amazon.com/gp/wishlist/2LZEF2QCAHPEL/ref=reg_hu-rd_add_wl)** to address the major storage issues in the studio. 

I wanted to give you guys first crack at supporting the network, since once the shows published they (hopefully) will go quick. My thought was to name each drive in the server after the person that contributed that drive. It's just a small silly thing, but each drive has a notes filed associated with it, and I'll use that filed to flag the drive as ""owned"" by that person.

So in a sense, part of the networks storage will live on a drive owned by you. 

To be clear, it's all kinda stuff that's going to go on that. Terabytes and terabytes of JB files. Once these drives are in, I'll be pulling the production assets out of dropbox, and centralizing on this array. 

It's also going to house my personal junk, like movies, pictures, music. So its a mix of work and play.  

This time around I'm making it as redundant as I can, loosing arrays this big hurts! And it defiantly was not in the plans to drop a bunch of cash on replacing existing drives, I hate just treading water when dropping that much cash.  

Between these drive failures, the replacement of the studio Hackintosh, and upgrades on the studio's network connection (more on that in this week's TechSNAP), my summer budget is totally shot. So I'm hoping to get some help, so we can keep pushing out big shows every week!

So if you want to pitch in, be sure to leave your name in the notes filed so I can name the drive after you!",[JB news],False,self,t5_2sp2j,False,,5,True,t3_1irole,http://www.reddit.com/r/LinuxActionShow/comments/1irole/hard_drives_for_jupiter_looking_for_help_in/,moderator

Here's a couple of screenshots of my current Arch install with KDE on my laptop. Keep in mind that I recently switched to KDE after being a long time Xfce user, so what you see in the screenshots is still a work in progress (although I've got most things configured the way I like).

* [No windows](http://i.imgur.com/oXejH4B.jpg)
* [KWrite and Konsole](http://i.imgur.com/tEs2PaT.png)

The KDE theme is pretty much the stock Oxygen theme, except that I've made the window background and button background a little lighter (I didn't like the stock gray color).

The GTK theme I use is [oxygen-gtk](http://kde-look.org/content/show.php/?content=136216), which pulls in colors from your KDE theme to make GTK apps integrate better. Note that GTK2 apps (like Firefox), do not integrate very well with a dark KDE theme if you're using oxygen-gtk, but it works fine with a light theme like mine.

The theme for the bottom panel is called Produkt, and is available in stock KDE. The Arch logo on the far left of the panel is actually the standard KDE menu (which I don't really use, so I may end up getting rid of it). Right next to that is the workspace viewer, so that I can see at a glance which windows are where. On the right side of the panel, you'll see 4 system monitor widgets: a cpu monitor, a memory monitor, a disk activity monitor, and a network activity monitor. All four of these monitors are available in stock KDE.

The astute observer will notice that I don't have any application launcher icons anywhere. The reason for this is that I prefer to bind my most-used apps to keyboard shortcuts, and I launch the rest with KDE's built in Run Command interface (similar to Synapse or Gnome Do). I prefer a more keyboard-centric workflow.

The KWrite theme is Solarized Dark. The Konsole theme is called Dark Pastels. Both KWrite and Konsole are using the DejaVu Sans Mono Book font, at size 9. As for fonts in general, two must-have font packs for me are DejaVu TTF and Liberation TTF.

Here's my regular user's PS1: \\[\033[00m\\][\\[\033[01;32m\\]\u@\h \\[\033[01;34m\\]\W\\[\033[00m\\]]\$ 

And here's root's PS1 (it's the same format, but it highlights the user and hostname red instead of green): \\[\033[00m\\][\\[\033[01;31m\\]\u@\h \\[\033[01;34m\\]\W\\[\033[00m\\]]\$ 

Here's a [pastebin of my irssi theme](http://slexy.org/view/s20HjhB3Wl), which is somewhat modified from the default:  Note that my terminal colors are fairly subdued due to the Dark Pastels terminal theme, so the colors specified in my irssi theme will likely appear more vivid on most terminals.

Whenever I get really busy, and have to stop and troubleshoot something I typically would not have to fiddle with, I start to weigh the benefits of staying with Arch. 

But I am surprised by this revelation: It's the little things. Not the big things that really get me. The stuff that interrupts real work, because I made an assumption that something would just work.

The SD/USB Stick that does not show up in the file manager, or having to read the Wiki just to get VirtualBox to start. Those kinds of things which would require zero-effort on a distro like Ubuntu or openSUSE drive me nuts under Arch. It's the stuff you don't expect to be a problem. 

I guess I can't escape this feeling that computers are suppose to be good at this stuff now. I've paid my dues, I've already fought these battles. 

At the end, so far at least, AUR, fresh software, and sticking closer to up stream is keeping me on Arch.

**Just to be clear:** Everything is working, and I'm still on Arch. I'm just starting to question the trade off in surprise productivity hits. Today's splash of cold water came as I was trying to quickly test something in a VM, and ended up spending 10/15 minutes loading kernel modules, reading wikis, and adding my self to groups. *NOT* overly difficult. Time consuming. I expected VirutalBox to start, and for me to get work done. That's not what I got.

I think the advantages still outweigh that disadvantage, and I'd suspect it becomes less and less of an issue the older the install gets.

In this age of glitzy geek gadgets and hi-tech Tux-supporting tablets, super smartphones and easily Linux-loaded nubile notebooks, I thought I'd throw in a blast from the Linux past (though still 'current' for me). Matt has mentioned that he still has a System76 laptop running from 2008. Well, I can do a bit better than that. Matt also holds the view that anybody wanting to run Linux and not buying from a Linux-friendly vendor only has themselves to blame when things go Tux-shaped, so he should be proud of my efforts detailed below.

We see new hardware mentioned and discussed every week on LAS and in this subreddit, but perhaps it's worth remembering that not all of us have such sophisticated kit at our disposal. As somebody loathe to throwing something out so long as it fulfils some purpose, and not in the best financial health to afford a replacement anyway, here's what I'm still using as my main machine:

(keyboard removed for maintenance in the above image)

Eight years ago today in a more high-flying point in my life (literally), I managed to persuade my ex-boss in the UK that since the company owed me some money, for my upcoming trip to a client in San José, California, they could afford to divert my return flight via Atlanta and put me up for a couple of nights there. The reason: I ordered a custom laptop from [Emperor Linux](http://www.emperorlinux.com/), and wanted to go and collect it by hand to save expensive shipping charges to Britain. Never heard of Emperor Linux? They don't seem to have established themselves with regular consumers as well as other suppliers like System76 have, perhaps because they cater more to enterprises, large-scale school and university orders, or perhaps because they don't have a strong marketing team and haven't really changed their website in almost a decade.

The model I ordered, for a whopping $2,835 was the Silver Comet, essentially an overpriced Sony VAIO S270P with the following average specs: 13.3"" 1280x800 x-brite screen, 4 pounds weight with battery giving max 3 hours on a good day for the first few months, 1.7GHz Pentium M with Centrino 2200b/g, 512mb RAM, 60gb 4200rpm HD, 64mb ATI Mobility Radeon 9700, DVD-RW, Memory Stick slot, empty PCMCIA slot, 2xUSB, Firewire (Sony bastardised version), and pre-loaded and configured with the distro of my choice (I opted for 'SuSE Linux Professional'). I ordered a dual-boot WinXP model 'just in case', and it had a rescue partition running the 2.2 kernel, in addition to a few custom Emperor Linux tweaks. It also sported a couple of Emperor Penguin stickers as seen in the picture linked above, one proudly adorning the lid, the other taking the place of the Windows sticker alongside the usual ATI and Centrino suspects.

The invoice from the 22nd April 2005:

Lest we forget that back in 2005, pre-loaded Linux laptops were hard to come by, and buying a regular laptop and expecting all its hardware to happily play penguins was fraught with pitfalls. I'd only discovered a couple of Linux laptop specialists online, one of whom ignored my emails. (I believe that was Linux Certified. I note the T&amp;C's on their site drift into concerns about products exported abroad being used for weapons of mass destruction - maybe that's what they were worried about). Indeed, Emperor Linux also ignored me at first, even when I was offering to place an order, causing me to have a bit of a moan and eventually convince them that I wasn't some European scamster but a rare individual customer genuinely intent on circumnavigating half the globe to come and collect the machine in person.

Over in Atlanta, the founding head of the company, Lincoln Durey, came to meet me and present me with my laptop. I think he eyed me with a little suspicion, probably wondering if some kind of credit card fraud was going to come his way soon or perhaps thinking I was a secret shopper from a Linux mag or website checking out his HQ in preparation for a potentially scathing review. I never did provide any such thing. Until now, that is. He probably never expected a review of one of his products to pop up on the Internet eight years after sale.

There had been heavy thunderstorms over Atlanta that morning. I'd witnessed zaps of lightning myself striking the neighbouring skyscraper in the city centre, and when I reached the multi-storey block out in the suburbs where Emperor Linux were housed, they'd been struck too and had a power outage all morning, so Lincoln advised that he'd therefore not had time to do all the installation checks and routines that he normally would. It was only hours later that Friday evening back at my hotel that I was already on the phone requesting support, to which I noted a few sighs and a desire to get this weird customer off the line and consigned to the invoice archives.

In the months that followed, during the period of free support offered, I had one or two further issues and my emailed questions sometimes went unanswered or not answered very satisfactorily. Due to Britain's ridiculous mobile phone pricing plans, it was cheaper for me to call the States than to call somebody next door on another network, so I would end up calling their telephone support to resolve matters. I can't honestly say that their customer service was all that responsive. (If anybody else has purchased from Emperor Linux, especially more recently as they're still going, it would be interesting to hear about your experiences).

For the first eight months I barely used the machine since I needed to back up and transfer all my data from my old Windows box, then learn how to adapt to Linux alternatives. I was frequently out on the road, so needed a good break to sit down and figure it all out. The wireless didn't initially work well, so I relied on the internal 56k modem using the paid-for Linuxant driver, sometimes plugging it into hotel phone sockets for minimal travelling entertainment at sky-high prices. After some months, it came to a point where I wasn't happy with the outdated SuSE 9.2. Indeed, I'd ordered and paid extra for 9.3 (shown on my email invoice but not the paper one), which had just been released a couple of weeks before my purchase, but apparently Emperor Linux couldn't get the box set ordered in time, though they never deducted the extra. I wiped all the custom tweaks and did a stock install of openSUSE 10.0, and from thereon have gone on to upgrade through every version of openSUSE since, now running 12.3. What amazing longevity Linux offers. You can't do that with some alternative OS's. Imagine trying to install Windows 8 on this thing!

The Emperor Linux customizations included their own modified kernel, packages to control power, brightness and function keys, and a rescue system. They seemed to be Red Hat / Fedora oriented and much of this special functionality such as the hibernation required command line action, so I never got stuck in and instead hoped a stock SuSE install would work, which it mostly did. I rarely ever booted into the WinXP partition. When I did, I was greeted by a hideous cacophony of pop-ups and warnings, update reminders and pointless icons along with the usual bloatware and Sony media crapware, most of which I hastily removed so I could free up space and later shrink the Windows partition. It made me appreciate what a joy booting into Linux was in comparison. How can the rest of the world put up with that rubbish on a daily basis?

Not everything has been perfect under Linux. It took many releases of openSUSE before one that recognised the Memory Stick slot or provided proper touchpad scrolling. Suspend to RAM didn't work for a few years, and then when it did suspend to disk stopped working properly. Some function keys have always misbehaved (though are working better than ever under 12.3) and the ATI graphics card has always been practically redundant. The Catalyst drivers never installed correctly, then support for this generation of card was dropped only a couple of years later, whilst the open source Radeon drivers have been prone to all sorts of issues ranging from glitches to crashes. It's one thing that puts me off laptops, the inability to switch graphics cards. I'd so much rather have an nVidia in there. Their legacy driver is a godsend for folks like me.

Most users would have ditched this notebook long ago at the first sign of trouble. Indeed, the Interwebs are full of forum posts from folks with the same hardware issues I've encountered who gave up many years ago and simply got a replacement computer. Sony VAIOs have a renowned reputation - for being crap and overpriced. Just weeks after purchase, the stupid flimsy plastic battery clip broke, meaning the underside's been held together with gaffer tape ever since. But I refuse to cave in and add to the ecological catastrophe of plundered rare earth resources and limitless landfills of redundant gadgets. When I bought the laptop, considering the cost, I determined that I should get at least 5 years' use from it to have justified the investment, and 7 years would be better. Well, to be fair to Sony, this device has beaten my expectations, now reaching the ripe age of 8, though not without a few more pounds and pennies spared here and there.

The RAM was maxed out after a few years to 1GB. The vendor, Crucial, wouldn't stock this part on their UK site and in order to buy it from the US, they offered me no other option than to scan and email (insecurely) copies of personal documents like my passport and credit card, against all my advice to them that this was terrible security practice. Next issue was the fan which became increasingly noisy. A full strip-down and a vacuum cleaner sorted that out a couple of times but eventually I had to source a replacement. The tiny power ribbon cable which I'd had to tug out during these strip-downs also became worn resulting in a dead machine. At that point I almost gave up, but I found it was possible to strip away the plastic covering and make it work again, though only after I'd already sourced an obscure and rare replacement part. Finally, following repeated thumping and the inability to control my own temper, I trashed the hard drive and had to buy a higher capacity 160GB IDE model. But me being me, I didn't let the old drive go to waste either. Only one partition (/home) seemed damaged so I zero'd the drive, noted where it had trouble performing this action, repartitioned it just before this point and stuck it in an external case to hook up to my old desktop as media storage, where it still runs fine. Did I mention my thirteen-year-old desktop? Ah, there's another story for another day (along with my ten-year-old digital camera, my twenty-five-year-old car, my collection of Atari 2600 VCS games consoles and my thirty-year-old Betamax video recorder. I expect things to last!) (or maybe I'm just stuck in the past)

How much more life can I eek out of this laptop? Eight years isn't necessarily special. IBM Thinkpad owners used to boast about passing the decade mark. So long as the screen bulb doesn't blow and until the fan gives up again, probably less 24 months away, I can put it to some use, but I must admit it's getting very sluggish. Having Firefox and Thunderbird running constantly consumes most of the 1GB memory and leaves little for simple KDE functions like file browsing in Dolphin, resulting in long waits for windows and icons to appear. I do run full compositing and 6 KDE activities nonetheless :)

Maybe this machine would be better suited to passing its silver(comet)-haired years in a retirement home by functioning as some kind of simple media server stashed away in a noiseproof cupboard.

As for a replacement, the Lemur Ultra model offered by System76 looks remarkably similar to my Silver Comet in styling and would be a nice and fairly affordable upgrade in many ways, although despite being a tiny bit larger, the screen resolution offers less vertical pixels than my current model, and I'm torn between getting another laptop or going back to a desktop machine where I feel more comfortable getting work done. What's more, I am certainly no longer in the sort of position whereby my employer would post me to the other side of the planet to pick up a System76 in Seattle, so there's international delivery costs to factor in. For the moment, I think I might just keep holding out until this thing literally falls apart (next time I lose my temper).",[Runs linux] ,False,self,t5_2sp2j,False,,,True,t3_1cvuzw,http://www.reddit.com/r/LinuxActionShow/comments/1cvuzw/my_venerable_laptop_an_eightyearold_king_of_the/,

Well back in 2006ish i started to dabble around with linux and was like a kid in a sweet shop. But i hit a road block when i tried KDE, I HATED IT BACK THEN. It was so slow and buggy on a old system back then i stayed away ever since.

Yesterday i started to get those itchy linux feet where i couldn't stay still on what i was using. Instead of distrohopping i thought i would give KDE another go and force myself to stay with it for at least a month.

What i think so far

**Bad Points:**

* Shit Default settings, But easily fixed with some tweaks!

* Way to much customization options, If i was jumping into linux for the first time this would make me jump straight back winblows.

**Good points so far**

* Kwin is a really good wm

* Can look stunning with a lot of work to set up.

Will i stay with KDE? ill let you know in four weeks and update this post!

1375719200.0,14,self.LinuxActionShow,1jqwcj,LAS is starting to show some fatigue,60,46,147,http://www.reddit.com/r/LinuxActionShow/comments/1jqwcj/las_is_starting_to_show_some_fatigue/,"I want to preface by saying that I watch and love the majority of the Jupiter Broadcasting shows. Chris puts a lot of effort into performing in and producing them every day of the week and he has the best podcast network on the internet hands down.

Lately I have been losing interest in LAS the past few months and I have been watching more out of habit lately for my Monday routine. It provides a great source for Linux news, but I think the show is starting to show some fatigue and like SciByte, I think there is one big issue: **lack of chemistry between the hosts**.

In comparison to other shows on the network, this is what I have noticed:

**Unfilter** - The show has elevated to one of the more interesting on the network with the coverage of the NSA leaks and you can really tell that Chase and Chris are VERY passionate about the show and the material every week. Chase has an excellent radio voice to complement the production values of the show and gets Chris very energetic as a result. The show is a joy to listen to every week.

**TechSNAP** - Allan is very smart and knows what he is talking about. He discusses very technical things every week and is easy to follow and understand in a very soothing voice. Him and Chris have a history and it shows in their banter back and forth. I leave every episode learning something new.

**Coder Radio** - Michael Dominick has a voice that is catered well to radio and like Chase of Unfilter, really gets Chris involved and passionate about the programming industry. They joke around a lot and Chris is always playing sound clips of Michael's voice. A truely unique show.


So back on LAS. The show is still important as far as Linux podcasts go, but Chris seems low energy and sometimes forced in his engagement with Matt. Matt seems to be a nice guy, but he doesn't have the stage presence to carry a show (like Chase) and in return it makes Chris look like he is running through the motions. When Lunduke hosted, he was very theatrical and could turn a boring subject interesting.

I know this was a long post and some may take this as trolling, but I am wondering if anyone else has felt this about LAS after watching it lately.",,False,self,t5_2sp2j,1375727996.0,,,True,t3_1jqwcj,http://www.reddit.com/r/LinuxActionShow/comments/1jqwcj/las_is_starting_to_show_some_fatigue/,
