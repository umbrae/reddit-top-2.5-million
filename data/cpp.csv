I had a C++ phone screen and I thought some people might be interested in seeing the questions that were asked. Here they are:

If you could change one thing about the C++ language, what would you change and why? What are some limitations of c++?

Could you explain to me how virtual functions work? and why you would use them?

What is the overhead of calling a virtual function?

Are there any situations when this overhead is larger or smaller?

When should you make a destructor virtual?

Could you explain to me the difference between static_cast and dynamic_cast?

How would you implement a class that opens two files if you could not use exceptions?

How would you implement that class with two files using exceptions?

How would you handle one of the files failing to open in the case where you have exceptions?

Could your constructor throw an exception after one of the files had been opened and the 2nd one failed? Which destructors would be called in this case? (assumes use of RAII for file handling (which is how I answered the previous questions))

How would you find the 10 most used words used in a large text file (which was a novel)? file -&gt; words -&gt; hashmap&lt;string word, int count&gt; -&gt;keep track of top 10 using a vector

It seems I should use getline and check if the first character is *, and if not assign the two integers, but I'm having trouble converting the string into two integers.

for example:


ifstream infile(""input.ini"");

tl;dr: Signal to noise is getting low. Can we do something about it?

Lets get down to business. /r/cpp isn't a huge subreddit. Of late, we've had a higher-than-normal percentage of ""help me, I'm new"" posts. I'm very supportive of new cpp programmers looking for answers to their questions, however, I feel that posting these questions to /r/cpp is misplaced, especially since it is such a (relatively) small community. I vote that these sorts of posts to /r/cpp should be discouraged in general and redirected to a site more suited to helping people with questions, such as stackoverflow.com. Anecdotally, per-capita, users are much more likely to find real answers to their questions about c++ on stack overflow than reddit, by design.

Reddit's original purpose was as a news aggregation website. I know that, over the years, this intention has become just that, only an intention, and that reddit has outgrown this to become a sort of community. I support the community aspect as well, in the general sense. However, I feel that straying too far from this original intention is detrimental to reddit as a whole, and that /r/cpp has strayed or will stray too far.

Take /r/hardware (28.5k redditors subscribed), /r/tech (5280 redditors subscribed) and /r/networking/ (6930 redditors subscribed), for example. These are what I would consider only slightly pathological cases of where this behavior can and likely will go. 

86/100, 93/100, and 84/100 of the posts on my version of their front pages are to self.hardware, self.tech, and self.networking, respectively. These posts aren't news. These posts aren't community. This is abuse. Most of these posts have less than 10 replies, and since this is still reddit, how many of those are acutal answers to the OP's question? I don't even mean the silly memes and youtube-style comments. Most of these replies are baseless opinions that serve only to increase the noise-to-signal ratio. They do not help the OP. IMHO, this is unacceptable, and this is where /r/cpp will end up without moderation.

As a community and as a news aggregation website, how do you folks feel about redirecting these post to where they're more useful, such as stack overflow?

I thought I'd share it:

    template&lt;class I, class O&gt;
    function&lt;O(I)&gt; memoize(function&lt;O(I)&gt; f) {
        // Keep copies in the map of parameters passed as references
        map&lt;typename std::decay&lt;I&gt;::type, O&gt; memos;
        return [=](I i) mutable -&gt; O {
            auto it = memos.lower_bound(i);
            if (it == memos.end() || it-&gt;first != i)
                it = memos.insert(it, make_pair(i, f(i)));
            return it-&gt;second;
        };
    };

    int main(int argc, char** argv) {
        function&lt;long(const int&amp;)&gt; fib;
        fib = [&amp;](const int&amp; n) -&gt; long {
            return n &lt; 2 ? n : fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2);
        };
        fib = memoize(fib);
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 100; ++i) {
            cout &lt;&lt; i &lt;&lt; "": "" &lt;&lt; fib(i) &lt;&lt; endl;
        }
        return 0;
    }

The map is *copied* into the closure, where it is mutated to record new results (only allowed by the use of the **mutable** modifier). Note that thread safety isn't addressed here, but could trivially be added.

In C#, we have things like FxCop to alert you when you've written something against best practices, etc. Is there something like this for C++?

I'm using Visual Studio 2013, and having little previous C++ experience, my memory management skills are not exactly great, but VS will alert you in the output window when you've left objects alive, so that helps.

I don't really use any of the C++11 smart pointers right now (I'm much more focused on the DirectX bits of my engine working), but are they something you should be using whenever you create a pointer to something?

What about memory management within functions? e.g. if I create a std::ostringstream inside a function, do I need to delete it before the function returns? What effect do orphaned objects have on a running program other than increasing memory usage? I *assume* when a program exits with live objects they're cleaned up by the OS, so is it necessary to delete objects that are only ever dereferenced when the program exits (e.g., an ID3D11Device)?

Also, exceptions can be hard to decipher. Is there a way to somehow make them more useful?

Last but not least: When you write a function prototype in a header, you have to go back to the cpp and manually enter in the signature. Why doesn't Visual Studio update function sigs in the .cpp/.h file automatically? It doesn't seem like it's a difficult task so I'm wondering if there's a good reason this isn't implemented. It's always a massive pain-in-the-ass to me to create a new class because I end up writing more than I feel I need to. Is there an extension or something that will update the .cpp file to match the .h?

Thanks!

**EDIT:** Thanks for the responses, they've been immensely helpful. Apparently VS does have some static analysis tools in it, I'm going to check those out. 

**EDIT 2:** Either I've written really good code or the code analysis in VS2013 is not all that great. I had just three analysis results. I've seen a few commercial analysis tools but I think I'm just gonna stick with the built-in stuff.",,False,,t5_2qi27,1375675909.0,,,True,t3_1jplfw,http://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/1jplfw/what_out_there_can_help_me_to_write_better_c_code/,

1340791709.0,49,self.cpp,vog1p,A commonly unknown std::vector pitfall,62,13,36,http://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/vog1p/a_commonly_unknown_stdvector_pitfall/,"This is a pitfall, that is not described in any C++ documentation or the C++ standard documents (including the most recent C++11 standard): when inserting elements to a vector using either insert() or push_back(), you should never pass a reference to an element from that vector. Casually, that could look like the following:

    v.push_back(v.front() );

Now, the documentation of vector often says that push_back and insert invalidate iterators (in case you don't watch capacity()). That could already give a hint, though the same applies to a C++11 unordered_multimap/set, but those explicitly *don't* invalidate references.

How ever that might be, I've seen code like the above a few times now, and also written it myself, so that I think it should be pointed out more clearly.

The details are as follow:

In case of the vector ""running over"", it will be reallocated, which means that a new buffer is allocated, the existing items are copied over and the old buffer is then deallocated. At that time, the reference will be invalid. Now, there are 2 cases:

1. The value object has a destructor that does some real cleanup, making the element invalid. In this case you are guaranteed to get a problem sooner or later, unless you somehow have code that by ""accident"" never calls the problematic push_back/insert in the moment a reallocation is needed.

2. The value object is some kind of plain data, that is just ""abandoned"". In this case it is even more complicated: Since the buffer will be deallocated and then read, it will perform an invalid read operation. Now it depends on the platform, what exactly happens. To make a long story short, since modern platforms feature an MMU, this could raise an exception. Or you could be ""lucky"", that the standard library or OS is a little slower, which means that you will be allowed one more time to read the data even after deallocation.

In case of insert, the same problem can happen as described above, or even without reallocation: If the value you want to copy is on/after the insert position, you will either read the wrong value or a deconstructed value.

So this is it. Maybe all of this is completely clear to you and you would never make such a mistake. But my experience shows that this error can be made more easily, especially in case of push_back(), because you never even use an iterator, so the warning that iterators get invalidated seems to not apply to this case. It is especially nasty, because there are possible combinations where it is literally impossible to reproduce the problem on your development machine, but it will randomly crash on some other machine, maybe only once in a while.

EDIT: this also applies to std::deque and its push_front() function.

UPDATE: It looks like this is not an oversight in the language, but a bug in a certain STL implementation, [details](http://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/vog1p/a_commonly_unknown_stdvector_pitfall/c56o7f1).",,False,,t5_2qi27,1340865571.0,,,True,t3_vog1p,http://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/vog1p/a_commonly_unknown_stdvector_pitfall/,

&gt;Trivia : idTech4 high level objects are all abstract classes with virtual methods. This would normally involves a performance hit since each virtual method address would have to be looked up in a vtable before calling it at runtime. But there is a ""trick"" to avoid that. All object are instantiated statically on the heap as follow:

        
        
    idCommonLocal    commonLocal;                   // Implementation
    idCommon *       common = &amp;commonLocal;         // Pointer for gamex86.dll
        
        
&gt;Since an object allocated on the heap has a known type the compiler can optimize away the vtable lookup. The interface pointer is used during the handshake so doom3.exe can exchange objects reference with gamex86.dll. 


I don't really understand how this actually optimizes the vtable lookups away.  Could someone shed some light on it for me?  Thank you.",,False,,t5_2qi27,False,,,True,t3_x3bqg,http://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/x3bqg/doom_3_vtable_trick/,

I wanna find out if your expericnce of working as a C++ programmer is anything like mine.

I have changed jobs lots mostly because I got stuck working in messy code bases. The  people I worked with have not been interested in reading any of the C++ best practices books. Its like, you learn the syntax when you are in school and that's pretty much all there is to C++.

I think being a good c++ programmer isn't about memorizing syntax, but knowing how to write clean, maintainable, efficient, and safe code. And that is something you just wont learn in the trenches, no matter how long you have been there, but something you have to pick up by studying best practices books.

It seems to me there is mostly low quality code out there, and not so good C++ programmers. I have not seen much of that *Effective C++* or *Exceptional C++* type  code in the wild. Its a bit depressing really. I wont pretend I always write good code, or that I remember all the patterns, best practices and gotchas. But I know what ugly code looks like and always trying to improve by studying the books.

**So I got a few questions: Do you think being a good C++ programmer means reading lots of C++ books? Do you think most C++ code out there is ugly and most C++ programmers are a bit bad. What is your experience?**

The reason I'm asking is because I'm changing jobs again.. but it will probably just be more of the same. Is all companies like this? Or is there some industry or some types of companies that care more about code quality than others?

Some definitions:

*Good code* as in: RAII, exception safety, small interfaces, short methods, STL algorithms, unit tests, data hiding, composition before inheritance, do-as-the-int's, mixins, pimpl's, patterns etc..

*Bad code* as in: huge classes, big nested functions, copy paste spaghetti code, C style code (polymorfism by void pointers, casting, and type switches), goto, reiventing wheels, macros, global variables, etc

What type of C++ books am I talking about here? Well here is a list of the ones I have read (Herb Sutters books are my favorites, but Scott Meyers books are probably a better place to start) :

* C style, very imperative and manually managing all memory (but with new's and deletes - I was never insane enough to use malloc/free!). C++ arrays and pointer arithmetic all over the place.
* Object orientation *everywhere*! The more layers of abstraction and the more virtual functions the better! In fact, let's make every function virtual!
* Full use of STL containers
* Function pointers and preprocessor used to allow me to never repeat code or logic more than once
* Mild use of templates to replace function pointers/preprocessor macros, but most program logic is still imperative
* Limited use of STL algorithms if ones a great fit, I don't have to write any custom functors and I don't run into too many scary error messages.
* (*current*) Full use of STL and boost libraries and custom generic extensions. Very very limited use of object orientated code, lots of use of functional style of coding. Extensive use of RAII and the various STL/boost classes to help (eg. shared_ptr) - I can't remember the last time I used delete!

&gt; The most vexing parse is a specific form of syntactic ambiguity resolution in the C++ programming language. The term was used by Scott Meyers in Effective STL (2001).[1] It is formally defined in section 6.8 of the C++ language standard.

A simple example:

    #include &lt;iostream&gt;
    
    struct A {
    };

    struct B {
        B(A a) {
            std::cout &lt;&lt; ""B ctor\n"";
        }
    };

    int main() {
        B b(A());
        return 0;
    }

You might think this code should call B::B(A) and ""B ctor"" will print on stdout, however:

    $ g++-4.7 -Wall -std=c++11 mvp.cc 
    $ ./a.out 
    $

*Wat?* Did g++ really just ignore the declaration of the variable 'b' with no warning? Well...no, it interpreted it as a function declaration instead of a variable definition.

To prove this, we can modify the code to print type_info:

    #include &lt;iostream&gt;
    #include &lt;typeinfo&gt;
    
    struct A {
    };
    
    struct B {
        B(A a) {}
    };
    
    int main() {
        B b(A());
        std::cout &lt;&lt; typeid(b).name() &lt;&lt; ""\n"";
        return 0;
    }

This will print the RTTI name, which is mangled, but c++filt can demangle it for us:

    $ ./a.out | c++filt -t
    B (A (*)())

Lets break this down. 'b' is declared as a function that returns type 'B' and takes a single argument that is a function pointer. The argument to 'b' is an unnamed function that returns type 'A'. Another way of writing this out would be:


    #include &lt;iostream&gt;
    #include &lt;typeinfo&gt;
    
    struct A {
    };
    
    struct B {
    };
    
    typedef A (*afunc)();
    
    B b(afunc);
    
    int main() {
        std::cout &lt;&lt; typeid(afunc).name() &lt;&lt; ""\n"";
        std::cout &lt;&lt; typeid(b).name() &lt;&lt; ""\n"";
        return 0;
    }

And we get:

    $ ./a.out | c++filt -t
    A (*)()
    B (A (*)())

The crux of the problem seems to be that C allows you to drop the

    (*)

from

    A(*)()

which is what causes B b(A()) to be interpreted as a function declaration.

How to avoid this? C++11 has a feature called [Uniform initialization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B11#Uniform_initialization) that introduces this syntax for calling constructors, which is unambiguous:

    B b{A{}};

    $ g++-4.7 -Wall -std=c++11 mvp.cc 
    $ ./a.out 
    B ctor
    $

At this point you might be tempted to change your code to always use {} instead of () when calling constructors. However, {} also has an edge case. For example:

    #include &lt;vector&gt;
    #include &lt;iostream&gt;
    
    int main() {
        std::vector&lt;int&gt; v1(100, 0);
        std::cout &lt;&lt; v1.size() &lt;&lt; ""\n"";
    
        std::vector&lt;int&gt; v2{100, 0};
        std::cout &lt;&lt; v2.size() &lt;&lt; ""\n"";
        return 0;
    }

These are not the same:

    $ g++-4.7 -Wall -std=c++11 test.cc 
    $ ./a.out
    100
    2

'v1' calls the vector constructor that creates a vector of 100 items initialized to 0.

'v2' calls the constructor which takes a std::initializer_list&lt;int&gt; of items to add to the vector.

Take away:

 * Be especially careful when calling constructors. Watch out for initializer_list constructors.
 * Write tests.
 * Try compiling your code with clang++ 3.1 for the diagnostics. Unlike g++-4.7, it will actually warn about vexing parse.
 * Remember this before submitting bugs to gcc so you don't get shamed on bugzilla.
 * Be very careful when adding initializer_list constructors to your existing classes. They will become the preferred constructor and can change the meaning of existing code that might have been calling a different constructor.

The ones that I know about are:

* Autotools. We all know the pain that goes here
* CMake. This is better than Autotools, but not by a lot
* SCons. ""We'll write a system that lets you write an entire Python program to power your build system"". The MongoDB SConstruct file is approaching 2,000 lines long last time I looked!
* Waf. Similar to SCons but you distribute the waf program with your source tree as well. The wscript file for node.js was over 1,000 lines long again!
* BJam. I've not looked at this an awful lot yet, and I do intend to do so, but I have memories of Boost being painful to build...
* Write your own Makefiles. This is always an option, but again painful to maintain - especially if you want to work cross-platform, which the above are all meant to make easier. (Hah!)

I know there are a bunch of others that can do the job too - Rake, Gradle, Ant, etc - but they aren't really designed for it like the others are meant to be...

In my experience, many people have strong opinions about it, one way or another. Having an external preprocessor to add magic feels awkward, but it's well integrated and adds real value (dynamic invocation and some reflection). I see it as a practical solution, which is not necessarily beautiful, but allows me to ship on time. 

One thing I'm not particularly fond of is its preferred memory management model. The QObject tree that frees memory is nice and all, but I would feel better if I used smart pointers and RAII (I use the latter whenever possible).

Static method declarations can be used to create value typedefs from pointer-like template parameters.,33,8,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/1esisa/c11_am_i_stupid_for_not_knowing_this_was_possible/,"I was looking at a Linq-style library for C++ ([seen here](https://cpplinq.codeplex.com/SourceControl/latest#CppLinq/cpplinq.hpp)) and, while the author's use of whitespace made the code almost unreadable to me, I noticed something very interesting (which, admittedly, I immediately thought wouldn't link.) The edited code is:

    template&lt;typename TValueIterator&gt;
    struct from_range : base_range
    {
        static TValueIterator get_iterator();
        ...
        typedef decltype (*get_iterator()) raw_value_type;
        ...
    };

What is being demonstrated here is that the `get_iterator()` function is never defined, but the `decltype` keyword is used with it to create a value typedef of the template's sole parameter. Since `decltype` resolves at compile time and the `get_iterator()` function is never actually called, there are no linker errors.

My preferred language would be C++.
But of all the mobile platforms it seems only Microsoft is providing first class citizen treatment to C++ in WinRT. 
But Microsoft is kind of minor player in this market right now.

Android has [NDK] (http://developer.android.com/tools/sdk/ndk/index.html). But they (Google ) state clearly that
you are better off using Java in most situations.

Objetive-C? That will be completely new language and ecosystem. Not ruled out.

I have a question that's really been bothering me recently. I can program in c#, vb, java and of course c++.

The thing that I find very annoying is the lack of knowledge of what makes c++ used more than the other languages. From personal experience c++ is the hardest language from all other ones i know. Instead of having 1 file per class like in java or c# you need to have 2 files per class. Instead of just having a . for accessing members of objects you have a . and a -&gt;. I could list these forever. Yet in the end it turns out that almost everything is written in c++, OSes, applications, games, robots and even traffic lights.

I just need motivation to keep programming in c++. Please don't give me long lists of things I won't understand, use only the things a beginner will find useful and understand.

Thank You very much for your time,",,False,,t5_2qi27,False,,,True,t3_11sn3o,http://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/11sn3o/what_makes_c_so_good/,

A static type system is only really useful if it can provide a guarantee that a parameter or return value or member declared to be of a given type actually contains a meaningful value of that type at runtime. For many kinds of values there is no good default value (e.g. take an exception type with an error code, a file and a line of the point it is created, what are meaningful defaults for these members to use in a default constructor, or take a type describing a customer, what is a meaningful default name).

C++ culture on the other hand seems to have this weird idea that it is okay to demand a default constructor for all kinds of operations, even simple things like storage in a container.

1249099651.0,22,self.cpp,96j06,Ask.C++: Looking for references on coding for optimization on x86 architectures,25,3,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/96j06/askc_looking_for_references_on_coding_for/,"I have a project where I want to squeeze every bit of performance possible out of typical Intel multicore CPUs. Beyond simply using the Intel C++ compiler and Intel performance primitive libraries (which I *will* use), I'd like to read up on C/C++ programming techniques, idioms, tips and tricks for optimal code generation on 64 bit multicore x86 CPUs, especially in the areas of cache friendly code and how to make the best use of multiple cores.

I saw a number of books on Amazon:

* [Memory as a Programming Concept in C and C++](http://www.amazon.com/Memory-Programming-Concept-C/dp/0521520436)

* [Code Optimization: Effective Memory Usage](http://www.amazon.com/Code-Optimization-Effective-Memory-Usage/dp/1931769249)

* [The Memory System: You Can't Avoid It, You Can't Ignore It, You Can't Fake It](http://www.amazon.com/Memory-System-Synthesis-Lectures-Architecture/dp/159829587X)

I also spotted this lecture in the [programming subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/90o1g/cache_oblivious_algorithms/): 

* [MIT’s Introduction to Algorithms, Lectures 22 and 23: Cache Oblivious Algorithms](http://www.catonmat.net/blog/mit-introduction-to-algorithms-part-fourteen/)

But if we somewhat believe that C++ could be more elegant and efficient (at compilation), if there were no header files.

An approach is two-pass compilation: in the first pass, the compiler would scan the source files and create a map of exported functions and classes. In the second pass, it would actually compile the source (and ensuring that the ""external"" functions/classes are indeed defined somewhere).

IDEs can maintain a map of exported functions etc from all source files in the project. When linking binary libraries, the compiler can embed this information in the binary files itself.

I see two benefits: coding is simpler (no need to switch between header and source files, changing header files does not lead to unnecessary recompilation, definition of template classes in source files); and efficient compilation (for the same reasons).

This is just an idle musing on my part, but does the community think it to be worthwhile idea? Are there other features of C++ that absolutely need header files?",,False,,t5_2qi27,False,,,True,t3_1cvsof,http://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/1cvsof/headerless_c_a_good_idea/,

I thought you guys might find this interesting. I came up with a small solution for keyword arguments using operator suffixes and variadic templates. It's not the best solution by any means, but it is a fun and pure C++11 implementation that can be improved upon!

The solution allows you to write keyword arguments like:

    int main()
    {
        greet(""user""kw=""Justin"");
        greet();
    }

And use them like:

    void greet(const kwargs&amp; kw = kwargs())
    {
        int age = kw[""age""]; // default initialized values for copy semantics.
        int happiness = kw.get(""happiness"", 0);
        std::string name = kw.get(""user"", std::string(""somebody""));
        std::cout &lt;&lt; ""Hello, "" &lt;&lt; name &lt;&lt; ""!"" &lt;&lt; std::endl;
    }

Here is the actual code:

    #include &lt;string&gt;
    #include &lt;map&gt;
    #include &lt;memory&gt;
    #include &lt;iostream&gt;

    class kwarg {

        template &lt;typename T&gt;
        struct kwarg_proxy : kwarg_proxy_base {
            kwarg_proxy() = default;

I have done almost all my projects using C++ till now. The only other language I use regularly is BASH. I've never felt ""_I need to learn X language_"". However I've tried few others by small scripts or so.

My problem is I've not implemented some types of projects yet. For example I've never created a real big web application. But every time I think about some software type, I see it doable in C++. For example for the web application case I tell myself ""_I can do it in Wt and that library for DB and ..._"" AND I hate wasting CPU cycles.

Actually I've not enough motivation to go after learning and using other technologies. I hear much about how amazing Python is, what a good experience it is to create a web app using Ruby on Rails, etc. But I just don't have enough motivation. The problem is I feel something might be wrong about this. Others are not like this!

Now I want to create a real web app. It is not rational to try all those told-to-be-great technologies, although I've been reading about many of them for years. How should I decide? Or should I continue using my mother computer tongue, C++?

    const Rational operator*(const Rational&amp; r1, const Rational&amp; r2);

This is to avoid things like

    a * b = c;

He specifically mentions that this is helpful in the oh too common error

    if (a * b = c)
        // Do stuff

However, I was wondering. Should you return const from any function which returns by copying?

I wrote up an example:

    std::string test1() {
        return ""hello"";
    }

    int test2() {
        return 2;
    }

    int main() {
        test1() = ""jello""; // No error
        test2() = 3; // error!

        return 0;
    }

By default the primitive type does not allow this kind of assignment, but std::string does not have an issue with it. To make the behavior consistent should test1() be redefined as 

    const std::string test1() {
        return ""hello"";
    }

            }
        }
    }

    print_grid(grid, boardsize);

But this doesn't seem to work. I went to google to search how to implement a multidimensional array and I came upon many different suggentions, like using the *vector* class.

So what is the best way to implement an multidimentional grid/matrix/array?

I [read here](http://stackoverflow.com/a/497158) how I can make a shared library that exposes the implementation of a class.

And I can just compile with these:

    g++ -fPIC -shared myclass.cc -o myclass.so
    g++ class_user.cc -ldl -o class_user

The trouble are the create_object and destroy_object methods.
I mean, why can't I have my new and delete operators working ?
Or can I ? If so, how ?
 
Thanks,
An redditor

**UPDATE**: solved with the help of a colleague at work, the trick was to just -L. -lmyclass   and to forget all about extern wrappers and stuff. No -ldl needed. I needed a shared library, not dynamic, no plugins needed btw..

The jist of what I have is something like:


    IP4Address* IP4Address::GetFirstAddressInRange() {	
        ....
        IP4Address* _addr(new IP4Address(_addressString));
        _addr-&gt;netmask = this -&gt;netmask;
        return _addr;
    }



As you can see, it returns a raw pointer to a heap object of the same type, which then the programmer is responsible for deleting after they've finished with it. Would you encourage this? or would you return a smart pointer? 


The function's implementation in its entirety is at: 

https://github.com/thefossproject/LibIPvX/blob/master/ipv4address.cpp


It will assist me if you critique my code too - tear me in half if you will! :)

Kind of rudimentary, but it works.

But that got me thinking. If I want to go deeper and do c++ server developments more ""properly"", in what direction should I look for to get good scalability, reliability etc? I mean, what about authentication systems, sessions, cookies, httpd etc, what databases could be used well with c++ etc?

Normally you'd go with a language more suited for web dev (thinking java/php/c# etc), but since I've had so much more experience on c++, it could be better to just stick with it. On the other hand, it doesn't seem that c++ has that much support for web dev, or server applications dev in general. What's the actual situation?

Also, how does one scale a c++ server application? The same way you scale other applcations in java etc : by proper design consideration?

A little while ago I was playing around with the new concurrency stuff in the C++11 standard and wrote a few algorithms taking an iterator range, breaking it apart into *n* sub-ranges, where *n* is the number of threads available on the system and running the algorithm over each of these ranges (nothing new here). 

This worked nicely but unfortunately, it cluttered the code a little so I decided to abstract all of the concurrency work away so one just has to write what algorithm should be applied to the sub-ranges and how to combine these to get the final result. For example, for `std::count`, you would call `std::count` on the sub-ranges then `std::accumulate` on the results of the pieces, ie. map and reduce.

After this, I decided to implement a portions of `&lt;algorithm&gt;` and it turned out to be quite straightforward to accomplish :) Anyways, the code is [here](https://github.com/mrenaud92/cxx-utils/blob/master/concurrent/algorithm.hxx), let me know what you think.",,False,,t5_2qi27,False,,,True,t3_152i8b,http://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/152i8b/concurrent_version_of_embarrassingly_parallel/,

Been using this *stupid* trick for a while now and I'm enjoying it so much I thought I'd share.

Let's say we have this enum

    enum MyEnum
    {
        kOne,
        kSecond,
        kThird,
        kCount
    };

we would like to be able to write

    MyEnum value = MyEnum.kOne;

and hell, even have the value listed by Visual Assist or Intellisense (yeah right) when we type the name of the enum so we can choose from a list.

Well, it's as simple as wrapping it up in a namespace

    namespace MyEnum
    {
        enum e
        {
            kFirst,
            kSecond,
            kThird,
            kCount,
        };
    }

You must name the actual enum ""e"" because you may want to use this specific type like in:

    MyEnum::e value = MyEnum::kFirst;

So yeah... that is all. You get Visual Assist to list the possible values for a specific enum and visually in code you get a nice scope for it too.

Enjoy (?)

1. The convenient initialization of compile-time strings.
2. The ability to produce new compile-time strings resulting from operations on existing ones.

I've read some of the Scott Meyers books (Effective C++, More 	Effective C++, Effective STL). I'm planning to start reading a new book but I'm not able to pick one yet, so maybe you guys can help on this :

Here are the options :

-Professional C++ ( includes references to new standard, that's a plus for me)

-Exceptional C++

-More Exceptional C++

-Modern C++ Design

-C++ Template Metaprogramming

In the other hand, feel free to recommend something that is not in the list and you think it might be worth.

Recently I've decided to start work on development of solution, which would make it possible to use MinGW C++ compiler from MS Visual Studio. And I'm going to write several posts about the development ot this system.

Here is the announce: [MSBuild for MinGW (about the series)](http://cpp-sparkles.blogspot.com/2012/07/msbuild-for-mingw-about-series.html)

So I'm asking for several points:

* Is the idea of usage of MinGW from Visual Studio can be interested for anybody?
* Are the posts about its development may be interesting for anybody and worth posting here (or somewhere else)?
* As I'm not a native English speaker I cannot estimate the quality of my language, so, please, tell me if it is OK, not good or absolutely terrible.

EDIT:
