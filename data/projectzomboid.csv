The only possible way inside is through the staircase behind the house, out the bathroom window, and through the front door. The only way out is through the window in the front bedroom. I use the kitchen as storage, and the new addition to the house which I'm working on will be the new storage using crates. The house is entirely zombie proof, besides bugs which let them through some walls somehow, as you see from all the corpses (which were almost entirely from a single massive horde inside my house. Didn't even get hit once, that day.)

I just sort of randomly took screenshots from the very beginning through today and created an imgur gallery with 31 of the best ones.  My character's name is Tom Morrow, and he's a firefighter with the following traits:  Light Drinker, Quick Temper (Angry? Something like that) and Strong. 

It's been one hell of a fight, and I've also lost five days over two crashes.  I'm currently holed up in a warehouse after burning through almost two months of scavenged rations.  The nights are getting colder, I'm almost out of water, and the hordes are beginning to show up right at my doorstep.  If there's any interest, I'll try to do another gameplay video soon.  Sadly, my PC is crap and so is my internet connection, so I don't think streaming is an option for me.

Quick question, too:  does anyone know of any free alternatives to Windows Movie Maker that support 720p and above?  I think the video I made looks like crap, but I made it as awesome as I could.  :|

Edit:  As requested, [proof](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6FFnZB_42U&amp;feature=youtu.be).  Again, sorry about the terrible video quality.

Opened a bathroom door...BAM! Three zeds all up in my grill. Even though I was pretty sure they were gonna be in there, I actually jumped out of my chair with fright. No shit. Turned, bolted out the house, my heart was actually pounding and my sphincter was tight, had that nervous bubbly feeling in my gut...the whole spectrum of actual fear. Pretty impressive.

I managed to survive that encounter. Ran all the way to the warehouse, through I don't know how many hordes. And I survived. I felt like I had actually accomplished something.

A game hasn't gotten emotion out of me like that since the early DayZ days.

Here are some of the things that I enjoy and don't enjoy about the game.

Enjoy:

* The way the zombies react to the ambient noises.

 Distant gunshots and helicopters (what the hell is up with these guys?  Some douche in a helicopter flew above my safehouse for a whole day and nearly killed me with the 1000 zombies it brought with it) attract all kinds of zombies.

* How certain houses have alarm systems (although I don't really get how some houses don't have alarm systems but their sheds do).

* The diversity in the items and more recently the ability to hunt for your favorite colored pants.


Don't enjoy:

* The combat system.  I do like the range of weapons you can find, but with anything other than a sledgehammer or a baseball bat I feel like I'm not doing a whole lot of damage.

  Maybe it's because my guy sucks.

* The ability to get bored in a zombie apocalypse.  Yes, if you stand still for five hours I expect that you would get bored out of your gourd, but my guy is still bored when he's running around looting.

  Maybe my guy is a total badass, dunno.

What I'd like to see implemented:

* The ability to break parts of zombies so that they'd have to crawl, drag their leg, etc.

* The ability to use everything as a weapon

* More survivors/bandits

* More classes/traits when creating a character



Now, this is just my two cents.  It's okay if you think differently, I'd love to hear what you guys think!",,False,self,t5_2sdk8,False,,,True,t3_1f5n6k,http://www.reddit.com/r/projectzomboid/comments/1f5n6k/first_impressions_of_the_game_so_far/,

the graphics are MUCH different now, less how i like it and alot more zoomed out.

I tried 4 different saves, running around, finding a bat and some food, no axe, no way to build shelter and feeling like its just a ton of zombies and no way to live.

1. For help with carry weight, you can equip a bag as your secondary, which lowers the amount it shows in your main inventory.

2. You can force a window open, if the front door is not open that does not mean the house is off limits. Stand next to the window and press E, if it opens which it usually will after some time, hold E down to go through the window. Now this can set off a alarm, but its always a gamble.

3. Check the windows before entering a house if at all possible, saves some scary zombie moments, walking in prepared is your best bet.

4. You can loot the zombies as well, they can have nothing but clothing, up to saws, hammers, nails, weapons such as guns and axes rarely,and food as well. Most often apples for some reason.

5. If you need wood, you don't have to just chop down doors, trees can provide you with all the wood you need.

6. The best water to weight ratio is from the kettle and watering spray can i believe.

7. To cook recipes put all items in your main inventory and then left click the item for options.

8. When starting a game, a good method is to get a bit of food, a weapon then head straight for the big warehouse. Lots of weapons, farming supply's, and next to many houses and main town for looting.

On youtube a good person to watch for tips is the user eckyman. I learned a lot from him.

If you have any other questions feel free to ask.

It's the best I could find and easy to follow without getting lost though.  I tried to find a more direct route and got lost and eventually crashed the game by going outside of the map I think (which proves to be an irrecoverable crash by the way).  So keep in mind that you have a long way to go and you may hate me along the way.

###[Directions are in this album](http://imgur.com/a/efeA9)

The directions start from road at the NE corner of the [Gehennae map](http://i.imgur.com/bYYzAmG.png).  You can also start from the main highway at the NW corner of the map.  Just follow that highway North, and it will eventually turn East then meet up with the directions on picture 7.

The directions also include notes on how to find a few other things along the way

-A much closer farm with no well  
-Diner

Today's Mondoid developer update discusses the future of the new map and why the new Muldraugh is so different from the previous version.  Basically it sounds like the intended gameplay as the map progresses will be to get your bearings and some basic supplies in Muldraugh then start to move North towards West Point and eventually Louisville to find more resources (and danger).

But what really caught my eye was this:

&gt;and to the south is… some other interesting stuff. ;)

So I went and looked around South of Muldraught and saw [this](http://i.imgur.com/UGlkrwN.jpg).  A few cemeteries surrounding an army air field.  Yeah, that could certainly be interesting...

But then I went a little further south.  And I apologize now if this was obvious to those who have been following the development longer or perhaps those who manage to grasp the obvious since the game is set in Knox County but...

Just South of that is [Fort Knox](http://i.imgur.com/fAoETUq.png)!  In case anyone is unfamiliar with it, [Fort Knox](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Knox) contains a large portion of the United States' gold reserve and is famous for its [heavy security](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Bullion_Depository#Construction_and_security):

&gt;The facility is ringed with fences ... is protected by layers of physical security, alarms, video cameras, mine fields, barbed razor wire, electric fences, heavily armed guards, and the Army units based at Fort Knox, including unmarked Apache helicopter gunships of 8/229 Aviation based at Godman Army Airfield, the 16th Cavalry Regiment, the 19th Engineer Battalion, formerly training battalions of the United States Army Armor School, and the 3rd Brigade Combat Team of the 1st Infantry Division, totaling 30,000 soldiers, with associated tanks, armored personnel carriers, attack helicopters, and artillery.

I have been trying the game and its fun. Its exciting, and everything, we all know what I am talking about.

However, I can't exactly find any tutorials for anything. I have checked out wiki and I know the controls but thats it. What should I carry with me, should I just hole up in first house I see and gather supplies in closets all days? What if I want to move to next door? It'll take ages! How do I even launch co-op and is it compatible with all controllers out there? (I think I personally have F-510). Of course people learn what to do in due time but some people want to read it :P ~~What happened to the crafting system that was in the demo for example? How do I now make a pot of soup? :(~~ What is the easiest setup of character for the first-timers? ~~Can I skip the intro because I already know this is the story how I died?~~ Or maybe there should be a beginners thread each week (for example) where all the veterans gather up help newbies with their questions? Like megathread monday? Whats with the latest versions in the sidebar? Desura doesn't give me the latest? I am so confused! Do I install it, overwrite old shits or have different folders for every version? How about the saves? Do I get to use 'em in the new version? 

I would probably have millions of questions but I just really want to get out of work tomorrow, tell my friend that I just paid way too less money on such awesome game and have a try at co-op.

 it is an amazing zombie survival game being made by a small team. They are working hard on a game which seems to have very little hype. i would really love to help these guys anyway i can. That's why im making my attempt to help them a little bit. If even one person discovers this game by this post and buys it, i would have accomplished something. they also have a subreddit. This will probably get downvoted but hell at least i tried to help these guys.

I've just put my hands on the new build and for the moment my only thought is ""holy shit it's HARD !""

So I just had the most ridiculous death ever. It was my second game and I got a sweet, sweet spawn. In a gaz station where I found a shotgun and a lot of shells. First thing I do is tearing my shirt appart by accident... My character must have been through some shit to react like this when he's happy.

I left the building to try out my new toy on a local woman. She seems nice, likes me for my brain but I already said I'm in some Hulk state of mind, so I shot her without any regrets... for science !... *Click click* I didn't load the gun :/

But it's okay, I manage to shoot her after putting some shells in the thing and have to run for my life since people here want to get a closer look on my gun...

I run, run and run again and manage to find a house, break in without being noticed and begin to loot the place... Or try to. While trying to open a nightstand I shoot it instead... I'm not a clever man.

In a panic I try to go out by the window I came in but I can't do this because of a wardrobe blocking the view and because I'm in a panic and don't have many time to react. I run toward the door, ""if i manage to open it quickly, I can shoot the 2-3 zombies that must be behind it and shoot my way out of the place"", I said to myself since I'm obviously a disturbed person...

I opened the door and a shitload of zombies came in, preventing me to shoot by grabing me. They push me in a corner with two windows bursting into shards and releasing TWO MORE shitloads of zombies. 

And that's how I died, after 4 hours (ingame) and without accomplishing anything that wasn't completly stupid :D

I already love this new version ;)

So far this has gotten me to have multiple long term survivals. Plus the zombies aren't as abundant on the outskirts like they are in the center of the County, so they are mainly a nuisance. Once the water and electricity shut off, I have already looted a massive stockpile of non-perishable food and water so I have it in me to survive quite a while longer. Usually at this point I run around with my guns and have a kill-fest until I die because there isn't an option to farm, and I don't want to go to the farmhouse for the well anyways.

What do you other long term survivors do early, middle, and late game?

Edit: In the realm of perks, I usually take Graceful and Strong.

1368603315.0,11,self.projectzomboid,1eddea,Glitches with 2.9.07 Build,11,0,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/projectzomboid/comments/1eddea/glitches_with_2907_build/,"Where to start? Just on several games I have determined what some of the major errors of this build are. These may be specific to my computer/graphics card but who knows.

* Item 1. Cannot type in a title for a sandbox world. 

Curiously enough I can for a standard game, so the work around appears to be to type in the name in standard but don't actually make the world and then go into sandbox and the sandbox world should have this name at which point the world can be made for sandbox.

* Item 2. Storage boxes get corrupted if your character spends too much time apart from them. 

After some testing as long as you stay within the general area of the storage spaces they are fine and storage spaces you have yet to find are also likewise fine. If you use the warehouse as storage and decide to walk to the other side of the highway your stuff has a fair chance of not being there when you return. 

Also you can tell when this glitch is present because the storage containers appear corrupted, a fridge might be a closet or a chest might be shelf and so on.

2.1 Closets and some garbage bins do not have their own storage space when you try to open them and when you do manage to 'open' them the icon that should represent them as a closet doesn't exist and its as if you were looting the floor.

2.2 Vending machines can start prebugged. 

Vending machines on encounters have been known to appear as other containers containing loot that is generally found in those containers that probably make no sense to find in a vending machine. An example is paint cans or clothes. Although it is funny to wonder how the paint can got in the vending machine in the first place (or how you got it out??) its not really productive.

* Item 3. Alarms are seriously bugged.

3.1 When you save and reload in a house there is a fair chance of an alarm magically starting even though you are already in the house.

3.2 Public facilities like bathrooms without doors can have alarms when you step inside.

3.3 Alarms sometimes followed by a plane or helicopter sound effect cause the plane/helicopter sound effects to be stuck on loop for a random time. These sound loops can also happen without the alarm but they seem to frequently happen with alarms than without. They may be also related to sleeping as they happen when the character is asleep too.

3.4 (Possibly intended?) Alarms cause alarm chains.

Scenario: You set of an alarm, zombies head towards alarm. Zombies get stuck on houses along the way to the alarmed house. Zombies stuck on houses bump into either windows or doors, zombies try to break in on contact. Zombies break in and have a chance of setting off alarms. Outcome: From what I have seen if you stick around in an area hiding from zombies you can have somewhere around 4-8 alarms go off before the alarm chain stops.

3.5 Alarms don't always stop when the power is off.

3.6 Unlocked houses can have the alarms set, even with zombies in the house that should have set the alarm off.

3.7 Houses you have already found to not have alarms can later have alarms.

* Item 4. (Possibly intended?) You can enter through windows with a cupboard or table behind them. 

The consequences of this though are that select houses with these obstructed windows can cause the player to get trapped in the cupboard unable to move. Restarting will not solve this and it is 100% fatal in my experience.

* Item 5. Some houses leave the player unable to navigate through them. 

This can because the hallway is slightly too small, or a table is stopping someone from entering a bathroom. 

* Item 6. Axes are game crashing.

After some experimenting axes do not always crash but they seem to do so fairly often.

* Item 7. Inventory can get surgically attached to mouse when attempting to move it.

What I mean by this is that if you try to drag the inventory or other windows sometimes the mouse wont let them go, after spamming the mouse and every keyboard button possible (This gets me killed fairly often) I am sometimes able to dislodge with right clicks but it is trial and error. Pressing esc or pausing the game does not solve this and you will keep dragging the offending window regardless. The easiest solution is a full game restart.

* Item 8. Moving too many items from the inventory to containers (Cabinets, closets, crates and every other container you can think of!) or vice versa will cause the inventory and container items to freeze.

Once frozen they cannot be moved anywhere, cannot be eaten or equipped and nothing (I have found) can be done to fix this besides a restart. Happens especially often with stacks of items over 50 like bullets or nails.

* Item 9. Combat skills are bugged.

Using various classes I have discovered that I cannot level up my combat skills. I played as a carpenter and had 600 zombies killed, roughly 100 with melee weapons and 500 with shotgun. No experience in any combat skills. ( I raided the whole highway for shotgun shells when the water ran out and I was sure to die of thirst and went on a killing spree)

* Item 10. Naked zombies.

Zombies that you kill will still be there when you find them later but without their clothes. This can happen if you reach an unknown distance away from the zombies or if you save and reload. 

* Item 11. (Probably just not implemented) Certain weapons do not have their own appearance when equipped by your character.

Some of these weapons include the rolling pin that looks like a bat when equipped or the golf club which looks like a crowbar when equipped.

* Item 12. (Possibly intended?) Some doors cannot be opened and the player can walk through them, the same is true for zombies.

Usually bathroom doors found in diners, gas stations or convenience stores, if it is intended though there is the issue that your character cannot detect zombies behind these doors besides the panic indicator but zombies are perfectly able to see the player through them.

12.1 In one gas station with the not solid bathroom doors it is possible to walk through the wall like the bathroom door to the outside. Zombies can also do this.

* Item 13. Zombies sometimes spawn in already looted houses.

One thing I have noticed is that house that I loot and later revisit for sleeping can have zombies in them with no source of entry. These houses I have usually sheeted all the windows and was careful to make sure all doors were still shut when I left and entered.

* Item 14. Backpacks, bags and other containers work like nesting dolls.

This means you can put a completely full backpack into another bag and put that bag into another bag and that bag into another bag. Each bags weight reduction seem to decrease the weight of the original bag. Besides the time consumed to get the first bag out of the other bags there seems to be no problem in retrieving the items.

Edit --------&gt; 
     
* Item 15. Clothing does not spawn with you

Your character does not always spawn clothing when you start a new game, your character appears to be wearing clothes but upon further investigation there is no clothing in your inventory and due to this you are subject to statuses like 'feeling chilly'

I just started playing a few days ago and I'm on my 4th attempt at survival now. I've lasted way longer than my previous lives and I've almost hit 1 month, 7 days. I just had a few questions that I was hoping could be answered. I can't seem to find any detailed information about gameplay that isn't from 2011.

1. Are the books broken? I've read so many carpentry books yet nothing has happened.

2. In reference to above, is there any way to get carpentry up faster? I've build so many wooden walls and barricades and my skill isn't even level 2 yet. I have excessive supply stocks and need to start making crates + better walls to expand my fort.

3. Water and power are still on for me. How long can I expect them to hold out?

4. My perishables don't seem to be going off in the fridge, despite multiple sources telling me it should have by now.

5. What the bollocks is the screwdriver for?

6. Is there any way to remove fences and/or zombie corpses? (both are blocking my plans for expansion)

7. Does loot respawn? I can't seem to find any information on this, but I'm playing survival and I swear I've been through the same groups of houses more than once with new loot (perhaps a few weeks between).

That being said, we now have a new game mode, new soundtrack, gardening, and still no working split-screen.

some of the issues I had run into before are in fact fixed, but there is still this huge issue where my second player who joins in and is randomly generated will become stuck very quickly. This seems to happen when climbing through windows or over fences, and once stuck, they cannot move. they can open/close inventory, and use 'X' to interact with stuff to some extent, but that's about it. They then have to drop all their stuff so I can pick it up, then restart the game, and have a new shitty character randomly generated.

I'm fairly new to PZ but I like it even though I'm really no fan of zombies, I guess I'm attracted to the general melancholy of the game where you dont really have much of a chance and things are bad getting worse etc. Anyway, Im now on my first successful playthrough, where the construction worker (gotta love that thick skin) Roy Walker has survived for over a month. I have three safe-houses stored up with water and food, I've got 3 axes, 3 hammers, lots of skills leveles up (I think 7-8 gold squares), built som stuff, I got a tent-kit for going to the western farm. Basiaclly, I'm as safe as you can be in PZ. Things are a bit bugged though, I had to re-do some things after I crashed and when I finally found a new baseball bat to add some nails to (I've gone through a couple, zombiekills are at 130) it disappeard from my storage box rendering my bat-search expedition a waste of time. This annoyed me somewhat, and I think I wont do another playthrough until the game is updated, since farming is disabled there's no point in taking the next step and moving out to the farm.

I've been very patient so far but my question is: Should I take my shotgun and 60+ shells and go mad? If I do, is it possible to survive that?

The hordes are growing closer to my warehouse by the day and things are thus not sustainable if I cant start a farming op. I suppose it's naive to think I can beat the general number of zombies down?

**Has anyone survived a killing spree like that?**

Then I died while fighting two zombies.  I knocked one down but stayed too close to him while hitting the other one.  The first one got back up and for some reason I couldn't push him away before he bit me.  But knowing I had a 96% chance to die let me have some fun by going back to my ammo stockpile and going through about 74 shotgun shells and 100 9mm round before I succumbed.


##Some things I wish I'd known at first:

-Your best survival tool is patience and flexibility.  Stay out of danger by taking the long way around if you have to and changing your route and destination based off of zombie movement.  
-Don't be too afraid of staying out past dark or when you are tired, it's not so bad as long as you are being careful and avoid taking fights you aren't ready for.  
-Before entering a building look in as many windows as possible to check for zombies.  If there aren't any zombies nearby outside give a shout once you're in then listen for any zombies in interior rooms who hear you and start banging against doors.  
-You can loot dead zombies, and sometimes they have some useful things.  
-Instead of clicking to open/pass through windows use 'e'.  Tap it to open/close a window and hold it down to climb through.  
-Although I think the music is pretty well done I eventually turned it off ('m') so that I could listen better to in-game sounds.  
-Axe durability seems to fall surprisingly fast from fighting zombies but not from chopping trees.  
-Food is pretty unimportant in this build and the bonuses you get from staying fed don't last long enough to be worth constantly worrying about it imo.  My character barely ate more food than I did while playing.  
-Use alarms to your advantage.  Instead of panicking when an alarm goes off take it as an opportunity to know where almost all zombies in the area will be headed and explore the areas they just deserted.  
-Level up lightfooted and sneaking skills early (by sneaking back and forth near a big horde to get loads of xp).  

##A couple of questions I had:

-Does boarding up windows/doors work in this build?  I couldn't figure out how to do it.  
-How do you get to the farm from town?  I found it once while trying to find the town with a character who was very very lost.

A lot of times though I'll open an upstairs door or something and the zombies that were in that room (Not making any sounds) don't appear until I actually enter the room. Usually this gives me a scratch or bite. Is this how it's supposed to be?

B) I don't know if this is true, but a pattern that I might have noticed is that when entering a house that has zombies in it, I usually find a good item as opposed to empty houses. Maybe this is just chance, but I'm not sure. Maybe it might be a risk/reward kind of factor..?

I guess? the old build when indiestone got their laptops stolen. After that I kind of drifted and never really followed and today I decided to take the plunge and buy it on Desura. However I'm a little lost about a couple of things in this game and my efforts to find information have been fruitless. Seems like you need to be in the loop for this game for a while to know what's going on. So I have a couple of questions

So I remember there being a sort of story/tutorial in the old version but in this version all I get is the sandbox, survival and last stand modes and creates a new character everytime. Did the tutorial dissappear? was it only in the old version? is there a new one?

Another question is I see a lot of people talking about NPCs; did they took out all NPCs like bandits and other survivors? What was the reason to do it? I guess if they took out the NPCs, out goes the old tutorial right? So in the current build (Desura Build 10 i guess) is just you and the zombies right?

Last question. I see in the forums about the forum test builds which I guess they are buggy versions of the future builds; however I see build 11, 12, 13 and 14 in the forum. So does that mean they have 4 test builds going on at the same time? and then they start putting the lowest one as stable and put up a new ""Build 15"" on the forums?

This seems like a very cool game and it's come a long way but I seem to be completely lost whenever I start, although I saw a couple of posts here explaining several tips for survival.

 In short, to the north is Louisville, A nice and large city which they plan on including some of, Hopefully most. 

To the east and west, Forestland. 

But to the south is where it gets ***really*** interesting.

For one, there is three (3) cemetery's just chilling.

An airforce base.

A little south-east of that, Get this *Fort Knox* as in *the* fort knox.

You see, In my mind, I can see the devs making a zombie Hoard scripted into the highway just south of Muldraugh into the air force base/fort knox making it a challenge to get to fort knox and inhabit it. The inclusion of fort knox would be an amazing step due to the fact that it would be almost impossible to break into without the entire map's worth of zombies walking in and setting up shop. 

The three cemetery's would make it nice and hard to get close to the fort nor the Air Force base and that would make getting into Fort knox a nice achievement, if they plan on adding achievements into the game. 

&gt;""Got into Fort Knox. You Lucky Bastard""

Anyways, That's my two cents as well as what I'd like to see in the game, T'would be nice to break into the un-break-into-able-place.

EDIT:Make that 5 cemetery's... Fort knox will be fun! :P

EDIT2: I apologise as I just found out that someone just beforehand had posted the information about Fort Knox and what not, Sorry about that.

that said, there seems to be an increasing number of zombies every itteration i've been walking.

Does this road actually LEAD somewhere. or is it just endlessly looping?

I don't have anyone to share the excitement of this game with yet as I'm the first in my circle of friends to play this. Failed miserably the first two times I played so I read up on the controls and mechanics on the wiki and can't stop thinking about the game now! Here's what's happened so far in my 3rd attempt at PZ.

[My spawn and the area I spent my first week:](http://i.imgur.com/BnfAttf.png)
My character started in the building with the silver arrow. In the first 2 days I managed to get to the convenience store and back to the safe house (looting houses along the way). Saw Cortman Medical Center was next door which led me to slowly working up the nerve to confront my first zombie. It was very satisfying leading them up behind the fence of the convenience store to smash their brains one-by-one (after spending the first two games trying to run to a house I could get into and being chased by hordes, oh man, how things change when you know how to sneak and how to open windows).

It took a day to clear the Zombs by the medical center, but I figure the supplies would make it worth while. I snuck through a window... no alarm. Phew. Threw up some sheets on all of the windows after clearing the first level. Now to climb the stairs. I'm sure you all are familiar with the transition between levels of buildings - well I almost had a heart attack when the top level revealed 2 zombies waiting for me. I ran downstairs like a bitch and waited for them to chase me - they didn't. Up I went. The damn transitions made it nerve wracking and on top of that, there were only like two squares of floor at the top of the stairs and a closed door. I killed the 1st zomb without even seeing it (was swinging like a mad man at the ""stair top"" area while still in the black limbo). Snagged the medical supplies and headed home victorious.

The next morning I opened the door to my safe house only to find a massive horde hanging around outside. Guess it's time to move on. I spent most of the day sorting through my inventory layout, storage in the house to gather all the supplies I deemed worthy of a move. I had to sneak out the back window and leave my first ""home"" behind - Night 6 was already almost upon me when I left and I decided to spend it in the house just to the left of the safe home. It would do for now, but I've got bigger goals of exploration up my sleeve, and I'm looking forward to the day I stumble upon my first axe!!!

Day 7 led me to the church - I was hoping to find something of interest inside, but when I got there and looked through the windows all I could see was blood smeared all over the walls. Holy hell, I've never known a game to freak me out as much as seeing that did - as in I've never felt so invested in my character and his safety. So rather than take my chances in a blood-bathed church I took refuge in the little shack next to the church for the night 7. 

That's the extent of my journey so far with this character! Who knows where the next few days will lead. I've heard of a farm to the north that I may try to make it to before summer - I started in March. But first the curious explorer in me wants to raid the warehouses and police station west of my current location.

Spying a nice two story house with no zombies at its perimeter, I approach and enter its front door. Unlocked. Fortune smiles upon me. A quick scout of the lower level reveals no zombies, and I ascend the stairway, baseball bat in hand.

The children's bedroom is empty. I grab a baseball bat from the cupboard. Always good to have a spare. I'm in the master bedroom now. Some painkillers in their bedside table, now tucked away in my duffel bag. The ensuite bathroom. I think nothing of it as I open the door. It's the last room and my guard is down.

I catch the first zombie in the temple with my bat as he lunges out to greet me. He is rebuffed as the second takes his place and is suddenly upon me. Quick reflexes allow me to shove him back, and as he trips and falls - the third zombie grasps at me. As I can turn to run I hear the terrible ripping sound. The end game.

But I am away, out into the corridor. I turn around, bat in hand to meet the fastest of them. A true strike lands and its brain is splattered over the wall.

T'was the dawn of a brand new day in suburbia. As Craig arose from his sheets, he could not help but notice the stench of evil (and mainly rotten flesh). Wondering if the fridge had somehow broken down during night time and let his impressive steak collection go rotten, Craig got ready for the short day that awaited him.

 After ""accidentally"" losing his shirt, trying to put it back on only to arrive to the philosophical conclusion that shirts are overrated and hence an obstacle in his quest of utmost importance, he fumbled around the room, thinking at first his closet might be a door. Sadly enough, after opening it, he quickly realized two things: Narnia did not lie within, and he needed a cup of coffee. After smashing the walls with his bare fists, he finally punched the door open and headed to the kitchen.

To his dismay, his steak collection was gone, along with his coffee.

Craig was infuriated by the situation. As a civil engineer, his coffee was the only reason his projects would usually finish a mere two years after the estimated time. And he had also lost his steak collection, something he had inherited from his father, who inherited it from his grandfather. The steaks were vintage - it would be impossible to get them back, and in his mind Craig already plotted a large scale lawsuit against the daring soul who dared to take it away from him. He took the lonely radish in the fridge, and headed out with a bat in his hand and murder in his mind.

He followed the stench of rotten flesh, certain at the end of the trail would lie the culprit. Instead, he fount a zombie.

Craig, unlike many TV stars, knew exactly what a zombie was and how to get rid of one. He had been practicing for the last 14 years, playing videogames such a zombie ate my neighbors, medieval and left 4 dead. However, the transition from a monitor to a fullsized drooling individual was a shock. In fact, he was so shocked he forgot how to use his arms, and had to run around for a bit in a memory jog of sorts. By the time his muscle memory kicked in and smashed the zombie's skull to a oozy pulp, he has suffered some minor damage.

Nothing much, he thought. A quick sleep in a neighbor's bed will fix me up real good.

After raiding the kitchen for the essentials, such as frying pans and pots, Craig secured the house, closed the doors and had a quick nap. Little did he know that by the time his little nap was over, it was 11pm and dark as the bottom of the ocean outside. In spite of his tries, he simply could not go back to sleep after sleeping for what seemed to be 12 hours.

Craig decided that it was time for some nigh time mischief. If a zombie invasion had indeed kicked in, he was going to use the cover of night to have a look around and loot some of his least favorite neighbors.

Little did he know walking around in a neighborhood alien to him in the dark following vague lights and shadows would be part one of his mistake. After rummaging through some trashcans and walking into several walls, he finally fount a house with light, noticing not too far away was a zombie wandering aimlessly.

Of course that before entering the house, he just had to yell that he was about to do just that. Some might say he was trying to open the door, but due to a brain malfunction he ended up yelling on top of his lungs. Others might claim this is what killed him.

They'd be wrong.

Make a new text file in your PZ folder with the following content

    set path=%path%;%ProgramFiles%\Java\jre6\bin;%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Java\jre6\bin;
    java -Djava.library.path=./ -Dsun.java2d.noddraw=true -Dsun.awt.noerasebackground=true -Dsun.java2d.d3d=false -Dsun.java2d.opengl=false -Dsun.java2d.pmoffscreen=false -Dhttp.proxyHost=&lt;proxy-server-here&gt; -Dhttp.proxyPort=8080 -cp lwjgl.jar;./ zombie.FrameLoader

Replace the &lt;proxy-server-here&gt; with your proxy server and maybe replace the '8080' with your proxy's port (most likely not nessesary).
Then save it as ProjectZomboidProxy.bat and you are ready to go!

For people who are familiar with batch files and the Java programming language: I hope it's easy to see that I just added two args to the `java` call. The rest is the same as in the original batch file. If you are a Dev for PZ maybe you could add a small config to the login dialogue, which simply changes the batch file accordingly.

What would you do stuck in a house not really sure how to make something that you currently desperately need?


Excluding googling for now, twitter is a second best bet :) The side effect of a lot of people posting weird tweets with a specific tag (like #pz or something) - more popularity for the project we all like to support.


I listened to a few interviews with the developers and they all stated on several occasions that community interaction (like youtube videos, wiki etc) was something they hoped to achieve.

Also, what's the difference between Survival Mode and Sandbox Mode, other than the setting changes? I heard somewhere that Survival is one world, and each play through keeps the changes. Meaning if you board up and barricade a house, and die, then your next play through you can potentially find the barricaded house?

Finally, I spent a lot of time barricading and setting up one house on a play through. All the windows were boarded up and curtained, and I was ready to craft so I was looting materials from other places. I went pretty far away from my house, and when I returned with some planks, it got reset and all my work was gone. Has this happened to anyone else?

Info: Up until just now I was playing in 32x because I didn't know how to get 64x working. I've only done one short life so far on 64x, but I don't know if the 32x was even causing problems to begin with. I'm running it in Windows 8 too, not sure if that effects anything either.

For information on that, look it up yourself. I'm here to discuss the future beyond build RC 3. Imagine this: You and your team of survivors have managed to establish a permanent safe-house in a farmhouse deep within the forest. All of a suddenly, your team must make a scavenging missions into the heart of the city, the only place nearly un-touched by survivors. Heavy resistance and supplies are almost guaranteed. As your team arrives, armed to the teeth with shotguns and machine guns, you look for the large supermarket. Upon finding it, you and your team enter quickly with guns at the ready. It seems it is your lucky day, due to zombie migration the zombies have moved on and you're free to take what you want. You open the door to the kitchen to see, to your surprise, more survivors. Shocked, they open fire, which leads to a block-wide firefight for your lives. There is no clear winner but many casualties when the zombies, having heard the shots, enter the fray. You abandon the mission and return with no food but instead less men. It is a bad day...

Also, imagine this: Your team has finally made it past the zombie horde between them and the rest of the survivors. As you sprint to the house you hear an explosive sound behind you. You turn around to see an armed military team killing all the zombies with ease and full-auto weapons. All of a sudden, a shot hits your companion directly in the chest and you realize that the military is shooting only things that move. Un-sure if you should fire back or run, mass confusion leads to the destruction of your team and alot of family-less survivors in the safe-house.

Damage: Low~Medium (Should be weaker than Pistol)

Ammunition: Nails

Noise Level When Fired: Low (Making this a crude ""silenced"" weapon)

Misc: Can also be used in place of a Hammer in all crafting recipes with the exception being for Watermelon Chunks (that should require a blunt weapon). Can also be used for boarding up windows/doors. However, there is no range bonus as you still have to hold the board in place to nail.

I also think that the longer I play on each save, or the more characters I create on it, the more likely it is that it crashes. After each crash, it creates a new save with the added suffix ""_crash"", but if I try to play on that, the game dies again.

It seems to happen mainly when I'm fighting zombies.

I got the rather wonderful Project Zomboid last night. Played on PC, awesome. Even did a little live stream for friends to tempt them in to getting it, which they have.

But, for a few reasons, mainly having a young daughter, my PC time is limited. Though, I can use my laptop nearly all day every day. So, I was hoping that Zomboid would work on my laptop. It didn't strike me as the most visually taxing of titles and one of the reasons I got it. Yes I know, what follows is my own fault.

I loaded on to my laptop this morning and I get through the menus, load up and it crashes every time. I get a bubble pop up saying that there has been an error with my Windows XP display drivers and they have been recovered.

I am assuming my laptop doesn't have the legs graphically to run it, which I am fair gutted about but never mind. Anyone know of anything I can do?  Cheers!

I was wondering if anyone knows what this error means and how to fix it. I must also add that even though I receive this error whenever I try to run it off Desura, I can easily workaround this problem by running the exe file in my directory.

I have spent some time on the blog reading about the game and watched some gameplay videos, and I just downloaded the demo last night.  I just had some questions about the version that is out now and future patches.

- Is there any way to change the keybindings?  I've just played the demo and really don't care for the 'hold CTRL' to attack but I couldn't find any way to set my own controls.  In the paid version can you change them or play the game with a gamepad?  (I'm also not a PC gamer by any means, the only games I've played are Portal, Fallout, and The Longest Journey)

- When does the next update come out?  I saw 'early 2013' mentioned in a couple of different places but is there anything more definite?  Are the system requirements going to change with future updates?  I have a really shitty laptop (can't even run Minecraft), so I don't want to purchase the game if I can't run it anyway.

- Should I wait for the next update before buying?  A lot of people seem to be excited about the next update to the game, so should I just wait and get the game when it comes out, or is it worth getting as it is now?

- Will the price change?  One of the reasons I was debating getting the game now, before the update.  Will the price be going up after future updates?  Conversely, will the game go on sale any time?  (I know $7 isn't much, but if it is going on sale soon I also don't mind saving $)

- Is there somewhere I can read about all the changes that will be in the next update?  Like I said, I've read through the blog about farming, the new map size, etc; but I was just wondering if there's a single list somewhere detailing all the changes to come.

- If I buy the game now, do I own it for good?  Or will I have to eventually purchase a full retail version on Steam?

Those are the main questions I have I guess, thanks for any replies!

If anyone has any tips or strategies for the current or upcoming builds of the game than I'd be happy to hear those too!  Like I said, I'm a newbie to the game.

Started by making my way to the Apartment which is sometimes locked so finding an axe to cut it down is useful but hopefully it just unlocked. I check the house to the left for sheets to cover up all windows on the first floor. Then I run next door and empty that grocery store out. I would suggest staying on the third floor so you can watch for your front door being damaged by any zombies. I store all the food in one cabinet (Chips, soda, and candy), All food that can decay is stored in the fridge (Chicken, Fish, Steak, Carrots, Apples, and Bread) and also eat this before anything else.
Once you have enough supplies for a week (which you already should have) Check all 7 floors for all items. Usually you will find everything you need cooking, healing, and weapon wise. Only thing missing... A hammer. I usually am able to run down to the tool store and grab one. While I am there I go into the little storage hut filled with crates next door to it and usually there is a decent amount of wood. Get what ya need get back to the apt and be sure no zombie are around to see you go in. Never have zombies following you when you go in. At this point what you can do is start getting all the pills and putting them into one cabinet putting your wood, nails, hammers, weapons, gas cans, and lighters.
I like to keep the pot, can opener, and soup separate. Remember never cook on the floor your staying in. Its okay for floors above and below you to light on fire. This is where the game gets kind of boring so I like to have a movie playing while I chill and go through the apartment and start knocking doors down on floor your not using. So bathroom and bedroom doors on floor 1 and 2 and 4-6. They drop wood and you will most likely find a axe in the building somewhere which is much better to use then a bat or hammer. Once all that is done be sure to store all the wood and everything on the floor you are staying and prepare to go scavenging for food the next day. Only leave at 7am when the light is out. Carry on you a hammer, shotgun (If you have one), axe, shotgun shells, a plank(to board up your place as soon as your done), and 4 bags of chips or something of the sort. Suggest going to the corner store or hitting the restaurant which may be tough to get to depending on how quick the horde is spawning in your game or where the horde is.
Only go out in the day time which starts a 7am. When leaving always close your door. If somehow a horde does find there way to your front door my final days plan is to create all the barricades I can leaving maybe 10 planks left for just in case I survive the upcoming onslaught. You barricade the staircases as much as possible and live out your days until you are low on food (in which case you gotta break down your barricades and face the music) or the zombies horde breaks down all of your barricades and its fighting time. I am tryna have a little high score contest to see who can survive the longest. Post screenshots and post them here. My longest is a month and 10 days. You can do it in any mode you like.

1) One starting location.
Starting in the same exact spot every single time, and having to run to the same exact shed to find wood, same exact house to get my soup, etc makes the game extremely monotonous. It's easy to get bored/frustrated after dying a couple times and to just shut the game off. Not to compare, but I really love how Minecraft spawns you in a randomly generated world every single time you start a new game. 

2) The fact that you WILL die. 
I know it seems like a great idea and very unique, and it is, but there are some reasons why I really feel that it's going to bring the game down. No matter how good you are, the game will eventually make it impossible for you to survive. Why is this? Why is there not the potential for you to band together with your fellow survivors and continue to survive?

Since then I have been too busy to play many games and only just came back.

But this newest update that has changed the map, changed the sprites and added a whole bunch of other stuff - seems to have made the whole game easier.

Mainly because you barely have to eat anymore and weapons just don't seem to break. Plus considering you start in an abandoned house with a baseball bat every time finding a decent weapon isn't even a challenge anymore

I last on average 10 days before I get bored, eventually I will get bored and decide to just take down a horde.

Admittedly the Zeds do seem harder to kill now - or at least random, I've killed some in a single strike and others at around a dozen. I notice people find the alarms difficult to get around, but the zeds are pretty slow as long as you get in, get food and get out quick, the alarms actually take the zombies away from your initial base.

Finally the moodlets don't seem to effect anything, except from hunger which will eventually kill you. Like tired and exhausted, I could still run and skip around zeds with ease as far as I knew thirst didn't do anything and boredom had no down effects either.

I know I might be playing the game ""wrong"" but back in the beginning I would try and find the most secluded building, make it my base and then get supplies and wait it out, until the zeds found me and then stay protected. Now all I have to do is stay put in the house I'm in, trigger the occasional alarm and gather food.

**TL;DR** the updates seem to have made the game easier, to the point where I have to give myself challenges to actually die and moodlets don't seem to be detrimental to anything or at least to a noticeable amount",,False,self,t5_2sdk8,False,,,True,t3_1fihll,http://www.reddit.com/r/projectzomboid/comments/1fihll/does_anyone_else_find_this_game_easier_since_the/,

We'd just like the clarify the plan in terms of how we'll be releasing the update.

Firstly, the version that we'll be releasing initially (dubbed RC2.9) is essentially RC3 except without the NPC stuff in it.

We'll release to the community forums and update it until we fix the Intel bug
We'll update Desura at that point
We'll work on Kate and Baldspot getting that done, because that will aid to finishing the meta-game and of course get the tutorial back in, as well as them fitting into the meta-game
Then we'll go on Steam as soon as they are reimplemented and NPCs are back in

As a layman, it has almost been a year since the last update. A *year*. Finally it's coming out soon, (which is awesome). But at the same time, they have run donations and charity runs, and added info for that as a Mondoid post instead of information about the game. Which, as you might remember, flopped. Instead of being excited for Mondoid, it has become so repetitive it hurts. Here is the formula, select 2! (or three, if it was a slow development day).

[] Ringod's new youtube video!

[] SUPER QUIRKY PARAGRAPH WITH A LOT OF HOPE

[] Serious paragraph with the facts. There is only one. It's not out yet.

[] MORE HOPE

[] Whoops we fucked up.

[] WE'RE SUPER CLOSE NOW.

[] We were wrong.

[] Reasons why we fucked up.

[] Deep apology and promises for the future. 

[] OH GOD SPLOOGE NEW ANIMATIONS

[] RingodRingodRingodRingodRingodRingodRingodRingodRingodRingod

[] MORE HOPE

[] Gameplay showcasing... farming?

[] Info as to why the charity run thing flopped.

[] HOPE.

Its fairly annoying when you get a simple groin scratch, try to bandage it and for some reason the option is not there. So I eventually died due to a simple scratch that kept bleeding. *SIGH* Another thing I noticed was that I would get cold while sleeping in beds even though it was July... Not sure what that was about. Obviously this game is in alpha so its not meant to be perfect, but these glitches are none the less annoying. What's even more annoying is getting the dramatic intro even if you're just loading a save, how hard would it be to implement a loading screen? I am, however, satisfied with the combat. It's very frantic and never boring (at least not so far). Your character does seem to get tired very quickly... Is stress and exertion what cause this? I also learned pretty fast that claustrophobia is NOT worth the extra 4 points... I do have a few questions, though. How do unlocked boxes from exp affect that certain trait? Do you get better at blunt? More damage or less exertion when swinging? Also, where's the best place to find axes? And finally, is it possible to loot dead zombies? On the wiki it alluded to it being possible but I can't seem to do it myself. If the wiki was a bit more helpful, I really wouldn't have to ask these questions, but the wiki is very lacking...

**Back with that release the game had atmosphere;**

* Original and very good moody dark music.
* Dark story that was unfortunately unfinished but I was hooked immediately and wanted more.

I was satisfied with my purchase then but at the same time disappointed because the story didn't go as far as it should have. So with not much to do other than challenging myself with seeing how far I could get I stopped playing the game and decided to wait a while and let it develop some.

Today I picked the game up again and downloaded 0.2.0r RC2.5 with expectations that in almost the year that I last played it some progress had been made.

Guess what? No really meaningful progress has been made. In fact, as the title of this post says **the game has devolved.**

How has PZ devolved over the last year? I'll tell you.

* The music for the game has been completely ripped out. I couldn't find a reason for this on the forums other than vague bullshit. 
* Story mode was taken out for some reason or another. All that's left is a sandbox mode. A sandbox mode that was available in 0.1.5d.
* With story mode ripped out, so were quests. From what I understand no new ones were added anyway.
* The game is now infested with a ton of bugs. Using a stove or a microwave is now dodgy as you got to click a few times to get the On/Off text to be fully visible and clickable.
* The game takes A LOT longer to load now. It's not my PC either, as I ran both versions under it. And with no meaningful updates having been made... Well, there's no excuse for it.

The summary of all this is the game I had bought a year ago and hoped that would progress some over the course of a year is now but a mere shell of its formerself. And I'm not sure if it's going to get any better for this game. All I see are promises and excuses. With the train wreck that is the past year of updates for this game in mind, I'm not counting on it.
