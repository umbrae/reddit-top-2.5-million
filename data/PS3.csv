TL;DR: Sign out of the PSN when you're downloading a large file to continue playing games without making the download begin pending.

Since Kotaku failed miserably, I'm going to tell you about the PS3 launch",468,119,100,http://www.reddit.com/r/PS3/comments/1gpmb1/there_needs_to_be_accountability_since_kotaku/,"Friggin' Kotaku. How such a popular site manages to constantly screw up time and time again, when a real answer is just a Google search away.. it boggles the mind.

Just a few days ago, this link was making the rounds and was pretty popular http://www.reddit.com/r/PS3/comments/1gg9np/the_ps3_had_12_games_at_launch_heres_what_they/

It wasn't even really an article, just a few words and some ugly pictures in 360p resolution. He should have just linked to Gamespot's PS3 launch site: http://www.gamespot.com/events/ps3launch/games.html?sort=release

How such a crappy piece gets so popular is incredibly frustrating, because it just showcases laziness. Though it is Kotaku so this is nothing new.

The reason it's so crappy is because the PS3 didn't have 12 launch games, it had 14 (or 16 if you include the 2 PSN downloadable games; Blast Factor and Cash Guns Chaos). The Kraptaku piece mentions Blazing Angels: Squadrons of WWIi which was in fact DELAYED and didn't make launch. It was released a month later in December along with a couple other missed launch games such as Fight Night Round 3 and Full Auto 2: Battlelines. 

The Kotaku piece also fails to mention that Need for Speed: Carbon was a launch title, in addition to two more Sony games; Untold Legends: Dark Kingdom and NBA '07, the latter of which was only one of 3 launch titles to support native 1080p (the other two were Marvel: Ultimate Alliance and Ridge Racer 7, although Marvel had framerate issues when running in 1080p, while the other 2 were 60fps).

Some more fun facts: NBA 2K7 and NHL 2K7 were the first games to support 7 controllers simultaneously. Not even Sony's own NBA 07 supported this, nor did NBA 08 or NBA 09, which was the last Sony basketball title.

Also the very first PSN game was Blast Factor, which ran at 1080p and was developed by Bluepoint Games who did the great HD ports for the God of War Collection and the Ico &amp; SotC Collection. He didn't have to go into detail about the slow web browser based PS Store, but a little mention would have been nice. To look back and remember the slow PS Store without background downloading and then see how The Last of Us looks and can be played while 50% done downloading just shows how far the PS3 has truly come.

The other PSN launch game was Cash Guns Chaos, which I thought was terrible and so did critics.

Even worse, I had to go in and update the Wikipedia entries, which is presumably where the author culled the information from, not bothering to verify it. What's the world coming to if we can't trust Wikipedia?!

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_3_launch#United_States_launch_titles

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_video_game_console_launch_games#PlayStation_3

Sorry Gergo Vas, but your ""article"" sucked. It was uninformative, it was factually incorrect, it was incomplete, and I fixed it with just a couple minutes of searching. You could have added some information about the launch, the prices, the bundles, the stories of people being beaten up and robbed, but no. You just lazily posted pictures and like clockwork, none of the higher ups at the site gave a damn, because all that matters is hits. Why not give me your job?

A lot of this seems to be summed up in the latest blog post as well: http://blog.us.playstation.com/2011/04/30/press-release-some-playstation-network-and-qriocity-services-to-be-available-this-week/

**About the attack**

* Not related to Anonymous, although they did bring up that they were being attacked by them for the past few months (repeatedly stated it was limited to DDoS).

* This intrusion was very skillful and passed their firewall and other security measures because it looked like a normal transaction. It then made a tunnel and had a command attached as a trigger, at which point it was able to be manipulated remotely.

* The attack used a known vulnerability. However, this vulnerability was not known to the management (really hope I understood that part correctly since it's a biggie). Since then, security measures have been improved against that mechanism of attack.

* Because it was an advanced attack and left ""no traces"", they didn't learn of it until the 19th/20th of April. They still aren't aware of the scope of the data compromised, but say that CC info was a low possibility, since it was stored in a different part of the database and not likely read.

* It took them until the 27th of April to confirm that data was compromised. They had been working with 3 different analysis entities starting from the 20th.

* Information of up to 78 million accounts were taken, but some were likely duplicate/backup accounts. They later were asked about sales data, said that 37 million PS3s and 16 million PSPs had connected to PSN (install base of 50/69mil). There were 10 million Credit Card connected to PSN at some points.

* From what I understood, it seems that Sony will be doing more testing/inspection of its security measures to prevent future incidents like this. At the time though, SNEI believed their security to be good enough.


**Compromised Information**

* Hirai said that no improper CC usage has been reported and they have no evidence of CC info being compromised. They said that Sony will pay for CC reissuing and assist with monitoring/insurance programs for customers. If there are any improper charges, they will be handled on a case-by-case basis.

* CC info was encrypted and stored in a different part of the database from user personal information. Because of this, user information and CC information are being categorized separately.

* User passwords were not encrypted, but were hashed.

* Is still analyzing data of the attack, so they weren't saying a whole lot about what had been taken.



**Investigation**

* Entities from outside of Japan have contacted Sony and requested that they cooperate with their investigation process. FBI HQ seems to be the most involved currently. List of questions from USA House of Representatives has been received.

* Didn't give any more information, just said that investigations had been started globally.

* They weren't aware of the extent of the attack until the 27th of April, the conference was delayed because there was much more that they wanted to work out (in terms of compensation and other considerations).



**Resumption of Services and Compensation**

* PSN compensation and CC-type compensation are being considered separately. **Sony says they will cover credit card reissuing fees** and will assist with credit monitoring/insurance programs.

* Again saying that PSN will be online ""within a week."" Going to be incrementally bringing services back online. Different regions may see services at different times.

* All PSN users will get one free month of PSN+ (current PSN+ subscribers will also get 30 free days), Qrocity subscribers will get a free month, and there will be some titles available for free download. Will differ based on region and their plans are not finalized as of yet.

* All services to be back online within a month.

* As far as cost to Sony, they weren't sure and it'd vary by region, but $15-$20 for PSN+ and a few thousand yen for the titles.



**Immediate Actions Being Taken**

* Moving the data center from San Diego to a more secure location and adding new detection measures, firewalls, and encryption to make data more secure. Creating a new job position to monitor security. These things have already been done to an extent, but they wouldn't comment specifically out of security considerations.

* Sony is going to have a way for users to look at purchase history online (I think before PSN is actually up) to check for any abnormalities.

* Sony will allow users to leave PSN. They are looking into ways to refund any balances on PSN or PSN+ fees if those exist for the user. There was one conflicting answer about this, but I'm pretty sure they're working on a system to allow users to leave and erase their info if they desire.

* Firmware will need to be updated as soon as PSN is back up and users will need to change their password. **Passwords can only be changed on the PS3 system the account was created or via a verified email address.** That seemed like a super important point, but it was only mentioned once. However, that means people don't have to worry about a mad dash to change their password before a hacker does. As far as users changing a password from ""A"" to ""B"" and then back to ""A,"" they'll alert users if they're doing something like that, or if it's close to their username or something.

* Apparently the updates in Japan were even slower than the ones in the US/EU, so in Japan they're probably going to set up a blog similar to the NA/EU.

* Tablet/NGP launch dates will not be affected.

* They'll possibly be taking measures against the root key thing, although this part wasn't clear and was there was a lot of rambling.

* Want to re-earn user trust as well as developer trust on the PSN ecosystem.

One if my biggest annoyances with the console is in an update a while ago every time I opened my trophies it synced them with the server. This was a problem because if I simply wanted to check them, I had to wait a good 30 seconds to look. I know that doesnt sound like long, but count it out Mississipi style. I just recently found out if you hover over the trophy button in the media bar, and then press triangle, two opions will come up. ""Sync with server"" and ""Change modes"". If you click change modes you can switch to offline mode your system wont sync your trophies every time you open them. This made the trophies open immediately, which completely solved my problem. To sync it, press the first option, or change modes back, or if you have PS+ it will do it over night if you have that feature set up. Enjoy guys!

This HAS to stop before it becomes an uncontrollable issue.,315,68,42,http://www.reddit.com/r/PS3/comments/h2oq4/rps3_plagued_with_spammers_this_has_to_stop/,"Remember [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/report_the_reposters/comments/gqdnw/seo_spammers_have_figured_out_how_to_game_reddit/) shit? Or even [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/gepnl/gamepro_g4tv_and_vgchartz_gamrfeed_have_been/) shit? Yeah, it's happening here too. And it needs to stop.  

 
It seems for every legitimate piece of information, there are plenty of blogspammers to rehash the exact same info, and spam their link in /r/PS3. Some of them even have multiple puppet accounts to upvote their submissions with. I really don't have the energy to find *all* of their accounts, but it's quite obvious that's what they're doing. That's how this little scheme works. And it's happening, now.

This motherfucker, [Horward](http://www.reddit.com/user/Horward), is one of the worst. My guess is he has 4 accounts he uses to prop the upvotes and put his submission into view, thus making it into the ""hot"" section of smaller subreddits like this, which in *our* case, means page 1 -__-   

I'm guessing 4 accounts because if you look at a lot of his 0 point submissions, you will see a common trend of ""5 upvotes"". 4, including his upvote.  

Here's another spammer, [Snoogans2you](http://www.reddit.com/user/Snoogans2you), and one of his little puppet accounts (I haven't searched for more), [elmapache](http://www.reddit.com/user/elmapache) **[EDIT: Snoogans2you has gone through his account and deleted a bunch of his submissions/comments]**. While it may look like these are just regular users, that's exactly what they want you to think. Look at the first 2 links I submitted at the beginning of this post, you will see that these spammers will go to great lengths to blend into the rest of reddit. But it's quite obvious what they're doing. They're ***""social media experts""***, and they know how to game reddit. This is the exact same shit that ruined Digg.

Oh lookey, here's [***another***](http://www.reddit.com/user/wccftech) spammer.  

And [another](http://www.reddit.com/user/pezcore343) one who spams all over reddit, but just recently brought his bullshit to /r/PS3.

Seriously, in subreddits like this, we have to recognize and downvote this bullshit. No more scrolling/upvoting/scrolling/upvoting again even though you just upvoted another story with the *same* exact information as the last story you upvoted. It lessens the quality of this subreddit. As long as submissions with 1 upvote can make it to page 1 of our subreddit, this will remain an issue. I am ***tired*** of seeing the main article about the PSN update or whatever it may be, located at the top of the subreddit, and then seeing a trail of shitty blog spam to follow it down the rest of the page. I have to waste my fucking time, scanning through every link on the front page, trying to sort through the spam-copies and useless information loaded onto shitty blogs just so I can find a legitimate article to read. That's not what this subreddit should be like. We should have everything clear, and official, and easy to read. Not shit like ""WILL SONY'S COMPENSATION BE ENOUGH TO SWAY YOU BACK?! CAST YOUR VOTE NOW ON MY BLOGGG SYYYTTEEEE!!1!!""  

I know blogspam is nothing new to the internet world, but with the recent amount of info coming from Sony regarding the PSN attacks, you will see 10x the amount of rehashed info spammed into this subreddit by fuckers like these. This is a busy time for this subreddit, and if we don't stop it now, it will eventually turn this whole place to shit. And I love my PS3 and this subreddit, so I refuse to let that happen.

**tl;dr - Blog spammers are rehashing official Sony statements and putting it in their blog which they spam this subreddit with. They have the upper hand when spamming a subreddit as small as this. It ends. Now.**  

EDIT: I'm pleased to see a lot of it is getting downvoted and off of Page 1. It leaves quite a few self posts, but there's nothing wrong with that. These spamming fuckers can't win against all 16,000+ of us.  

**EDIT 2: Thanks to [hueypriest](http://www.reddit.com/r/PS3/comments/h2oq4/rps3_plagued_with_spammers_this_has_to_stop/c1s7rgd) for deleting/banning these fuckers.

1336001810.0,222,self.PS3,t45wl,Playstation Plus is pretty f***ing awesome. (x-post from r/gaming),301,79,201,http://www.reddit.com/r/PS3/comments/t45wl/playstation_plus_is_pretty_fing_awesome_xpost/,"*I originally posted this to r/gaming but it's getting down-voted pretty hard for some reason.*

I don't think Playstation Plus gets the recognition it deserves. Aside from a whole bunch of discounts on games, free avatars and themes, cloud saves and automatic updates and game-patches while you sleep there is a TON of free content and it just keeps getting better and better.
There is a roster of free games that rotates every month, but the thing is, as long as you have downloaded a free game once, it is available for you for the whole duration of your plus subscription. That means you can redownload any game that you got for free for as long as you have your plus subscription. I just mention this because some non-plus subscribers mistakenly seem to think that the games on plus are only free for the month that they are available.


The free games available since December:


**PS3/PSN Games:**

*Back to the Future (Whole series)

*Swords and Soldiers

*Simpsons Arcade

*Far Cry 2

*Sly Cooper HD

*Street Fighter 2 Turbo HD

*Shank 2

*Need for Speed Shift 2

*Frogger Returns

*Awesomenauts

*Trine 2

*Rock of Ages

*Tomb Raider Underworld

*Marvel Pinball

*Battle Fantasia

*Fatal Inertia EX

*Inferno Pool

*Mahjong Tales

*Sackboy's Prehistoric Moves


**Sega Genesis Games**

*Altered Beast

*Comix Zone

*Golden Axe

*Streets of Rage 2

*Sonic 1

*Sonic 2


**PSOne classics**

*Syphon Filter 1,2 and 3

*Final Fantasy V

*Um Jammer Lammy

*Silent Hill

*Castlevania SotN

*Castlevania Chronicles

*Spyro 1,2 and 3


**Early Beta Access**

*Starhawk

*Gotham City Impostors

*Pixel junk 4am

*Ghost Recon Future Soldier


That is a buttload of content. Some of it is total crap (I'm looking at you, Frogger Returns) but a lot of it is really good. And even the stuff that is just OK has provided me with many hours of entertainment when it's all added up.

Just to be clear **I am not a shill for Sony** nor am I some fanboy who thinks they can do no wrong. I'm just a gamer who thinks more people should know what a deal PS+ is. I only have two friends on my friends list who has Plus and I have a feeling that Sony has just done a shit job of getting the word out as to what Plus is and why anyone would want to subscribe. They also offered some pretty lame shit when they gave everyone those free months last year, which was just a(nother) dumb move on their part. But the service has been getting better and better over the last 8 months or so.


EDIT: Just for clarification, that's all the stuff that has been available at one point or another since December, not all the stuff available right now. Right now is Awesomenauts, Trine 2, Castlevania SotN, Castlevania Chronicles, all the Genesis games and some random other C-list PSN games.",,False,,t5_2qhhw,True,,psn,True,t3_t45wl,http://www.reddit.com/r/PS3/comments/t45wl/playstation_plus_is_pretty_fing_awesome_xpost/,

Today marked the end of my Xbox gaming. I hadn't even turned on my Xbox in at least three months, so I decided that it was time to try out the PS3. Especially with the upcoming 'The Last of Us' release. The trade in at GameStop ended up allowing me to do a straight trade over to the Uncharted bundle along with a three month PS+ card.

After booting up the PS3 and updating it I was floored by the differences between the Xbox experience and the PS3 experience. The PS3 seems very similar to the Steam experience on PC as far as how games are handled and various sales. Not to mention the beautiful thing that is PS+. I can't believe I have 14 games (20 if PS Vita is include) available out of the box without purchasing a single one! My only regret is that I missed the cutoff for Demon's Souls.

**This is amazing.**

There is one question I have to ask this community though. The console didn't come with a headset, but as far as I know the communication is run through Bluetooth. So what are your favorite headsets?

I had disabled auto-renew before when I was unsure about future employment so I had to do it manually(Jan 9th).  That alone is no big deal.  When I renewed manually, it re-activated auto-renewal.  You would think this wouldn't auto-renew the account until 2014 since it was just manually renewed days earlier.  You'd be wrong.  On Jan 14th(the day it would have expired) the auto-renewal kicked in and decided to renew my not expired membership.  Due to the way it's set up, this did not give me two years.  That is, not that I could see from the console side of things.  So auto-renewal caused what is essentially a double charge.

Now I'm fine with this since I had the extra money, and Sony's support people were quick about reversing it once I contacted them.  But I know some people(like me a year ago) wouldn't be in a spot where they could be OK with that.  So I guess my warning is this:  Either let it auto-renew, wait to renew until it has expired, or renew and disable auto-renewal when it comes time to renew your PS+.  It'll save you $50 and a couple days of back and forth emails and phone calls.",,False,,t5_2qhhw,1359575712.0,,psn,True,t3_17knbx,http://www.reddit.com/r/PS3/comments/17knbx/fair_warning_about_manually_renewing_ps/,

I'm a patient guy, so when they said it may take a couple of weeks, I was OK with it. Shit happens, and Sony was the recipient this time around.

They then had the press conference, saying that the PSN should (without any hiccups) come back within the week. I've worked in software development, so I understand if it missed this date by a few days. I couldn't wait for it to be back up.

The outage is now in its third week, and I'm starting to lose a bit of patience. The lack of communication from Sony isn't helping at all; a new approximation of when it'll be back would ease my worries. 

Does anybody else feel this, or am I becoming self-entitled like guys who complained on day 1?

*Full disclosure, I'm a Playstation Plus subscriber. I also own Portal 2, and want to play with the SDK they released a day or so ago!*

I have a PSP 3001 and some games that have been gathering dust on my shelf. I thought about selling on ebay, but I'd rather just make a kid's day.

I'd like this to go to a kid that would normally not be able to have or afford something like this. A gamer kid. Or a parent that can't afford it, but who wants to do something special for his or her kid.

The games are:
Rachet and Clank: Size Matters
Sega Genesis Collection
Daxter (This one might not read right if I remember, friggen Gamestop!)
MVP Baseball  (This one reads, but is shakey)
MLB 09 The Show
SSX on Tour
Patapon
I also have a charger.

I know this is Reddit. I know there will be trolls and tools just trying to get a free PSP. But please think about this. I beg you, don't be a douchebag. Reddit is chaos and light. But it is a community, and I just want this to go to a good kid that would normally not have the opportunity to game. Please don't post if that's not you. Otherwise, I promise you will go the the ""special hell.""

Please don't PM me. I'll check the comments tomorrow and select a comment that looks right. I'll be checking the comment history of the person I select to get an idea that I'm not sending this to some tool trying to take a PSP away from a good kid. I know I can't be sure, but I'll do my best. At a certain point, you just have to make a choice and trust. 

I won't give this directly to a minor. I'm older and I think it's creepy for a dude my age to be sending mail directly to someone underage. I'll need to verify in some way that I'm sending this to an adult/parent/uncle/whatever.

Shipping is on me. Remember... don't be a tool.

Update: Game over guys. Something about BloodTsunami's post caught my eye. We had a short chat and he seems to be a good dude trying to do something nice for his daughter. The PSP and games go to him. Thanks for all the kind words folks. For those of you who suggested a local hospital, I was under the impression that gaming charities only want current gen hardware. Don't think the PSP quite counts anymore. Cheers!",,False,,t5_2qhhw,1348949956.0,,,True,t3_10nnl4,http://www.reddit.com/r/PS3/comments/10nnl4/anybody_know_or_have_a_gamer_kid_that_deserves_a/,

It was booming, almost every game I joined was full. Extremely fun game that I have few criticisms of. Some very exploitable glitches, games resulting in stalemates too often, poor platform for communication between teams, slightly imbalanced maps. But overall, it's a great game, and these are things that could be fixed pretty easily in a sequel.

But there's a problem. Now, it's pretty much dead. I mean like less than 100 people playing routinely dead. At this point I'd be surprised if they kept the servers on throughout 2013 (assuming it uses servers to begin with). The last few nights I've tried playing with a bud, less than 5 people have joined my game overall. And with Titan Studios dissolved, the chances of it getting a direct sequel are pretty slim I'd think.

I'd hate to see this game and its concept die completely, as there aren't really any other experiences like it out there. It has very simple mechanics that take minutes to learn, perfect pick up and play kind of game. I've played it on/off for the last 3 years. Yet despite its simplicity, it has a surprising amount of strategic depth and resource management that varies depending on the map, and your team's success depends completely on how well you are willing to cooperate. It's a very unique game and it'd be a complete shame if it dropped off the face of the planet entirely, especially when its concept leaves much room for refinement.

So what better way to get the ball rolling again than to offer it for free to PS+ subbers? I'm sure it'd bring the player base back up to a few thousand, at least. There's also a DLC that has 3 classes that are, in my opinion, way too damn good to just ignore, so it won't be for naught as I'm sure a good amount of people will buy that if it isn't offered for free alongside the game.

If nothing else, they should at least drop the price, it's been $15 since launch and has never gone on sale afaik. And to those who have never played it, give the demo a shot, the only restriction on it is the map you're allowed to play on.

Many new titles have been released, this subreddit has ballooned in subscribers, the whole security fiasco occurred, and it appears the PS3 now has taken second spot in the global console install base race.

As always, one game per thread, leave comments to the replies. I know this request will fall on deaf ears, but what the heck: resist the urge to downvote games, we're trying to measure how many people like a title without making it a competition. Lists of games in a single post are of course useless and will be fed to the hounds.

After this thread has had some time to bake I'll be editing this comment and making some summarizations for top games, categories include Best Overall Games, Best PS3 Exclusives and Best PSN Games. If you think of any more that might be useful (and easy to determine from the title), feel free to privately message the idea to me.

EDIT: I'm a little surprised I need to mention this, but don't post games that are not out yet. You cannot recommend something which you haven't played, let alone completely unavailable.

Maybe, someone posts a game, day and time and the one(s) that get most upvotes win? Perhaps different gaming nights for different parts of the world?

So far I see that [r/ps3bc2](http://www.reddit.com/r/ps3bc2/) has gaming nights, but how about we set them up for other games?  
**EDIT**: r/ps3bc2 has a good system working. I don't know how they defined the days and times they'd play, but they made different Gaming Zones: Asia, Europe, US (east and west). There are Region Group Leaders, you add them on PS3 and they give you an invite to a chat. I think that they use the chat to organize which games they're going into. I think I could make a Google Docs form so we could see which games would be the most suitable ones (MW and BF have their own subreddits, so I think that they don't count-- they already have established gaming nights.) and how many people from each region/timezone we have so we can set up.

**EDIT 2**: [Malheke](http://www.reddit.com/r/PS3/comments/l60yb/so_we_all_have_a_ps3_i_suggest_we_set_up_rps3/c2q2dtp) suggested we check out [r/rdtclan](http://reddit.com/r/rdtclan).

Mini Edit: I have MAG, Warhawk, Metal Gear Online, Wipeout, LittlebigPlanet and Bad Company 2. If anyone wants to play, just add me, my PSN ID is MrReevers. Tell me you're from r/ps3 :)

I know that we can watch YouTube through that annoying interfaced browser on the PS3. But I prefer not to. For two reasons:

1. The interface fucks me off. To manoeuvre the L key on the make Full screen icon, and the jerky video in the minimized window is just wrong.

2. And once it is playing, on full screen, on a 42"" HDTV, it looks horrible. PS3 can handle Full HD. But why is the browser still stuck at 240p or 360p (can't say which one) ?

After all the pain I went through to finishing this today I'd just appreciate some feedback and maybe a few upvotes : 3 hopefully this guide will serve you guys well as it did me. 


~~I am not talking anything illegal, if anything this is beneficial for your PS3.~~

~~On my local forum is a guide on how to outsource the job of downloading PSN titles FROM the PS Store and via a proxy server outsourcing the job of downloading to your laptop / PC using a download manager so you have faster downloading speed and chances of corrupt files goes down to 0%!~~

~~I have been using this for a year or so now and love it but I thought that since I see quite the number of posts complaining about slow downloads on PSN I can be of assistance.~~

~~Would you guys be interested if I were to go through with taking the time to rewrite the original guide in more ""layman"" i.e simpler terms so that every user can understand it?~~

~~UPDATE: Made a lot of progress in the university today but since laptop is runnning windows 8 consumer preview and my ps3 and win 7 laptop are home ill finish the guide by tomorrow at latest and put it on the blog i write for.~~

~~I still have to take pictures of the PS3 and the network settings screen shots on windows 7, i hope you guys can wait a couple more days : &gt;~~

~~**UPDATE 2**: Done with the screenshot / network explanation phase for the PC screens now gonna go home today and take some pictures of what to do on the PS3 version with my phone and edit them, then have to watermark, edit up for my blog and as soon as it's published on the blog I will share the link with you guys :D I hope you guys can wait just one more day!

We generally have more rules for these threads than others as we want to provide these as an ongoing tool for the next year. As such, a couple things to keep in mind:

* If you're going to post a game title, **ensure someone else hasn't posted it first**. We'll delete any duplicate games to keep the thread clean
* If it is indeed appropriate to post a game title, ensure you only **post the game title itself** - not lists, additional comments, etc. We'll delete those as well. Save the comments for the replies - you can post an entire essay as a reply if you'd like :)
* Don't post an obscene number of games attempting to karma whore. You're free to post one or two, but let others share in the love.
* **Don't downvote games**, there's just absolutely no need for that. Vote up the games you recommend, and leave it at that.

Remember, we're not only looking for full retail games, but PSN games as well!

The file is 194 MB.**


For those who have been affected by update 4.45 and have no XMB. This is what you will most likely have to do to update to the new firmware.

What you need:

* USB formatted in FAT32 with 1gig to be safe.
* Controller and USB charging cable for controller

Most updates are only 100mb, but it wouldn't hurt to have a larger one. To format your USB to FAT32 if it isn't already, you can plug it into your computer, go to My Computer, then right click on it and go to format. This will most likely delete everything on it when you format it to FAT32 so be sure to move everything off of it.

If you are on a Mac. From CVance1:
&gt;For those of you using a Mac and needing to reformat the drive: Insert Drive, go to Disk Utility, click the drive, then click erase, choose FAT32, then click erase. 

Once the update is out and you have it downloaded. Make a folder in your USB Called ""PS3"". It has to ""PS3"", it can not be ""ps3"". In that folder make a folder called ""UPDATE"". Once again, it has to be ""UPDATE"" and not ""update"" or any variation. Then, place the downloaded update file into the ""UPDATE"" folder.

Now, you will have to boot your PS3 into Safe Mode. When I have done this in the past I have needed the A/V cables for my PS3 because it resets it to default settings so my HDMI doesn't work.

* Make sure your PS3 is off. The power light is Red.
* Touch and hold the Power button (do not remove your finger from the button). You will hear the first beep, meaning the PlayStation 3 is powering on.
* Continue to hold the Power button and after about 5 seconds, you will hear a second beep, indicating the video reset.
* Continue to hold the Power button and after about another 5 seconds you will hear a third beep and the system will power off (Power light is red).

The system should now be off again. The power light should be Red. Then,

*  Touch and hold the Power button (again, do not remove your finger from the button). As in Step 2, you will hear the first beep, again for the PlayStation 3 to power on.
* Continue to hold the Power button and after about 5 seconds, you will hear a second beep for video reset.
* Continue to hold the Power button and after about another 5 seconds you will hear a quick double beep. At that point release the Power button. If you succeeded in activating Safe Mode, you will see a message on the screen saying, ""Connect the controller using a USB cable and then press the PS button.""

Now on your screen it should ask you to plug in your controller with the USB cable. If the message doesn't show and you are using an HDMI cable, you may need to switch to the A/V cables.

Once you have the controller plugged in and have pushed the PS button. You can plug in your USB drive with the update on it into the PS3. Go down to 6 which is to manually update PS3. It will then ask to to insert a USB with firmware 4.45 or higher. You then press select and start at the same time and it will search your USB for the ""PS3"" folder and ""UPDATE"" in that folder to find the update you downloaded before.

It should then update your console and restart and hopefully it will take you to the XMB and everything should be fixed. You just might have to change some Video settings if you had to switch to the A/V cables.

Lets also hope this doesn't involve us losing our data on our hard drives.

EDIT4: Mother of god the 4.46 update worked! Successfully manually updated with the 4.46 update provided and it booted up to the XMB with all Saves and data still there.

EDIT5: I hope everyone else has some good luck with their PS3's and updating them.

I hope they don't realize this for awhile.

1375003466.0,138,self.PS3,1j7izp,List of Top Games on the PS3,198,60,208,http://www.reddit.com/r/PS3/comments/1j7izp/list_of_top_games_on_the_ps3/,"The PS3 generation is about to give way to the PS4, and I think it is time for us all to look back at some of the greatest titles on the console, explain why each one is worthy to us and try to get others to catch up if they're interested in something they had missed.

**The only prerequisites are that they were released on the PS3, and that you have played it. No fluff, just the best. If you can't explain why, don't put it in your list.**

I'll start with my own list:

* **The Last of Us:** The survival game most voted as the best game to ever appear on the Playstation 3. Top notch storytelling, characters and environment. The tragedy in every act is perfectly balanced with the other elements of the game, from beginning to end.
* **Bioshock Infinite:** The first-person shooter, city in the sky game that introduced truly intelligent AI to the PS3 gamers. The story can be a bit confusing to follow, and some elements of previous games in the series appear here. This game will haunt your thoughts long after you finish it.
* **Valkyria Chronicles:** A turn-based strategy JRPG mashup in an anime version of World War II, with anime guys and girls running around with guns shooting at ~~Nazis~~ Imperials. The formula doesn't only work, but shines. The tactical planning is actually fun, the story explores some profound themes about warfare without preaching about it, and some of the encounters will kick your ass the first time through. You'll find yourself rooting for specific members in your squad, even if their survival may be irrelevant to the story. I know I have. It's the only game I replayed more than twice and I still focus on the same core squad.
* **Metal Gear Solid 4:** This is the definitive Metal Gear title for this generation. It continues the Metal Gear Solid heritage of over-the-top threats to world peace, over-the-top boss encounters and extremely convoluted storyline. And by the time you finish the first act, you're already hooked and want to see what's next.
* **Uncharted:** I was torn over which Uncharted game to put here, and I picked the first Uncharted because it played beautifully on your not knowing the characters you're interacting with. As with the next installments of the series, it maintains a brilliant combination of clever, unconventional puzzles with impressive set pieces and interesting overarching stories.
* **Mortal Kombat:** The game that boldly reset the timeline of the franchise, then proceeded to brutally dissect it. Make no mistake, this game is as gruesome as any Mortal Kombat title can ever be, and the addition of a single, multi-character canon storyline only makes the deal that much sweeter.
* **Fallout 3:** The game that introduced me to the post-apocalypse. It also got me interested in open-world games. While exploring post-apocalyptic DC might not be the most exciting premise for a game, Fallout makes it soar. This was the first title on the list I was actually excited about, and I even got the game of the year edition and played it again.
* **The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim:** Take Fallout, remove all tech, add magic, dragons, and a lush fantasy world with meadows, snowy peaks, villages, fortresses and political intrigue. Play this game twice. Once to rush through the story and feel like a champion, and again to be thorough and explore every hut, cave, temple and city. The amount of love poured into every detail of this game is breathtaking. There are surprises everywhere, if you're willing to look close enough.
* **Mass Effect 2:** The sci-fi action RPG that gives you the biggest bang for your buck. There's more to do here than you could ever do in the other two titles in the trilogy. While you spend the majority of the game building up your squad and earning their loyalty, it doesn't feel like a big fetch mission. Instead, every character's story is extremely deep in its own way, and by the time the ""suicide mission"" at the end of the game takes place, you'll keep asking yourself if you've done enough to keep your teammates safe.
* **Portal 2:** Mind-bending puzzles using portals, combined with a cast of quirky and insane robots that make some of the most hilarious comments with perfect timing throughout the game. It is a simple premise in theory, but like the rest of the games on this list, the execution is perfect. And the haunting chorus at the end sticks with you forever.
* **inFamous:** What would you do if you got super powers? This game explores that question, and allows you to be a hero or a villain as you take on a gang of villains either because you're fighting for justice, or because they're invading your turf. The twists and turns in this game are well done, even if some side quests seem to be a little too repetitive.
* **Heavy Rain:** Critiqued by many people for looking like a long series of quick-time events, this game presents a completely new way of storytelling in games. You're introduced to four characters connected in an investigation over a serial killer, and the choices you make have serious consequences, up to and including the death of each and every character.
* **Tomb Raider:** This reboot takes the lessons learned from the Uncharted series, and brings it back full circle to introduce a younger, more realistic version of Lara Croft in her first adventure when her ship is literally torn in half and she's stranded with a small number of surviving crew members on a mysterious island that seems to want them dead.
* **Soul Calibur IV:** If I had to choose one fighting game to play for the rest of my life, this would be it. I returned to it after the disappointing sequel, which eliminated many characters and replaced them with overpowered versions of them. Soul Calibur IV was responsible for many nights lost challenging friends for ""just another round.""
* **Dragon Age: Origins:** The first truly fantasy epic game of this generation. The fantasy RPG has you rise up to your destiny to face a dark horde of evil creatures commanded by a demigod. It sounds cliche, and maybe it is. But its execution is beautiful as you travel across the game world trying to gather support for your cause, and inevitably having to deal with the problems facing each of your potential supporters. Mass Effect 2 and 3 took a page from this game's book.
* **Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare:** The first person shooter with online multiplayer that took the world of gaming by storm. It was special back in the day. But today, there's not much reason to play it. And if you do, you're be confronted by prepubescent kids talking big about your mom. So don't. Just ignore this entry, and consider it a classic you'll never revisit.

1348863757.0,129,self.PS3,10mx01,Just picked up a new PS3 ultra-slim,161,32,133,http://www.reddit.com/r/PS3/comments/10mx01/just_picked_up_a_new_ps3_ultraslim/,"I'll keep editing to add to the review as we go along.

*First thoughts* (opened in Gamestop parking lot, haven't plugged it in yet)

- It feels like the entire box is smaller than my original PS3 fatty console.

- Overall design is still very sleek, very Sony.

- Whole device is heavier than expected.  Thicker, heavier, bulkier than PSTwo (think, a med-large textboox).

- Corrugated top doesn't look bad in person, prevents fingerprints, gives grip on sliding disk tray cover.  Top does appear to pick up small bits of ""gunk"" easily (packing cardboard, dust).

- Door mechanism slides well, but the drive cover feels really thin and flimsy.  Already concerned about breakage, especially considering how often it's intended to be touched.

- Door mechanism can be activated by button in front, or by simply sliding it open with your hands.  Not sure if that's the same once it's turned on?

- The front has one long, skinny bar with a pivot at the center.  Pressing on the right side of the pivot bar turns on the PS3.  Pressing on the left side of the long pivot bar opens the top of the loading tray.  This long skinny piece of rubbery plastic feels like it's designed to eventually break, though both underlying buttons would likely still work even if the longer bar eventually cracks along the pivot.

- Yeah, no HDMI cable.  How silly is that.

Overall, it doesn't have the same small, durable feel of the PSOne or PSTwo.  At the same time, the loading mechanism and shiny finish make it feel decidedly less premium than the PS3 slim.  However, the simpler drive mechanism and the simpler cooling setup (from a likely processor die shrink) should make this the more reliable PS3 to date.

I'll upload pics and more impressions when I get to turn it on later tonight.

EDIT:

 - All along the front of the PS3 are some subtle grooves, making the design consistent with the corrugated top. Nice design touch. 

 - Disc cover works the same when turned on. Can be opened by lightly forcing the cover with your hand, or using the physical button. Either one quickly stops a spinning disk. 

 - Disc spinning up is more noisy than I expected. I think it's noisier than my fat was?  However, it is still much quieter the disc noise from my Wii or Xbox.

 - Console came with 30 days free of PS Plus, so I'm trying that out. PS Plus is nice--lots of great games.  I'm downloading them all right now, so I haven't actually played anything yet. Lots and lots of installing. Left it all overnight. Still installing.

 - Console is standing on edge right now (I'm out of space!). It is not particularly stable on edge (too thin, no rubber feet). I'm guessing there will eventually be a stand.

I figured out last night why there's no HDMI, but there is A/V connector.  You can buy HDMI everywhere (like Ethernet cable) but the A/V connector is proprietary. ",,False,,t5_2qhhw,1348931272.0,,,True,t3_10mx01,http://www.reddit.com/r/PS3/comments/10mx01/just_picked_up_a_new_ps3_ultraslim/,

1305940225.0,118,self.PS3,hgcmj,L.A Noire - A review (with no spoilers),145,27,76,http://www.reddit.com/r/PS3/comments/hgcmj/la_noire_a_review_with_no_spoilers/,"It's not often that i feel the need to espouse my opinion on a game on a public forum.  L.A Noire, however, seems to have changed that and I figured if I gave a little review, then some people who were not sure whether they wanted to buy it or not - could make an informed decision.

Before I get to gameplay, I am going to start by saying this is the most well presented game I have ever played in over 25 years of gaming.  The attention to detail of this period-piece, is unsurpassed.  Every single asset in this game has been thoroughly researched to bring you, the player, in to an authentic replica of 1940s Los Angeles.  Right down to library cards, police reports and other official paraphernalia.  Through-out your stay in Los Angeles, you will be greeted with period advertising, radio stations, and the old ""ticking"" sound that traffic lights made on the crosswalk.

I am not going to give away the plot as I think this is the kind of game you put in to your console, and just lose yourself in.  Like many others on reddit, I was excited at the techniques used to capture facial animations.  Little did I know how important they would play, even in the most innocuous of characters.

I am going to go out on a limb here, and say that it is the best game that I have played to date.  Sure, it has its faults (I don't like how fast it cuts to a cut-scene on my arrival at a location, for example).  But the faults are few and far between.

Game-play wise, you'll find yourself assuming the role of a war-hero, and up and coming policeman in the LAPD.  The game does an excellent job of introducing you to the basics through some beginner missions in which you'd be hard put to mess up.  Each mission involves a crime scene and on arrival it is up to you to investigate the scene and talk to anyone there who may know something, even if it is just the coroner.  Although running around trying to find clues could potentially be boring or infuriating, the developers have done a fantastic job of presenting an otherwise potentially boring walkabout, by use of visual clues, music and hints.

Interviewing suspects is the fois-gras of this game and sole reason all that money has been spent on facial recognition.  I've seen other people this week struggle with the Truth, Doubt &amp; Lie system.  I found it to be incredibly well executed and once you get used to looking for people's facial responses, it's not so always so difficult to know if they are telling the truth or not.  Accusing them of lying, though, always has to be backed up with evidence.  One of the good things I found here, was that the game makes you feel like you need to be making the right choices *now* as opposed to getting a wrong answer and then immediately quitting and reloading.  I have not done this yet as the game provides other means of getting the information you need.  In fact, one of my only other frustrations was understanding what had happened in a case and yet having to go through the motions to prove it to the game.  But this wasn't a fault of the game, it was more like me jumping the gun.

Coming from the sandbox violent-fest that is GTA, I was initially worried about not having my free-time between cases.  That feeling went pretty fast, because for the first time in my rockstar-gaming career, I didn't feel like murdering people.  Our Protagonist, Cole Phelps, actually makes us more ethical.  I didn't have any desire to run down random people, and didn't feel like I had lost anything by not being able to shoot them either.

Rockstar/Team Bondi have out-done themselves here.  The voice acting is incredible, the driving a breeze and the mental puzzles as you piece together the crime - a fun journey.  I have never sat down in front of a game and got so immersed in the character I was playing.  Never before have I looked at the screen and exclaimed ""Fuck you, you're lying.  And I'll find the evidence to prove it."".

L.A Noire is a game you need to own.

Thanks for your very kind email.  It was a fantastic project to be involved in, and we all found we were solving problems and facing challenges that no-one had confronted before.

So thanks for letting me know that you enjoyed it.  It makes me very happy that all that work we poured into HR has had the desired effect - an emotional connection as a foundation for a video game.  I worked on it, on and off for nearly 20 months, and at the beginning I had no way of knowing if my acting would be 'read' by the motion and facial capture.   The first inkling I had was from something so small, too.  I saw a clip they were working on, of me closing a refrigerator door in a scuzzy motel room.  The choice I had made in the studio, kicking a wire panel 'shut', read as it should in the context of the scene.  It made me so happy to see that I wasn't just a ""mocap mannaquin""!

Because a friend told me it was a great game, most of the time I spent on the PS3 was upgrading and configuring it to be able to see Netflix.

So guys what are some pointers you think I should not miss ?

I'm reading the ""Recommended games"" area atm.

Anything will sure help.

**UPDATES:** I'm re-arranging content.

Just noticed ~~we are~~ were the **TOP** thread in /PS3. **Good Job and thanks for all the advice!**

So far my list of games I'll get are:

* Assassin's Creed
* Far Cry 3 ~~( do I need to play 1 and 2 before 3 just like Assassin's Creed ? )~~ thanks for clarifying :P
* God of War SAGA
* Metal Gear Solid HD COLLECTION
* Journey
* Valkyria Chronicles
* Shadow of the Colossus
* Orange box (or just Portal ?)
* Gran Turismo
* GTA games ( Will just take the last 1 )
* Infamous 1/2
* Uncharted 1/2/3
* Little Big Planet
* Darksiders ( seems just too fighting epic ) - What do you guys think ? 
* Red Dead Redemption (if I find someone who might lend it to me)
* Mass Effect trilogy
* Fallout 3
* CoD: BlackOps 2

I think I'm missing alot but **it's going to be a rough broke FUN season thanks to all of you**  If you think I'm missing any game worth playing send me a PM.

**Pickups and Prices**

**Are this games worth playing ?**

* Dead Island

**Q?**

Isn't there a Resident Evil Compilation ?  
Are 250HDD enough for the PS3 ?

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

**Answered Questions** 

**PS+ Q?** ~~So if and when ever I pay the $5 bucks a month I'll be able to download and play (*forever*) the games that are avaliable ? So right now I get Infamous2 / LBP2 / Streetfighter ? How does it works really ?~~ Thanks for answering. **PS+** is a must but I'll tackle some games before joining.

~~What do you guys think about [Shadow of the Colossus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_of_the_Colossus) ? I saw it for 25 bucks at wallmart a week ago.~~ Thanks for the help will sure play it.

**BIG Thanks**

Thanks guys for all the support and game advice you are giving me. I think my wallet will be hurt after I get paid.

Yesterday, after a couple of weeks of not having used the console, I played some MGS Peace Walker (Metal Gear Solid HD Collection) and after about 15 minutes just managing Mother Base (assigning newly recruited staff, dispatching teams to outer ops), my PS3 suddenly turned itself off! Beep beep, blinking red light, done. Now when I turn it on it will turn itself off again after a couple seconds. I searched Google about this matter and concluded that it finally overheated after sucking in dust for 7 years and something broke. I'll either find a place that can fix it or I'll get a new one.
I have to say though that I'm very impressed it lasted so long and that it had an almost flawless record of service. I think ti only ever crashed 2 times on me; once while playing GTA4 a few years ago and once recently at the freaking start screen of the new Tomb Raider. 
If I somehow end up buying a new super slim one I hope it'll be just as great.
Also, I am so very happy I chose to try out Playstation Plus just for the hell of it a couple months ago because without my games' save data in the cloud I'd probably have lost everything since the PS3's internal HDD is encrypted and bound to the particular console. Initially int his situation I felt really bad about likely having lost everything and then I recalled the game data uploads and felt a huge relief. But I also feel very idiotic for never ever having backed up my PS3 to an external HDD at all, all the years.

Presently on my sixth (6th) XBox360, I have had the RRoD, E-74, and it all started Day 1 with me. I've had the same unique gamertag for 8 years since Xbox Live Beta. 

Aside from the multiple and ridiculous amount of actual Xbox's I've gone through, the straw that broke my back was the horrendous support from XBox Live which I received recently regarding hackers obtaining my information to XBox Live. I didn't get the memo regarding a hacker group releasing emails and passwords associated to the service and one happened to figure out mine.

Since October, I have had a rather lengthy battle of playing with Windows Live account security settings, the hacker implementing their own emails associated to the account, and calls through Microsoft and XBox support teams. The account was suspended in November by my request to get this hacker situation sorted out. 

XBox Live assured me that they would re-associate the email address to the account with a new one, and when they finally released it from the investigation (25-days) I quickly had a follow up email from the service of the hacker requesting another password reset. The email address was unchanged as promised and already compromised. The battle now continued into December. With the account free I was able to change the account myself while battling for account access with the hacker. **Neither** of the support agencies would change the account, block the hackers rather obvious email accounts, nor would they help in any other fashion than to suspend the account so no activity could be took.

However, after all that, after manually using the systems in place and taking back my gamertag with no help from MS, the customer service response specialist sympathized with my situation. However, they added on the tagline of ""Well, you do have a unique gamertag, so you should expect this.” ...  So I should expect that a service I pay for over the last 8 years to fail me and the support teams fail to correct the situation? Anyone who was not internet savvy would have lost the account, which they were trying to auction off on lovely little hacker site. 

Thanks Sony for maintaining a free service which if there is security breaches, even if they are inconvenient, they are still resolved and appropriately treated. 

Anyone else have horror stories of XBox Support? I compared the ""Gold"" Service to ""Tin"" Customer Support.

**TL;DR** 6th Xbox Console, 8 Years since XBL Beta, Hacked twice within last year, no support to correct it, 2 month battle to recover gamertag, MS “With such a unique gamertag, you have to expect that.”

1368127435.0,105,self.PS3,1e0pvz,Problems with your PS3? Read this. (lots of text),134,29,104,http://www.reddit.com/r/PS3/comments/1e0pvz/problems_with_your_ps3_read_this_lots_of_text/,"I know this is a good bit of information to take in but these are the main issues I've seen when trouble shooting systems on a daily basis for the last couple of years. I also encounter new problems or systems acting in ways I haven't seen before so it's possible your issue isn't listed here.


Since no one can diagnose your issues for sure (100%) without having the system in front of them to test, see the symptoms, and replace hardware possibly repairing the issue. Let me help you all get a head start.

First your model number starting with CECH _ _ _ _ _  can be found on the white tag on the rear of the system close to the vents and A/V outlets. These range in number from CECHA01 (a 60GB launch model from 2006) to the latest super slim numbers CECH-4000 series. This will tell us several things: the model of the laser, size of the hard drive, date production started, where it was released, power supply, PS2 support if any, and number of USB ports.

There are certain problems that usually occur with certain models the more information you can share about the problems with your PS3 will make it easier to determine what is causing the issues. 


There are usually only several things that can cause problems with the PS3:

No Audio or video displayed sometimes the A/V settings need to be reset. Press down the power button listen for the second beep (I think it's like 5-10 seconds after the system powers up). If this doesn't fix it there could be an issue with the outlet on the PS3, it could be a fried component on the motherboard, or a over heating related issue.

Hard drive issues can cause freezing, problems upon start up, problems with the wireless and blue tooth, and internet issues.

Blu ray drive issues usually cause games to freeze or randomly not be recognized at all.

Power supply issues will cause the light on the front to just go out. I have seen outlets that cause issues for consoles if there is an electrical problem as well, but it isn't common most places.

Motherboard issues or over heating will cause yellow or red flashing lights and loud fan noises. The system will not start up or only stay on a short time before flashing lights and beeping. (Power supplies can cause flashing lights but more often it's an overheating/mobo problem if the lights flash.)


Before you post asking what's wrong always try to boot to the safe menu. You do this by holding down the power button and listening for 2 fast beeps. Select option 3 this will check your hard drive for errors while not messing with the actual save files. 

It's also a good idea if you haven't already to back up your saves to a flash drive or external hard drive. Some saves don't carry over this way and require Playstation Plus to have the files backed up. 
The more details you provide the better options we can give you about having your system repaired or if it's better to just replace it.

Things like where the system is located, do pets have access, dogs and cats pee on things and this can cause major issues, as well as pet hair clogging the fan and cooling vents inside.
Roaches inside your console are there because it's nice and warm, if there are actual bugs in your system trash it. No repair shop wants it and even if they fix it you're probably living with them so that means they will return the the warmth of the console as soon as you get it back home.
Inside cabinets are the worst place to have your console. No air flow, heat can't escape properly and will eventually cause problems.
Spilling soda, water, or other liquids can short out your power supply and/or mother board. 
Compressed air rarely does anything since all of the cooling system parts are on the interior it requires at least taking off the top of the system which will void the warranty.

This isn't a complete list of all issues just the ones I see most often. Some things are easier to fix than others and sometimes it is better to just replace the system.",,False,,t5_2qhhw,1368131346.0,,psn,True,t3_1e0pvz,http://www.reddit.com/r/PS3/comments/1e0pvz/problems_with_your_ps3_read_this_lots_of_text/,

In the meantime, let's discuss some of the good lesser known  titles to find some stuff we may have overlooked.

----------------------------

I'll start: **IL-2 Sturmovik: Birds of Prey.** This game is incredible.

It's an amazing WW2 flight simulator, and is easily the best flight game on PS3 (although that's not saying much, the genre is weak for PS3). It's very ""arcadey"" until you go through the tutorial modes and unlock the realistic modes.  At this point, its an extremely well-done combat flight SIMULATOR. It is easy to learn, fun to play, and nearly impossible to master. The historial events in black-and-white news reel clips to setup each chapter are awesome.  The graphics are amazing, down to the tiny details.

I don't know how this game got overlooked, but if you have ever liked flight games, go purchase this immediately.  I got it on Amazon for under $15 after shipping.

Any advice on what to do next? Anything amazing out of the back catalogue that I'm missing? I've had a bit of a look on home, reminds me of Worlds Away from back on Compuserve.

I've borrowed Little Big planet and Resistance 2 from a friend, Uncharted is on it's way from the rental people and I have my eye on an auction for GoW Collection.

Uncharted 1, 2 and 3, Lollipop Chainsaw, FF XIII 1 and 2. Here is an honest review..",144,39,357,http://www.reddit.com/r/PS3/comments/vzax3/so_i_have_recently_purchased_a_ps3_purchased_a_ps/,"Uncharted 1, 2 and 3: Awesome suggestions everyone! Holy crap it's like being part of an epic movie. Nothing like it!

Lollipop Chainsaw: B-Movie awesomeness at it's best. The controls are a little wonky but I enjoyed the story line. The old guy cracked me up.

FF XIII 1 - 2: Beautiful Graphics and wonderful story. These are absolutely must haves!

Dark Souls: Fuck everyone that suggested this game. Seriously fuck everyone of you. I have never hated a game so much in my life yet have not been able to quit playing. This game raises my blood pressure while making my stomach fill with liquid shit, yet I can't stop.

TL;DR: Thank you, thank you, thank you and fuck you.

Edit: What game would the people here suggest? I am a fan of horror and fantasy but do not enjoy FPS games at all. Aside from Lollipop Chainsaw, I would say I enjoy thought provoking story lines and well written/ voice acted games with stunning visuals as well as smooth enjoyable game play. (Please do not suggest Skyrim as the game believe it or not puts me to sleep)

Edit 2: I was asked to give a review of the PS3 itself. I will do that gladly!

**Review of the PS3 Slim 320 packaged with Uncharted 3**

**First Reactions to the PS3 and it's physical build**
The PS3 itself is a pretty heavy little box. The thing is BIG, even as a slim model it's a rather large console. The setup of the system from a physical standpoint couldn't get any easier. Power cord, Cat5 cable, HDMI cable. The whole look of the system is sleek yet not tacky. The matte finish is a nice contrast to the 360's glaringly shiny exterior. I really like the idea of not having an opening drawer for the Blurays (I have a one and a half year old daughter that can find the eject button on anything and then happily break the drawer while giggling) The PS3 controllers aren't a surprise as the basic design has been around for a long while. The SixAxis controls built in were new though, they are a neat idea but untested to me at this point. Turning on the PS3 for the first time is almost a bit shocking as there are a short series of beeps. I assumed this was like a POST while starting up a computer. (found out I was correct in sorts)

**Software and Interface**
I'm not going to go into the entire setup of the PS3 as far as software goes. My wife and I already have PSN accounts due to having VITA's prior to buying the PS3, set up there only took a few moments. I will say that the ""Homescreen"" navigation is pretty good. It gets a bit clunky the way it separates the Network section away from the Settings section, but I can understand why they chose to do that as it's also yet another place to log in to the PStore. While we had just set up the PS3 and had just turned it on, we were bombarded with PS+ advertisements within the system. I was tempted and did in fact purchase the PS+ not just for the discounts and the account tied games, but due to wanting the advertisements off the Homescreen navigation. (Yeah I know, a bit OCD) 

**Media Servers**
Next comes setting up the media servers through the network. I did try the wireless (Which was plenty powerful) but found it lacked the speed, even as a 802.11B/G/N. Ultimately decided on running a 200+ft cat5 through the walls (only took a few hours to go to home depot, buy the cat5 and termination utility plates for the walls) hard wiring the PS3 directly. My wife and I run a total of five computers at home on our network. I'm happy to say that the PS3 found all the computers without a hitch, even her Macbook Pro. 

**Media Streaming**
I decided that a media server was in order after noticing that some file types were not supported by playback on the PS3. We went with [PS3 Media Server](http://www.ps3mediaserver.org/) for it's on the fly transcoding ability. Again the setup for the PS3 Media Server went off without a hitch. From install to running, it took very little customization to be ready to use and give us that giant green check mark stating it was ready to run.

**PS+**
With being wired, I decided ""Hey, let's DOWNLOAD ALL THE THINGS!"". So we clicked through the PStore and downloaded the 13 free games, the free Mini's and a few themes. I was happy that the downloads themselves took very little time considering they were nearly 45 gigs or so, roughly took us about 2 hours (maybe three) on backround downloads. While the downloads went pretty fast considering the sheer amount of data we decided to download, we found the installs were a bit slow, nothing I couldn't live with. 

**Physical games**
We slid in Uncharted 3 and found ourselves in need of game patches right away. Again this wasn't so bad, but I can see where it could become annoying. Between my wife and I and our happy as pie daughter, we ended up playing for about an hour and a half. We were in total awe of the graphics and the vast contrast offered up by the PS3 compared to our 360.  

**TL:DR for those too lazy to read a PS3 console review**
We are pretty damned happy with our decision to purchase a PS3, even this late in the consoles life span.",,False,,t5_2qhhw,1341408488.0,,,True,t3_vzax3,http://www.reddit.com/r/PS3/comments/vzax3/so_i_have_recently_purchased_a_ps3_purchased_a_ps/,

I started with uncharted 1 and found options to change language for text, subtitles, and movies (the in-game rendered videos), and realized that I could set the text to English, and subtitles to any of the other languages available( French, Spanish, Portuguese, German, Dutch, et cetera). I started out with French and did a play through of the game hearing what the characters said but reading it in another language. Since I had taken a bit of French in high school I knew a bit of the rules and such, but hearing English and reading French really helped my to associate words, syntax, and spelling. Then in conversations with people I would stay top think, ""hey I could've said that in French!"" I went on to the other games doing the same thing learning more and more, until I finished uncharted 3. I stopped for a little bit, and played other games, bit then went back to uncharted 1 to 100% the game, but this time I set movies to German and subtitles to English. Man now I can think in German sometimes, it absolutely amazed me that i could actually learn a language(somewhat) from playing games that I loved.

I've used gamefly for the most part to rent newer games and other than that, I have PS+ for the occasional free game and insane discount. I have maybe 10 games on PSN through PS1, PS2, and PSN titles. The only physical copy of a game I own is Fallout New Vegas (because I've put like 10 million hours into it).

I find myself in a dilemma as someone who wants to get a PS4 at launch thinking: ""Hmm, I do want to get this game, but is it worth it when I'll be getting a new system in 9 months?"". See, I'll be selling my PS3 to go towards my PS4 (I'll need the extra money), and it is sounding like there will be no way for your digital content to transfer. This has made me think much more carefully about what content I should and shouldn't buy on the PS store. Has anyone else felt this way at all since the PS4 was announced?

Edit: dang, this thread blew up since I made it before breakfast this morning.

The story seems way more mature than what I thought it would be but still light-hearted. The whole world map concept is just like Final Fantasy VII as well.

**These** are what I see as questions that are frequently asked:

- Help, YLOD!
  - Try the blow dryer trick, then the heat gun trick, the oven trick, or a 3rd party repair firm
  - If you successfully recover it, know that it will die again, probably soon. Seriously consider replacing it.
  - Try applying thermal paste as a preventative. Do backups. The PlayStation Plus service offers cloud saves as a perk.
  - Sorry, you can't just move the hard drive over to another PS3, nor can you read it/back it up from a PC

- I don't understand PlayStation Plus
  - You can play the free games you've acquired as long as you are a subscriber. You still have to acquire them when they are offered though (download, or at least mark for download - they will have a red tag once they are yours)
  - All discounted games you purchased are yours permanently, even if you let your subscription lapse
  - Yes, you should get it. The vast majority of subscribers agree it's a great value.

- Recommend me a game
  - See the FAQ in the side bar, or ask, but mention which games you've played/liked/disliked

- Will an SSD drive help?
  - Maybe, and not as much as you're hoping.
  - A hybrid drive (eg Seagate Momentus XT) will probably give you better bang for the buck

- I got a $20 gift card, what do I spend it on?
  - PlayStation Plus

So far, I own God of War Saga and Red Dead Redemption - two exclusives I've been dying to play. Buying a shooter was a risky choice, but I didn't think it would be this bad.

I'm not far into RDR (Or am I? Just go into Mexico) and I am so, so, so, so bad at shooting. Usually the little dot locks onto the nearest target when I am, but in all other occasions... Yeah, it's bad.

I swing wildly from left to right to above and below the target before finally shooting the guy's arm or foot or crotch. It's been quite a bit of game time and I'm still this awful, are there tips that I'm kind of missing here? Are there ways to get better at shooting in RDR or in shooting with a controller in general?

I'm asking because I'm thinking about whether or not I should just lay off all games with shooting elements in the future.

Sorry about the shameless plug. Since Youtube's own Youtube XL site sucks, and the regular Youtube website doesen't work at all on the PS3 web browser, I made my own [custom PS3 Youtube viewer](http://mybits.se/ps3youtube).  
  
I did it just for fun (and to polish my html/javascript skills), and really tried to create the simplest and cleanest UI that could possible work on the PS3 browser. It looks quite good on my 37 inch 720p TV. Sorry about the blocky video quality though. I can't do anything about that, as the PS3 browser does not support Flash 10.  
  
Anyway, I put quite a bit of hours into it, so I hope you like it. Feedback will be greatly appreciated. Also, the source code is very simple to read. Feel free to copy it if you find it of any use.  
  
[UPDATE]  
Thank you all for your kind input so far. I have now added search functionality. So you are no longer restricted to the channels and feeds on the page, but can also perform your own searches :-)  
  
Also, if you know of any other cool Youtube channels that I probably should add to the channel list, please let me know. I won't however add any special interest channels.
