They've had to postpone meeting up once, due to her irregular work hours, but they're all set to meet up next week.  In the course of their correspondence, she asked him if he had tried this sushi restaurant that generally costs around $150-200/person.

So there's two parts to this: He's not sure what this might indicate about the girl in general, and he's not sure exactly how to artfully and diplomatically say, ""Hell no, I'm not rich, woman! Your suggestion is unreasonable!""

She is Japanese and not very Americanized, so we're not sure how this plays into her expectations of first date etiquette.  Maybe she isn't automatically expecting him to pay for everything?  Who knows?  He also hasn't gotten any indication yet that she's a ""gold-digger"" or that she thinks he's loaded, or anything like that, but he also doesn't really know her all THAT well yet.

What do you all think?  Is this a red flag?

4/4 UPDATE:
So my friend replied to the girl saying he already had a place in mind.  Still a sushi joint, but not a super fancy one.  Girl responds by saying she actually needs to postpone again, and that was the last he heard from her.  I think he dodged a bullet here...  Thanks for all the advice, folks!

My friend is working a helpdesk in a student position. They've been working there for almost 3 years. The summer time is weird...because instead of hourly they pay you a set salary per month...but they deduct time NOT worked...rather than adding up what time you worked.

The catch is he is taking summer classes on afternoons about 3 days a week. So they are paying him for about 40 hours by default (at about 15$/hr)...but he is really only working about 30.

At the beginning of the summer he outlined exactly how many hours he was going to be working every month and gave that to his boss.

However they are in the middle of migrating everyone to VDI and windows 7...and they're also in the middle of negotiations to get a brand new billing and work management system to be implimented company wide and replace the current backend...so they've been really busy, and I think that it has slipped people's minds.

So my friend thought they had it set up that they didn't get any income tax taken off...because they are a student and they only make about 14,000 a year. So he would be getting it all back anyways. Anyways...he just checked his pay stub for the first time this summer (it's online and he was really busy with 2 difficult summer classes)...and not only have they been taking about 600$ off every paycheck...but the amount they have overpayed him is about 2000$ dollars in total (ballpark figure)

He's a broke college student that has no extra money to spare. He's paying his way through university by working in the summer to pay tuition.


How does he not fuck himself over. He doesn't want to be a thief. They WILL find out when it comes time to give him his vacation pay at the end of the summer....but he cannot afford to pay the money back AND pay for tuition...as the money was ""eaten"" by taxes...so he won't see that money until January.

Even though it is their mistake...he feels responsible for not watching his budget closer. And mind you...this is in a casual position, and this job is otherwise paying his way through school. Don't want to bite the hand that feeds you.


edit: He also found the original email that he sent to his boss with the summer hours detailed in them, as well as an email that he sent out with his complete and full summer schedule that he set up as a shared calander in outlook.

edit 2: he is also canadian...so applicable laws and all that jazz.

In the past, she didnt negotiate very well out of desperation to find any form of employment that wasnt menial, and the shitty job market.

Now, however, she feels she has a bit more leverage and doesnt have to settle for the first sum her prospective employers throw at her...

1) When is the best time to bring up compensation?

2) How do you negotiate it to your advantage?

3) She has a hard time determining what Qs are appropriate to ask, and when, can anybody shed light on  this for her?

4) She wants to know how to say ""No, thats not enough"" in a way that isnt rude or aggressive, or wont end her chances of landing the job

5) She would also like to know any general advice, or tips and tricks that one can use to their advantage.

She found out a couple days ago and was crushed. He cheated a month ago while out of town. 

When he came back they fought all weekend long. Then he was completely withdrawn and asking for space and pushing her away. Which she knew was off and tried to hold on tighter. She read his e-mail about two weeks ago. She felt bad about reading the e-mail and told him and apologized. Then he let her know that the relationship probably wasn't going to work and that he need for space/ a break. 

After all of that she found out about him cheating, the boyfriend seemed remorseful and wanting to change. He let her know he really loved her and was wanting this to work out. Letting her know she didn't deserve this and would make it better. 

However, this morning she started talking about wanting to spend time together and needing to feel loved. He freaked and said he needed space. He completely freaked out and yelled and went on about how angry he is and how now his feelings are being ignored. She now finds her begging for time. Which hurts even more and feels more lonely. 

**Is he just turning is guilt into anger?**

**Should he even be asking for space right now?** 

**Should the need for space be put on hold to help her right now?**

The question is should the problems he was creating be put on hold to deal with this big amount of hurt right now. *The question is not if she should break up with him. Which is what everyone will say!*

He has very few friends, and they're all 100% undoubtedly non-smokers and are all acting like douche-bags right now, anyway - well except for me, I'm pretty awesome, but I digress.  He has a job, but his immediate colleagues are mostly old and obviously don't smoke, and he doesn't really talk to anyone else at his place of work.  He has a girlfriend who can't smoke because she's looking for jobs ATM, and she doesn't really know many people, either.  His other friends ""don't do that stuff,"" so he's left on his own here.  

He managed to score some weed two years ago in what seems like a stroke of luck, when a friend of a friend (who he's no longer in contact with) got in touch with a dealer through her own connections (she was kind of slutty so she ""knew"" a lot of people).  Being new to the whole buyer/dealer relationship, he didn't get the guys number, but through an incredibly awkward exchange that involved finding him on Facebook and getting his number from there, did actually manage to get ahold of him again and buy some more.  However, once the guy had his number he felt uncomfortable as the guy would keep texting him asking him if ""he was good,"" and telling him about his supply for April 20th. I guess he had sort of a mailing list thing going on with all his contacts. My friend was afraid that someone else might see his phone messages and get him in trouble, and he just didn't like his dealer contacting him like that.  When my *friend* didn't answer because he  was considering getting clean to possibly look for a job, he never heard anything from the dealer again.  When he did finally work up the courage to call him a couple of months later, his number had been disconnected.  However, he knows the guy didn't get pinched because they're still ""friends"" on Facebook, and he can see his updates.  He doesn't really want to get in touch with that guy again, and he's pretty sure the dealer won't remember him anyway because they only met twice two years ago and he appeared to be blazed out of his mind both times.  However, he did supply my friend with some pretty dank master kush, so my friend does realize that this guy has some quality goods.  

He came very close over the summer when the boyfriend of the same friend from before tried contacting a dealer, but he didn't answer.  This person for some reason knows a lot of people who know drug dealers, however she doesn't smoke herself.  My friend doesn't talk to her much anymore because now she's dating a married man who is kind of douchey, and she's been acting pretty stuck up herself lately, so fuck her!  ..so says my friend.

Currently, my friend likes to drink every once in a while, but he gets a bit disheartened because he gets sick very easily from alcohol.  He pretty much refuses to drink unless it's a couple of hours before he intends to go to sleep, so that he can immediately sleep it off which still sometimes results in a slight hangover.  He likes how weed doesn't make him feel nauseous, and he also finds the act of smoking relaxing but doesn't want to smoke cigarettes because they taste nasty and he doesn't want to get addicted.  He feels that he doesn't have an addictive personality for things like alcohol or weed, so he feels more comfortable with the ganja.  He said that weed gives him an ""afterglow"" where, even when he's not high, he feels more motivation to do things with his life, where otherwise he suffers from a lack of motivation and alcohol has no such effect.  He said that he re-applied for college while he was smoking and felt inspired, but now he's back to feeling lost and wondering what he's doing with his life.  He's constantly overthinking and over analyzing everything, and he feels that smoking helps him calm down and see things in perspective.  He has a pipe just sitting in his drawer, that he bought back when he first started smoking that has been sitting there unused for two years now.  He's really itching to get back into things, but has no idea where to start.

If he were to say that he graduated from a school where someone with the same name graduated from, would this work? Is this any kind of fraud or identity theft? How much checking do employers do on people's education history, anyways? Do they do it at all? Could he get away with just fabricating his high school graduation altogether?

While 48k in it of itself is a relatively nice chunk of change, she is hesitant because of a number of reasons.
Firstly, this would not be her first job, but rather her first salary job. They are offering her the job because her previous work history consists of many different odd jobs that build up to the requirements of this job. The reason she is hesitant is because these odd jobs lead up to the potential of becoming a union member of said odd jobs, which would pay 55k minimum on the ultra low end or 78k-90k in the more realistic range. Note that these are not salary either, just the equivalent pay if it were salary. Benefits and all would be provided by the union so no difference there.
Another issue is that the salary job offer, when comparing the salary based on the title being given, other companies are offering much much more... something in the 90k range... however, it should be noted that these comparisons are only in job title as the companies offering this job title is not a direct competitor. Is it reasonable to compare the salary of say... a marketing manager at a marketing firm vs one at a company that has a dedicated marketing department? On one hand, they're completely different in that one deals with clientele who outsource their marketing to them while the other deals with only one company, however on the other hand, they have the same job title and functionally do the same thing. Perhaps the marketing manager at the firm deal with more complicated systems considering that they need the ability to have a wider range of functionality, but ultimately the job is the same and the approach to the job is the same.
My friend just doesnt want to walk into the job already resenting the company because she felt cheated or taken advantage of. That's a very bad mental environment for her to work in... and frankly for everyone else as well. She has already expressed her willingness to give it her all and work crazy OT hours if absolutely necessary even though salary doesnt pay OT. She feels that that kind of dedication would be a valuable asset for a company that deals with constant deadlines. She doesn't have a social life so she's cool with it, but she feels she should be adequately compensated for such a commitment. Her mentality is though that the amount she's willing to give to the company is at a higher value. She's willing to work at the 48k range but not at full capacity... only at 48k worth of capacity.
On the opposite end of it though, she is relatively in need of a job. Her odd jobs have been drying up slowly so the idea of having something stable is comforting.
So what do you guys think she should do? Should she counter and risk losing the opportunity? Should she outright reject because she's headed for a miserable life if she feels she got the shit end of the stick? Should she accept and just suck it up?

Zoom to last night and she and her best friend are all over friend 2, so he's like see sweet threesome, not thinking of first friend at all. walking back to our house friend 1 fucks off and leaves the women and friend 2 alone, eventually they move to his room, he tries it on with friend 1's girl but just plays a bit then has sex with her best mate instead while she passes out. 

Friend 1 walks into his room middle of the night calls him a cunt and disappears, friend 2 follows tries to calm and explain but cant get through turns our friend 1 really wanted to get with her and feels betrayed. Woke up this morning and the entire house hates friend 2 and he can't think of anyway to make it better knowing he fucked up. Friend 1 wont even listen to the truth calling it lies constantly.

Anyone know what can be done, friend 2 is already going to be moving out, with that amount of tension in the house he can no longer stay there.",,False,,t5_2vj9t,False,,,True,t3_1ht3gg,http://www.reddit.com/r/myfriendwantstoknow/comments/1ht3gg/mfwtk_how_to_make_it_up_to_another_friend_who/,
