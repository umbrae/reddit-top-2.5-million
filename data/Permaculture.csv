Hey there good people of Reddit. This is my project, been working on it for three years now, hoping that with your help it can reach the millions of people in the world who could use a little self built energy autonomy. Thanks.

..

The Solarflower is an open source solar energy collector which tracks the sun automatically through a simple non-electrical mechanism.

It can be made almost anywhere from common recycled and salvaged materials using basic tools and skills, is portable, has no running costs or emissions, and can produce up to kilowatts of power per device.

Depending on available resources it should take one to three unskilled people less than a week to build, and cost well under €$£ 100.

Potential examples of use could include:

~ Electrical production with simple steam turbine/piston, with waste heat going to oven or hot water system.

~ Dome oven with integrated water system for temperature regulation and hot/pasteurized water.

~ Steam distillation of water for removal of chemical, heavy metal, and biological toxins.

~ Medium to large scale food dehydration, processing, and roasting.

~ Conversion of fibrous organic waste into charcoal for energy storage and low smoke cooking, with coproduction of bio-oil and bio-gas.

~ And any other application utilizing heat.",,False,,t5_2qkib,False,,,True,t3_10f9h9,http://www.reddit.com/r/Permaculture/comments/10f9h9/solarflower_an_open_source_scrap_makeable_solar/,

&gt; 1. Roger Thurow: The Hungry Farmer - My Moment of Great Disruption&lt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQLBlRzEQGw&gt;
Thurow, author of The Last Hunger Season: A Year in an African Farm Community on the Brink of Change, explains the profound ""disease of the soul"" that hunger represents, and how empowering smallholder farmers can bring long-term sustainable health and hope to the people of Africa.

&gt; 2. Mark Bittman: What's Wrong with What We Eat&lt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YkNkscBEp0&gt;
Bittman, a food writer for The New York Times, examines how individual actions--namely food choices--contribute to both the detriment of the climate and long-term chronic health diseases. He suggests that we eat meat in moderation because agriculture is responsible for more greenhouse gas pollution than transportation.

&gt; 3. Anna Lappe: Marketing Food to Children&lt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bop3D7-dDM&gt;
Lappe, author of Diet for a Hot Planet: The Climate Crisis at the End of Your Fork and What You Can Do About It, questions whether multibillion dollar corporations should be marketing unhealthy foods to impressionable children, especially considering the numerous food-related health issues that are increasingly common among young people.

&gt; 4. Ellen Gustafson: Obesity + Hunger = 1 Global Food Issue&lt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7CtKDNf2RI&gt;
According to Food Tank co-founder Gustafson, the American food system has changed dramatically in the past 30 years; agriculture has been consolidated, new and cheap processed food have gained popularity, and U.S. agricultural aid abroad has decreased. These factors are major contributors to the current problem of one billion hungry and one billion overweight people on the planet.

&gt; 12. Carolyn Steel: How Food Shapes Our Cities&lt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLWRclarri0&gt;
Meat consumption and urbanism are rising hand-in-hand. Steel, an architect, explains how we got here by tracing how human settlements have fed themselves through time and, thus, shaped our cities. But in today's cities, our relationship with food is misshapen--it is disconnected. Steel suggests an alternative to urban design in which we use food as a tool to reconnect and interconnect.

Here, have some more Ted Talks.

The community is large and active and teeming with cool people and great ideas.  But then today I get an email telling me that I have to change my username to my real name or at least a real-sounding name.

Now, this may sound like an innocuous request, but it is not safe for me to use my real name online.  I have a stalker.  This person is frightening and possibly dangerous.  So that's quite simply not an option.

So then they say to make something up that sounds realistic.  Again, this seems like a simple enough thing to ask, but it's not really when you look closer.  First off, it's simply dishonest.  I don't like lying to people.  More importantly, if I ever actually want to try to form real-world connections with any member of the community I will have a problem.  I will not only have to tell this person that I've been misrepresenting myself, but I'll then need to explain why.  My stalker is not only a topic I'd really rather not discuss in general, it's also a really awkward and negative thing to introduce myself with to someone I've just met.

Of course, I explained my concerns to the moderator.  I thought that surely they'd understand that this was something of significance that they had overlooked.  But that was not the case.  Not only did they not find any merit in my concerns, they flatly refused to even discuss the matter with me.  They had laid down the law and that was that.

I indicated that I was disappointed that they were unwilling to work with me and attempted to change my username to John Doe.  I now find that I am unable to access my account.

I find all of this really quite absurd.  Permaculture is supposed to be about creating enduring culture.  That's not only about how we grow our food, but very much also about building better community.  This is a first-rate example of how to *not* create community.

So I guess I'll leave them to their fiefdom.  No matter how great the general population might be, I have no interest in belonging to something where the leaders treat people with such disrespect.

Genetically modified plants, that are resistant to fungicide ignores that as a permaculturist, I think there is good done by fungi. even pathogenic fungi has a purpose ecologically.

round up ready crops... just the concept... shows that the intention is to poison ANY other plants around. But in permaculture, we WANT other plants around... to improve production while lowering input. to create a system that is elastic, with a lot of different varieties of mutations to withstand future climate events, rain events, droughts. things that can evolve with the world around them AND provide us with food... healthy food without injecting a lot of chemicals into the cost side of the equation (in both labor, and cost of extraction and production of chemicals)

People in other places can be against GMO's for whatever reasons they want. justified... unjustified, it REALLY doesn't matter, because in a permaculture context, we're against that because it weakens our intentional ecosystem.

growing plants that are modified genetically is fine, even from a permaculture standpoint, as long as it

A: supports a functioning ecosystem

B: is useful in the functioning ecosystem (provides an ecosystem service) 

C: will last as an active member in the ecosystems community for generations and generations (unless it's more of a primary succession plant)

Comfrey is a plant that has a deep taproot and mines nutrients, namely potassium (which is good for fruit, flower, and seed production), from the deep soil layers. Some people shred their comfrey leaves up and steep them in water to make comfrey tea for their plants, some simply chop the plants up and bury them near other plants, some just plant them under their fruit trees and let them die off and come back and accumulate the soil while increasingly feeding the trees more nutrients over time. It's also supposed to grow pretty much anywhere.

It comes across to me as an essential plant for any organic gardener which is why I can't wait until I come across some. 

What I'm wondering is, are there any other plants like comfrey? Not necessarily plants that have deep taproots or even mine nutrients but  plants that are extremely beneficial to your garden, whether they restore the soil, or add good nutrients, or attract beneficial wildlife.

I'd really like to know as many as possible so I can get them going as early as I can. ",,False,,t5_2qkib,False,,,True,t3_1jjgb3,http://www.reddit.com/r/Permaculture/comments/1jjgb3/plants_that_everyone_should_have/,

and i started thinking about how google would actually view farming. the matrix of hunger, abundance and labor is a data distribution problem, really. so how do you bring the people to the food and vice versa?

imagine 20-50 small/tiny horticultural plots distributed across a town (or the google campus) ranging in size from a half acre down to a single plant or tree. each geotagged with data on what's what, when to harvest, processing and cooking instructions, a record of fertilization and weeding. 

make a mobile app that tells you what food is growing around you, planted by whom, maintained by whom, what food near you needs harvesting or weeding, gamify it obviously, leader boards for most food planted, most propogation, bonuses for importing new species and propogating successful plants, starting new plots, best weeder, most food given away...

make a distributed flagging/advertising system for help-needed requests, essentially food-available-for-work notices (instant 100% employment). 

the app design is a massive, google-sized project, but we'd also need to start with a substantial variety of plots started. tagging local public mature fruit trees is one easy step (theres a public-park food forest in asheville that would be perfect), also community gardens, but starting a couple-few dozen tiny 5x5 plots in public parks would be the perfect way to get the ball rolling. 

your standard row-crop agricultural model would perform poorly for this. what this would reward is distributed horticultural plants, perennial vegetables and herbs and food trees - permaculture essentially. plants that will take care of themselves pretty well, and give a bounty to the patient.

-------------------------------------

Larry Wall, the creator of the Perl computer programming language, identifies the chief virtues of a programmer as laziness, impatience, and hubris (and I, as a programmer, have plenty of all three).  I would say that laziness is also one of the chief virtues of permaculture.  The term ""permaculture"" comes from shortening ""permanent agriculture,"" or ""permanent culture,"" with the aim of creating an ecosystem that will outlast the designer.  (I can think of no greater state of laziness than being dead.)  The ideal permaculture design is one in which the only work that needs to be done is harvesting.  While the reality is that no design will completely eliminate human work, even if only to guide the progression of the ecosystem, the goal is to avoid as much work as possible.  Most of the heavy lifting, once the design is established, is done by nature.  For example, rather than spraying insecticides to kill crop-eating bugs, permaculture lures in beneficial organisms to control pests.  Rather than heavily fertilizing and tilling soil, permaculture uses the plants themselves, along with bacteria, fungi, worms, and bugs to build soil fertility.  Permaculturists also often enlist the aid of animals in order to till and fertilize the soil, to control weeds, and sometimes even to help harvest.  While traditional gardening is dominated by annuals, which must be planted (and in some cases transplanted) every year, permaculture places a greater emphasis on perennial and self-sowing plants.

Although the end goal is to avoid doing work, the necessity is that a lot of work must be done in planning and developing a permaculture design.  One must determine which plants are needed in order to fulfil the required functions.  The soil may need a jump start (especially if the soil had previously been abused), often through a technique known as sheet mulching, which can be very labour intensive.  However, the ultimate payoff is a garden that mostly cares for itself and that requires much less labour than conventional gardening (and maybe even less labour than going to the grocery store).

Another virtue of permaculture is greediness.  Permaculture tries to squeeze as much productivity out of the land as it can.  Conventional gardens grow individual crops in each location.  Meanwhile, forest gardening, one of the keystones of permaculture, aims to have seven layers of plants, all growing together (or possibly eight layers, if you take Stamets' advice of growing mushrooms).  Forest gardening attempts to mimic the way that forests grow in nature.  Forests are highly productive areas, requiring no input from humans to achieve such a high level of productivity.  While most people will think about the trees when thinking about a forest, the forest would not be as productive or as healthy without the shrubs, ground cover, flowers, and vines.  Permaculture also aims to reduce ""wasted"" space, such as paths for accessing the plants, using patterns such as keyhole beds.  Keyhole beds also encourage laziness: you can sit in the middle of a keyhole bed and harvest an array of crops around you.

Not satisfied with just demanding much from the land, permaculture expects much from plants as well.  Most gardeners will grow a plant for a single purpose, such as for ornamental, or edibility purposes.  However, a single plant can perform multiple functions, such as providing food, attracting or sustaining beneficial organisms, providing shade during hot summer days, providing shelter from cold winds, improving soil, providing beautiful flowers, providing fragrance, or providing wood for fuel or for crafts.  Permaculturists try to use plants for as many functions as they can provide.

A third virtue of permaculture is attention deficit.  Modern farming's monoculture is a permaculturist's nightmare.  Boooooring!  For permaculture, variety is king.  I think that my wife Amanda has lost count of the number of times that I've exclaimed, ""Hey, we should grow this plant too!""  It is not uncommon for permaculturists to cultivate over a hundred species of plants in a single garden.  Diversity improves the chances of survival.  While a monoculture can be wiped out by a single type of pest or by unusual weather, a diverse ecosystem is more resilient.  If one crop fails one year, other crops can take its place.  A diverse ecosystem is also less likely to attract devastating quantities of pests in the first place -- a monoculture looks like an all-you-can-eat buffet, while a garden with interplanted crops requires more work for the pests to travel between their favourite meals.  Furthermore, pest eaters may be lying in wait, having been initially attracted by their favourite snacks.  Having a diversity of plants can ensure that the pest eaters are around year-round: when one plant's flowering season is over, another plant can take over.

Similar to how hard work is required before laziness is allowed, a permaculture design must start with careful observation before the mind is allowed to wander.  Permaculture design starts with observing different aspects of the site for factors such as soil composition, sun and wind patterns, wildlife, water, et cetera, at various times of the day, and throughout the year.  Some permaculture experts suggest observing for a full year before doing any planting.  Observation informs the design, indicating, for example, where different plants need to go in order to take advantage of sun and shade, where barriers are needed, what soil alterations are needed, or what plant functions should be sought out.

I believe, then, that the chief virtues of permaculture are: laziness, greediness, and attention deficit.  Amanda suggested to rephrase them as: good time management, good stewardship of the land, and diversity, but I don't mind being called a lazy, greedy guy with a short attenti...

&gt;Agrichemical and pesticide makers like Monsanto, Bayer AG and Syngenta are also launching projects to study and counter colony collapse.

&gt;Few deny that pesticides - particularly a class of commonly used insecticides called neonicotinoids - can be harmful to bees in the laboratory. It is unclear what threat the insecticides pose under current agricultural usage. Some scientists say habitat decline and disease-carrying parasites, such as the Varroa mite, are the chief cause of bee deaths.

&gt;One of every three bites of food we consume depends on pollination by honeybees, but these overlooked contributors to our food system are continuing to die in stubbornly perplexing ways.

&gt;In 2006, beekeepers started noticing that bees were abandoning their hives, a phenomenon scientists dubbed Colony Collapse Disorder. Since then, the American bee population has dropped by an average of 30 percent every year, sending researchers, beekeepers and farmers into a head-scratching frenzy to figure out the cause.

[Study links insecticides to bee deaths](http://www.citynews.ca/2013/06/23/study-links-insecticides-to-bee-deaths/) (Quebec, Canada)

&gt;According to Jean-Pierre Chapleau, spokesman for the Quebec Beekeepers’ Federation, beekeepers want neonicotinoid insecticides banned.

&gt;“Neonicotinoid insecticides are overused,” he says.
Chapleau said that beekeepers don’t blame farmers, because they can’t buy seeds that have not been treated with insecticides even if they want to.

&gt;The industry says that’s not accurate.

&gt;SBA president Phil McAnespie said: “Last summer and autumn were very bad, which is obviously an issue and viruses are associated with that.
“I think most of the losses are down to the weather. Obviously, there is concern about neonicotinoids and there is ongoing research into that but I don’t think they have played any major part in this [the increase in bee deaths].”

I see a pattern, folks.

But how??",62,7,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/Permaculture/comments/1ehstn/just_got_possession_of_a_lot_in_brooklyn_ny_want/,"Hey everyone.  So I live in Brooklyn, NY and just got word of an open lot that I would like to start a permaculture garden in.  It's about 60' x 100' and gets pretty much full sun all day because the buildings around it aren't that tall.  It has a few raised beds and was minimally used for gardening last year but I want to expand that.  The rest is just dirt, and I haven't really check out the quality of the soil yet.  

Today is May 16th so I'm getting a late start, but I was wondering how you would approach this situation.  I would say my budget is about $300-$400.  All the tools I need are already there and there are some bags of garden soil and a compost pile already started. 

I would love to make it a permaculture garden that would become more and more stable over the years.  How would you approach this?  I'm going to scope it out more thoroughly this weekend and want to start planting next weekend.  So really I'm starting June 1st.  I can start seeding things this weekend in flats before transplant but other than that I'll probably have to get plants that are already started.  Which plants will do best going in the ground now going into the heat of the summer?

C'mon.

I shouldn't have to tell you this.

One of the most common criticisms of Monsanto is that they rarely comment about anything and have a very small public profile.  Farms that have been sued for seed-saving have never had any of their accusations answered publicly.  Discussions over Glysophate are routinely handled by anonymous PR departments with written statements.  Do you *really* think this is the sort of organization that would start a subreddit?

Really?  Okay, would they have started it without [mentioning it?](http://www.monsanto.com/Pages/results.aspx?k=Reddit)

It's a shame that all the accounts that moderated /r/monsantocompany have been deleted, because it was f'ing OBVIOUS it was a troll. /u/Monsanto_relations posted first in [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/11w3my/monsanto_tries_to_criminalize_saving_seeds_drags/) (since deleted).  Every comment they made had a name attached to it, but the name was never the same.  Chances are good it was banned as a preventive measure (the /r/conspiracy folx halfway convinced themselves that the names used were CIA!).  

[The author even gave away the bot.](http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/12k079/reddit_account_monsanto_relations_is_spreading/c6vpez5)  I mean, c'mon.  It's pretty clear someone was having fun with /r/conspiracy... but *you* guys are the ones that went and took it seriously and [let it out into the blogosphere.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Permaculture/comments/12nhub/monsantos_epic_pr_failure_on_reddit/)

At twenty-two years of age, I have been informed by my Grandfather that I am free to do 'whatever the hell you want, I don't give a shit' with an eighty-acre piece of land that he owns and will never sell. It is in the far west of Canada in a reasonably temperate climate which sees temperature highs of 30 C (86 F) in the summer and lows of -40C (-40F) in the winter, snow depths reaching 100cm (40 inches) some years, which experiences river flooding from snow melt in the spring, and has fairly dry summers. It is very close to logging country and is massively forested with a variety of trees ranging from poplar, aspen, paper birch, and maple, to spruce, douglas fir, and pine. The area is also dotted densely with small lakes and streams.

I have been gifted by my mother with a small travel trailer (22ft) which has a propane-powered stove and refrigerator, and my father will be moving it to the property for me.
Things I need to do when I get there, right away, include digging a well, tilling up the soil, clearing land, and milling wood for structures.

What should I plant? What should I plan for? What can anybody tell me about keeping sheep, chickens, and rabbits?

Help me, /r/permaculture. You're my only hope. (I could also use suggestions for where to crosspost this)

Edit : You guys are so cool! Thank you so much for all this.

Edit 2 : It will be at least a year until I'm ready to build a commune, because I need to build the main house first. Also, there are requirements! 

1. Canadian citizen or permanent resident. I don't need to have my door kicked in for harboring illegal immigrants.
2. No illegal drugs! Whether or not drugs SHOULD be illegal or not (I think they shouldn't) is a moot point - I don't want the cops having ANY REASON to crack down on us.
3. No excessive drinking! This is a common-sense aspect - alcoholics aren't the best workers and we all need to be giving 100%.
4. Team spirit! When you create a community, you have to be always thinking of the other people in your community. Don't confuse independence with being an asshole.
5. No preaching. This won't ever be a 'spiritual community'. Keep your religion - and your philosophy - to yourself, or at least keep it to friendly debate.

Okay, there's probably more but I don't want to make this into a huge post.

how'd you start?

Did you plan your paths first or after maturity?

And I have to say some of you drive me crazy with your lack of awareness of invasive/exotic species. In the last couple days I've seen articles and comments recommending several seriously invasive species - Phragmites, Bahia grass, Exotic honeysuckles, Climbing Ferns and some more and from the point of view of a guy who's had to burn, hack and spray hundreds upon hundreds of acres of just these plants, it's really frustrating to see advocates of sustainability promote them.

If you want to make sure you're doing things responsibility simply google the plant and the state you live in. If it comes up as an invasive run. If there's no articles whatsoever...plant with extreme caution. Generally if a plant acts in an invasive manner there will be an article about it, however, you don't want to be the guy who introduced a new invasive to the country. So if you find an article saying it grows well and in a non-invasive way in your area or similar ecosystems, go right ahead.

Finally, I'd like to say you can trust your local guy at the nursery. However, the nursery business is really the bane of the conservationists existence. It's a business dependent on them providing plants that people enjoy, kind of regardless of its effect on local environs. Some are ethical, most are just clueless.

Edit: There's a troll on this thread named aletoledo. In the course of this thread he's stated he doesn't believe in species being invasive, that any ecosystem impacted by humanity isn't worth saving from invasives and that there's no worth in native species.

More technology, more medicine, more government, more this, and more that.  We've somehow come to the belief that more is equivalent to forward, to progress, to better.  But once ""more"" becomes excessive (which we have long, long since passed), all of these so-called solutions only move the problems around and multiply them in the process.  So our first examination when confronted with a problem should not be what could be added to fix it, but rather what could be taken away.  What there should be less of.

This may seem quite obvious to those of us interested in permaculture and its related disciplines, but I routinely see this same dynamic among our ranks.  It's typically hidden behind a mask of ""better"", particularly in the realm of technology.  There is constant talk of this material or that technique which promises to reduce our woes.  And undoubtedly most of the time this additional technology is less damaging than the previous technology.  But it's still more technology.  Which means more mining non-renewable resources.  Which means more polluting and dehumanizing factories.  Which means more large-scale, hyper-centralized social structure.  And so on and so on.

No amount of more of something will solve the problem of there being too much of it to begin with, regardless of how ""improved"" it is.  We must learn how to solve our problems by not creating them to begin with.  We must learn how to give up things we want in exchange for things we need.

Whenever we log a woods, we go in and plant valuable trees. We've also converted 2 fields that we didn't want to farm anymore - one is black walnuts and white pine, the other is all sugar maple. 

I'm just starting to learn more about forest gardening. Our land is already full of black walnuts, shagbark hickories, oaks, and apple trees. We have some stagnent field and a few small clearcuts that I plan on creating more of a forest garden rather than plantation this year - still researching how exactly I want to do it.

So doing this can make the land better at growing food than a corn field, but how can I make it more profitable than a corn field? How can I financially justify turning more field into a food forest? Is there a way I can replace some of the corn or soy that I buy with something I can grow in the woods?

1355857144.0,43,self.Permaculture,152bj3,A report on what happens when you don't use soap for 6 months: awesomeness,52,9,110,http://www.reddit.com/r/Permaculture/comments/152bj3/a_report_on_what_happens_when_you_dont_use_soap/,"A household of two adult men and two young girls (4 and 6) switches to daily showering using no soap. Water baths only. The experiment was done to explore the necessity of covering our bodies with complex detergents, moisturizers, fragrances, etc. Quick summary: amazingly, you need virtually no soap. Deodorant and rare hair conditioner remain useful.

Subjects: two adult males with lots of body hair. Head hair varies from 1/4 inch to 1 inch in length (short). Two young girls (4 and 6) with long hair (1 foot  and over in length).

Previous products: Dove moisturizing soap, unscented, was used previously on all skin. Shampoo was used on the men, and shampoo and conditioner on the young girls to help detangle their hair.

Procedure: Water showers were taken with warm/hot water. Thorough finger scrubbing of the head hair was performed in the direct beam, both serving to clean fingernails and exfoliate the scalp of any dandruff or dirt. Hands were then rubbed over the face to assist in the removal of any excess oil or grime. Groin, rear, and armpits were aggressively rubbed in the water until no detectable smell remained (rather quickly). Young girls followed a similar, albeit faster method since they have virtually no odor-creating regions. Shower water from a hand spray was used to direct the beam to business regions. Note: one of the adult males has perpetually dry skin and thick, rough elbows and knuckles. One of the adult men has oily skin that is soft and smooth but tends towards acne. One of the girls has eczema on the back of her legs that only responds to vaseline.

Initial results from absolutely zero soap use: For the men, the results were nothing short of miraculous.

Adult 1: The dry skin of one adult was significantly improved, with the fine white powder and roughness of his elbows changing to peel off dead skin in sheets for a few weeks instead, then changing again until the dry skin was significantly reduced without skin peeling. Groin smell was virtually eliminated: the cheesy smell of sweat after a day's work was replaced with a much more gentle, musky, inoffensive odor. Body smell was near nonexistent. Hair was not heavy or oily but rather surprisingly normal.

Adult male 2: Similar results, this subject's oily skin did assert itself slightly more without regular detergent application. However, the daily hand rubbing in the water shower has yet yielded no acne. Body smell is significantly reduced.

Adult male together: Deodorant is still required, as armpits are designed to generate significant smell. However, a single application of deodorant is sufficient to last for two days for light effort days such as an office job. The groin smell reduction was unexpected and remarkable, and the entire nether region is clearly healthier, less moist, and less cheesy than ever before. I suspect preserving the natural oil boundary of the skin is permitting an improved loss of moisture during the way, as well as preserving an oil coating over the hair.

Young girls: Their long hair can go for one or two days using only water for cleaning quite well. Dirt and occasional food washes out easily and completely. ""Frizz"" and ""fly away"" hair is aided greatly by the natural oils that build up on the hair without leaving the hair greasy or oily. Remarkably no body odor of any kind; water is truly enough for them at this age. Once every three days, conditioner is worked into their hair and any tangles brushed out in the shower, then rinsed, as their hair is very fine and prone to tangling. I have tried vinegar and other options, but so far it really does need the slickness of conditioner in the shower to prevent matt forming.

Final comments:
This has been a staggering discovery. I have always wondered if we really need the plethora of products sold to us as ""necessities."" The answer clearly no. We do use soap to wash our hands if we touch anything dirty (after using the toilet is basically it). We use deodorant for the adults. We use some conditioner from time to time for the girls hair. Our bodies are otherwise free of all soap, all shampoo, etc. It's remarkably easy for travel, not having to bring your own or worry about their inferior brands. Save a lot of money. And worry a lot less about what all these chemicals are doing to us in the long term. The reduction of groin odor was nothing short of miraculous.

Desires and further research:
It would be really nice to find a more natural way to deal with armpit odor and a less chemically complex conditioner for the girls' hair. (Tested) advice is welcome! Vinegar did change their hair very slightly, but it's not a detangler, and it's extremely stingy to their little eyes.

Her and her partner produce approximately 3 buckets a week.  The bulk of which is old sawdust and urine.   She has 5 buckets she rotates.  Once 4 are full and the 5th is in use then the pile gets managed.  This happens about every 10 days.  

Here's her overall setup.

Two bins, a work station, a sink to collect rain water/wash your hands in and lots of buckets.    The bins are lined with old carpet/rug and cardboard to prevent material from falling out.  

Here's the active bin.   It's covered with shredded paper.   A local office saves all their shredded paper for her.

A local restaurant saves all their food scraps for them and this goes into the mix (some of it gets fed to her worms too).  
http://i.imgur.com/W5iCC.jpg  

Here's what the toilet buckets look like (no poop visible).  All you can see is sawdust and urine.    
http://i.imgur.com/7OvGY.jpg     
http://i.imgur.com/darc8.jpg      

The buckets go into the pile, then it gets covered with the veggie &amp; kitchen scraps.    
http://i.imgur.com/PRTai.jpg     

That in turn gets covered with horse manure, which I trade to her for home grown garlic, herbs and spices.   
http://i.imgur.com/FJby5.jpg  

That in turn, gets covered with a layer of old rotten hay.  She also uses shredded paper, leaves, weeds or whatever is handy.   
http://i.imgur.com/cJwRF.jpg    

This then gets covered to protect it from too much rain, although she lets it rain on it some but not enough to flood it.

Here's the ground behind it, as you can see, no leakage.  
http://i.imgur.com/z3ES1.jpg  

In the event of a catastrophic failure she created a large berm just downhill of the pile(s) created from downed trees and leaves.   

It takes them about 3 months to fill a bin and then it's allowed to age for 2 years before it gets used as compost in and around their yard.  

Within 12 hours of applying this mixture temperatures spike to about 130 degrees and stay there for about 3 days then slowly dwindle to about 90 degrees after 10 days.    

&gt;Complete pathogen destruction is guaranteed by arriving at a
temperature of(143.6F) for one hour, (122F) for one day,(114F) for one week or (109F) for one month. It appears that no excreted pathogen can survive a temperature of (1490F) for more than a few minutes. A compost pile containing entrapped oxygen may rapidly rise to a temperature of(131F)or above, or will maintain a temperature hot enough for a long enough period of time to destroy human pathogens beyond a detectable level . As pathogen destruction is aided by microbial diversity, as discussed in Chapter 3, excessively heating a
compost pile, such as by forcing air through it, can be counter-pro
ductive.

1312088052.0,44,self.Permaculture,j4mnu,I was fortunate enough to inherit 100 acres and I started farming.  How should I move forward to integrate permaculture principles into my situation?,53,9,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/Permaculture/comments/j4mnu/i_was_fortunate_enough_to_inherit_100_acres_and_i/,"In 2009 I was asked to take on responsibility for the family farm.  That year I started a small vegetable garden and most of it was eaten when it was at the seedling stage.  At the same time I worked at another farm that was starting a CSA.  In 2010 I decided to make my farm land productive and converted an acre and a half hay field into a vegetable plot and started my own 32 member CSA program.  It was a great experience, but my inexperience as a grower was shining through and I didn't provide the quality that I wanted.  I prepared during the offseason creating a good garden plan.  For season two the garden has been better in a lot of ways but I still feel like my inexperience and lack of formal training is keeping me from doing as good as I want.  We are supplementing some vegetables from other local producers.  My customers are happy though!

I can't imagine expanding any larger than the 1.5 acres of annuals right now.  It is more than enough for me to handle.  I've realized that if I want to reach the production potential of the farm I need to take a different approach.  Perennials like fruit bushes, fruit trees, and nut trees would allow me to make more land productive while decreasing all the labor involved with growing and planting annuals.  I've also thought of integrating animals workers into the plan.  I raised a small flock of chickens and turkeys this year.

I feel like I've done a good job growing on self education alone, but I don't plan on continuing the CSA next year and instead enrolling in a program that will give me the necessary skills to realize my potential as a farmer and of the farm.  My dream is to create a sustainable farm that others can learn from.  I found a sustainable food and farming degree offered at the state college that looked awesome.  I've also seen a few permaculture courses but nothing that looks like what I'm looking for.  I'm going to NOFA on Aug. 12th and look forward to the permaculture courses.  Especially the class talking about a fruit and nut CSA.

Stats:
 
Age - 25

Land - 100 acres

- 1.5 in vegetables 
- 23.5 in hay fields (which I want to incrementally convert to food production)
- 70 in forest (which I want to sustainably harvest firewood)
- 5 in marshland

Equipment and Infrastructure available:

- Tractor with front-end loader and backhoe
- Rototiller, brush hog, manure spreader, and haying equipment attachments.
- Barn that housed a small herd of beef cows(6-10) and hay.
- Shed to protect equipment.
- Garage and wood shop.
- River that I irrigate from

History:

I grew up on a farm that produced hay and pecans.  I helped my Grandmother in her small vegetable plot.  I studied exercise science in college.  I was a personal trainer but found little satisfaction or job opportunities.  I was asked to take on the farm and was inspired to make it productive and haven't looked back.  I read a lot to prepare and attend conferences regularly.  I like the challenge and satisfaction that growing food presents.  I've learned I need to learn a lot more and take a different approach to be successful.  My parents aren't supportive and suggest I get a 40 hour a week job and farm on the side.  I have a tent in the garden that I've been sleeping in to get an early start and see the sun rise.

Does anyone want to do some sort of activity like that within our reddit? Like maybe someone will post a picture from google earth, and then we all take that picture and see what we could theoretically do with it (maybe draw in things in MS paint or photoshop or whatever) and then compare them at the end of a set time. Someone might take it and make a food forest out of it, and someone else might devote a large part to restoring natives, etc. It might go in a million different directions. It could be really neat to see what we all come up with and then when it comes time for us to actually design a permaculture system, we'll have a little (theoretical) practice. 

For those of us who don't actually have much land to do things with, it's one way to practice so that in the mean time we're not just watching permaculture youtube videos. Just something to give us a little practice. We could change it so that one time we'll have to design a desert system, another time could be a prairie, etc.

(Cleanup and removal of debris in progress.). 


Climate zone: 6B.

Growing grass presently and various trees.   

Topography Map:   http://i.imgur.com/ozqAxJQ.jpg. 
(The blue dot is where I have reliable Internet, the area I'll be setting up in will be slightly NE in a line by the red double dashes to indicate our dirt road. The large divot just north of the blue dot, according to local lore, was a meteor impact site but I have been unable to confirm this.)

No present water features.  
Average Rainfall: 44.1 inches.  


No legal restrictions for rainwater collection, livestock. I'm not sure what other restrictions are worth noting.  


Solar Orientation report from University of Oregon site:

Soil Conditions: Extremely Rocky and no other testing or evaluation performed.  


Site was wooded area until 10 years ago when it was cleared for the present structures. 

==========================


With all that out of the way, my initial thoughts:  


Outside - Backyard


I plan to add a rainwater collection system. Not anything super fancy, a filter at the drain and a hose to collect the water coming off the downspout into a series of food grade barrels that will be dedicated to rainwater only.  


I have also considered harvesting water in some way that typically would run off the ledge just past the tree line. However, I don't know how best to do that.  


I will be creating an area for gardening outside the back fence that will run the length of the fence, potentially more. A portion of it initially will be a hoop or tunnel house, to allow harvest later into the year. Later, an actual greenhouse structure will be added.  


I feel more trees and shrubs should be planted in the backyard and likely some berry bushes of some sort. I will research more prevalent floral additions that thrive in my area. I will be planting bamboo at one corner and will harvest it at various lengths, dry it properly and use them in the garden and for fishing poles. There is a stocked pond nearby I have access to.  


We have all manner of wildlife that we frequently see, deer, turkey, fish (stocked pond) Etc. I have some neighbors that will let me barter for some of their goats and chickens.  


I have an order in to our local lumber yard for some cedar and will be building 3 3x3 compost heaps. There is also a large compost drum that has the handle to turn it and it's in good shape.  


There is a play structure (and the bright yellow slide is still visible in the picture) that I plan to remove and free cycle to someone or donate as it won't be useful.  


Outside - Front yard. 

Addition of more trees, bushes and local floral types. Removal of a handicapped ramp and construction of stairs from the removed ramp.  


I want it presentable out front but no idea in how to make that happen inside the fencing.  


There is one neighbor nearby, who wants to see the area taken care of but has mentioned help would be limited. There's also a building being used as a barn for various storage next to them.  


Inside. 


There is gas, electric, sewer and water. I just have to go sign all that over soon. The stove and hot water heater are propane. Inside is an electric Fridge and large chest freezer.  


How am I doing so far? I welcome any and all questions, comments and concerns.

I'm funding the project and if anyone wants to contribute, feel free. I'm not asking for donations because of the unethical people who beg, scam and steal via the Internet and I don't expect more than your information and feedback. I'll buy a domain and I will set up a github, bitbucket, Google Code and self-hosted SVN respositories as well as a main web site for this project.

I am taking ownership of ideas tossed around here and several forums so that we can get something accomplished. I'm not asking you to contribute information, I'm begging and telling you to contribute because this will be a one-of-a-kind software and we want it to the best it possibly can be. This includes links to wikis, scraped data and guides on farming, ideas for cheap greenhouses and do-able alternative energy sources (biogas, diesel storage, gasoline storage, wind power, solar power).

We need a meals calculator: how much livestock and farmed food, herb and other materials needs to be produced food per person at 3 meals a day plus three snacks per day.

We need a profit calculator: how much of X crop or X eggs need to be produced to make a profit, with the currency, sell price, gross and net values variable based upon custom input information as well as templated.

We need a land calculator: how much of X livestock can be put into X square feet or X acres of land with what method (stacking chicken coops for instance or growing stacked podponics or hydroponic units versus standard planting into soil.) and more.

I want all ideas that would be useful and work on a web (php and html5) and mobile (android and apple embedded devices, as well as limited WAP use) devices.

Other solutions, both commercial, free or open source are useless for all of our needs. I aim to have that fixed. They are either limited (useful for one thing only), cost too much money or are very ugly to deal with (and not mobile).

Here's a general idea so far, not including what's in the reddit threads below.:

Homestead / farming / ranching / garden / land planning and development (and upkeep) estimation (for materials lists, costs, and more) and design software. With a few $1,000+ plugins it's possible to do some of it with $3,000's worth of AutoDesk Software but what's out there is either a) useful for one task or b) cheap and contributed to by one person who does it out of the kindness of their heart but has no time and thus completely lacks features and or costs $50 to $200.
There's nothing but high-priced solutions and open source solutions just don't get enough drive behind them to get a great project going.
Here's a few people (including myself in one of the threads) talking about it. The main things needed are a) web app b) mobile app integration (with to do checklist type function) c) spreadsheet-math integrated templating system for various jobs, materials and cost estimation d) reminders of tasks needing to be done or on to do list. Much of that I know can be done piecemeal with free software but not much can be done all in one place and overall, to do all the tasks needed, it's more challenging of a problem than most people will do and thus do without.

Ideas for plugins or features include a botanical database for food crops, other crops, herbs, trees (for wood resources and fruit harvesting), pest management, tracking egg production in fowl ranching, cheap tracking of tagged livestock (cattle, etc) with a DIY solution, At-Home or On-Site weather station data scraping, a Knowledge-Base for primers or walkthroughs for various tasks if someone forgets it (that will be community built) including animal disease management, hazardous chemicals, plants and animal guides.
Our aim is to create a free piece of software with some pieces of the software being open source to allow modification and development of plugins and to plug-in to existing frameworks such as wikis.
Essentially, we need a web application in HTML5 and PHP so that it is compatible with all recent browsers and also some embedded devices such as Android and Apple devices.

We want to be able to design (graphically like a CAD program), including importing images for us (even if to be traced over in our CAD). We want to be able to estimate materials needed and cost.
We want to be able to estimate amount of water needed and have cut and paste irrigation and watering methods.

We want to be able to use data that's been imported and publish it so that others can use it too (crop planting information for instructions and CAD, including spacing, irrigation, crops OK to plant near one another, pests in a given geographic area, weather in a geographic area, etc).

We want to be able to scrape data from CSV and put it in a database.
The former threads relevant to this are here:

[4] http://www.reddit.com/r/homestead/comments/jy70m/good_management_software_for_livestock/

I'll lay out some more information here later, including links to the repositories and an updated-daily (if I have time each day) feature request list, information sources to be scraped (copied and compiled / collated) and progress notes.

Again, anyone who wants to contribute may do so. I guarantee that your information or work will be published and stay published but I don't guarantee it will be open source.

I'm also going to post this elsewhere to gain as much momentum with it as is possible for me to do. I look forward to your submissions and feedback.

TL;DR: Submit information sources, suggestions for features and any help you want to offer here, to my e-mail address ([5] survive2@yahoo.com) or this Google Docs Form linked below. Keep it limited to constructive criticism or at least semi-relevant posts please.

One idea I saw in the spring issue of *permaculture* was a specific tech for understanding soil state, but it wasn't really explored more than just a one-liner.

Some of you may have seen my little [garden](http://imgur.com/a/LGqVY) move along over the past 2 years and I was reviewing a few photos and wanted to show a stark contrast between then and now.

We have had floods and the worst temperatures and drought in recorded history, yet the garden endures through it with little to no care. While it isn't overly productive, these are fruit trees that will need a few years for maturity.

The second photo is zoomed out a little from the first. Those 3 mounds make up the middle of it. I can only spot one tree from the rightmost mound, the Acerola Cherry, the others are hidden.

Yes, it isn't productive yet. It's no Geoff Lawton-style victory or scope, but it is a beginning in a bare suburb. But wow, I get a lot of satisfaction from sensing the life contained within, above and below ground.

Luckily they don't jump (as I hear deer do) so the fence doesn't have to be too high.  I've been exploring some different options and I always come back to the idea of a living fence.  But, before I get started, I want to see what the brilliant minds of r/permaculture have to say.   
My prerequisites for the fence are: 

1) Easily/quickly established (Ultimately I'll need about 500 ft).

2) Easily grown from cuttings.

3) Dual purpose. 

4) Longevity and relatively ease of management.  


Anyone have suggestions/resources for living fences?  I'm in Hawai'i around zone 10, but I'm at the base of a mountain and get relatively cooler weather and lots of rain. While I can basically grow all tropical plants, I have grown some cooler weather varieties that you rarely see in Hawai'i (blueberries and white clover).  My limited research and criteria has landed me at one plant: gliricidia.  Anyone have experience with living fences?  Or with gliricida in particular?  Pros? Cons?

Thank you in advance.

Almost stereotypical actually, from the outsiders point of view.
Im fat, im unmotivated to do any character-building work, i work a job which i have the greatest of disdains for, and generally am unhappy with the state of my surroundings, and in turn, the world. 
Id like to also state that i seem to border on having some form of attention lapsing issue where i cant even sit for a moment to meditate. Numerous times would i sit down to focus myself, but the moment i feel a rush of relaxation roll over me, i need to get up, frustrated.

I want to turn it all around.

I would love to say that ive had a shift in my consciousness, but really i believe that i just realized that there is something very wrong in the world and how we live in it. 
Greed, above all, is my most apparent of this worlds evils.
Every thing from hunger, to hate, to pride, as i understand, branches from it. 

I wish to cut myself from this circle of consuming, to becoming a productive member of society, all the while producing the sustenance to thrive in a place where the equation to the question: 'why are we here?' is balanced.

Id love to have an aquaponics setup set up and be able to feed (and if large enough, clothe) my parents and siblings, but i have no clue as to where to start.

Any help or ideas brought my way would only regarded as a loving gesture. As we inherently do not wish to see harm done to one another.

The only thing I'd also add is probably a swale along the contour at the north-eastern side of the land to encourage penetration of water and to catch run-off from the house and divert it along the land.

Our needs are pretty basic. It should eventually be able to support a family of four, hopefully all our electricity and heat, food and a much water as possible (there is mains water too so that's not the biggest issue).

The weather is semi-continental, cold winters, and good summers. Annual rainfall about 2000mm, sunshine hours 1900. Land is located in hamlet, surrounded by forest and pasture land. Moderately hilly. Slightly acidic soil with average drainage.

Unfortunately, my lab for experimenting is limited to my mom's very suburban backyard, and she is more concerned with it's aesthetics than with it's actual function. However, food prices have even her thinking about how we're going to feed ourselves in the future, and she's about as open as she's likely to be to me planting random crops in her perfectly manicured ""garden"" (which currently produces a few oranges and several pounds of rosemary in a year). But she's got a big yard, and I think if I can actually produce a significant amount of food, prospects for expansion will be good.
   
This being said, I have no experience to match my enthusiasm. I'm not even sure where to begin to start. How do I go about understanding what to plant here? Where do I learn what crops will work together? How do I know what water delivery system will be most effective? I'm in a VERY insular suburb, and the nearest operation that even calls itself permaculture is a ways off, and I doubt they'd have much interest in helping turn a private backyard into something productive.

We recently purchased some land in Western Texas to begin our sustainable permaculture project. It is in the desert, so we are going for the toughest terrain we could find in an attempt to turn it into a lush, green oasis. Currently we have 3 people camping there. They will begin construction on several cob homes, digging a rainwater encatchment basin, and planting black locust trees along with a variety of other vegetation.

We are building a 10m x 5m polytunnel.  We will use a double skin.  We will also have one long side stacked with painted black barrels filled with water to provide some thermal mass.

If we wanted to keep the temperature at a reasonable level during the night, good for plants and some fish that will also be in here (It is a hobby farm aquaponics system) how many chickens do you think would be needed to actually make a noticeable difference to temperature?

We're a young couple with new hopes for a permaculture operation in our small Southern Indian backyard. The climate is very hot and coastal. We have about 20 coconut trees and 5 miscellaneous fruit trees (papaya, guava, etc). There's also a small in-ground cement pond of about 3 foot radius. This we're hoping to use for floating edible greens (any suggestions?) and the fish waste for compost or fertilizer. We'd like to raise about four chickens for eggs, and somehow use these chickens for permaculture in our garden (without letting them eat all of our crops!). The rear face of the property terminates with a small swamp in which many monitor lizards, snakes, and other creatures live (could these be used somehow for permaculture?). As a side note, there's a dog kennel on the property.

Our plans right now are very tentative, so we're looking for any and all suggestions/criticism. We're looking into a 20'x20' chicken-wired area (to keep the neighborhood pigs and dogs out) with an open area against the swamp so the lizards/snakes can come into the garden. Within the fenced area will be a smaller compartment in which the chicken coop is. That way, we can let the chickens roam in the garden when we want to and make sure they don't eat our vital crops. We wanted to use a mixture of chicken waste, fish waste, food waste, and human urine to compost/fertilize (any tips on this?). 

more details on the swamp: it is shared by the community. we don't want to use the water from it directly because it is slightly polluted from a nearby light industry operation. the total square footage of the water is probably about 1750. the swamp's natural foliage is rather thick and is generally on the other sides of the swamp.

For plantables, we're looking at running tomatoes and green beans up the chicken wire. On the ground, we'd put things like cucumbers, squash, pumpkins (the edible kind, not the jack-o-lantern kind), yams/potatoes... Any other thoughts?

1363274102.0,28,self.Permaculture,1aad85,I'm in the market for land and need help considering a good ratio of pasture-forest-water resources for a new property,30,2,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/Permaculture/comments/1aad85/im_in_the_market_for_land_and_need_help/,"Right now, my boyfriend and I live on an acre and we're currently establishing phase one of our first permaculture project. We are in the market for an expansion, however, and are looking to purchase land in the Blue Ridge area of Georgia. The scale we're considering is 10-15 acres. Eventually, I'd like to have the ability to grow a very small community on the land and establish a public community center, if we so choose. 

So here's my question. Pasture is much more expensive than raw forest land. But, that's obviously because clearing pasture is difficult and expensive. Considering my long-term goals, how important is having pasture and how difficult, really, is it to clear yourself? What are the things we should consider when deciding on a ratio of pasture to raw land in a potential purchase? Additionally, what types of water resources should we look for and be wary of (in addition to a flood plain consideration)?

Thanks for any help you can give! Sorry this question is so poorly explained. Feel free to ask clarifying questions.",,False,,t5_2qkib,False,,,True,t3_1aad85,http://www.reddit.com/r/Permaculture/comments/1aad85/im_in_the_market_for_land_and_need_help/,

So, I want to get started and hoped that you guys might have some time to help me make a plan.

So we have a roughly 25' square piece of land with some fruit trees on it already. I'd like to prepare some of our current grass area for a garden (roughly 12' x 8', plus the corner). We have kids and the grass is used quite a bit, otherwise I'd use the whole yard. I hope to use this little plot to show my neighbors how it is done and convince them to use part of our common space for permaculture. It's a much larger space and underused presently. You can see it on the larger map. It's on a slight hill.

More information: we're in Lund, Sweden, pretty mild but on some climate maps it looks roughly equivalent to the northeast of the US. I'm from USA and wife is Swedish. We may settle down permanently here or the States eventually on a bigger plot. I will be getting some books when I get back to the States, but if anyone has some ideas for a productive use of this space, I'd love to hear from you. Thanks!

Questions:
Is this piece too small to do some sort of berm or swale?
Should I just start dumping biomass on there now over the fall and winter and start in Spring?

To be clear, Im talking about staking down the thing (looking at a 60'x30') to one spot for about a month. Its still getting into the 80's here, so I foresee some pretty heavy solar effects.

The story is really about the characters and the challenges they face, but I want it to be as authentic as possible concerning permaculture. Not only to immerse my readers in the story, but also to highlight a practical, sustainable way to live right now in our non-apocalyptic world. 

Here's the scenario: Most of the world's population is killed in a global pandemic (like 99.5+%). Government collapses, civilization as we know it comes to an end. Though the book is set 15-20 years in the future, the pandemic would be happening about now in that universe. Also, global climate change will still be a factor. 

Anyway, on to the questions:

* How many hours a day would each person need to 'work' to maintain a typical permaculture set up for 10-20 people? How much time do you put in on your homestead?

* What do you think would be the biggest challenges with permaculture considering the lack of infrastructure (and of course the internet)?

* What are some companion plants you use on your homestead? How are they interconnected?

* Where would your ideal post-apocalyptic permaculture commune be? 

If you don't feel like answering those questions, just tell me about your permaculture homestead or the one you hope to have someday. Any sort of input would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!

Permasteading - A modernized homesteading act

**Abstract**

A government stimulus that creates real physical assets and livelihood. Using BLM land or purchased wilderness, lottery off lots to the poorest people (only those fit to do this etc) with stipulations. The stipulations would include living by a certain permaculture* farm based lifestyle. For example if a 5 acre plot were given to a family, they could clear no more than 1 acre to live on, and could only harvest sustainably from the rest. Appoint the family to be sort of keepers of their little section of wilderness.

*I am going to define permaculture as an organic, sustainable** ecosystem that supports a large biodiversity, but has a primary focus on human needs.

**I am defining sustainable as any system that produces more that it consumes and produces enough to replace itself within its lifespan.

**Shelter**

The houses on the sites would be far off grid, so building codes should be a non-issue. Construct them to be net zero carbon emissions houses. Utilize a small solar grid for simple living that can easily be expanded to suit increased energy demands. I look to the original Earthships, 'the hut', and similar designs. They are extremely low cost and require no skill or heavy machinery to build (though a back hoe is nice). With a small investment of ~2500USD a couple could be living in a regulated climate year round, harvesting rain as the water source, and be growing plenty of food for themselves in just an hour or 2 a day in the garden.  Another hour in the garden leads to overabundance. A few thousand dollars more should get you a nice solar PV or wind generator setup. From there you are literally disconnected from the grid and still have many of the amenities we've grown accustom to having.

Since you start with the most impoverished people in the country, when you assist them you will undoubtedly remove their need for assistance from more typical programs. For example a household of 4 on welfare could be eating up thousands of dollars in resources month-in and month-out, but never seeing any improvements. Instead of providing shelter allowances for this family, use the money to build the initial Earthship. For a family of four you'll want at least 3 rooms. 2 bedrooms and a communal living area/bathroom. Remember, this is going to be less than extravagant, but once the family is settled they can expand the house. Construction costs to make this perfectly livable, and by most countries poor standards, amazing, Earthship and add in a small solar PV or wind setup should cost in the range of 10-15kUSD, retail. The government should be getting a nice bulk discount with those economics of scale working for them. So now you've invested all that money into a solid real world physical asset that will last for generations and can be updated/expanded as desired. You also no longer have the welfare housing cost. 

**Food**

After the first  year, the family should be competent enough in living on the land that they should be producing plenty of food. Another reduction in welfare costs. I am sure many people would be fully competent in basic gardening day 1, or with a little refresher course. A bi-weekly bus could provide a chance for the families of the new permasteads to commute to town to buy food while they are getting established. The buses could easily be replaced by private trucks the communities would use to travel. This would be be useful once production reached a point where you had to haul produce to a farmer's market.

**Economy and Climate Change**

Now you have  a load of people that used to cost the government money every month, producing at least enough organic produce to feed themselves and most likely are producing it in such abundance that they can sell their extra crops locally. This reduces the strain on the global network of food production and transportation. People will get healthier food and cost would likely trend down with the increase of producers in the market.

One of the more interesting occurrences that could be nurtured in a plan like this is attacking climate change at the same time while using no extra resources than providing a new life for all those people. The permasteads should be positioned to allow several families to reside in one area to allow for smaller communities to develop and reduce transportation needs even further. The simple bi-weekly bus gives people a chance to get to town for things they could not easily produce. Milk, cheese, etc. This could be reduced further if the communities worked together to produce a sum greater than the parts. For example one family could focus on dairy production, one could focus on vegetables, another pigs and chickens for eggs and meat, and so on. Each of these permasteads could provide something that all of the other ones benefited from. All isolated in their own local economy. No need to worry about money when giving food to your neighbors if they are always giving you food. 

Now this minor reduction in transportation is nice, but the real meat and potatoes of the climate change tactic lies in the fact that all of these permasteads will be producing compost. Instead of burning garden/yard waste like many people are used to, you instead cultivate compost. This is required to increase the fertility of the soil over time without using any kind of chemicals. The bonus of not burning it is that all the carbon in the decayed matter stays in the ground and out of the atmosphere. Simply adding a stipulation that the permasteads produce compost and  also must grow a little bit of fast growing bio mass intensive material with the specific intention of sinking carbon.

To take this even further, you can revitalize depleted land, and even desert land, with permaculture techniques. This would allow for massive areas in Nevada, New Mexico, and surrounding desert to be converted to lush green pastures and eventually forests. You have a few hundred or thousand families that know a thing or three about permaculture. Another stipulation of getting this land is that you must spend a few weeks each year working this desert land. After 3 years or so the land should be habitable and the cycle of housing more people, this time on once uninhabitable land, can continue. Fast growing pioneer plants will create the initial habitat, microclimate, and biomass to start the compost cycle. As mentioned before, this is a massive carbon sink. What was once arid desert can now become long term carbon storage and abundant in life.

By building Eathships, you also take a bite out of the tire pollution. Each room in an Earthship design can use a few hundred tires. These are available everywhere and those that have them would love to get rid of them.

**Untouched topics**

Schooling. Old community schoolhouses modeled with Montessori principals should produce quite a higher caliber child when compared to traditional school.

Medical. Refrain from taking those not fit at first. Life flight would be available for emergencies, but no real medical assistance beyond what the communities learn (CPR, etc should be taught). A problem for down the road, if ever, IMO.

Communications. Satellite probably. Skype, etc. One per community, not a big deal IMO. 

Culture shock. If you move several families at once, the shock can be mitigated by having a well known support group. Move in families that agree to live together. Families that were already friends, family, and neighbors would likely for the best permasteading communities.

How does this help the economy, where are the jobs? A simple explanation is that every dollar the government would spend on a project like this would return (and im spitballing here) a shit ton of dollars saved versus those older welfare style programs.

**Closing Plea**

The amount of money thrown away on wars on people, terror, drugs, campaign spending, and countless other total wastes of resources.. is staggering. With even a million (20 people making 50k a year) dollars you could get this ball rolling by building housing for 100 families. Train them in permaculture. After they get settled in for a year, you borrow 1 person from each household now and again as previously mentioned, think national guard, to work more arid/uninhabitable land. You'd have yourself an army that left in its wake not death and destruction, but vibrant, diverse ecosystems capable of supporting all life, especially humans, in great abundance. This newly habitable land would be stocked with the next generation of permasteaders and would feed the ranks of the army to either expand its land rehabilitation power, or allow the older ranks to retire from a job well done. Protect the work by giving nature rights at least equal to, and likely beyond, humans.

I think this  generation should be the generation to get every single person on the entire planet in an Earthship surrounded by a thriving permaculture. To at least try to create our own heaven on Earth. It is a simple goal from a technical standpoint. It is dirt cheap from an economic vantage.

My good friend and other people from our food co-op organized a garden this year. The plot is on city land, next to a water treatment facility. It was previously house lots before being bought for the water facility. Then the two lots were just a big lawn the city had to mow.

We approached the city council, and several were interested in the idea of a community garden. We managed to get 1 of 2 parcels the city owns. There are several other empty lots and parcels of city land we may be able to get in coming years - our city has a good yard waste compost program and could provide TONS of compost and even wood mulch for sites that don't have as rich soil. We're in the red river valley of ND, so our soil is very black and amazing, but has a lot of clay, so it doesn't drain well.

This year has been an amazing success. We had up to 30 different volunteers working each week at points (especially when we cut the sod and when we planted) In the bottom of the shot is a road that runs the length of the lot. Easily 10 people a day drive the road and admire the garden.

Most of the lot is used communally, meaning we plant big rows of veggies with a nifty seed planter,and many people help with the different stages of planting and get produce roughly proportional to their work. 

Since it was our food co-op that started it, we sell our heirloom tomatoes, of which we have many varieties and colors, at the co-op. There are no other suppliers of heirloom tomatoes in the area, so it doesn't compete with our other local growers.

The best news: the building in the shot will be a housing co-op hopefully by the end of the month! We secured funding from people in the community that wanted to do slow money investment. The current owner is getting older and wants to sell. We already have two founding members living in the house. It will house 6 - 9 people as we convert the 4 apartments into less kitchens (and one big kitchen) and more bedrooms.

There are many parallels: Both movements reject the current agricultural industry model of feeding people.

Paleo is based on the concept that humans developed without grains (corn, wheat, rice) and that there are many negative health effects related to grains.  Paleo rejects grains as food and promotes meat, vegetables, greens, fruit and nuts.  The list of acceptable foods in Paleo is similar to the list of perennial permaculture plans (plus annual kitchen garden vegetables).  

An interesting observation while studying Paleo is that the human society organization has been deeply affected by our system of agriculture, leading to a centralized top down control system that first is observed in ancient Egypt, and has continued through many generations of people.

The production of grain takes large areas of land which are rendered unusable for natural plants and animals.  Modern agricultural methods are deeply disturbing to natural systems in many ways.  Depletion of topsoil is just one negative impact on the natural environment and also leads to the conclusion that the grain fed society is not sustainable.

Permaculture suggests that we can learn from nature to create perennial food forests which are beneficial to people and nature.  Permaculture, if practised by a large number of people, would change the economic organization and power structure of human society.  

I am wondering if anyone has sources that try to tie in the foods recommended in the Paleo diet to a specific type of Permaculture design.  Interconnecting these two movements can have very important results by showing people how they can improve their own diet by creating a garden around themselves in their own environment.",,False,,t5_2qkib,False,,,True,t3_1ibxs8,http://www.reddit.com/r/Permaculture/comments/1ibxs8/permaculture_and_paleo_diet/,

How deep should the footers for each terrace wall be set?

what are standard formulas for height of wall vs. width of flat area?

how best to handle drainage with a 100 year wall-service-life perspective?

from a permaculture mindset, what are effective (for 100 years) and relatively inexpensive building materials for walls? (oak tree trunks and mud? creekstone and cement? neutronium?)

I am recently getting into meditation, exercise, and avoiding overuse of electronics.  As these ideas grew I began trying to find a way to not become dependent on society working a job I am not interested in provide things for myself I do not need.  While trying to find a solution online I came across permaculture which is why I'm here.

What does it take to begin a self-sustaining life?  My plan would be to buy a couple acres, build a cob house, and learn permaculture to sustain myself.  What does it take to reach this point?  I don't know what kind of information you guys are able to provide, but whatever information you have would be helpful.  What is the cost of getting started with a couple acres, materials for a small cob house, and any materials for permaculture?  What materials do you need for this?  Can permaculture be practiced anywhere?   How much land is required to sustain yourself?  Do you use electricity or plumbing?

&gt;Cement mortar mixerswill mix cob if you can handle the fumes and noise. As with 
manual mixing, the clayey soil and sand is mixed first, then the straw added. The cob 
has to be mixed wetter than with other types of mixing to allow the cement mixer to 
turn without too much stress. This means the mix may have to sit a day or two to dry 
to the right consistency. Straw can be added manually to the mix. 

Does anyone have any experience with this?  I'm heavily leaning towards building a cob cottage this summer and the idea of mixing a 1000 cubic feet of cob by hand by myself sounds intimidating.  Mixing a few cubic feet at a time in a mixer sounds much more reasonable to me.

In the future, I hope to have a multi-species, pasture-based operation like what I'll be seeing over the summer.

I need to know what to take away from this experience. I know dozens of questions I'd like to ask, but I don't know what it is I don't know (you know?).

To all of you farmers, professional and amateur, (but especially professional) what are some things a budding farmer needs to learn before I dive in and buy my own land and start operations? Where do I need to spend my time the most during this internship?

I am however getting things back in order and now I am  able to go back there every two weeks to work on it for a couple days at a time. This is turning out to be very slow as you can imagine, since only my brother is working on the site when I am not there and he takes care of a lot of thing, but altough he can build just fine, he is not an expert. But enough of that!  

I was thinking that there might be interest in coming down and have sort of an internship in natural building in exchange for your hard work. You would probably stay at my family home with my mom and my brother and you would be able to eat whatever is available to eat. Or if you preffer you could make a camp site by the project. I would come every other week and stay 4 or 5 days with you and during that time you will learn everything you need to learn about cob. I will also teach you some other techniques like how to make adobe, wattle and daub etc. Only thing you need to do is work hard (there will be plenty of fun times as well, don worry) And pay your travel expenses and your beer. Anyway, I just came up with the idea, if there is any interest I can work on the details a bit. It would have to be anytime from now till april since in summer it just rains a lot.

1319731190.0,23,self.Permaculture,lr2j3,Community garden or back to vacant lot..,26,3,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/Permaculture/comments/lr2j3/community_garden_or_back_to_vacant_lot/,"hi there everyone at reddit permaculture! This site has been an important space for my ongoing learning experience in food and gardening universes. The small group i'm a member of, brooklyn permaculture, has been working on various projects to improve food access for both rural and urban sites.


Our current project is to help a community that has been fighting with the city for a lot that has remained vacant since the 1960s. After a long struggle the city gave them the keys with a 4-6 month window to prove they've established a garden. If previous conduct is anything to guage future action, they will indeed relish in taking back the space. Two for one, they get to say they donate x acres of space for gardens while not relinquishing potentially lucrative development sites.. Thanks to the industrialist mayor, over 200 gardens have lost security and stand to be demolished with the appropriate bid amount.


So what we're going to do is give them the least ground possible to take it back. We plan to build a small greenhouse and attached chicken coop so something can be seen above the snow. We're working desperately to find materials and plans that meet the availability of what's around. The soil is typical brooklyn soil: clayey, contaminated, compacted and dead, and acidic. We do design integrated remediation systems but the community is pressed for time. We agreed that so long as we could create a 8''-12'' layer of topsoil that was teeming with soil microbial life and this was kept thoroughly mulched then the garden soil will be at least better off that any other community garden in brooklyn. I was a proponent for innoculating the sheet composting (read below) mat with grain spawn so we can encourage some white-rot enzymes to break down the PAHs below, but finances for such an adventure aren't available. I'm hoping the coprinus species we often get in bales of hay will do something for us below..



http://bkpermaculture.org/what-we-do/projects/halsey-garden/



The garden faces almost due south but because of tree cover we're limited in the amount of grow space we can put in (at least for the sun-loving favorites people plant). We will cut back what we can, and we will likely coppice the little maples on the property to get some immediate light in and provide us with additional mulch and logs for mushroom cultivation. We feel ambivalent about taking down trees in a city but between food access for hungry folk and a couple stunted and misshapen trees, we gotta take them down..  As far as the lot's history, all we know is that it used to have a residential building constructed in 1910 on the site until the 1960s, when it was demolished. The area has been fallow since and has built up a surprising amount of soil. Last digs I made I got down about 6''-9'' without equipment.


Id like to discuss the site in its entirety at some point but for the time being id like to focus on the structure and the vegetable beds to get some ideas bouncing around.  We have a green architect friend that might be able to source us double and triple glazed windows with frames from demolition sites. We'd prefer not to use plastic products that require landfilling eventually. We want our project here to be applicable and accessible for others nearby so we want a somewhat reproducible system.


The dimensions of the greenhouse is 10' by 20' with a coop off one side at 10' by 6'.  the link to this article shows a preliminary sketch of the space. What we want is a series of three foraging areas for the chickens. Two outdoor runs under mulberry trees, and the greenhouse in the winter. The grading of the space is nominal, since it was formerly leveled for a building. Has anyone designed something similar to this or have ideas we could chew over?


The other concern I wanted to share with the reddit community is our annuals mat. The community was clear that they wanted individual beds. Since we do so much work in community gardens, our group is too familiar with the same mistakes in every garden. I personally dislike the plot beds. Hyphal networks can't connect with so many compacted paths, generally the beds are vulnerable little patches more than exemplary self-maintaining life systems. We opted to make the annuals space one large topsoil mat with keyholes instead. Every member will need to participate in workshops in soil building and care and learn about the soil food web. The plan is to lay down a surface area (oblong to meet the sunny spaces available) of about 800 sq. ft. for keyhole beds. 


The middle of the space will house pollinating plants and pest predator habitats and nectaries. Certainly, folk will want some anisse hyssop leaves and yarrow for tea now and again but that area will by and large be left alone so our beneficials are comfortable have hunting grounds in any direction they go. Native wildflowers have been suggested too but i'm curious to know if there are some that will overtake the space.. anything jump out at yall?


We'd like to build as much soil as possible to create something of a barrier with existing soil.


The sheet composting plan is as follows (top to bottom):
seedless mulch  -- 
compost and biochar (2''-3'')  --  
cardboard and newspaper weed barrier  --  
horse manure, coffee grounds, spent fungal substrate, vegetable cuttings  --  from community  --  
bales of seedy hay  --  then  
mineral mixture of rock phosphate, lime, and greensand


i've been growing in bales now for a while and the duff created within weeks seems to be great material for quick soil building. I throw some innoculated biochar in there and I want to eat the stuff!


Everything we're doing is pro bono, it'd be great to have the funding to put everything together, but then again, if we had a sizable budget, we'd be doing it for new yorkers we don't want to help and therin lies the rub.. so please keep in mind that we're trying to build something fantastic with little more than a thousand bucks, a lot of dumpstering and pestering, and the committed hearts of a dozen good people.


I eagerly look forward to hearing your responses, critiques, support, or otherwise!

**BASIC**

* First, ensure you know exactly what you want to do with the land.  

* How are you getting water? (*MOST IMPORTANT QUESTION*)  What is the rainfall like?  Have wells been attempted around you?  What success?

* How are you paying for the land?

* Conduct (or pay for) soil tests to ensure drainage, fertility, composition, and non-toxicity.  

* Know what you want to grow and ensure the land will allow it.

* Do you have the access to utilities that you desire?  If not, how much will it cost?

* Is the land near amenities you want?

* Structures on the land should be in good quality unless you don’t mind fixing/replacing them…best to have them appraised.

* is the land suitable for structures, or is it marshy?

* How will you access your land (esp in winter)?

* Is there significant slope that risks avalanche, slides, nutrient/soil erosion?

* Is there pasture/wood lot that you might want?  If wood, what kind?  

* Any infestations/diseases of flora?

* What can the local vegetation tell you about the land?

**LEGAL**

Have a lawyer ensure the contract is clear about

* encumbrances

* easements

* eminent domain

* liens

* water rights (very important)

* mineral rights.

* zoning laws allow for your plans for the land

* legally binding surveyed map of the land


**CLIMATE**

* Check the orientation of the land.  In the Northern Hemisphere, south facing land provides the best solar energy.


* What is the plant hardiness zone of the land you’re looking at?

* What is the weather like in spring, summer, autumn, winter?  (Precipitation, sun, wind)

* Is the area prone to natural disasters?  How will you mitigate these risks?


* What are the climate change predictions for the area (changes in temp, precipitation, sea level, population, vegetation)?


**SOCIAL**

* Is the land near amenities you want? (Emergency services, etc)

* What is the crime rate in the area?

* Are there industrial activities around you that could put you at risk?

* What are the political/cultural currents in the area?  Can you live with your neighbours?


**FINALLY** 


* This is a fun idea, but are you sure you want to?  Do you know what you’re getting into?

I'm pondering some of the more big-picture possibilities for dealing with quite a few ants in my garden. My soil is rather sandy, it rains here all the damned time (south west BC canada). I don't want to annihilate them, I just want to keep them in check a bit more. Controlling them with safer soap isn't doing much. It's too wet here for diatamacious earth, and obviously I don't want to use traps or other poisons. 

So far they are all over my broad beans and chard, as well as a few other things here and there. They don't actually seem to be destroying anything. the beans appear to be stunted a bit by their activity, but the chard seems mostly okay. I'm glad the ants are aerating the soil, etc. I just don't want them thriving off my garden quite so much.

I'm curious if anyone has any experience controlling them with other critters? Ducks? Chickens don't seem to pay them any mind. Any other critters? Some frogs I could release perhaps?

Anyway, any ideas ya'll have would be great.

**Edit*** It's been three weeks. I think the **cornmeal** worked to some degree. I notice a decrease in activity and presence, although they are certainly still around. They didn't appear to do any real damage to the Fava beans. Bonus: One of the more prominent hills hatched the other day and hundreds of ants flew of into the air within about 30 minutes.

There is a property I work on that will soon become a natural area dedicated to what I guess could be considered a ""park/permaculture primer"" of sorts for my community. On the property is a man made pond-a berm was built on the side of a creek to create a ~~~10000 sqft.~~ *15000 sqft.* pond, at some points maybe 3 feet deep but I'd guess 1-2feet is more likely the average 

This property is in Oklahoma, meaning it is very hot and dry for most of the year. Nearly 1/3 of the pond gets dried up over the year, the water is bathwater warm, and algae is everywhere. The only things I see living in and around the pond are frogs, minnows, and a beautiful flock of mallard ducks (which is more than I expected, honestly). I doubt larger fish could ever survive here because of the water temperature. Three sides of the pond border a fairly decent sized forested area, while the fourth is a grassy field adjacent to the barn and house of the family that recently lived here. The immediate border of the pond is mostly multifloral rose, mud, or honeysuckle. Blackberry brambles are another common plant around the pond.

Given these conditions, do you think it is plausible to be able to take this unappealing pond and restore it to a more diverse and useful habitat? Swimming and fishing seems implausible, but various wetland plants are rather important to my community. If this is plausible, do you have any tips or good reading material for me to learn about restoration strategies?

Thank you!

[Here](http://i.imgur.com/KVhaCY5.jpg) is our land, showing how water runs down one small steep slope, the slightly squishy section of the land, and the part that's really bad. We're planning to do the garden on this side of the yard to avoid the problems that come from animals and excess water and the cost (environmental and $) to fix it. I'd like to avoid bringing in a ton of soil, and putting in a drainage pipe is a lot of trouble, as we'd have to dig all the way around to the back of the house to avoid draining on someone's property. I am debating between:

creating steps in the land (3 different levels) but am unsure if the bottom level would still just fill up?

hugekultur beds and/ or swales- would I build these going down the hill the way the water runs or north to south? My main concern here is that we get significant rainfall sometimes Oct-May, I don't have much relish for the idea of trudging in semi flooded trenches for that long.

Digging a couple of holes and burying some barrels with netted openings to capture the water like rainwater?

Or just digging a winter trout - summer tilapia pond? Pipe dreams, but you never know, maybe someone's done it!

Sorry for the novel, thanks for reading!

While it is true some invasive species have a negligible impact on the environment, and aren't too harmful(some forms of vetch), many are extremely harmful and should not be introduced.

I saw some recurring arguments for why they are not a concern that I would like to address. It has been argued for instance that if an invasive plant can thrive in a place, that the place had a vacuum of resources that it wasn't utilizing efficiently. This ignores how native species are in constant competition with one another and keep each other in check. When a new plant arrives somewhere that it is well adapted to, it has a huge advantage because the insects, fungal rusts, and other predators that eat it have not arrived.

Some have also argued that invasives don't do harm, but many do. In my area oak regeneration is at an all time low, because it is being crowded out and outcompeted by invasive species. Seedlings are just not popping up, and if we do not clear area for them to then when the current generation of oaks dies there will simply be no more oaks in our oak forest. These trees have a long life cycle an it takes forever for them to adapt to anything. Invasive plants also often bring with them invasive disease and insects, such as the fungal disease that decimated the American Chesnut populations, and in my home tome where we now have asian aphids invading because of all the invasive Chinese hackberry providing them habitat to establish.

I could discuss all the benefits of biodiversity, how various invasives harm the wildlife, and in some cases people, but that would be way tl;dr. I just want to end by stating that nature will not ""just correct itself"" or if it does then it could take millions of years. When man intervenes in an area it is outside the realm of what nature can control. Nature could not anticipate a plant evolving over millions of years to survive in isolated serpentine outcroppings in Portugal to be transported to serpentine outcroppings in California, and it has no way of handling it in the short term.",,False,,t5_2qkib,False,,,True,t3_wghkq,http://www.reddit.com/r/Permaculture/comments/wghkq/invasive_species_are_a_serious_concern/,

I've farmed hay on reclaimed strip mine ground for about seven years now, and just this past few months I've gotten around to stocking it.

There are seventy acres total, they're located in the southern midwest.

I'm going to do intensive dairy and beef as well as extensive pork and chicken. This means that the cows are the main attraction while the pork and chicken play secondary roles.

Milking shorthorns will be intensively grazed on the hay fields from April to December. When the forage grows faster than the cows can eat it; I'll turn it into hay. I'll have the cows giving birth in April, so that there is ample food when their energy demands are highest.

I'm working on a mixture of alfalfa, orchard grass, and timothy that will be palatable, fibrous, and energy dense to promote good yields. This will be planted on one seventh of the fields each year, with the pigs rooting another seventh to be reseeded each year. The lifespan of a forage stand is about seven years as best I can tell.

The milking shorthorn cattle will be bred to wagyu bulls to induce lactation. The resultant calves will get ample milk and quality forage to help with their grading factors.

The chickens will be run after the cattle for fly and odor control. I don't even care if they grow as long as they do their jobs.

&gt;We characterize this zone as the natural, unmanaged environment used for occasional foraging, recreation, or just let be. This is where we learn the rules that we try to apply elsewhere. (Permaculture: A Designer's Manual, Section 3.9: Zones)

In the permaculture design course I took, there was a heavy emphasis on the ""let it be"" aspect over the foraging or recreation aspects.  This space was described to me as unmanaged and for observation only.  The justification being that the natural world will always have things to teach.

I have 4 acres that is a bit wider than 150', and over 1000' long.  The house is at one end, making my zone 5 something of a trek from my front door.

I'm currently designing out past my zone 2, which for me is pasture for livestock.  Past that zone, the majority of work I've done is observation, some tree planting, and small amounts of passive soil building.  I'm looking now for a more integrative idea for my next 3 zones.

This property is farmland that has laid fallow for 20-30 years.  In that time a gallery forest has sprung up.  (I'm in a riparian area in drylands: The Middle Rio Grande Valley in New Mexico.)

I'd like to continue and accelerate the process of this land recovering from being a farm.  To 'restore' it to whatever it is this place is becoming.  (Like most of the world, the romantic ideal of restoration is at odds with newly introduced invasive species in this area, not to mention climate change.  I can't know exactly what I'm restoring this place to, but that is the best word I have.)  At the same time, I must obtain a yield from this part of the property to satisfy my partners.

So far, this is a fairly typical permaculture tension: make this a place that can support human beings while creating, rather than destroying, the ecosystem.

My native lens for understanding permaculture would be to describe it as ""systems ecology for the commons.""  As systems ecology is a specialization of general systems theory, I immediately run into a contradiction when thinking about zone 5:

In systems theory, 'observation' is the same as 'interaction.'  There is no separation of observer and observed.  This is in conflict with the notion of 'letting in be.'  Which would mean, from an understanding of systems theory, never even looking at it.  I'm just not quite sure what it is for a piece of land to be unmanaged.  I have, because of my above tautology, never seen one.

As a concrete example: What if my zone five consists entirely of invasive weeds?  What if that invasive is a monoculture or is otherwise reducing diversity?  It seems silly to increase diversity/restore soil everywhere but zone five.  But is it?

What if the zone five has soil that is utterly different than any other place on the property?  One way of arranging my zone five makes this true, but then what will it teach me?  That's a whole different microclimate and i struggle with what to compare it to.

What if my goal is hard-line restoration?  Should I remove the non-native species?  What does one do with zone 5 if you're not restoring it?  it seems leaving an ecosystem we already have enough of (disturbed, compacted soil) is not quite going the right way.

What is zone five through the lens of restoration?

Will you share some insights?  Some wisdom?  Some understanding?  Some practice?  I don't think this pondering has a firm, clear answer.  So I'm hoping more for the right question, rather than the right answer.  But if what you've got is to tell it like it is, please don't hold back!",,False,,t5_2qkib,False,,,True,t3_uhy6a,http://www.reddit.com/r/Permaculture/comments/uhy6a/lets_talk_zone_5/,

I'm asking this question because I'm finding that I'm somewhat stuck in my current situation; I came to a ""farm"" I found on WWOOF that advertised itself as being based in permaculture principles, but have found, after 4 months here, that that simply is not the case. My host doesn't have much real world experience in it and the design (or lack thereof) of the various farm elements here makes that clear. I wish to learn and be immersed in permaculture and it's not possible here.

Instead of trying my luck again on WWOOF (where it often seems that ""permaculture"" means that the farm has some perennials), I want to be sure of my direction and what I'm to be learning before I up and move to a new place. I know there are many programs out there for which you pay to attend a short term course, which is a step in the right direction, but what would really be ideal is a place that I can stay and trade my labor in exchange for learning (like WWOOF).

Does anybody know of any long term programs or particular work trade arrangements in the US or Canada where one can approach permaculture authentically and in earnest?

Thanks for reading this far. I hope some of you can share your own advice/stories for picking up permaculture.",,False,,t5_2qkib,False,,,True,t3_m0fox,http://www.reddit.com/r/Permaculture/comments/m0fox/where_to_live_and_learn_permaculture/,

Does anyone know anything about trying to convert an existing ordinary wood into a food forest?  If it's doable, I want to try this.

Here's my info:
I have around 5 acres of land in the puget sound region.  The back acre or so of our parcel is wooded with youngish alder stands, with little else in the way of large trees.  The floor of the wood is currently covered in a variety of berries-- mostly wild blackberries, but there are also thimbleberries, and probably salmonberries.  The land is in flood plain, so the soil is fairly clay once you get down below the duff and top layers of soil.

I really want to get some nut trees growing back there, but it's too far from water sources to water seedlings, and I'm concerned about the clay soil.  I could fertilize and weed, and chickenwire young trees to protect them from predation while they get established, but that would be about the extent of the intervention/care I could pull off.  With that in mind, I wonder whether the existing wood could function as nurse plants for young trees, protecting them from sun, wind, and heavy rain.
