**What you'll need**

* A computer 

* An Origin account

**Step 1**

*(Before doing anything keep in mind that any doughnuts you have right now may be used, but don't worry. You can get them back with Homer buddhas later on.)  

* Download [bluestacks here](http://www.bluestacks.com/)

* Download the simpsons tapped out apk from [spAnser here](http://www.reddit.com/r/tappedout/comments/1cgao0/how_to_get_all_the_premuim_items_you_want_taking/c9gf2q4) 

* Install bluestacks using the default settings

* Once bluestacks is done installing, install the Simpsons tapped out apk ( simply drag and drop the spk onto the bluestacks window)

*Note:  Bluestack may ask you to ""auto sync"" or ""1click sync"". You will not need to do so for our goal.* 

**Step 2**

* Launch Simpsons Tapped out from the My apps page ([image](http://i.imgur.com/9Cz6QVb.png))
 * Simpsons will update to the latest version

* Simply login to your origin account and enter your springfield.

**Step 3**

* This part is fairly straightforward. Spend Spend Spend.

* Tap anything you want to buy, or rush, with doughnuts and you'll get it.

* Once you're done shopping Buy yourself a few hundred thousand cash using doughnuts and exit the game using the ""back"" arrow in the bottom left of bluestacks UI

* If you want to bring a limited amount of doughnuts with you back to your device then, before logging out, buy Homer buddhas until you win a ""doughnut reward 

 I recommend spamming this until you get the 150 doughnuts reward). As soon as you win the amount of doughnuts you want to keep, **Logout**.


Congratulations!

I hope that this guide will help ease [u/-0__o-](http://www.reddit.com/user/-0__o-)'s workload. ( As well as the others who have offered their services to the community)

**FAQ**

1.

 Q. I installed BlueStacks and updated simpsons  but when tapping the main splash screen to enter my springfield the App's screen turns black and suddenly im back at BlueStack's homepage. Aka app crashing on startup.

A. A restart of your computer should fix the problem. Try not to have any other programs running when launching Simpsons ( Chrome, Itunes, etc)

2. Q.  

After I buy everything I want using unlimited doughnuts and i'm trying to win doughnuts from the homer buddha to bring back to my device, will the doughnuts i win stack? ( If I win "" 30 doughnuts "" from one Homer and 150 from the next Homer   will I have 180 doughnuts when I logout/login?)

A. From what I've seen. No. You will still ""spend"" 15 doughnuts on a Homer buddah with each purchase. 

So if you win 30 doughnuts from HomerB, then buy another HomerB and win another 30. If you logged out now you would have 45 doughnuts.",,False,self,t5_2v7cj,1367287388.0,,gil,True,t3_1cgao0,http://www.reddit.com/r/tappedout/comments/1cgao0/how_to_get_all_the_premuim_items_you_want_taking/,

Once it gets into the negative you can spend donuts freely, buying everything up without a cost as the donuts continue to go into the negative (I hit -900 while testing).

The donut count resets back to 1, or perhaps whatever it was before it was negative (unable to test right now), when you exit the game and re-launch. However all of the things you bought with donuts still remain. I tested this with:

* Buying Otto's bus
* Buying the Duff Brewery
* Buying 100k dollars

My question is: **what do I do with this information?**

I saw other posts about glitches where you can obtain fixed numbers of donuts (eg. 100), but they seemed to be more about people asking if glitches still worked (which it appears not). I tried to have a look for official EA details about reporting bugs, or even if there are rules of conduct that state my Origin account will be banned since I have used this.

Many users here have complained about the frequent hacking posts, so I tried to keep it all in one thread. 

Others have mentioned that it would be hard to keep track of everything in one thread, due to comments getting lost, buried, etc.

So this way, we can keep all the requests out of here, keep a nice organized format devoted to only giving/receiving help with the game over there, and it keeps the clutter here to a minimum.

Let me know what you guys think, feedback is always appreciated!

1375804820.0,71,self.tappedout,1jtgag,Fan site tstotips.com has been hacked,80,9,236,http://www.reddit.com/r/tappedout/comments/1jtgag/fan_site_tstotipscom_has_been_hacked/,"Popular fan site http://tstotips.com appears to have been hacked by a scammer. The most [recent post](http://tstotips.com/2013/08/06/gamezino/) on the site was made by the site owner, who is known to be on an extended vacation without regular Internet access. All other editors to the site appear to have had their privileges revoked.

The purpose of the hack appears to be to promote a scam site which claims to offer discount items for your game.

The following conversation occurred on IRC shortly after the hack:

&gt; 11:37 &lt; WynterCove&gt; Regarding the most recent post on the site, how do we know that Gamezino is legit? Mr. T said they are, but didn't say how he knew they do what they say they do. They could be claiming to    
&gt;                     use bulk iTunes gift cards, but could just as easily be using a hacked version of the game.   
&gt; 11:38 &lt; dLux&gt; they ""spend the credit inside the game for you""   
&gt; 11:38 &lt; dLux&gt; so i hafta give them my origin acct info?   
&gt; 11:38 &lt; dLux&gt; hail no!   
&gt; 11:38 &lt; WynterCove&gt; Exactly. That's what they claim. But how can we be sure their claims are true?   
&gt; 11:39 &lt; WynterCove&gt; I tried commenting on the post, but Mr. T deleted my comment without approving it.   
&gt; 11:39 &lt; dLux&gt; even if they are, it's a shady business model that i do not think will endure   
&gt; 11:40 &lt;@mrfy&gt; i don't think that is really Mr T   
&gt; 11:40 &lt;@mrfy&gt; and i think the account was hacked   
&gt; 11:40 &lt; BeefyTrout&gt; uh oh   
&gt; 11:40 &lt; WynterCove&gt; Really?   
&gt; 11:40 &lt;@Rcsprinter&gt; Yup   
&gt; 11:40 &lt;@mrfy&gt; my editing and posting abilities have been turned off   
&gt; 11:40 &lt; dLux&gt; o hail no that's not official, and yes they must be using a hacked version, because they're selling xmas items that are no longer available   
&gt; 11:41 &lt; WynterCove&gt; mrfy: That would explain why my comments are being deleted.   
&gt; 11:41 &lt; dLux&gt; indeed   
&gt; 11:41 &lt; dLux&gt; welp there goes the neighborhood   
&gt; 11:41 &lt;@mrfy&gt; yes. i've been talking to rcsprinter, and mickus about it   
&gt; 11:41 &lt; dLux&gt; i would redirect the dns until the post is removed   
&gt; 11:42 &lt; dLux&gt; redirect to a static page saying it was hacked   
&gt; 11:42 &lt;@mrfy&gt; all negative comments are being deleted by someone   
&gt; 11:42 &lt; WynterCove&gt; mrfy: Have their permissions to post been revoked as well?   
&gt; 11:42 &lt; dLux&gt; it is not ok that this is at the top of tstotips   
&gt; 11:42 &lt;@mrfy&gt; Wynter, yes   

Edit: In the spirit of full disclosure, I should mention that I am WynterCove from the IRC conversation.

Edit: More info [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/tappedout/comments/1jtgag/fan_site_tstotipscom_has_been_hacked/cbisq45)

Update (2013-08-11): Gamezino has added two new posts to tstotips.com. According to the original authors of the posts, these were originally written before the site takeover. They were then edited in order to appear to promote Gamezino, and then posted as the original authors, completely without their permission. The authors (mrfy and Rcsprinter) do not endorse Gamezino, and never approved the edits Gamezino made to their posts.

Update (2013-08-11): Recently surfaced photos prove Gamezino is using a hacked version of the game. Photos give step-by-step instructions to Gamezino employees on how to use a hacked version of the game to fill customer orders: http://s1279.photobucket.com/user/Gamezino/library/STEPS

Season 24 Yard Sale

*Homer:* Is it the season finale of our show already?  I can't believe another year's gone by, and we're all not a year older…

*Homer:* Except for Apu and Manjula's octuplets, who age for some reason. Didn't they used to be younger than Maggie?

*Homer:* ...and all we have to show for it is a mountain of crap in the attic!

*Lisa:* So this is our update for the season finale -- a fourth-wall joke?!  Aren't there any characters or quests?

*Homer:* Well, I guess you could make Lovejoy ride his train for the finale -- that kind of fits.

*Lisa:* Why don't we have a yard sale, dad?

*Homer:* And for the episode before it, you could have Carl honor his Icelandic heritage... if you had Carl.

*Lisa:* I know!  What if we sold a bunch of cool premium items from this season's episodes?

*Homer:* Pfft.  What kind of idiot would want to buy that junk?

*System Message:* Celebrate the end of Season 24 by buying stupid junk! Available for a limited time only!

I just had an idea tonight to throw together a place that one could view a whole different bunch of buildings layouts to get inspiration from. It was made pretty quickly so it isn't perfect. I went through a load of posts on imgur from r/tappedout and picked a bunch that look really awesome. As of now I'm kinda running out of space in the nav so I picked what seemed to be the most submitted buildings.

Only after making the bulk of this did I think to see if it existed somewhere else. I checked tstotips and there seems to be a broken gallery page, but the buildings some people have submitted are really awesome.

Oh also you can submit your layout too! Otherwise I'll probably troll imgur, this sub and tstotips for images. I'd welcome any suggestions anyone has!

1370413783.0,37,self.tappedout,1fpglv,A warning to all Tapped Out players,53,16,38,http://www.reddit.com/r/tappedout/comments/1fpglv/a_warning_to_all_tapped_out_players/,"First, a little background- I've been playing Tapped Out since sometime in March. A huge fan of the show since day one, I've pumped many hours into the game so far (especially around Whacking Day... didn't reach top tier, but whacked over 9000 snakes) I've reached level 30 just recently and am eagerly awaiting the Squidport and Krustyland expansions. 

Until Sunday. Had to go to a graduation and set the entire town on 4 hour tasks. When I got back, the game would start to load then drop to the Bart screen. It would always say the same thing, ""Couldn't Connect to Server"" and try again and again to do it... but fail to do so. And when you see my town from a friend's device, the town itself is the same but my name has changed to something entirely different. 

I tried all the ""fixes"" on EA's website, deleting the game and reinstalling, nothing works. I can play anonymously on my tablet and when I try to log into my account from a friend's device it gives the same message. In other words, this is absolutely 100% on EA's side. I've had an open ticket since Sunday but nobody from their tech support has returned any further emails or requests to contact me and let me know wtf is going on. 

The kicker to the story is this.. I tracked down their phone number for customer support (and not on their website, I might add) After holding for 45 minutes, a tech finally came on the line. After hearing what I had to say and reviewing the ticket I had open, he said some rather enlightening things that I think you all should be aware of. He told me that as it was a ""free"" game, the phone techs couldn't do anything about it only the e-mail techs. I pointed out to him that while that was technically true, EA goes above and beyond to get us to spend money (donuts) left and right in the game.. what if I HAD purchased those donuts from Gil like I had meant to? He then told me that they only had limited resources to bring to bear on the issue.... and I pointed out to him that EA is the largest videogame company in the damn world. If they don't have the resources to attend to paying customers who are locked out, that's pretty piss poor. Finally he told me that it was the developer's issue and that he couldn't do anything about it. 

A quick review of the Tapped Out forums over at EA reveal this to be an issue not unique to me. Other users report the same issues, from the ""Bart Screen of Death"" down to the names of their towns being switched out on them. Some have been locked out for weeks and in some cases over a month and many of them claim to have spent money on donuts. (Again, I have not.. so I don't have as much of a dog in this fight other than my time invested) EA has made it extremely clear that they cannot or will not fix my issue, though I hold out for hope that the Screw Up Fairies will magically visit in the night and un-fuck whatever it is they fucked up. But I wanted to make sure that the rest of the Tapped Out community sees this. I don't expect you to stop playing, hell, if it popped back on for me tonight you can bet I'd be tapping away with the lot of you... but before you spend another dime on donuts, please remember my tale before you fork over real money for a product that EA is willing to take your money for over but not think highly enough to warrant real tech support for. 

TL;DR- Locked out of my account for days, EA seems unwilling/unable to do anything about it. Think twice before buying donuts. ",,False,self,t5_2v7cj,False,,,True,t3_1fpglv,http://www.reddit.com/r/tappedout/comments/1fpglv/a_warning_to_all_tapped_out_players/,
1369450224.0,40,self.tappedout,1f0e74,How much have YOU given?,47,7,51,http://www.reddit.com/r/tappedout/comments/1f0e74/how_much_have_you_given/,"I was curious about how much money EA is making from this game, and specifically from each person. So I decided to do a little research. It's true - this may not reflect every single player profile out there. But consider the following:

EA has made quite a bit of money from TS:TO.
In the month of March 2013 alone it made 10 million in digital revenue.
And since it's launch in August 2012, it's made over 50 million.
They purport to have 5.4 million daily active users across both the iOS and Android platform.

Impressive numbers. What's even more impressive is their overpricing.

The normal price for a new video game is usually $59.99.
[(Consider a few PC examples here. Most console games are around the same price)](http://www.pcmag.com/slideshow/story/290410/the-top-10-best-pc-games/1)

Now $60 dollars gets you the full game. Let me repeat that: it gets you the FULL GAME. Yes, you have expansions that come out afterwards, but for the most part, they are games in their own right. 

Is TS:TO anywhere near the same graphics, gameplay, and experience as say... Bioshock or Battlefield 3? Of course not! It doesn't even have true multi-player functionality. You can't interact with other players in real-time.
But ok, let's assume for a moment that TS:TO is a top-tier game. Let's assume it sells for the same price as those other games: $59.99. 

How many donuts would they have to sell to one person to earn $59.99?

Now, TS:TO is free to download and play. But by the grace of the EA gods, there are premium items available to players. They are not mandatory, but they certainly make your town look nicer. There are premium buildings, premium characters, and premium decorations. And they make it quite convenient to purchase donuts to buy these premium items. Here's how it breaks down:

Price | Amount of Donuts
:|::|
$1.99|	12
$4.99|	60
$9.99|	132
$19.99|	300
$49.99|	900
$99.99|	2400

Not surprisingly, it's cheaper per-donut to buy the largest pack of donuts. It comes out to $0.04 per donut. Compared to buying the 12 pack where the per donut cost comes out to $0.17 per. 

Why.. it's almost like they're *encouraging* you to buy the most expensive thing.

Now let's take a look at how the premium buildings break down in donut cost:


*BUILDINGS*

Item |                         Donuts
:|::|
Aztec Theater|	80
Duff Brewery|	190
Frink's Lab|	150
Lard Lad Donuts|	110
Springfield Observatory|	75
Springfield Sign|	170
Tire Fire|	40
Volcano Lair|	200
School Bus|	120
Krustylu Studios|	140
Asia de Cuba|	100
Lugash's Gym|	175
Open Air Stage|	160
Sprawl-Mart|	90
Mausoleum|	60
Santa's Village|	200
Mapple Store|	90
Barney's Bowlarama|	250
Try-N-Save|	70
Swanky Fish|	90
Duff Stadium|	90
Springfield Coliseum|	190
Sleep-Eazy Motel|	225
**Total**|	**3065**

Buying donuts at the cheapest per-donut rate, you would end up buying a 2400 pack, and a 900 pack, for a total of $150. This gives you 3300 donuts and lets you purchase every premium building that is currently available. 

What about the premium characters in the game?

    
*CHARACTERS*

Item |                         Donuts
:|::|
Hans Moleman|	60
Kearney|	60
Squeaky-voiced teen|	30
The Rich Texan|	85
Fruit-Bat-Man|	90
Blue Funzo|	50
Pink Funzo|	70
Purple Funzo|	60
Santa's Little Helper|	150
Frink's Robot Dog|	60
Leprechaun|	150
Lumpy|	55
**Total**|	**920**

You'd end up spending $49.99 for the 900 pack to buy all those.

This doesn't even include the premium decorations, which, when totaled up, come out to 1870 donuts. At the cheapest per-donut cost, you'd end up spending another $100 dollars on the 2400 pack.

The grand total for all the premium items currently available in the game comes out to approximately: $300.

That is FIVE times as much as a brand new, full-featured, complete PC/Console game. 

Now obviously, not every single person is going to buy every single premium item in the game. This simply serves to illustrate how aggressive and over-inflated their pricing is. It may not seem like a big deal to buy one building here and a character there... but in the long run, it adds up. In the long run, you will end up paying more than you think. There are a few reasons for this:

* Most people don't keep track of their in-game purchases. EA knows this - in fact, they count on this to keep selling their premium merchandise.
* The Simpsons is a strong brand. When a new premium item comes out, and it's donuts only, you can't justify NOT having it. How can you play the game without the characters that you've known for such a long time?
* Your friends have these items. So naturally, you will want to have them as well. It's a normal human tendency to want things other people have.
* A big chunk of those 5.4 million daily users are kids. And EA knows that they will get their parents to buy them premium items. And again, most parents don't keep track of in-game purchases. 

So when you see all these people using hacks and cheats, and you wonder why they've decided not to pay for these items like everyone else has...
perhaps understanding EA's overpricing will help you understand those individuals a little better. 

They are not out to make a great game that deserves our money.  
They are out to make a DLC-based game that they can milk for as much money as they can by leveraging the Simpsons brand.   
  
And you know what, they have.  

And they have $50+ million to prove it.",,False,self,t5_2v7cj,False,,skinner,True,t3_1f0e74,http://www.reddit.com/r/tappedout/comments/1f0e74/how_much_have_you_given/,

**TIPS:**

* House farming is a common strategy (tip). Building a large number of similar houses to gain money and experience. Two types of houses yield the best result: brown houses and blue houses. Brown houses will give you a little money and experience every 3 minutes. Blue will give you more every 8 hours. Recommended size starting at 100; however, the more the better. *-Hatefulmoe*

* Never trust Gil. *-Scarsdale_Vibe*

* Don't use precious donuts to purchase cash. (Unless, of course, said donuts are free). *-Scarsdale_Vibe*

* Remember later in the evening to assign 8-12h jobs. *-Scarsdale_Vibe*

* On the build menu there is an ""I"" (lower case-damn autocorrect) if you click that it opens an options menu. You can turn on confirm doughnut spending. I have lost more than a couple doughnuts tapping to fast and rushing jobs that finish so fast there was no time to cancel. *-Badwaytogo*

* I've pimped out my Springfield with over a thousand houses. Not quite where I want to be yet, but bringing in 200,000 - 300,000 a day. I refuse to spend cash on this game, so with that in mind, a donut is worth any amount of game cash.
I recently tried every item available in the game, to figure out which yielded the most XP per dollar spent. Final calculation considers the money refunded after selling the item. The objective is to spend your game cash on items, collect the XP, and then sell them to repeat the process. The XP adds up and provides donuts through bonus levels.
Here's what I found: If you have unlimited time and ambition, the best XP for your dollar is in the basic $25 Shrubs. While this will take hours of placing thousands of shrubs, selling, and repeating, you're paying $4 per 1 XP.
If you value your time in the slightest, I'd just go with the Volleyball Nets. $6.15 per 1 XP and in high quantities at a time (549 XP a pop). Conveniently, these are also at the top of the list for best rate.
As of the update, I'm sweating this 350,792 that popped up for the bonus level. I'm hoping it goes back down to 120,000. Provided we can keep the 120,000 rate, you're paying 738,000 - 838,000 for 3 donuts (depending on your luck) by buying and selling masses of volleyball nets.
*TLDR: Buying and selling Volleyball Nets is the equivalent to purchasing XP at a rate of 6.15 game dollars. All in all, you get a shot at 3 donuts for 738,000. * *-DrinkMyShorts*


**TRICKS:**

* Tap Homer ten times to receive ten donuts and the Jebediah Statue *-I_smell_awesome, Zinko999*

* When you visit a neighbor you have the opportunity to tap three items for money once every 24 hours. If you make the first tap and leave, the 24 clock starts. Once 24 goes by you are now able to tap the remaining times, leave and re-enter to tap 3 times again (of course the clock starts again). *-Hatefulmoe*

 * Another thing about tapping stuff at a neighbor's town, you don't have to tap to pick it up or wait to get the bonus exp. just tap three things and go to the next one and repeat. *-NextDayAir*

I was running the site with the help of some incredible friends from the Tapped Out world in the absence of the sites owner, Mr. T (Tony Campbell). It's time something is done here and I'll be the one to do it. Aside from what we think of the business or the name or the You Tube site we all need to stand together and NOT send any traffic to these places just for the complete unprofessionalism of the way things went down. Me, RCSPRINTER, Werdna, Mickus and mrfy busted our asses to provide a place for people to go to get any and all help for a game that none of us has any affiliation to and did it for free and NEVER forced anyone to accept a business or thought or see things our way or they were removed, blocked and edited. This is not cool in my opinion and we are not going to be forced to comply with someone views just to get info on a game the owner of the site didn't create. It sickens me to still receive notifications from people genuinely wanting help from Tips or even questioning the validity of a post and know I can't even go on and respond or help them. They're being duped and forced to conform which is downright wrong. A few of us are working on a new site where you can get the same experience as Tips without being forced to ""be nice"" to a certain business, thought or cause. I don't care what anyone says, you just don't act in that manner and expect ANYONE to keep coming to your site and now they're avoiding moderating any comment at all. What do you think is going to happen when A) They don't get answered soon and B) Get answered and find out what's going on? Their little rush of traffic will fade and the site will die all to further one persons cause. It's wrong folks, it's just wrong. I also have proof in the form of emails through Gmail with the new owners intent and Tony's confirmation that there is in fact a new owner. 
Here's the initial email from the new owner. He sent this AFTER he blocked all of us and posted his GameZino post:  https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/7801729/NewOwnerAnnouncement.png

Here's his response after I questioned the validity of his claim of ownership:

There is also no doubt that EA is watching this subreddit, as many of the things we have suggested have become part of the game. (Funny how Ned Flanders doesn't eat at the Truffle except for that one task with Edna. Even more strange is how Krusty never does anything at Krustilu Studios or Channel 6. Ditto for the kids who sometimes go watch Krusty's show in person in the series.)

But the ""crack eggs for donuts"" promise, it should work in the same way Mario gets a 1up after collecting 100 coins. In our case, it should work like this: every 100th egg cracked should contain a donut. Alternatively, every 100th snake whacked should be rewarded with one donut. Having both options would be great.

Feel free to add yours and correct my mistakes. 

1.	Really enjoyed the length of the event and the number of unlockable items. Liked that there was a combination of new buildings, characters, character unlocks that were all mostly unique and not holiday centric (like Halloween, Xmas, Thanksgiving, etc) 
2.	The Pet Snake was worthless. Just why? What did this add to the game on any level?
3.	Liked seeing the Duff Stadium and Sleep Eazy be the final prizes. All location and character combos are my favorite items/unlocks. 
4.	There is no two ways to put it. The whacking mechanism was a grind. And anytime a game feels like the game is a grind, that’s a loss. I think any of these options would have improved this:  
A.	**Reduce the snake targets by 20-50%.** This means instead of 12500 for the motel, anywhere between 6250 or 10000 would have been less frustrating.  
B.	**Whacking the snake should count for 1 snake. Then the drops should be an additional bonus**. Every time you whack a snake, you would get 1 snake PLUS 1, 2, or even 100 more snakes or anywhere between 4-10 eggs.  
C.	**Make the egg drops for friends a basket/box. I.e. anything but more individual eggs**. It took time to gift eggs. Like 4-10 seconds an egg. If we could drop off eggs in increments of dozen, it would save HOURS of time. And the items that came out of the boxes should be either snake or egg ICONS, not more actual snakes you have to whack. 
5.	I spent more time playing Tapped Out in the last month than ever before. And I have enjoyed this last month far less than any month prior. The game felt like it was needlessly wasting my time. I don't hack or cheat, but if the next event requires 2 hours a day of play to get the best items, I might either quit the game or skip it entirely. The items were great, but I am going to look back at this experience and wince. 
6.	Why was it even an option to spend donuts on eggs to give to friends? Did anyone need this? 
7.	Does lumpy have a multiplier bonus? For 55 dounts, it better not simply be a vanity item with no perks. Otherwise it’s WORSE THAN FUNZO. 
8.	Why was the Fat Tony/Rich Texan expansion released now? Couldn’t this have  waited until after Whacking Day? 
9. Why was Ninja Homer 120 donuts but Bumblebee man, squeaky voice and Moleman all only 60. And why was the Texan 85? These premium characters should all be priced consistently.  Even if he came with a multiplier, kind of overpriced. 
10. I'd give the ""prizes"" an A- with Tatum and the stadiums being my faves. This excludes the Pet snake, which was a D-. I'd give the ""Whacking Game"" a C-. Good idea, bad execution. 

Overall, I'd grade this as a C+ expansion. 

Xmas was a A- (big pluses from the Snow and the Santa Coin exchange at the end)

Thanksgiving was a D- (Balloons? that's it?)

Halloween was a B (lost points because of the disappearing Candy mishap)

Valentine's Day was a C+ (good decorations, not much else)

What are everyone else's grades on this and other expansions?

There seems to be a new topic every 6 to 12 hours asking for new files, or more information about how to do it.

There also seems to be a few people that look down upon such actions and they downvote not only the topic, but also any comments associated with it.  I get that people don't like other hacking, but there's no need to go into a thread and downvote people's comments because you don't like what they are doing.

If you are one of the people so opposed to it, why don't you make a thread asking the mods for a rule change to not allow topics about hacking/cheating?  It's right there in rule number 1, help the community evolve.

Personally, I think this sub should be for posts about new content as it becomes available, pictures of people's towns and unique layouts they have come up with, and people asking questions about bugs or other game-play tips.  I like seeing what other people are doing in the game, and letting people know they don't have to freak out that their town is gone because Origin is down.  I don't like seeing people go on a downvote rampage because they disagree with how someone else decides to play.

*System Message:* Celebrate the end of Season 24 by buying stupid junk! Available for a limited time only!

From what I have heard other places on the internet the yard sale will probably have a bunch of the limited time show promotions on sale for donuts.

Sorry guys, I got a notice there's an update, and the hack's not working for me anymore.  Sorry for those people I didn't get to.**

Hey guys,
So I'm also willing to help a few people out.  I'll try and do the first 10 people who message me in the next couple hours.  To help simplify things, I'll automatically give you all the premium buildings, characters, and whacking day items.  I'll also give everyone a couple hundred eggs so you can share the love with your friends.  
Just DM me your info (email and password- do a temporary one if you like) and let me know if you want anything else besides what I listed above, and how much money you want.  If you want me to get you all the whacking day prizes, let me know that too.

EDIT: Yes, I'm still doing this :) So this is my list so far, I'll cross you off as I finish.  If I missed something you wanted, let me know. In order to do this for you I'll need your origin login info- this is your email and password.
Also- some of the items might  be in your inventory so check there.  If you want all the premium items, I'm probably going to have to buy some land in order to have room for it all.

If your names not on the list- I'll still be happy to help, but it's going to have to be tomorrow.

I really enjoy this sub and I love playing Tapped Out. I could be in the minority but I'm getting pretty sick of seeing these ""Homer sure likes Zesty's!"" kind of posts where its nothing but a picture of characters doing something we have all seen 1 billion times in our own game. Sure, sometimes the game glitches out and creates something chuckle-worthy, but to me it really just dilutes the content here to see the same circle-jerk posts over and over. 

You won the Springfield Downs jackpot? You got Hans Moleman from a Homer Buddha? Two characters are standing next to each other and it kind of looks like they are interacting in a far-fetched way? Awesome. Just remember that same thing has happened to literally thousands of us already. 

I guess I'll I'm saying is maybe we should think about what the community is getting out of a post. I love screenshots of peoples towns because it helps others with design ideas. I like hearing about ways to maximize my earning power through various building/character combos. I love reading discussions about the pro's and con's of donut-hacking. There are so many ways to provide good content to this sub, perhaps we can all step back before we just post haphazardly.

With Whacking day, non-premium event-specific buildings (e.g., Fort Sensible) generate money and no snakes.

With Halloween, Christmas, and Valentines Day, visiting your friends was a great benefit, and helped you achieve your quest goals more quickly. With Whacking Day, it takes more time to visit friends, as you have to hunt for snakes, and due to losing snakes from your inventory and the difficulty of finding snakes in larger/busier towns, I frequently visit friends and end up with fewer snakes than I started with (my net after visiting friends this afternoon was -50). I've even lost snakes while placing eggs, which really sucks (I also had the game get to -1 egg then freeze and crash. When it restarted, I'd lost over 50 eggs).

12,500 is a *lot* of snakes. I know some people are using donuts to accelerate the process, but without them, it seems next to impossible to even come close in the next month. Only a handful of my friends list have even built Fort Sensible; unless something changes, I'm wondering how many are going to get the Sleep Eazy Motel, and how many are just going to get frustrated. Assuming even distribution of snakes/day (i.e., I don't acquire items that allow me to whack more snakes/day), I know I'm about 500 snakes behind where I need to be to get to 12,500 before the end of this event.

Edit: forgot to mention that Whacking Day feels a lot more like grinding, too. With how frequently snakes are generated, the maximum number available at any one time, and the number you need to get the Sleep Eazy, it seems you almost need to play the game every two hours. Previous events were more oriented around a 24-hour cycle.",,False,self,t5_2v7cj,1365912954.0,,,True,t3_1cb5ca,http://www.reddit.com/r/tappedout/comments/1cb5ca/disappointed_with_whacking_day/,

All of this can be done from your device, no computer needed. 

* **Video 1** : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEn_LApEVGQ

Add the Cydia Repo and install the apps

* **Video 2** : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVzLh7v5UCw

Download the hacked game with the provided link, remove the original, and put it in it's place. Use the mobileterminal and ldone to replicate the necessary permissions and binary signage.

* **Video** : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vnftrhz1S1Q

Activate the hack by buying/placing a tree or shrub and watch the donuts appear! They will only last for that session, and then it will go back to your normal donut count. Travelling to Krustyland and back will end your current session. Any donuts you had previously will be spent as normal.

*Example: You have 15, you spend 60 with the hacked file, then leave the game and come back - you will have 0 donuts. The only way to leave yourself with donuts is to keep hitting the homer buddha until you hit a prize, then leave the game.*

* **Here's a video of the hack in action**: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzdoAnD0hqQ

Feel free to post up here if you have any questions or issues.

**DISCLAIMER : I am not responsible for you or your device, this kind of stuff isn't for everyone. If you don't understand it, ask someone who does to do it for you in [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/tappedout/comments/1jommw/help_threads_pay_it_forward/).**

1369344078.0,24,self.tappedout,1exgso,"Selly's big, bossy post about visiting Friends Towns",32,8,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/tappedout/comments/1exgso/sellys_big_bossy_post_about_visiting_friends_towns/,"When visiting a friends town there are several options of what to do, but not all tasks are created equal.


Collecting from a business or home will give you money and exp and for the town Owner it will re-set the timer on that building. 


Homes and businesses have set timers for how long it takes to be ready again, but with Cletu's  Farm and the Weather Station the towns Owner has to set the tasks to start again, and in the case of buildings you can vandalize (spray paint) there is no timer at all.


The best thing to do when visiting is to spray paint a building. The buildings that can be vandalized give no tax money and have no timers, so no matter how long it is from the time you vandalize until the Owner checks their town, the same amount of money and exp is made by both parties. ***Cleaning spray paint off your buildings raises your *Righteousness rating!***


Thusly, cleaning someone else's vandalized building is the worst thing you can do for your friend, as it uses one of your 3 tasks but does not give them any additional reward. Same for the Farm and ~~Weather Station~~ Channel 6  News, there is no reason for you to collect from these, **the exception being to revive someone's wilted crops**, which is always a nice guy thing to do.


The next best things to collect from are the long-timer buildings, Burns Manor and Krabapple Apartment are both 48 hour timers, giving the Owner lots of time to come back and gain from having had friends collect from them. Purple homes are ready every 3 hours but Brown houses only take 4 minutes to be ready again, so unless the Owner comes back in the next 237 seconds, you aren't really helping them very much. Buildings with longer times are a better bet.


A good reason to not collect from houses at all is that if someone has 4 blue houses, and you can only collect from 3, then the timing of one house will be off from the rest. This is slightly annoying for the person with only 4 blue houses, but for someone with a house farm it can really muck up their money system, especially of more than one friend does this.


If you have a lot of friends (because you put your Origin name as your Reddit flair, and lots of people added you!!) then searching for the spray cans when visiting friends and waiting for the slightly longer completion time may seem like too much work, however, Side Show Bob is not always announced! So you might find him while looking for Spray Cans. Catching Bob is part of raising your ****Righteousness Rating.***


Another option is to have your town organized in such a way as to leave the buildings you most like collected from in the middle of the start screen. It is quite possible to do this while still having a nice town layout.



After all that snake non-sense it has occurred to me that we may need an easy way of communicating with each other. I personally am way too lazy to see something in a town, remember the persons name, and then try to find the corresponding person on Reddit to try to convey some information. 



How about the Statue we can all get for free from Homer? Everyone can have the statue, and everyone will have the Simpsons home, we can post on Reddit what the locations mean as they relate to future events. Backyard, frontward, and left or right side of the house can mean certain things. ( I need more eggs = statue in the front yard ) this could potentially also be used to indicate long abscesses. I tend to remove friends if they have been inactive for more than a week or so. If you are just going on vacation or need study time for a while but you will be returning the Statue can be placed in such a away as to let friends know that you'll be back to playing again in a while.


Flair, flair, flair! Origin names set in your flair means you are looking for friends and anyone who plays often should add you. If you only play every few days then please indicate that so similar minded players can also add you.

So after 90 days you would have a grand total of $74,250. So am I right in thinking corn would be a huge waste of time? I would like to hear your thoughts on this.

Edit: So I forgot to take into account the amount of money it takes to plant each, corn is $2000 so after you subtract that out you made $43,000. Sliver tongue is $55 multiply that by 3 = $165 a day, theoretically. So after 90 days its $14,850.

Quick update: I was moving really slow due to computer issues at work, but I'm home now, and picking up speed. If you sent me a PM and somebody else already took care of you, please let me know, so that proper credit is given to those guys. Thanks.

Update 2: laptop is getting hot so I'm taking a smoke break. Remember to send me your email address, not username. Also, I'm unlocking non-whacking day stuff as I go, so if you don't want that, you ONLY want the whacking day stuff, please specify in your pm.

Update 3: it's getting late, I'm gonna have to stop after my last pending pm. Feel free to send me a pm though and if I have time this weekend I'll try to do a few more. Also, I had a lot of messages, so if I accidentally skipped over you, I'm sorry, try to pm me again and I'll try to get to you this weekend as well.

Go into the premium items menu and find Homer Buddha, hold down your devices' power button for a few seconds before clicking to buy HB (you might want to test your device before to see how long it takes to get to the power off screen)
Still holding the power button you should now be able to see the item that HB gave you and have the option to cancel and get that item if it's good, or slide to power off if you don't want it.

In that episode Homer becomes president of the Power Planet Union. At one point Lisa is playing a [""folk style"" song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAacb31bltI) while the workers are on strike. 

Here is my idea. 

Since we are starting to see tasks that require other free members (Fat Tony/Burns, Miss Springfield/Mayor Quimby, Burns/Smithers) to do them and we have the majority if not ALL the power planet workers, I think they could introduce a task that involves Burns/Smithers? and Carl/Lenny/Homer/Lisa. 

* Carl has the task in his options
* Homer/Carl/Lenny holds picket signs outside the main planet building
* Lisa plays her guitar
* Burns and maybe Smithers are inside the building (These two can be omited).
* Be a two-three day task

If they really want, it could be a full side-quest line.

* [New Building] Build ""Painless Dentistry""
* Make Lenny, Carl, and Homer do a ""Plant Shift (16h)"" and Burns ""Run the Plant (24h)""
* Once Burns finished, Have burns give dialog about cutting expenses. 
* Make Burns ""Fire Random Employees (45s)""
* [New Task] Make Lisa go for a ""Teeth Cleaning (30m)"" 
* Marge informs Homer Lisa needs braces.
* Make Lenny, Carl, and Homer do a ""Plant Shift (16h)"" and Burns ""Run the Plant (24h)""
*  Dialog between Lenny, Carl, and Homer about the loss of the Dental Plan. Homer gets made Union President ""D'oh!""
* [New Task] Make Burns and Homer have dinner together(60m). Requires Burn's Mansion.
* Dialog between Lenny, Carl, and Homer. 
* [New Task] ""Make Carl, Lenny, and Homer Strike (2d)."" Must have Lisa free.
* Dialog between Burns and Smithers, followed by Burns talking to Homer about the dental plan.
*  Make Lisa go for a ""Teeth Cleaning (30m)"" 
**End Quest**

After the story line ends, the task for strike is still available.

Painless Dentistry associated task for Springfield Citizens.
 
* ""Teeth Cleaning"" - 30m Bart, Lisa, Ralph, Millhouse, Martin.

1. You can make Homer and Lisa clean up the peices of houses and nucluer waste by telling them to clean up springfeild. I know this is in the tutorial, but I've seen plenty of people with the Halloween update with garbage all over their springfeild.

2. If you accidently send someone to do a job in a building, put that building into storage and they will leave. But it also means that anyone else in the building will leave, too.

3. Don't waste your donuts on the Homer Bhudda. It has never give me anything better that 20 donuts, and I've played it at least 15 times.

4. Make sure to check your conformity meter. It can help you make your Springfield better and give you a ""Conformity Bonus"". This will give you up to 5% more money and make your Springfield look better, too. To improve righteousness, don't vandalize peoples buildings with graffiti. Also, clean other peoples graffiti and ask your friends to vandalize your town so you can clean it up. I also heard that sending Snake and Fat Tony to jail will work, but I'm not entirely sure on that one.

5. Sending someone to do a job for 24 hours will give you less money than sending someone to a 1 hour job 24 times. Check back often to send your Springfielders to do more 1 hour tasks!

6. Tap Homer 10 times in a row to get 10 free donuts and a Jebidiah Springfeild Statue.

7. People only walk on roads, so if you have less roads, the people will be bunched together and save you a lot of time having to look for everyone. I replaced my road with pavement so if I ever want to switch back I know where the road is.

8. Building more houses is a great way to get more money and XP. 

9. You can visit a friends town every 24 hours and get money and XP from their houses. And you don't have to do all of them at once, either. You can do one at 10:00, then come back at 4:00 and do the other two, and there will only be 20:00 hours left. This is useful during the holidays when special currency is used and you can get the currency from friends. Thanks to twinn47 for that one!

10. Speaking of holidays, playing on holidays will often give you free donuts.

I want to get past all of the commotion of the sad demise of the highly successful Tips blog and not waste another second on theories, rumors and speculation. There's a world of people that are now lost without a home for their Tapped Out questions. I am Mike S formerly of tstotips and myself and a few awesome authors and readers of the site have formed to create a new one that will eventually be just as informative and successful as Tips. It is in it's infancy at the moment with all of us authors scurrying to get it full of content but there's no harm in checking it out. There's a permanent Friends page with links to all of the best Tapped Out resources including a link to this subredit, tappedout on Reddit, a place for Origin ID's to add friends, a page for a more social aspect to the game and a general discussion page for whatever. Hope it becomes the go-to for all Tapped Out fans like Tips was. We will be working hand in hand with all of the best Tapped Out resources and hopefully our friend spAnser accepts my invite to have his own page for updates or whatever he wants. There's a ton of stuff on the way and as we grow the site will change to fit the demand. But for anyone interested in witnessing NEW history for the game and see it grow from birth check it out

2)Dirt! I want to make the area surrounding the Muntz house and Cletus' farm look as crappy as it should.  Those buildings need to get the respect they deserve!

That got us wondering if an entire building could be added to the game, could be possible to make other changes to the game that isn't hacking it but enhancing it.  Could it be possible to change the color of items, for example

Change the pavement from slate to brown/tan to provide a dirt road section for wooded areas

Change the pavement/road to red and add a brick pattern 

Change the color of both limos to add some variety

Change the color of the non-character based houses so, instead of having multiple brown houses of the same design, you could have a red one, blue one, etc.

The ideas could be endless and could allow for even more ingenious city designs.

Not being someone who knows how to design anything on a computer, I don't know if these things could even be possible unless they are done by EA themselves.  I thought I read somewhere where spAnser said if he could add the EA building into the game on an official mod he would (don't quote me, can't remember if/where I read it).

I tested this myself but only entered and exited the town or about 10 mins and I was collecting about 1175$ per house I tapped on over the 89 friends I collected on. I netted over $300k in total for about an hours worth of work. 

Not bad. I will try again tomorrow and see if this is consistant. 

The only thing to mention is that if you break the cycle of in/out of your selected ""power up"" town, the cycle will reset. So be careful and don't accidentally hit your home button or a different friends town.

A friend of mine had this problem and had to reinstall the game to fix it, but he didn't lose any progress. However, as of right now, it looks like Origin is having more widespread login problems. I was going to log in to EA's help and file a bug report, but I can't even do that! I can't reset my password or log into my other EA games, like Scrabble.

So I'm waiting until that gets resolved until I try to reinstall the game. I'm hoping that I don't lose anything I do in the meantime, but it wouldn't be that bad if I did. I am really worried that if I try to reinstall, I'll end up losing all of my progress, since I've heard some people have had that problem. 

Has anybody else been having these sorts of Origin problems?

Tapped Out user **aarrroon** here to offer my thoughts on crowd-sourcing eggs in the interest of filling up everybody's egg baskets by the end of May 9.  Thanks to Reddit's generosity and TSTOtips.com(http://tstotips.com/) for inspiring the plan:

* Be Your Own Egg Buddy.
[BlueStacks](http://www.bluestacks.com/) let's you run the app on your computer.  Use the eggs from your 2nd Springfield to spread about the Reddit community
* Set up someone close to you with the app and get them to send you all their eggs (or do it for them if you live with them/see them often).  If they're anything like my girlfriend, they'll think you're crazy to attribute such importance to digital snake eggs and therefore will not care about getting any in return.  The Reddit community wins again!
* [Make It Easier For Your Friends](http://tstotips.com/2013/04/28/how-can-i-make-it-easier-for-my-friends-to-leave-me-eggs/) to collect your snakes by replacing your roads with concrete (see post for details)[here's mine](http://imgur.com/FRATmcc)
* Every 24h, divide your eggs by the number of friends you acquired from an ""Add Me"" thread (linked in the righthand column) and give out that number to each friend as you do their 3 daily interactions.
* Add as many dang buddies you can!

With this method hopefully we can get as many people as close to acquiring all 10 Whacking Day prizes as possible!


TSTO Tips claims 822 snakes a day is reasonably attainable:
[How Many Snakes Is Realistic](http://tstotips.com/2013/04/28/how-many-snakes-is-it-realistic-to-whack-each-day-without-spending-donuts/)

But ""reasonably attainable"" is of course relative:

Yep.  Whut.

So yea after setting some KL missions, I come back... and this.

My Springfield now has the Entrance just sitting on top of stuff, as well as the ring toss.  Also, not pictured, is tons of Krustyland debris.

All of it is selectable/moveable/etc.  However it won't let me inventory any of it.

Tried deleting and reinstalling game (twice), and nothing... so its clearly glitched out on their end.

Any ideas?  Hrrrrmmmmmmm

Edit: Wanted to also say that all of these things LEFT the KL screen.  Ex: Right now, my KL is just Lisa walking around the death drop that is slowly building.  Thinking about using some Donuts to quick finish the death drop and see if it teleports over to my springfield.....

More Edit: I'll stress this isn't just graphic glitch, ala a character replacing a tree.  They are there, moveable, interactable, etc.

Okay so I've learned a couple things from this experience.  A lot of you people would so eat the forbidden donut and most people are way more creative than i am when it comes to town design.  I think i'm done for a bit.  If you already have a pm to me (omg so many) I'll do ya, otherwise im going to take a break once i finish up that first round  I will however, be back hooking up more people later (because Screw EA)

And the flood of people keeps coming.  I'm going to just make a list of the rest of my messages and queue you guys up.

I am no longer doing this until the APK i use is updated.  It can cause errors with springfields if you continue to use the current apk with the new patch.

Random details on my playing:

- I started in October during the Hallowe'en update, it was the first app I downloaded when I got my iPad (it was featured that week).
- Im currently Level 26. About halfway through. I log on at least once a day.
- I'm as far as getting the Burns Manor, and haven't received my next quest 'up' from that yet.
- I have grown corn once. Not really a thing to do with not buying/hacking donuts, just showing off.
- I occasionally visit friends. Mostly because it is a tedious task. Although if I had been doing this i'm sure i'd be a lot further than I am.
- I've yet to experience the harp of doom. I do experience rip cord Bart a lot sometimes though (shitty NZ internet).
- I don't farm houses. I have a few duplicates to make my streets look better, but thats it.


My donut details:


- Christmas was admittedly awesome since I received about 30 donuts when trading in Santa Coins. I only ever got 1 reindeer, I wish I had more :(
- The height of my donuts was about 75, I have only splurged on the Squeaky Voiced Teen and have now got 45.


I never used the hack because I thought it would make the game far too easy. I'm contemplating buying in-game so I can afford to expand my land. I recently started remodelling and have now run out of room (oops), but I kind of enjoy knowing I have to work for it.
Saying that last sentence is odd, because I always used to use the money cheats in the Sims games haha.


SO - **What are the details of your playing?** I'm curious to see where we all stand.

- When did you start?
- What level are you up to?
- How often do you log in?
- What major quest was your last?
- Have you purchased any donuts? How many? What did you buy?
- Have you used the donut hack? How many? What did you buy?
- If you haven't purchased/hacked donuts, how many do you have? How many have you spent? What did you buy?
- Do you visit friends daily? 
- Other details and potential braggery?


Cheers guys! Sorry if this is stupid but i'm genuinely interested. One of the reasons why I love this game is because of the many ways players can go about it.

(Sorry if formatting is odd, i'll repair asap, just not sure if formatting is the same using Alien Blue) Edit: should be a bit better now...

This morning I unlocked shirtless Groundskeeper Willie which means I have 5,000 eggs to collect to unlock all the prizes before the 9th if I want to get everything.

I've not used any donuts so I only have the one snake rock but I do have a full compliment of friends with towns I can go whacking in (sadly a few had their towns deleted and have given up on the game but snakes still appear) - assuming a 50/50 egg to snake ratio that means a maximum of 250 snakes per day if I hunt down every single one. If I combine that with all the snake-generating tasks and the roughly 50ish eggs I get from friends every day I'm not convinced I'll make it. Does Shirtless Willie produce eggs at all or is he like Gymnast Lisa? (I can't find out as I unlocked him while Willie was busy injecting snake poison).

Play a horse race.
As it it is going, go play a lotto (regular, not the .99 one). Scratch the full ticket get your results BUT do not press ok, let your scratched ticket sit there. 

Others have stated you have to time it right, you don't. You just need to finish the scratch off before the race, then if you sit there and watch, as soon as the race ends your scratched ticket goes blank and you can do it again. Timing doesn't matter beyond finishing the scratch off first and waiting.

Then, some people say you have to 1 donut already. FALSE, you have to have 2 or less. Doing this takes away 3 donuts from you, example, today I had 5 when I did it, lost 3, now have 2, and things tell me I don't have enough. By having 2 or less, when it takes 3 you go negative. As long as it goes negative you are fine.

My problem is the donuts. Certainly, I understand that some people are willing to pay for the premium items in this and other games. In some cases, that is true of me as well. That said, I have been hoarding donuts for the longest time and, this time last week, I had about 170 of them. For me, there just hasn't been anything worth spending them on and that's really all there is to that.

In the past couple days however, I've spent all but 50 of them. Why? Because the menus make it far too easy to spend donuts. Simply tapping the info on a premium item can result in an undesired spending of donuts. Honestly, it bothers me that the game is so poorly thought-out (or maybe the opposite) that wasting donuts is so massively easy. I can only imagine how it would feel if I had paid money for them and had now wasted that money on something like Dr. Nick or the many other things I've mis-tapped and purchased..

Rushing quests has it about right. Having the cancel option is excellent in comparison to nothing (even that can go by too quickly to notice, but, I digress). Perhaps a pop up ""Are you sure? Yes|No"" window would be even better. It just seems like the lack of this is a deliberate attempt to make these items (which can be worth actual money to some of us) far too easy to waste.

So is there anything else that should be bought (w/o donuts) that provides something for the main characters? I would have thought that the game would have suggested it in advance.

Thanks.

**Edit** Thanks for the suggestions. So I've checked, and it looks like I have all the non-donut stuff. But looking at the other things, now I have a better idea which things to buy first since the jobs list the times. Four hours, ten hours and 16 hours fit into my schedule, and I can see how many people will use them.

FWIW, the only big item I've bought so far is the Observatory because I thought it would be cool looking. (It was smaller than I expected, but, whatever.) Martin and Skinner use it for 6 hour jobs, which is good for overnight when I just won't have time for 8 hours. 

Everything else I've bought has pretty much been an accident.",TSTO HELP,False,self,t5_2v7cj,1375546002.0,,,True,t3_1jmjns,http://www.reddit.com/r/tappedout/comments/1jmjns/just_discovered_that_a_lawn_chair_gives_brockman/,

As far as I understand, you need 1 donut to try the glitch.

Moleman, Kearney, and Bumblebee Man all cost 60 donuts. Who would you buy and why? I'm looking for the character that is the most fun to have, who has the best missions, etc. If the glitch works, I'll try to buy the others, but if it doesn't, I only can buy one!
