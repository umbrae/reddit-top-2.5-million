Hey guys,

I graduate in a month, and I wanted to pass along all of the various useful stuff that I've accumulated over the years. If you have dropbox, PM me your email and I'll send you an invitation to share the huge folder and you can download whatever you'd like. If you don't have dropbox, you can sign up [here](http://db.tt/uxVmXPt1). 




-------








EDITS:


- Okay everyone, huge response! I'll get the invites rollin' tonight. My apologies for the delay, today I start my last rotation, Radiology (aka Radi-holiday).


- 300 invites sent! **I am no longer sending invites.** Please see my top comments below for more information about accessing the folder.


- Okay, I added a whole lot more, all over the place. Click on ""Events"" on the Dropbox website, and track ""Meddit Dropbox"" for new adds. 


- I believe someone volunteered to upload everything to torrent, so be on the lookout for that. (Thank you, WendellX!)


- **For the Dropbox folk:** Feel free to add any key items to the collection that are missing. Also, some items may be outdated, so if anyone has and updated edition, please drop it in the appropriate folder- but do not delete the old edition. Make sure to do a search first, just in case it's in a different folder. **Please do not delete or move around files!** If you notice that someone deleted a file inappropriately, [you can restore the file](https://www.dropbox.com/help/296). 
- **For non-Dropbox folk:** Finally: [MEDDIT DROPBOX!](http://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/spklb/meddit_dropbox/) Thank you gotlactose for showing me how to share the folder this way!
- For those with insufficient Dropbox storage space, [leave the shared Meddit Dropbox folder](https://www.dropbox.com/help/163), and download as you please from [this link.](http://goo.gl/npdn1)

- Thank you lucidguru for the month of Reddit Gold! 

- **Update:** The torrent is now available [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/sqajn/the_torrent_file_for_all_of_those_pdfs/).

Arrived at the testing center...and their camera isn't working. They sent me home with a phone number to call. I can't reschedule until tomorrow at 8am. I don't know what dates are available or where. I paid for a hotel and gas, not to mention the blood sweat and tears of preparation.

For others it's worse. At least I'm doing a year of master's work. For some in the group, they had plane tickets, family coming into town, rotations to start. 

The fact that Prometric has a monopoly on the licensing exam and is basically exempt from accountability to test takers is the most infuriating part.

    There are some things I want to tell you now, from the perspective of a third year medical student. I don't
know how much I'll change by the time we meet, but if my experience thus far is any indication, 
I won't be the same person I was a decade before I met you, or even in the few years leading up to it. 
That's life, I suppose. Always dynamic and ever changing. I want to write this so that you know where I'm 
coming from and what you mean to me. I also write this so that I can remind myself. I'm human, just like you.


     Contrary to what you may believe, I did not go into this profession for the money. Heck, I will owe ~$300,000
 in debt by the time I graduate medical school and have already amassed ~$20,000 in interest   
during the first few years of my training. I accrue ~$40 in interest a day and when I finally start making my 
modest residency salary next year, it will cost me over $1,000 a month if I paid only interest alone. I went into 
this field because it was the perfect combination of my academic interests (science, medicine, physiology) and 
the ability to really make a difference in people's lives.  I wanted not only to be able to identify your MI and 
activate the cath lab for you when you come in anxious, sweaty, and with an elephant on your chest, but to be
 able to hold your hand when your scan shows a return in your cancer and that unfortunately, it's all over your
 abdominal organs.


    To begin my training, I moved out of state for the first time in my life. I left my family, friends,  a 
relationship, and all familiarity so that I could learn the things I needed to know to be your doctor. I spent many
 nights up into the wee hours of the morning learning about cellular pathways, trying to keep straight all the 
different class I antiarrhythmics, and determining the difference between Niemann-Pick and Tay-Sachs disease, 
trying to remember which one presented with hepatosplenomegaly. During the month before my first board 
exam, I isolated myself to a room full of books, a white board, and markers, sometimes literally sleeping on 
my review materials, only to wake up and do it again the next day. When non-medical school friends I met 
invited me out to do leisurely things, I deferred to the companionship of my First Aid for the USMLE Step I book
 and the USMLE World question bank.


     After having a less than two week summer, spending the last month in social isolation, and suffering through
 the second 7 hour exam of my life, I started on the wards. This was an exciting time for me, as I was finally 
going to be able to practice the things I learned in textbooks. I took out an appendix my first month as a third 
year, recognized splitting in one of my bipolar patients, delivered more babies than I was comfortable with, was
 able to diagnose episcleritis from a physical exam, and inserted a catheter to remove ascitic fluid from a 
jaundiced man's belly. I even circumsized a baby. It was fascinating to see many of the things I read about 
manifested on people, but it was also a sad realization that the heterogenous, enhancing mass on a brain MRI 
meant it was someone's actual glioblastoma or that a stroke can just come and devastate someone who had 
been witnessed as ""fine"" a few hours prior to arrival.


      Life at the hospital was not quite as I expected it. I sat through an end-of-life discussion, where 
my patient was told that he had no further options for chemotherapy/radiation and my attending was pressuring this clearly stunned man into making a hospice decision within the span of about 15 minutes. I heard cynical remarks from people not too ahead of me in training, like when a man who said he was suicidal was dismissed as ""not actually serious"" and another patient was referred to as ""whiny"". I witnessed my residents working their butts off and ""doing all the right things"", yet still staying into later evening hours, finishing charting at home, and then waking up sometimes as early as 03:00 the following day to do it all over again. I often worked my tail off, too, but due to subjectivity of third year grading, ended up with lower remarks than say a classmate who played the same sport in high school as our resident or a fellow student who spent his weekends playing LOL like the attending.


     Outside of the hospital, things were difficult, too. All over facebook, high school or college classmates were 
posting pictures of newly bought houses, adorable photos of their children's first recitals, and engagement 
notices seemed to be a weekly occurrence. Life was moving forward for everyone else around me, but mine 
was kind of frozen for the time being, except the rings on my tree stump continued to accumulate. The happy,
 complete families, the grown up lives, the ability to spend evenings free of studying or looking up presentations 
were all things I was jealous of and did not have. In fact, I was starting to feel increasingly isolated from friends outside of the field. After repeatedly turning
 down invites to hang out or for small get togethers, people stop trying. After spending the longest year of 
medical school mostly at the hospital, in my off time, I've just wanted to stay at home and rest. I ended up
 meeting a friend a year ahead of me at a different school whom I could relate to about things, but feelings 
ensued fast in the months leading up to him leaving, and though we really liked each other, the fates (NRMP
 gods) brought him to a far away place for residency. And I was devastated.


     To my future patient: this has been a very disheartening week. I've questioned my decision to go to medical
 school many times this year, but more so in the past few days than ever before. I feel stressed, lonely, 
anxious about the future, and intermittently question my ability to handle the rigors of residency.  I miss my 
family so much and there are so many feelings that I keep inside because I don't want to worry my mom. She's
 busy enough with my other siblings and I know she would just feel badly that she was far away and ""unable to 
help"". The truth is that having her has been provided me with more than she will ever know.


    Despite all the seemingly only negative thoughts I have poured out onto the screen and the general feeling of
 uncertainty I possess as I enter my final year of medical school, I feel privileged to be here. After only meeting
 me for 15 minutes, you may tell me about your biggest life fears or admit great emotional turmoil. I can 
reassure a tearful you that everything will be perfectly fine when your infant comes in with a febrile seizure. I 
may help you figure out why you constantly get the fluorescent, swirly visual hallucinations you do or just 
provide you with comfort as we wait for you to recover from transverse myelitis. One thing is for certain: 
human beings are incredibly resilient creatures and I am amazed by the drive, optimism, and ability to handle 
devastating news delivered by a stranger in a white coat. Yes, medical school is hard and residency will only be
 harder, but I meet all you amazing people and it makes me remember why I went into this field: to help others
 recover from illness, teach them about disease processes, and be taught by humanity in return. When I step 
into your hospital room and get to talk to you about your troubles, I know that I have made the right decision.


    But I'm also human and everything you feel, I can feel, too. So, if ever you see me not smiling as widely as
 I should be, think I've spent too little time at your bedside, or did not think I sufficiently explained something, 
please at least try to understand that I have my own life stressors and that I struggle to hold my own life 
together in my quest to make yours better. Please let me know that I need to be better because sometimes it
 gets overwhelming and I may, despite all good intention, temporarily forget. Please know that this long, 
arduous journey that I took off on even years before medical school started, I really did it for you. 



Sincerely,


Your doctor

Second rule: don’t talk about medical school. Seriously, nobody cares about gaucher’s disease, osteogenesis imperfecta or all the random things you know about diabetes. They especially don’t care about gossip between emotionally stunted medical students.

Third Rule: Don’t complain about medical school. Despite all the caring and listening doctors purportedly do, nobody cares less about the strife of other doctors like doctors. That goes double for medical students. 

Fourth Real: Gunners get gunned. Realize that though you can get ahead of others by being a note whoring, brown nosing know it all, everyone can and will hate you for it.

Fifth Rule: Grades are like a normal persons income. Only to be shared with close friends and only pompous douchebags brag about it. 

Sixth Rule: The professor is not your tutor, and the lecture is not a conversation. You get two questions per lecture (three if your good). Anything more is wasting everyone’s time. If you seriously don’t get it be a big boy/girl and learn it yourself. 

Seventh rule: When the professor at the end of the lecture asks, “are there anymore questions?” that in no way means ask a question. That means I’m done and if you have a question come talk to me after class where all of the people who actually care will be and those that don’t will not be forced to stay and shoot you dirty looks across the room. One can only not pay attention for so long. 
 
Eighth Rule: If there is a Facebook group that everyone shares, do not post stuff frequently. Facebook allows student’s to escape from medical school however briefly and nothing ruins that more than your pointless article, not funny comment, or useless announcement clogging up my updates.

Ninth rule: During a test, do not in anyway disturb the people around you or suffer the wrath of God. 

Tenth rule: Don’t correct another student, or try to teach another student anything while in front of an attending or anyone of any importance unless specifically asked. You may be punched in the face and none of your peers will feel bad for you.

1329668434.0,81,self.medicalschool,pwimn,A few questions about the direction of r/medicalschool,97,16,51,http://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/pwimn/a_few_questions_about_the_direction_of/,"Hey guys and gals,

I'm a pretty active poster here on r/medicalschool, but recently I've been thinking this subreddit isn't headed in the direction it should. Currently, on the front page:

9 of the links posted are by premeds asking questions about how to get in, what it's like, etc.

2 links are someone (I assume a lay person) asking about medical problems.

8 links are memes, funny videos, etc.

3 links are helpful study materials for medical students.

3 links are posts by medical students asking questions to other medical students.

Now, I realize the sidebar says that this subreddit is for ""current medical students as well as rising pre-medical students,"" but with the introduction of [/r/premed](/r/premed), I think it might be best to amend the sidebar and purpose of this sub. Whenever I come to [/r/medicalschool](/r/medicalschool), I want to read about and talk to other med students about being in med school. I don't know how all the other medical students on here feel, but I don't have to worry about whether or not my GPA is high enough, or what to do to prepare for the new MCAT, or how I can set up volunteering, and I hate having to wade through a bunch of premed posts to find the content on this sub that I'm actually interested in.

I'm not against helping out premeds who have questions or want to know what it's like, in fact I really enjoy it but that is what [/r/premed](/r/premed) is for, not [/r/medicalschool](/r/medicalschool). I subscribe to both, and I try to answer questions over on premed pretty frequently, but I think it would be nice to be able to filter the content a little more effectively.

Obviously, my opinion alone doesn't count for much, and if the community is fine with premed posts flooding the front page, then I've got no room to complain. [Here is a thread from about a month ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/nmoqd/the_reasons_why_i_am_unsubscribing_from_this/c3aaxfb) discussing this same topic, in which several subscribers felt the same way. I hope the mods will also weigh in on this and let us know how they feel about it.

So, what does everyone think? 

**Edit:** At risk of jumping the gun since this post has only been up since this morning, I'm going to say that many of you feel the same way I do about what is/isn't appropriate for this sub. To clarify some points--I don't mind meme posts if it's something other med students can relate to. I've even [submitted a few myself](http://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/nbne2/whenever_i_hear_freshman_complaining_about_school/). I also think this is a good place for *accepted* students to ask questions (""What books should I buy?""). As BillyBuckets stated, ""This should be a post-acceptance reddit."" He pretty much sums up in one sentence what I said over 5 paragraphs. I'm going to message the mods and try to open a discussion to see where they stand and go from there. Thanks for all your comments! Happy studying!

**Edit 2:** creator11 has [opened a public discussion](http://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/q012d/shall_we_begin_active_moderation/) about the pros and cons of more active moderation. Please stop by and post what you think so we can decide as a community the best direction for this subreddit!

I'm sure we all have some gems lying around in the back of our minds.  Sometimes a good video is crazy useful.  Here are my favorites:

* [Shotgun Histology](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLD7882068A01C370F) on YouTube is incredible.  I used it during the entire histo block.  This guy also does videos on pathology that I have never tried, but he does an awesome job of keeping histology quick and dirty.

* This guy's [Handwritten tutorials](http://www.youtube.com/user/harpinmartin?feature=watch) are great for lots of different topics, check out his channel to see his offerings.  It is helpful to draw along with him; it is similar in style to Dr. Najeeb's work.

* [This](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssKoVTWV99s) is the best explanation of audio transduction I have ever seen.

- Get my white coat... I'm so proud!
- First months, alright, fuck yeah, I'm a medical student. I'm going to study the shit out of this stuff.
- Wears scrubs in public to show off, eager to tell people he's a medical student
- I've done well on some exams, maybe I can take it a bit easier...
- Takes anatomy practical...WTF WAS THAT SHIT?
- Sinks into a major depression, thinks about quitting and dropping out. Posts such thoughts on SDN.
- Slowly recovers over the summer but realizes how bored I am without school and actually look forward to going back

Year 2

- Starts pathology and pharmacology
- Becomes a hypochondriac
- Realizes that most diseases have no cure and becomes disillusioned with the profession
- But overall more interesting
- Crams like mad for Step 1
- Learns more from USMLE World than during two years of school
- Does well on Step 1 and feels rejuvenated and excited about his future

Year 3

- First rotation: Feels so hopelessly ignorant and awkward. All confidence gained in first two years is totally shattered. Takes first Shelf exam, goes home and cries.
- Second rotation: Attending treats me and resident like shit. Everyone's unhappy. Weather gets cold. Starts to hate his life once again.
- Third rotation: Alright. More of the same. Dreads working on the wards.
- Fourth rotation: Is there no end in sight? Why are these rounds taking so long!
- Fifth rotation: OMG, it's my last week of third year and I still feel totally fucking stupid. I'm going to be a horrible intern.

4th year

- No more Shelf exams? It can't be, can it? Oh, wait, step 2. Painfully wades through USMLE World once again. Yep, I am truly dumb. Confidence is shattered once again.
- Sub-internship: Hmm, I actually might know what I'm doing a little bit. Maybe I actually can do this!
- Avoids wearing white coat whenever possible
- Hopes no one asks him what he does because he doesn't want to talk about medical school
- Applies for Step 2 CS. $1000 + travel?? FU!
- Fills out ERAS. Medical school awards? T_T $1000 again? FU!

Found little to no advice on HOW to pay for medical school.

Before I start, I want to point newcomers to a few resources.

The AAMC has an AWESOME resource called AAMC FIRST. 99% of your questions on medical school financing can be found here. Topics extend to long PDFs to concise 40 minute powerpoints on just how it all works. I spent about a week combing the website. 

Here is the [link](https://www.aamc.org/services/first/)

Now, to my question. As an incoming MS1, how exactly are you all financing your medical education? For all of us, the MORE specific you are, the better it is. I have something like this in mind:

Cost of Attendance: $__________ (tuition plus living expenses. Elaborate if you feel the need to)

Loan breakdown (if applicable): 

*Stafford: $_________ at 6.8% APR

*Grad PLUS: $_________ at 7.9% APR

*Private: $________ at _____% APR from (bank name/lender)

*Scholarship (if applicable): $_________

*Out of Pocket (and how, if applicable): $_______ 

Any other details you think are relevant!

I'll get you all started. FIU Med here.

COA: $65,000 (approximately...massive rounding up though)

Stafford: $42000 at 6.8% (I think I'll be accepting this)

Grad plus: 0, because I think I can get a lower APR from a private loan (thank god cosigner)

Private: $7,500 at an unknown APR (at the moment, i suspect it'll be 6.0% or lower) from Wellsfargo/Discover (still debating)

So, i was thinking, maybe we should tell each other about it.

Location: Graz, Austria
Me: M, 23, currently in 6th (last year)

So in Austria you enter med school after highschool. That means 18 for  most girls, 19 for most guys (mandatory 6 months of military, eugh)

It lasts **12** semesters (6 years)

**Admission:** You have to pass a test in July which is a combination of science (biology, chemistry etc.) and intelligence type questions. 360 are admitted each year , last year about 1800 participants took the test. Our university has about 4500 students (med, dental, nursing, doctoral students combined) You start in october.

**Curriculum:** Every year you have 6 modules (3 per semester). A module lasts usually about 5 weeks. After that module there is the main date for the ""module-exam"" which is multiple choice most of the time. Lectures are optional, for seminars and practice you have to be there 85% of the time. Depending on the seminars, there can be little interim exams (anatomy takes them very seriously)

The first and second semester are preclinical. Chemistry, physics, anatomy, biochemistry, embryology, histology and stuff. Third semester is biochem and physiology. Fourth semester is pathology, pathophysiology and pharmacology. This is **by far** the hardest one. After that you have clinical modules. In every modules you have different disciplines mixed up. M29 for example is ENT and dermatology, M14 is radiology combined with statistics, M23 is orthopedics and traumasurgery.

During the first five years you have to do 16 weeks of rotations in specialties of your choice. (you can do 16 weeks of psychiatry, if that makes you happy, usually everyone does at least 4 weeks of internal medicine and 4 weeks of surgery)

6th year is purely clinical, no more exams. You have to do 10 weeks of surgery/anesthesiology 10 weeks of internale medicine and 5 weeks of your choice. Additionally you have to do 6 weeks with a general practitioner. (the 31 weeks are bumped up to 48 weeks soon)

You have to write a thesis to finish you study.

**Finances:**Yeah, so in Austria, studying is completely free at the moment. For a few years (2006-2012) you had to pay 370€ per semester, because politics. So usually you leave med school w/o any debts.

I would be interested how your system is (you don't have to write as much as I did, though :) )

I've been having some serious personal issues this year, and it has made studying almost impossible, I just sit there and zone out for hours on end thinking about everything.  I'm just so lost and have no idea what to do from here.  I've been sitting on my couch, alone, doing nothing, for hours.  I don't know how I'm going to tell my family...they're going to be so disappointed, just thinking about it makes me sick to my stomach.  

So I guess hit me with your best advice, I'm just so angry/scared/nervous/alone...

Edit: Thanks everyone, this has helped me feel a bit better about things.  A few friends came over this morning to cheer me up, we made an awesome breakfast and now we're having an Marvel marathon before going to see Avengers tonight.

I'm currently enrolled in med school but still can't let go of everything I learned while geeking out on the computer.  Lately I've been wanting to combine what I learn in medical school with some kind of website...that isn't too hard to manage at the same time.  My current idea is to create a website that is a simple, yet elegantly/efficiently designed index of videos ranging from histology...to anatomy...to even general talks.  Along with a Q&amp;A that users can post to for each video.  Along with that I was thinking about having a resources section on the website also that just had useful links info etc..

As of now I haven't found one website that indexes med school resources very efficiently.  There is studentdoc network, meddit, etc..but I just wanted to create a more simplified form of it all, where a student can go, search, and learn. 

Maybe something like this already exists or maybe this idea is just dumb.  OR maybe you have a better idea all together and we can get together to make it happen.  What are your thoughts!!??

I feel like they have done nothing but help me develop and grow as a person. I have spent a lot of time reading the literature about these drugs. Recently, there has been a serious upswing in the amount of research done with psychedelics, the majority of which is [positive](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22905130). I am curious as to what the general feeling is amongst other medical students about these drugs. 

Are you okay with people responsibly using these types of drugs? Do you use them? What drugs do you think are okay for people to use? Do you think more research should be done on these compounds? 

Responsible use is key here. I'm not talking about smoking weed everyday or taking mushrooms on a weekly basis. I recognize there is a problem here with a definition for 'responsible use.' I am also not saying that people cannot get carried away and end up with a substance use disorder. That certainly exists and those people have a problem. I also think that people with a psychiatric history or a family history of psychiatric disorders should not be using these substances. I am not talking about cocaine or heroin or other highly addictive and damaging substances. 

I have found that in my school there are very few students who are actually educated about these types of drugs. The attendings and the residents even less so. To me it is a very interesting topic, especially in light of the findings of [recent research](http://www.maps.org/research/).

So if you need some advice or help, come find me. I know how much the process sucks, and I feel for all of you, so I'll do anything I can to help.


EDIT:  I have a suggestion.  If I've helped any of you out at all, and you feel like you can spare $10, you can repay me by going to r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/ and helping out someone who really needs it.  Of course, you're all mostly college students, so if you're broke, then don't worry about it.  Just remember all this when you're a resident one day and you see clueless medical students walking around.  Help them out, because they need it.

EDIT2:  When I first offered this, it was because I wanted to help people out.  I thought I'd be giving more advice, giving out information, helping people with their decisions.  Instead I've become a personal statement editing service.  So, I won't be looking at personal statements anymore.  It's too time consuming, and it's really not beneficial to you guys.  There are plenty of people who can read those things for you.  However, if any of you need an attending to talk to and need advice or help with anything, please come talk to me.  

Also, guys, it's just a personal statement.  It's like the 6th most important thing on your application.  Come talk to me about real things that matter: specialty choices, how to study, how to apply, how to conduct yourself.  I still want to help, so please feel free to come to me with anything.

Like the title says, I come from an unranked state school and just matched into a competitive specialty of my dreams.  I remember having a ton of questions, and now in a blink of an eye I'm on the other side of the craziness that is fourth year.  

As a frame of reference: I went on 30 interviews (19 advanced, 11 prelim) and did two away rotations earlier in the year.  So I have seen a LOT of hospitals.  

There may be no questions and thats totally fine, but if there are I wanted to give back!  So, ask me anything! 

Edit: Thanks for all the great questions so far!  I have to step away from the computer for a bit, but feel free to to continue asking and I'll answer when I get back!

Edit 2: Alright guys, that about does it for me.  Obviously I'll still be around, so feel free to ask more questions but there may be a delay before I answer.

My partner had to interview the 5-year-old brother while the other two watched.  The other 5-year old (we'll call him Bobby), was a little hyper, and obviously jealous of the attention.  He climbed onto the examining table along with the patient, and would try and get attention.  He would grab at his friend's stuffed animal and bop him on the head (while the otoscope was in the patient's ear!), try to answer questions aimed at assessing development, and so on.  Finally, my partner got fed up and, in order to distract the kid, started shining his flashlight around on the ground, saying ""what's that! what's that!"", like you would when you're playing with a cat.  I thought it was a little silly, but it worked.  The kid was instantly fascinated by the light on the ground, and followed it with his eyes.  Finally, after the 2nd or 3rd time my partner did this, the kid got really excited and leaped off of the examining and pounced right onto the light, just like a cat would pounce onto a laser pointer.  The look on his face when he opened his hands and the light was gone was exactly like the look a cat makes when the laser has gone: ""wtf happened?? it disappeared!""

http://www.osteopathic.org/inside-aoa/Pages/ACGME-single-accreditation-system.aspx

I felt like this was pretty one sided while reading it so I ran a google search on an ACGME or MD update and found this:

http://www.acgme.org/acgmeweb/Portals/0/PDFs/Nasca-Community/NascaLetterGMECommunityJune142013.pdf


So the way I understand it, in a simplified way is this:

1. AOA says we want some of our core competencies retained if we do agree on one system. ACGME is cool with it.
2. Talks continue, ACGME submits a Memorandum of understanding (MOU) to the AOA to approve if they are going to move forward (I have no idea what was included in this MOU, apparently it won't be released until after a decision is reached. A decision was announced today).
3. AOA rejects the MOU. Talks are halted.

Does anyone have an insight on whether or not this is going to get done? I understand the AOA is big on carrying this distinction of being a DO... but I'm concerned that osteopathic medical students are constantly getting screwed on the decisions they are making. If talks end here, and no agreement is reached, people going into AOA residencies eventually hoping to specialize are going to be fucked by ACGME limitations on AOA trained physicians or by lack of AOA fellowships. /rant

Help me out with this if you can. I'm really not happy about the MOU getting rejected today.

""Many studies have shown that the prevalence of psychological distress among medical students during medical training is higher than that in general population. A few studies have shown that the prevalence of psychological distress among medical students before the onset of medical training was similar to general population. This study aimed to investigate psychological health of medical students before and during medical training. A one-year prospective study was done on successful applicants who undergo the first year of medical training for 2010/2011 academic session. The stress, anxiety and depression were measured by the DASS-21 at five intervals; during interview (Time 0), two months (Time 1), four months (Time 2), six months (Time 3) and final examination (Time 4) of the first year medical training. The prevalence of unfavourable stress, anxiety and depression before the onset of medical training was 4.1%, 55.6% and 1.8%, respectively. The prevalence of unfavourable stress during medical training ranged between 11.8% and 19.9%. The prevalence of anxiety during medical training ranged between 41.1% and 56.7%. The prevalence of depression during medical training ranged between 12% and 30%. Mean scores of stress and depression before (Time 0) and during medical training (Time 1–4) were significantly different (p &lt; 0.001). The prevalence and level of unfavourable stress and depression during medical training were significantly higher than before the onset medical training. This study supports views that medical training is not an optimal environment to psychological health of medical students.""

I am currently a fourth year medical student who should be getting my application ready to apply for residencies. Instead, I find myself languishing the days away in bed or in front of my computer. Throughout all of medical school, I have been struggling with major depression on top of a sleep disorder, and that has been difficult enough. But there are also weeks at a time, that occur every so often, when symptoms are more pronounced, and it becomes arduous and exhausting to even arrive on time at my clinical sites.

Currently, I am on my anesthesia rotation. This is an important rotation for me, because anesthesia is what I hope to do.  However, due to these problems, I’ve missed quite a number of days. I was hoping to use this as an opportunity to get some letters of recommendation, but I’ve squandered it. 

So not only do I feel like I have screwed myself over even as far as applications go, but I have also become really worried about the prospect of intern year. I know that it will be very demanding, and it will be impossible for me to fulfill those responsibilities it at this rate.

I’ve talked with student affairs in the past; they seem mostly interested in confirming that I am not suicidal (I’m not) and then refer me to a psychiatrist. I’ve been seeing a psychiatrist for 2 years now, and various medications have not really brought about much change in any of my symptoms yet. So I am not sure where else to turn. The idea of taking time off has been suggested, but since I need to be using this time to apply for residencies, this may be the worst possible time to take a leave of absence. Additionally, I’m not sure what taking time off would accomplish.

I guess my questions are: Is it impossible for me to be or even become a doctor? Have I kissed my chances at having an acceptable application goodbye? Has anyone else dealt with major depression or sleep disorders through medical school? How did they challenge you, and what helped you?

EDIT: I want to thank everyone for their advice and concern, and I want to apologize for not responding sooner. I was able to talk with student affairs and the anesthesia clerkship director; I have moved some rotations around in my schedule to allow for some time off without having to take an actual medical leave (but the option is there should I need it). Additionally, I was offered some make-up dates for anesthesia, and the clerkship director is keeping these issues between us. I have to say, everything has worked out better than I thought it would. I was surprised at the understanding that everyone showed. Still, I have to focus on getting better--I've agreed to meet with a therapist on a regular basis (something I'd not been doing before) and I have a new appointment with a psychiatrist to adjust my meds.

Again, thanks for all your support.

She was first diagnosed with non-hodgkin's lymphoma in 2005 and entered a trial at Sloan where she was treated, and the lymphoma has never been seen again. Early 2013 she was diagnosed with a form of cancer called pseudomyxoma peritonei. The biggest problem with this cancer is that is indolent and doesn't respond well to chemotherapy. There's so much other information I want to tell you but to keep this short I'll get right to the point...

Recently she has begun following an Alkaline pH diet. It is more strict than being on a vegan diet. *There is no scientific evidence that this diet can prevent or cure cancer in vivo*. I don't know why she believes in it, but she does. As a medical student I want to talk to her about this, but her spirits are up and she has been feeling so good. She will not be refusing conventional cancer treatments, but in her case, 2 different panels of oncologists and surgeons at renowned cancer centers have told her that her best option is to ""wait and watch"" before proceeding with either Major surgery or Intraperitoneal chemotherapy.

What am I to do? Should I let her continue with this diet believing that it is helping her? (Even though it is extreme, she actually doesn't seem to mind, at all). I also am a firm believer in the placebo effect which is supported by scientific evidence. If simply believing that you are being healed can actually heal, who am I to pop her bubble?

I went to a relatively easy college. Didn't focus much on school but it was an easy school so I managed a 3.73 cumulative. Took the MCAT after graduation, did exceptional bad. I ended up taking the MCAT 4 times. Highest score being a 26. Applied to and got accepted to a school in the caribbean for obvious reasons. I failed my first year, badly. Went and got some testing and was told I had reading, writing and math learning disabilities and ADHD. Major deficiency were processing speed and verbal long term memory. I don't know if I really do have LDs, but that's what the psychoeducational assessment concluded.

School allowed me to retry. For midterms got 2 Bs and failed the third exam. A lot of the stuff in the first half I was somewhat familiar with but since midterms everything is very new to me and it almost all seems like a blur. Ive made some drastic changes recently and I think I will be able to correct the mistakes I've made (yet again.)

Its just so frustrating to study and then not remember enough the next day. To have other students blow you off or roll their eyes during group times or have smirks on their face as they pass you in the hall. But thats okay. I see other kids talk about material week after week with ease and I'm just sitting there trying to follow. But thats okay because these are the same kids that didn't have much to say during talks on ethics.

It sucks and its hard but im not blaming these so called LDs I have. its my fault for not studying the right way. and Im just rambling at this point.

I would like to make the case for taping lectures at my school, and so I'm asking you guys to weigh in on the subject with either (1) reasons that you think lectures should or shouldn't be recorded, or (2) links to evidence of positive or negative results after medical schools start taping their lectures.

2) Like the article says GYM GYM GYM. It relieves stress and provides you the body you need to carry on.

3) Try different studying techniques early on, I switched to maybe 4 different ways of studying until I found an efficient one for me. I may even end up changing this technique, actually come to think about it, I suppose it depends on the class/professor.

4) Delete Facebook and stop going on Reddit. My reasoning for this is; you won't procrastinate as much and you'll be more efficient in your studies. Because truthfully, you'll ACE MS1 if 2 or 3 hours a day is spent on actual study time. That time when you're in the zone.

5) Enjoy what you study, I hate anatomy, I like drawing, guess how I end up studying anatomy...

6) Treat yourself at least twice a month. This may mean drinking, smoking, pigging out, whatever. My personal thing was to smoke a lot of cigarettes, hookah, and play fifa with some other students for 10 hours.

7) Try and not make any enemies with your peers. You're stuck with them for the next few years. 

8) If you're an MBBS student like me, don't remind yourself about matching for residency. It only distracts you.

9) Do not hesitate in asking, be it your professor, another student, a fellow redditor, or the janitor on campus. ASK QUESTIONS when you have something on your mind.

10) Some people masturbate almost everyday, I try not to. But when I do it's before the night of an exam.

11) OSCE's stay confident, I'm often times timid with people who are my superiors. During an OSCE is the last place to do so. 

12) Are you working a part-time job? QUIT.

13) Are you broke? Ramen.

Near the beginning of this year she slipped into a depression due to a relationship issue. She has been seeing a psychiatrist and a therapist, and has been trying new Rx drug combinations, but she has been suicidal and depressed for several months without much improvement. Her med school friends are drifting away. I am trying to be a supportive friend from afar, but there is not much I can do (especially as a non-professional).

Due to her personality type, she has said that she absolutely cannot drop out of med school, and her chances of becoming a doctor after ""taking time off"" would be completely obliterated.  Recently, though, she's been saying that she doesn't know if she can handle being depressed and being in school.  

My question is: can med students take time off from school and hope to return at some point?

From 0 to jaded in 2 years.,54,35,135,http://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/1fc32v/changes_in_perspective_during_med_school_from_0/,"Before I started, I had more than a handful of people warn me about going into medicine.  A Dr. I shadowed told me to be an insurance salesman.  A friend in medical school warned me it isn't worth it.  Of course, at the time I just shrugged it off and became more sure of my decision.  
Now, after 2 years of med school, I have a different perspective.  I have enjoyed school, and I know I picked the right career for myself, but every time I read about someone in premed I cringe a little and feel like warning them to go into a different field.  

Mostly I want to warn them about med school turning into the new law school. Way too many med schools pumping out way too many doctors for a relative few number of residencies.  People getting out of school with 300k in debt and few job opportunities.
 
Then, when you are finished, things aren't quite what you had hoped for during undergrad.  I have found out so much about medicine that for some reason I just ignored while premed, namely how insurance runs the show and dictates how you will treat your patients.   Then there are the nurses and PAs moving in with their superior lobbyists and unions, meaning many of the jobs you decided to pursue before even starting might not be available.  I don't really believe the last point, but it certainly is a pervasive notion at my school.  


I still encourage everyone who asks me about it, but in the back of my mind I feel like telling them to sell insurance.

So, first year med student. I like the course until now, but all those classes bother me and I can't really say I learn a lot from them. Mostly, I can retain something between 10%~15% of all the information given in a two-hour lecture.

However, in the first biochemistry one I had 9,4, best grade in class, and I just read and took notes from Lehninger, never really attended any lecture. 

That being said, I think not going to class anymore (excluding some special classes by truly great teachers) might, and just might, be a good idea. Any other redditors here do that? Tips, other ideas and recommendations are taken!

I'm a first year student. My grades are for the most part average. My school for the most part is average. I'm not really used to being average, but I'm coping with it.

The thing is, I am seeing all my friends going on moving to great cities (Boston, NYC, DC) and having fun, settling down with significant others and yet I'm stuck in a crappy city and it seems like I'll be stuck here for 3 more years. I'm not happy. I have a lot of trouble connecting with my classmates on a personal level, as it seems that many don't have hobbies other than getting drunk after exams, and while I am not a person who consumes alcohol, I still go to the parties and bars, but it doesn't do much for me just seeing my classmates get progressively more drunk. I have tried to organize movie plans, superbowl plans, other hangouts, and people either aren't interested in the movie (who didn't want to see Django?), don't like sports (a ton of people told me they didn't plan on watching the super bowl...)

To make matters worse, my ex-girlfriend (who lives in NYC) and I split 5 months ago, and she just told me she has started to see someone else. We were great together, and the break up was amicable, but I still got depressed because she was pretty much the only person I was talking to on a regular basis. On the plus side, I was proud of myself to maintain my average grades in the face off heartbreak. 

I now am trying to find other girls that I could befriend and possibly become intimate with, but there is a problem. I can only date girls of my own race. I know. It's close minded, but its a cultural pressure imposed upon me, and to be honest, that is who I am attracted to. But the thing is, my school is small, not many girls of my race get accepted a year (maybe 1-2, but often 0) and the girls are typically are 3-4 years older than I am (I am 21 and my classes average age is 24-25. Women from my culture don't like dating men who are younger).

To make matters worse, I feel like I should just avoid girls for a year and a half to just focus on the boards, so I can get a good Step 1 score and match in a cool city and get a taste of that NYC life or something that I see my friends enjoying while I'm still young, and hopefully I can meet someone there.

But I'm nervous. I'm average at an average medical school. How good can my Step 1 score be? How can I start preparing this summer? There must be a little something I can do. I need some guidance on how to attack this test because to be honest, if my board score is good, I won't mind the last two years of medical school because I know I will match somewhere I like.

I don't believe we're the *Best Country Evar!!!11!*  ... **so I don't understand why so many IMGs are obsessed with getting an American residency**.

And I firmly believe the word ""obsession"" *isn't* an exaggeration: many of them are obsessed.  Yes, on the internet, we only hear the most vocal of them (just like most internet pre-meds seem obsessed with getting into medical school) - but at least with the pre-meds, it makes some sense.  You 100% cannot be a doctor if you do not go to medical school.

But IMGs *have* gone to medical schools.  They *are* doctors!  But they still aren't satisfied until they get that coveted American residency spot.

And I'm not talking about Americans who went to the Carribean or wherever and have planned on coming back from the very beginning - that's understandable.  They want to go back to their home country, and most people would do the same.  No, I'm talking about people who identify culturally with the nation they were born and raised in, want to RETURN there to practice as a physician, but want to leave and are willing to pay thousands of dollars to be able to do so.

For someone in Thailand, Korea, China, Vietnam, Qatar, Jordan, or wherever to have all of their relatives nearby, believe that family is the most important thing in the world, make it into medical school, and then.... not just LEAVE for america, but spend at least a year studying for arbitrary American tests full-time for the sole purpose of coming here and staying?  And applying for the J-1 visa, which is so beaurocratic it's practically a full-time job in itself?  And stressing out not only over Step 1, 2, and 3, but also for Step 2 CS because of possible accent issues?

Holy crap, so much work and effort... for what?  Especially when so many of them are open to wanting to go back to their home country to practice!  Why deal with the stress and years away from home?

Big hospitals
Harvard doctors

I personally get provoked by the idea of a cameraman filming patients relatives as they just land with helicopter and are 20 minutes from loosing their relative.

Sorry if this is a dumb question, but my school hasn't done our ""planning for M4/residency application season"" class meeting yet, so I am pretty in the dark right now.

Basically, who should we be getting letters of recommendation from? I am probably going into radiology, and from what I understand, they don't care about radiology letters and just want medicine/surgery/etc letters.

So do you get letters from specific attendings you worked with? Or get letters from your clerkship director, even if you didn't work directly with them in a clinical setting? Do they put together ""consensus"" letters that reference the attendings you worked with? Also, when do you ask these people for letters? I feel they'll forget me fairly quickly once the next batch of students rushes in.

I'm almost halfway through my rotations and I don't feel there are that many attendings who actually see much of the fruits of my work. It's mostly residents.

**Edit: Thank you guys very much for all the thoughtful and heartfelt replies.**

**I see your collective point that at the beginning you don't really know how to handle the stress and volume of information coming at you.

Hopefully at some point in the near future I'll settle into a routine that handles the info and get's me the grades I want while allowing time for my spouse.**

**One thing that I think is scaring me into this hypertensive situation is that I'm not sure what I want to do residency wise &amp; and one interest of mine is very competitive. I don't want to get to third year doing mediocre, decide that's what I love and already be excluded from the running. I just wish I knew now if I have to bust my ass or not. **

**So I think I'll have to start following your advice of setting limits on my schedule. Studying for a set period of time and then scheduling time off to relax. I love my SO and I don't think I could ever replace her if we were to split during this really trying time. She's also really hard working and driven so hopefully she can understand what I'm going through. Like you guys said, I need to start showing her I haven't forgotten her (at least in some small way) and that she's still a priority.

I received a low pass in OB/Gyn.  It was a miserable experience.  I did not deal well with the pressures put on me by the work environment, residents, or nurses in OB.  I tried to be friendly to patients but they took it as aloofness.  My interactions with residents were awkward because I was anxious about working in such a stressful environment.  Patients complained about me, the residents were passive aggressive towards me, no one gave me any feedback.  By the time I went to midterm review, I found out that the people I worked with had serious problems with me.  I became even more anxious and felt depressed.  Interacting with people became even more uncomfortable.  I got the opportunity to work with the other half of gyn, and things got much better, but I still was uncomfortable, and nervous.  I just got my review, they called me arrogant and aloof.  That I was bored and didn't care.  None of those things are me.  I cared deeply about everything that went on.  I had just grown to be terrified of working with the group I was with.  I hated my experience, and every single day was like torture, knowing that I would never be able to make it out of the hole I was in.  I have to go in front of a school committee for a performance review in half a month.

Is there a first principles way to know which antibiotics to use when, or is the something I have to rote learn?

Returned and got an email a few days later greeting us and telling us about orientation. All was well until I saw the portion mentioning a drug test (!) which is in about 2 weeks from today. I am super worried since I am not sure if I will pass though the weed was ingested in a country in which it is legal. I've had a lot of friends go through this school and none of them got drug tested. It may be something new they're implementing. Any advice? Pretty nervous about failing. It would be awful to lose my admission.


EDIT:

Figured I'd update you and also add this in case someone comes back to this thread. I ended up passing no problem even though I was sweating bullets. In any case, it wasn't my school that actually tested but the hospital we are affiliated with. Since our school is on hospital property we all have to pass drug tests as part of the hospitals drug free policy. The faculty at our school were very forthright and honest about it and I feel like they would have let us take it much later if someone had asked. Also, they said if you fail you would get transferred to our other campus instead of getting kicked out since the other campus does not have a drug free policy because they are not actually on hospital property (weird, right?) during the first two years. Although, it would be quite awkward to have to transfer due to a failed test since all the faculty will know you had to transfer because you were on drugs (small school, 100 students, so everyone knows everyone). No one failed which was good, it was also reassuring to meet some other students who were as nervous about it as me :) Some of the second years were very helpful about it too since I was so nervous, and they answered a lot of my questions. Matter of fact, they were the ones who sent out the email alerting us to the test. They said they wanted us to know so we had a couple weeks to clean up our act.

During breaks, I get asked a lot about the “lifestyle” of my specialty and I've written about it before in my blogs. *(SPOILER: The lifestyle of a Reproductive Endocrinologist is not bad, but not as easy as some would think.)*

I'm curious about your answers to this question:

 **For those of you who weigh lifestyle as an important factor in YOUR future choice of specialty, what specifics do you consider as important for an ideal lifestyle?**

Some factors to consider:

- Total hours worked per week: Do you want to work 80 hours per week? 60? 20?

- Shift mentality vs round-the-clock commitment: Do you care that when you leave work, you have zero to worry about?  Are you willing to be available by phone to field questions? Do you need to know that when you’re out with friends/family that you’re not going to get called in for an emergency?

- Flexibility of time off: Do you need to be able to take off for weeks at a time and feel confident that your patients are being taken care of?

- Intraday flexibility: Do you value the ability to set your own pace throughout the day, take ample 10-15 minute breaks every few hours in between patients in order to unwind (and go on Reddit) or do  you not mind not-stop action for hours on end where you would be lucky to even get a bathroom break?

- Circadian factors: Daylight work hours only? Or are graveyard shifts OK.

I have a personal bias from observations over the years that the medical student of 2012 is much pickier about lifestyle than the medical student of 1990 was. That’s actually a GOOD thing, because while it’s great for the patients to have “workaholic” self-sacrificing doctors, it’s not necessarily good for the doctor and his/her family. Patients benefit from having doctors who are happy and mentally healthy. Somewhere there is an optimal balance.

Here in France it's like this :

After high-school you apply to a a medical school of your choice 

* first year is the PCEM 1 (Premier Cycle d'Etudes Médicales 1 (Which has recently been renamed to PAES)), at the end of the first year only a certain amount of students are allowed to pass on. The total number of second year is set by the Ministry of Health. Currently it is set at 7400, which translates roughly to a 15% passing rate for the first year students.

* Second year is PCEM 2, the material covered during the first two year is somewhat like what Americans cover during pre-med/

* Third to Six year are called DCEM (Deuxième Cycle d'Etudes Médicales) 1 to 4. During the first 3 you cover all the material for Epreuves Classantes Nacionales at the end of the DCEM 4. The ECN is a big exam taken simultaneously by all 6th year med-school students (all 7400 of them), depending on your ranking you may choose both your specialty and where you wish to work. If you want to be able to work in Paris you have to be amongst the first 3300. During the whole DCEM yhe day is divided into being at the hospital in the morning and going to class the afternoon.

* After that you enter the TCEM, you gain the status of intern. To finish your studies you have to take a certain amount of specialty courses, and write a thesis.

I would appreciate an explanation to this because the textbook and notes do not help things because they expect me to already know the distinction. 

I'm too embarrassed to ask my friends and when I asked my prof via email he just laughed at me and asked me ""Do you really not know what the difference is?"" to which I am too humiliated to admit that I don't.

my question is a two-parter:

When a school releases their match day results, if you are doing the ""start in gen surg then transition to plastics"" pathway, is your match result listed as ""General Surgery"" or as ""Plastic Surgery""?

When you get in to one of these ""start in gen surg --&gt; plastics"" programs, is your transition to plastics guaranteed? or are you competing with others in your program for those spots in plastics and the rest are out of luck?

4) I know they vary from state to state but does anyone know of a ballpark figure for premiums by specialty? Ideally, it would be contrasted to net pay. 

5) The resident malpractice insurance is covered by the hospital, correct? Is this similar to an attending working at a hospital? (See #3)

Now I'm hearing stories about the in-hospital rotations with crazy hours (IM, OB/GYN, surgery).

So far, my plan is as follows:

* Pathoma, filling in First Aid as I go
* UWorld, filling in First Aid as I go
* Firecracker, filling in First Aid as I go
* DIT, probably during weeks 4, 5, 6 (giving me the last week or two for a second pass through UWorld and general review of FA)

I'd love some advice on how to pace/schedule myself. My self-discipline is not very good, and I have a lot of responsibilities at home, so I think what I need is a reasonable, manageable schedule that I can work through each day, ideally finishing by early afternoon. (I'm usually at my desk ready to work by 7:30am.) What I'm thinking right now is about 2 hours of Pathoma daily + 46 UW questions, going through UW one section at a time to ensure I see every question. Then in free/extra time I'll work on Firecracker.

*Edit for clarification: When I said I go through 46/day, I mean in gross detail: I read the explanations, all the incorrect answers, and the summary, and I write details from that into FA. Sometimes I even draw diagrams.*

Probably worth mentioning that I did most of Pathoma during the past school year, but my retention of it is not very good. Currently on Chapter 6, and I've completed these sections in UW: Anatomy, Behavioral Science, Embryology, Genetics, Histology, Immunology, and a smattering of other sections (around 450-500 questions).

My question is, what are my chances?

I just started studying for the Step 1 with plans to take it in June/July. I have the newest 2013 copy of First Aid in a 3 inch binder. I'm trying to stick to key resources because I find anymore can become a distraction (E.g. First Aid, UWorld, Rapid Review, Kaplan Qbank, etc.).

I'm particularly confused about Pathology. During the school year, I used Rapid Review from Goljan and watched Pathoma videos. I found Rapid Review to be more useful for the school exams, but Pathoma to be an absolutely vital learning tool for understanding the material. I also would occasionally listen to Goljan audio if I had the time, but mostly avoided it since I enjoyed Pathoma more.

Now that I'm sitting down to study for the Step, I'm at a crossroad where I'm not sure how to attack Pathology. I have not yet purchased UWorld. I am currently subscribed to Kaplan Qbank and was hoping to get at least 60-70% of it done before moving onto dedicated UWorld. Still not sure if this is wise or not.

Having already gone through Pathoma and marked up my Rapid Review book and made it an excellent Path resource - I'm now listening to Goljan audio with First Aid open and Rapid Review open next to it - and I find myself drawn to annotating First Aid with Goljan's lectures. The key points from each Pathology are already in First Aid, but he mentions additional details or points. Obviously, I'm not going to copy RR into First Aid word for word, but I mean First Aid does leave out some details from RR. For example, when discussing Aortic Aneurysms, it's mentioned in RR in the small blue wording the clinical manifestations, while this isn't mentioned at all in First Aid. 

Basically, I'm confused about how much to actually annotate. I keep hearing/reading that ""First Aid is enough! It has everything that's necessary to know for the exam!"" So, I'm concerned that if I start annotating, I'll just make the book a bloated resource with extraneous info not necessary for the exam. On the other hand, I see First Aid as just a resource with just enough points with no tying them together so I feel it necessary to annotate and explain.

Or should I just say, ""Fuck it"" and stick to Rapid Review for pathology since that's been my go-to book for Pathology for the past few months? Argh, so confused.

**UPDATE:**

Student FAQs - ACGME Unified Accreditation

Posted Nov. 9, 2012
**Many programs still do not know what to make of the unified accreditation system. How will the AOA and ACGME educate the residency and fellowship directors about this new system and how it will impact their programs?**
There will be many stakeholders in the entire process, including the programs themselves. Throughout this process, the AOA, ACGME and AACOM have been very communicative with each other and involved stakeholders. All organizations plan to continue this process to ensure all are receiving timely information as it becomes available.

**When will MD students be able to apply to DO residencies? Will this take place in 2015 or later?**
We anticipate the unified accreditation process will take place in July 2015. At that time, all students will be eligible to apply to all programs.

**Who will issue board certifications? The AOA or the ABMS?**
As it stands, this unified accreditation process will not affect board certification, therefore both certifications will be available to DOs. 

**Will those already training in ACGME accredited programs at the time of the merger, or July 2015, be granted AOA approved residency status?**
We anticipate yes.

**How will the AOA accredited programs address the training of MD interns/residents?**
It will be a matter of time and discussion to see how allopathic residents can meet osteopathic principles and practice competencies. 

**Does this mean that trainees entering residency in 2013 and 2014 will be graduating from a ""unified accreditation"" program?**
Yes, residents starting their residency program in 2013 and beyond will complete a training program under the unified system.

**What does the implementation of this new unified system mean for osteopathic specialty colleges?**
Osteopathic specialty colleges will always provide valuable services, including education, communications, professional networking and advocacy.  When the unified system goes into effect, we anticipate the specialty colleges will play a role in the development of educational standards and milestones for osteopathic-focused residency programs, including representation on the residency review committees.

**What will happen to AOA residency programs that are unable to meet ACGME requirements?**
When the unified system goes into effect, all AOA accredited programs will be automatically  accredited by ACGME and will fall into compliance. Both the AOA and the ACGME believe that the vast majority of programs will meet the requirements on the first attempt and those that don't would have a minimum of three more years after implementation to ensure their compliance.

Both the AOA and ACGME understand  the need for more GME positions.  The decision to enter into an agreement to pursue a unified accreditation system was not entered to weed out poor programs, but rather to preserve and expand programs and training opportunities. The standards that are created will be designed to demonstrate quality and best practices.   

**Although there are many details still to be determined, can you anticipate how the Match process will work? Certain osteopathic residency programs require rotations prior to applying - will this be waived for MD students since they won't be dual accredited by then?**
With the new system, we anticipate that there would be one match instead of two. It is still a bit too early to try to answer the second question in detail.   There will be committees and task forces formed that will work on this and other issues.  

**As we move toward a unified accreditation system, will we move toward a unified board system in the future?**
As things stand, the unified accreditation system is strictly limited to graduate medical education and does not include board certification or medical school accreditation. However, the AOA believes it is important to the public for osteopathic physicians to demonstrate their competency in osteopathic principles as part of the osteopathic board certification process. 

**Is there potential for this agreement to fall apart?**
We are extremely optimistic about this process moving forward. The agreement we are working on, as with most agreements, will allow any party to opt out of if there are insurmountable barriers. 

**How will the COMLEX exam play into the application process for GME? Will the osteopathic focused programs still require the COMLEX score?**
COMLEX-USA will continue to be the required examination series and the pathway to licensure for osteopathic physicians. It is widely recognized and universally accepted as the valid examination for osteopathic physician competency assessment for licensure. It is also required by accreditation standards established by the Commission on Osteopathic College Accreditation (COCA), and is a requirement for graduation from all colleges of osteopathic medicine. COMLEX-USA is regarded by the majority of residency program directors of AOA and ACGME accredited residency programs as an important and useful assessment tool as part of the evaluation of DO residency applicants for their programs. In addition, the National Board of Osteopathic Medical Examiners has developed tools for residency program directors to correlate COMLEX scores with the USMLE.

**What, if anything, will happen to uniquely DO specialties like NMM, proctology, etc? Should students be hesitant to enter such specialties?**
This will be addressed in AOA discussions with ACGME, but within the ACGME system, there will be osteopathic-focused residency programs that will include specialties unique to DOs.  In fact, we have had discussions with ACGME about developing a Residency Review Committee for NMM, specifically, since none currently exists for that specialty area.

**Does this mean that MD students can now learn OMM?**
MDs were never prohibited from learning OMM.  Many of our schools offer CME in osteopathic manipulative medicine, and MDs have always been welcome to attend those courses.

**When new programs do open, how will we know if OMM prerequisites are required?**
This issue is under discussion.  We do not yet know the details of how each program and its details will be presented, but when we do, this information will be made available.

I took a vacation to do some soul searching, and I figured out I had to work in an ever-evolving industry that also involved helping people.

Can anyone help or point me to a good in-depth resource?,13,3,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/1hmkog/interpreting_blood_gases_can_anyone_help_or_point/,"Hi, I'm not a med student but a respiratory physiology student. I'm doing a module on blood gases but one of the examples I have to interpret is confusing the hell out of me and our 'official' handbook is proving pretty useless.

Can anyone point me to a good, detailed blood-gas analysis resource? I've googled about but a lot of what I've found is focused on metabolic states, whereas I need to focus on respiratory disorders.

For interest, the blood gas example I've been given is:

**Type 2 Resp Failure**

* pH		7.430		[7.35 - 7.45]

* PCO2		6.58		[4.67 - 6.00]	kPa

* HCO3- 	29.5		[23 - 27] 	mmol/L

* PO2		7.02		[10.67 - 13.33]	kPa

* SO2		86.6		[90 - 100]	%

My own interpretation of this is as follows
&gt;The pH is within normal range, though to the alkalotic end of the scale.
The PCO2 is high, indicating acidosis.
The HCO3- is high, indicating alkalosis.
The pH and HCO3- are both indicating alkalosis, so there is a slight metabolic alkalosis.
The PCO2 is acidotic, compensating the metabolic alkalosis, leading to an overal normal pH.
The PO2 and SO2 are both significantly low, so there is hypoxaemia. 
Overall, there is hypoxaemia with compensated metabolic alkalosis.
This patient has Type 2 Respiratory Failure indicated by low oxygen and high CO2.

However, Type 2 Respiratory Failure is usually characterised by respiratory acidosis, not metabolic alkalosis (its exact opposite!). I just don't know where I'm going wrong.

I get in at 4:30 AM and see 2 patients.  I'm allowed to pick them at random, it doesn't really matter as they don't care about my note and during rounds I rarely even present these patients.  

Anyway, during rounds our job as the students is to grab the patient's charts and flip them to the physician order sheets so the interns can write down orders as we round.  During all this running around grabbing charts we are not able to listen to the conversation about each patient, and they don't want us to enter the rooms because it slows us down in getting the charts for them.  If we try to ask questions they brush us off.  Sometimes they just say it's a stupid question and walk away.  Today they said my patient had a hernia that I didn't notice, I asked if they could point it out to me and show me what it felt like, as I've never felt a hernia before.  They said ""we don't have the time to slow down and teach you guys these things.""

After that the first case in the OR shows up and one of us (there are 4 of us total) scrubs into it.  The rest of us have tried to then do attending rounds but the residents seem very against us going with them.  They just send us up to the OR, even though we can't scrub into any of the cases up there.

It's been a week and I've learned nothing at all and I have no idea who to complain to.  I feel like complaining to the residents will only make things worse, and complaining to the attendings (including the program coordinator) won't change anything about the residents, and once word trickles down to them they will just make it worse anyway.

I can't imagine I'm the first to have a horrible situation like this so what have others done before to fix it?",,False,,t5_2re2p,False,,,True,t3_zobv1,http://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/zobv1/awful_surgery_rotation_what_do_i_do/,
