1332794111.0,80,self.askseddit,req2c,"If you have a question that is something along the lines of ""How do I game my friend?"" then read this.",91,11,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/askseddit/comments/req2c/if_you_have_a_question_that_is_something_along/,"There are a lot of people coming into AskSeddit lately with questions very much like this:

* How do I get out of the friend zone?
* Is there a way I can get my friend to become a FWB?
* How do I escalate with a friend of mine?

Et cetera.

Here comes the bad part: Don't even try. Just don't. It's a bad idea and you will almost definitely end up hurting yourself or her in the process.

Here's the thing: This whole concept of ""I want to change her mind about me""? That isn't how pickup works. You need to understand one of the basic tenets of seduction, and that is that **no matter how much you learn about seduction, you cannot make any one person more interested if she isn't already.**

What you're dealing with in these situations is a simple case of [oneitis](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/pbkxs/glossary_of_terms_hz/), which basically translates to ""I want to be with this girl because she's special/she's the one/there's something about her/etc."" The generally accepted prescription for oneitis is to ""go out and have sex with ten other women and then see if you feel that this one girl is still that special."" And the basic reason behind it is this:

People are lazy. As a pickup artist, you do not want to have to work too hard at this. You want to be able to get the maximum result for the least amount of effort. And the fact of the matter is, in **ninety-nine percent of the cases**, if you're trying to get with a girl who already knows you and considers you a friend, the amount of effort to get her to think of you first as a sexual object and then as one she's actually interested in being with is FAR too much.

You know what you should be doing instead? **Go out and find NEW girls.** Forget about the ones you're already friends with. It's way more trouble than it's worth, and you will not only be spinning your wheels, you'll get frustrated over something that's supposed to be fun.

I know that AskSeddit is a place for newbies, and that's fine. But the thing is, you can't expect to come in without having read up on anything at all and expect us to give you a magic pill that will get you the girl you want. We can't do that, and it would be unfair to you if we didn't tell you that up front.

My general advice for newbies?

1. Go to [/r/seduction](/r/seduction) and read as much of the content in the sidebar as you can. Learn the basics, especially the parts about inner game. Seduction is as much if not more about helping yourself to be a better person than it is about getting girls.
2. Forget about the women that are already in your life. And I mean *forget* about them. The odds are overwhelmingly that you will never sleep with them if you haven't by now. If you're keeping them around because you're in the friend zone and you hope that someday they'll let you out of it, set them loose, because you're being disingenuous and perhaps even downright dishonest to them by being their friend when it's not what you want to be.
3. Go out and meet as many new women as you can. I know there are a lot of younger guys in this subreddit, people who are in college and the like. There couldn't be a *better* time in your life to simply go out and meet as many women as you possibly can. They're all OVER the place where you are.
4. Be excited. If you're just starting out with PUA material, get psyched! You have an awesome journey ahead of you and you will learn a lot of interesting things about yourself if you treat it seriously.",,False,,t5_2s7xh,False,,,True,t3_req2c,http://www.reddit.com/r/askseddit/comments/req2c/if_you_have_a_question_that_is_something_along/,

The answer in the first case could be: ""Wow, my mind just went totally blank. You need to say something now or this will get awkward fast."" In the second case, it could be ""I wanted to say hi to you before I got too nervous to talk to you at all, but that's as far as I planned ahead. Shit.""

I called this ""embrace the truth"", which I really mean, but I realize there's a larger point that is maybe swept under the rug by a lot of intermediate guys but accepted as gospel by the truly advanced guys.

Embarrassment, shame, fear, self-consciousness... these are INTRINSIC HUMAN EMOTIONS. If you do not have them, you are a sociopath. If someone tells you they don't have them, they are almost certainly a liar, and if not, they are almost certainly a sociopath themselves.

You've heard it in all the war movies, when an older officer is inspiring a private. ""We're all scared,"" he might say, ""bravery is about what you do when you're scared, not when you don't have any fear.""

The difference between a man who can successfully ""not give a fuck"" and one who lives in fear of approaching women is that the latter guy isn't just embarrassed or afraid... he is embarrassed and afraid to be embarrassed and afraid. ""Not giving a fuck"" is about recognizing and accepting how ridiculous you are; that you're this goofy creature who does stupid things.

Those asshole PUAs with their greasy slicked back hair, lava lamps, and water beds? The ones relishing in getting any woman at any point? Those guys are pretending they're not feeling what you're feeling because they're just as terrified as you are to feel embarrassed, but they've learned to hide it.

Those great guys who everybody likes, treat people well, and have women flock to them? The so called ""naturals""? They get just as embarrassed but they don't freak out about it. What make them ""natural"" is that they act natural... and being a little afraid to be rejected by a girl, or running out of things to say, or stammering and being a goof is a perfectly natural thing to happen.

Being ""alpha"" is about accepting this kind of stuff happens, and you're just a human being like everyone else. If you really think any of these mythical heros of yours are perfect - Clooney or Pitt or whoever you consider the ladies man of choice to be - you've let yourself be convinced of something that isn't true by imperfect information. Everyone has a vested interest in presenting themselves a certain way, and your own head is the only head you actually get to exist inside. But I promise you, everyone else walking around - ladies man or lady - is just as much a bizarrely evolved super-ape as you are. In their heads, the same shit is going on to a lesser or greater extent.

In order to successfully ""not give a fuck"", you need to stop being so hard on yourself. You knew that already. But what that means is to stop being embarrassed to be embarrassed. Just let yourself be self-deprecating or silly, and don't worry if other people see that you aren't perfect. If they judge you for it, that makes them the fool, not you.

2. Small-Talk, build attraction, do some low level kino (Hand shaking, Arm brushing, Light touching on her arm to emphasize your points, Anchoring her arm near elbow to hold her close as you talk, Standing next to her with your arm touching hers, High Fives, Standing very close with your legs touching hers, Sitting close together with your legs touching hers, Lightly and incidentally brushing her abdomen with your hands
while talking, Briefly touching her back with your palm while speaking as if you are
pulling her in to hear you better, Brushing (or pretending to brush) something off of her face (this one's dumb and obvious IMO), Talking very closely with your face touching hers because the environment
is extremely loud, Touching an interesting necklace she's wearing, meanwhile allowing
your fingers to lightly caress her neck, Playfully pinching her cheeks)
3. Go do something together now, or set up a date. ([D-Close](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/s17s0/dont_close_dclose_and_stop_flakes_cold/)) Examples: Bowling, Pool, Driving Range, Mini Golf, Climbing, Ice Skating, Go Carting, Walking, Hiking, Going To The Beach, Cycle Ride, Fun Fair, Theme Park, Zoo, Aquarium, Arcade, Dancing Lesson, Art Lesson, Cooking Lesson, Wine Tasting, Pottery Class, Local Gig, Comedy Show, Shopping, Volunteering.

Please correct me if I'm wrong.

The title sums it up, I've been with my girlfriend for 8 months now and she recently confessed that she loved when I'm seducing her. The problem is, I fucking don't know when I'm doing it!

When we first dated, she was the one that made the first step. I was giving more of a ""don't give a fuck"" attitude and she had a bad, bad crush on me. In a nutshell, I didn't do much of seducing there and things were easy as pie.

I know I could ask her but I thought it would look more alpha to simply start to be seductive again without asking her exactly what I need to do.

I'm kind of lost, not knowing how to proceed. It's my first girlfriend and I'm more of an AFC than a true PUA, even if I try to dress well, groom, act confident and be interesting. It's almost like this relationship weakened my abilities.

4.  Women love to talk about two things above all others:  Relationships and the unknown.


5.  If a girl opens you, she perceives the value as even.


6.  Demonstrate preselection by other women, that you are a leader of men, the protector of loved ones, a willingness to walk away, proper emotes, and that you are a successful risk-taker, and you embody what she subconsciously desires.

16.  BS babbles brains.


17.  Assume Attraction, and Escalate.


18.  Kino, Kino, Kino.


You –


My body language is slow and deliberate.  I move less than anyone else around me.  I always lean back and take up space.  I mimic her motions, voice and posture.  I do not react.  Mt attitude is positive and I do not seek anyone’s approval.  I smile, playful and flirty.
I could care less.  I throw comments and go, regardless of the outcome.  I don’t wait for a response.  I project fun, excitement and energy.  I’m funny.  I make decisions quickly, and I do not care what the woman thinks.  Everything is no big deal.  My voice is deep, loud and slow.  I redirect questions onto her for details, and I do not interrupt her answers.  I remain silent until I get the answer I want.  I count to three, touch her and speak.  I make eye contact, smile and use her name constantly.  I never multitask.  I screen her with statement questions, and never use more than three in a row.  I force her investment of money, time and thought.  I am the observed, not the observer.  I am comfortable, relaxed and have fun.  I never hold my drink in front of me.  I am enthusiastic about what I talk about, but not about talking to her.  I use takeaways to create an emotional vacuum.  I compliment her uniqueness as a person, not as a woman.  I let conversations I have no interest in fall away, by smiling and changing topics.  When she touches me, I tell her it’s not for free, and to slow down.  When she misbehaves, I ask for her hand, slap it, and toss it away.  I use open loops to create suspense.  (There’s three things I like about you….but never use the third.)
“Pleasure meeting you”, is my all-purpose eject.  I never use situational openers or comment on the obvious.  (You’re tall.)


Her –


If she tests you, it’s because she’s interested in seeing who you are.  Her proximity, laugh and smile and touch all indicate her interest, while I playfully push her away.  Her shields exist because sympathy and generosity turn to neutrality, then hostility.

The friend that I came to visit was showing us around his town and he has one of his lady friends join us for the eve.  She was a very attractive young lady if I say so myself.  She was also pretty cool and down to earth, so we all hit it off.  


We end up going bowling and I'm teasing her a bit and I end up saying something about making war with her.  She turns to me and says that ""maybe we should just make love instead"" and then just gives me a flirty look.  It kinda caught me off guard I guess?  I forgot what I ended up saying after that.  Prolly some wack shit.


Then later in the night, we're riding in the back of my friend's car with all the windows down and her hair was kinda whipping in my face so I tell her I'm gonna pull her hair jokingly.  Then she says ""I just might like it"".  Again, this kinda caught me off guard and I didn't have the best comeback.  I forgot what I said, but it wasn't too flirty.  And I also noticed that whenever a song lyric about sex came up, she'd kinda look in my direction.  I don't think she noticed that I noticed.

I met a European chick about two years ago now when I was living in the UK. Only saw her for one night, went OK, but when she returned home to her country she was messaging me nonstop.

This girl was very stereotypical, hollywood-style hot. Honestly not my sexual preference, but my ego said ""wow, a girl like this is this interested in me? i should be chatting with her."" Mistake #1.

I end up talking to her on facebook off and on up until now (about a year and a half). She ends up traveling America, starts messaging me a lot and wants me to come meet her when she goes to NYC. NYC is only a few hours away and I've got a bunch of friends there, so I'm thinking cool, maybe I can hook up with her, but if not I should get a nice ego boost regardless and have some good nights out in the city.

End up meeting this past Saturday night with my friend and her gay travel partner. We all chat for a while and then head to a bar. As soon as we get to the bar, my buddy starts hitting on her, kinoing hard, etc. He asks before he does it if I'm cool with it, and I'm like nah dude that's not cool. He continues regardless and she starts becoming receptive to it. They make out. She starts sitting on his lap. At this point I'm thinking haha how is this happening, fuck this, and just start looking occupied to kill the awkwardness. I had a 2nd friend arriving so I just kept texting and chatting to him on the phone.

I stopped talking to them completely as it became very awkward and I felt like both of them were doing me wrong. When my other buddy arrived to the bar, we left and had a good night elsewhere.

My reaction to their actions so far has just been to completely ignore them. I feel like my guy friend who did it was just a complete douchebag and despite trying to apologize to me many times I know he'd not hesitate to do it again in a month with another girl if given the opportunity so I can't 'forgive' him for it. Regarding the chick, I'd think that even if she truly liked and clicked with my buddy, she wouldn't do anything with him in front of me out of respect...considering she'd known me for ages and him for one night. Just seems like a low-quality thing to do that can't be respected.

What ticks me off a bit is how I've heard the douchebag friend has handled the situation with me to her. Apparently he has been framing it to make it seem like I was in love with her, had a huge crush on her, blah blah. So she now thinks I'm some heartbroken emo queer who is super pissed off. I thought not talking to them again would be the easiest way to just not worry about it anymore while maintaining my self respect, but it makes me cringe to know that she now thinks I was in love with her.

Internalizing the things I am about to mention has led me to have some pretty awesome convos with people. Any critique is welcome.

I’m assuming the conversation is between TWO people. With that assumption its important to realize that IT IS BETWEEN TWO PEOPLE, so if the other person isn’t really contributing to the conversation, then its going to be a shitty convo no matter what you do.

Alright, lets assume your talking to someone smarter than a donut. How do you start the conversation? WTF DO I SAY? Well you should remember that the point of a conversation its to convey and share ideas. Therefore, you should either ask a direct question such as “You look lost, are you looking for something?” or an indirect question which is actually a statement “That is a mighty fine tramp stamp you have there my lady” meant to have them go off about their “so they don’t forget my name when I’m getting banged” tattoo idea.

The best way to continue a conversation is to actually pay attention to them when they speak. Lets assume she starts talking about her backpacking trip, there are a multitude of questions and directions you can take her. For example, how was the weather when she was there? Where there any dangerous parts of the trail that scared her? Any awesome memorable sights? Any lions, tigers or bears? Ever get an urge to punt a bunny? Things like that. Basically if someone is speaking about something, you want to try to replicate the experience in your own mind, and the best way for the experiences to sync up is to ask them questions. 

When you ask them questions you seem interested in them. They feel important and happy when someone views them as interesting. We all want to be found interesting; we all want to capture the hearts and minds of people around us. Give them that feeling and they will love you forever.

What, where, when, who, why. Use them like a cheap personal whore – often. Remember some important things: Men like to explain and teach, men basically want the world to think their way. Women like to empathize and talk about emotions, women basically want the world to feel their way. Golden rule for when talking to a female; give that bitch some emotions, bitches love emotions.

Remember how I said its between TWO people? Yeah that’s where you come in. You have to reciprocate the conversation in someway. It seriously helps if you have done interesting things. If you haven’t, START FUCKING DOING THEM. Our lives for the most part are boring stretches of abyss spotted with exciting and interesting experiences. It should be one of your personal SERIOUS goals to spot the shit out of the abyss.

If she mentions her backpacking trip, you can talk about your backpacking trip, or how you read trail magazines because you want to do it one day.  If she talks about her job, ask her what she wanted to do when she was little, or why she chose this instead. If she talks about shoes, change the fucking subject. 

The best way to get a person to open up, is to make them believe you are interested in them.

Other people seem to get really good advice here so I thought I'd try my luck as well as let people know the whole ""number on the bill"" thing works!

**background**

There's an asian restaurant in NYC that I frequent where a really cute waitress works (I am also asian btw). Last summer (2012) I went with a friend and while we were eating lunch she and I kept making eye contact. I kept ordering pineapple juice for some reason. Anyway, I ended up leaving my number and a note saying, ""Hey I think you're really cute. Here's my number (xxx)xxx-xxxx - Let's get coffee sometime! :)""

It was on a total whim: months passed and I assumed she thought I was weird or too forward so I let it go. To my complete and utter surprise, she texts me last night, opening with ""Hey, pineapple juice""!! It took me a while to figure out who was texting me, but she said that she thought she'd lost the napkin with my number on it and just found it again. She told me all her co-workers at the restaurant also read it (-_-) and I figured I had nothing to lose so I asked her to get drinks next weekend. She responded ""u r cute"" and now we've agreed to meet next sunday when she doesn't have work!

**3 Questions:**

* Do I take her to coffee on sunday like I said in my note or drinks?
* She seems to be a foreigner who can speaks english well enough, but has trouble with the grammatical nuances (for example: ""I only free on Sunday"" instead of ""I'm only free on Sunday""). Has anyone ever had experience with foreign girls traveling in your home country?
* I've NEVER approached girls in this manner before - I'm graduating from college this spring and until now have only approached girls I knew from university. I'd appreciate tips on how to handle the situation I've set myself up for.

Thanks for reading!

**TL;DR: Waitress I left my number for thinks I'm cute and wants to meet. I would like tips and advice on how to proceed from here.**

I realize this is not the attitude I should have. But I don't really know how to get rid of it. I've basically set this up as a main life goal for the moment, which is bad not only because it screws my chances with women, but also because I really should be focusing more on my career goals right now.

The sum of this of course means that I reek of desperation when trying to get with women, which they sense almost instantly, and then self fulfilling prophecies.

On one hand, when reading FR's, I'll see people go in with the typical type of openers you'll see in the Mystery Method, like ""did you see the fight outside,"" etc.  And those same people swear that you can't go up to a girl and just say ""Hey, I'm so-and-so, what's your story?"" because it expresses interest up front, and that might shut her down.  

On the other, people seem to suggest that going up without an opener and just introducing yourself, or being direct and saying ""Hey, I couldn't help but notice you're very cute, I'm blah-blah."" And I've seen girls on here confirm that having someone immediatly flatter them like that piques their interest and shows confidence.  

Personally, I hate canned openers, I have a harder time transitioning from something that feels less natural, into a natural conversation.  But I wanted to poll the crowd and see if it just comes down to situation, or what.

I hope I'm not the only one around here who thinks these people need to stop it and find a single girl to crush on.

Reasons to not go for a girl with a boyfriend:

1. She has a boyfriend, your mother raised you better than that
2. If she does get with you, are you going to be able to trust her? People don't change, there's a large chance she will cheat on you. You don't want a girl like that.
3. Higher chance of losing her as a friend, if you make a move on her and she knows you know she has a boyfriend, she's not going to think very highly of you anymore.
4. You're guna get your ass kicked

EDIT:
5. Make her a friend. If she's hot, she will have hot friends who are likely single.

Also, the point of this post has been missed. If you're just out looking to fuck, that's your decision. I personally won't sleep with a girl if she has a boyfriend.

Simply put, you meet them out. Obvious choices are at a bar, or a club, maybe a coffee shop, bookstore (they do still exist), at a baseball game, at an organized event, on the street just go and say, ""Finally some good weather! I've been dying to do _______ waiting for the rain to stop.""  

You can meet people while you are ordering breakfast/lunch/dinner at the deli, this just happened to me last night.  I met someone while ordering a sandwich and casually talking about how it's been so nice out and it eventually developed into an entire conversation. Turns out she is an Ophthalmologist and she offered me a free eye exam to check up on my Lasic surgery I had a few months ago. 

You can meet people on the bus, waiting for the bus, waiting for the subway, at a concert, in the park, at the gym, *in your car with the windows down at a stoplight!* The point is, **you have to meet them, and introduce them to you.** And you can't really do that sitting in your room on the computer.  However if you have a laptop/tablet/smartphone, go to a coffee shop, browse reddit and talk to someone. Anyone.  You meet people by meeting people. 

Under 21?  Then most likely you are still in school.  Join clubs, expand your social circle and get with new groups.  Be the organizer, start a new club get a bunch of people to play a sport, have them bring their friends, call a house party.  Make it so eventually you are the one people are looking to to have fun.  Go to an arcade, go karts pick up an instrument, already play? Start a band! (Every band needs a bass/drummer, they are often hard to come by).  Does your school have a ""Home movies"" type club? Maybe maybe not, but that can be fun, create awesome memories, and get you to meet interesting people you never thought you would. 

Go to a cooking class, a beer/wine/cheese tasting.  You know Groupon? USE THAT SHIT! Go alone if you *have* to, try to bring a friend, you'll most likely feel more relaxed and can psych each other up.  Point is, you just have to do things you a) Enjoy b) maybe a little out of your comfort zone.

When I got divorced I thought age would bring new wisdom in the dating arena, but alas, I seem to be only somewhat less clueless than I used to be. I expect if I were a kid today, I'd be diagnosed with high functioning Asperberger's. I did a little dating when I first got divorced, but it was more like I fell into it, literally ""got lucky"", rather than actually being able to control my own destiny.

So last night I was out with a meetup group at a bar, and met a younger woman in her late 20s and feel like she was interested in me. She touched my arm often while speaking, made lots of eye contact, and we spoke for quite a while with no signs of flagging interest.

A couple of her girlfriends came by some time before the meetup was over, and I enjoyed their company as well, but when the whole thing broke up I wasn't sure what to do, so I just said something about seeing her again at the next meetup in a couple of weeks and left. Later I thought man, I could have at least asked for her phone number, jeez! I guess that would have not been inappropriate, right? Or is it okay to just wait until the next meetup and see if she's still interested? I guess my question is, what should I expect that she would have been expecting me to do?

Here's another one - this evening I went to get a haircut at the local ""hip"" barbershop. As I walked over to sit in the waiting area, I noticed this one good looking stylist, probably late 20s, early 30s, who was just finishing up on another guy's hair, and naturally was hoping I'd get her for mine. Didn't happen, and I was assigned another stylist to get my hair cut. At that point in the cut where the stylist spins you around to look at the back of your head, the other stylist was looking at me from across the room and flashed me a smile, which I reciprocated.

At this barbershop, after the cut is finished the stylist gives you a shoulder rub down with one of those vibrator things that fits on the back of your hand, and you get turned around at that time too. So I'm getting my massage, feeling all relaxed and I look up, and the other stylist is sitting in her chair looking at me again, big smile this time. 

Obviously, this seems like a clear sign of some kind of interest, but the question is, what to do about that? Should I have suavely approached her and asked for her number? I mean, is that cool in someone's place of work? Of course, if all this is happening in her place of work, I guess that's really the only place where something like asking for her number could happen. But again I ask, what should I expect that she would have been expecting me to do?

At my age there's always the thought that someone that young may merely think I'm a cute older man who reminds her of her father, or grandfather. But I'm tired of making excuses for myself, I've done that all my life, time to stop.

Growth is good, and newcomers are good, but it does make it difficult for more experienced sedditors to get what we want out of seddit. We want to read IRL field reports we can learn from, not answer questions from newbies all day. 

So, this subreddit, AskSeddit, is meant to be a place where it's **OK to ask questions,** even totally newb ones. If you have questions like...

&gt;This hot babe just texted me ""blah blah blah,"" how do I respond?

&gt;I'm stuck in the friendzone, how do I get Sarah to like me?

&gt;I've got a first date tomorrow, how do I get in her pants?

...**DON'T** ask them in r/seduction (or people will get upset at you), but **DO** ask them here. Hopefully you'll get some good feedback both from your peers and more experienced people.

It bears emphasizing that those of us with short fuses about newbies on seddit don't actually hate newbies – we just hate not being able to find the kind of well-read, FR-based content we want on seddit. If questions like the above migrated from seddit to here, we'd all be happier, and probably more willing to give constructive feedback. It's a win-win.

So, ask away!

---

(All that said, it's still a good idea for your growth as a PUA to not get so hung up on specific girls or specific situations like the above. Some very core concepts in seduction are having an ""abundance mentality"" and not getting ""oneitis"" over specific girls. If you don't know what to do in a particular situation, generally you should just be bold – do something that feels confident and fun, and see what happens... and then write an FR about it.)",,False,,t5_2s7xh,True,,,True,t3_fj55r,http://www.reddit.com/r/askseddit/comments/fj55r/welcome_to_askseddit/,moderator

I didn't get into my first relationship until 2 years ago, and it was with a beautiful woman. We dated for a little over a year, but I ended up breaking it off with her. Guys would be so jealous of me when we would walk down the street but she was extremely emotionally abusive toward me (You'll never do better than me, you're lucky I'm dating you). She had absolutely no respect for me and although I never caught her, I am certain she was cheating on me (during the last 5 months we would have sex maybe once a month).

After I broke it off (because of an ultimatum she gave that I either move in or break up), she constantly called me wanting to meet up. Suddenly she wanted to have sex with me all the time, but I could tell it was just a ploy for me to get back together with her. Still, I would meet up and have sex with her simply because I had no other prospects (""I'm just a sucka with no self esteem...""). I was upfront with her about this, and that this was just about sex and that I didn't want to get back together with her. Still, it was not worth it. I always ended up feeling like shit (even though I was upfront about it).

Anyway, I recently decided to stop talking to her and figured the only way to get past this was to get out there and talk to people. I quickly realized something about myself: I have no identity anymore. Over the course of our relationship, all of my friends ended up getting married and buying houses and having babies. Nobody is around to go out anymore. I don't even know where to begin if I want to start meeting new people.

My first thought was to think of my hobbies and what I enjoy, but I can't even come up with anything.

I like boxing, I work out sometimes, I watch Breaking Bad and Curb. I like to fish. Other than that, I don't do anything. I work, I come home, I spend time in front of the PC, go to bed, then do it over until Friday, where I get the ""I'm going to bed"" response to my text asking to go out with any of my friends at 9:30PM. Same thing saturday. Sunday I try to see my family. That's it.

I feel like if I don't change something, I'm going to wake up and be 60 and hate myself. I know I need to find out who I am, but how?

It's actually someone I initially approached (had a shot in my hand, asked to take it w his group, flirted from then on).  It was during a pub crawl, and after an hour or so of sporadically flirting, we walked into the next bar together, and he asked if I was getting a drink.  I said I had no cash left, and he responded, ""so you want ME to buy you a drink?""
I said sure, and he just looked at me and said, ""beg me.""  I laughed and jokingly said something along the lines of ""pretty please get me a beer?"", and he grabbed me by the arm and pulled me in close and said in a low voice, ""no. I want you to come here, and whisper into my ear, and say, 'please, [his name], will you please buy me a beer?"".

Problem is we've got comfortable, and when I ask her things about what I can do to make things more interesting or spicy, we both come up with no ideas.

So fuck it, I'm going to seduce her again. Sure we have sex still, but there's no seduction involved. Here's some info:

I've never cooked for her because I'm a terrible cook and hate doing it. But it's not out of the question

She works two jobs and just graduated university so we actually have time together again, and I want to do that.

She is turned on by fashion. If I wear sharp clothes or a suit she goes nuts. I let her paint my nails once and she was instantly turned on by being able to do a design on there.

We have lived together for 11 months

She loves driving out into the country for no reason and I hate it.

Anyway, feel free to ask questions to help me formulate a plan to blow her panties off and reignite the spark between us. Thanks!

During this time, Jessica became more and more attractive, and really started to put herself out there, getting a lot of attention. Meanwhile, Jessica and I remained really close friends.  

I have recently graduated college, and was finally able to escape home and end the tornado of a relationship that was my dating Amanda. It got ugly, and Im finally starting to get over it. I am away from Amanda, and I am working on becoming my old confident self, the person I was before Amanda broke me down.

I am currently visiting with a girl who is a friend to both me and Jessica, and therefore I have been seeing a lot of Jessica. 

I can't get Jessica out of my mind. I'm recognizing everything from the oneitis to overthinking the smallest actions. I know what it is, and I know what I should do, but I'm having some trouble. I guess I just wanted to write this somewhere in hopes that I'd be able to get it off my chest, and maybe get some moral support from you guys.

I am not too interested in this girl, but I am working on expanding my social circle. She brought along 2 cute friends, and I noticed one of them checking me out early on in the night. We will call her E. The party was right next door, so we didn't have far to walk. I also strategically left a few drinks back at the pregame house.


We take a few shots, joke around, then head out to the party. Once we get there, I lead all 3 girls out to the dance floor, and start dancing with them. I escalate a little kino with M, but was joking around with them all. I motioned to E that she should hop on the counter and start dancing, and she says yea, grabs my hand and moves me over to the counter with her. I flirt with her a bit, then help her up. I go back to the other 2 girls, and soon they are up on the counter. 

At one point, E started running her hands through my hair and bending over to put her arm around my chest. At this point, I fully knew she was interested. I turned to her, told her I needed someone to dance with and helped her down.

We start dancing together, in full sight of M and her friend. I make it obvious that I want to kiss E, but she tells me she has a bf. Rather than freaking out, I'm having fun dancing with her, so I keep to it. After a while, she turns around and tells me:
""So my bf is in a frat and I know he cheats on me all the time. We have a sort of open relationship, and I want to hook up with you, but I can't in front of my friends.""

I tell her I have a few beers next door, and we should go get them, so her and I leave. We get to the house and go upstairs into a random room. We start talking, I'm joking with her, and I thought it was going well. She thought it was my room but I told her the truth. A couple times she looks at me and smiles and says ""Idk about you, Bansheethief."" 

Another thing she asked me was how many partners I've been with. I think I messed up here and told her the truth, 9, and she seemed to be turned off. Apparently 9 is a lot to her, and I didn't act confident and started saying different numbers, or that I was joking. Again ""Idk about you, Bansheethief."" 

A little more joking, and I go in and kiss her and we make out a bit. She then wants to leave and tells me no one is home at her place. One the walk to her place, she tells me about her bf, they've been together for 3 years. He was her first and only sexual partner. She is only with him because he has money and he doesn't really appreciate her. She says they have their own social lives and don't really talk about if they hooked up with anyone else. 

We show up at her apartment, and I think this is where it went downhill. I flirted with her somewhat, but I think I was focusing too much on having fun, and didn't escalate sexually with her. We talked about music, she showed me some Irish dance moves, etc. At one point, we started watching a movie on her couch, and I had her arm around her. I went into kiss her, and she said the more she sobers up, the more she realizes this is a bad idea. I slow down, and eventually we make our way into her bed. We are laying in bed watching a TV show and she says it is making her tired. I start trying to kiss her and she stops me and says 

* ""I'm too nice.""

* ""I'm not like most guys, who just want sex.""
* ""I remind her too much of her ex."" 
* ""I should go home."" 
* ""She thinks I'm a great guy and it is nothing wrong with me, but ""us"" can't happen tonight""
* She said she doesn't really hook up with guys like that. And she likes to get to know them first.
* She thought it was weird how we met each other through M. And she feels bad about hooking up with me.


I go to the bathroom, and come back and she is out of bed, standing by the door and tells me I should leave. I was drunk and kinda pissed, so I kept asking her what I did or said wrong and if I could just stay on the couch. I'll admit, I didn't handle getting kicked out the best, I kinda acted like an AFC, but you learn.

So in order to learn, do you guys have any advice on what I may do differently, what went wrong or what exactly happened?

Edit:
If things are over with E, how should I handle things with M. She mentioned that we can't tell M what happened. I'm not too interested in M, but I would like to keep inviting her and her friends out to party with me. Do you think she would want to next time, or just assume I'll run off with her friends?

[26M] here.  English not my first language. 
Backstory:
Stunted socially because of bullying and depression. Fought my way out of it. Started Uni. Learned social skills, got together with my first and only girlfriend. Broke up with her this summer. 

What my goals are:
Don’t want anything serious right now. Only casual, fwb, fbs, etc.

My problem:
How to propose sex to women/ transition to sex.
I find women that I would like to give some orgasms to. I talk to them make my interest shown. She smiles and looks at me expectantly…. And I draw blanks. WTF should I do now? It’s not that I am shy. As I have said, I can make my interest shown (while I’m sober to!). I can talk to people most of the time. I’m not Don Juan, but I don’t think I need to be super smooth. I have some awkward moments. But they are the mutual don’t know what to say stuff. Not so much me putting my foot in my mouth stuff. 

This is one of my priorities in life. Not my ONLY priority but I will put some effort into fixing it.
So I won’t whine or bitch to you. 
BUT it would be nice with some constructive advice.
So no just “Just be yourself and everything will be fine”. 
I know this. I have seen other people interact. But these people have had a lifetime of chances to learn how to express their personality in the most proper and productive ways. I haven’t. Please remember that.

Now reading quite a long /r/seddit I decided to make a change in my life and do the things right and so I did. Hitted the gym, got in shape, learned to have fun around other people and then booked a travel outside my country with a friend. There I met a girl in a disco that was like hb7, menaged to get her like me enough and so she asked if I walked her home. On the way I menaged to get her in the petting and kissing stuff and her asked me if I wanted to go to her apartment. I wasn't prepared at all didn't had the condoms too, so I tried to make something up and tell her if she wanted to see the next day and she agreed. The next day after spending most of the day with her I asked if she wanted to come to my apartment and she agreed. That evening we make out and at some point when I was feeling my erection pushing hard I said her if she wanted to have sex and so it was. But it was a tragedy after a bit of preliminars I started to lose the erection, to feel nervous even if I tried not to and just relax. Everytime I menaged to got it again at the moment of the penetration or some intercourse act it would go off again. After quite a bit I got to have a lasting erection, she ride me cowgirl style but I couldn't menage to get the orgasm,and the penis just kept slippering out. It was so painful. It all endend up with me fingering her to get a pair of orgasm and me not any at all and aching balls.

Was I too much nervous?Could it be the condom the problem that wasn't I used to it (scarse) sensitivness?Wasn't I much attracted to the girl?

Please give me some feedback on this, because I am more scared to do it again than I was before.

However, there are two things I'm worried about and trying to find a way to work with:

 * First of all, I'm always ""looking for a oneitis"", if that makes sense: like the saying goes, I put the pussy on a pedestal, and let my fantasies go with it. I do have multiple targets at the moment, but the one I had the contact with most recently is the one I keep thinking about all day, looking for ways to increase my chances, planning stuff, etc.

 * Secondly, and this is related to the previous one, I totally overthink things, which leads to a point that actually asking girls out makes me feel awkward and feels weird.

On Friday, at the end of our second ten-minute IM conversation, I had to leave while she was away from the computer for a minute, so I just said ""I've gotta run. Let's have a drink some time.  My number is [#],"" and headed out.

She texted me the next evening, I think to feel out whether I'd want to join her and her friends at a club. I was at a party that I didn't want to leave, so I played it cool but friendly. (Side note: I wasn't running game at the party, but there was this guy there who was a natural.  Before he got there, everyone kept asking the hostess, ""Where's [guy]?"" When he got there, he instantly gathered a crowd. He's kind of goofy, but when you talk he makes really strong eye contact and smiles, and he lightly kinos everyone, men and women, when talking to them. As a result of this, I think, everyone LOVES him. It's really funny to watch.)

On Monday, the girl and had a third IM conversation and decided to meet the next day at a bar with live music. The place can get pretty crowded, so I got there early to make sure we'd have a good place to sit. I chose a bench over chairs, and then chatted with the waitress until my date arrived.

It started very awkwardly. I stood up to go for a hug or a handshake, depending on her signals, but she was surprised and kind of dodged any greeting altogether. (It didn't help that the waitress arrived simultaneously to ask what we wanted to drink, which added to the physical/spacial confusion.) Eventually we got seated, got our beers, and got the conversations going. Her body language continued to be very standoffish, she was keeping about six inches between us on the bench, and was showing no IOIs whatsoever. The conversation was very good, though, and I threaded like a pro. It took about two hours, three beers, and very slowly-escalating kino (a little elbow here, a brushed thigh there) to get her to warm up, though by the end we were sitting with no space between us and my hand on her leg. I'd thought it might be a good idea to move to another bar once or twice, but she was really into the music, so we stayed for three hours. I had already let slip that I'd driven there and could give her a ride home, so when the music ended we headed for my car.

When I stopped the car in front of her building, she started acting all awkward in a kiss-me sort of way, so I did. Then I said, ""We're blocking the street,"" and kissed her again. Then: ""Can I come up and meet [her cat]?"" She assented. After a quick tour, we ended up cuddling on the couch watching tv, and . . . to continue would be too explicit for seddit :)

We're going out again soon.

(Note for online daters: Her profile made it sound like she would not be up for sex, at least on the first several dates. In fact, the site's ""analysis"" had her as way less interested in sex than most. But she certainly was quite interested by the end of the evening, and as far as I can tell she feels pretty good about it now. Make of that what you will.)

&gt; I've been reading Napoleon Hill's Think and Grow Rich, and I want to suggest something related. If you regularly masturbate, you can easily become addicted. This addiction comes in the form of daily regularity that curbs your desire to go out. It also does not allow you to harness your sex drive, which can be used to motivate yourself to work on wealth-building projects.


&gt; If you aren't getting laid on a regular basis (which happens to all of us from time to time), then don't just choke 'til you're broke. Set a date with yourself. Only jerk it once a week. If you jerked it today, set the jerk date for seven days from now. If you don't get a girl between then and now, you'll have something to look forward to. Make it a good jerk! Use the best porn and hand lotion. Look forward to it and this will keep you from wasting your life away jerking it daily and focusing constantly on the pain of not having a girlfriend.


&gt; In the meantime, harness your sex drive and build something.""


-- Mystery, The Game


Once upon a time, I was a porn addict. The first time I quit, it was because I was sick to my stomach of jacking off to pixels on my 17"" CRT monitor. I just kept repeating to myself, ""I need a woman"". It was impossible to be any more of an AFC.

So I went cold turkey, found a woman, and married her. Then I lived happily ever after.

Or not. I gradually relapsed and struggled with addiction, until recently when I quit again, for good this time. Then I discovered the PUA community, came across Mystery's quote, and had an epiphany. If you want to stop being a wanker, gain confidence, and improve your quality of life, you must do two things:

1. Connect with people.
2. Develop Inner Game. 

So I'm in this game for those two things. I don't want to kiss women, make out with them, or even get their numbers, necessarily. Well, maybe I do, deep down. But I'm married, and I'm a man of principles, so I won't.

I just want the self improvement: to fix my marriage, be comfortable around women, gain confidence, and increase my alpha male behaviour and body language. Did I mention I want to gain confidence? I want to ooze it. O-O-Z-E. On demand. Around women. Around AMOGs. In job interviews. Everywhere.

(The only exception I take with Mystery is to never jerk off, period. If you're not having sex, use your sex drive to improve your life.)

So I'm currently reading The Game and watching PU material on YouTube. I've also watched Season 2 of the Pickup Artist, which was entertaining, but suspiciously edited, and the rejections were highly cringeworthy. I found them difficult to watch because they reflect my own failures with women and my fear of rejection.

So with all that out of the way, here's where I currently am: I've been approaching sarging as a complete pussy. I've only been approaching girls in customer service, typically retail stores. They don't require openers, since they approach you, and I've found the less attractive ones easier to talk to. My goals so far have been to smile at girls, maintain eye contact at all times, exude alpha male body language, and improve my banter. My skills in all of these areas have dramatically improved, and each day I take it a step further. Today, I ended each encounter with ""By the way, my name is nowisforever"", and extended my hand out for a handshake. They then shook my hand and told me their names. This felt like a breakthrough (AFC, I know).

My banter is much better than before. I can now adapt better to conversations -- for example, if a girl has an accent, I ask her where she's from, tell her I plan to visit there one day, and ask her for sight seeing tips. It's good fun. I've also used a couple of openers, said hello to a couple of girls, teased a couple of girls browsing store items, and attempted to neg a bit.

All of which is pretty lame, I know. Next, I plan to approach girls on the street, probably with an opinion opener. ""I need a female opinion on &lt;insert made up topic here&gt;"". I liked the way this worked with retail girls, it really perked their attention.

I also plan to meet more people, improve my banter skills, keep talking to everybody (men and women), and touch people more (kino). **But I feel like I'll going to get stuck switching from banter to teasing / flirting / sexual signals. From watching The Pickup Artist, the typical solution to that is negging and kino, so I might try that, but please share with me what you've done here.**

I'm also thinking of inviting girls for lunch or a drink in the same vicinity, instead of asking for their numbers, as a way to continue the conversation. This is all going to be day game, by the way. I'm not going into the clubbing or night scene -- not my thing.

But already, my understanding of women has increased, I've seen dramatic improvement in my marriage, and my confidence has increased. I can summon that ""I'm awesome"" feeling much more regularly than before. And with confidence comes a clearer outlook on life. For example, I used to always plan to get industry certifications, and I'd beat myself up when I'd put them off. Now, I realise that I hate studying, especially when there's no immediate payoff. So, fuck certifications. Only chumps do shit they don't want to do. I'll do what I feel like -- what I'd do if I were a millionaire with all the time in the world.

That said, I have no illusions about what I'm doing (sarging), and I must admit I'm pretty uncomfortable with it. I hope I don't take it too far, and I hope to 'retire' after acquiring the social skills I need.

Final thought: In some ways, I regret finding this after being entrenched in a relationship, because it would have been fun to go on a bit of a journey in my younger days. In fact, the more I learn about PU, the more I see my mistakes in hindsight, and realise that I could have had those girls whom I had crushes on. But if I had, I would have a very different life today.

I texted her saying I thought I saw her walking to her car as I parked and made my way to class. She asked me about when, and I told her.

Then she dropped this on me: ""I was already home at that time, so it couldn't have been me. I know wishful thinking can be powerful, but you should get it checked if it's causing hallucinations.""

My reaction was ""damn!""

To put things into perspective, we had a couple classes together, and on the first day of last semester, I could have f-closed her in her car, on campus, but I had a commitment. She started flirting with me more and more, even in front of my girlfriend at the time, and finally I had to get her to stop, because it was all really obvious and inappropriate, and made my girlfriend uncomfortable, so I put distance between us. We carried out the rest of the semester as friends, and no bad feelings between us.

I've run into her a couple of times this semester, so I figured why not.

I don't really care which way it goes. I was wasn't expecting that response from her, but I know I can just turn into meeting up with her tonight. Looking for a good way to dish it back. IDGAF, honestly.

[M19]

I'm not even trying to get them in bed; I'm just trying to start conversations with people. If college girls are so easy to fuck, then what the hell am I doing wrong if I'm talking to girls around my dorm and getting the cold shoulder? Do they only hook up at clubs?

I've been doing better with saying stuff off the top of my head and randomly saying hello, but it's not clicking for anyone. After literally one of the top 4 hottest girls I've seen this year got on the treadmill next to me (even though *all* the others were free) while working out, and I didn't even say hi to her, I got so mad at myself. I'm still mad at myself, but it got me started randomly talking more.

 * I'm not sure if this is healthy, but sometimes I start to hate myself for not talking to girls so much that I just have to go run at least 1 1/2 miles before I am calm again. Maybe this is an adrenaline addiction? I realize, ""what the fuck am I doing with myself?"" then can't stop raging until I work out for a good 45 minutes. This happens at least once a week. Am I just frustrated with my life and trying to feel productive, or is this a medical thing? For now, I will let it ride out because it gets me to the gym. In the past (before Seddit), I was normally depressed, but now I'm normally at least a little angry... This isn't helping my game, needless to say =\

Last night, there was a cute girl sitting alone in the laundry room, and I said ""heellooOO"" in as friendly as a tone as I could. I honestly don't remember if she said anything in reply, but a few seconds later she put her hood up so that she was ""concealed."" I took this as a ""don't talk to me signal."" In retrospect, I should have asked, ""something wrong?"" or at least tried to joke around with her about something... It didn't help that I gave no eye contact or smile. 

I am really paranoid of girls at my dorm ""blowing the whistle,"" as it were, and getting me in trouble for ""harassing"" them. That actually happened to me last year when I cold approached for a number (which she gave me before she reported me to management... Yes, it was her real number, too. Wtf?) The whole experience was really traumatizing, and I'm still paranoid, but it killed a ton of my AA in the long run. This was before Seddit even, but I've been thinking about how ballsy it was for how little confidence I had at the time... It was horrible because I had the mentality, ""what do I have to lose?"" and life basically answered with, ""THIS!"" and then punched me in the face. I'm trying to tell myself that I have the proper confidence not to come off as a creep, but it's still in the back of my mind.

 * I think my biggest problem right now is the inability to reflexively smile. I can only smile when it's genuine, which I can't break out for strangers too often unless they actually make me laugh, which is hard to do. My teeth aren't bad looking, but my smile looks really shitty unless I get the face muscles and jaw placement right. A genuine smile looks great, but my fake smile, the one that I would use to greet people, is hard to get in order. How do you guys get the smiling thing down? Does it need to be real? Can I effectively fake being happy to see a complete stranger?

Thanks, sorry that this is a mixed post. I didn't think 3 separate posts was necessary.



**tl;dr**
College guy with decent looks and low level game can't get any girls despite how ""easy"" college girls are. What are these girls looking for? When? How do I give it to them properly? Is looking for a LTR with college girls a dumb idea?

I have started to get really angry at myself about my failures with women when I am alone in my room, thinking about how badly I fucked up and how easy it would have been for me to make their day with a few words. The only thing to make me calm down is a long workout. Adrenaline addiction or teen angst?

Finally, tips on how to get a natural looking smile? Should I make myself laugh with funny videos and then hold the smile as long as I can? Maybe there's no solid advice on this other than ""practice makes perfect.""

Thanks!

For example, I grew the balls to approach a girl and start talking to her at a club the other night. She was from Taiwan, quite hot. Once I start talking to her, two other guys behind us go ""Oh you're from Taiwan, same with us!"" and start talking with her in Taiwanese, leaving me to dry.

I manage to get her onto the dance floor and, sure enough, these guys come back with drinks for her. I didn't know what to do. I didn't want to seem needy by competing for her, so I went off looking for other girls. It's very frustrating though, she was a hottie. 

This has happened a few times, I defeat my (very strong) AA in approaching a girl, then a guy swoops in with drinks or a language connection (I'm in Asia right now). I hate competing for the girl, so I usually bail.

So, I feel like this post is long, long due. Tonight, I got fed up with my long-lasting frustrations. For a long time (since I was 16), I've been having these frustrations, and simply haven't had a place to 'reflect on them' and rationalize my thoughts. The reason I am posting this in seddit is because it is a social issue, and I think the more experienced seddit crowd, is the best suited community to give advice on this particular issue.

Since I was rather young I've been hanging out with a particular crowd relatively often (party occasions mainly). This crowd consists of the biggest social/womanizing-champions of my rather large suburb and the nearby suburbs, meaning that the average person in this crowd will outgame about 90 % of all guys, while several of them are the biggest womanizers I've met in my entire life. 

My frustrations stem from the fact that I've never truly been in this crowd. Not fully. I've always thought that in time, I'll get there. Tonight I once again saw that I'm not truly respected in the crowd. I'm rarely notified when people leave to go to a different bar etc.I've continuosly considered these people my close friends, although I don't get invited to a lot of the casual events, such as chilling with weed and a movie etc. The thing is, I've compared every single group of people I've met over the last couple of years with these guys, and no one is really as cool as them. I've always wanted to associate myself with them, and a lot of people outside of this group do indeed associate me with them. 

Today it occured to me that my glorification of this crowd might have been holding me back - I've never considered myself truly 'worthy' of awesome company. I'm 'the shit' among people I don't consider cool, but I kind of hold back whenever I meet big personalites. I've also continuously looked down on all the people I've considered below my social standards. 

Writing this, I can see how ridiculous this is, but I'd still very very very much appreciate your comments. All the people in my classes are socially awkward (really, not being derogatory here), and my other group of friends don't really share my inclination to drink/party at least twice a week.On the surface I appear rather succesful I presume, but I don't feel good about my life at all. I feel as if I have no one who is 'close' to me. 

Today, for the first time, it occured to me that I might not be 'as cool', as I've always thought I was. Although I'm not shy, I'm more hesitant to approach random girls than most of the guys in the aforementioned group (this group consists of 20-25 people). I have a lot of really depressing thoughts concerning my existance, and I'm afraid I'm kinda losing touch with reality. I've dealt with these thoughts on a daily basis for years, and I'd love to hear what someone else thinks about them. What direction should I go with my social life?

In my mind, you need to build some comfort because everyone is sort of creeped out by internet dating and meeting complete strangers. Most of these girls are reluctant to meet a guy they just started messaging, at least it seems that way to me. I don't refer to anything sexual in my messages, in hopes of not coming off as a creep.

I can’t ask normal people for help because first of all that is apparently weird to them or perceived as whinny.  Secondly, most people who know me a little think I'm popular and date hot women; most people who know me well think I'm amazing and don't understand why I have a hard time making friends, not that any of these people call me or propose hanging-out some time.  I have to do most of the work.

And I think that is a main problem.  People don’t seem to be interested although I am plenty interesting and plenty interested in others.  How do you get people interested in you enough that they call you and ask you to hang out?  I’ve read and tried, twice, all of the readily available suggestions and information out there.  

I know a lot of friendships are essentially business based.  Personally, I like to be friends with people because I like them and I don’t want anything more from them than friendship. 

Can some fantastic person give a very technical breakdown on how people decide who they are interested in and who they want to befriend?  
How do you get people interested in you enough that they call you and ask you to hang out?  
Also, advice on how to build a social circle and be at least mildly popular would be super duper appreciated.  


Have a wonderful day all you helpful helpful people.

We didn't talk much during our classes since she was with her friends and I was with mine. I couldn't tell if she was shy or not interested.

Once, during my birthday I drunkly called her and proposed her a beer together, but still, it was my birthday and it would be awkward if she refused. It was the end of the semester so I didn't have the time to go out with her then.

After a 4 month summer break, when we hadn't seen each other, it turned out that she moved in to the next room in the dorm. I live in 401 and she lives in 402 - that is a crazy coincidence.

I have already grabbed some beer and tea at her place, but I am wondering how can I take an advantage of the fact of how close we live to each other.

She's my ex-roommates ex-gf, They broke up about 6 months ago when he left the country. She's super cool, attractive, and there is obvious chemistry and sexual tension between us. I really like her. I have previously turned down an advance or two from her because I was seeing someone (aorn, I think she is loosely involved with someone, but not sure). Past that, I was and am also uncomfortable with her being ""his girl"", even though its been this long, both for sexual reasons and innate reasons which feel like I'm breaking some sort of rules. I'm not sure what I want with her, ultimately.

We hang out every week or three, pseudo-dates, I guess. It's great. We've discussed doing an acting class together, so she facebooked a link to an acting class (6 weeks long, once a week), with a message. Here is the important part.
""I'd like to do it with you but it's out of my budget, you wanna give me a delayed birthday present? ;) you actually forgot to get me one!!"" (Her bday was in Dec, I don't even remember it).

So the class is 230$. To be fair, I'm extremely well off, she knows this, and 200$ to me is worth about 10-20$ to the average man (it's more or less a negligible sum). It's more the symbolism that bothers me, and I'm worried about people using me for money. I'd be a bit more comfortable if she offered half. Should I counter-offer for her to pay half or something like that? Am I being ridiculous? I can't tell.

I am very careful about how I use my wealth, for fear of being used, and sending a message. I am also very controlling, and this probably has something to do with it. I don't think she is using me, and I think we will have a blast, but really importantly, I don't want to appear as a pushover, especially towards someone who may be a future partner...

My backstory: Been in a LTR since I was 17 (25 now), we broke up about 3 months prior.  Outside of work I have one female friend, which is not really a oneitis situation, but she is my ONLY social life, and I see her once a week.  I literally have ZERO friends.  

So I decided I would read about PUA and attempt to turn my life around, but it seems whenever I go out, I can't bring myself to approach ANYONE.  I have gone out 7 times and the only stranger I have opened was a 50 year old lady in the grocery store (off hand comment about salad dressing).

This is where I need your help.. How do I get out of my head and just get out there and meet people?  At this point I would be satisfied even just meeting a few guys to have as friends.  I feel so intimidated by everyone, and therefore never approach.  Also, I don't drink, so going to bars is pretty useless.  Where do I meet people and where do I get the motivation to approach?

Finally, the last piece of the puzzle I need to work on is staying in state.  The closest city where there is an abundance of people is 45 minutes away, and I get out of state by the time I get there, and end up being nervous and chode-ish.

Throw me to the wolves guys, I need your best advice to turn my life around and meet at least ONE person TOMORROW! I can not put my social life off any longer!

I have been getting into reddit over the past month, but upon finding this subreddit I have finally motivated myself to make an account. I am always too nervous to post anything, so I generally just opt to remain anonymous, but here goes... Here is my story...seeking any sort of insight you can give me about why I allow my life to suck :\

About Me: I am a senior in college. I am rather athletic, not ripped beyond all means, but I do cardio for 60 minutes every day and lift 3 times a week to stay healthy and fit. I am quite tall (6'4"") and I wouldn't say I am unspeakably handsome but I believe that there is nothing about my face that would make me not handsome. I consider myself to be an enriched guy; I know tons about music, culture, the world, and I am a huge nerd with like LOTR, Star Wars, etc. :p. But I don't act socially awkward about it, in general I am very civil and down to earth in conversations. I just have a deep respect for great literature and it is sort of my own means of getting away from everything. I am quite intelligent, I will be going to graduate school or med school upon graduation (still haven't committed, its a hard choice...). I am a very honest, down to earth guy. I hardly ever lie. If someone wants to know something, I will tell them. That being said, I despise liars. I am very romantic and committed. I have a plethora of romantic things thought up in my mind that I would just love to do for a girl that I fall in love with one day. I can hardly deceive my friends, nonetheless if I ever fell in love with a girl it would be basically guaranteed that I would never hurt or betray her trust. My friends always come to me for advice because I am so good at analyzing situations and coming to practical solutions. Ironically, I cannot do this for myself. So here I am, on my knees, asking you guys for help...

My Story: I always imagined as a kid that college would be the place where I meet my significant other. And in all honesty, I feel like it HAS to be. I am one of those ""really timid around strangers, most lovable outgoing guys around friends"" types. So outside of college, when I am not put into situations like classes or what-not, I don't ever see myself having an opportunity to interact with females. Again, feel free to call me out on any of this if you raise a valid counterargument I'd love to hear it. But here is my logic: I am very particular with women. I cannot stand shallow women. I cannot stand ditsy girls who think acting stupid is cute. I cannot stand women who are so unsophisticated that they can't carry out a 3 minute conversation without resorting to talking about someone else. And I am just so afraid that once I get my doctorate and am making bank that I will just have really shallow, soulless females hitting on me and it will become too hard to sift through and find real women anymore. So I would really like to meet a down to earth female now, or else I fear I will have lost my chance for ever. I have met many females that I have liked a lot. In fact, I probably have more females in my life than males. The kicker? Friend-zoned by all of them. Literally, I am extremely close friends with over 10 just down-to-earth, beautiful girls who never fail to make me smile, except when I am alone and think about how much it hurts to just be friends with all of them.

My Problem: I have zero self confidence. I have never had an ""official"" girlfriend, although I have had minor flings with girls for 2-3 weeks that have ended up flopping. I am not a virgin, but I don't get laid a ton. I am much more interesting in finding a girlfriend rather than just finding sex, but if it comes down to it I feel like just being able to initiate hookups is still better than nothing so I wouldn't say I am opposed to that. I wouldn't say I am uncomfortable around females, in fact the quite the opposite. Think of my confidence as an exponential curve over time...it is just that when I see a girl that I think is pretty and that I don't know...I just get stopped in my tracks...if over time I get to know her that anxiety fades quickly but by that point I am already friendzoned.

Being in a lot of high level courses that are rather nerdy, there are like zero females in my classes anymore. I live with all dudes who have like only dude friends. It has become so hard to find girls through these two means anymore (every girl I have had a fling with I met through class or a friend). So I have to learn to adapt to the real world. On my campus, the bars are a very very social setting, so don't think of them as like small town bars full of creepers and adults. Whenever I go out, there are plenty of young, attractive girls who I know to be intelligent because I have had classes with them in the past in my pre-med coursework. So when I read posts saying ""dont meet girls at the bars"", I feel like that doesn't apply very well to me. I have had friends who have actually met really legit girls at the bars here and they are still dating.

So with all that said, how should I structure myself as to be able to make my case for myself at the bars? Specifically:

1) How do you know if a girl wants you to approach her? I seem to always get put into the situation where I hit on a girl who didn't want to be hit on and she thinks I am a creep. A lot of my ladyfriends say they usually find it creepy when they get hit on in the bars, but not always. This brings up my next question:

2) What is creepy, and what is not creepy, when meeting a girl at the bar for the first time? And most importantly...

3) Why am I so scared to talk to girls...what should I say? People say that literally ""Hi, I am..."" works. But I simply cannot comprehend how something like that would differentiate me from any of the other guys who have hit on that girl that she shot down. I feel like I have a ton going for me, but all that is in vane if I can't communicate that. You are my last hope r/seduction. Save me from a life alone as a lost, compassionate guy who had to spend his life alone because he was a coward...

Upvotes are appreciated...not because I am a karma whore but rather it increases my chance of getting a meaningful answer, so if you don't like my post please just move on, too many downvotes defeat the purpose of this post..

EDIT: I just want to say thank you for pretty much everyone's replies. Pretty much everyone has had some really nice tidbit to say and I appreciate it. I will try and implement all of these (without thinking too hard, should be natural!). To all you out there who are extremely confident, never undervalue that trait.

Normally this wouln't be an issue, but I did let her stay over at my place a few months back when she was feeling a bit down, and I didn't sleep with her. We just slept in the same bed, as I was working that day and really was not in the mood to try and get any action.

My question is how do I capitalize on this situation? What would you do in my shoes? 

UPDATE::

So here's what happened guys, I would've added the update sooner, but I had some errands to run this morning. 

She came over around 8:30 or 9. She didn't seem to be too sad about anything, she actually seemed really hyper and happy. We sat in the kitchen and caught up for a bit, I poured her a glass of wine, and we just started talking and joking around. After some good laughs, I cleaned up and then I asked if she wanted to go watch the movie, she agreed. When we made our way to the living room I made a joke along the lines of ""Oh this is a pretty stereotypical date. Usually I'm more creative."" she laughed and said ""I've had worse dates, I think this will be fun.""

I was joking about the date thing, but now she confirmed it so I took it as an invitation to start escalation. When we sat down, I sat pretty close to her, with our legs touching. I grabbed a blanket and put it over her, then she said ""Well, where's your blanket?"" I said ""I don't need one, I'm a really warm person."" She asked me to prove it, so this is where I took ObiWan111's advice on the massage. I said ""Turn around, I'll show you."" I reached my hands up her shirt and massaged her back, she seemed to be enjoying it. She placed her hand on my leg, and said ""What about the movie?"" I said ""Well, this is a little more fun than a movie don't you think?"" she laughed, turned around and we started to make out.

The rest is as you may imagine. All in all, I had a good night! And she was gone by 9am the next morning so that was nice. Thanks for your tips, Seddit! They worked pretty well. 

If I've learned anything from this experience, it's what innitgrand said. Just because she's in your social circle, doesn't mean you can't escalate. In some situations it may even be easier to escalate because she's in your social circle.

I'm in a crisis.  I can no longer believe in myself.  Please take some time out of your lives, and hear me out.

Arguably, the world has been truly connected, for only about the last 10 years.  When I was born, the internet was still in its infancy, but we were slowly finding a way to connect to each other to share information at a revolutionary speed.

Fast forward to 2012.  We have social networks, video, blogs, tweets, chat, and dating.  The world is finally connected -- you can push a button and get an instant glimpse of someone else's life.  On reddit, you can browse posts where hundreds of people share wonderfully written editorials about their life experiences, lessons and opinions.

I can't say how much I've matured from learning about the world, and the amazing people in it.  But at the same time, a slow and subconscious despair has crept upon me.

Before reddit, before facebook, I used to be a cocky, confident motherfucker.  I worked hard since I was a kid, had a great education, good friends, and I knew I was fucking smart.  That must have been as close to natural game as I've ever gotten -- I talked to girls, believing to the bottom of my heart that I was an absolute gem, a gold mine.  I made them laugh, and I had the energy to take on the world.  I knew, beyond any shadow of a doubt, that my opinions on everything were absolutely, unequivocally, correct.

But that was because I was living in a bubble.  I didn't understand the world, and how many people truly were just as amazing, and often times, far more amazing than me.  And reddit showed me, and when I got into college, facebook showed me that I was but a small star in a cosmos of supernovas.

I am 21 years old now.  I will be graduating from an excellent university, full of excellent people, moving to an excellent career.  But I no longer believe in myself.  My girlfriend of two years, someone I had spent every waking hour with as a confidant, a best friend, and a partner, broke up with me about a year ago.  She is the same major as me.  I taught her most of what she knows.  But I don't know if I actually made a positive impact on her life.

When I talk to girls, all I can think about anymore is how much better someone else would be in the same situation.  How much more interesting, passionate, and charismatic they would be.  And every time I give an opinion, I think about the fact that maybe my opinion isn't right.  And maybe, when I encourage someone to do something, that it won't make their life better, that it's not the right thing to do.

I'm paralyzed.  I have a million questions, and no answers, and no way to break out of this funk.  So seddit...

If you are under 30 please only respond if you are sharing the methods of a man 30 or older who never had a relationship before.  Perhaps if you have been in the scene long enough you know of somebody. 

--------------------------------

It seems the outline from real people in my circumstance responding to my question where I asked elsewhere goes like this for a guy over 30 with little to no experience:
 
* Under go a physical or personality change(such as accepting your gay or losing weight) or have you friends push you into asking a girl out.

* The girl is a coworker or a friend that has known you from before and understands your difficulty and leads you through this and raises your confidence.  Or in the case of being gay after a couple years of searching in online dating you find somebody.

* You now are either in a good relationship and maintain it or you now have the confidence, skills, and experience from that friend to find a relationship elsewhere

* You now are married or in a very satisfactory long term relationship.

I get up the courage, and take her out to coffee. 2 hours of talking and lots of IOI but I don't go for the kiss close. Next day we walk together and I set up the next date, ""Your place, I'll cook."" She seems excited and blushes. Two hours before the date she texts saying she is really sorry but she's feeling sick due to vaccinations. I play it off like it's no big deal and tell her to feel better. She asks to reschedule for next tuesday and I say sounds good. 

Fast forward to that tuesday, I talk to her after class and ask her if we are still on for tonight. She says, ""Yes...I would have to flop over dead to cancel."" 2 hours before date I get a text, ""My roomie said there is free tacos from the taco bus and wants me to go with her :/."" I don't play it well (at this point i've spent $50+ on marinated salmon) and say ""So I'll be at your place at 6:30 or you're flaking on me for cheap tacos? ;)."" She responds with ""Well since you put it in a mean way :/."" 

Did I just completely blow it with this girl? Unfortunately we see eachother everyday and sit next to eachother. She shows a lot of interest, but why flake on second date that she rescheduled? Do I drop the number and move on? 

~~~~Update: Had class with her today. She flirted the whole time with the guy behind us (it was a review session). I proceeded to not give a fuck and it ended up him and I talking the whole time while she got sidelined. No IOI that I could spot for me other than a few laughs. I had no idea how to approach the situation except to pretend like the flake didn't happen. Didn't escort her after class. Radio Silence. On to the next one.

**update:**Two days later. She sets up date, my place at 9pm. Planning to flake first to build interest and because I have another date. So far so good.

I've found many things here to really help me in getting social and being a more confident man, so I first want to thank you all for that.

My problem is that, in these events where a bunch of people including many of my friends gather, there's one guy who always seems to seek me out. He then starts giving me a hard time before anyone I'm talking with (and there are usually women within an earshot or I'm talking with some). And if I start responding to him the same way, it quickly becomes a verbal cockfight and everyone gets turned off, especially the women.

His needling includes stuff like: mockingly praising things about me like what I wear and my position in the event, always trying to one-up everything I say with a lecturing, patronizing tone and look, trying to get me out of the conversation by focusing on my conversation partner(s) while ignoring me, and finally trying to get physically between me and the people I'm talking with (stealthily, of course).

I don't think I could just ignore him either, since we're all part of the same social circle and so he's friendly with those other people just like I am. And I can't seem to befriend him either since he's always verbally aggressive with me from the start (again, especially with women around). I try to be accommodating to a point, but he ignores it and just plows on.

I usually enjoy myself with public events but his regular appearances and behavior really does tend to screw things up for me. I just want to be able to enjoy being with my social circle, so this is not so much about seducing anyone but this thing that's apparently called ""AMOG"".

That's my first post on a seduction-related subreddit. I've read quite a few articles on Seddit, plus a lot of pick-up books in my life but still haven't gotten laid much (3 f-close, about 20-30 k-close in 3 years).
I really want to get more women into my bed but at the same time I loathe being with the majority of them 'cause I find them immature, uninteresting, etc. (I feel like I have to do all the talking because she got nothing to say, you know what I mean?).


But recently I met a class-mate of one of my friend. After speaking 5 minutes with her I felt something like ""she's fucking smart, and she's fucking beautiful too"" (half Polish, half Italian, half high IQ)^1 because of her beauty, her many talents, etc. I've done something I forbid myself to: I've fallen in love.
So we've seen each other three time before her exams but couldn't go for a kiss (did kino, compliments-negs, what I've learned so far), I could say she was interested.
We've seen each other (she wrote to me) again on Saturday with a dozen of friends. We were playing truth-or-dare^2 and we kissed. Fast-forward some hours: I rejoin my friends I left to get some food and her, we talk for a bit, an other friend I know since childhood kissed her and I went raging-jealous: I punched him out of my mind.^3 Then we talk a bit and she admit she's deeply in love with the friend who introduced her to me but that ""there can be more than one"", began to cry because he really don't care about her, etc. so I go to comfort her. We talk, we laugh, I gently tease her and she's looking at me with a sexy look but couldn't go for a k-close. Then it was about 4:30 and everyone went home. She sent me a sms from the taxi only saying: ""Thank you.""


Now here's where I'm lost: I still deeply want her (this feeling of wanting to marry her) but I don't know how to turn the Game: should I write to her? Should I be distant? 
And more generally: how to AVOID the unholy friend-zone which I feel standing on the verge of?

1: That's on purpose.

2: I'm 22, she's 18 and my friends are 24-28.

3: I regret that and made several apologizes to him realizing what I've done.",,False,,t5_2s7xh,False,,,True,t3_18rfww,http://www.reddit.com/r/askseddit/comments/18rfww/i_crossed_the_line_help/,

As much as I hate to say it, I'm not an alpha dog all day, every day. I have horrible days, where I just want to shut the fuck up, and enjoy my own company, and that of my scotch. Sometimes, I complain. 

In my experience, creating and maintaining attraction (in general), does not have room for that kind of thing. The woman gets support from you. You want support? Buy a fucking teddy bear. The ""tortured artist"" role does have its appeal (refer to: Hank Moody), but on its own, it's just a bunch of complaining. It should be complimented with other things (such as confidence in spite of one's personal troubles, and being fun to with), and it cannot be a main feature of the man.

i knew this girl for like 5 weeks. We basically met only in group with other (always the same) students, atleast me, her and another person.

I kinda like her and i felt there were atleast some IOI (not so much). I wanted to meet her alone. So i called her and asked her out for a drink. But there wasnt really an answer.. only silence. It seemed to me, that she was absoluty overstrained. I told her that she doesn't have to but the only thing she said was like ""yeah let's see"". Then silence again and then i said something like okay and goodbye and she wished me a good evening. 


Now it gets ugly. I thought i pushed her to hard or something like that, because she is a girl which doesnt goes to clubs or stuff like this. So i texted her that i didnt wanted to bring her in distress and that i hope this doesnt affects our friendship but i had to ask her out because she is such a interesting person.

Her answer was merely short ""It's fine, see you on Wednesday regards..""

It's like some girls are OFFENDED that I talk to them (like I do not even deserve to speak to them).

I've noticed that seddit mostly caters to males but I would really like your input on  my situation, so if you could help me out I'd be really grateful. I'm 19 years old and I've always been introverted, shy and VERY awkward. I also went through an ugly duckling phase and I think it really messed up my confidence, but I'd like to think that I'm average as average can be now and sometimes I've got some positive feedback.


When I was 15 or so, I managed to become more social, gained some confidence and even managed to be with some guys, even though my former issues made me being afraid of getting into a relationship. This was all good untill I was around 17. My confidence was alright at that time but I've come across some guys who, through mockery and overall ""jerkiness"", shattered my confidence, even a girl who told me that I'm not anything special so I should just take who gives me atention (well, but she used to have a crush on me and I had to reject her so take it with a grain of salt).


From then untill now, I've noticed that I can't hold a guys atention like before, they don't give me the time of the day and I guess someone who I have a crush on just friendzoned me. On top of that, I've become as introverted as I was before and even more awkward so I don't have nearly as many friends so I don't go out much, but that has never been a problem as I'm usually great being on my own.

They all seem to center around ""I think this girl likes me but I'm not sure. What should I do?"" I'm about to tell you but don't expect too many details because in all honesty - you don't need them.

1) If you're at the stage where you don't know if a girl likes you then the very next time you see her make a move and you'll know. No excuses like ""the logistics were bad.""

2) If you're asking about text game, STOP! Do not use text game to guage a girl's interest. It's pointless. Yes, pointless! I'm not saying you can't or shouldn't flirt over text but don't come in here saying ""we flirted through texts a lot so I think she's interested."" No, it means you're not a creep and she could see you as a possible partner. Key word: possible. The only way to know for sure is to meet and and find out face to face. Use texting to set up a date.

3) This stems from #2. To set the date don't ask the girl; tell her. There should be no ? In your text. Not a single one. Be specific with your text. Day, time, and what you're doing. (Ex. ""Hey, I'm going to a concert Thursday at 7. Come with me. It'll be fun."")

4) Lastly, once on the date isolate, kino, and escalate. This one is a must. You will NEVER get a girl attracted to you and want another date without this step. Get this through your head. Kino-escalation cannot be stressed enough. Just do it! It's also best if you k-close on the 1st date. It's not 100% necessary to get the kiss but at least try. 


I hope all of this helped. A lot of you might feel as if your situation is unique but it really isn't. These things apply to to all situations. Keep in mind this is in no way detailed but it should give you some basics and a good start. 


EDIT: ok I think I need to explain myself for some of these points a little better:

1) Making a move doesn't mean taking her home necessarily. It can mean going in for the kiss or something to show obvious intent.

2) I NEVER said don't text. What I'm saying is don't use text alone to guage interest. Flirt through text all you want, but in the end meet in person or it's going nowhere.

I'm pretty decent at PUA and have cold approached girls before.

My problem is that she's usually sitting with a friend or two and I don't know how to open the group because I'm not on any common grounds with them. If she were alone I'd just open with a ""Hi."" and go from there, but since I don't know them at all it makes it a bit more trickier. Sure I could keep it simple but these are girls in HS which means they are probably shy and holding a conversation is tough without a decent topic.

Furthermore, I have heard about the technique of approaching a target in a group and ignoring her and focusing on her friend(s), especially after attraction has been shown by the girl beforehand (ie. eye contact, smiling). I'm skeptical if this is needed in high school and what to do if it backfires for example the girls being shy, giggling at nothing, etc.

I (22M) have a younger sister with a solid 9/10 friend, both of whom are 19. They've only known each other for this semester (I think) and only hang out at their school (I think.) You know, school buddies, but not deep dark secret sharing friends.

Both Sister and Friend, as I'll refer to them, go to a community college in the same town as the university to which I currently go. (for what it's worth, I used to go to said community college.) Both Sister and Friend are going to transfer to my university, Sister I'm a year, friend this winter (13) semester. 

My sister and I are really tight and talk a lot. Long story short, friend sounds really fun/cute and looks the same (shameful Facebook stalking.) My sister even, although tongue in cheek, said she should hook us up.

Back story over, now my questions. Should I pursue trying to meet Friend? I feel like I'm 14 again crushing on a girl I haven't met. The only way I see this working is to invite Sister and Friend to go out with my friends and me to get dinner and go do something after (see a hockey/basketball game our w/e). This would be relevant because both Sister and Friend are transferring to this college town. So, some kinda hang out is totally doable. How far do I go on the charm/flirting/whatever? Should I just mess around with my friends like always and Sister and Friend involved (I'm pretty good at this) or should I be more obvious with Friend that I'm into her (naturally progressing, since we've never met)

I moved because of work with absolutely no prior knowledge of the area or social connections of any kind.  I visited one time, but only for the interview, and I was very limited to interviewing and apartment / living accommodation searching.

I'm a young, single guy (23), but I literally know nobody here (fwiw, it's a large city).  I initially figured that I would rely on the people I worked with in order to make social networks and start doing fun things during the week and weekend, but to my disappointment, literally everyone in the office is married or in serious relationships.  Trust me, I've been looking, but the office is pretty small (about 30 people).  I've already tried getting people to go to the bars, or a golf trip, or poker night, but it seems to be a brick wall as far as that goes.

So, as the standard computer aficionado with a problem would do, I began to search for solutions on the internet.  Therefore, I'm very new to the ""seddit"" scene.  Within the last few of weeks of moving was when I chanced upon it and began reading frequently.  I'm also relatively new to reddit in general (so if I'm doing it wrong, be nice -_-)

I feel pretty comfortable in social situations in which I am placed (ie classroom in college, or parties I've been invited to from people I know previously, workspace, etc...), but when it comes to randomly picking up women or making friends, I feel that I'm not very good.  I'm certainly a beginner when it comes to seddit and PUs in general.

So my question is, where do I start?  Or is it something that just takes time to evolve and I'm being too impatient.

First off, I'm a 20 year old student, I used to be a bit of a shy guy, I've never had a girlfriend, and have started to man up both physically and socially (losing weight and social awkwardness, essentially).

I've been reading seddit, and it's terrific. Tofutofu especially, if you happen to read this, thanks a lot for your terrific FRs. I'm very much a beginner though, having only approached one woman since I began improving myself in earnest a couple of weeks ago. 

I'm trying to get used to approaching girls, and my university is rather small, so is it anywhere possible to have success by just going up to a woman I don't know in the street in the middle of the day, and say something along the lines of ""hey, you look friendly and sexy, how about a cup of coffee?"", or something like that. Basically, is approaching an unknown woman and being *that* direct a good idea? My thoughts are that it could help with AA, as in getting used to approaching people, but does it have any chance of success?

As I said, I approached only one woman since I began to work on myself. She was with one of her friends in the bus, I noticed her, but didn't know either her or her friend. She was an HB7-ish, and had  an unusual pair of earrings on, so I figured, well, if we get off at the same stop, I'll go and compliment her on her earrings. I did it and felt like a boss afterwards, even if it didn't lead to anything. Am I on the right track? If I continue this way, am I going to get anywhere?

Morning time, We woke up and chilled for abit and she brought up the fact that she was nervous as it was my first time and that's why she said no, And she isn't sure if I'm sure I want to do it. Mindfuck ensued, What do you say back to that? I tried telling her it doesn't bother me I think you're over thinking it, But she said she had never been with a virgin before so felt more nervous than me or something..She text me awhen I got home again asking how I feel about what she said, Any ideas how to make her feel this it is no big deal for me?

Added to that, I'm pretty tall for my age (15). I study in a private school with all the uniforms and everything.

A lot of times when I talk to people, at some point they will *always* tell me that they originally thought I was really scary and intimidating, like they were afraid that if they say something wrong, I'd hit them square in the face or something.
In reality I'm a really cheerful guy, I smile a lot and tend to do a lot of stupid things with my friends, since with them I'm in a state where I just think *""I don't care what I'm doing, I'm having fun""*
Yet, even if I'm like this people still find me scary. My first thought would be when I'm not smiling, cause my blank face makes me seem pissed, and if I'm not around me friends, I go deep into thought so I get that face..

Seriously, it's weird. One time a classmate of mine was making a joke about me, which I found particularly funny, but while I was laughing I could hear his friend whisper *""Dude, don't say something like that! He might punch you!""* He wasn't saying it as if he was joking either.

This kind of thing makes me seem unapproachable. One of my girl friends told me that when we were first seated together, she was scared of me, but once as I opened my mouth we easily got along.

She's now disappointed in herself....which makes me feel like pickup is both a blessing and a curse.,18,2,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/askseddit/comments/11zvz2/f_closed_shes_now_disappointed_in_herselfwhich/,"**Seddit, I need some outside perspective on this issue.  What have you guys done after having successful lays?  Do you move on to new girls?  or do you try and move them to a LTR?**

**Quick background** -I'm 32 (Asian). She's 22 (Blonde). Both of us came out of 3 yr LTR's and both single for 1 year.  I've never had a one night stand.  She was absolutely devasted by her last relationship.

-------
From a pickup point of view, everything was amazing.  The 3rd night that I met with her I was working on my Escalation Anxiety since i've always had difficulty going in for the actual kiss.  


Also, I've been working on my inner game to assume attraction (since being asian and picking up on hot blonde was something i never thought i could do).


I am stoked because i broke through my mental barrier with the skills I learned from this community (there was a post on EA and another with RSD Tyler talking about reality destroying that helped my inner game).


Well after we had sex, the next day I could tell something was noticeably wrong. She was upset and wanted to talk.  


She basically told me, *""I've never move that quickly with anyone before and I'm really disappointed in myself.  I always take things slow, even with all my previous relationships.  I value my body and never done that with anyone.  Even with my previous boyfriends we dated for months before I did anything with them.""*


I assumed this is the typical ASD speech that girls give men. Since this was my first one night stand, in a sense, i didnt take it all that seriously. 


But after talking to her over the next week or so, I realize that she is telling me the truth. 
I've grown to really like this girl the more i get to know her, and I'm developing one-itis with her.  


We met up yessterday and she basically said to me, *""I'm so disappointed that i violated my own beliefs and it really concerns me.  There are areas of my life that I'm not happy with, and the fact that I was willing to move that quickly with you hurts me.  Because we had sex I've mentally written us off from having a relationship."" * WTF?!


Damn, this is a **Male Attraction trigger** if I've ever felt one.  The fact that she is willing to walk away turns me on like fucking crazy.


I should also point out that she's in a transition in her life.  She had a shitty job that called her off 4 days in a row which is making it hard to pay rent.  I actually helped her get a new gig as a server with a quick phone call to a buddy.  


We talked about relationships a bit, and she feels things will be unequal since I could provide more for her than she can for me.  She wants to provide for herself and be independent.  I guess she doesnt feel that way right now.  But these problems seem pretty typical for someone her age.


Not sure if I'm developoing One-itis becasuse A. I can help her out B. She's the first white girl I slept with C. She basically wrote me off as a potential LTR D. I'm too lazy to game new women E. all of the above.


If this were a Frye Meme, it would say ""Not sure if i want to pursue this one girl.  Or i'm too lazy to game new ones.""


**They say the most difficult choices we make in life is knowing when to Give up or Try harder.**

I really like her and I want to know if it's one-itis that makes me want to try harder.  Or perhaps I should enjoy my new skills and meet more people?


But damn, i guess having pickup skills presents a whole new set of problems that I never anticipated.  I remember Neil Strauss in the Game decided to pursue the relationship by being vulnerable and letting his inner AFC come out.  Nothing from the GAme worked on the girl he actually watned to b with.  Is the only different b/w an LTR and One-itis, unrequited love?  If so, then I would imagine we would need to pursue it until we know it cant be salvaged. 

would love to hear your thoughts on post game.   Cheers bruvvas!

**TL;DR**
Girl i had sex with is disqualifying me from an LTR because she moved so quickly with me.  Now i like her even more and not sure if i should pursue her or leave it be.

Moreover when it comes to connecting to girls at the party (and other situations) I can't seem to do kino. I don't get it. I am really uncomfortable at it and it does not come naturally. Even in other situations outside of dating, I am hesitant to touch anyone.  

I fear the intimacy. This uncomfortableness is big reason why I don't go to parties or on dates ever.  It does not come naturally to me.  Is there any way I can learn to master kino in a way that teaches me to feel comfortable while doing it.  When I do hug people I usually feel like it is foreign to me.  I got no experience.

Last night I was out with a bunch of friends in a club. I think we had about 12  to 14 people total and the guy to girl ratio is pretty close to 1. The key is... I was dancing/constantly moving when everyone else just stood there. I can't help it when I'm drunk with music, my ankles just bounce around and I go with it.

My buddy knows I have a problem with girls so he keeps trying to introduce me to girls. It's a really nice thought. Combine this with the fact that I dance when everyone else just kinda stood, a few girls in our group were trying to dance with me. The problem is... I'm pushing them away! WTF is wrong with me??? They'd start grinding on me and then I throw my hands up and stop moving. I'll say ""I'm really not good at dancing"".

Keep in mind that I was drunk, so I was probably horny as well. For some reason, I just think that grinding is an awkward movement. Combine that with the fact that I will probably get a boner and it's gonna be sliding up and down the girl's ass crack, adding to the awkwardness. 

In fact, a few weeks ago, this happened... I was at the bar getting a drink, and right when I turn around, I saw my buddy and a girl. Somehow, he convinced the girl to grind on me and I stood there, my back to the bar with the girl was grinding her butt on me. I've got nowhere to go and got a boner in like 30 sec and I'm pretty sure the girl felt it and that was awkward....

I guess I've never really understood what grinding is. My understanding was: You stand behind a girl and your crotch (read: cock) is touching the girl's butt. Yes, I will definitely get a boner from that. Is getting a boner normal, or is my way of grinding considered creepy? Am I doing this right?

I should probably add, I'm from a Muslim country where the majority of the population considers pre-marital sex wrong. I'm not religious like the majority of the country, but that's the culture that I grew up in. Drinking is not as hyped up as it is here in the US.

1339630044.0,15,self.askseddit,v0oy9,"Seddit, your opinions on these two...moral issues.",18,3,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/askseddit/comments/v0oy9/seddit_your_opinions_on_these_twomoral_issues/,"Hi Seddit. I'm an AFC doing my beginner's reading, and while reading this [field report](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/ef5om/fr_big_zit_on_nose_get_in_state_on_fire_5_closes/) I've come across two issues that my morality is having issues resolving. I'd like the opinion of people who find the below justifiable, particular people who have encountered the situations in question. 


1. Last minute resistance, and the breakdown thereof. In the account above, TofuTofu has isolated the girl and made his intentions clear. The girl refutes. At this point Tofu simply chats up girl #2, while making girl #1 watch him and #2 get cozy (kiss-close). This makes girl #1 envious and all of a sudden quite okay with sex in a dirty bathroom. *Is this manipulative as fuck? Does it matter if it is?*

My morality disagrees because whether or not the resistance is weak, it should be treated as the girl's wishes and respected. I don't think anybody should have their insecurities blatantly played with in order to have them compromise their own values...obviously we only have Tofu's word so we have no insight on the mental state of the girl after she realizes what just happened to her. If she realizes what happened to her. Does this haunt anyone?


2. stealing girls right in front of their boyfriends. In the exact same situation, girl #2 actually brought her boyfriend over to meet Tofu. Tofu's response to that is to put hands all over the girl and part ways with a kiss. You see the same situation in the opening chapter of The Game.

My morality disagrees with this because it seems like this is adding a lot of potential misery to the boyfriend's (and maybe the girl's) life. Imagine, you're an AFC and by luck you have stumbled onto a special girl you're quite taken with. Then some guy waltzes in out of nowhere, builds more attraction with your girlfriend in five minutes than you've managed in a week, before leaving with a kiss and her phone number. Maybe it's no big deal for those who've left one-itis behind, but it seems like the great majority of...humanity would have its night, its week or month **completely ruined** by someone pulling a move like that. Why is a boyfriend no longer a deterrent? *is it the world's fault that they aren't as ""enlightened"", or don't share your value system?* 


I understand that everybody has a different moral code, and what I find disconcerting behavior may not be for the next person. But the two situations were picked out because of their presence in what Seddit evidently considers an *exemplary* account of ""what should happen when everything goes right"", gives me and presumably many other outsiders, female and male, considerable discomfort with what this community seems to be okay with in order to get in a girl's pants.

I'm compassionate. I hate seeing people in pain; physical or emotional. I often go out of my way to help those in need if they cross my path. I don't do it because I want a reward or anything out of it. I do it because I believe it's the right thing to do. It's just in my bones. I can't turn it off.

I have convictions, and I stand up for them when they're  threatened, but unless It's a blatant display of disrespect or a complete disregard for my feelings, I tend to let things go; too much drama is started over inconsequential bullshit. I don't need or want to deal with that.

As you can tell, this has potential to have cause issues in my love life. I don't feel as if I'm a doormat; I don't do what I do to out of some misguided sense of building attraction. It doesn't matter if you're a bum on the street or a love interest, or if anyone is with me or not. If you have a need I can meet, I want to meet it. Suffering doesn't discriminate, so neither should compassion.

I'm not bitter over failed attempts; some of them have turned out to be awesome friends that were there for me when I needed them, but it can be really frustrating sometimes to get shot down because I didn't have that ""edge"" that they were looking for or something.

Recently I've met a girl who's really awesome, and we connect so well. I really think we could make a hell of a team if we gave it a shot, and I'm pretty sure she feels the same way. She's gone through some rough shit. I don't know all the details, but she's given me the tl;dr version  and I shared some advice about life I've learned over the years about dealing with adversity. We mostly just bullshit and talk about our interests and relationship wants/needs.

She's also really new to the area and doesn't know many other people. I'm not really content with being ""just friends"" with her, but I also don't want to drop off the radar and color her perceptions of men or life in general if things don't work out. 



TL;DR

I believe in leaving people better than when I found them. If I'm in a position to help, I'll do so. I stand up for my convictions and principles, but tend to let things go because it's not really worth the fight most of the time. Met a girl who's had a rough go of it, and I really like her and we connect very well. Trying to be true to my convictions of helping others without blowing my chances.

Alright guys, I really need some help here. Here it goes... I have the worst case of Oneitis imaginable. Brief history: I get attached to people far too easily. I fell for this one girl about 2 years ago in high school (I was a senior, she was a sophomore (she went to another school)). Long story short, she led me on for two years, dragging me through shit the whole time. What I mean by that is she’s led me on time and time again. She's been dating a kid for about a year now. Whenever she sees me she texts me saying something along the lines of, ""omgg caseofoneitis, whenever I see you I always fall for you all over again. Why do you do this to me? It doesn’t make sense for me to still like you but I just can’t get over you.  There’s something between us.” Then she proceeds to say we need to hang out and we never do. Cease communication some 2 months later, rinse then repeat a few months later. I KNOW I need to stop doing this and stop getting hung up on this girl. I just have the most difficult of times meeting girls so I just go back to talking to the girls that treated me like shit in the past. I feel as if that is my only option. Needless to say, I do not have confidence in myself. I’m not even sure I have anywhere near enough respect for myself because if I did I wouldn’t let this happen to me. I'm working on trying to fix both of these but I just am not seeing any improvement. To make matters worse with this girl, her boyfriend cheated on her, they broke up, and she called me up crying about it. I was there for her and then texted her the next day saying, (I really shortened it up here) ‘There’s feelings there for you but if all I’m ever going to be to you is someone you can cry about guys to and nothing more, I’m not gonna be there anymore.’ She responded with some dumb comment avoiding the topic and then she responded later with, “I really don’t know.” I told her to let me know when she figures it out and that was that. I don’t plan on talking to her again until she tells me what she wants.

EDIT: her best friend is convinced that she really does like me but just can't figure out what to do. Not sure if that helped any, but I figured any extra info would be of assistance :/

To all the experts in here, I’m sure you can figure out MULTIPLE things that I’ve done wrong up to this point, but more than anything else I just need help moving on. I really don’t know where to go from here or what to do because like I said, I have a difficult time meeting girls so I just go back to talking to the girls that treated me like shit. 

Thanks for reading, all. If there’s anything else you guys would like to know that could help my cause feel free to ask.

I'm starting to get angry at people (not out loud, just in my head). I get angry/very judgemental at men, and some of my friends, who are with women. I think it's probably because I am jealous. I get jealous at people because they are living a life that I am not.

More worryingly I am getting angry/very judgmental with women. Especially those who obviously very sexual. I'm just thinking they are whores and completely base, lacking any kind of soul or romance. In fact I think that about both men and women, and it angers me. It's like nothing has any meaning to people. But then I think maybe I think that because I want them (the woman that is), and I can't.

""At 8"" she said with a low voice.

""Oh nice, I start at 7:30 so we are good :)"". She just smiled.


Then I felt pretty dumb because I was thinking ""Boy you suck at this"". Luckily, I saw a coworker (she's cute too but she loves her bf to death), she said hi to me and asked random stuff.


When I got up I told her ""Have a great day! :)"" she smiled and said ""Thanks you too :)"".


It went ""ok"" I guess... I was pretty nervous and didn't know how to continue the conversation.

I'd love to hear Seddit's thoughts on this situation. After getting out of a two year live-in relationship and going through a bit of a hermit period, I'm a little rusty with the dating world. Feedback is much appreciated.

By myself at the bar this past Friday, I get talking to this cute girl. She's really cool and we chat for maybe a half hour. I don't ask for her number, she takes my phone, puts it in, and sends herself a message. She said she had to get going (don't remember why, I was a bit intoxicated myself).

We're both musicians and I had mentioned that it's difficult to perform with my work schedule. The next day she texts me asking if I have recordings online. I reply with a link to some music and she invites me to perform at a bar the next day where she hosts music on Sunday afternoons.

I show up and she gives me a big hug. There's a problem with the PA and she can't seem to figure it out. She gets flustered and smily saying that she's ""not normally like this."" For some reason, I find this pretty adorable and my attraction to her kicks up a notch.

I play a short set cause I have to get to work. After I was done she complimented me and asked who wrote a particular song I sang. When I told her I wrote it, she seemed surprised and said that she loved it. She suggested that we have a beer and ""swap stories"" sometime. Another hug and I leave to go to work. I was only there for about 30 minutes. She's been pretty flirty and forward so far and it seems like she's into me.

I text her the next day telling her I'm free the next couple nights after 11pm to get that drink (I realize now that I should have been more specific and suggested a time/place). She says she's going to see her friend play at this bar the next night and invites me.

Last night I go to the bar to meet her. It happens to be really close to my house—excellent dive bar. It's more of a social setting and the music is over when I get there. This is cool with me. I just moved to this town, so I'm glad to meet her friends.

She introduces me to everyone and stays after her most of her friends leave. Her friends are quite attractive too. We sit at the bar and talk. Things seem to be great, lots of kino, laughter, good conversation, etc. She disappears for a little bit to help her friend who's packing up guitars. I chat with her sister for a while at the bar (also really cool/cute). We get on well too and she laughs at just about everything I say.

The girl comes back and joins me and her sister at the bar. She says a few things that catch my attention— telling me about her house she says ""you'll see it sometime."" She then comments that this wasn't the best setting to talk and get to know each other and even apologizes.

We talk about this cool park that happens to be by her house. It's a huge park and I haven't fully explored it yet. She says, ""We should go there together sometime. I'll show you all the best spots and we can get to know each other."" I tell her that sounds great. There's a pause, then, an addendum, ""as friends, cause I'm in a world of shit right now."" This causes her sister to burst into laughter.

I don't ask her to elaborate— I just say ""alright"" with a grin. I have another beer before she and her sister start to get going since she has to work early the next morning.

We say goodbye and she asks if I want a ride home even though I just mentioned that I live about two blocks away. I accept, but first we drive another one of her drunk friends home to the other side of town. Her, her sister, and I have a good driving sing a long on the way back to my neighborhood where we just were. Fun vibes. She drops me off at my house.

Haven't heard from her today, but I'm thinking about what to do next. The ""as friends"" thing throws me off because she seems pretty into me and keeps inviting me to all this stuff.
I'm hoping she just said that for some bullshit reason like worrying about what her friends thought. In any case, I'm glad I met her and her friends.

I wasn't super into her when we met at the bar originally, just thought she was cute. Now, I'm finding myself increasingly attracted to her.

I saw this more of a date thing so in a sense this could've been seduction... I'm unsure so if I'm wrong someone please correct me.**

I'm seriously unsure on what to do, I think the nerves bested me with this because I declined.  Tell me what you would've done since I have no fucking clue on what to do with this kind of situation.

There was a facebook group message with a gal asking on short notice on a Wednesday to see the Hobbit at a theater on a Friday night @ 11 pm with reasoning about how she can't go earlier due to work.  The group consisted of about 8 - 10 people with about almost half declining respectively.  I checked the entire message feed through emails being sent to me so it doesn't show me seeing the messages... I'm unsure if it did but who knows.  90% of these people are all girls and there was only 2 guys... me and this other guy who I was good friends with in class.  I desperately waited and thought about contacting him about the movie and completely forgot a day afterwards.  By then, he declines with a lame excuse however knowing him he doesn't like movies so it probably disinterested him.

Edit - One of the girls offered others to come to her house for hot chocolate if they would like after the movie around 3 am in the morning, most of them accepted however its most likely open to everyone in the group.

I weighed my options by saying yes or no to this invitation.  This was the first casual invitation I've ever gotten by a group at all this year so I was surprised to be included however I think me and initiator of the get together know each other pretty well and she probably wanted to see what I was like outside of school.

If I said yes, I would be experiencing the first time in my life being the only guy with a group of girls at a movie.  However, since its a movie at a movie theater I don't think its a big deal since majority of it is watching the screen.  Thing is, I don't know these people that well so what can I expect?  It could be a big fun thing for all I know, since usual movie outings with my friends result in us being engaged on the screen since we're avid movie goers.  Saying yes, would be a whole new adventure and outfield plus if I enjoy myself at the hang out, then I may have a chance to be friends with their girl friends opening up doors.  Expanding my social circle.  

If I said no, I would lose all of that. In a sense I would have given up a big opportunity.  I can easily go into my comfort zone and my own universe for all I care.

This made me really stressful for a few hours because I had no idea if I should say yes or no.  In the back of my mind I would have said yes, since it sounds exciting and lots of fun.  However, I was thinking I might inject awkwardness since this is a first time and I'm unsure what will happen.  The nerves could get to me with conversation and I would lose.  I know if its only awkward if you inject awkward, this type of situation was really gratifying though... so I didn't know what to expect.

Overall, in the end I declined and I came out with a good excuse by saying I had family matters to take care of during that day as I could be talking to relatives across the ocean with plans for vacation if ever asked.  However, I completely forgot to add that I would've loved to go at another date with a better notice.

Edit - A random fun fact, I checked to see who saw it and basically everybody saw my message.  I think they were all waiting for my response as I was the last male guy to respond but I should never assume, that thought made me feel important haha.

After typing all of this up... I think I should have just said yes and face my fears.  As life is random and I can't expect is what to happen... my nerves got the best of me declining this.  I guess I answered my own question... 

what would you have done?  Probably say yes and go with it.  
If I did go on this hang out, what kind of advice or tips would you give to me as I'm the only guy with a group of girls there?

* Her: Jst kinda feel weird hanging out at my house, second time hanging outt. Never talk either
* Her: So no.
* Me: we do talk. thought you said you weren't a flake.
* Her: don't know you yetttt. House hangouts too soon
* Me: you gave me your address. you said we could.
* Her: well I thought i'd talk to you all week, but we've talked like twice. not comfortablee
* Me: k. we'll grab coffee instead tm night at x place.

Nothing back.

So, I know I'm falling into her frame in the texts that she sent today. I said her house, she said she's not comfortable. She's pretty like, 'my way or the highway' and it's stupid as fuck. We made plans to hang there and she's botching them. I have a feeling she'll just flake tmrw.

I feel like I should just text her being like, ""tomorrow's not gonna work. sorry."", or something.. because a) I feel like she's gonna flake and b) she said we could hang there and now we can't.

I like to think I'm a guy with a realistic (even cynical) view of people.  But for some reason, I have a huge barrier when it comes to girls with boyfriends.  It's not that it intimidates me--I mean, it does, but whatever, I'm new to this.  That'll pass with practice.

It's more that I think to the one relationship I had that I took seriously  and I know that would have really hurt if she'd cheated on me; I myself resisted fairly aggressive advances on a couple occasions for her.  I honestly don't think she would have--even though we're broken up, I think she's a great person; no bad blood had--but if I know a girl has a boyfriend that she's legitimately happy with, my fledgling inner game shuts off and I have to excuse myself.  

Some girls have fairly casual relationships--nobody wants to sleep alone, and so if you're an attractive and socially competent female, why would you?--and I don't really care about those.  But today I went to grab a coffee after my after-work run, and I started chatting with a cute girl reading The Art of War (couldn't pass that up).  She had a boyfriend, and when I ran a destroyer pattern (awkwardly), she sort of agreed sadly, looked down, and wrang her hands.  It looked like I really made her feel insecure.  

I felt AWFUL.  I immediately cashed in my time constraint and ejected.  I took a 20 minute walk afterward, and I just couldn't get her face out of my head.  It took an hour on my punching bag to finally do it.

So now I'm thinking, is it OK for PUAs to ignore the girls in relationships?  Again, I'm not saying I'm going to immediately eject every time a girl boyfriend shit tests me, but I dunno...I just really don't wanna hurt anyone, make or female; the thing that really sold me on pick up was ""leave someone better than you found them.""  Call it cheesy or AFC thinking.  I'm not here to brag about what a great dude I am; it's more an irrational hang-up than anything.  Point is, it's true and I'm not sure it'll change.  I guess, maybe I don't WANT it too.  I kind of like being a nice guy.

I've been really excited about pickup ever since I found about it like three weeks ago when a friend (who later revealed his PUA status to me when I expressed interest) gave me The Game, and while it's currently more stressful than fun (I'd take two finals weeks over this horrible, horrible AA any day), I think it has the potential to be really good for me.  I've taken up the running and boxing because of it, as well as weightlifting and a new healthier diet.  The way I see it, women--which have, to echo style, always been the area of my life where, so much more than any other, I've always felt like a massive failure--are the best way to motivate me to improve myself.

But is this guilt thing going to be an issue?  I'm concerned that I can't have inner game and be concerned about other people's relationships at the same time.

Before I was with her, I had no problem talking to girls, etc. I actually was able to easily pick up girls for dates (granted it was high school). I have no confidence issues. 

She was my best friend for 7 years, and girlfriend for 4. After we brokeup, I was depressed. I discovered Seddit, and quickly got over it. In class I have no problems partnering with males or females, I make jokes, I tease, I kino with everyone. Always smiling. Problem is, I don't have friends in college. I never really cared, I met people in class, and stuff, but never invited anyone out. I was happy with a close friend + my girlfriend. I have many people I go to eat at the halls with, but I'm not very close with them. My close friend also transferred this year to a different college. I know many girls here who called me to find out if I was okay after the breakup, semi-close friends I guess, (old high school friends) but they're all in their own groups.


Right now, I basically have no real friends. I have people who care, but their social groups are completely different from what I want, and I have trouble enjoying their company. Right now, I go to the gym, study, produce music, sleep, and study more. I spend a lot of time cooking (5'10 220 lbs.. muscular). I don't drink because it amplifies this anxiety problem I have had since I hit my head 2 years ago. My anxiety has given me stomach issues which prevent me from eating then moving too much right after. 

I guess my question is, I feel like everyone has a social circle now. I wasted my college years with this girl, and now I'm all alone. I'm not depressed or anything, but it would be nice to be able to go out, meet people, game without drinking. I have no problem with confidence issues, when I was a freshmen, literally every girl I met and kino'd gave me their number and told me to ""call them"" without me even asking. 

Coming out of this relationship with no real friends who live nearby, how do I meet people? I find it hard without drinking. I love to party (sober), go to concerts (just went to Coachella! (alone...) had a great time), but I can't seem to create anymore bonds as a 3rd year student that doesn't drink.

I have some best friends at other schools, but it's be nice to have one here. Finding a girl is not my priority right now.

So we went to hookah, it was good. We start exchanging drunk stories and I got her laughing with mine. We even started to talk about past hookups/relationships which was just a whatever moment.

During the date something put out red flags for me, apparently she had friends in the area, asked them to stop by, asked me if I had a problem with it, I said no. She told me that they asked if they would be intruding, she then said ""No of course not!"" I mean they didn't come so it wasn't a big deal.

Anyway, throughout the date I was kinoing her like crazy. Hand on shoulder, hand on her leg, our legs were touching, put my arm around her shoulders when we were walking (though I hate that shit, feels awkward as hell for me when my hand is just dangling, especially when walking). But I just couldn't really read her. We just ended up having a good time even though I didn't try to go in for a k-close just because I wasn't getting anything from her in terms of reciprocity.

I'd like your advice on what I can do next time. I'm pretty sure she likes me but I really can't be positive, especially after today. And I have a small oneitis here, which is pretty bad.

I recently had a positive first date with a girl I met online. I'm not too familiar with online dating in general, but she seemed cute enough that I agreed to meet her for happy hour. After getting over the initial awkwardness of the situation in general, we both had fun. Lots of laughing, and she was about to order a 4th round before I had to leave for dinner plans. I walked to the train with her and we made plans to get dinner for this weeekend.

Also, over the course of texting back and forth the last few days, we discovered we both have this wednesday off, so we're going to check out a new museum exhibit and get lunch somewhere.

My goal is to at least k-close after dinner Saturday, and hopefully get over the initial kino barriers during lunch this week. The question I have is... what are some good ways I can escalate the kino organically so that it never feels like I'm suddenly invading her space/making her uncomfortable?

Usually, I would have handled this during happy hour, since sitting side by side at a bar usually leaves plenty of opportunity for kino. Unfortunately, the place we met up was super crowded so we had to settle for a booth. Lots of space between us. She gave me a goodbye hug before I got on the train, but there wasn't much else.

I've always had trouble with the initial kino -- making the transition from sort of friendly strangers keeping their space to comfortable hand-holding/kissing/etc. Once I get over that initial leap, I don't have any issues. I think the main problem is I keep overthinking -when- I should be making these escalations, and I never have a strategy for what I'm going to do.

So, to summarize:

Circumstances were kind of odd though. We were hanging out in a semi public place. She was basically doing a cocky funny routine talking about how awesome she was trying to bring me down/neg me. Also jokingly mentioning how I'm just finding excuses to be with her/touch her ect. I responded the exact same way. This lasted for 30-45 minutes. Never got mad or emotional, simply maintained strong eye contact and did the same routine back. Reflected and deflected any insults towards me. She was laughing the whole time and saying I was funny. The whole time physically she was getting closer, touching me, I was reciprocating. Touched her face, head, hair, hands, ect. Her body language was implying she was into me in a very obvious manner but her words were doing the opposite. Eventually she was making kissy faces showing me how the proper way to pout. Whole time right in front of her face. Eventually went the kiss. Did it a couple times when she made the face. Did this in front of her siblings and other people. No resistance what so ever. Obviously she's into me but can anyone make sense of this situation? Thought it was kind of odd. Felt like she was trying to provoke me to make a move. Almost in a taunting manner. Shes very very attractive. 

**tldr: Words say one thing, body language the opposite.**

I lived a quiet life.  Won't get into a whole story, but know that I didn't have much of a social life.  Imagine me as a kid in a jail (more like mental prison) with minimal social contact.  Think from age of 8ish(maybe earlier?) to early 20s.  

Recent years, I started the effort to self improvement.  I got to say I came a long way...it's like having never gone to school and learn 5-6 years of math from the start in 1 year.  But also I have a long ways to go too.  And I probably would never stop trying to improve after I reached my ultimate goal.  

---
Recent thoughts/experiences:

I been meeting couple new people every week.  Being bit more open.  Learning to approach.  So much more other realizations and learned experiences.  Recently I succeeded one of my mini goals of making couple new friends.  Friends I had a say in.  (I usually relied on others to come to me and handle everything)  I chose to hang out with them.  

Now I got a new group of friends.  A group of friends for the first freaking time I actually existed.  I wasn't just a kid in a corner that people felt pity for and invited me in.  I find it funny now that I got a group of friends,...they don't seem like my type of group.  

I am finding that I am getting frustrated that I am not finding people I would like as ""close"" friends.  The people I am with now are cool.  Nice, chill friends.  I guess it is also good though that I am learning what I am passionate about and learning what kind of friends I would like.

----

Questions:  

-Is it a usual thing that it takes lot of effort and time to find your type of group?  I was thinking this is usually gotten in school?

-How to be silly?  I know sillyness is a natural thing.  Got to be relaxed.  I find it really difficult to ""let go""  I know I have some sillyness, but feel like it is so...hidden.  Even to myself.  In my most relaxed state...I am more open/talkativeish, but can't find myself to feel the sillyness in me, yet I know it is there.  Anyone know what this is?

-Advice on how to expand meeting others?  

-Keep joining this group for now?  Not my type of group, but I think they are still cool friends to see here and there.  Thought this would be a way to branch on in social groups.  Is this how it usually works?

Is there anyone else that's been through this? Should I suck it up and pretend and be pleasantly surprised when all goes better than expected (and genuinely happy)? Should I go and talk to people in an honest, downer kind of way? Or am I hopeless until I'm not lonely anymore?

Keep in mind that people can spend their lives depressed or in a similar situation, so to say that they need to get that fixed before attaining intimacy can be a lifelong sentence to celibacy (one could talk about Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs as it pertains to this)

1319167084.0,17,self.askseddit,ljid9,"After 8 months of PU, I have gotten almost nowhere. I am officially dedicating myself, heart and soul, to pickup. What do I do?",19,2,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/askseddit/comments/ljid9/after_8_months_of_pu_i_have_gotten_almost_nowhere/,"I have been struggling since getting to uni. I figured when I started game that college would just be a chance for me to live up to my potential. In reality, I just ended up sticking my toe out of my comfort zone rather than charging out and it has been biting me in the ass. Instead of succeeding myself, I got to watch a guy do exactly what I hoped to do; he goes out every thursday, friday, and saturday night, rushed a fraternity, I always see girls going up to hug him, and he hangs out with cool guys, and everyone likes him. He's basically nice to everyone. Except me, and I can't seem to stop comparing where I am to where I want to be. Aside from him, the fact that I have not made a single good friend in my two months here is starting to hurt more than before I started pickup. So here it is, a new dedication to get myself undepressed.

So I'm setting out a plan of all the things that I have to do, and I WILL follow them with the same perseverance that I follow my grades. So, here are some easy-to-digest lists on the topic.

What I have accomplished in the last 8 months:

- I know the right values; be confident, be a leader, kino, etc

- I can have smalltalk with a random stranger

- I am not *always* depressed

- I hold eye contact

- I dress better

My current problems:

1. I don't get out enough because I don't know where to go

2. I can't get past smalltalk

3. I am still constantly comparing myself to that other guy, but not as much as before

4. I have a reputation as being an awkward guy in my dorm

5. Early class on friday morning kills thirsty thursday

What I am doing NOW to fix my problems

- I am swearing off of reddit (except seddit, see next point). I spend too much time browsing on my phone instead of talking to people and it distracts me from studying

- I am strongly restricting reading PUA material. Anything other than the essentials keep me way too much in my head

- I will actually leave my comfort zone

- I am meditating every day to keep my mind as clear as possible

- I am taking the bus from my dorm so that I can talk to people living nearby rather than riding my bike by myself

- I am eating well

- I have a notification on my phone that resets to 3 every day and reduces by 1 every time I tap it to keep track of sets. I MUST get all three sets done by the end of the day

- I am going out every friday (when I don't have a race the next day) and saturday

- I am not allowed to scrape by

- I am taking a ""gradma"" approach to people. (""How are you doing? Tell me about blah! How did &lt;something they like&gt; go?"")

- I am going to text at least one person per week to hang out/get lunch etc

- I am going to be more organized with studying so I can afford an hour or two block for a quick lunch with someone

- **I will never forget how depressed I feel because I fail to act**

I usually don't like these ""dear seddit"" posts, but I need to give myself some accountability, and possibly get some feedback. Here it is seddit, from now on, every waking moment outside of my personal study time is now dedicated to socializing. I need to be on my feet by December.

I guess a little background is needed. I've been seeing this girl occasionally now for maybe a month or so. Because of our busy schedules we've only had about 4 or 5 dates. And since she is graduating and going back to her hometown in New York this semester, I had a feeling she wasn't really looking for anything.

So she is graduating this week and I wanted to hang out with her one last time. So we made dessert, went to dinner, watched a movie at her place, and ate the dessert, and we just hung out on her bed (where I've established some kino). I felt as though it was a pretty good night. Then it was time to go. She walked me to her car. I got her a graduation present (Axe Cop), and I went to hug her.

Here is the part I am worried about. So after I hugged her I was trying to say something to her (I don't even know what) but I couldn't get the words out. This messed with my flow. So there was a bit of a silence followed by me being awkward. I didn't know what to do so I hugged her one more time and as I was going in for the kiss on the lips I quickly changed my mind and went for the cheek (She didn't flinch or anything... or least I don't think so).

Later she calls me saying that I forgot the my sushi. Without thinking I told her she could have it (and I was already home). She told me to keep in touch and that maybe I could meet her parents tomorrow. I told her maybe, since it is her parents after all so... At that point I realized that this could be my second chance! She is giving me a second chance to do it right! But it was too late and we already said goodbye and hung up.

Now that I think about it, I feel as though I may have kind of friend zoned her by kissing her on the cheek or at least making me look beta.

I might see her again before she leaves. I'm thinking about being like ""Let's rewind to last night"" (make rewinding noises to make her laugh). Then be like ""Hey, I hope you had a good time in Maryland. I hope you'll come and visit me."" Then go in for the kiss.

Either way I messed up. Anyway to fix this or perhaps improve?

Edit: Just a thought, could I be thinking way too much into a lot of these things? Like her behavior and what I think she thinks and etc.?

**Update**: So I met her again today, but her parents where there along with another friend. So I couldn't do any of the things that I planned. Which was okay, but I thought I could probably gain something from this opportunity.

So I gave her flowers for her graduation and chatted with her for a little. Then I went over and with the dad, saying how proud he must be and about what he does etc.

It seemed as though she was trying to get my attention by complimenting me on my tie, I quickly thanked her and just continued my conversation with the parents.

After, we walked to our cars, I hugged her, shook hands with the parents and friend and went our separate ways.

I'm fascinated by the fact that this subculture exists, I had no idea. But I have no personal interest in it, I guess I'm what your community might call a ""natural"", but that doesn't really matter. Point is, I'm an outsider, and after going through a ton of threads and digesting all of this, I feel like a lot of you (not all, but maybe most) are being taken advantage of. Or at least, you're being misled on how novel these ideas are. Just today, I read this quote in a thread on seddit:

&gt;Rarely any guy outside of the pickup community will stop a girl in the street and tell her she's pretty. Cold approach in the day is an activity only practiced by those in this community.

The author deleted the account, so I can't credit it to a name, but it was in [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/1h6gqc/i_fundamentally_dont_get_why_its_boldballsy_to/).

Now, if this was just a one-time comment, I would take it with a grain of salt. But I've seen a ton of sentiments just like this all over these subreddits, and they rarely even have downvotes.

Is this seriously what you guys believe? You think regular men aren't walking up to women all day long talking to them ""cold"", calling them pretty, getting their numbers, fucking them that night, the next night, a week later, dating them long term, falling in love, etc? Guys (like me) who have NEVER heard of your ""community""? How do you think people have been ""hooking up"" for centuries?

I really mean no disrespect here, I actually see a lot of people being helped by this stuff, so don't take this as an insult. This isn't some internet tough guy coming to your house, shitting on the floor and calling you nerds. I just genuinely feel after reading pages and pages of threads where these kind of comments are being made left and right, that some of you guys are living in a crazy online bubble here, and buying into some weird ideas from scam artists who want you to believe that these are novel ideas that can only be learned from youtube videos, self-published books and 3-day conferences.

Again, I'm not saying these seduction methods don't work. I'm sure they do. I'm just blown away by this repeated sentiment that these are things ""only practiced by the community"". I've been doing this stuff since I was 13, and I'm pushing 30 in a few years. As I said, I just found these subreddits a week ago, and I ""cold approach"" women almost daily.

This isn't really aimed at everyone here, I realize that. Some of you are well aware that there are plenty of guys getting laid without these techniques.......or more accurately, they're using these techniques but don't see them as such. Point being, I read these threads and watch these youtube videos of guys standing in front of crowds of young men, and it just feels like a hustle. They're teaching you how to run game on women, but in the process they are also running game on you, because they need to justify their own existence. They need to pay their own bills. They may not always explicitly be saying ""nobody outside the community is doing these things"".....but that certainly seems to be the explicit underlying ideology around these subreddits. I can get more quotes.

Lately when I get high, I crawl so far into my head that I start acting weird and doubting everything about myself: my image, my actions, my intellect. When i first started off i thought that it had the opposite effect, like booze which just kills my worries and AA and just lets me do my thing. Quickly though, it became a crutch for me to stop approaching altogether. I begin doubting everything about myself and turn into the biggest chump you'll ever meet. Lately, these doubts have been crossing over into my sober-psyche to where they now affect me 24/7. 

It's gotten to the point where the one girl i've opened all semester is basically throwing herself at me (we were laying in my bed smoking and watching TV and I didn't make a move)but it seems i've convinced myself that I'm no longer even attracted to her. I think I did this out of fear of messing things up or because it seems like she's looking for a LTR, and i don't, at least not with her.  


Normally I experience some AA but once things get rolling i get confident enough to go for a close. 

Example of the shit that's happening to me now: This weekend I smoked a bowl with a friend and went to get food at the dining hall. As we're walking in i had at i believe to be my first panic attack ever. Caused by something about everybody in there noticing that i'm high/acting weird. Then when eating the meal i had this ridiculous notion that people around me were talking and laughing about me and things that i was doing. What made it worse is that the snippets that i could make out were pretty bad if they actually were talking about me. I can't remember anything specific but i do remember they made me feel like shit, as if i had absolutely no idea how to behave in public, and was being ridiculed by EVERYONE for it. This has never happened to me before. 

The actual question: 

excluding the obvious tip that i should  stop smoking (i've cut back a lot already and will continue to do so), how can i get over this?

I am a decent looking guy (27) but a tad socially awkward.  I struggle in the inital stages of attraction.

I also have no problem in maintaining a good relationship(casual or committed) once the ""comfort barrier"" has been broken.  Where the problem lies is in between the two.  

I live with my sister (18) and her good friend (19) is staying with us while she gets back on her feet.  Long story short, the innocent flirting has begun (staying up til 2-3 am talking/joking, texting/snapchat throughout the day, blahblahblah).

1. Where do I go from here? I've never tried to date with this large of an age gap and with her  a)living with us and b) being my sister's good friend, this is a delicate situation that could blow up in my face.

2. I have trouble breaking the touch barrier. Any suggestions for how to not come off creepy or it looking forced?

3. Do I approach my sister first to more or less get her ""blessing""?

We were beginning to really hang out. I will admit I was being over friendly. Kino was strong but I am sure after all of it I came off clingy. I was the one looking for her and budding myself in. She then hit me with that quote. I was caught of guard. I said that's very respectable. I don't know if that was a shit test or her showing she was uninterested. I mean who says that. She is only a sophomore and her career is will start in like three years. Am guessing she was just letting me down easily. I tried one final time to see if she was interested by telling her to sit next to me while we waited for her friend. She didn't want to and said her friend was going to come out soon. Turns out it was a guy. The way she smiled at him broke my heart. This guy was alpha and everything I should have been. He constantly was checking out other girls and even asked her if she thought one of them was attractive. She said no. I could tell he was into her by the flirting he was doing and at one point I grabbed her arm and moved her next to me(cringe yet?). The dude backed off. She is a really friendly person and when she stopped to talk to another guy the alpha dude got annoyed and said hurry your ass up and stop flirting with him. He too felt how attractive this girl was to every man. 

Anyways after that day I felt the most miserable I had ever felt in my life and decided to end the pain. I stopped all communications with her. I finally felt better and even focused on other girls. That's a whole different post.

 A few months past and as am walking towards the library she calls out my name. Me being surprised, turn around and see her running towards me happily. I half way remove my ear buds and smile and wave. I put the ear buds back on and try to back away(I became very bitter at her). I could see it in her face she was really disappointed that I was walking away. Fuck it, I put my ego aside and talked to her. It was a very sympathetic conversation and I may have insulted her a tad bit.  

I thought nothing of it until she started ""coincidentally"" meeting me in the same spot. She would walk me to my destination. I no longer gave her the same affection I showed her before, the hugs of a man in love. I was now just a friend. I could feel her getting a hold of me though. 

The final day of school she expected me to walk her in a certain direction. It was the direction her alpha male friend was at. I could not deal with that anymore. I told her that my class was the other direction and told her ""see ya when I see ya"". She gave out a disappointing ""ohhhh"" and then I walked away.

 We don't have each others phone numbers and would just bump into each other throughout high school and now in college. We shared some history and I would be lying if I said I didn't feel anything for her, but if she really wanted to grab a hold of me she would have. I sent her facebook pms when I was deeply into her. I don't want to be her second choice and in all honesty I would love to crush her heart.

Tl;Dr fuck love.

**SHE NEEDS TO BE INTO YOU.**

Without that one fact, she CAN'T be your perfect girl. No way, no how. There's no possible way she can be your perfect ten if she isn't interested in you. Because your perfect girl? She's going to have all those qualities you look for AND she's going to want to be with you.

So the next time you meet a girl and she fits all those boxes on your checklist, but she's missing that one? Move on, because beyond all of the other items that you can (and should) be willing to look past, that one is absolutely, positively a dealbreaker.

[UPDATE],19,4,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/askseddit/comments/11l7ee/what_should_i_do_if_she_is_not_interested_update/,"I asked [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/askseddit/comments/114izn/what_should_i_do_if_she_is_not_interested/) before about what I should do if she's not interested in me in that way.


And the advice I got was basically ""go away"", take some space to get over her, treat it like a breakup.


I tried doing that without giving her a heads up, but when I ignored her texts, she came to my room thinking I'm asleep to wake me up. Also sometimes she didn't even need to do anything, 30 seconds after I make the ""decision"" to stay away, I would change my mind and text her to meet. It was obviously not working out. I needed her help on this.


So a couple nights ago, I texted her to meet and she invited me over to her house. I finally reached her house, texted her to come outside, she invited me in but I refused and told her I just need to tell her something important and I'll be gone.


Anyways, this is pretty much exactly what I said once I got there.


**Me**: This is probably a terrible idea to tell you this, but I need to do it anyway. I'm gonna get straight to the point. I kind of like you. No, actually, I really really like you. And I know you don't feel that way about me, so I thought ""Hey, it's fine, I'll ignore it and my feelings will go away"" but it's not going away. I'm gonna disappear for a while, I need the space.  
**Her**: Define ""disappear"".  
**Me**: Stop talking and hanging out.  
**Her**: Define ""a while"".  
**Me**: I'm not sure. Actually I'm not sure why I came here at all, I just didn't want to disappear without explaining myself and I didn't want to say this over text. I'm gonna go now, sorry for making you come out in the cold.  


Then I left. The 10 minute walk back was probably the most depressing part. It's a 10 minute walk from her place to mine, but it felt like a lifetime, playing what's going to happen a billion different ways and it never ends good and regretting what I've done already. I lost one of the only two good friends I had. I got lost 500 times on my back, and it's a straight walk home. I kept sitting down on the sidewalk every now and then, trying not to cry. I've liked her ever since I met her, and I played the situation where I tell her I like her in my head so many times, never did I expect I'd be the one walking away.

Basically, I hung out with a girl from class, I tried to make a move and was denied. Started freezing her out and not really giving her much attention. I would say hi and I started sitting with other people in class, trying to meet other girls. The other day I got a false sense of hope that I was building back attraction when she approached me after class and started talking to me about plans for the weekend. 

Anyways, last night I got a call from her around 2:30 asking what I was up to and if she could come stay the night at my place. Mind you, this girl lives 30 minutes away so normally I would assume booty call but I figured this girl got rejected by some dude and now needs a place to stay.

So, I, being the nice guy, throw some clothes on, walk a few blocks to get her, and walk her back to my place. I tease her about it and what not and ask why she didn't just find some random dude to go home with and she responded:
""Believe me, I got lots of offers, but I'm just not that kind of girl.""

She kept talking about how upset she was and said a few times:
""Just put me on the floor, give me a blanket, and I'm good.""

Anyways after we got back to my place, I gave her a change of clothes and told her she can crash in my bed. I went to the bathroom, and when I came out she was on the couch. I told her my bed was warmer but she was like:

""oh but your couch is so comfy.""

Mind you, this girl has already slept in my bed after she denied my first move. Why would she not hop back in?

I sort of knew the night was going to end this way with her, so I passed out in my bed alone. I was somewhat drunk and pissed off so I deleted her from my phone and Facebook. I wanted to kick her out then and there, but realized that was not who I was. I hope deleting her facebook and # wasn't an overreaction, but I'm starting to think it was. Thoughts?

Also, this morning, she left before I even woke up. Yep, she used me for my couch. 

What did I do wrong? In my situation, what would you have done? Just ignored the call? Refused to pick her up? Pressure her more into bed?

I'm thinking of when I see her class next week, approaching her and saying:

""Look, Friday night was bullshit. I'm glad I was able to help you out, but don't expect that treatment ever again. You know I was into you and you still thought it would be okay to call me up just and sleep on my couch and leave in the morning. I thought you were a cool girl when I first met you, but I'm realizing you are just like all the others. Go ahead and lose my number please.""

I thought I was getting better with women thanks to r/seduction and askseddit, but this event really makes me feel like I'm still that nice guy who is always friendzoned. Damn.


UPDATE 10/30:

So just when I thought everything was done with this chick...

We hadn't really spoken since that night I posted her about. I have been talking to other girls, and definitely moved on. 

Well in the class we share, she was selected to give a quick presentation in front of the class. It's not mandatory that she does it as long as someone does it, so she is allowed to switch with someone else. Anyways, I get a text from her this morning:

* Her : Heyy can you do me a little favor?
* Me: Maybe, first you gotta tell me who this is.
* Her: Oh it's HB from *class*
* Her: I was just wondering if you could present for me tomorrow. :)
* Me: haha no.
* Her: Why not?


2 hours later:


* Her: Okay are you mad at me because of that one night when I acted very stupid and irresponsible..cause clearly you deleted my number...if so I'm sorry and I was very embarrassed by it I tried to just forget about it...but it wasn't cool sorry

* Me: I'm not really mad at you but I feel like you only talk to me whenever you need something.


* Her: Oh I'm sorry you feel that way I definitely wouldnt just use someone like that...can you help me understand when have i only talked to you when I needed something?


* Me: I mean we haven't talked for a couple weeks and you just texted me to do your presentation. And last time we talked was so you could crash at my place.



* Her: Well I saw that you posted it on the flickr site(I posted on a group page that I was willing to take someone's presentation)...and I wasn't not talking to you because I was embarrassed that that happened that one night...so sorry.

It's like I directly fall back into AFC mode and instead of escalating hard and making her want me even more I just do ... nothing.

The thing is that I'm kind of shy/introvert, which has made me to have little relationship with women. Just had one girlfriend for a few months, and the rest hasn't been more than kissing few girls. I'm about to be 26. I should add too that I'm open minded and always had curiosity on new things. Also, homosexuality is not for me, I already tried it.

Being without partner hasn't really been a problem, it's just that one has bad days from time to time. The thing is that I'm finishing now university, and most of my friends are already on long-term relationships - which I envy. Good thing, I decided to improve my game. I'm confident that by working on the issue I'll get to be with girls, but the need of sex (it has already been a year since I was with a woman) makes me act kind of desperate over them. I have been somehow able to hide this when I flirt, but I see it as a burden that doesn't allow me to act as I would like to.

So the important, I was weighting up the option of going to hookers from time to time so I am more relaxed when going to get to meet girls. I think that by having sex assured it is more easy to hit on girls and end up knowing interesting women. The money issue could be a problem on the long-term, but also is the consequences of such action. I know that I can't fill my need of love from a hooker, and not really sure on the morality of paying for sex. In my country there are woman selling their body because they need the money, and you do not get to know which ones actually like to work on such job. Also, I feel that no one that knows me should get to know this.

So, which are your thoughts about this? Would you feel ashamed by doing such thing? You may ask me anything, I'm always on a self-exploration mode and this is not my usual reddit account (not going to hide anything, then)! Experiences and recommendations are highly welcomed!!

Basically I've met this group of 5 girl friends in one of my classes and a couple have been calling me a player.  It makes me feel more confident, and I guess I'm starting to display this confidence/alpha mindset because people are starting to notice.  For example, I was walking with the group of 5 in the hospital (where we go to school) and this random guy comes up and says to me that I'm breaking hospital rules, cause I'm only allowed to be with 3 hot girls max.  I started laughing and then brought 2 more that were walking up from behind making it 7, and the guy was speechless.

Then I guess this surge of confidence just made me more outgoing and interesting because I've started realizing more and more random girls eye fucking me on the street and listening/reacting to my conversations with friends on the bus for example.  I seem to be becoming the center of attention without trying which is alpha yes?

Here's the problem: his game is much better than mine. My girlfriend is very receptive to him, and shows more IOI's to him than to me. She thinks he's harmless, claiming ""there's nothing there"", but I'm worried this is a potentially bad situation, because I've seen this pattern before with my best friend and his girlfriend (a PUA ran game on his girlfriend, she showed IOI's, and they started hanging out; after my friend dumped her because of this shady behavior, she got together with that guy almost immediately).

He's got a lot of female friends, and is a natural; he might study game, I'm not sure. I can tell that he is really into her (told us he had a dream about her; his facebook profile is of him and her, even though he has a girlfriend; he talks shit about his girlfriend around us; he is pursuing other girls, so has no qualms about cheating on his girlfriend; in fact, he got with his current girlfriend while she was going out with someone else). He sees my girl's IOI's, and hits on her in front of me.

* DHV: ""I'm good with parents. I'm gonna call your dad by his nickname.""; ""I know rich people worth 70 mil.""; cooked breakfast; etc.
* sexualized conversation: ""Beds are for fucking."" ""I want to go in the RV and make babies.""
* role-play: ""We should go and be groupies.""
* pre-selection: shows off flirty texts with other girls
* makes eye contact with her, to the point where she goes, ""Why are you looking at me like that?""
* false-disqualified himself: ""We're just friends.""
* AMOG-ed me: ""Hey Asian!"", doesn't initiate conversation with me
* girl-codes her, texting her: ""Tell him to shut up.""
* tries to isolate: ""Let's go to the piercings shop.""
* asked her out in front of me: ""Oh come visit me next weekend. We can go check out _____."", ""Let's go to Vegas together""
* kino-escalated: swept her off her feet to take a photo
* built a lot of comfort

Objectively speaking, he's got her in the bag. All he has to do is isolate (he's going to drive over to deliver some of her belongings), get her buying temperature up (which he already knows how to do very well), maybe use a boyfriend destroyer (indirectly make her realize I'm jealous and insecure by asking ""Are you happy with him?"" or by saying ""He seems like a nice guy""), false-disqualify (""I wouldn't want to make you uncomfortable.""), freeze out, and then escalate. I'm guessing that he's still pinging her via text.

Also, my girlfriend shows a lot of compliance with him: he got her to smoke pot, even though she didn't want to; we all drove out to get subway, when he said he wanted it. She shows little compliance with me: wouldn't stay with me to watch a concert and instead wanted to go with him to drink, suggesting I stay by myself; wouldn't take a walk with me; wouldn't slow down when walking with me; wouldn't shower with me; doesn't like me taking pictures of her; wouldn't take a picture with me at the concert; wouldn't go with me to get a hamburger; defends him and says I'm stressing her out, when I say he's hitting on her. When we're hanging out, she initiates more conversations with him, than with me.

I know I'm not supposed to be reactive. I know I'm supposed to just have better game than him. So I've been trying to explain the game to my girlfriend, and why this guy's bad news (basically he has game, he likes her, he has no qualms about gaming her, she's receptive to him, and she's comfortable with him). However, from a sub-communication perspective, this only makes her resent me for limiting her freedom, makes her potentially want to confide in him about my laughable insecurity, makes his ""relative moral standing"" higher, makes his sexuality more believable in the mind of my girlfriend, and makes me look weak/intimidated/insecure/jealous/untrusting/unattractive.

In terms of conversation, I always try to make sure that I hear the other person out fully before I start speaking, particularly because it annoys me so much when others don't reciprocate.

I understand at a surface level that shifting the balance away from (2) and (3) and towards (1) requires the group to perceive you with value. There have been situations when I could just open my mouth slightly and have the whole group tune in, but this is far from consistent. I generally tell a lot of jokes, because I like making people laugh and I feel that being funny shows value. I know this is try-hard and I'm trying to change my mindset, particularly because I've noticed that some people can command attention in a group by seemingly doing nothing.

Good job so far.

Unfortunately, I haven't been able to close one woman. Every time I'm talking to someone I feel her falling into friend mode and it gets stuck there. I have no problem with female friends, I enjoy their company for who they are but that's all I've been able to get. (That said, I have been with women but they were usually just strokes of luck.)

We talked for a bit and she asked me boring questions about myself: like how do I know our mutual friend, where I'm from, etc but I answered her questions very shortly and instead talked about her and ask her what she does and tease her a bit. Then I ask for her number so I can call her and continue the conversation. She shit tests me and tells me she doesn't give her numbers to strangers and tells me to tell about myself first. So I write this short, funny speech about myself ""Ok then, lets get acquainted. I'm Future_Alpha, have a habit of drinking water, never missing breakfast, can be a workholic and plan to go into grad school. Now that you know something about me, I'm disqualified as a stranger. Now tell me more about yourself."" She responds with a similar speech to mine and gives me her number. I text her saying I'll call her when I have some free time. I call her on a Sunday night when I return from camping with fam, and we talk on the phone for a bit and I tell her that I have to go to bed because it's late and I have class early the next morning but we have to continue our convo over coffee on Thursday (today). She accepts and I tell her the time and place where we will meet. 

I don't text her until today, when I text to confirm that the date will happen. She confirms and I feel elated (as I haven't gone on any dates lately and I'm getting all restless). I chill with my friend, he gives me some first date tips and shows me some places around campus that are good for talking to and isolating a girl. 

Eventually comes the time for meeting with the girl. We meet, she turns out to be cute, blonde and petite (I like) and I sit her down on a bunch of steps we talk for a bit and I start doing kino escalation. I touch her hands, look into her eyes (try to as she is turned away and not really looking at me) and tell her, ""you have beautiful hands"". We continue talking for a bit and I bounce her to the isolated location my friend showed me, it was a very romantic location. In the meantime (whilst walking to the new location) I continue my kino escalation by putting my hand on her lower back and guiding her or trying to hold her hand (she rejects). I remain unphased by her rejections. We get to the isolation place, sit down in front of this pool with a fountain and I was feeling playful so I took a bit of water and flicked it at her, expecting her to play along. She didn't. We talked for a bit more and the conversation turned to dance. I told her I know ballroom, tango, salsa and batchata. She told me she knew ballroom, so I challenged her to a dance off so she could show me her movez. We danced a bit, I teased her for being clumsy and not knowing the ""proper moves"" (we know slightly different styles) and then I teach her tango. She loves this and thanks me for it. 

We talked a bit more and I tried going for the kiss fully expecting her to reject, but I wanted to show her I wasn't afraid to go after what I want. After talking some more, she looks at the clock and tells me that we should start moving towards the subway (I only had one hour and it takes like 15 min to walk to the subway from where we were) so I could catch my train home, to get home on time for my mother's anniversary. As we were walking I saw a childs park and invite her to come play, but she refuses and I call her a 'party pooper'. I play at the park for a while, she stands and watches and we talk. Then we finish our walk to the subway and I try to convince her to accompany me and say 'goodbye', but she tells me she doesn't want to go and has business in korea town. I shake my shoulders and leave.

Overcome your fears and take to that girl, try to kiss a girl, try to get her number. If you fail, at least you can say that you tried which is a lot better than regretting the fact that you didn't do anything. I've personally lived in my comfort zone for way too long. Its time to take chances and risks. If I fail, so what life is all about abundance.

So I go over and we end up hooking up and I sleep in her bed and shit. I was kind of thrown off because it was way more intimate than most hookups I've had and considering that I don't know her well at all, it's notable that she treated the hook up in that way. So a few days later, we are both at a meeting for a thing (which is why we were both at the same party), but she ignored me. I didn't go out of my way to talk to her but I didn't ignore her, either. She was so awkward that it was awkwardly obvious on her part. So I leave the meeting thing we're both at and try not to think about it. When I get home I get a fb message from her apologizing for acting so weird. I try to keep fb convos short because I don't like to develop relationships that way. I just say nah it's cool and the convo ends pretty quickly. So a few more days go by and she's at a thing with me again. I talk to her when I have to, but I can't come up with a reason to just go up and say hi (she's above me and very busy and I don't really have a reason to be near her area or talk to her about anything).

Gentlemen, this is long, so I'm apologizing in advance. Sorry boys.

I know I screwed up but I need some Seddit post-game analysis.

TL;DR: Met a girl at Lowes, got her number, went on a date,  1 week later she goes cold.

== Meeting ==

I was working on improving my apartment a few weeks ago and thought it could really use a coat of paint. Now, I know nothing about paint so I headed over to the hardware store. After navigating the store I stumble into the paint department only to find that it's being staffed by a 22 year old HB9. Holy shit, this girl was fucking adorable and I loved her tough girl attitude. She explains I should have my girlfriend or wife here to pick out the color, I explain I'm single. I caught her smirking. After some self deprecation, light humor, I fucking dropped my phone and it skidded underneath these huge pallets of paint. Shit! While she goes to get a yardstick she casually hands me her phone and instructs me, ""Hey, call your phone so we can find it."" After this embarrassing experience, we recover the phone, and she proceeds to tease me about being clumsy for the rest of our interaction. So she helps me pick out some of the basics and is piling things into my hands. Now, I'm completely oblivious to social cues in most situations. Now, I'm aware that this girl was definitely flirting with me but I thought nothing of it at the time. She pulls me aside before I leave because I forgot rollers. It's here I finally grow the balls to suggest, ""Hey, I've already got your number here. Let's hang out sometime."" She agrees and suggests she'd like to get drinks. She explains she has to leave and that's she's 30 minutes over her shift and is going to be late for class. She stayed later to talk with me. Fuck yes! I was on an emotional high for the rest of the day and it made my fuckin' week.

I shot off a text late that evening [Monday] with a ""great meeting you"", something similar from her.

Fast forward to Friday. After she explains she can't make it to a local baseball game I suggested, she immediately tells me when she's free next, suggesting we hang out the following evening. Shwing!

The following day [Saturday] were texting idle chit-chat and I'm trying to figure out what kind of thing to do. I'm getting no good information and it turned out she lives further from me than I thought. Now she suggested a place in between us, I agree.

== The Date ==

We meet up at a small bar and the place is actually a lot of fun. She keeps explaining how she's worried of running into high school friends but I think nothing of it. The conversation was going fine, we're learning about each other. I'm loving everything I learn about her. She's outdoors, hunts with her dad, a dog person, honest, and is unbelievably adorable. I then make the mistake about asking about a tattoo of the number 13 on her arm. She then proceeds to explain, for the next 20 minutes, about her mom's death when she was 13. Fuck, opened an emotional can of worms. Nothing really I could do at that point. I just listened intently and tried to give responses when appropriate. We continued to talk for the next four hours. I kept fighting the feeling that I was bombing. I was getting laughs, she was opening up, talking, people watching (people judging I called it)  but I wasn't getting any kind of flirting back besides to occasional poke of ""hey check out this guy"". I tried to kino with light hand touches, sitting next to her and playful jabs. That seemed to get a okay response but nothing ideal. We finish our drinks and I walk her out to her truck. She proceeds to then stand outside the door of the vehicle and talk with me for another 10 minutes. I know now that she may have been looking to for me to kiss her. Don't get me wrong, I was strongly considering doing so, however the emotional conversation and lack of return flirty return vibes was preventing me from doing so. I didn't. Fuck, was that the right move?

She explained she wanted to do this again. We hug and I kiss her on the cheek. I get a giggle from her.

She texts me when she's home and suggests we hang out again. I agree. I text her on Tuesday about some inside jokes about her dogs, simple shit. When I suggest doing something later that week I get no response. Just nothing. I followed up on Friday with another hangout suggestion and nothing again.

Now I haven't texted because I don't want to convey desperation. I do, however, really want to see this girl again and would like to date her. I really enjoyed her company and built up this idea in my head that a relationship was definitely possible.

Now I'm guessing it's because she found me boring. That's what I thought I was, plain, generic and boring. I'm confused.

Now I know there's a very good chance I'll never see this girl again, but I want to learn all I can from this experience. I don't want to have this happen again.

I've had a girlfriend for two years, we broke up about four years ago (we never dates, it just sort of happened, she did everything). I'm in my mid-twenties, I look okay and I go to the gym regularly. I was not too long ago a bit overweight, but I'm still not fit, but it's not that bad any longer. I'm introverted, usually have big AA if I'm not drunk, and my mind can blank out when I'm with someone I don't know well, I just have no idea what to say (getting better with the help of ""conversation threading"").

I moved to China about a year and a half ago, and since then, whenever I'm out drinking, I pretty often after a couple of drinks try to get numbers from girls without a care in the world as to why or what happens, no AA or anything. Over the last year I've gotten more numbers to girls than I can remember, but the day after I'm never interested in pursuing anyone. I just like to get their numbers, don't know why, just think it's fun approaching and see what happens. I've never took anyone home either this last year (one girl really wanted to once but I got scared and it never happened), and I've never really wanted to either.

Last Friday I was out at a bar with a male friend of mine and his girlfriend. She had a lot of her friends there with her that I had never met before. We had a lot of fun, and after a while I started talking to one of her friends who was really cute, and I basically just said:

**Me:** ""Hi, do you speak English?"" (asked in Chinese)  
**Her:** ""A little, but I'm very bad at it. :D :D"" (answered in English)  
**Me:** ""Do you have a boyfriend?""  
**Her:** ""No!""  
**Me:** ""Then, can I get your number? ;)""  
**Her:** ""Okay.""  

Her English is pretty bad, and my Chinese is worse. She has a good pronunciation, but doesn't know too many words.

The next day I actually texted her so she got my number (I didn't call her right away when I got her number like most people on here say you should do), and she answered sort of enthusiastically. We sent a couple of texts during the day, and the day after I sent this:

**Me:** ""I would like to get to know you. Do you want to grab a coffee tomorrow? :)""  
**Her:** ""I would also like to get to know you, but I'm afraid my English is too bad. T_T""  
**Me:** ""I'm also a bit worried about the ""language barrier"", but we won't know until we try, right? :)""  
**Her:** ""Ha, I think you are right, I am willing to give it a try. :)""  

So the next day (today), we were gonna meet up outside a park, take a walk though the park and sit down to have a coffee (I had already bought coffee from starbucks). She was a bit late, and she couldn't find where we were gonna meet, so I had to go and find her (she told me she waited at place X), and by the time we met it had already started getting dark.

Now I made two big mistakes I think. First, when we met, I tried to give her a hug. She backed out a bit and gave me a sort of ""what?""-smile. I stopped right away and when I asked about it she just brushed it away, sort of like it never happened. I think she understood but just didn't want to hug. Second, when we started heading towards the park, it had gotten a bit dark, and I asked her ""It's getting dark, do you want to go to the coffee shop and have a coffee there or still take a walk in the park?"". I should never have asked her that, right? Just do what I feel would be the best option?

She was weirded out a bit by the question and said it doesn't matter. I almost panicked after a while, because I didn't know if she would find it unpleasant to walk in the dark in the park (there are lights, and a lot of other people there, so no worries, but anyway). I told here we'll go to the coffee shop then, but remembered after a while that I'd already bought coffee and was carrying it around, so I changed my mind and asked again, ""should we go to the park instead? because blablabla I already bought, blabla"", and she was like ""um, okay..."".

After that it went okay I think. No more mistakes. We walked around in the park and drank coffee, and she walked quite close to me, often brushing her arm against mine while walking and all that. She smiled a lot and didn't seem bored at all. She answered with long sentences and wanted to ask a lot of questions as well. It was a bit hard, because of her English, to answer or to ask questions, and we sort of mixed English and Chinese a lot (my Chinese is way worse than her English). She happily talked about her hobbies and what she likes and such.

After a while she said she needed to be home by 8pm, and it was about 7pm at the time. After a while (we just kept walking and talking in the park), I asked if she didn't have to go home, because it was 7.30pm, and she said ""no, it's fine, I can stay a bit longer"", and a while later I asked again, and still she seemed to not *want* to go, so that's good I guess, and a bit later I walked her to the subway and we said our goodbyes. 

Besides the arm-brushing during the walks and her smiling and seeming to have at least a moderately enjoyable time, she gave no IOI. Even when we were to depart, it was more like departing with a friend. It went like this:

**Me:** ""It was nice to see you.""  
**Her:** ""Yeah, it was nice to see you too!""  
**Me:** ""I hope to see you again sometime.""  
**Her:** ""Yeah. :)"" (I'm not sure if she understood or not)  
(She half-turns and waves her hand)  
**Her:** ""Bye!""  

And we depart. I wasn't expecting anything more that that, except maybe dinner if things went extremely well.

A couple of things that I think went okay was:

* She was a bit enthusiastic while texting and accepted my invitation pretty easily,
* Arm-brushing,
* She seemed to enjoy the time,
* She didn't take my get-out-earlier-free-card that I gave her when asking ""do you have to go home?"" and stayed as long as she could.

What went not so okay:

* I tried to give her a hug when we met,
* We had some trouble talking because of the language barrier,
* When departing it was like two friends were departing.

If anyone actually read that wall of text, can you give some insight into what happened and what to do now? Might she have thought that I just wanted to be friends with her? Maybe hard to say, but any tips would be helpful!  


**Update: some texting afterwards**  

**Her:** (~1,5h after she left): ""Thanks for the coffee :)""  
**Me:** ""Thanks for coming! I was very nervous, hope it didn't show too much, heh. :)""  
**Her:** ""Haha, no, who's nervous? It's me! I think I looked so bad, I'm late, got lost, and show my poor oral English skills. Anyway, thanks, I'm very happy today.""  
**Me:** ""Haha, no, it was cute, don't worry about it. I think you did great. :)""  
**Her:** Aha, thank you. :)""

We got a long really well over FB chat, we go out and I feel like we got on pretty damn well. She seemed really flirty and playful (such as making a big deal and demanding I hug her before she leaves for 2 minutes, taking lots of pictures and saying we should go on a date on Thursday (which would be the ""tomorrow"" in the title). I didn't make a move (although she looked at my lips a few times when talking to me, I read that was an IOI somewhere) because I thought she was dating this other guy.

Fast forward to today (she hadn't spoke to me on FB for a few days) and we have this conversation: (copied and pasted from FB so a lot of smileys are missing)

Me:
Hey you, how's life?

Her:
Heeeey

Me:

Her:

Me:

So this dates back to about a year ago. I went on an awesome march break trip and I really started to become alpha. I had been working out and the girls could definitely tell. Before this, I didn't have much confidence or game but I was starting to become really confident to the point where I was cocky with women. In that week alone I hooked up with multiple women and slept with two different girls (I was a virgin before this). When I came back from this trip, girls could definitely tell that I had changed for the better. A lot of them were constantly texting me and really interested.

Flash forward a month or so, a girl that I had been pursuing when I was beta was practically chasing after me. I kept pushing her away saying that I didn't want a girlfriend but she was really hot. I ended up hooking up with her on multiple occasions but finally caved in and asked her to be my girlfriend. This was my first serious girlfriend so I was definitely head over heels for her. I ended up taking her virginity but my game around women went downhill. I cut off most connections with girls that were after me and stopped working out for the most part.

Now back today. I broke up with her 5 months ago and was in a pretty bad state for a few months. I had no game and was definitely nowhere near the game I had before. However, I finally started working out again and working on my game. I've read Tao of Badass and it has definitely stepped up my game. Finally applied it and ending up hooking up with a solid 8.5 the other day. Basically, I just want to make sure that I don't go through all this again because I want to continue to be alpha. I'm pretty new to this so I'm very open to advice. Should I stay away from getting a girlfriend and keep working on my game or is there some sort of balance I can find?

There's this girl I know in my college who recently has been giving me lots of IOI's through text message and in face to face conversation. However, this girl is very anti-touchy towards everyone. She will not hug anyone, even her gay friend. She is very resistant to other forms of kino. For example, she proclaimed ""Why are you reaching over me"" and got very awkward when we were both sitting on a couch and I reached over her to grab her soda on the opposite arm rest. Later when she handed me her phone and our hands touched, she quickly pulled her hand away. Other times when I playfully and briefly touched her shoulder, she pulled away and said ""Why are you touching me?"".

Obviously this all makes it very difficult to escalate kino. Do you guys have any ideas on what to do in order to make her feel more comfortable with touch? 

Some upcoming things between us to help you form ideas: if the weather is nice, this weekend we are going to the beach with some friends. We also have talked about going out to a dance club soon, which she is excited for.

I was thinking of texting her on X-mas and/or New Years, and then not texting again until I was back in town. Or should I wait for her to text? Or should I call? I have no idea. I obviously don't want her to forget about me (although she told me she definitely wouldn't ;) but I also don't want her to think I'm not interested and move on.

Around 3 weeks ago my personality changed completely. I went from AFC to a guy who talks to pretty much every person I encounter.

I lurked a lot for a pretty long time. Say ... 2+ years. Had some phases where I would read some stuff out of boredome nearly every day. So I had a huge theoretical background when i started out sich helpes me a lot.

Well fast forward to last thursday. I went out and met two girls I approached one week earlier on campus. We spent the night together drinking and eventually I ended up in their apartment, we played some stupid game and ate a pizza before everyone went to sleep (they in their rooms, Me on the couch). But since I noticed one of them seemed into me I thought I would give it a shot and went into her room saying something along (It's too cold out there. I'm going to sleep here with you as long as you don't try any things on me).
yada yada we made out and heavy petting ensued but there was still this last tiny bit of lmr and nothing real happened. But we made out for like ... 3 hours with a lot of eye contact etc. Same thing in the morning for another hour or so.

Now the question ... I'm still planning to get laid and already have set a date with her but how do I tell her I'm going to see other women aswell ...

she could have been a victim of sexual abuse (saying 1 in 4 women are
abused), and because I didn't ask her if it's okay to be intimate and
instead was ""dominant and acting in role play"" it turned her off

for my benefit.

never pushed anything, was respectful of her the entire time, took her
out because I cared, said how even the night we did mess around she
has to understand that up to that point she told me what she was into
(said ""dominance""), said we would do it loudly, and was the one to
invite me up with beer and told me to bring a change of clothes. From
my POV, and I'd say nearly every normal person's, that is an
indication of what's to come. And I reiterated that even during it I
did nothing dominant nor role playing, I asked her constantly what she
was okay with and never pushed anything. In fact, we barely did
anything relevant to each other.

I had a great time getting to know co-workers and housemates. I am *living my dream,* and tonight should have been a *fantastic* night, but I STILL can't get past a stupid issue that I thought I could finally put to rest with a whole new setting (stupid me). It is my inability to approach strangers in public. 

Well, obviously I have some ability. But it begins and ends with the kinds of skills you'd want if you were networking. That means:

* I don't understand how to make a comment without turning it into a genuine, polite ""interview"" conversation 

* I don't understand spontaneity: when I try to be spontaneous, it comes off as stupid/harsh, not charming. I love to be around spontaneous conversations but I can only follow, and react to what's being said, I can't lead. I have never told a *great* story, and in general I'm not that memorable, even though I'm totally diplomatic/likable. Am I afraid of being disliked? I think my problem is deeper--I just don't fucking have anything come into my brain to say, that is a particularly interesting, funny or long thought. When I do, it comes out in a rushed, start-with-the-punchline way. I've never been good at group conversation. 

* I fail to set sexual frame; anytime I've tried to do so, I've felt/acted extremely rude and asshole-ish. I end up being cute and cuddly and I don't take charge because I act too brash when I try. It's not fun for me or them.

* I need to get over AA: I look at attractive women and wish they'd give me a ""signal,"" but it's hard for me to even be the first to smile with eye contact. And even when I say something it rarely develops; when they say something back, it's almost never encouraging/fun enough for me to continue enthusiastically. Hence, an interview conversation.

* My sense of humor does not translate. I think I'm being sarcastic, and people think I'm serious. People think I'm awkwardly funny when I think I'm cleverly funny. If I had to guess, I'm socially mis-calibrated, and I like a style of relating that doesn't get the closest friendships. I love both serious and fluff questions, but I can't really turn a serious question into a funny answer without getting confused stares. I think there's no sense of 'in' jokes, or a 'we' mentality, even though I have a great time with people. I've thought I'm being social and ""myself"" and was told later that I'm so quiet. That crushes me. 

* If it helps, I'm an Asian-American; I say this only because I get super self-conscious of this fact whenever I'm around an attractive person (Asian or not), and I feel like I'm not the only one hung up on it. Also, I'm introverted.

* I feel I either laugh too much and come off as beta, or too little and come off as humorless.

After we're done we get back to my room for a smoke and some music. I sit across from her and start coming closer. We joke about her spending a night here sometime (I tell her she can sleep in the bathroom or in the closet or something), she laughs, we have fun.

I tell her it's okay to stay here because it's a ""safe"" environment, as in I  promise I won't make any unwelcome moves on her (naughty smile). As I'm doing this I'm touching her leg and leaning in pretty close. She replies: ""No moves, huh? Then what's that you're doing right now?"", with a smile.

At this point I don't really know how to transition into the kiss so I just kind of take her hands and try to pull her lightly towards me, to which she responds with something along the lines of ""oh no, come on let's not do that.

I went into to the club of having a good time (although I would lying if I said I wasn't trying to practice my non-existant night game). I spent my entire time there basically dancing really badly and just enjoying myself.  

However, although I was dancing *near* some of the cute girls in the group, I never actually danced with them.

Each group were send out to do a group activity. Our group activity was soccer against another group(multiple classes participated). I was pretty quiet for the most part and had a headache which most of the group knew about. Afterwards the whole class got together, we ate and people started leaving. This is where everything started going south. The females in group were leaving in small groups of 2-3. Two female classmates invited me to go with them to take the bus to the trainstation since I told them earlier that I lived far and I agreed and told everyone goodbye.

This is kind of a FR but also I need help with what I can do.

Day 1: Train
Some of you guys may have remembered my post on askseddit, but yeah. I opened with a situational, I asked if I could trade some granola bars for her cheez-its. This was to help kick AA. I didn't get to far, I talked about school and her life. As far as I was concerned my goal was accomplished. I had kicked the AA out of me. Anything else was extra credit.

Day 2: Hot tub
So I meet some new friends and we meet a hot tub. Turns out there are 2 girls there too. I initiate before any convo goes on between me and the girls and say hi my name is bla bla bla. We talk a little about school and I got their names. Unfortunately I had to go meet a friend, but I'm pretty sure I could have gone further. Again, this is to kick AA and I was pretty happy about my results.

Day 3: Swimming Pool
So I'm at this pool with some of my friends. Theres a group of guys/girls there and I find myself really into a redhead. I didn't really want to open her though because I thought maybe one of the guys was her BF so I just let it go. However, one time she did decide to float by me in a floatie chair by herself. Should I have opened then? It seemed like she did it on purpose. In another instance, I opened another woman. However turns out she was MARRIED. she had the rings and everything. Anyway, I didn't know at first so I opened as normal. We talked for quite awhile. Again, an AA kicker.

Day 4:Hot tub
So I was back in the same hot tub as day 2. this time its two different girls. I opened convo with my name and talked about school and other stuff. However, they soon ran off into the pool. Where my friends and I shortly followed. I fear the girl to guy ratio was too high about 5:2. I tried anyway. So after running into the pool they soon ran back to the hot tub. Where almost all my friends proceeded to follow except me and one other. Did I do it right here? I was thinking ""the girls will eventually come back because they want something they can't get and I showed interest and then completely ignored them"" Well they came back like I guessed. (for my reason I couldn't tell you.) We talked some more and socialized. One of the girls shit tested me. I asked what was there opinion on me, one of them replied (the obstacle) ""you seem like a cocky player"" which I responded ""Yea, I play hockey, boxing, swimming, running"" I think I broke that shit test.

I got more in touch with my sexuality and did some soul searching on the type of man I wanted to be when I grew up. I learned how easy it was to physically escalate with girls, and how to kiss them when you want to and she's attracted. But there is a problem.

I have never gotten past making out with a girl. Never had a handjob or a blowjob. I've never had a full close with a girl. It's like I have this roadblock in my mind where I can't just invite a girl out and then fuck her brains out. I see girls who have already had sex as intimidating, and if they knew I was a virgin they would react negatively to my advances. I also see female virgins as too innocent or prudish and want to avoid them as they would get overly attached if we had sex, even though I have no experience in the matter. 

I'd also like to take a minute for blaming society for demonizing sex and teaching abstinence classes to children in middle school. My county is highest in the US for teen pregnancies. That's enough to scare the shit out of me from having sex. They never taught anyone how to use condoms or how to engage in safe sex. It just pisses me off that I was influenced in such a way at a young age to be afraid of something natural.

My friends see me as a confident guy, who tries a little too hard sometimes. They think I have it in me to get laid, but I don't see it. Can you guys help me out here? Has anyone experienced something similar in regards to sex? How did you overcome it?

First of all I have to give my thanks to all of you guys. You’ve changed my life for the better and put me back on track after a muddy relationship and messy break-up. Unfortunately a new situation has popped up which has put me in a state of “what the hell do I do now?”-itis and I need your advice on this. There’s a too long didn’t read at the end of this post if you don’t want to read the backstory.

As most stories begin here I have to start with “there’s this girl”. She’s 19, blonde and has an athletic physique. I personally rate her a 9. Let’s call her Amy for the purpose of this post. I had a crush on Amy a couple of years ago but she already had a boyfriend (with whom she is still together), so she rejected me with the whole “I just want to be friends routine”. Back then, I was quite the beta “nice guy” so of course I accepted. Strangely enough, it worked out much better than how it usually goes. I got over my crush (I somehow got a girlfriend) and we’ve been friends ever since. I would even dare to say that Amy and I are best friends.

So a couple of years pass, me and my ex broke up, I found seddit and the whole seduction community, been working on becoming an authentic person whom women are naturally attracted to, etc. You know the deal.  On Amy’s side though, things haven’t been working out lately. Her boyfriend and she had lots of fights which culminated in him cheating on her. Amy is still in denial about this even though all the evidence points to the contrary. After all that, her boyfriend confessed to Amy that he wanted to “experiment” with other girls. Take a break from the relationship if you will. Amy at first refused and said that if he wanted to “see what else is out there” for a while then she should be allowed the same. He didn’t want that.

So Amy’s relationship has been…rocky for the last couple of months because of this. As of late they’ve finally come to an agreement. They’ll experiment with one other person for one time and then continue their merry little lives together because they love and don’t want to lose each other.

I just received a text from Amy about this and she also told me that she decided that this one person should be me. In her own words it’s because I’m “the one person closest to her whom she would dare to do something like this”. Seeing as I’m still attracted to her, I’m inclined to jump at this opportunity to fuck her. However I can’t really shake this feeling off me that I’m just being used and that there’s going to be some drama bullshit after this. So seddit, what should I do?

I also got The Game on my Kindle and have started that recently.

Since this isn't a typical situation I'm not sure how to approach it. The dates we went on were last November, so it's been quite awhile. She said I was too nice of a guy for her so I moved on but kept her on facebook. I've talked with her maybe 5-6 times since on facebook, just general shooting the shit and catching up. Last night I was doing that same thing and she asked if I wanted to get drinks sometime soon. I told her ""That'd be cool. I'm pretty busy for the next couple of weeks [true statement but exaggerated] but we'll see how it goes."" She told me to let her know.

My original plan was to text her this afternoon with a location and a time for Friday night. Chose a not too divey bar but somewhere with a pool table.

So my confusion comes in here: I'm almost 100% certain she isn't looking to get laid or even to be ""picked up"" since we've been on dates before and she moved on. However this, to me, is indication of interest so I was going to play it warm and not do too much kino past touching her back a little bit and her arms. I already have her number and I'm not looking to kiss close or f close tonight because I need to gauge what she's into.

Ideally this would turn into a short term relationship, but I'm excited to try and use the game that I'm developing to enhance the experience for both of us, because admittedly I was a bumbling shy fool when we dated the first time.

She replied, ""Nope, I'm from here, born and raised. But did you really just say that?"" I smiled and said yep, and she chuckled and said ""dick.""

Later, she came back around and we talked for maybe 20 seconds asking how I came down here from Jersey. The entire time I gave disinterested body language, hand holding my head up like I was bored, but was smiling. I noticed that the bar was only ordering water so I said, ""Hey, I know you're working, but charge me $1 so I can leave you a tip, nobody else is leaving you money."" 

She thought it was real sweet, and told me that was sweet for a Jersey guy. I only left her $2, but it was still the gesture. Later, after the game ended, I went up to her and told her that I appreciated the service. She said ""I appreciate the sweet thing you did"" and she gave me a hug. I said, ""Hey, take that $2 and go buy some Skittles, my treat"" and she laughed. I asked her how my team could rent a room, and she told me and made a funny gesture while doing it. I said, ""Do I need to make that gesture too? &lt;impersonated it&gt;"" she laughed, and said absolutely.

I went to the bathroom, came back and noticed she was by herself. So I went up to her in the room and said, ""So, when are we getting coffee?"" 

She looked COMPLETELY taken back, not in a bad way, just surprised. She said, ""You don't even know my name yet, I think that is first."" So she told me her name was ""Dick"" (but laughed, so didi ), and she told me her real name. I gave her my name. I asked what her last name was, she told me, and I asked if she was German. She was, and I said, ""Damn, why am I so awesome?"" she laughed.

So I said, ""But yeah, let's do coffee. When do you want to do it?""  She looked intruiged and said, ""Whenever you're at work"" (I work five feet from where she does), so I said, ""You don't get many people asking you this do you?"" She said she didn't and most people just say ""We're going out"" nothing like what I said. So I took out my phone, put a dial pad on the screen, and handed it to her. She said, ""Man, I ilke your style"" and smiled.

On the way out I told her she could buy me 10 drinks, she said, ""I don't think that's how it works, you have to buy me 7000 before I buy you one"" and I said ""That's not how it works"" and she smiled and said she was just playing. Said, ""Do you see my ass? That is at least 5 drinks"" and she (from what I remember) chuckled.

But yeah, that's it. Thoughts? It's amazing, the hotter the girl the more indifferent you have to be.

For background, I am 34 and only became aware of the seduction world late in life.

Recently, at a party, I started talking to a girl that has a lot of mutual friends and social network even though I think this was the first time I'd actually spoken with her. I was attracted to her, and with my liquid courage I thought I could tell she was attracted, or at least not repelled. I ended up getting her number.

I ended up calling her and arranging to hang out with her in the afternoon a couple of days later. Being in the day time, there was no drinking and not much touching. Nothing you could call ""kino"" or ""escalation"". I wouldn't call it it a ""date"".

Now, my question. She is only 23. I've heard it in various places that women that young don't ""date"", they just hang out and hook up. Is it a good idea to call/text her and arrange a date explicitly calling it out as such?

Obviously directly asking her on a ""date"" makes it clear I am interested in more than just hanging out.

OTOH, she's likely to outright reject a ""date"" if she has even the slightest doubts about wanting a LTR with me, right?

My reading of the cold equations is that a number-close is not good enough and that if I was going to have anything with her there should have been some escalation on the first meeting. Unfortunately I mostly was hanging with a different girl that night and really just kind of interrupted that to talk to this one and get her number.

At this point I was too AFC to go up to her and talk. So my friend and I continue to talk while we notice guys continually failing with this girl and her group of friends.

Don't dance so close to me"" and go right back to it. She is licking my neck shortly after and running my mouth over her boobs. Success. She disappears with her friends and leaves out of nowhere but she'll be back cause it's a small niche dance community.

What an interesting phenomenon, that  attraction builds by way of jealousy. Unbelievably effective. After that, I was a little self conscious (the club is a niche dance club with a small community; everyone knows everyone. Tons of gossip) and embarrassed but then another HB9 opens me and is totally sending IOIs. 

This same girl also saw me at another regular dance club a while back and I made eye contact with her as I had both hands on a girls gigantic fake boobs. lol. Another girl left her partner and came to dance with me out of nowhere; super excited.

We all know it's good to dance with other girls to make the target jealous but this time I was really heavily going at these girls for a good half hour and it worked even better.  Damn, maybe I need to step it up. I tend to just dance with other girls in their presence but never escalate much on the girl I'm using to get to the target.

What are your opinions seddit? Are all HB0-HB10 equally susceptible to this method? I've had it backfire in the HB7 range but effective in the 6 and lower. Now it looks like it is effective towards 9s and 10s. ",,False,,t5_2s7xh,True,,,True,t3_gna5u,http://www.reddit.com/r/askseddit/comments/gna5u/hb9_super_into_me_because_i_manhandled_other/,

Let's say that's the reply/comment you get and she's not saying it in a way that's obviously sarcastic or joking.  What do you say to that?

The story: Her initial reaction was one of exasperation when I did the approach, telling her she was cute and then asking her her name. Asked if she was a student around the city, etc. We were side by side waking and she didn't even look at me when answering and wasn't very audible.  Obvious signs that she's not into it.  So I'm just going to write this off as a bomb.

I then tell her if she doesn't want to talk to me, it's ok (in a way that's calm, wasn't upset about it or anything).  What she says next was something like, ""it's not that; you shouldn't even be doing this, it's weird, you could be a serial killer.""  Meaning of course that strangers shouldn't be talking to each other at all and since I'm a stranger, I could be a serial killer.  I'm fairly new to all of this so this caught me off guard.  Now, keep in mind that we're outside on the sidewalk at 1:30 in the afternoon on a sunny day with loads of people walking around.  

I tell her exactly this - ""So I'm a serial killer out on the sidewalk on a sunny day with loads of people around?""  And she says, yes.  This feeling of frustration that's been building up all this time finally gets to a high and I already know my chance is blown anyway.  So I stupidly talk about how there's this culture of fear she's a part of where a person can't even just talk to another person.  I don't recall exactly what happens right after this but as we approach a corner, at the same time as she's swerving away to turn that corner and I'm walking on straight, I tell her, ""my advice to you is to get over yourself about talking to other people.""  And we both keep walking in our respective directions.

I know, I know. I suck. Hard. Again, I'm fairly new to all this but I guess I'm just an AFC and always will be an AFC.  If I let this get to me then I just feel like there isn't a lot of hope.  But either way, no matter how this might have went, what do you say to a comment like that you shouldn't be doing this, about it being weird and you might be a serial killer, even if you did say all the right things and still ended up with this comment the way she said it (non-jokingly)?",,False,,t5_2s7xh,False,,,True,t3_1c07kl,http://www.reddit.com/r/askseddit/comments/1c07kl/in_a_cold_approach_whats_a_good_response_to_a/,

I'll bump into them around campus, and chat for a bit, and they will always say something like ""Yea, we should definitely hang out sometime"" or ""I'd love to grab drinks with you again"".

One girl for example. We went on a date, had fun, and made out throughout the night but the next day she said she isn't looking for anything serious because she just broke up with her BF. I told her that is fine, I'm always looking for new friends and invited her out with my friends. She declined, saying she would love to, but she is going out of town. I bumped into her again the next day, and without bringing it up, she said ""Hey, I would like to grab drinks with you again, is it okay if I call you when I get back?"" I told her that is fine, but I didn't get the sense that she meant it.

I have been talking to other girls, and I pretty much moved on from this girl. She has my number, if she really wants to see me again, I think she'll call.

I saw her again today, and she came up and talked for a bit. She was about to leave, but came back and said ""Hey, we'll go out again, just I've been really busy"", again, I told her its fine. I'm interested in this girl, but I am not too hopeful she actually wants to see me again, so I didn't take her serious. 

I would like some advice on how to handle this situation. She has expressed interest in hanging out again via words, but her actions haven't reflected that. Should I invite her out again, and see what happens? Or if I run into her again, and she again says we will hang out someday, would I be wrong to be like ""Hey look, I told you I am interested in seeing you again. I invited you out, but you turned down the offer. If you really want to see me again, shoot me a text. If not, quit saying you want to?"" Would this come off too needy, or would this put her in her place and show I'm not going to keep playing her games?

I wanted to share a situation with you, trying to get some inspiring comments on what to do. I felt that there were many ""Get a girl to be interested"" or ""Getting out of friendzone"" talks, so I felt I'd put in something more challenging. I don't need advice, although I'm curious about what you would suggest.

I got to know this girl, who once came to our table months ago with her then-boyfriend in tow, and they just joined our group. She was taken and he never left her side and seemed jealous (she couldn't tell, but my boys could), so she was off limits. Of course, she broke up with him and started enjoying her single life (purely having fun, no dating). Since then she's busy rejecting people (including my friends as a group and some of them trying to advance with her) - Everyone except one female friend and myself.

Since then I found out that she is not sending any signals and believes that guys will take it as a 'no'. She feels like she's getting too much attention.
I do flirt with her, and she doesn't react. She breaks the flow, but she sticks with me, and I don't know why. She often comes to my place, gets late to other appointments because she doesn't feel like leaving. We would just sit at my place and do nothing, maybe talk, have a drink... (She refuses to sleep at my place, she just wants to stay awake the whole night, even if I'm too tired to do that. She says, I can sleep, she will be fine, with dimmed lights and just music... I couldn't believe her.)
One night, we were at my place for SIX HOURS, doing 'nothing' (Edit: She's never bored and even wonders how quickly the time flies by). I tried some kino-ing when the atmosphere was good and, as expected, she didn't react. I could play with and smell her hair, stroke her cheek, rest my head on her arm... Nothing. And her behaviour wouldn't change, she was still smiling, nice, friendly, not cold or resenting at all. She suggested going partying (that was our initial plan anyway, but my place was just so comfortable), so we went and spent another six hours dancing and enjoying ourselves. After that night I tried to kiss her, but, again, nothing. When I stroked her neck and with almost no force tried to pull her face towards mine, I felt slight resistance (if a girl wanted a kiss she'd have moved on her own), so I stopped. I was thinking half the night that I should just do it, but I don't trust those thoughts under alcohol. I feared becoming 'that guy', and destroying this friendship we have (and she cannot seem to have it with any other guy).
It seemed a lot like a date to me. It was the fourth time she spend time with me alone, and she wants to continue. She has no other guys or dates and keeps telling me how every night she goes out sucks, except with me (Edit: She even starts complaining about her moody female friend who used to seem like her bff).

She mentioned wanting to 'bro-zone' me, which seems like a euphemism for friendzoning. I told her I would not fall for that. Since then I keep up flirts, and she keeps liking me, but won't react to anything. She still keeps coming to my place because 'she likes to be funny with me'. Every time I asked her about the attractiveness of someone she said ""[Factor] is nice, but nahhh, not really"". She pointed out some (edit: positive) factors that I *happen* to have.

Another note, I think, while she's doing nothing, she analyzes people thoroughly. Everytime you do something, she stops existing and analyzes you instead of responding. I believe she will never respond to anyone but a crush, should she ever have one.

I'd love to have a more intimate friendship with her (Edit: Even if it's just kissing, I kind of just want to feel her or something), but no relationship. After all, it's only been a few months since she broke up with her guy and I'm not sure she'd be a good match (I guess I don't know her well enough). Maybe it's that - She knows I'm not in for an LTR and wants to wait until I am? I don't feel like I'm being '-zoned' in any way, that confuses me.

Got invited out to a cozy coffee/bar with live music by my married buddy who was there with his wife and one of her friends. Get out there and he wings for me hard. Gets the whole table talking including a cute curly brunette(not wife's friend).

Near the end of the evening after establishing a rapport with this girl(IOIs held gaze, let down hair, playing with hair, lots of smiles) and gently removing an AFC from the interaction, she invites me to help her study for an imminent test. We spend an hour or so with me drilling with her notecards and adding as much flirting into the process without distracting too much from the studying. Sat close and spent the last half hour with our legs touching and some shoulder/arm kino.

Gave her my phone to put in her number and immediately, while grinning at her, texted her my name and a quip/flirt on a term she kept getting blanking on. Didn't k-close, should have offered to walk her home. Next day she texts me to let me know the test went well and she remembered aforementioned term.

I respond with ""Great, had fun and learned some too. We should get together again soon. What are you doing tomorrow night?"" as I already had plans that evening. Got back ""Tomorrow, possibly what did u have in mind"" and responded with ""I'd like to be able to talk without yelling. Lets go to -localbilliardshall- for a drink and some billiards. Will give me something to do with my hands so they don't get me in trouble ;)""

Its been 24 hours with no response, I haven't followed up either. I'd rather crash and burn than just give up but, I don't want to come off as desperate/needy. So how/when do I follow up on this contact?

Current plan is to leave it up to her to follow through on plans tonight and if I hear nothing just go out and have a fun night with other friends.

So I recently attempted my hand at getting out of the friendzone. So let me give you some back story, and maybe one of you can help me out.

I've known this girl for about a year and before reading anything on Seddit I was pretty much an idiot when I first met her. I feel like I instantly got friendzoned and tried too hard. Anyways after the summer break we hadn't seen each other and I started reading Seddit. I started practicing some techniques that I had picked up and honestly got a lot of positive responses. Which brings me to the present.

I recently got a text from her saying ""blah blah blah, oh I'm out with coffee with our friend and he thinks we should date hahaha."" So when I first got this, I instantly thought this was a huge hint. I still do. But when I finally did ask her out I got rejected big time. Saying she didn't want to lead me on and that she didn't want anything more with me right now.


So I guess my question is what do I do from here? Should I just cut her off for awhile with hopes she'll beg to ask me out again? or move on from here and cut her off completely? And if its the latter, I need major motivation.

However, in my experience, I seem to rarely have success when I don't text the girl often (few times a day). For instance, if I only text a girl to handle logistics, then I rarely get a meet up. On the other hand, if I text a girl for a meet up that I have been texting for days, it usually works out well.

So, being a college freshman, is there an age group that reacts differently to texting? ie - does texting work better with the teenagers, but should only be used for logistics on the older crowd here?

The reason I ask, is because I recently met this girl at a party, and she happened to go to the same university as me. I got her number, texted her a day or so after, and we play the response game (she waited 24 hours to respond one time, mostly averages 3-4 hours -- i play along though). I ignore her texts sometimes, she never ignores mine **but I fear that she will loose attraction when I ignore the texts, thinking that Im showing a sign of disinterest.** She never initiates, just me. I am waiting until we go back to set up a meetup which Is why I want to keep myself on the radar, but not come off as needy.

My predicament is that I have lack of friends to party with/hang with. This is because I left my high school (I live in the UK btw, we leave at 16, 16-18 is sixth form/college) and went to study a computer course at a local college.

Anyway, on with the story, there is only one guy who goes out who I'm not very close to (he's on my course, but he goes out in a huge group and most of the time just gets pissed and doesn't even practice game), I've read up on a few books, I'm partly through influence and body language book and I've improved in that department, I certainly read social situations a lot better than I did before (I was always introverted and used to game a lot, was very into esports). 
EDIT: I've also read The Game and gone through the David Wygant mp3's as well as a few other various pickup resources like SimplePickup.

I've read Magic Bullets which helped me understand the process but I've only done 3 cold approachs (1 was a direct try for a number close with a HB6 and another was just a standard conversation, but still an approach, didn't even reach more than 2 lines of conduct, this was because I see her almost every day at the gym. The other was a girl I used to see at college but I only managed to get a few lines of dialogue before she ignored me after going straight direct, I think I waited too long in between replying and maybe should of just asked to hook up with her straight up.) 

So I understand the process in theory, but I just have lack of places to try it out and at the moment I've just been trying to figure out my inner game (partly one of the reasons for going to the gym), I've been meditating and recently went on nofap (but that's not very related, except that it may have sapped a bit of my motivation as you get these up and down feelings, for instance, the first 2 weeks I really wanted to try seduction and now it's not a very strong feeling, but still strong enough to write here.

I'm currently trying to find a job as that'll open up opportunities and next year I'll be going uni which'll throw me directly into the type of situations I want but I'm not a fan of waiting around haha :P
I should also mention, the friends I did make at high school, I've tried once to try and hang out with but they didn't get back to me on that, I think the bond isn't strong enough any more, not really sure how to strengthen it without being awkward. 

My other friend thinks going out isn't ""him"", he's what I used to be like, except, I've been clubbing and absolutely loved it. Nights out tend to be a lot lot better than nights in, you experience more. I've tried to get this across but for some reason he hates me talking about it, he likes to run away from his problems by playing video games I guess.

If I roll up to a club alone and sober, I am an entirely different person than if I'm with a friend or two and have had a few drinks. It's to the point where I question whether or not I have multiple personality disorder.

**State 1:** When I'm in low-energy alone sober mode, I'm very anti-social, depressed (b/c it looks like everyone's having fun except me), and don't give a fuck about any of the strangers around me. I don't attempt to start a conversation because 1. I don't feel like it 2. The fact that it'll sound so forced makes me think that it's bound to fail. Plus it's not like I have a friend to go back to if the interaction fails (to get that validation that there's nothing wrong with me. pathetic, I know). Even if I'm lucky enough to see a pretty girl standing alone, I'll look for any excuse imaginable to avoid approaching her. Then when she leaves, I feel intense regret and am slowly pushed towards mental state 2.

**State 2:** When I'm in drunk w/ friends idgaf mode, I just want to dance, talk to everyone about the randomnest shit, and hit on every pretty girl in the vicinity. Rejection doesn't mean shit to me at this point because I'm having a great time regardless of what any girl/guy might say to me. At this point I can literally just ditch my friends and go hit on large groups of random girls on the street by myself.

Now, after some time, i just cant stop thinking about her, and I know this will bring me down. She likes me, its obvious, and i do like her too, but im afraid this will make me into the guy i always become, some sort of sappy troll that shows too much attention.

We're both young, so shes in a stage were its fine to be romantic sometimes, but still, im afraid of showing too much attention (were both 18 years old) . We havent kissed yet, but we've been damn close to, and she knows i make my moves. Anyways, im wondering:

Should i just tell her i like her, like, make it official? Like, ask her out for a nice dinner?

Also, i left a book in her house, i dont really need it, but im wondering, is calling her and going over for the book a clearly obvious excuse that i want to see her? Should i wait until she mentions the book? I can seriously live a week or two without it, doesnt matter.

Tonight at the train station, I had just left my train and as I'm walking up the stairs to leave the platform, this really cute girl starts descending the same set of stairs but on the other side of the middle rail.  I look at her and I think she takes a look at me but I look away (yet to conquer this as well).  When I get up to the top, I'm debating if I should try something.  It's super late, I'm overworked having just come from the office, I'm tired and didn't get much sleep last night.  So I just don't know.  Plus, she saw me leave the platform and now I'm back again?  Isn't that weird?

But anyway, I went around to a different set of stairs and went down to the platform.. scoped out where she was and saw that she was sitting on a bench but *next to a guy*.  This guy wasn't any competition but it completely discouraged me.  The thought of him hearing me try and pick her up or at least talk to her just made me really self-conscious.  Then I noticed there were two other guys behind the bench who would be within earshot and visual as well.  There was also a few other people sitting on the same bench but with earbuds in so that might've been fine.  

However, the thought of humiliation or being in-the-spotlight with an ""audience"" there witnessing my approach made me hesitate tremendously.  How do you get over this?  Or is it generally suggested that you should do this sort of thing as one-on-one as possible in terms of environment?  I'll usually approach as soon as opportunity arises where there is as few people as possible.  For example, if on the street and there are a bunch of people walking in our direction close by, I'll kind of wait until it dissipates.  Perhaps this is all in my head but if anything, it might be practical too - don't you want to mitigate as much of a distraction or potential interference (however that might work) by others?  

So now I'm sitting here totally fucking regretting not just simply going for it.  The train eventually came and she and the guy next to her both got in the train (separately), and she was gone.  I walked around to the front of the bench and just scoped out how I would have done it, had I went for it, and it actually seemed like it wouldn't have been so bad, even if the guy was there witnessing it since my strategy at that point might have been to come from a place of comfort rather than straight on direct approach; so the guy might not even consider it to be that embarrassing for me or snicker at my loser status having been potentially rejected by her (I'm never too sure of my odds and I'm not batting a great average).  Sucks that I actually care what he or the others might think of me but this is an area that prevents me from doing anything, like tonight.  So yea, the entire way back home until now (and likely tomorrow), I'm going to be obsessing on this and kicking myself repeatedly for not having the guts to just do it.  Fuck.

As for the looking away bit, is it generally suggested to make eye contact right away and not break it?  Or does it come off creepy?

The main question is after a couple paragraphs - skip there if this intro stuff bores you.

So, I'm a 20 year old AFC. At the beginning of this year I had enough of being a lonely virgin and wanted to do something about it. But when I read the guide for recovering AFCs, I realized that before I start trying to get women, I had to get my life in order first.

So I decided to not worry about learning about pickup until after I get my life in order. And for the past 6 months, I've been working on fixing myself up. I'm working on overcoming my depression, I started a bunch of awesome new hobbies, I started eating right, sleeping right, and exercising daily. I still have ways to go, but I'm getting more fit each day. 

I also started working on my crippling social anxiety. I started talking to random people in my lectures, smiling to strangers as I'm walking, making smalltalk, etc. Again, I'm far from where I want to be, but at least I am not a miserable loner locked up in my room anymore.

I was planning on reading about pickup this summer and, with my life now in order, starting approaches etc. in earnest when I get back to school in August, since for summer I'm back at my parents' place and I don't really have much of an opportunity to meet girls my age in this town.

**skip down here if you're bored - here's the main question**

I have an internship at a startup this summer, and two weeks ago a cute intern about my age started work here too. Since I'm no longer completely socially inept, I managed to talk to her and was overall pretty friendly. But I haven't read up on pickup etc., so I've just been treating her as a friend and didn't think more of it.

Last week, one of my coworkers said that this cute intern has apparently been giving me IOIs all week. I've never had any girl interested in me before, so I had no idea what to expect or look for. Even now, I don't know if my coworker is fucking with me or if this really is the case.


I know that the advice is always ""assume attraction and escalate,"" so how do I do that? Do I ask her to lunch? Do I just flat out say that I think she's cute and we should fuck?

I'm fine with getting rejected, and while she's cute and fun to be around, I definitely don't have oneitis for her. I just want to make sure that I make the most of this opportunity, and that I don't fuck this up. Any advice at all would be really appreciated!

We go to a small gig at a bar with one of her favorite bands, she wraps her arms around me as we headbang to the good music and its a blast, she's opening up to me..... another week goes by where she then says she does not want to hookup/makeout/FWB, or any of that and i tell her i would rather have a relationship with her cause im not like that and she says she's not ready for that yet.

Last night we are at her house and she invites 2 friends over ( 1 male 1 female) we go to the pool and she is all flirty with this other guy in the pool and i start to get a little jealous and get a little flustered and it's time for me and her female friend to leave and the guy stays there.

WTF does she want me to do?! do i keep pushing even though she says she does not want to do anything yet? or say F it and move on?

A little bit of quick background on why: 1. I'm in a new city, and having trouble creating a social circle &amp; feeling connected to anyone. 2. I'm very good at being direct and have a track record of becoming ""friends with benefits"" with women in the past, so I'm not worries about that.

I know that creating friendships has to do with a few things: having common interests, values, etc. I'm quite good at creating acquaintances - I have acquaintances all over the new town I'm living in. However, there's no depth here, and no one is hitting *me* up to do anything. On the contrary, I'm hitting these people up to do things socially all the time but not getting a response/getting a no. Every once in a blue moon one of these people will hit me up to do something, when they have literally nothing going on, so clearly I'm an option, and there's little to no investment.

So, the question is, how do I create a connection that gets people to contact me to do something, and has some real intimacy? How do I turn acquaintances into real friends?

Just to be clear: I'm not trying to be friends with everyone I meet, I know that personalities can clash naturally.

I go out, I talk to people, and *sometimes* hit it off... but only with dudes.  When I talk to women, I almost always get the ""wtf"" look.  About 1 in 10 girls actually converse with me, and it's always awkward, embarrassing, and goes nowhere except down the tubes with my self esteem.

I'm a good looking guy, thin, great income, compassionate, intelligent, and am apparently ""the perfect boyfriend"".   However, I have never hooked up with a girl at a bar, club, OkCupid, street, library, school, club, etc.  I have only ever met them through friends.  Now all of my friends are married, I'm single, and I can't get any traction.

I see guys in the PUA community say you just have to keep approaching women until it's no longer an issue.  The more I approach women, the more rejection I take.  That rejection is just making it harder to approach women and not sound like a bumbling fool.  The constant negative feedback from it has led me to the point that if I have to talk to a semi-attractive girl *that I'm not even hitting on* I end up tripping over my own words.

I seriously can not figure out how to approach a girl unless she's in my social circle.  These days, all women in my social circle are very unavailable (married, 10 kids, emotional wrecks).  

So: WTF do I do?  Women are *always* out in their circles and get creeped out when I talk to them.  Every girl I find alone has a boyfriend show up shortly later, or is *extra* uncomfortable that some stranger is talking to them.  Even if I find a guy with single female friends, the guy gets weirded out if I try to make conversation with him.

I'm a 23yr old M and have known my friendzoner (we'll call her C) since we were both 17/18 in very late high school - I've had feelings for C ever since I've known her. She had a boyfriend at the time so being an AFC I just let my feelings lie and gave them up.

We've both had a couple of serious relationships in the last few years but still we connect like no other woman I've met and she does mean so much to me. We've both been there for one another through good and bad times in each other's lives and even though she went away to university she would always want to see me when she was home and still does.

Now, this morning whilst I was blissfully unaware of anything going on (I was fast asleep) C, who I thought was on holiday in Manchester, called on my door (completely unaware of this obviously). When I get up to go to work later on there's a bag hanging from the door handle... I think ""What on earth??...."" Turn's out she hand made me a scarf and left it, with a note in the bag saying she really hopes I like it, when all the time I hadn't the foggiest she was home? (I'm guessing she's had to come home for just a day or so to sort out final travel stuff)

In a weeks time C is off travelling for 2 weeks in India, mainly Mumbai and said that she would like to see me when she gets back. We've basically talked about me going to stay with her for a few days in her house in Birmingham (never spent more than the day together fully, never done anything more than a little very light kino).

So basically, just a 'what do you think?' folks. Reckon there's a chance for me yet?? Or do I accept my fate and not chance the possible destruction of one of the most meaningful friendships I have in my life?

Been friends with an HB7 for the last four years (college). Early in our friendship she showed great interest in me.  I ended up going out with her best friend for 2 years and now after breaking up with the ex the HB7 friend and I are getting close.  We hang out a lot, and are generally very good friends.

Here is my problem:
We have hung out the past couple of nights and ended up getting too fucked up to go home. **So we slept together in the same bed.** The first night we didn't spoon or really touch at all. I was in just underwear and she was in pajamas. Last night (our 2nd night sleeping together) I touched her a lot. She never really backed off too overtly but also she wasn't exactly seeking it out.  I couldn't read her! She slept on my chest sort of, but I could see good friends doing that so I didn't read it as an IOI. Also when at times when we were spooning I very obviously had a boner right on her butt and she didn't back off. But right when things would get heated and I'd try to get closer to make a move, she would back away.  As one last ditch shot I told her she should give me a massage.  She said she never gives or receives massages because massages are gross blah blah blah.  I took this as a major disinterest in getting closer to me and touching more.

Help Seddit. Should I just talk to her? Ask her if she wants to fuck?

Frankly speaking, I am incapable of building attraction/flirting when one on one, or talking in sustained periods of time with a girl, although I can build comfort relatively easily by sharing funny stories about my life etc.

As soon as I logged in, a girl whom I did not spoke to in 3 years (HB8) messaged me. I had met her when I was at one of the lowest point in my life. I still lived at home, worked in a convenience store, was nerdy, underweight and pretty much the definition of beta. A lot changed in the past 3 years. I now have a career in software development, have a brand new car, live in a house with good friends, gained some weight and now are relatively fit and overall much more confident but still a bit beta. In the last few months I went on quite a few dates but I struggle to seal the deal, so I've been lurking on seddit quite a bit. Anyways, here's the story.  

  

So she messages me and we start catching up. Apparently she dumped her boyfriend of 4 years about a month and a half ago. Nice. So I tell her that since she suddenly reappeared after 3 years in the limbs we had to see each other and catch up. She agrees. She even wants to do this now. Mind you it was 10:30pm and I was getting ready for bed. I consult my roommates quickly and they tell me that they will kick my ass if I don't see her tonight. Fair enough. So she comes to my place, I give her a quick tour of the house and we leave for the bar. On the way there she already starts touching my arm while telling me some stories. Confidence level up. 

  

So we get there and I order some drinks. She pays for the first round while I was away withdrawing some cash and she sits at the bar. We start talking and the conversation is great. I start touching her arms and shoulders when it's appropriate. She does not flinch. She also touches me. She then mentions that she started kickboxing. She demonstrates where to hit by touching my ribs. She then demonstrates how to take down somebody by wrapping her leg around mine then grabbing my arms (All of this while sitting on barstools). So at this point I'm pretty confident she digs me. She then mentions that it was the first time she wasn't carded. So I wrap my arm around her and jokingly whisper in her ear to not say that out loud since we were at a 25+ bar and she's 20. Again, she did not flinch. The bar is pretty much empty now so we decide to leave. I wrap my arm around her while walking to my car and tell her I had a good time and that I'm glad she messaged me. She agrees. I drive home.

  

So I get home and start to stress. We get out of the car and she walks to her car. Well I guess she's not coming with me in my bedroom. Fuck. I should not have gave her a tour of the house at the begining. Now would have been a good moment. Anyways, I walk with her to her car. She tells me she had a great time and turns her left cheek. FUCK. I kiss her cheek and hug her. I then start to walk away and she tells me to wait : she cant find her keys in her purse. So I help her with my cellphone and she then goes for a hug? Like she starts to hug me but does not turn her cheek. I think I should have kissed her right then. I still kissed her cheek. Too beta. 

  

Anyways this is where I am seddit. I need advice on where to go on from now. Did I fuck this up at the end? Did I do good? When should I text her? She mentionned she would be busy until saturday hence why she wanted to see me right now.

Anyway since the beginning she would do this, I remained un-reactive so far. I am guessing she is trying to make me jealous, last time I saw her she gave me a hickey which in my opinion is a sign of ownership.

What I'd like to know is should I call her out in a fun way like ""ohhh you're trying to make me jealous, it's so cute"" or just ignore? When does it become too far?

Let's say we go out and she flirts with other guys, I feel this warrants a reaction, am I correct? 

Also, how should I handle guys hitting on her? I've read mixed answers to this: some guys say you should be moderately territorial, some guys say you should try to befriend him, some guys say you should tool him. I feel if I don't do anything, she might think I am weak and not protective of her, If I do the opposite I might come off as jealous/possessive. I always see guys with attractive girlfriends be very territorial, sometimes even aggressive when some guys try to hit on their girl but maybe this is when the relationship is long. I've been on 4 dates over the past 3 weeks with this girl only. 


This is a bit unrelated but how many times per week would be recommended to see her? I am always the one initiating contact and taking her out. Last time I asked her what she did with her week, she said ""I was bored, only stayed at the hostel the whole time"", is she suggesting I should see her more? Something else that bugged me was that she says she enjoys anal sex and did it a lot in the past, when I tried to push for it she said ""I like it but not with you"".

One part of my game that I can't seem to get right is kino. I've got confident body language pretty much covered, am aware of my posture, keep good eye-contact, can open girls, and can keep a conversation flowing naturally, and usually I have no problems #-closing. However, when it gets to touching them, I just can't get my mind around how to do this naturally.

I've been trying to push myself to do it more, and when the circumstances are right I get quite good results (usually much more comfort with the girl, and noticably more physical attraction), but I can't seem to do it consistently, and 9 out of 10 times I can't find the ""in"" on where to get started.

Would anyone be able to point me to some exercises or mental tricks to practice this more ?

I met this really cute girl at a party the other night and we really hit it off, got really drunk got to kissing and I know for a fact I would've closed that night but I was way too drunk and couldn't get it up. But still, it was a nice night, we kissed a lot and spent the night together cuddling, and we also made out the next morning so I know it wasn't just the alcohol. About a week later I asked her to hang out, doing my best to follow the rules and not get ""one-itis"", something that happens to me all too often. So we went on a date, had a nice dinner and saw a movie. I made a point to escalate kino, touching her leg/arm when I say something important, etc. I really felt like we hit it off again, I dropped her off and we kissed goodnight, all is well.

Here comes my problem. The next day I texted and we talked for a bit, she said we should hang out again but ""I'm not looking for anything serious right now""

This is hard for me to decipher. She just got out of a really long relationship with a shitty guy, so I partially understand. However, I don't wanna waste my time.

How should I approach this? I like this girl and would be open to a relationship, but I'm also okay with a casual fling if that's what she wants. Either way, I feel that my next move is the most important. I want to keep her interested without seeming desperate.

I'll start by telling about girl number one, the close friend. We'll call her sally. Me and sally have been friends for a year and a bit, and although there's always been sexual tension between us its only been recently that we've started having feelings for each other. Sally also goes to a different school than I do so she was not at the grad party.

The second girl, whom I met at another grad party two nights ago, really started hitting it off with me. We got comfortable with each other the first night and then last night was just full on drunk make out multiple times throughout the night. I was too drunk to remember the last time I saw her last night but I know the farthest I went was making out.

Now, back to sally. She's a very pretty girl, and is used to getting attention from every guy she meets. Now there's this one charming little fuck that I'll name dickshnozzel that's been talking with sally for the last couple weeks. He's been watching over me all night while I'm with this girl and basically tells sally the play by play all night long. Sally is not happy.

So mid-lecture, I turn to her and ask if she'd like to go get a drink after class. She says sure, we go out on an impromptu date and hit it off great. Here's the kicker:

It just so happened, that her BF of a year dumped her the day before.

So over the next few days we talk over texts, hang out, go for coffee etc. Then Friday night comes along we go for drinks, hang out, and then SHE kisses me at the end of the night. So I know she is interested, or at least has feelings for me. 

That weekend, her ex came to get his stuff, and basically everything just fell apart. She was insanely upset, didn't sleep for almost 2 days apparently, and almost missed a deadline for a paper. The last couple days we have just made small talk over text, but that's about it. I've mentioned getting together for coffee, but she has apparently been busy. 

 Just for the nitty gritty details, I have seen her hang out with other people around campus when she is apparently 'busy'. She has shown little interest in hanging out since. It's been about a week since she kissed me, and even though she still initiates text conversations with me, they don't last long. Also today, when I asked her how her night was last night she decided to tell me basically 'oh I watched some scary movies with (random guy) last night'. 

So, I'm getting a lot of mixed signals here. Things were going amazing for the first week, but then after that one day her break up got real for her or something apparently and it all fell apart. She's doing the whole break up thing (Hair cut, new clothes etc) now too. I mean she stays in contact with me, she was the one who kissed me, but then she turns around and it's like she's trying to get a rise out of me by name dropping. So I'm not sure if she's just scared off, going through a crisis, or is trying to play me. 

I'm wondering what the next course of action with this girl should be. Do I let her go off and do her own thing, do I keep acting how I was acting last week, should I still pursue it but in a less intimate manner, or should I just accept the loss and walk away?

As we were headed out, his lesbian friend called to say she wanted to go out and, since she had a single girlfriend with her I decided to stop being lame and join them.

Well the four of us meet up and right away I can see that the friend is an Alpha HB which I haven't had good enough game to work with (yet), as I've always done better with girls that are more demure. 

I always get the ""you're such a good looking guy"" bit from my friends so I know I'm physically attractive, but I've always felt that something naturally about me makes me extremely un-fuckable to the majority of strong women out there.

The two of us start out talking and any interest I think she might have starts to evaporate because, IMO, the conversation moves to boring areas (she asks what do I do for a living and I give her a straight answer which I think is boring), I don't flirt with her, and she can't keep her goddamn nose out of her cellphone. She's also going through a breakup with her ""ex-ish"" boyfriend that she's meeting tomorrow. She ends up connecting with my guy friend, who is gay, and I actually hit it off with his lesbian friend as we have a lot in common. IOW: no one is getting laid tonight. It's too bad because Alpha chick is into fitness, is hot, sexually experimental, smokes weed and many other things that I look for in a girl.

Later on the Alpha chick leaves and the lesbian friend says she has lots of single girlfriends but wouldn't fix me up with any of them because I'm ""too nice"". I just met her tonight and she already has me pegged this way.

It's an odd way to be insulted, and she wasn't trying to be mean, but it was humiliating to here. I like being who I am, even if that it is a ""nice guy"". I feel like there are right ways to be that person, and DHV... Needless to say I am writing this from a low point right now.

A little background on me: I'm a 22F and I have never had a boyfriend before. I'm a virgin and kind of clueless when it comes to the dating game. I go to the gym every weekday night (I've lost a total of 35 pounds, still chubby but gaining more confidence everyday).

Anyways I always see this guy working out and he is totally my type. The cliche tall, dark, and handsome. I've smiled at him plenty of times and he always smiles back. I haven't noticed if he has a ring on his ring finger (too distracted by his face). I introduced myself last week and he seemed very receptive. He smiled real big and even said it was nice to meet me and we shook hands. Yesterday I tried to engage in conversation again but he was too busy working out but he did mouth ""Hi"" to me at one point. 

He always works out alone but there was one time where there was another woman working out with him. He was helping her with lifting weights/form. I look at him from time to time and at one point I saw her evilly glaring at me. I thought it was funny but I understand that it might be his girlfriend. He wasn't acting like they were a couple however he did leave with her (they weren't walking closely together). I hope she is just a friend. 

My question is where do I go from here? He seems preoccupied by working out or is managing his playlist on his phone. I understand most people just go to the gym to work out. Do I still try to speak with him whenever I can? I want to be able to exchange numbers and/or Facebook profiles with him without seeming desperate. If he is in a relationship then I'd like to be friends (even though I'd like more than that).

WTF?",14,0,44,http://www.reddit.com/r/askseddit/comments/18cfhe/so_im_completely_confused_here_girl_was_super/,"Cold approached this girl and she reciprocated right away.  Totally into me.  Really good flirtation, exchanged numbers.  It was a home run.

Got in touch with her maybe a week later due to having other things to do (ie. spinning plates, etc), and say it was great meeting her, and made a jokey reference to something we talked about.  She gets back to me the next day and asks what I'm up to.  We converse back and forth for just a little bit to make plans - basically, everything is progressing nicely, no major delays in communication.

We meet for our date and it goes *incredibly* well.  We have a lot in common, lots of physical touching and closeness, making out throughout the date; it's a great time.  She even comes back to my place and we make out some more, I finger her, she strokes my cock for a little while, and then of course LMR.  I'm never great with LMR and she was pretty adamant that she had to get up early the next morning and couldn't stay.  So fine.. she says she'll text me and then I ask her which day she won't have have an early morning.  She says Monday.  So I say ok, Sunday should work and I think I remember her more or less agreeing.  Either way, that set it up so that Sunday would be the likely day we'd see each other next (This night was Wednesday).  I have absolutely no reason to worry that I won't see her again since we were so into each other all night.  

Wrong.. I text her an hour later and ask if she got home ok.  No reply.  I text her two days later, Friday, and ask, ""Enjoying the lovely weather?"" - referring of course to the snow storm we had recently, of which Friday was the worst.  No reply.  Sunday, the day we had pretty much more or less set up as the potential day when we'd see each other again, is coming up.  So instead of texting her on Saturday to make those plans concrete, I do it the same day on Sunday (about 11am) because I had already texted her the day before (weather text on Friday) and didn't want to over-text.  So on Sunday, I say, ""Hey, free to hang out tonight?  I remember that you said you had no morning appointment on Monday so Sunday evening should work.""  No reply.  

So what the hell?  What am I supposed to do?  I have no reason to believe at all that she isn't into me.  It makes no sense.  I was thinking of texting later in the week, like Friday, saying something like ""So haven't heard from you in a while, everything ok?  Didn't get hit by a [reference], did you? :)""  [reference] being a humorous reference to something we had chatted about last.  I'm just not getting why she's not getting back.

The funny part is, I have a wonderful girlfriend who is completely head over heels with me, and doesn't show any signs of infidelity or disinterest. In fact, she is way more invested in me than I am to her. This allows me to have a great level of comfort in the relationship (while still seeking to improve my social skills, education, career, and fitness, of course). However, I am tempted to just dump her sometimes and cycle through meaningless sex with a variety of women to quench the thirst of my DNA. I've done that in the past and found it to be a rather empty experience, yet when I'm in a relationship, I do miss it. I suppose the grass is always greener.

I suppose this is more of a rant of what I've been thinking lately, and I do tend to harbor more negative and misognyistic thoughts about women when I gravitate towards these blogs.

But I noticed one thing, right after we made out, she started testing me.

I didn't find anything better than slapping her ass and telling her ""I'm going to show you what being manly is all about!"" but in hindsight, I should have pulled in the OTHER chicks and tell them ""For real girls, you can't even imagine how much fun i have here!"" in a squeaky stupid voice or something.

Well, a week has passed and we exchanged a couple text, and I asked her out for tomorrow evening. She accepted! And, in text, she told me to bring her flowers.

Is she testing me? I don't think I should bring her an huge roses bush or whatever but.... maybe a hyacintus bulb could make? Not costly, they are flowering now over here, and they have a wonderful smell... maybe I could tell her that everytime she smell it she will remember me (CHEESY AS FUARK?).

Or I could bring some flowers, and use it as plausible deniability to get in her house and settle 'em down in a pot so they don't get ruined by the evening, and have easier access to her house later in the evening.

I called this one girl, talked for maybe 20 minutes on the phone. Went awesome. Joked around, we have names for eachother, the overall vibe is great. I texted her the next day being like, ""Let's get together this Saturday!"", she said ""well Saturday I'm going to a basketball game"". I texted an hour later saying, ""well, my buddy just called me and I'm going out with him Saturday so Friday could work!"", and no text back. The week went by and even though I wanted to text her so badly, I didn't. I feel like she's holding the power, and that's how I felt when I wanted to contact her again.

So, my question is, what behavioral changes can I make to have women more prone to chasing me? How do I hold the power?

Also, if a girl has gone cold - how do you get that power back?

In high school, a tough time for me. I've never thought of myself as someone who will get a girlfriend in high school. Always thought I wasn't what the ladies like.

Well I got moved behind a girl who at my age would be considered a HB8 or 9 (don't get creepy on me). She's started talking to me in the past 1-2 weeks, though we have never had a full on conversation. She has been giving me some of [these](http://seddit.wikidot.com/indicator-of-interest) signs, but none of the ones I can make a real move on.

Anyways when she talks to me, instead of giving a direct answer, she'll start explaining it in more detail. Telling me something that can be answered in 3 seconds in 10. This may seem weird but I need tips on how to seem interested in what she is saying while she is babbling on. In that, I mean it's difficult to make eye contact with someone that keeps talking and I'm not saying much back. Yeah Kinda of weird question...

The other question is, how do I make myself seem interesting? How can I make her get past the looks and like me for who I am(Have mild acne, though clearing up)? Also how can I initiate kino if she is sitting in front of me?

At one point in the night I saw she looked a little frumpy, so I told her, ""you don't look like you're having fun, let's dance."" She happily accepted, so I grabbed her hand and led her to the dance floor. We danced a little, but she wasn't too into it. I asked her what was going on.

Her: *I just had a shitty day.*

Me: *Why?*

Her: *Ex boyfriend issues.*

Me: *Oh... that sucks. When did you break up?*

Her: *He dumped me three months ago, but we dated for five years. And we talked today.*

Me: *Well don't let him ruin your night! (Then I changed subjects).*

She seemed to enjoy talking to me and didn't shy away from my kino. She was overall very receptive to everything, but not to the point where she was pursuing me.

In the cab ride back (we were in a group), I had my arm around her and she was snuggling up on me. We were chatting and I made her laugh a lot, but the mood just wasn't right for a kiss. 

So I grabbed her phone, put my number in it. Texted back and forth a few flirty, funny lines before I went to bed so she had my number and that's it.

I need to know what's up with this boyfriend stuff. During our brief convo about it, she seemed really bummed and still attached to him. I don't really know where to go from here, because usually I have much clearer signals on which to base my actions. What do I do?

**EDIT: Texted her and we had a bit of a playful conversation. Figured I'd ask. So I asked her to get coffee with me (she's a student, so I figured it was appropriate) and she declined. She said she was ""too messed up"" with the ex-bf stuff. So she was either letting me down easy or being honest. Either way, I asked, got shot down, and handled it like a pro.

I've realized/known that I'm reluctant to have a relationship with anyone I see as ""unworthy"". I've only had a few encounters with individuals who truly captivated me, and I'd sooner savor their friendships than a fleeting sexual encounter.

She's *that* girl.  The one I may have always had a chance with, even when I didn't know it.  Her and I were friends before I gained any self-confidence, and when I did develop it, there was always something in the way of us dating.  At the end of our senior year, I kinda asked her out, but never followed up (stupid, I know...) and she ended up dating a mutual friend for like a year.  When her and that friend broke up, I asked her out to coffee; she said yes.  However, when I followed up, she never responded and I just gave up.



That was about a year ago.  Now, we're 3 years into college, and I decided to suck it up and reinitiate contact via Facebook.  I was surprised to see, she seemed genuinely excited to hear from me.  Not falling out of her chair, but more attentive than your average instant messenger.  According to her, she was extremely sick when I called her the first time, and was too embarrassed about flaking on me to ever respond.  As much as I'd like to write her off for that, I've done the same thing, so I can't hold it against her.  Besides, she seemed genuinely excited when I brought up the idea of us getting together.



**Enough background, on to my question:**

1)  *How do I not fuck this up?*

It seems simple enough, but there's clearly a shit-ton of build up here and nerves can be a problem.  What can I do, specifically, to keep the *actual* scope of the situation in check?

2)  *How can I reframe myself as a potential partner?*

(Note:  I'm using the term ""partner"" here very loosely.)

For years, I've been the non-threatening friend.  Looks like I have an opportunity to change that.  What common pitfalls should I avoid?

    Girl's friend: ""No, you, the skinny one."" (meaning me)

There was one we'll call her amy, who I felt was more interested in me but I didn't feel like we'd get along when we first met. her other friend, sarah got my number and texted me first. 

I didn't know them at the time but this is how I'd describe them.

sarah is slightly more outgoing, and seems experienced with guys, and a bit of the girl you have to watch out for because she knows the game..and she'll play you if you keep your guard down, she's very aware of the things i do to an odd level..she's the ""sexy"" bad girl(not my type, but I didn't know it back then)..

amy is more of a quite down to earth girl you can trust, sort of nice and goody girl but she's a bit withheld sometimes..she's the cute chill type..which is definitely my type it's just that sarah was more assertive and texted me up first so i just assumed she was more interested and i hit on her and made my intentions clear.

sarah was more assertive and texted me first so i just assumed she was more interested and i hit on her and just replied to amy when she texted me way later on. I assumed they had a talk about me and one chose...but it seems they didn't.

They ask me to hang out, and we hang out 3 times. I try to give both attn because I know I would want that for me if I was in their shoes.

At first I keep attention on both of them, but by the second and third time it becomes clear who I like and flirt hard with sarah, not knowing she's not my type. I kino pretty hard in front of amy, and we make comments about being couples and being married. we havent been one on one or kissed.

but after meeting them three times i realized the conversations i had were ALL with amy and the whole time we were the ones enjoying our time and clicking while I was just getting sexual with sarah and not really talking. My reaction is [this](http://i.imgur.com/mOfmr.png) and i realize i felt the chemistry with amy...the whole time it was right in my face and i couldn't see it. problem is i feel like amy has sort of backed off now physically and they had some sort of agreement. she still texts me and we talk. i don't feel like sarah would be right for me..because she's a bit of a bad girl...and i'm the type of guy that would get along with amy because we share similar traits.

I want to make the switch to amy, but I feel like it's pretty cemented and I'm not sure how to go about this, despite hinting via text that I do sort of like her much earlier. I'm thinking of just doing a 180 and asking her out. I'm going to assume she's loyal and will either ask her friend or might even say no..hopefully she doesn't say anything to her friend.

tl;dr met two girls, unknowingly went for the bad girl, i find out i get along way better with the good girl but i already have been hitting on bad girl for a long time, in front of her friend good girl. i want to make the switch to the good girl. what do i do.

So I was at the gym today doing my own thing when my friend introduces me to an HB10, down to earth, perfect body, cutest face. We made small talk like where she's from, what she does, interview questions and whatnot. Somehow we got into talking about what kind of guy she digs and what kind of person she dates, saying how she doesn't date anyone younger than her (I'm 21, she's 26; shit test?). I busted some jokes here and there, gave her shit for stupid shit and she said that I'm a funny guy. We smiled at each other a lot and kept eye contact throughout the conversation. We talked for about an hour.

What makes me kind of confused is that she says shes a good girl, doesn't drink, Christian and all that, but she talks dirty and cusses a lot. I asked her if she wanted to work out together next time around and she responded in this sexual tone, ""Sure, let's 'WORK OUT' together (*wink and a cute little body roll)."" But being beta as fuck, I corrected her by saying, ""No I'm serious, let's actually work out together!""

Few minutes later she said she had to go because it was getting late, getting her number slipped my mind but she's a mutual friend and she goes to the same gym a lot at the same time. We hugged and parted ways.

I'm planning to man up and alpha the shit out of her next time I see her. Honestly, I don't really want to date her, I want to get in her pants.

What could I have done better? What should I do the next time I see her?

UPDATE:
I saw her again at the gym. This time we got into pretty deep conversations about our personal lives and realized that we had a lot in common and that we can relate to one another. From time to time, I would throw her cheesy flirty lines but she laughed it off and didn't really reciprocate. She told me not to think about it too much and that she ""doesn't date guys younger than me"". She was also constantly reminding me that I should stop trying every time I'd say something flirty. But other than that, we still had a great connection throughout the whole interaction for about and hour and a half. She even massaged my legs and stretched me out!

Recently, I'd been curious about a guy at work. We'd talked only a small amount between shifts, but it was always pretty positive and he did encouraging things like always facing me while talking and stopping to say hello when he didn't have to. Nothing to write home to the parents about, but I felt like he was warming up to me.

I didn't end up seeing him for about a week or so, and then I decided I should just suck it up and ask him if he wants to hang out.

We were both getting off work, but I know that if I had been my usual warm self it would have gone better.

On at least one occasion she tried to cockblock me on the dance floor, always trying to hold hands, blah blah.

We stayed out and partied together all night, I dance w/ and kino all of them (not Karen) and had a particularly enjoyable walk and talk home.  Since it was such a long walk we would split into little groups to talk more, it helped me build more rapport w/ each of the girls. The conversation would always start light and would then turn to each one of them asking about ""me and karen."" 

Seems Karen has targeted me and told her girls that I'm taken. Well, I'm not. I would love to talk to one of her friends, but I don't want to be a turd about it and hurt this girl's feelings.

I've considered joking and amplifying, like (cocky/funny) ""yeah i figured you would want to get to know me before we get married and have kids"", or ""yeah we'll have a candlelit dinner on my yacht, I'll read you some poetry, then we'll head out for some tango and salsa dancing.""

Or I guess I could go with something along the idea of ""Ew of course it's not a date! You're soooooo hideous why would anyone want to date you?"" (But i think for this response, you would need to make it clear that you were not being serious, and that it is a fun response, not a real one. Also, whether this response works could depend a lot on how the HB sees herself, and how insecure she is)

As I understand, having her think it's a date will make her have her guard up and be less relaxed and harder to game, so I don't want her to be thinking it's a date, right?

So how do you guys respond, and why? What do you use to try to disarm this question?

Since I'm moving to school soon, I'm having the opportunity to see many attractive women one last time and (I think) some surprising things are happening. For instance, I was getting my haircut today by my stylist for what may be the last time. She is very pretty, early 20's and very petite. When I came in for my appointment, she had a little bit bigger smile that usual as a greeting. We had our normal conversation (light personal stuff, chit chat) then offhandedly she asks if I was doing anything fun that night. I remember it because she hasn't asked anything like that before. I thought about it and said no. Then I ask if she was doing anything in just a conversational manner and she sighed and said, ""No, not really"" or something like that. 

It wasn't until after I had left it hit me that was a great opportunity. It was like she was practically asking me out. I've had this situation happen before and I always realize what happened after it is too late. My question is how can you be ready for the unexpected? How do you not kick yourself after the fact? Am I making too much out of this encounter? It's frustrating because it feels like (another) missed opportunity.

One had a bf, one flaked out, one I went on a day2 with.  Day2 went alright.  Phoned her last week to set up another date, said she had school work. Texted her last night, no reply.  
I know we didn't have the greatest chemistry or whatever, but fuck, this sucks.
It's one thing getting rejected on an approach, they're rejecting the approach, it's another if it's a follow up date.  And we talked about our lives and shit, pretty in-depth stuff.

1)  32-38 year old lawyer.  pretty girl, talked to her for 25 minutes.  there was a lull and i started looking around some, and she said well ill let you do your rounds.  so i figured that was disinterest on her part probably due to age gap. so i left and didnt reopen. 

2)  26 year old law intern- talked to her for 10 minutes. kinda boring conversation, maybe due to me.  maybe due to her being sober and kinda nerdy.  wasnt that attracted.  so i kinda just left midway thru convo. 

3) 8/10's- i opened with an acquatance and talked for a bit with one and she kinda turned her shoulder towards me a bit  and looked at her friend and my acquatance after 5 minutes. when i combiend this with her being 7ish years older than me, i figured i may as well just bail. so i left.

4)  6/10 party girls- opened and went well for 20 minutes. then kinda faded... as i couldnt sustain, so i walked away.

5)  bulgarian girls- opened went well for 20 mintues but i couldnt tell if it was disinterest or language barrier that was making it harder to talk towards the end of the 20 minutes.

i opened them again later and they were somewhat warm again, but once again i couldnt tell if they were just being friend and not interested or the language barrier was making it a more mild conversation.

6) 6/10 blonde- went well for 20-30  minutes. she went to get a drink and this random guy hit on her and got her number within 4 minutes.

she came back and said ""she was leaving but had a nice time meeting us and hoped to see us around again..."" i feel like this was her possibly trying to get me to ask for number.  i didnt because she was very very borderline on what id do looks wise and the random guy getting her number turned that into a no

7) 6.5/10 country girl- her friend was 250 lbs. the 6.5 was very country so i ejected as im not into country girls unless they are southern.

8)  5/10 at bar- got shot down immediately lol

9) 37 year old- talked to her for 30 minutes and went well. but she was 37 so i just said had fun and left.  felt 0 reason to ask for number. she was very attractive for her age, but i wouldnt make time for someone 10 years older than i am.

10) 8/10 punk rock- talked to her for 10 minutes and she felt like tense. but wouldnt leave lol. so i said id let her get to it with her friend and left.

then i hit on the 37 year old above, i reopened the 8/10 punk rock and she wasnt near as warm, but not rude. so i didnt pursue.

11)  super drunk party girl- got shot down immediately while she danced all over every other guy lol. was kinda confidecne debooster

12)  7/10 30-36 year old ish-  she was at a table with 2 guys who obviously werent dating her. so i went and sat down next to her and talked for 30 minutes and it was a good talk.  so i asked for her number and she said she was kinda seeing someone.

idk if she was legit or not.  idk why she would talk for 30 minutes though if she wasnt single

13)  married puerto rican girl- didnt know she was married.  but she kept talkign to me after i started so i regreted it

14) blonde college girl- instant shut down

15) 7/10 party girl-  walked up to her and started talking and her friend just stared at me like i was raping babies lol. she was friendly but awkward as her friend did not want me there and wasnt friendly when i tried bringign her in the conversation. so i left quite quickly",,False,,t5_2s7xh,1374678530.0,,,True,t3_1iyh6s,http://www.reddit.com/r/askseddit/comments/1iyh6s/made_15_approaches_last_saturday_night_log_of/,

I was a hermit for most of my life. And while my close knit group of friends have tons of friends, I don't have any other friends. Everyone that I have met, I met through my friends. I recently became (?) an extrovert. I try to meet and talk to as many people as I can, I'm not great at it, as I sometimes shut down if I feel like theres no connection, or If I run out of things to say, but I know practice makes perfect.

In an area where everyone knows everyone, there is one girl that I've been fancying in particular. I know of her, she probably has heard of or seen me. She knows a lot of people. ""popular"", if you will. I never thought that concept would pass highschool, but I'm now out of college and realizing it is a thing. When meeting a stranger, I can charm them with conversation and confidence and all that jazz, however when dealing with a girl who knows you somewhat, what are the appropriate steps to take?

At least once a week when we'd see each other. We went on dates, had a great time just hanging out and getting to know each other and the sex was amazing. At the time we started hooking up she had a boyfriend. This was short lived; she broke up with him a couple weeks into our relationship. She really likes me and at the time asked me if I would consider a relationship with her if she were single because she was ""growing genuine feelings for me."" I said I'd be open to the idea. So we hung out some more, had sex, etc. A couple weeks later and more hangouts later I wanted to be on the same page as her as to what we were doing. All the sudden she has a change in heart and doesn't want a relationship and doesn't think she can ""love me the way I deserve to be loved."" Keep in mind she said this before she started pulling away.

She recently moved closer to me for a new career opportunity. In the beginning we'd be texting a lot. Almost hourly. But now the texting is more sporadic. She didn't text me at all for an entire day and apologized the next day saying she was busy and forgot to text me back. But then the next day I texted her with one exchange between us. I asked her a question pertaining to her new job and she didn't respond at all. Which is weird because she said she misses me and can't wait to see me. I told her if she wants to hangout she's going to have to initiate because I've put more effort than I should without results. Her response to this was ""I'll be sure to make it a slam dunk ;-)."" She's incredibly hard to read. 

I'm starting to think she's pulling away, is too much of a coward to address this directly so she's just avoiding me entirely. I feel like I'm over thinking this but I don't know if I should just text her and ask whats going on with the sudden shift in communication. The good news is that I'm not bombarding her with messages. If I sent the last message then I'm not going to send another one until she responds.
Reddit, how do I proceed with this?

This is my first post here, so bear with me.

Long story short, after a long time of being lonely and terrible at dealing with women, I finally managed to pull myself together and found a wonderful girlfriend whom I adore.

My problem is that I'm a virgin. She doesn't know this yet. There is a certain party coming up in a few weeks that might eventually lead to a sleep over, and with the hints she's been giving me, I have a feeling that she might try to initiate sex then. I could be wrong, but the thought makes me nervous.

How would you deal with this situation? Part of me wants to happen, because I really like her, and it's so long overdue. But part of me is nervous and doesn't want it to happen. I keep wondering if it's too soon, or what if I'm terrible at it. Should I even tell her if things start heating up? Would that turn her off?

I am a virgin at 23, and she seems a little afraid of having sex with a virgin. She had no reluctance to making out and giving me handjobs/blowjobs. She even has talked about her giving me head, and how she liked it and probably wants to do it again.

This is what she said to me.

1. I don't know what I'm really getting myself into and that scares her. 

2. Sex is a big thing for her, and my experience might disappoint her. Apparently she used to have really good sex before. Now I feel like this could be true, but it's also some sort of test for me. 

3. She thinks after I have sex with her I'm going to want something ""new"" somwhere down the line. I took that as hitting it and quitting it. 

Now I now she wants to do it. The attraction is still very strong. I was very confident around her, funny, and intelligent which got me her number and multiple dates. I was with her not that long ago, and the way she was looking at me.... my god I couldn't contain myself. 

I just don't know how to escalate farther and put these thoughts out of her head. I definitely think she was testing me a little bit, waiting for me to give her a reason to not have any of those fears she has anymore so that she can finally have sex with me which she has obviously been eager to do. I just don't know how to do so. 


----------------

Update: So I really took what you all had to say into consideration and took it seriously. After a lot of thinking you were all right. 

I told her I wanted to meet up and talk tomorrow in person. She wanted to hear what I had to say over text as in she didn't want to have to ""go through all that"". That there kind of solidified how she really felt about me and what I should do. 

She did ask a lot of question when we first started talking, such as ""do you consider yourself an emotional person? a sexual person? how often do you masturbate? what am I into?"" and so many other questions. Honestly I wasn't sure how to answer them sometimes, it was difficult because I've never discussed things like that before, but I tried and my best for her. That is what I think she meant by ""having to go through all that"" and describing me as frustrating. Idk maybe I am a little bit, but I'm not perfect.

It sucks to walk away, but it's the right thing to do. I do need to find someone who is willing to work with me, and honestly if they are willing to do that then they are worth my time. I might never encounter another HB9 like her again, but at least I tried.

We danced, kissed a lot, whatever. At one point in the night, out of the blue she says to me that she's looking for a guy she can just have sex with, lay in bed, eat icecream and watch movies (her words). She asked me if I was interested and I said yes.

In other words, you'll go months w/o seeing them bc they are off at school or live in other town but occasionally come back.

She seems to want to casually date me, but acts like she wants a relationship in terms of how she's acting and the pace she's moving at. It's utterly confusing to me and I have no idea if our relationship is moving forewords or what she wants.

I went on 3 dates with this girl. First date we had tons of fun and good chemistry and made out, second date we did the same and I tried to initiate more but no dice, we sort of dry humped a little but she wouldn't let me touch her anywhere, she was on top and I felt her..she was very hot down there, and third date she would only kiss me a few times and wouldn't let me do more.

I tried to ask her to watch a movie at her place but she said she didn't like movies. I want to be in a private place together somewhere...

She's quite(but not awkward) and doesn't talk much so sometimes I feel like she might not even like me. I tried to connect with her emotionally and on various levels but it seems nothing is work.

I was kissing her on our third date and after lots of trying...we kissed a few times only, I was confused and felt like she didn't even like me. It made me feel confused. I dropped it and went back to just chatting. 

She tends to hide her motivations and what she feels. I asked her if she wasn't comfortable with kissing or something and she said something along the lines of we could do that later because we're going to see each other again anyway. 

She still wants to go on dates but I feel like the chemistry is dying here since I feel like our relationship isn't moving foreword emotionally or physically, I can't get anything out of this girl in terms of what's going on. 

I have no idea what she wants. I tried asking her if she knew what she was looking for currently, something casual or something else or what and I couldn't get any straight answer out of her. I am attracted to her emotionally and physically.

She's not a virgin and has had a couple of boyfriends and is dating other men. so what's going on?

If the spark isn't there why does she continue to want to spend time with me? if there is why can't I get any answers and why doesn't she let me do anything other than kiss her?

I start talking to a girl with pretty much just a ""hi"" and from there on I try to escalate, and some times I get a good vibe from the girl, she is very responsive, I have her atention etc. But then it comes this other guy who goes all agressive over me, saying things like ""Is there a problem?"" or just showing up and be standing there awkwardly!

I walked up to this pretty girl, I would giver her an 7 (8 as i found out a little about her). I put my bag down, sat in front of her, smiled and said ""I saw you, came over, I am going to get to know you for the next 5 minutes"" I get her name and since we are at Uni, my initial question is to ask what she does.

I have read, that I need to make my intentions clear from the start. I find out that she is not a girly girl, and does Adv Med (1st year).

I make sure I dont turn this into an interview, so I try read her and make statements such as ""You look like a girl who comes form an all girls school"" she laughs and tells me she isn't a girly girl and talks about herself a little bit. She asks what I do, I do 3rd Year Computer Science, and she mentions the typical stereotype, I have this reaction from nearly everyone I meet/talk to so I am used to laughing it off.

(I am going to now just list some thing I picked up on which shows she is enjoying talking to me)

- she mentions she feels rude for talking to me with her sunglasses on, I havent got my pair since they broke the day before, I tell her she can keep them on (maybe i should have allowed her to take them off since having direct eye contact builds a deeper connection)


- I ask the most important question after I have her laughing and maintaining strong eye contact (through her sunnies, i can still see through) - ""Do you have a boyfriend?"" She replies hesitantly, with a dull voice ""Yer... sorta.. but its complicated""  - I remain un-reactive, smile for a bit then turn then I think I successfully change my approach. I mention she is cute and that she may have some cute friends and she could introduce me, immediately she is laughing and I tell her that I should still get her number, she agrees. I dont get the number just yet I continue to have conversation with her about what she likes and tease her for having no friends around for lunch. How should I have escalated if I had the chance??

- she suggest we go and get a free sausage sandwich, we are talking in line, bodies sort of turned into each other while speaking, after we have the sandwich's in hand we go sit down, and continue to talk, here I get her to talk about what she does (work wise, and what she wants to be) and she continues the conversation till the point where she is practically 5 minutes late for a tutorial, I get her number, send her a txt, and we part.

- It seem immediately after her tutorial she messages me and asks if im going to a party at the unibar, I tell her that the week the party is on, I am flooded with assignments (Im clinging onto a D Average, so dont want lose it, I dont obviously tell her my avg mark It is just to give you readers a solid reason why to throw away my hard work for on a girl). She replies ""Haha aw ok then, Another Time!""


What are my options, she is hot, smart and funny. I havent txt her since last tuesday (today being sunday)
I know i screwed up the txt message part cause I left it closed ended. Help me Im a rookie! Sorry for the long post.

I started reading Magic Bullets and it's got good advice and all but my main problem is AA.

I look around for AA posts and think to myself 'Why are there so few posts and so few AA resources in general?'. Then I realise it must be that A-AA is not something someone can teach you, it's something that you just have to do yourself. It really is as simple as walking up to a girl and talking to her. But if it's so simple then why's it so difficult?

I can pump myself up when on the internet and get all the information I need to go and just start approaching, and I read about guys who have no AA and are just all-out brave. Then... when it comes time to approach, I walk past or sit next to a cute girl and!!!!... nothing. I'm just petrified for some reason. I think to myself they're just girls but I find it safer not to approach, don't have to worry about anything bad happening and I can live in my little bubble.

But then after it's all said done I come home and think 'Not approaching is BORING', and it just sets the whole cycle off again.

Don't get me wrong, I know women really aren't important at all and I'm not worried about being foreveralone etc., but they still scare the shit out of me for some reason. I guess it's not them who scare me, it's just the outcome. I'm scared of what'll happen next. Not even if I get rejected, I'm just scared some big fucker of a boyfriend will come up behind me and paralyse me, or she'll slap me, or she'll be real rude and embarrass me.  Because I don't mind about actually getting a girlfriend, rejection doesn't phase me. I'd much rather be able to simply approach and get rejected every time but not get embarrased/physically hurt rather than not approach at all.

I'm going to university after Summer and I think to myself 'It'll be different then', everyone says to me 'It'll be different then'. Nah.. it won't.. not unless I do something about it. Even if a girl starts talking to me I won't be confident enough to carry the conversation.

Don't get me wrong, I'm quite a confident person in body language and speech, I won't shrink back or speak quietly to a stranger, it's just normally having that confidence to do something like approaching brings with it a confidence to think of things to say quicker and make conversations flow. I find it difficult to think of things to say sometimes, not because I'm nervous, just cause I don't have a crap-ton of conversation-ammo in my armory.

I could continually try to pump myself up and try to approach but I know I'll probably be stuck in this cycle forever and I'll never get out of it.

Any advice?

**Background:** Right now there are 3, let's say, HB8's (i.e. they're pretty much equally attractive in my mind) that have shown me IOI's. I have never hooked up with any of them before, but very much plan on doing so.

**HB8 #1:** Knows my roommates well, has mutual friends, has been to our pre-games before, and it wouldn't necessarily mean anything special for me to invite her over. But I would still like to escalate things (and I know she's at least somewhat interested).

**HB8 #2:** Knows my roommates, has mutual friends, but has never been invited to one of these pre-games before. If I asked her to come, it might be weird for me to go hook up with another girl, whereas for HB8 #1 it most likely wouldn't ruin my chances with her.

**HB8 #3:** Got her number recently, doesn't really know my roommates, and has never been over to my apartment before. If I invited her, that would be a strong sign of my intentions, and I would probably be expected to give her my attention the whole night.

If I invite more than one then I could use them as social proof and bounce back and forth, hopefully building more attraction. I would also have a better chance of pulling since I would have more options in case one of them doesn't reciprocate.

I was told that her ex-boyfriend is in town visiting her this weekend from across the country. Her friends basically hinted that she is still hung up on this guy. They are most likely going to be spending a lot of time together the next few days. **I'm wondering how I can give off more value than this guy that I've never met.**

What would be the best course of action for the next few days/weeks? My instinct tell me that I should pull away at this point and become less available in order to draw her back in (I haven't responded to her texts for about 4 days now). Or would it be better to casually text her this weekend while she hanging out with her ex?

I thought about getting her flowers on V-day, but since we aren't technically dating or seeing each other exclusively, I thought it'd be a bit too much.

Okay so on Friday night I went out and I ran into a beautiful girl that I know that is friends with my friend. As the night progressed we ended up coming back to my place for after party and her and I were the only ones there for the time being. To kill time we start fooling around. Now, we didn't have sex but she did sleep in my bed until her friend woke her up after the party. The next day I do some playful texting with her, but it got kind of boring so I stopped. Later that night, she invited me out again. I told her I might end up that way, and at the end of the night a couple friends and I head over. Her and I start kino-ing almost immediately and we joke a bit, but I don't feel as on my game because frankly, I was tired. I grab her legs, she grabs my hand, but it doesn't escalate too much because her friends are around and they don't really know me. I didn't hover around her, I met some friends I hadn't seen in a while and introduced them. Everything was looking pretty good to me going home with her until the bar closed and I forgot my jacket. I ran inside without letting anyone really know and by the time I'm back outside, my phone is dead and they are gone. Shit. So I walk to my car, charge my phone and drive home. I get a text from her asking where I was but when I responded, she was already at her apartment. Game over. 

Next day, a little bit of texting back and forth but it's kind of boring again. I think I just suck at text game, but I drop the conversation and just continue with my day. Now, I'd like to get her ramped up again and I was thinking a little playful texting with suggesting her getting a valentine and sending a picture of a cat asking to be her valentine or something (she doesn't like cats).

We've kissed before at a party and always been flirty. My friends think she likes me. And I know she finds me attractive according to mutual friends. As I said we have been texting a lot recently so it could be too much.

 She's been sick off and on recently and I planned on asking her out tonight. So I was talking to her, just about whatever as usual, the convo itself went well, as usual. Found out she's still sick (this was discussed unrelated to anything about hanging out and was just part of an average conversation). I didn't realize she was still sick. I then thought to myself ""well shit, I was going to ask her out"" so I decided to go ahead and say that I know she's sick but wanted to know if she wanted to go out after she was no longer sick. (I didn't just say ""go out"" though, I said some specific activity, and used ""with me"".  

She replies ""Yeah idk when ill be better though!"" 
I tell her to feel better so we can hangout with a little smiley face thing
She delays a little while to respond then says ""For sure, well I'm going to bed night""

So I'm assuming that's a no for a few reasons. As far her first reply, I'm not sure if that's a yes or if she's just saying that as an excuse to not set it up and put it off indefinitely. As far as her second response, it seemed kind of off and seemed like she was ending the conversation. Overall, there was a little bit of a delayed response and she didn't seem extra happy or anything about it. I'm thinking it's possible that she might just be too nice to actually say no.

A few hours after agreeing she bails again, saying that she has school until 8 pm and would not make it. Ok then I tell her to suggest a day when she actually is free and she says Sunday (so yesterday). We agree that I come over to her place, Friday evening I ask if I should bring anything and low and behold Sunday morning  I get a long winded response that goes like this

I (26F) become pretty good friends with a guy (26M) I'm insanely attracted to, and would like for things to move forward. I feel like I've given plenty of signals, so his lack of action probably means he's just not attracted to me, and that I am deep in the friend zone. However there are still some things that confuse me:

1. He convinces me to go to bars with him and his buddies, with the purpose of picking up girls. When we are there, he dances with me for pretty much the entire time. Why would he pay so much attention to me if he weren't into me?

2. He has mentioned something about me being ""social proof"" - should I assume that means he thinks I'm objectively attractive enough, or is that part irrelevant?

3. This part was weird. One night we got drunk and went out, and after an hour of intensely intimate dancing, I said something like ""Dancing with you like this is really turning me on,"" to which he responded ""heh, so you like it?"" and I said ""Yes, but it can't continue like this."" At that point I assumed that I got my answer and went to talk to someone else, but after a little while the guy motioned me over to join him on the dance floor, and we continued that for over an hour until the night ended. 

At this point: my attraction to him should be obvious, he knows I'm comfortable with casual sex since we talk about it a lot, we are both experienced, and a FWB would be ideal for both of us.

I go to some venues and they are just way too loud. I know I've been told to learn to communicate in loud venues. **But its damn near impossible.** Some places I go, I'm not sure if they are clubs or bars or what. Should I try going to lounges? Would those be quieter? I honestly don't know.


Also I am hearing varied and conflicting information and I'm not sure about certain things and would like clarification:

- It seems people go to clubs to dance to loud music, drink, and hangout with their friends (especially girls), not to meet new people - with the exception of 1 night stands (if they are especially drunk)


Also I'm not having much success with my approaches. I'm at about 50 approaches. This is what I've noticed:


(1) Sometimes the guy shuts you down really quickly. For example:
Me: Opinion opener
Guy: **NEVER**, Its never ok to (insert situation or scenario)


Or, guy, overshadows the girls in the group and answers for them blocking you off from communicating with them

Or
(2) Either the girl or the entire group doesn't hear your opener in the first place because its too damn loud


(3) Girls give stare of death like why is this idiot talking to us and what does he want. This despite use of a FTC


(4) Girl straight up ignores you, looks away, etc, after getting their attention but BEFORE even delivering the opener.



Like ""Hey, real quick..."" before being able to deliver the opener, girl starts acting like you aren't even there.


(5) Girl gives extremely disinterested answer like ""I don't know."" or ""We're stupid. We don't know"".


One time I used the opener ""what's a good name for a 3-legged cat"" (I think got that from one of Strauss' reading materials) to a group two girls and they were like ""3-legged cat? As in you're trying to get in our cab?"". I didn't know what to say next.

The situation is as follows: We hit it off incredibly well - had some of the best sex I've ever had - I became attached - Relationship does a complete 180 and she stops hanging out and acting very cold towards me - We fight, make up, fight, make up - I get terminated from my job and stop hearing from her - Out of the blue she texts me that she needs a serious favor and needs a place to stay, so I agree. 

My relationship with this girl is complicated and she's so goddamn hard to read but it drives me crazy. The first night she stayed with me everything was loads of fun. I kept my distance not trying to make any moves because of the vulnerable position she's in right now. The conversation went very fluid and we were laughing most of the night. Smoked some weed, watched a movie and went to sleep. She very subtly mentioned this morning that she thinks we should just sleep in the same bed.

Specifically what I'm looking for is what should I do to escalate attraction?

I'm 23 and starting up my second year of University. I've been reading seddit and working on getting myself into a good state of mind since my last relationship ended. I've never really been good at approaching women, and that's still probably the weakest part of my game. Once I start talking to people, I feel I successfully come across as fun and engaging.

**First Day Back**
It's my first night back and some old friends let me know about a kegger going on nearby. I haven't been to a college party in awhile, so I head out. After I get in I can't find my friends so I start heading to grab some beer, being kind of socially awkward. HB8 walks by and makes eye contact, I hold and she comes over to introduce herself to me.
We chat a bit about majors and stuff, then a guy comes over who appears to be with her, I introduce myself and chat with them a bit before excusing myself to find my friends. Turns out they want to ditch the party 15 minutes after I got there to hit a bar. I figure I'll follow along for now.
We head to a decent bar where I end up dancing and chatting up the bartender after she brings me ice while I'm on the dance floor. No close but had a nice time, progress made towards outcome independence and working out my AA.

**A Few Nights Later**
Head out to a ""Black Out Party"" at a bar. Basically wear black clothes. Super fancy right? Same group of friends, but I end up losing them fairly early on as they're doing god knows what and I'm in the mood to just rock the dance floor. HB5 starts dancing with me and I relax there for a bit before taking off to do my own thing. I'm not having much luck and the AA is back so I'm not really making any moves except trying to enjoy myself. Decide to move to a different area and see an HB7 dancing alone. Approach head on, smile and start dancing. She gets into it and we get close and start grooving together. I ask if she wants to go grab a drink and we get to talking. Find out she goes to school and lives a couple cities over, but she tells me she wants me to have her number anyway as her friends are getting her to leave. Texted her for a bit but A)I have no texting game and B)I'm not out to start a relationship, much less a long distance one. 

Feel great and really helping with the outcome independence mindset. Still have some heavy AA issues, especially when it comes to multiple sets, but I'm making progress and it feels good.

**Campus bar bummer**
I don't know what happened here, nothing I did prior could get me in state. Went in alone and figured I'd start dancing once the floor got going and try to enjoy myself, then make moves if I felt like it but just couldn't get down. Went home kind of early and felt down that I couldn't even entertain myself.

**Fraternity Social**
Prior to deciding to go out tonight, I bang out some schoolwork. One assignment in particular is nasty, I don't have any idea what is going on. After an hour I've managed to figure it all out and I feel pumped. I need to go out!
A fraternity I'm rushing with some friends is hosting a social bbq/kegger. Decide to show up as it's a good time to try to make an impression and hopefully fall into an organization that'll help me be more social (another thing I'm really working on). Get there and play games with the guys. Ladies start filtering in way after we get started, but everyone's having a good time and I'm managing to let myself be at the center of a rooms attention, something I have trouble with when I don't have people I know around.
End up opening a 2-set, and one of them leaves to go take care of something. I chat up the HB8 who's standing near me but she isn't giving off anything I pick up on as an IOI, so I just keep talking to be social. Accidentally forget to introduce myself to her, but loudly introduce myself to her friends when they come back.
One noise complaint later and they need a bunch of us to vacate. Someone comes around and lets everyone know about a party going on nearby we can all shift to, HB8 is nearby so I tell her we are going there. She loops her arm into mine, and we head out. Shortly afterwards, we find out her friend is going back to her dorm, but HB8 is still down to party. Before we get too far the friend begins panicking over the phone and insisting she come home. I decide to be a gentleman and walk her there. Some light kino goes on while we walk, and end up making out outside her friends dorm while we wait to be buzzed in. I hang out for a bit but she's visiting from a couple cities over so I decide to leave now that she's home safe and wish her a good night. Felt pretty good getting a K-close from a pretty lady and really reinforced some of the game that is spoken about here. Outcome independence once again reinforced, as was the abundance mindset.

**Epilogue**
I'm hoping I can maintain the positive emotion I have going on for next weekend, and many weekends afterwards, but I've been on kind of a roller coaster lately. Recently got dumped by a girl who, I thought, was way hotter than I had any right to. But I'm definitely finding that when I don't think that way, when I just go out and talk to the women I find attractive, I'm not out of my league. I'm a great catch and it's a lot of fun to meet new people, whether or not anything more comes of it. I just need to work on getting into state before I go out, hopefully without needing to crush some difficult piece of work, and definitely work on getting over my AA.",,False,,t5_2s7xh,False,,,True,t3_10bulv,http://www.reddit.com/r/askseddit/comments/10bulv/fr_new_to_the_game_documenting_my_progress/,

&gt;My self-summary

I feel this would be better in person, but generally my attitude is that people don't come to NYC to be boring, so I respect that idea by spending almost all of my time doing as much as I can and taking advantage of the city. This includes sharing experiences, exploring neighborhoods, museums, galleries, oysters, parks, finding the best rooftops, and discovering the best Thai restaurants in Queens. Yet, never saying 'no' to a trip out of the city for hiking, rafting, camping or travel. I try to never be inside during warm days and catch up on work and relaxation on the rainy or cold ones. I enjoy meeting as many people as possible because most have something interesting to offer.

&gt;What I’m doing with my life

Trying to make the most of it. Never stopping. I listen to NPR and read the New Yorker in between.

&gt;I’m really good at

Finding the best coffee. Getting a seat on the subway without pissing off the elderly or pregnant. Finding the best jukebox. Knowing how to get things organized. Playing multiple instruments. Framing a shot. Self-deprecation. Wine.

&gt;The first things people usually notice about me

My voice and laugh.

&gt;The six things I could never do without

I'm sure I would find a way to survive without whatever six things I would name. Though seriously, my Passport would be #1.

I was with all my friends from high school and was hard drinking and class skippin’. I never got laid. I didn’t even make out with a girl. I was shy, fat, drunk, stoned, and carried a proud 2-point-something GPA after graduating 20th in a class of 850. Before my junior year, I transferred to a local college in my hometown. I focused meticulously on class and my part-time job because I hated school and wanted to get to work so I could be away from all the happily laid, fun-having people around me. I took 18-24 credits every semester, took summer school and intersession and graduated less than two years later earning Dean’s List every semester. I was shy, fat, drunk, stoned, and a virgin. Not even as much as a single kiss. At least I was done with school. 

I got a job selling life insurance and everyone I knew thought I would be a natural at it. I hated it. I hated the long hours and the rah-rah-rah motivation. I let my contract expire and started lifeguarding at the local beach club. I had no stress. No expectations of anyone or anything. Under the tutelage of a member there, I started exercising rigorously, followed a carefully planned diet, and grew strong and lean. I revived the A+ student I inherently am, tracking my meals and workouts, the amount of water I drank, and the amount of sleep I got (which I still do to this day). I studied food and exercise. In a short period of time I lost 80lbs and have kept them off for 3 years.

Some other positive stuff happened in my life, including a new job, since then. Randomly, I even got laid once by a friend of a friend who asked “when did you decide to become a superhero?” after she saw the new me, but I essentially had no part in making it happen. I could open girls, just like people write, by saying “Hey!” or “Hi” and literally had nothing to say next. I couldn’t have told you my home address if I was asked because my brain felt so empty. I was going out 3-4 times a week and then stopped because just going out, being around girls was too demoralizing after a couple months. I felt like I was encased in glass walls wherever I went. When I tried to dig down and find my confidence, it wasn’t there. I didn’t even know what feeling I was looking for. Girls would tell me how their friends thought I was cute, or would just come up to me and tell me themselves, but my reaction was/is always something like, “Good to know”, “Thanks!”, and eventually progressed to, “Yeah, whatever” because it obviously didn’t really mean anything.

In my circle of friends there was a guy who was as natural as the term implies. He was usually unemployed, generally scummy towards the crew, but always, always had a new girl with him. No wingmen, no tactics, just a revolving door. I admired and envied him for that, but he had nothing to teach. Recently I was at a boat party with mutual friends of the scummy guy (SG) and he brought out a pretty cute chick. She was funny and having a good time just being around SG, which I thought was a testament to the quality of his game. After we all left the yacht club, she climbed into her Porsche turbo, and rode off. Later it came up in conversation that she was the daughter of a local millionaire and that she worked as a crossfit coach. SG’s game worked on, in my eyes, a girl overflowing with value; cute, funny, into weightlifting/crossfit and ridiculously wealthy. The feeling that coursed through me was a wave of disbelief, anger, frustration, envy, and, worst of all, inadequacy. It was a feeling I was familiar with only in my most depressed states of mind.

I’m really at a loss and to the point where, despite all the positive feedback and gratitude that I see in seddit (just like everywhere on reddit), to me it’s like a huge mirage. Or I’m just incapable of generating esteem and derailing any effort from the get-go. I have an unbelievably strong capacity to stop bad behaviors, I stopped drinking and smoking cold turkey, I stopped eating unhealthy foods, I noFapped for a while, but that was so easy that I went to noPMO. I can stop doing anything, but can’t start doing anything. No book/blog/post can shove me at a girl, or at least give me a clue as to what should be rolling around in my empty brain and for that reason I think I probably need a coach to get started. Questions/thoughts? Interested parties?
 
Thanks to anyone who read this whole mess.

Tl;dr: Lived somewhere crappy, moved somewhere awesome. Was fat, got ripped. Hated job, got new job. Can’t talk to girls.

The book *Magic Bullets* describes a situation like this that occurs.  In the scenario, the guy kisses the girl, sexual tension is released, she slowly starts to lose interest, he gets clingy.  Game Over.  It said the solution is to rebuild attraction and try again.  However, it's weird because we've known each otehr for a while, so it wasn't really a traditional attraction phase.  In other words, I'm not sure how the phases went in this particular instance because we've known each other a while.

They're not restricted to HBs. When guys are busting each other's balls, it definitely takes the form of a shit-test. AFCs usually go defensive and outright deny the accusations.

I've made a lot of progress towards improving my responses to these tests. I can usually recognize them now and I understand they're just playful ways of teasing each other.

However, how do people feel about shit-tests where it's being suggested that you're hitting on someone? Here are 2 examples.


********************************************************
********************************************************

The other day, in my acting class, one of the girls said she had a cold and the teacher ""shit-tested"" me.

Me: You got a cold?

HB: Yea.

Teacher, busting my balls: You won't be able to take her in the back and french kiss her!

Now, in my AFCs day, I would have outright denied the accusations that I was hitting on her! Nowadays, my responses are different. I agreed and amplified. Here was my response:

Me: You got me! I was hoping to do that, but now my plans for the night are ruined!


I do think that response is infinitely better than the AFC response I would have given a few months ago. However, I'm not sure how I feel about suggesting that I'm hitting someone before she's attracted to me. Like Neil Strauss says: ""You can't hit on a girl until she's attracted to you.""


********************************************************
********************************************************

Here's another example. In that same class, I play a part with another HB in which we're playing a couple.

HB: I hope I won't have kiss BinmanPUA!

Again, in my AFC days, I would have said something like ""Don't worry, we don't have to kiss."" Here's what I said instead:

Me: Yea, we're gonna have to kiss! And you better put some effort into it, because I'm gonna be judging you!


Again, I agreed and amplified. However, my response also suggested that I was attracted to her and that I would enjoy kissing her (she's pretty good-looking).

1335709535.0,9,self.askseddit,sy5wr,I think the girl I am pursing is dating another guy. What do I do?,14,5,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/askseddit/comments/sy5wr/i_think_the_girl_i_am_pursing_is_dating_another/,"Short version: 

I think this girl is dating another guy while still going out with me. She never mentioned a bf in all the contacts we have, i.e. lunch date, hiking date, etc.

1) What do I do? I don't know if I gain anything by asking if she is seeing someone.

2) If I do ask, and her response is ""yes I am going out with someone,"" what should be my response?

Long version: 

This girl I have been pursuing have been going out alone with me to a couple of places. I have been using techniques and it seems to be working. (hard to tell since she shows mixed signals and combined with my inexperience, it is expected)
Here is some background: I been see this girl for a couple of months now. I fumble a bit during the first few contacts. i.e. I am not that experienced at picking up girls. Moreover, she was not giving clear signs. i.e. If I invite her to places and do things, she would not flatly refuse but she would not say a definite yes. As if she was unsure. Now it's the next quarter and we have a class together. She wanted to me to be her lab partner and I said sure. I figured it's a great way to spend more time together.
Here is why I made the assumption she was single:

1) I have not seen her with another guy. (Could be hard to say on this, but I figured since this is a university environment, i figured if she is seeing someone, she is bound to be walking with them sometimes)

2) Her phone's wallpaper does not have a picture of any guy. Just a cute picture of two bunnies? Is this a flagged I missed? People have told me to not over analyze things so I didn't on this one.

3) Finally she makes no reference to a boyfriend in our conversations. Even after I verbally expressed interested in her. I know it's not something I should have done. But I was noob back then. (just for FYI, her answer to the request of the date was ""I'll think about it."") Again not over-analyzing thing, I figured if she was serious about someone else, she would say, ""Sorry I am already dating someone.""
We have been going out together lately to places (park and lunch). Then one day she refused an offer from me to take her out to lunch and when we do meet up for a study session, this guy brings her food and they talk like they are boyfriend or girlfriend. i.e. ""So I will see you tonight?""
Should I confront her on this issue to verify my assumption? Or should I just play it as if she never mention a boyfriend, then I will not assume anything?

Again if I do ask, and her response is yes, what should be my ""cool"" response to it?

The only reason I ask is some people here say you should fail quickly and move on so you can get more practice and not to waste your time.

How should I end the relationship? ,15,3,52,http://www.reddit.com/r/askseddit/comments/sttsx/gf_of_2_months_not_responding_how_should_i_end/,"**UPDATE: After not responding to my last text on Wedesday early afternoon where I invited her on a date she has texted at 11:45 which is the same time I know she gets out of work tonight. Her: ""Hi!"" I'm just going to ignore it for now. At least until tomorrow afternoon/night when I finish with all my finals. Then maybe I'll call her see whats her problem.**

**Question:** My gf never responded after I invited her out for a date. Should I just not respond and take this as a message that the relationships over or should I say something to officially end it? Nothing mean, just want to text her telling her it's over, not sure what her problems been in the last few weeks was fun while it lasted, maybe a subtle neg (shes narcissistic with low self-esteem so I wouldn't feel bad about this), enjoy life bye. Or should I just leave things the way they are now and just forget it completely? She went from hot to cold overnight. 

**Background for those interested:** I'm 21, she's 25. Met in class and were dating for over a little over 2 months and eventually became boyfriend girlfriend. She seemed extremely into me.  Was very sweet, texting me that she was thinking about me, calling me cute, sexy, handsome, sweet. Sometimes we would text back and forth bantering and inside jokes throughout the day. She would also respond quickly and apologize if she was late to respond. She always initiated text convos and kept them up. I never texted her if she didn't respond or expressed any type of neediness that I can think of. She invited me to meet her family, and we even displayed affection around them which she initiated. She was trying to persuade me to go out of the country just me and her to meet her extended family. She talked to me about taking class together next semester. Talked to me about future dates. Told me how much she wanted me to kiss her. Her siblings liked me. Everything seemed great. 

Then all that abruptly ended for some reason 3 weeks ago when she started to become busy. She attributed it to school which is understandable as we have finals and she has extra classes and works full time. She canceled prearranged plans with me which she already paid for. Didn't show up to class. She continued to text me occasionally but wasn't enthusiastic or responsive. After I would respond she would never say anything back even if I was alluding to an inside joke which was really odd behavior. Asked her if something was wrong she said no and even asked me why I would think that. This whole time I haven't seen her since she didn't show up to class which I assumed indicated she was seriously busy. I told her that I wouldn't text her since I know she's busy so whenever she becomes free again to let me know.  She didn't respond but continued to start convos that she wouldn't respond too or if she did was very kurt. Not sure why she didn't just take this as a queue to end it if she didn't want to talk to me. She would text me out of the blue how she was almost done with finals or she has XX finals left to go. 

Thought things were picking up though since school was ending. Emailed me a funny pic last week. She texted me that she finished all her finals on Monday night. I responded telling her how many I have left and asking hers went. She didn't respond until Tuesday morning. Apologized for taking too long to respond but said it was because she was sleeping. I never once called her out on her response time nor even indicated it bothered me but she would still always apologize. I text her and make a funny comment and she responds back immediately telling me how I'm hilarious. She was positive and responsive so I thought things were back to normal. Yesterday(Wednesday), I ask her text her about how she's enjoying her free time. She responds positively and immediately and asks me how things are with me. I tell her I'm busy studying for classes and I can't wait to finish. I also invite her to do this fun outdoor activity that we've before together and which she was asking to do again with me. She never responds. Haven't seen her in almost three weeks due to her class absences and being busy. The whole situation seems kind of weird. She was a very considerate, studious person, who didn't drink alcohol or party. I really cant think of anything I could have done wrong. Last time we spent time together we were making out and talking and joking around. After I left her place she texted me how much fun she had like she usually does. After interaction everything just went downhill and she started to become cold.

This girl is showing a multitude of IOIs (physical, conversational), is receptive to kino, and generally seems interested in me.

She almost never initiates conversation/texting and will always wait for me to greet her first, be it in real-life or in text communication.

Thing is, even when it looks like she's giving me the shoulder, I can simply open her up with a few words and suddenly it's like she was waiting for me to talk to her, and we'll talk for hours. If I don't make a point of initiating anything, nothing happens. She has even straight up said she is interested in me, so why is it like this?

The problem is, I really can't tell if I'm more invested in her than she is in me, or if she's simply a different type of girl who refuses to initiate. Is this a way of hiding interest? Should I just ignore this, and initiate all the time?

1. Work on yourself (gym, finances, interests) voraciously, and be very picky about the women you want to target.  When your shit starts to come together, your confidence will naturally be boosted, these women will notice, and you will succeed.

I've been told I'm really attractive, I'd say about physically a 7, but apparently I'm intimidating because I'm confident, and that puts guys off. I'm also pretty nerdy, at least in the sense that I have a lot of guy friends and we play video games together.

Its probably just because I'm in high school, but this really sucks. I'm lonely, and although I'm constantly told I'm pretty I feel like there's something wrong with me.

I'm a Swedish freshman in U.S. college and I've noticed that I tend to make great first impressions on people. I think it's because I care about my health and how I dress, I can easily make people laugh, and I really don't mind being the center of attention.

But as people get to know me more and more, it seems as if they like me less. And I don't know why! I think people get bored of me, but I don't understand why. Someone told me that I should try to say ""I"" less and ""you"" more when I talk to people, especially girls.  Is this true? I'm not usually very talkative, or at least I wasn't before college.  Could it be so that people are drawn towards me when insecure as they don't know too many other people and that when they make more friends, they get sick of my excessive talking?

I think what I'll do is try to talk less about myself this weekend as see how it goes. If it goes well, then I think I'm probably talking too much.

**Other questions:**

* What's a good way to flirt, talk, or even get to know ~~girls~~ people in small classrooms where the teacher would notice if I started talking to somebody? 

* I started smoking pot last summer and I notice it makes flirting much easier and the girls I talk to tend to become MUCH more comfortable with me. Could anyone explain this?

* The dancing scene here is mostly grinding up on girls to eventually hook up with them. I tried to get used to this the first 1 or 2 months, and then I got tired of how ridiculous it is. Now I try to go to classier parties where I can dance salsa or ballroom as I find it much more giving and entertaining.  The problem is that when I go to these other parties, I tend to get uncomfortable and leave. Should I try to get used to grinding with girls again?

* If you have any other useful tips or tricks for a college student, I would love to hear them.

However, a couple of nights ago we were pre-drinking and me and her were flirting hard, we're going to different events but we were probably gonna meet up afterwards and hang out. Anyway, I was out in town and just randomly found her stumbling around on her own really wasted. She was drunk as hell so me and a friend just got in a taxi with her and went back to put her to bed. When we got back it was just me and her in my room and she was on my bed, saying that she really liked me and wanted us to have sex, while taking her clothes off. We were touching each other but I really wasn't that drunk and wasn't going to take advantage. I said I liked her too but that it should be more than ""a drunken thing"" and that we'd chat about it soon. Shortly after this she throws up all in my bed and apologises profusely. I take her to her room and put her to bed.

The next day after I had cleaned it all up, she comes to me and it's pretty cool - just like before. We laugh and joke about it and we agree that she ""owes me big time"". She remembers throwing up in my room, but I don't know if she remembers saying she liked me etc. Either way, it was definitely still on between us.

However the day after that, I see her in the cafeteria when I'm with my friends and she just has a generic chat with all of us (""what are you guys doing tonight?"", etc.) A couple of hours later I go upstairs to see what she's doing and she's unsure but that she might go out. I say I'm gonna stay in and we should hang out, but she barely responds. Basically, it seems really OFF with her now. Before whenever we'd see each other she'd come over, we'd hug and then flirt/banter a bit. Now it's just generic small talk and me starting the conversation.

I know I'm probably gonna get rinsed by you guys for focusing too much on one girl, but I just don't know what's happened and if there's any way I can bring it back? It seems that the chemistry's kind-of died.

So from what I've read here I need to start practicing and get rejected until the point I don't give a flying fuck, fine by me. I'm at a university where there are plenty of opportunities to strike up conversations everyday, all day long. Which I'd very much like to do. I often pass the same people different days as you'd expect. What I'm getting at is that I don't want there to be 100+ girls in my school who've rejected me. So I plan on going down town to practice. 

My biggest weakness is simply having a conversation about nothing. My conversations on day-to-day basis with my friends and school-colleagues are usually just about something science-related, not very helpful in the field, especially in clubs!

I could walk up to a woman smiling saying, ""Hi, I'm John"" very confidently, and maintain eye-contact. After that, stalemate. I don't want to resort to cheap lines like, Me:""How's your drink"" Her:""Fine"" Me:""Kewl"" or the bone dry ""How's the night treating you?""

Clubs are loud, impossible to have a decent intellectual conversation in there and people are usually not looking for one. Need some advice on openers, topics or some guidelines to grab to when I'm freezing up (I don't want silence, unless it's appropriate).

P.S. If a girl asks me to buy her a drink, I'll promptly respond (thanks to seddit)  ""Oh, sorry, you must be mistaking me with every guy you've ever met"" or order her a glass of water with lemon.

If she throws the ""I have a bf"" I'll say ""I bet mine's cuter"", ""That's fine"" or ""Wait! I don't want to hear about your problems, I'm out having fun"" whatever fits the situation, and simply move on.

I think self-confidence is extremely important...for life in general as well as PU.  But, I'd like to think that building self-confidence is a way to enable you to do POSITIVE things.

It's easy to go into this thinking 'that won't happen to me', but do you guys find yourself becoming more selfish as you study more PUA?  Or, is PU such an important activity in your life, that you accept a selfish state?

She's new in town so I get to spend time with her, showing her around. Thing is, I don't know for sure if she's sending me IOIs or does these things out of habit. Such as playing with her hair. She does it all the time. And I haven't really been in situations to notice if she does it when I'm not around. Or, my friend told me that she kept turning around and looking at me for a second or two (she was at another table but a seat or two away by my left, both seated facing the same way) when I was out at a bar with all my friends. But when its just us two, she seems to avoid eye contact. She's told me she's not looking for any relationships. I usually take that with a grain of salt. But in her case, I have no idea if she's playing hard to get or is just this way because she has plenty of male friends back home. For the time being, I've been simply keeping it friendly and didn't flirt with her so far (mainly because I thought it wouldn't feel right). I intend on just being myself.

Went out with a friend of mine. He introduced me to two guys I've never met before. We go out to a nightclub and get a table. 

I go to the bathroom and when I'm back, our table and the chicks next to our table are mingling. I go around and talk to each of the chicks for about 5 minutes. One of them catches my eye, and I game her a little bit. I go around and do some sets.

So one of my friend's friend, lets call him J, is talking to the chick that I was interested in. Not a big deal. The club is really loud, so he's like typing messages into his phone and giving it to her. This goes on for about an hour, while I'm going around the club doing some sets. 

I head back to the table. The chick comes up to me and starts talking to me. Asking if I've been hitting on chicks, and asks if I have a BMM (blackberry). I tease her, ""I think you're the player here. I saw you chatting with my friend J for a while"". She responds, ""Ohhh he's kinda weird. I wanna get to know you more""

So that's my cue. Grabbed her hand, isolated, and did a same night lay.

That was last week. I'm chilling with the chick and she shows me her phone. So J's still text messaging her. I msg my friend...""Dude J's still messaging that chick, he knows I hit it right?""

Apparently J's pissed I took that chick, and still texting her trying to hook up with her. I'm not threatened at all, just think it's kinda weird to want someone's leftovers.

So just wanted to know your opinion guys. That was the first night I've met J, and I'll probably never see him again. Was I dishonorable or no? TBH if this was one of my close friends, I would've asked him if it was cool or not. 

edit: Thanks guys for the feedback. Think I just feel a little guilty since that was probably one of the guy's only sets this year. But on the real, a beautiful chick's a horrible thing to waste.

So before I tell my story, let me tell you a little about my friend. He's very un-self aware, and Not the sharpest tool in the shed. He's always been the type of guy who tries way too hard doesn't know a lot about stuff that he thinks he knows, and comes out really obnoxious. Basically he'll lecture a girl about a car despite the fact she's completely disinterested. He's never had a gf, always had onitis.(had it for like 2 years for one girl)..and despite being average looking..always messed up with girls. He doesn't know he's bad at it..and doesn't realize he sucks and would probably not listen to many people.

This is going to be cringe worthy for you guys.

Anyway, he recently got a girlfriend who is 3 years younger than him and in hs. She's..about a 4. Cross eyed. Anyway this girl used to hit on a lot of guys, and she's been pretty far with another guy sexually...probably had sex. 

My friend sends here 2 paragraph long texts about waking up next to her and how he'll love her and give her anything she wants etc..and she'll reply with ""okay :) cool"" or some lame girl text talk..you guys know what I mean.

They've been going out for 3 months, and apparently she has a ""purity ring"" and won't let him have sex with her...she wouldn't even let him see her naked or finger her. He basically BEGS her..no seriously..BEGS her for sexual activity...I'm not joking. He'll ask her to come do something with him like shower and she'll say that she's busy or that she's already showered...and he'll beg her to come to play with her ""wittle man""(no seriously)..and he'll use baby talk in a sexual way that comes off really fucking creepy. He's EXTREMELY jelous and very insecure and asks her if she likes him about 10 times a day. no exaggerating. he gets EXTREMELY angry when she talks on other guys on facebook..(and she does flirt with them though)...

She's been farther with other guys and often flirts with other dudes on facebook. My theory is she sleeps with other guys and she's using him. He takes her out on dates a lot, showers her with gifts..EVERYDAY..like leaving her cards, balloons, chocolates the works etc..and he pays for all the dates. He's whipped as fuck and if anyone say anything about his girlfriend..something that's NOT even an insult.. he gets really protective and will say stuff like ""let's fight dawg"" despite him never being in a fight. For example if you say you love apples and she hates apples and you tell her as a joke ""omg how could you hate apples"" he'll get really angry and try to ""protect"" her.

Also, since she's like 15 she's VERY immature and has typical 15 year old fantasies like marriage..and she sold him on this...she is saving herself(that's cool)..but she wants him to marry her..like seriously. My friend always say that he wants to marry her and that they're perfect for each other and that he loves to wake up next to her and stuff.

He's serious about the marriage. This girl has some weird fantasy where she they get married and live together and move out.. Let my inform you my friend basically has one shitty job which he blows all the money he gets on her.

He's spent lots of money on shit for her. She's got by the throat..seriously...I'm not sure how I should tell him this. I've said very little so far.

And to hopefully provide insight for others in possibly similar situations.

Many of the anxiety threads I've read treat the condition as if it exists within concious thought patterns. They actually 'think' thoughts that make them anxious.

I seem to be firmly on the other end of the spectrum. I've always been very confident and objective within my own thoughts, yet a subconcious anxiousness appears to restrict the expression of my true confidence.

Last week I went speed-dating, a new experience which revealed some more aspects of my condition to me.
From what I understand of anxiety, everything should have gotten easier as the night went on. But it didn't quite go like that.
Sure, I started off a bit nervous, like any normal person, but I was confident and able to express myself reasonably well.
But, as the night went on, I noticed that my mind itself was getting exhausted and I was finding it more and more difficult to keep expressing myself at a high level.
From what I understand, this is very typical of introversion, and over the years I've found many signs that indicate the fact that I'm heavily introverted.

Is this type of anxiety classified? Or am I actually not anxious at all, and these are merely effects of heavy introversion?

Is it plausible that anxiety effects introverts differently to how it effects extroverts? Well,.. obviously it is plausible. But how?

Before you read. Just know that I am not asking for beginner advice so read through.

Little background. I have been casually dating her for almost 2 months. 

So I met this girl. I knew she was interested, so I got her number. We hung out, she would not put out for a couple outings. Which made me think about why that is. I figured she was a virgin for reasons not to be explained. Turned out she was. I did not ask her she told me when we were going at it. She was surprised I did not freak out. I told her it was up to her if she wanted to seal the deal. She obliged. 

Now the kind of outings I take her on are not just any normal dates. I bring this girl to abandoned buildings, hiking, and mostly adventures. There have been no al dates, picnic adventures, I cook for her, ect ect... I am a very spontaneous person when I am with a pretty girl I like, there is no way she gets bored when we are doing stuff. I bite her when I want, grab her ass when I want, playfully push her when I want, ect.. ect. She has told me I keep her on her toes. 

She shit tests. I catch the obvious ones, liker saying my hobbies are weird, I am weird, acting uninterested... I may have missed some but I doubt it. there have been bigger shit tests like one time. We were exploring an abandoned building and we met this dude and we split up for about an hour I was doing my own thing... climbing shit, and taking picture. When we got out she told me she got to talk to him and it was so cool haha. So I say oh yeah? With the biggest smile on my face and she says yeah and changes subjects. This is were it gets good. She was with this guy, and my roommate the entire time I was away. my roomate/good friend told me after that she was quieter than normal when they were without me. 

last shit test was when we were hanging out in my room before an adventure she told me about this guy that asked for her number, she said she gave it to him, and he wanted to smoke with her. She then tells me he said it really weirdly with slang and lingo. She asked me to look at it and tell her what it meant. I was busy changing my shirt and getting my camera ready so I said hold on. She asked for me to look twice and was going to but we started talking about something else, and I/we forgot. 

This is where I need advice

She is always smiling, and laughing when we are together. 

She has texted me before saying let's go wreck havoc.

She has said how it is so cool that we have not grown up in the same high school.

I do not know the word for this, but she will always ask if something is alright or ask if I like this or that...

She has texted during sex when when she was on top. 

She will check her phone and when it is in front of me I can see she has no texts. I know she is not looking at the time, for shes a watch.

So I expressed interest in a relationship a little bit ago, not directly but I got the point across. She kind of dodged answering it. But then told me that her parents want to meet me because her parents know all of her friends. Then said but it is okay if you do not want to. I said I would. So that will happen. She than said that she doesn't want anything bad to happen because I am not friends with most of my exes. She also said that she is still friends with all of her exes. I took all of that as she just wants to be friends with sex. Although she did not say this.

So she is out of town and she wants to take me to an event she got free tickets to when she gets back. 

It really frustrated me when she did not give me any answer.

So I have what I am going to say to her and I am going to say it to her. But I do not know the best time to say it. Like right when we meet up, after the event and shenanigans. Or wait a couple days. She will be back in a week. So the situation could change?

Here is what I am going to tell her in person

Blank we need to talk. I feel like I am your tour bus guide that you are using to gain new experiences, including sex. Do not get me wrong though. Sex between us is good, and there is so many more sexual endeavors I want to have with you... Before I go any further, I want you to know something about me. When I meet a pretty girl I either want to have sex with her. Or date her. Or have nothing to do with her. It is very rare me to want two of those from someone. I have not had all three emotions yet. Now back to why all of this is relevant. On (date) before you left for (blank) I expressed interest in a relationship. Ia that correct? I have the impression you want to be friends. Which is okay with me. (It really is not... But it will be my shit test). It really frustrates me that I do not understand your response. I want to know your opinion on this situation.

Sooooo too much? Not enough? Changes? Don't do it? Opinions? Advice?

Ask for anymore information you need to make a thorough comment/response

Hey guys. Short version of my background: i'm a 19 year old virgin with no experience with women getting the full seddit treatment. So now i'm confident now, i relaxed around woman, i'm really sociable and i have made a lot of friends in a short time.

There are a couple of girls from class that i always flirt with, there is one in particular. Today we gathered to study with her and another friend from the class. At certain point we were talking and we (me and her) had a pretty sexual tension going on, and suddenly she threw in something like ""if you keep doing X you wont imagine what i'm gonna do"". To what i reply ""show me"". She then sat right next to me and licked my face from chin to forehead, and went back to the chair she was sitting before. 
I was fucking shocked, all my confidence and seddit improvement just fell off and i became nervous, so fucking nervous. I wasn't really showing it on the outside, but fuck i didn't know what the hell to do. At this point in the afternoon me and my other friend were about to leave. I went to the bathroom, calmed my self and said: ""this is not staying like this, i gotta do something before i leave"". So i thought of doing the same thing to her before going. So that i tried, and failed as she just moved away and said ""you want to eat me alive?"". Of course i replied: ""i was just giving back your lick"". She said bye to my friend and she stood outside the door as i looked into her eyes and i said ""well this is how it's gonna be huh?"". She came closer grabbed my face and kissed me in the neck.

Well that was long, sorry haha So this is probably so silly that you must be laughing, but it was not for me. I need any advice you can give.

[Update],14,3,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/askseddit/comments/1g2qq5/3_dates_and_the_girl_wont_let_me_do_anything_more/,"So this girl approaches me on on the street and we went on 2 good dates. Chemistry and physical escalation was good.

We've been somewhat in contact for TWO MONTHS. I've never had to move this slow.

Between our third date she started acting out, flaked on me THREE times in a row hours before our date with made up excuses but I was cool about it and just said no problem. She didn't seem so motivated compared to the other girls I've dated. Another issue is she is a habitual liar(but generally in a harmless non malicious way), seemingly lying about trivial details about her life, from work, to school, various things. I've never figured out why.

On our third date, she was acting very different, she seemed uninterested and she barely wanted to kiss me here and there and it was closed mouth kisses. Physically and emotionally she was withdrawn. At that moment I felt that she didn't even like me. In general, with other girls I've dated we've moved very quickly.

She was and is dating another guy.

So after the third date we talked a little but I generally kept radio silent for a few weeks because I lost interest completely and she just wasn't putting forth any effort and I didn't feel like we were moving anywhere physically and emotionally. This was taking WAY too long. I've never had to date a girl for 2 months without the relationship moving foreword and just didn't feel like she even liked me. I felt like she was just bored with her life and wanted someone to take her out, and she wanted to keep me on the side in case something bad happened with the other guy. I don't like being used.

She hit me up a few times to hang out, we set something up and I canceled on a date 2 days before the meeting.

Then she recently a week after our planned date she hit me up again and asked, ""hey is everything okay?""

And I don't even know what to tell her, what should I tell her guys? I've never been in this sort of situation so I have no idea how to approach it.

I told her it was and acted warm.

And I don't even know what to tell her, what should I tell her? I've never been in this sort of situation so I have no idea how to approach it.

my issues

-i feel like she doesn't like me

-we're not progressing emotionally or physically

-moving too slow

I'm honestly confused, she's been extremely aloof about me and suddenly now, she seems to care more(I didn't contact her for over a week. I'd like to ask her what her motives are for hanging out with me, or if she's even interested because it's clear she wants to hang out again but I'm really uninterested in a repeat of date 3. I don't want to waste my time, effort, and emotional investment on someone who may be using me, however I am open to dating her.


She's very private because she ""doesn't like anyone knowing her"" despite me opening up. I even tried asking her what she was looking for(something casual, hooking up, something serious), she gave me some very vague answer and basically I couldn't get anything out of her.


**How do I ask her this questions or find out what's going on without seeming like a dick?**


I'd like to ask her what her motives are for hanging out with me, if she likes me, or if she's even interested, and what sort of relationship she's looking for, because it's clear she wants to hang out again but I'm really uninterested in a repeat of date 3. I don't want to waste my time, effort, and emotional investment on someone who may be using me, however I am open to dating her.

I generally communicate well with the people I'm dating but this girl is something different.

I bar tend there and she sat at the bar by herself. We got to talking and turned out that we had a lot in common, so I decided, just for the hell of it, to give her my number. I've done this a few other times but never had anyone actually call/text me. Well she did 2 days later. We talked for an hour and decided to meet tonight at a restaurant for dinner! So far so good right?

Well here's the thing, I just finalized my divorce in March and had been separated for over 8 months before that. During that entire time I haven't gone out on a date with anyone, and prior to that only with my wife while we were married. I've hooked up with a few girls while on my own, but that's what they essentially were - girls from 24-26 years old. And it was girls who were/are friends so it was never ""dating"", just hanging out together. This woman is 34 (I'm 36) recently divorced, has a kid, etc. In other words, someone I probably should be more compatible with than girls 10+ years younger than me. So I'm going into this with a different mindset. 

Knowing all this, would we all agree this is a date I'm going on tonight? Not just a ""get to know you"" meet-up? And since this is the first date I'm going on with a stranger, what are some topics that you think shouldn't be talked about on the first date? I'm pretty open, but I know a lot of people aren't.

**UPDATE**

Now, I haven't talked to her about this, as ""I don't actually know this"".  And she hasn't brought it up.  We're still getting to know each other, and she hasn't mentioned a few things that do confirm this.

I feel as though this has been somewhat of an obstacle in my interactions with women. 

I'd like to develop a capacity for more fluid thinking. What are some good ways to do that? A couple of things I can think of are listening to more comedy and taking improv classes. I don't really have the time for improv classes though. I have a 40 minute commute to work, so ideally what I'm looking for is audio materials I can listen to or thinking/talking excercises I can do while driving (that won't distract me too much from driving.) 

Another related thing is verbosity, to a certain extent. I'm not much of a talker, and in a lot of my conversations a do a lot of listening and not much talking.

(mistake one, I feel like I broke the veneer she had of me being ""mysterious and reclusive"", her words, not mine). I then proceeded to get attached for absolutely no reason other than I fantasized about how she told me the night before, after we first made out, that I make her nervous, and I thought that was fucking adorable (mistake two). The next day, which was friday, I called her (mistake three). She didn't pick up or return my call. Since then, I've seen her on campus on numerous and our conversations were limited to strong eye contact and mild kino (on her part. I used to kino her before I got attached. She'll just do something like hit my arm.) and just ""Hey"" ""hey"" ""not much"" etc... Thats how our convos went before we hooked up.

Anyway, I'm not going to go too much at detail so **in the end she told her friend which told my friend that apparently there's another guy in the picture all of a sudden, she has a problem with ""leading guys on"", and that I remind her of her ex-boyfriend.**

That's the part that bothered me most, because I definitely have options and social skills and I haven't been needy towards her at all, but this is the third fucking time that a girl I've had chemistry with fucking sees me as just an incarnation of the dude she's no longer with (and is presumably no longer attracted to) and then forgets about me in a sexual way. This has happened with two girls in the past and one of them I've become best friends with and the other I can't really hang out with without getting attached to our flirting.

What does this mean? Perhaps that I make myself vulnerable to her or I lose my strong frame before she invests in me? This was a win for me as a whole because it's the first time that I was able to woo a girl I found attractive.

Also, I'm not mad at her, I don't ever, under any circumstances, slut shame women in my head or out loud. I've found that if I think of it in terms of her ""leading me on"", I can't help but get angry, but if I think of it as ""something that just happened"", I'm way more okay with it. I realized that girls will hook up with guys for any myriad of reasons, whether she wanted to get back at a guy or just have fun or whatever. I don't think she owes me anything, I'm just frustrated. I pretty much got over it but I indulged myself and asked my friend for more details and she told me that I got labeled as ""like her ex"" (my friend who acted as a messenger for me is also one of those girls who have told me that I remind her of her ex-boyfriend.)

To the topic. Last night, me, 2 guys and that girl I hit on last year (let's call her XYZ) went out to the bar. Those 2 guys often went out to smoke and I was 1on1 with XYZ several times. 

I noticed she wasn't feeling comfortable, so I told her I will not hit on her ever again, I know she might feel uncomfortable but I don't want to break contact with her, I want to keep her as a friend. Well, she blushed and got a little mad. Time passes by, guys come back, we talk about different things.

I was like, fine, whatever, I don't care, I don't have to explain myself. Aaaand she got a little more mad and kept telling me she doesn't believe me.

I simply took my beer and walked away from the table as guys came back. I went to the other room of the bar, I met another girl from my university group with her friend (24 F, hb 6/7) - long story short, we made out with HB at the end of the night.

You might think, what's all about that kino thing in the title. Well, XYZ is a type of girl, that doesn't allow anyone to touch her, not in the sexual way, but even in the friendly way. However, during the night and before going to the bar, she kind of kinoed on me - cute punches on my arm, pushing me or making me ""shut up"", we like to tease each other.

At the bar, she saw me hitting on that HB and today morning she pmed me on facebook, stating that I'm some kind of ladies man and kept asking me if I am going to date HB. Of course, I didn't give her any details about last night. Teased her a little bit and now I'm wondering if I should break any contact with that girl. Any thoughts on that?

&gt;I've heard the only surefire way of getting out of the ""friend-zone"" is to cut off all contact for an extended period of time. Is there any truth to this belief? Success stories?

&gt;If so, how long do you have to disappear? How do you disappear and still ensure you meet her again down the road, or is that not possible? For example, I'm asking this about a girl I've known for 6 years. I've dated other girls in that time, but she has always been constant presence in my life. I thought about remaining friends with her because she is legitimately a cool gal, but being around her fucks up the rest of my relationships (not intentionally).

&gt;So I've resolved to either get out of the friend-zone somehow, or to give her up. The latter might be difficult since I've known her for so long and she's pretty ingrained into my life, but I think it is time.

&gt;Any other viable routes on getting out of the friend-zone?

&gt;Edit -

&gt;@ [1] /u/PursueIt
Yes, I told her I wanted to be more than friends about 2 years ago. She didn't directly friend-zone me, but she did tell me she wasn't looking for a relationship at that point. I took it as a friend-zoning, but she also did get out of a really unhealthy relationship like 3 months prior to my confession.",,False,,t5_2s7xh,1359573257.0,,,True,t3_17kkha,http://www.reddit.com/r/askseddit/comments/17kkha/on_disappearing_moved_from_rseduction/,

This girl recently broke up with her bf and we're both really into each other. We just started having sex. Im pretty sure she wants to pursue a relationship, but shes hesitant. 

Shes told me that she wants to remain single for a year, but at the same time we're chalking up plans of rooming together. I believe her hesitation arises from how recently she broke up, she doesnt want to just jump from one guy to the next that quickly.

We joked about being friends with benefits, but she told me shes too loyal and would only see me. Ive told her multiple times that I'd be willing to be in a relationship with her, but that its up to her to decide what she wants to do. 

How do I convince her to be with me as gf/bf? IMO it seems like she wants it, but im a total newbie when it comes to this, thats why I'd like your input",,False,,t5_2s7xh,False,,,True,t3_17k72v,http://www.reddit.com/r/askseddit/comments/17k72v/how_do_i_turn_this_girl_into_my_girlfriend/,

I hosted a party 6 weeks ago and my friend and her hooked up. The next morning, turns out she'd picked up my number and started texting me. We've now texted every day without fail since, and met up once, whilst seeing each other in school every day. My friend has also been texting her after I encouraged him (before I realised I liked her) and is meeting up with her this weekend. This caused a big argument between me and him, and threatens our friendship if it doesn't get sorted out. 

Some important points:

1) She hasn't seen him since the party - he lives quite far away
2) If I'm 100% neutral me and my friend are similar, looks wise.
3) Me and the girl are 17, and heading off to uni in september, my friend is a year younger.
4) He thinks she doesn't like me, but I've heard from quite a few people she does.
5) He wants me to admit my attraction to her.



What do you guys think I should do? I really don't want to ruin my friendship with either of them, but really want to ask her out!

She's been asking to hang out all week and she gets excited when she sees me. *She actually just called me right as I was typing that sentence*.

I just haven't ever 'hit that' because I never really tried- I just kept it at flirting. 

**So should I treat tonight like a date and escalate in the movie theater?**

I'm a little worried that she'd be surprised.
