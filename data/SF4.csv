Alex and I tried several times to get together and record the interview, but out schedules were just too conflicting.  I decided to go with written answers, but Alex missed my e-mail mentioning that (my fault for not following up sooner about if he got the e-mail.)

So without further ado:


---------------------------------------------------------


* **#1 *""As such an experienced player, what are a couple notable flaws in the overall gameplay of so many newcomers to the fighting game scene?""* - by GuruPrimo**

Some flaws from the new generation of players are lack of fundamentals and simply being competitive. 

Fundamentals is the art of controlling space with your character through movement and attacks. You see many players today just trying to land combos on a skilled player but fail to create opportunities for them. This also goes for players throwing out fireballs at the worst times or always mashing DP when someone is near. Players should research/ask questions about their flaws to whoever they are losing to.

About lack of being competitive, there's a huge audience for SF today and I still see players being too scared, embarrassed, or just turned off from playing on streams and/or going to tournaments. Try not to be discouraged when things get uncomfortable, you'll gain more respect and knowledge every time you get back on the machine.


* **#2 *""Do you support fighting games getting frequent balance changes or do you think that they should be mostly left alone like they were in the past?""* - by Parallel_dinosaur**

Fighting game patches are fine but should be less frequent. Give the game time in the minds of millions and then balance the games out when there's a plateau.


* **#3 *""You have always been very vocal about people supporting local arcades and scenes, but what is your advice to people who live hours away from the closest arcade or scene, yet still wants to level up their game?""* - by Triox**

Wolfkrone/Latif live many hours away from their offline competition. They've dedicated their time into playing anybody online knowing the hardships it can bring to their game. I would suggest playing local matches online and test out your skills in a tournament nearest you. If things are looking good down the road, might want to consider playing vs any region online and traveling to out of state major tournaments. 


* **#4 *""Who are the top 3 underrated characters in AE and why?* - by marinkydink**

Thawk - does well all around vs the cast but moreso vs twins, zangief, shotos. I still don't think we're using this character to his full potential. See KOG's Thawk

Sakura - she has great pokes, mobility, and great pressure with her lk tatsu. Can escape and get in with air tatsus. I've seen some beast Sakura players out there and I think she will move up in tournament rankings. See Uryo's Sakura

Cody - he has great zoning tools and very damaging close range pressure. He's not an attractive character to play because of lack of mobility and probably character design, but he does put up great fights with the cast. See Sasaki,Sabre,Momochi.


* **#5 *""Do you think this year's unique results (Fuudo, Latif, Poongko) at Evo2k11 will affect the balance patch coming later this year?* - by Angelicxx**

The recent placings in EVO should mildly affect any balance changes imo. The Twins/Fei are the obvious advantageous characters in AE and I believe Capcom knew about this. By now, the AE2012 dev blogs should show the nerfs those characters are getting in an effort to make the game more balanced.

* **#6 *""As a main figure in the FGC, you've seen what works and what doesn't work when it comes to increasing the size of the community. What do you think is necessary for the FGC to reach mainstream status where everyday people will be able to put a face to the name ""Justin Wong"" or ""Alex Valle"" much like ""Kobe Bryant,"" and do you think it's something that we should strive for or just let happen with the natural growth of the sport?"" - by delicisousmeats**

First and foremost we need all the support we can get from fans that appreciate the game. Support can come from attending events, help promote and bring new players/spectators in, and of course starting your own scene. You don't necessarily have to be a top player to do this, all you need is a few friends that enjoy the games and want to increase awareness of the good times.


* **#7 *""What is your training schedule?* - by Fenor**

In my youth I practiced 8-10 hour days at the arcade 5-7 days a week. Today, I play(practice) about 1-2 hours a day 2-3 times a week. WNF is about 4 hours but its a tournament.


* **#8 *""There's been a trend lately in Capcom fighting games to make them more accessible to the general public, as in people outside the FGC, through things like comeback mechanics, like Ultras and X-factor, and the A-B-C-Launcher formula combos.* **

* ** *Obviously these things can only help casual play by making the games a little easier to play to unexperienced players, which means more sales for Capcom which means hopefully more support for fighting games in general. My question is how do you see this affecting high-level tournament play? And where do you see this trend going in the future?""* - by Universal_Man**

Gameplay has evolved from being very basic SF2 form to hardcore ST, 3s, or like CvS2. It's a very interesting decision for Capcom to simplify the games to reach a bigger audience while still managing to inject a little skill in the process. I think its a great choice because SF+ the audience both get a reboot in the series and we can possibly get challenging versions of the new generation games in subsequent releases.


* **#9 *""Do you have a plan for your retirement -- do you know what it would take to get you out of the game, or have a plan for when and how it might happen -- or do you plan to play 'til you drop? Personally I hope it's the latter, I'm a fan.""* - by NovaNox**

I don't plan to retire anytime soon. Retiring in video games sounds silly unless you completely lost interest or change lifestyles which is acceptable. Playing video games with my kids one day is something I look forward to so why stop?


* **#10 *You are one of the greatest projectile users in the FGC - what's going through your mind as you decide WHEN to throw a fireball, what strength and why?***

* ** *To put it another way, how do I shot fireball?""* - moodsteve**

A wise man aka John Choi told me to use FBs like a poke. Treat FBs as an extension of your normal move set. The hardpunch FB is your main poke tool that reaches outside your longest limb such as crouching hardkick. If you know the space where it's safe to throw fbs vs your opponent, then you can control the pace of the match most of the time. I use the light FB to change the pace or set my opponent up for anti air or close in distance for me to use my ground game. Be confident with your projectiles and see what works for you. There is no standard into throwing fbs, just smart stuff =)

As such, here's my idea.

I want to put together a video showcasing 3-5 BnB combo's **for the entire cast** with notations/breakdowns. I'm thinking the breakdown would look something like this, using Honda:

* Beginner combo - (cr.Short) &gt; cr.Jab xx HHS &gt; st.RH

* Intermediate combo - (Jump-in / Frametrap{) {cl.Fierce &gt; cr.Jab xx HHS {or} EX.Headbutt

* Advanced combo - (Jump-in) &gt; cr.Fwd xx EX.HHS &gt; cr.Jab xx HHS &gt; st.RH

* Character Specifics - Jewelman combo (With lists of who they work on etc).

* Pretty Combos (Possibly more character specrific) - Triple HHS on Gief/Hawk etc.

* **Edit**: Counterhit only combos - Can't think of any I use for Honda off the top of my head aside from going for easier EX HHS loops.

Format idea in post.,85,1,157,http://www.reddit.com/r/SF4/comments/17vosh/bnb_combo_thread_post_your_characters_bnbs_andor/,"[Check out this thread for why I'm asking for this information](http://www.reddit.com/r/SF4/comments/17vk9j/interest_check_bnb_combo_tutorial_for_the_entire/).

The thread title says it all - post some combos for your character(s) to give me a jumping off point for my video (or video series). Please try to keep this on topic and streamlined, if you want advice on any of these combos please PM the user that posted it. 

Feel free to post what you feel are corrections, extensions or optimizations of any combo someone posts here to try and arrive at the best possible combo we can pull together. 

Here's my example, for Honda. **I don't expect every post to have one of all of these, but please list if your combo is beginner, intermediate, etc etc.


* Beginner combo - (cr.Short) &gt; cr.Jab xx HHS &gt; st.RH


* Intermediate combo - (Jump-in / Frametrap{) {cl.Fierce &gt; cr.Jab xx HHS {or} EX.Headbutt


* Advanced combo - (Jump-in) &gt; cr.Fwd xx EX.HHS &gt; cr.Jab xx HHS &gt; st.RH


* Character Specifics - Jewelman combo (With lists of who they work on etc).


* Pretty Combos (Possibly more character specrific) - Triple HHS on Gief/Hawk etc.


* Counterhit only combos - Can't think of any I use for Honda off the top of my head aside from going for easier EX HHS loops.

Also, **please read the sidebar.** It has a TON of information about where to start. Check out shoryuken.com's forums about your character's BnBs and matchups.

I know /r/dota2 does something [similiar to this](http://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/1ik75p/hero_discussion_of_this_day_gyrocopter_18_july/) with their hero discussion.  I say once a week we make a post about 1-3 characters.  (39 characters + 5 from USF4 means 44 total charaters, so that's why we may have to do more than one a week so we can get to them all quickly.)  In the thread we can discuss things such as how to play the character, how to fight the character, why you think they should be nerfed/buffed, what's good/bad about them, etc.

Anyway, you guys interested?

First of all, let me start by saying I haven't played any fighting game EVER, and that this is my first I'm really interested in.

So, after watching some matches from EVO2013, I started to get interested in fighting games. I couldn't stop thinking about how cool it all is, so immediately the next day i bought a copy of Super Street Fighter 4 AE off Steam. I was so hyped that I was gonna be playing this amazing game in just 3 hours, I literally didn't do anything, besides finding out how to plug 2 PS3 controllers in my PC, so i just sat there for 3 hours, watching a line slowly move to 100%. When it was done, I was so happy i invited everyone in the house who had interest in playing video games (even though the only two people that were in the house at that moment was my 6-year old brother and 7-year old cousin). And there I was, sitting in front of my PC with 2 kids starting up SF4. We went straight to versus mode, and looked at the character select screen for 2-3 minutes. Finally i went for the standard pick, Ryu, while my cousin, went with Seth cause he seemed cool to him. And finally, it started! I had a quick look at what the controls were, and looked at some combos. As I was trying to pull of haduokens and shoryukens, my cousin just kept spamming heavy kick and punch. It was so annoying because I don't know how to counter that, and the kids just kept beating me. Then he told the heavy punch and kick to my brother, and he continued it too! Somewhere around 15 to 20 losses later i went to practice mode to continue practicing haduokens. My brother also was there and he saw me doing the blue fireball, and he begged me to teach him how to do it. After i thought him that, the cousin returned and we continued to fight. Now, a new threat emerged. My brother was now beating me AND my cousin by throwing endless haduokens at us. After a few losses my cousin got so mad they almost fought in real life. He pulled up a star wars lightsaber from my brother's toy stash and told my brother to stop using that move. After I made peace between my brother and my cousin, i went on to practice my moves more. I felt so proud that i learned all of Ryu's moves. i decided to check what was the online experience like. You probbably know what happens next. I got shitted on by some 2.5k pp Balrog that i didn't even damage because he blocked my every attack. That felt terrible. After that i went to try some trials, and got to level 13 on a few characters, after which i went to finally try Arcade mode. My god. I played on easy difficulty, and the first fight, THE FIRST FIGHT, i get crapped on by T.Hawk or something like that. Holy crap, I felt like shit. But i didn't give up, cause I know i can't get good just by playing for a couple hours. So i went back to training mode, practised for 2 hours, went back to arcade mode, and got to the 5th stage. I felt better already. SF4 is a really fun game that i want and will play more in the future, and is REALLY fun when played with friends!",,False,self,t5_2r4cj,False,,,True,t3_1ig53b,http://www.reddit.com/r/SF4/comments/1ig53b/my_first_time_playing_super_street_fighter_iv_and/,

Joshua Colon, who went by the handle SK (or sksksksksk222), was an extremely solid Rose player as well as an intelligent and kind guy who never had a bad thing to say about anyone.  He was a big contributor to SRK forums as well as a regular on Peaceful Jay's Stream and SRKLive.

He had a very bright future ahead of him that was snuffed out way too early.

Edit: He died from hitting his head after falling down from a sudden seizure. :(

Rest in peace, SK.

The games can be swapped to whatever people feel like playing that day, and we will do our best to stock alllllll the games. All i'm asking from you (you!) is to take my survey.

Here's how this will work:

* The top 10-20 upvoted questions will be answered by UltraDavid.

* 1 question per comment.

* No troll questions PLEASE. Please keep questions relevant.

I'll collect questions for the next two days or so. PLEASE DON'T JUST SUBMIT QUESTIONS, UPVOTE AS WELL! It's not going to do us any good to have 40 questions with only one upvote. He is answering the questions that we as a community vote on, so take a minute or two and upvote the ones you like.

For those who don't know him, UltraDavid is well known in the community for his snappy dressing, as a part of the dynamic commentary duo alongside James Chen and is an attorney that specializes in video game and entertainment law.

So when we think of our favorite matches that we think everyone should see, we all probably have different ideas. These are the matches you would show to people to say ""this is what Street Fighter 4 is all about."" I was thinking it would be neat if we compiled a list of the ""must see"" matches of all of Street Fighter 4's history, in case someone late to the game hasn't seen them or you just wanted to re-watch some good matches. I'll update this post with ones you guys think are good.

I'm trying not to have too many matches by the same people, but it's inevitable because the top players usually have such hype matches.

Hey street fighters! As you have probably already read in the title, this is the announcement post for the start of r/SF4's monthly tournaments!

The rules for said tournaments are as follows:

* US and Canada only (not if you are out in the boonies with shit internet though)
* Xbox only
* Best 2 out of 3 (finals are 3 out of 5)
* Double elimination
* Loser of a match my change character while winner may not (but you MAY change ultra)

The prize for the winner is custom flair and an 3 month Xbox live gold subscription.

Signups start RIGHT NOW and will end on Wednesday, April 24th. 8pm PST. Depending on how many people sign up, the deadline rules will change. Keep in mind that if you cannot complete at least one match a day, you will be disqualified.

The finalized rules will be available on april 24th, because right now I'm sick and can't really formulate much.

[Here is the signup link](http://challonge.com/tournaments/signup/lNq2KzoiqC)

Not everyone is poor, but the technology falls behind. I have a 2MB internet connection, and that's actually above average here to consume on a household.


I really love Street Fighter 4, its one of the reasons why I bought a PS3 (I was mostly a PC gamer but wanted to play on a console with a lot of players). I even bought a joystick. However, there really isn't a community here for it. It's mostly a mid-end PC (due to dota, lol &amp; cs:go) and PSP country here. Its quite rare for someone to have a PS3, also because everyone prefers buying mobile phones &amp; ipads instead. And its even rarer that there are people who have 360's. Those who do are probably playing them modified with pirated games, also for Wii's. If anyone is fortunate enough to play fighting games online, they're playing Tekken.



There's always a great deal of lag when playing online. For every 2 minutes of playtime there's 5-10 minute  of waiting and filtering for a good connection to play with. I main Bison, partly because I just like him but partly also because I can stomp/scissors spam when I'm experiencing lag.


With regards to arcades, I only know 2-3 places who have SSF4, and one of them is even modified (think a PS3 inside an arcade cabinet), with broken and loose pads most of the time. There's about 1-2 good players I meet every 3 months if everyone is playing at all. If there are any else, they're mostly beginner Ryus/Kens. However, the Tekken arcades are always well-maintained and jam-packed. I do play Tekken too but on a casual manner (I just got the plat on Tag 2 actually).


I really wish I can play a lot more and learn, even if I loose. I watch a lot of youtube videos and can only admire high competitive play, never really having a chance to try them personally.

**THERE HAS BEEN A CHANGE, CHECK THE MIDDLE OF THE POST**


ok dudes, let's do this thing.

Rules are as follows:


* Best 2 out of 3 (finals are 3 out of 5)
* Double elimination
* Loser of a match my change character while winner may not (but you MAY change ultra)

The tournament starts tomorrow (April 25th) at 6pm PST. you MUST I repeat **YOU MUST** join the IRC channel [(link here](http://chat.thinstack.net/?nick=&amp;channels=redditfighting)) under the  **NAME YOU SIGNED UP AS**. You will find your opponent and PM them your gamertag and do your matches. 

**You will have 15 minutes to do each of your matches before being DQd**

~~Once you have completed your matches one of you must PM me in the same IRC channel and tell me the outcome so I may record it.~~

**EDIT: It has come to my attention that when you are logged into challonge, you are able to report your own matches, this is how we are going to be handling it. When you match is done, have the winner go and record the scores. I will be mentioning this tomorrow before we start as well.**

As much as I would like to get this all done in one day, it may not be possible since there are 64 entrants. If it gets to that point, you must come back at the same time on friday to finish up.

I will be spectating all the finals matches so they can get uploaded to youtube after this is all done.

[Here's a link to the bracket.](http://challonge.com/av4kxvpq)

1366668744.0,42,self.SF4,1cw5s4,"With /r/SF4's first monthly tournament being XBL-only, I'm trying to gauge how much interest there is in a PC/GFWL monthly/weekly.",50,8,96,http://www.reddit.com/r/SF4/comments/1cw5s4/with_rsf4s_first_monthly_tournament_being_xblonly/,"I just feel those of us on PC are probably feeling kinda left out of the tournament fun right now (with PSN having weekly fight nights and now XBL having monthlies), I'd like to see if there's enough interest from /r/SF4's PC players to get an organized monthly or weekly event going.

I don't really have any number in mind of how many players is enough, but 10-15 in a single region/country would be good enough for me to get things started, at least for that region, anyway.

What I *could* provide in the way of resources:

* Brackets/bracket software
* Leagues (separated by, say, every 1000PP)
* Ladders, separated by anything you guys like - region, country, continent, etc.
* Player registration

What I *could not* provide in the way of resources:

* Streaming - my PC isn't nearly good enough for that
* YouTube match archives

Someone else (looking at you, Iodised Salt :) could do the streaming part, hopefully. Assuming this gets off the ground, this would be a great way to simultaneously level up almost the entire /r/SF4 PC community.

Feel free to leave comments/suggestions/constructive criticism or anything along those lines. Make sure to either leave a comment or PM me (if you prefer that, though I'd prefer a comment) if you'd like to see this happen.

**EDIT:** Thanks for the responses, everyone - this is going to become a reality! I'm currently trying to write down who wants to play, what region they're in, who's willing to stream, and stuff like that. Registration hasn't technically opened, but if you commented in this thread, I've gone ahead and written your name down ahead of time. To all you streamers who offered to help: I'll most likely be contacting you via PM so we can figure out a schedule that works for you guys.

If anyone's interested, here is the setup I currently have in mind:

* Weekly tournament, most likely taking place on a weekend.
* One special tournament at the end of every month. This will be the one with the flair prizes - thanks soulsynapse!
* North American and EU divisions. Transatlantic connections typically aren't that good, and since it seems like there's quite a few NA and EU players who'd like to play, I'd like to do this to give everyone the best connection possible.
* Ladders - keeping track of who has won what matches/tournaments, how many matches, against whom, and so forth.
* Hopefully both the weekly and the monthly tournament will be streamed. I'm currently trying to work out who will be streaming - I wouldn't be surprised if multiple people streamed at different times of the month.

All of this is up for debate, though - PM me if you'd like to see something changed/removed. I'll be making a registration thread as soon as I can work a schedule out with the streamers, which should hopefully take just a few days.

Remember, if you posted in this thread, I've already got your name down, so you technically don't have to post again. That said, some of you who posted in this thread don't have your region listed in your flair, so once I make a registration thread, I'll be sending off a PM to everyone who posted here but did not have their region listed.",,False,self,t5_2r4cj,1366739440.0,,mak,True,t3_1cw5s4,http://www.reddit.com/r/SF4/comments/1cw5s4/with_rsf4s_first_monthly_tournament_being_xblonly/,

I guess what I'm wondering is how much the subreddit would support the AMAs as fans.  It might be hard to convince some people to do them if it's only a handful of people asking questions and it looks like it's not going to be worth their time?

**Which way do you think would be best to do the AMA?**  Top 10 upvoted questions and they answer by a skype call?  Traditional AMA where the person asks questions in a thread at their leisure? Or let them decide which format they want to answer?

**Will we be able to refrain from troll questions?** (lol, have you ever seen a ghost).

**Would there be a problem if we asked them MvC3 questions also, or should we make /r/mvc3 do a seperate AMA?**

**Who would you like to see do an AMA?**  OK.  Right off the bat, I want to get people who are actually supporters of the community and are trying to make it better.  My list of people I want to ask right now are:

Alex Valle (because of all his work with the community)

Keits (because of his work with SRK)

Mike Ross (because of his work with Cross Counter)

Gootecks (because of his work with Cross Counter)

James Chen (because of his commentating)

UltraDavid (because of his commentating)



After that I would like to get interesting people like Wolfkrone (cause he's a player who got amazingly good while living in the middle of no where and almost no offline community to play with regularly) or other good SSF4 players.


Anyway, I've been wanting to do this for about 2 or 3 months now, but I never really got on the ball because of all the tournaments happening for the EVO circuit, then EVO itself.  Now that it's over, I thought it might be a good time to see about following though with my idea.

**Schedule**

* May 4th, 7PM EST for the NA division. The bracket for this is run by me.
* May 5th, 7PM GMT+2 for the EU division. The bracket for this will be run by /u/BvH91.

Be sure to be in the #redditfighting IRC channel (located on irc.thinstack.net) 15 minutes or earlier prior to the start of the tournament. There's a link to the web version of chatroom at the top of this subreddit, copy-pasted [here](http://chat.thinstack.net/?nick=&amp;channels=redditfighting) for your convenience, so you don't need to download any special IRC software or anything if you don't have any already/don't want to.

If this one goes well, this will hopefully become a weekly event.


**Registration**

***Registration is closed, I'll be posting the bracket soon.***

The current list of registered players is available [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Al_hUmO5kOXFdEQtTUJEak5HVHpfTzROdWV4UjdtVnc&amp;usp=sharing). While it's not possible to register any longer, feel free to PM me if there's any incorrect information or you'd like to be removed from the list.


**Streams**

The stream will be located on [twitch.tv/redditfighting](http://twitch.tv/redditfighting), and the streams will be provided by /u/rooozy (for the NA stream), and /u/BvH91 (for the EU stream). Thanks guys!

For everyone else who offered to stream, sorry about not getting back to you sooner. I've been real busy organizing this thing (I've probably sent over 80 PMs over the last two days), so I've sort of been in a press for time. If you'd like to stream the event next week, feel free to PM me, though I might not be able to respond for a little while.


**Bracket**

* [NA bracket, which *might* change in a few hours](http://challonge.com/reddit_pc_ae_weekly_1_na#)
* [EU bracket, which could change, but not likely](http://challonge.com/reddit_pc_ae_weekly_1_eu#)

**General info**


The tournament is run in the standard double-elimination format with best 2 out of 3 matches, the exception being winner's finals, loser's finals, and grand finals, all of which are best 3 out of 5. Like with most other tournaments, the player to come out of loser's finals must cause a bracket reset by winning one best 3 out of 5 set and then winning another one.

Counterpicking is also similar to most other tournaments - after each individual match in the best 2 out of 3 set, the losing player may counterpick with a different character, but either player may counterpick ultras at any time.

The matches are all run via endless lobbies, with one match per round being chosen to be streamed. This match is run in a 3-man lobby created by the streamer, who then invites the two players to the lobby.

Other matches are run in separate 2-man lobbies, where one player creates the lobby and then invites the other player - the player with the higher seed creates the lobby. Each match begins as soon as any prerequisite matches have finished.

After each non-streamed match, if the winning player has a Challonge account (the bracket will be hosted there), then that player can update the bracket themselves. Otherwise, the winning player contacts a TO (tournament organizer/operator) who then updates the bracket. For streamed matches, the streamer updates the bracket.

For each match, the competitors are notified what lobby they are supposed to join via IRC, as well as who is hosting it, as soon as any prerequisite matches have finished. 


**Other rules**

* Each player gets 10 minutes to join their respective lobby from the time the invite is sent. Failure to join the lobby inside the 10 minute time period results in an automatic loss. The player can contact a TO to get an additional 5 minutes if need be. This timer starts as soon as the aforementioned IRC notification to that player is sent.
* Each player should be in the #redditfighting IRC channel at least 15 minutes before the start of the first round, and should stay in the channel until the end of the tournament. Failure to comply with this rule counts as a no-show and results in an immediate disqualification.",,False,self,t5_2r4cj,1367588212.0,,mak,True,t3_1dfy2l,http://www.reddit.com/r/SF4/comments/1dfy2l/reddit_pc_ae_weekly_tournament_info_is_here/,

1365434088.0,37,self.SF4,1bx65b,Attending my first Tournament; here's my experience,43,6,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/SF4/comments/1bx65b/attending_my_first_tournament_heres_my_experience/,"Ok so I went to Zone Out at local battles in NJ. I live right around the corner so I said fuck it, let's go. It was AWESOME. I had such a blast. From casuals all the way to the actual tournament, I had a lot of fun. I didn't fare too well (double elimination, lost both my first games). I have some tips, advice, and what not that I'd like to share with this sub, too:

1. **Show up early and get casuals in**. Many of the pros that showed up to the tournament showed up late. I saw Moons, Native, FNEX Madness, Dieminion, Drewsprite and Chris G. I didn't recognize a few people but I heard they were there like Sanford Kelly. There were some amazing no names that showed up, too. I got to play a TON of casuals beforehand and that's important. Not only is it a good way to warm up but you can talk with your opponent and ask what you're doing wrong and what's going on. I can't stress how important casuals are.

1. **Talk to your peers**. this was my first tourney and EVERYONE was helpful. Everyone wanted to help me out. I met FNEX Madness and he told me that I could ask him anything about Adon! I know have a professional hookup for when I need help with my main! He gave me tips on the spot just because I went up and asked him about his matches. Also, Native is awesome in person, nice kid. Moons is super cool. Basically, don't be shy and talk to peeps because chances are, they're really nice. 

1. **Don't feel bad if you lose**. I lost real quick but my buddies that I went with talked me through my loss (they were watching) and then I talked to the guy that beat me and asked him what I did wrong. I played Drewsprite first and then Moons afterwards. Got bodied lol. Drewsprite gave me some advice on how to improve my game. It was a great learning experience and I definitely gained from my loss. 

1. **Don't forget to eat/drink.** Very important to stay hydrated. I ended up buying a bottle of water or two. The place was kinda cramped after awhile. Oh and brush your teeth/shower beforehand. Please. 

That's all I got for now. Definitely, if you haven't already, get in touch with your tournament scene in the area. It's so worth. My buddies and I are gonna try to go everytime there's a tournament there. It should be great!

I know they get some hate for not taking commentary seriously, but they are both very knowledgeable and technical.

I watch all the Big Two footage that Teamspooky puts on Youtube and can't get enough of them. Best commentating team in the FGC in my opinion.

Since there have been quite a few offer sales with the game recently I thought i'd share some modding tips that some of you might not be aware of, especially the new players. These are things that i generally use, you may contribute with your own tricks.

*****

SIMPLEST INSTALLATION METHOD:

*****

This is a general and very essential tip, since I know most people fear tampering with the game files because of the risks involved (breaking the game and having to reinstall). Fear not though, there is a method of installing mods that has virtually no risks!

The bulk of gameplay files (models/sounds/stages) are located in the **SSF4AE\resource** folder, however we never have to deal with it (not even having to back it up). Instead we will use the **SSF4AE\patch_1_07** folder which is the main folder we'll have to deal with for mods installation.

As long as similar directory and file structure is held, files in **SSF4AE\patch_1_07** will override the original files from **SSF4AE\resource\**.

This is a general method of installation for all mods, provided it mods files from the \resource directory. Most mods installation instructions will not state this method since it's more of a recent finding, so they'll ask you to replace the original files which is not to be desired!

I hope the following example is clear enough.

Example (with a [custom lifebar](http://augh.deviantart.com/art/SSF4-AE-Retro-health-bars-296273820) modification):

1. Backup the **\patch_1_07** folder (it does contain a few unique files on its own)

2. The mod's readme.txt says we need to install in **\resource\battle\hud\CMN** but we know better!

3. Open the \patch_1_07\ folder and create **\patch_1_07\battle\hud\CMN** directory structure (if it's not already present)

4. Extract the lifebar file **cockpit.tex.emz** to \patch_1_07\battle\hud\CMN

5. Done! \patch_1_07\battle\hud\CMN\cockpit.tex.emz will override the original lifebar \resource\battle\hud\CMN\cockpit.tex.emz

6. When we get tired of this mod or simply don't like it, we delete the \patch_1_07\battle\hud\CMN\cockpit.tex.emz file and the original will no longer be overriden by the mod.



*****

INTERFACE CHANGES:

*****

* Replacing the Main Menu background because who is really a fan of Ryu kissing Ken?

Here are some great main menu backgrounds: http://augh.deviantart.com/gallery/?q=ssf4+menu

I personally use [this one](http://th03.deviantart.net/fs71/PRE/i/2012/106/0/b/ssf4_ae_akuma_menu_by_augh-d4we2l4.jpg)!

* Removing unnecessary intros. I don't like having to skip all those intros and movies.

Simply rename or delete (i recommend renaming) the movie files in these 2 folders:

**SSF4AE\movie\opening**

**SSF4AE\movie\nvidia**

* Replacing lifebars

Here are a couple of custom lifebars (I personally prefer Retro):

http://augh.deviantart.com/art/SSF4-AE-Retro-health-bars-296273820

http://augh.deviantart.com/art/SSF4-AE-Smooth-health-bars-296274410

*****

MUSIC MODS:

*****

* Silencing the Main Menu music (I like to leave the game open, but the looping music gets really annoying)

Copy the file **\resource\ui\sound\se\MAIN_SE.csb** to **\patch_1_07\ui\sound\bgm\BGM_MAIN.csb**

* Announcer mod to say ""Super Street Fighter 4 Arcade Edition"" at the title screen (right now it says just ""Super Street Fighter 4"", doesn't feel proper :D)

http://aemods.pbworks.com/w/page/41166311/music#AnnouncermodtosayArcadeEditioncreditJayVasquez77

* Custom music. Sorry, I don't dabble with custom music since I happen to like the default tracks. Maybe someone else could chip in.

*****

STAGES:

*****

* Replacing Volcanic Rim or other annoying backgrounds with the Bonus stages

http://i.imgur.com/RHMXc.jpg

http://i.imgur.com/t3FG6.jpg

Extensive guide here: http://www.reddit.com/r/SF4/comments/ybbr4/pc_bonus_stages_as_regular_stages/

* Aesthetically simplified backgrounds (I use Cloudy Evening At The Old Temple. It removes the distracting pedestrians and adds a moodier cloudy sky: http://i.imgur.com/UUifs.jpg)

http://aemods.pbworks.com/w/page/44880364/Stage%20Mods#SimplifiedStages

* Performance simplified backgrounds (replaces 3D stages with static 2D backgrounds, this is for people with slower computers that still want to see something in the background because disabling stages from the video options results in a pitch black background. This is a great workaround without taxing the hardware.)

*****

CHARACTER MODS:

*****

I recommend these places for characters mods:

http://aemods.pbworks.com/w/page/41162160/character%20select (collection of mods throught the time, not very updated, but a good place to start)

http://shoryuken.com/forum/index.php?threads/ssf4ae-pc-custom-skin-thread.140225/ (discussion between modders, here you can find about the latest mods)

*****

GAMEPLAY MODS:

*****

This is fairly uncharted territory for me since gameplay mods break online compatibility, UNLESS both players have the same gameplay modifications installed.

I can somewhat recommend SF4 Remix (http://www.sf4remix.com/) since I've seen it on a stream with JWong and FLoe. It seemed pretty fun and not extremely wacky. More details on their website.

Maybe someone is having a hard time with a match up and that's why they put something 7-3 when you think it's 5-5.  Instead, offer suggestions instead of criticism.  if you can't offer suggestions, then STFU and don't post.

2.) Obviously, a full list of every character would be awesome, but if you don't want to do the full thing, then post whatever.

Hi everybody, in the last few weeks there's been some talk about updating the subreddit, so far the mod team has been largely hands off and its worked out more or less fine for everyone involved but we figured its about time to update a few things. Here's whats on the table:

1. **Redirecting /r/streetfighter.**

    The previous owner handed the subreddit off to us about a week ago, the consensus of the mod team is to redirect it to /r/SF4 but to do that (and alert the subscribers) we need some help from you guys to make sure they see it. ~~Tomorrow we'll be making a post both here and there, so please lend us your aid.~~

2. **CSS improvements.** (ex: /r/starcraft /r/leagueoflegends /r/music)

    We're looking to update the CSS on the subreddit a bit and we'd like input from everyone on what they would like to see. A good place to start are the subreddits above, please take ideas from those (or other) subreddits and think of how we could get them to work for /r/sf4.

3. **Wiki and community projects.**

     We think that the [BnB project](http://www.reddit.com/r/SF4/comments/18ur0o/bnb_combos_thread_addendum_fill_in_the_holes/) and the [character specific combo project](http://www.reddit.com/r/SF4/comments/1ak8tt/idea_character_specific_combosmixups_thread/) have gotten big enough that they warrant their own pages. If the original creators of the threads feel they're up for the task, we can assign specific pages for them to be able to edit and update as they see fit. We'd also like to welcome other projects, for those that would care to do them. Just make a post about it to get some attention / subreddit consensus and message the mods and we'll see what we can do. We'll also be combining a lot of the stuff on the sidebar into wiki pages, FAQs and the like.

Ok so I started playing SF4 about a month ago. I watched Daigo's stick tutorial and I started holding the stick like him. Thinking I was a bad ass now I didn't think anything more of it. A month later i'm still struggling with inputs even going as far as changing my gate. Then today I watched this video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NvS4bwocJk and just facepalmed.

This whole time I've been using my entire arm to move the stick. I just tried relaxing only using my fingers to do inputs after watching that video and it just made a world of difference. Inputs are so much easier now omg.

I however see it differently and see it as a positive thing.

One thing is that they are still sticking with SF4 and haven't forced us to move onto SF5. Because of this, with any edition of SF4 you have, it's still pretty much the same game.

The next thing to look at is to think of it as preserving the game's player base. By releasing a new edition of Call of Duty each year, the game's players become a fractured one. I think what makes the FGC special is that they are able to hold onto the same game for YEARS. I mean people still play SF2 to this day. We had a huge turnout of EVO for Smash Bros., a game that's more than 8 years old.

I feel that **expansion packs** are better than straight up releasing sequels because you are able to retain your audience; you don't create a situation where half of your players play the older game and the other half plays the newer one. I also see more and more posts about new players getting into SF4 after EVO, which is a good thing for the game.

So I'm excited to see how the new characters add to the game: Elena, Rolento, Poison and Hugo. I'm also wondering what the new balance changes are going to be.",,False,self,t5_2r4cj,1374268134.0,,guile,True,t3_1in7f4,http://www.reddit.com/r/SF4/comments/1in7f4/how_does_rsf4_feel_about_ultra_sf4/,

It takes place during the vanilla SF4 days and follows Justin wong, Li Joe, mike ross, and gootecks the most. It also has interviews and footage of many different players.

also be warned it is on hulu so there are quite a few ads.

* **There will be no option to disable gems in SFxT. Ono said they're too important to the gameplay.**

* **Not all gems in SFxT will be opened up from the get go, DLC and other stuff will make more of them available. There will be a starter set available right out of the gate.**

Gems can't be turned off, and many gems will be available as DLC. This is NOT a good combination, as it turns from pay to play to pay to win.

This shit has reached fighting games.

I've been speaking with Paul ""Koogy"" Kugler for a short while now about getting an AMA going and he's really interested. For those of you who don't know what BROKENTIER is, it's (in the most basic sense) an independent clothing line based on arcade / fighting game culture. For some more information on BROKENTIER and Koogy, [click this link to be taken directly to their website!](http://www.brokentier.com/pages/about)

BROKENTIER's success really shows what happens when you take your passion to the next level and is one of the best examples of ""from the community for the community"". Koogy and his staff aren't in this for money; they funnel a TON of their profit back into the community through individual player sponsorship, event sponsorship and countless other ways.

Please, use this opportunity to really learn from someone who turned their love of fighting games into something like this. It really goes to show what passion and drive can do.

1340693342.0,28,self.SF4,vm9y3,How I found the will to keep playing after being beat down almost every match. (words for new players),31,3,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/SF4/comments/vm9y3/how_i_found_the_will_to_keep_playing_after_being/,"So I've played the game for a while and only got online recently. After many hours in arcade mode I had settled on Juri as my main and could not wait to test my skills online. After about a dozen matches or so, I realized I was not as good as I initially thought, sucked even. 

After the numerous disheartening losses, I looked online for information on Juri. Turns out I'd been playing her completely wrong. After learning what rushdown, zoning, etc. meant, I came back to the game with a new sense of confidence, ready to give out some cans of whoop-ass. Unfortunately the only person getting said cans was me.

So once again I traveled to the magical land of the interwebs to find some more answers on why I sucked. Having done much more research than just character types, I had found numerous combo videos for Juri, videos detailing what matchups were good for her, and other little tricks for SF4 in general. Once again I felt a new found courage to go online. 

Yeah again I still sucked but the point is, I knew WHY I sucked. Instead of throwing my stick out the window with rage, I was thinking about what I was doing wrong with my tactics, character matchups, and uses for my ultras. The game is infinitely more interesting once you know the specifics of everything instead of playing in a fog of ignorance. I seriously recommend that any new player who is frustrated with how they perform, and don't know exactly why they suck, go look up anything and everything about the characters they play. It helped me stick with the game, learn more, as well as actually enjoy it. 

Now that I (sort of) know what I'm doing I've actually won a few matches. ~300BP with Juri and ~150PP overall. It isn't much, but hey, you have to start somewhere.

TL;DR I sucked, now I don't. Thanks internet.

1345732326.0,26,self.SF4,yp3fe,"Newbie Guide - Life Leads, Controlling Space, and Making the Most Out of Opportunities",29,3,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/SF4/comments/yp3fe/newbie_guide_life_leads_controlling_space_and/,"I was going to use this in reply to ""Newbie Mistakes"" thread but I realized I wasn't really talking about mistakes as much and I didn't want to de-rail the thread. 

I am going to talk about life leads since this is something my character, e honda, very heavily relies on. I feel very safe and in control of the match when I have a life lead - but even when I am behind I try to remember it only takes one pixel of health to win - I try not to panic. You just have to make sure you make good use of all 99 seconds and avoid being overly risky until it is absolutely inevitable. 

when you have a big life lead, it is so important to relax on your aggression. eating a free ultra will even things out or even make you lose. you have to think - if you have a massive life lead, a lot of players feel on edge and they will need to do something desperate to get back in the game - these are usually the most obvious chances to punish. 

when you have a life lead, there is absolutely no reason to jump in unsafely. An obvious jump in is probably the easiest way to eat an ultra in the game. a lot of times you can jump in if they make a bad jump, you hit them basically right as they are landing they have to just block it - you have to take every chance you can to at least get chip damage! there are other openings that will become really obvious to you and you have to take those chances to at least chip too! dont waste any of these chances. 

A lot of players have a really good understanding of space and frame data so if a situation looks unfamiliar to you - they are jumping up and down or whiffing a certain move repeatedly - be very careful- it could be a trap. sometimes its good to just take the hit and learn exactly HOW they can punish you and from what distances and with what moves. 

when I say you should relax on aggression - that doesn't mean just sitting there holding down back. I find a lot of players will sit there and whiff a command grab or just throw fireballs etc. in order to build super meter. You want to try and keep them from doing this in a SAFE way. 

So what I like to do in this situation is try and SAFELY close space on them and back them into the corner - so walking forward, being VERY careful not to eat pokes- this means projectiles too! You don't want to be walking forward in an obvious pattern. i.e. dont block for 2 seconds, then walk forward for 1, over and over again, maybe block for 2, walk for .5, block for 10, walk for 2, etc. mix it up so its not too obvious. Try and get a feel for when they like to throw THEIR pokes out too to maximize your walking distance. This is the best chance to use your pokes too - if you can figure out their walking pattern, the ideal time to hit with normal pokes is the frame that the enter into your space, giving them absolutely no time to throw out a poke of their own and counter. 

Once they are in the corner, you have now eliminated the option for them to jump back, walk back, and dash back - three less options to worry about! A lot of thier moves might be unsafe now because you are effectively controlling the entire space. Now the ball is in their court to make a move and they are going to be tempted into doing something unsafe that you can punish and hopefully close out the round. 

If it is the last round and I am massively ahead, and the clock is below 40 seconds - I normally just sit there holding down back for the most part - I'll let them kill the clock and build their meter. Chances are they won't get to use it all before the fight is over anyway as they are going to have to do something drastic to get back in the game. You don't want to risk losing too much life that late in the game by eating pokes walking forward too much. But just sitting there - you are being kind of obvious in a way - you dont want to let them get into a position where they can hit you with an overhead or throw! You have to retreat right away if you can sense danger.

One issue you will run into is people using shoryukens etc and cancelling them with full bar, baiting you into attempting tech throws - its normally better to just guess ""block"" instead of tech throw because you can't combo a throw into an ultra but you definitely combo FADC'd special moves into ultras! That is the danger of letting someone build a full meter with lots of time left. Ultimately this guessing game is going to have to come down to experience and foresight because you also don't want to eat three throws in a row either and your opponent may catch on to your thought process.

If the life meters are starting to even out again, you can't be giving up that valuable space! One of the biggest mistakes I see players do is right at the beginning of the match, they walk/dash back or jump backwards! Why?!?!? You are basically just showing the other player you are afraid of them and you are effectively limiting your options right off the hop. 

The game revolves around opportunities - think about the speed of your character, the amount of health they have, the amount of damage they do, the moves they have, these attributes allow for more or less opportunities. You need to think about how your character fits into this model and play accordingly in order to utilize those opportunities the best way you can.

Fuck that. Strictly not for profit, but ready to promote this subreddit for the better opportunity. 

Once again let me reiterate that I am not in it for the money. I want you guys to succeed, without investing a dime.

I'm offering $50 to the first place winner with a 15 person minimum tournament. Everything will be streamed, and this will be a great opportunity to show off your skills to the public, and show there are a lot more people in the scene that can take on the pros with flying colors.

Drunk at 1 pm ? Perhaps. I am surprised rsf4 hasn't gone far in the fgc public, but I am ready to show off the skills and madness of you people on this great private community, and I know you have the balls and abilities to make yourself known. And you deserve it coughVESERIUScough.

Please, if there is any confusion or questions. Feel free to contact me via reddit or irc.

I want to do this for you guys add a token of my appreciation for keeping me sane during my darkest days. Sometimes people don't know when they affect someone's life, but I sincerely love this community and will do anything to keep you guys playing.

Apologies for the rant, just want you all to know you are appreciated and I will do something about it.

**Him:** You really aren't close to good enough to be judging anyone's game. That wasn't even my main. I'd beast you.

*(While I'm certainly nothing special, I did eat sleep and breathe SF for many years in the past. I feel like I'm a crafty old guy of sorts. Execution and reflexes might be shot, but mental game and my poke/footsies are still sharp!)*

**Me:** Hey, I seriously wasn't trying to gloat or anything like that, just thanking you for a good match and making a little conversation. Anyway, take care.

**Him:** Whatever, scrub.

*(Now I'm amused. I mean, I think I've gone out of my way to be decent here.)*

**Me:** A scrub who beat you =)

*(I guess I hit a nerve there because I totally wasn't expecting what came next.)*

**Him:** That's hilarious. I regularly play competitively, in-person with [Insert every ""name"" player on the East Coast and more]. You're nowhere near my level. You're nobody. Where do you live? Why don't you come see and we'll see what's up. You don't know the first thing about this game...

It doesn't end, it just goes on and on and on. He's giving me his whole resume, referencing frame data and demanding to know who I am. 

The name dropping is particularly amusing as some of them are folks I've known since the late 90s, before they were Internet famous. People who I sent pictures of my newborn kid to long after I stopped playing.

I just ignore it and go about my business.

Several **weeks** later I'm fooling around online doing randoms trying out Gen for the first time and lose a match. Instantly...

**Him:** Yeah scrub, that's right. I told you I'd beast you. Fucking scrub. NYC!

1374992721.0,24,self.SF4,1j7e3x,My Achievement Of 1000 PP/BP; My Journey In Street Fighter,30,6,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/SF4/comments/1j7e3x/my_achievement_of_1000_ppbp_my_journey_in_street/,"Hello, r/SF4!

My name is Guy Connor Lester, aka ""Ridill"" (among other things...) and although I have been playing various fighting games my whole life, I've recently decided I want to be a competitive SF4 player. I've done various competitive gaming (mostly Super Smash Bros. Melee), and am also a competitive Magic: the Gathering player... but I wanted to get into this game in a big way after watching Evo 2k13. (Yes, part of the baby boom that it created.)

I just kind of wanted to write down my thoughts on being a new player in a competitive light, and I thought my recent achievement of 1000 BP/PP would be a good stopping point to kind of write everything down. This may be a boring read for some or most of you, but I appreciate all who read onward.

After following SF a bit pre-Evo (the hype was getting to me), I decided I couldn't miss watching it, even if I didn't understand much. After Evo finished, I couldn't help but feel like I wanted to be a part of this. So, I dusted off my PS3 version of AE, bought it on Steam (sale was going on!), and broke into it. 

I built a custom stick using the shell of a MCZ TE SC5, and instantly felt much better (I've played a lot of arcade games, such as shmups and the like, so a stick has always felt better than a controller regardless). With the advice of this Subreddit, I started with Ryu, and went straight into training. 

After hours (that turned into days) practicing small combo's (such as cr. forward into fireball) and focusing on fundamentals, I spread out a little bit. 

I've always been the kind of person to ignore tier lists, in any regard; I play by feeling. The way I see it, playing with feeling is just as important as it is to play with your hands, and head. I just wait until something clicks, and then I just know.

Well, for better or worse, that character was Oni. So I've been playing him ever since. After watching [The Book of Oni](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKrTeuGKK78) more than I could count throughout each day (huge shoutouts to you, mMm!), I was always eager to get home, get into the training room, and try new things with Oni.

At first, after focusing on fundamentals, I jumped online. Outcome? I got my ass fucking HANDED TO ME. Didn't win a single match in an hour. So, I jumped back into training mode for another few days to level up some more.

As time progressed, I was able to execute my combo's more consistently (mainly just The Loop and his BnB's). My reaction time became much quicker. I was able not only to get visual reads on my opponents, but also able to see into how they were playing each match, and react to it.

I started winning. Not a lot, mind you, but I actually started winning, just playing with the basic fundamentals, and punishing with BnB's, and not actually dropping them every time... I felt like I leveled up. Such an amazing feeling.

Before I knew it, today I went on a winning streak, even winning 5 times in a row at one point, to reach 1000 PP / BP. Now, I know, BP/PP doesn't really mean much, nor does beating your opponent necessarily, it's all about your execution and practice so that you can beat the guy sitting next to you at your next tournament. 

However, I feel really good about what I've achieved in my short time playing. I feel like progress is being made. Every time I hit a wall, I plowed through it and just kept going. I will keep going. 

Thanks all for reading, ask any questions or leave any comments below... this community has helped me infinitely more than I can imagine to help you all. My GFWL ID will be in my flair for anyone that wants to spar. PEACE!

PS. 
Might as well do some shameless self promoting while i'm here. I'm starting a 'Road to Evo 2k14' as kind of a personal goal and have started Streaming my play often. If you ever feel like watching some SF, playing games on stream, or critiquing while I play to help me along, I'd really appreciate it. My twitch is [HERE] (http://twitch.tv/RidillSF). I tweet when I'm going live @CelShaded.


tl;dr I'm really excited about my future within this community and game.",,False,self,t5_2r4cj,1374993051.0,,oni,True,t3_1j7e3x,http://www.reddit.com/r/SF4/comments/1j7e3x/my_achievement_of_1000_ppbp_my_journey_in_street/,

Anyway, I'm going to take a nap. Post here so I can gauge your reaction and advance accordingly. I'll be back in a few.

UPDATE (1): Alright, I just woke up and I do see that the idea is exciting enough to consider. However, there are a few questions that do need to be answered.

1. For all intents and purposes, this will most likely be a 360 tournament. This is due to the sheer number of those who play on the 360. If there is enough asking for it, then there will be a PS3 and PC tournament as well. For now, consider this 360 only.

2. This tournament is mainly for those who live in North America. Those who reside in the 7 North American Time Zones (Hawaii, Alaska, Pacific, Mountain, Central, Eastern, Atlantic) will be catered to the most. If enough demand is for it, then a separate tournament for a different continent shall be considered.

All that said, the tournament will most likely be held tomorrow, with signups starting tonight. The short signup period will ensure a lower no-show rate, which is a problem which has plagued several online tournaments in the past.

Stay tuned for more updates and a link.

UPDATE (2): Sign-up Page is here: http://challonge.com/tournaments/signup/jnus4b7nfa

Please read the overview thoroughly.

Remember, this sign-up will only be up for about 23 hours. So don't delay.",,False,self,t5_2r4cj,True,,gief,True,t3_kmq2s,http://www.reddit.com/r/SF4/comments/kmq2s/im_thinking_about_organizing_an_online_tournament/,

* What day and time frame work best for you?
* How often (weekly, biweekly, monthly)?
* How big should the lobby be? How many rounds per game?
* I would really like this to be geared towards beginners because I'm pretty bad and find it hard to learn from complete ass whoopings, but how does everyone else feel?
* I'd really like to incorporate feedback and advice into this somehow, maybe by making a post the day after in which players can ask questions or provide feedback based on the games they played the night before.

installation notes: extract the .rar in ""SSF4AE\resource\battle\stage""

you can also replace any other stage with them, but it requires some basic Hex editing:

example to replace Volcanic Rim:

1. extract one of the two modified bonus stages somewhere

2. open the 2 stage files (STG_TRN.tex.emz &amp; STG_TRN.emz) in a HEX editor

3. search &amp; replace TRN with VCN (match case)

4. rename STG_TRN.tex.emz &amp; STG_TRN.emz into STG_VCN.tex.emz &amp; STG_VCN.emz

5. copy these renamed files to ""SSF4AE\resource\battle\stage"" (make sure you made a backup first)

The location was a Bavarian inn and instead of the people participating in a tournament there was free beer, food and Ono and Harada doing a battle that consisted of hammering nails into wood, throwing brezels and so on. It was mad hype and during one of the breaks I fistbumped with Harada on the toilet.

So, about the game:

There was no tournament, just two freeplay stations that we could access after Ono's and Harada's battle. We all agreed on best of three matches and began playing. We had a build with all so far announced characters. I got to play around 20 matches and watched around 200 matches.

Some of my impressions/things I noticed:

* Raven had/has no dash in this build. Don't know if that was a bug or wanted since he has pretty godlike dash moves that let your opponent guess if it's going to be a cross up or not. Probably best compared to Oni in AE.

* Yun fans can rejoice: Julia has the f.HP, shoulder, upkicks, Lunge punch, she felt just like Yun except for the missing divekick (but still with a good j.HK that combos).

* Hugo is a beast. Probably due to our knowledge in 3S we figured him out the most that day. He has crazy wallbounce air grab combos that do tons of damage.

* Dhalsim has a fucking fast jump but alas his limbs are not chainable ala Alpha.

* The Tekken players that were at the event found crazy ground bounce combos with Steve and Hwoarang that dealt massive damage. I think that Tekken Bnbs probably work in this game. Not sure how else they found out so fast. :D

* Kuma seemed pretty weak at first. His dash went only a really short distance and he seemed free against everybody who can zone.  Then we found out that he heavily relies on his roll move, even more than Abel does in SF4.

* Talk about dashes: the Tekken characters who had good dashes could cancel their dashes into ... dashes. Wave dashing without the crouching! This combined with complete fireball invulnerability made them pretty godlike against fireball characters. I already heard that capcom is aware of this and is going to nerf them though.

* Raven has ground and air projectiles!

* The cross assault (the special where you play both of your characters at once) will in my opinion become what makes this game fucking fantastic. At the end of the day me and a few of my buddies already did some crazy shit that just bounced the opponent back and forth nonstop.

* Marduk has potential but it has yet to be unlocked I guess. :P

* Ken and Kazuya are best friends. To me they felt like the most complete team that day.

* Meter building off whiffed moves was random in this build. Some characters like Hugo had no meter building off whiffed moves and others like I think Yoshimitsu and Raven had seemingly random amounts of meter built through whiffed moves (Seth pointed out though that this is just a glitch in the current build as far as I heard).


All in all it was a freaking awesome event and I really like the game now even though I didn't like it before I played it. Seth Killian, Ono and Harada are incredibly well mannered, funny guys that make the fighting game community a better place.

So far with about 6 hours of XBL I managed 2k pp 3k BP with Evil Ryu on a fresh account ( Satsui No Ryu ), managing to play with some real killers along the way. However the Shinjuku Taito station has been a slightly different story, been getting my ass kicked. I have been managing to play toe to toe with all of the player base, it's just a mix of a few things that's been killing me, mostly match up knowledge basically I need more and they know what Evil Ryu does XD.

Sad news is the luggage Handlers are rough on the trip here and my recorder got destroyed :( no stream no youtube videos.

On a slightly strange and funny note, at the arcade you'll see two things the traditional Japanese ( Salary man ) playing Akuma like a miniature Tokido kicking your ass, as well as a list of names fit for Evo top 8; however, more surprisingly you'll  see that same roster of top players often losing games to said salary men.

PS, Umehara gives away free games if his last train is announced when you are playing him so he can get his BP card and leave XD.

Finally if you guys are interested, I'll keep you updated on my adventure in the land of the Rising shouryu!",,False,self,t5_2r4cj,1376791699.0,,ryu,True,t3_1kkv9i,http://www.reddit.com/r/SF4/comments/1kkv9i/japan/,

1341219590.0,22,self.SF4,vx16k,A friend bought me the AE from the pc version sale two days ago. I really want to learn but holy crap this is a DEEP game genre.,22,0,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/SF4/comments/vx16k/a_friend_bought_me_the_ae_from_the_pc_version/,"My fighting game background can be listed on one hand. Killer Instinct: Gold, Dead or Alive 3, Soul Caliber 2, and the Smash Bros. series. I'm fully aware that smash bros don't constitute as normal fighters but they are still strategy games with a dexterous input.

That being said, I never got good enough to win local tourney's in any of those games and most of them are 10+ years old now, so you may be able to imagine how long I've been out of the loop.

I got the game less than 72 hours ago and I've spent at least 20 of them reading and watching youtube videos. I really want to get better but I can't seem to find out how to start identifying what I'm bad at and where my mistakes are. (there are just so damn many) Obviously I'm not winning many online matches. The few I am winning are with hakan. Not sure if he is just rare enough that people don't know how to fight against his moves or if I'm actually getting proficient with him.

Again, my real problem is just trying to find out what I need to learn. Obviously spending a good amount of time in the training room and fighting cpu's will give me a bit of character mastery. But being able to pull off staple combo's will not win me many matches. I need to figure out how to learn what to do when the opponent is using X. I was putzing around with zangief against a friend in skype and he showed me that I could lariat at the right time to ""dodge"" his fireballs. My mind was blown out of my skull. Then he had me use his green flaming backhand move ( I forget the name sorry) to advance toward him while ""smacking"" the fireball to dissipate it. Again, I was baffled and perplexed because how could I have ever found that out through normal play?

I don't know the correct course of action right now. As of right now I'm trying to find a few characters to spend my time on. I'm hoping by narrowing down the field of moves to master I can get better more quickly and learn the nuances of each moveset both offensively and defensively. But with the vast breath and depth of the game I don't feel like I even know what questions I should ask so I can get better.
