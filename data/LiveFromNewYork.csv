1351980646.0,69,self.LiveFromNewYork,12l0x6,Mass email from Louis CK about tonight's show - pretty lovely. ,77,8,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/LiveFromNewYork/comments/12l0x6/mass_email_from_louis_ck_about_tonights_show/,"Hello. Its louis here. I'm clacking this to you on my phone in my dressing room here at studio 8H, right in 30 rockefeller center, in Manhattan, new york city, new york, america, world, current snapshot of all existence everywhere. 

Tonight I'm hosting Saturday Night Live, something I zero ever in my life saw happening to me. And yet here it is completely most probably happening (I mean, ANYTHING could NOT happen. So we'll see). 

I've been working here all week with the cast, crew, producers and writers of SNL, and with Lorne Michaels. Such a great and talented group of people. 

And here we are in the middle of New York City, which was just slammed by a hurricane, leaving behind so much trouble, so much difficulty and trauma, which everyone here is still dealing with every day. 

Last night we shot some pre-tape segments in greenwich Village, which was pitch black dark for blocks and blocks, as it has been for a week now. 

Its pretty impossible to describe walking through these city streets in total darkness. It can't even be called a trip through time, because as long as new york has lived, its been lit. By electricity, gas lamps, candlelight, kerosene. But this was pitch black, street after street, corner round corner. And for me, the village being the very place that made me into a comedian and a man, to walk through the heart of it and feel like, in a way, it was dead. I can't tell you how that felt. And you also had a palpable sense that inside each dark window was a family or a student or an artist or an old woman living alone, just being int he dark and waiting for the day to come back. Like we were all having one big sleep over, but not so much fun as that. 

This is how a lot of the city is still. I know people in queens, brooklyn, Staten Island, new jersey, all over, are not normal yet. And not normal is hard. 

And here at 30 rock, these folks are working so hard this week. There are kids in the studio every day, because members of the crew and staff had to bring them to work. Many people are sharing lodging. Everyone is tired. But there's this feeling here that we've got to put on a great show. I'm sure it feels like that here every week. But wow. I feel really lucky to be sharing this time with these particular good folks here at SNL. 

In about 5 hours we'll be going on the air. I'll do a monologue. And we'll show you some sketches that we wrote and try to make you laugh. I'm gonna look really dumb in some of this stuff. But I don't care. Its awfully worth it. And I'm really excited. 

Anyway. I just wanted to let you know. If you watch the show tonight, when Don Pardo says my name and you see me walking out, all the shit in this email is what ill be thinking. I'm a pretty lucky guy. I hope you enjoy the show.

Thanks. 

Louis C.K. 

Live. From new york. Its saturday night.

1370302682.0,30,self.LiveFromNewYork,1fm6lj,"I made a list of all the recurring sketches that can still be done now that Fred, Bill (and maybe Jason) are gone.",34,4,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/LiveFromNewYork/comments/1fm6lj/i_made_a_list_of_all_the_recurring_sketches_that/,"With the recent changes in cast I came to a realization that most (near all) of the current recurring sketches will no longer be doable, so because I was curious (and because I had a really slow work day) I compiled a list of the remaining recurring sketches (sketches performed more than twice) (not including celebrity impression sketches) that do not require the presence of Jason, Fred, or Bill (if Jason stays on another year this list changes quite a bit).  I used this site: http://snl.jt.org/ and Wikipedia as my sources let me know if I missed any.

**Sketches**

* Ex Porn Stars (Vanessa, Cecily, and a male host)

* Kings of catch phrase comedy (Vanessa, Bobby, Kennan, and several cast members who have departed, but this sketch is achievable with any cast members as you only have one on the screen at a time) 

* B108 FM (Bobby, Taran, Vanessa, and host)

* Attention teachers and stuuuudents (Jay, Kenan, Vanessa, and host)

* Girlfriends talk show (Aidy, Cecily, and female host)

* Sheila Sovage (Kate and Kenan) (this is the bar sketch that was done with Louis CK and later Vince Vaughn) 

* Janet Peckingpaugh (Bobby) (unattractive woman who is persistently hit on and eventually picked up by attractive male host) 

* The firing sketch (Bobby, Cecily, and Tim) (In which Cecily and Bobby insult all of their fellow coworkers because they assume they are being fired) 

**Weekend update walk on’s (not including celebrity impressions)**

* Jacob the Bar Mitzvah Boy (Vanessa)

* Anthony Crispino (Second hand news guy) (Bobby)

* Drunk Uncle (Bobby)

* The girl you wish you hadn’t have started a conversation with at a party (Cecily)

* Jean K. Jean (Kenan)

**Sketches that COULD be done with cast changes but are assumed retired (probably due to the writers of each leaving):**

* Mark Payne (Bobby) (Last performed 11/22/2008)

* Bedelia (Nasim) (Last performed 5/7/2011)

* Googie Rene’s (Kenan) (Last performed 5/7/2011)

* Barbara Birmingham (Kenan) (update character) (Last performed 11/3/2007)

* Grady Wilson’s sex moves (Kenan) (Last performed 1/8/2011)

* Eternal spark of love (Kenan) (Last performed 2/22/2010)

* Oscar Rogers (Kenan) (update character) (Last performed 2/14/2009)

* Virginiaca Hastings (Kenan) (Last performed 12/5/2009)

Now while many will be concerned and even alarmed by the fact that only 8 recurring sketches are left with this cast (and five update characters) I could not be more excited, because this means the writers and the cast will have to venture in to new territory and the result could lead to new amazing classics that with any hope at all could fill the void left by the exodus.

I asked if people wanted this, and a few people said yes.

I went to this week's show (Melissa McCarthy w/ Phoenix) and was able to spend time backstage before and after the show. I also got to go to the after party.

I have friends who work on varying parts of the show and have met a few cast members. 

I work at the Upright Citizens Brigade theatre in NYC and am currently at work, so I may be able to ask around for more answers.

I work until 10:30, but sometimes work is too busy at times to really focus on this, but I'll try to answer as much as I can.

You know, the ones with the kids. He also makes up a third of the popular Youtube comedy group Good Neighbor, whose videos have a combined 31 million hits. He and Nick Rutherford have a Youtube show called Theatre of Life, which has around 8 millions hits. In addition to this, he's part of Upright Citizens Brigade, which is heavily associated to  SNL (Amy Poehler, Horatio Sanz, Rob Riggle, Casey Wilson, Nasim Pedrad, Bobby Moynihan, Fred Armisen, Adam McKay, Will Ferrell, Rachel Dratch, Abby Elliot, Tina Fey, Bill Hader, Jenny Slate, Jason Sudeikis, David Koechner). In addition, guess who directs the AT&amp;T spots? Jorma Taccone. Not saying that knowing Jorma gets him in, but you've gotta think his word means something, right? Adam McKay has also praised the Good Neighbor videos. 

Now, to the abject conjecture: with Bill Hader leaving, he would be an awesome choice to host the myriad of game shows that Hader became known for. He's definitely got a little bit of Sudeikis's dry wit, as well. He totes would be a step in the right direction if SNL wants to redefine itself.

1370917918.0,18,self.LiveFromNewYork,1g3bjy,SNL cast predictions week 1: The Groundlings,29,11,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/LiveFromNewYork/comments/1g3bjy/snl_cast_predictions_week_1_the_groundlings/,"Since this sub-reddit doesn't have a lot to talk about for the next 3 months (aside from reminiscing about days of old) I thought it might be fun to have a discussion thread every Monday focusing in on different improv places that Lorne Michaels has a tendency to recruit from and speculate on who among each group may or may not be cast for the upcoming season.  When I first developed this idea I had thought it would be interesting over the next 10 Mondays (or so) to review every one from Second city, Io, Annoyance, UCBNY, UCBLA, The Groundlings, and the SNL writing staff, to see who (if anyone) stood a chance at maybe joining the cast, but upon further inspection this would mean reviewing some 1000 plus people which would be insane so to narrow it down we will just focus on the men, why just the men you ask?  Because over the course of SNL’s history the most women they have ever had at one time on the cast was 6 and that was only for 2 years, otherwise they average 5 or less and we currently have 5 with no reports of any of them leaving this season (not being sexist just going off statistics) however if anyone would like to suggest a woman from whatever category we are discussing that week or start a different thread for it entirely I both recommend and support it.  With that said we narrow the number down to somewhere between 500 and 600 broken into 10 weeks which is slightly more manageable (still pretty insane).  So here is how its works:
 
* Week 1 Groundlings (this week)
* Week 2 UCBNY Part 1
* Week 3 UCBNY Part 2
* Week 4 Second City
* Week 5 Io LA
* Week 6 Io Chicago Part 1
* Week 7 Io Chicago Part 2
* Week 8 Io Chicago Part 3 
* Week 9 Io Chicago Part 4 (we have a lot of Io Chicago to go through)
* Week 10 The SNL writers (where we discuss if anyone from the current writing staff may become a cast member, probably will become a Mulaney circle jerk but I still think its worth a discussion)
 
(I decided to cut Annoyance because only 3 people in the history of SNL have come from there, and I cut UCBLA because to the best of my knowledge no one has been recruited from there yet)

If anyone has any critiques I would like to hear them.

So each week I will post everyone under that category’s name along with their highest viewed video on Youtube (not necessarily their best but their highest viewed) and we will discuss who if any from each category would/should/could get picked (as both a cast member and or a writer).
 
So if you find yourself bored between Game of thrones ending and Breaking bad beginning come join the discussion, or don't, I'm a Reddit post not a cop.

the alternative is to stand in line day of? however i don't live in NY and if i got tickets i would plan a trip there around it, but don't really want to go without tickets and waste time sitting around. so i guess the only feasible option is to win the lottery.

Seth Meyers (12 years)
Fred Armisen (11 years)

Bill Hader (8 Years)
Jason Sudeikis (8 Years)

The new kid’s on the block (of places SNL recruits from) several Cast and Writers alike from the last 13 years have either gotten their start here and even more have come to do guest spots AFTER working on SNL.  Some would argue that based on the overall statistics of SNL’s history that this group does not stand as great of a shot as Second city and the Groundlings, but what we need to keep in mind is that UCB has only been around for a third of SNL’s life span and already they make up a at least a somewhat noticeable percentage of both the writing staff and cast.  Unlike last week Where we had roughly 30 candidates UCBNY has a total of 307 performers, Because of this huge number I have decided to do what I did last week and exclude the women once again (see last weeks post for explanation: http://www.reddit.com/r/LiveFromNewYork/comments/1g3bjy/snl_cast_predictions_week_1_the_groundlings/) this method eliminates 104 of the candidates, this along with 6 men who have already worked or currently work for SNL brings our number down to 197 which we are going to divide into 2 groups (this week and next) of 98 and 99, still a lot but with the summer drought of television its some new content to watch.  So without further delay here is week one of two of UCBNY: http://newyork.ucbtheatre.com/performers
Note: Neil Casey and Chris Kelly are not included in this list because they will be on the list of SNL writers in week 10.

Normally I would list all the potential people of the week and a video for each, but as I neared the bottom of the list the power went out at my place and because I was not saving I lost everything, so this week I will not be posting videos out of frustration (sorry for the inconvience I will recomince next week) here are the past two weeks threads: http://www.reddit.com/r/LiveFromNewYork/comments/1g3bjy/snl_cast_predictions_week_1_the_groundlings/ http://www.reddit.com/r/LiveFromNewYork/comments/1gk73d/snl_cast_predictions_week_2_ucbny_part_1/ 

So without further a due here are the men from UCBNY last names L through Z:

Note: John Mulaney and Joshua Patten are not included in this list because they will be on the list of SNL writers in week 10 in addition Bobby Moynihan and Horatio Sanz are not on this list as they are of course Current and passed cast respectively.

One of the most recent examples of this would be Jason Sudeikis who was a writer for two years and then went on to become a cast member.  So it does happen, the question is does anyone from the current group of writers seem like they would be better utilized as cast.  
Here are the current writers according to Wikipedia:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Saturday_Night_Live_writers#Season_38_.282012-2013.29
Next week I will make a post with all of the users speculations (except for the ones who PMed me and said they want to remain anonymous) to see if anyone is correct in the coming months when they announce who was picked up :).
I have removed Seth Meyers and Lorne Michaels from this list for obvious reasons and added Claire Mulaney (who was just recently added: http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-07-17/entertainment/chi-chicago-claire-mulaney-saturday-night-live_1_bill-hader-improv-team-second-city) feel free to add any guest writers who may not be on this list or give any intel on writers who may be missing or have left since the end of this latest season.

So if you want to discuss this final batch of iO Chicago or post a video or what have you, go right ahead, if you don't and down vote this post, no hard feelings.  Next week we will discuss the writers and then the week following that I am going to post everyone's predictions from the past 10 weeks and we will see if anyone is right in the upcoming month or so.

It was a nice day on Friday so we decided to head up Coney Island and enjoy the day. We rolled back through to see how the line was after dark and it was pretty deep. Couldn't convince anyone to stick it out with me for just a ""chance"". I was pretty tired from walking all day and didn't end up waiting. I won the ticket lottery 2 years ago so I already had the experience. Hope all the poor souls that stuck it out made it in.

We got 3 of his best impersonations (Will Smith, Jay-Z, Kanye West) and his best original character, Principal Frye. It's by far the most we've seen him, especially outside an episode that didn't include a black host.

The Frye appearance was the first time I've found myself crying from laughter at his performance. It was also the best written piece of anything he's ever had, which probably led to the break from character.

The 2nd part of this question would be the upcoming presidential election. Armisen's Obama is good. Pharoah's is off the charts amazing. One would guess Jay playing Obama in the fall would lead to higher ratings from certain demographics, if not all.

We're started at season 15 and we're currently up to 18. The thing that kills me though is how many skits get cut. I can understand the musical performances, but there's so many actual comedy sketches cut out from Netflix. Usually at least 3-4 sketches per episode.

I know there's got to be a source out there with all the complete, uncut episodes because the website ""SNL archives"" which documents every sketch every done in any episode of SNL has screencaps from these cut sketches.

1368739441.0,8,self.LiveFromNewYork,1eh5qm,Lets make some predictions about the next episode,10,2,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/LiveFromNewYork/comments/1eh5qm/lets_make_some_predictions_about_the_next_episode/,"So with all the announcements this last week I can’t help but think this Saturdays show is going to be amazing so I thought it might be fun to predict what recurring sketch’s will be used to highlight Bill, Fred and maybe Jason to send them off right.  Here are my predictions/hopes what are yours?

**Cold Open:** 

* I do not think the cold open will be political this episode (which is a rare and risky prediction I know) my prediction is made more risky by the fact that I do not know what the sketch would be about.  HOWEVER if it is a political sketch I would not be surprised if Fred retook over the role of portraying Obama one last time, maybe even have both Jay and Fred portray Obama in a sketch together.

**Monologue:**

* Due to Justin Timberlake’s induction a few episodes back I think we will not have a 5 timers club sketch following the monologue like we did for Timberlake BUT it will be mentioned in the monologue and have walk ons from either Alec Baldwin, Tom Hanks, Steve Martin, Justin Timberlake, or Kanye (since he is also going to be inducted this episode) or any combination of those people (I don’t see any of the other 5 timers making cameos this episode).

**Weekend update:**

* I’m going to bet that Seth will make some sort of reference/nod/wink during update at some point to the fact that it has now been officially announced that he is moving on to late night next year (despite this not being his last episode).

* A Stefon guest spot (without a shadow of a doubt) despite Ben Afflek being in the first ever appearance with Stefon I don’t think he will appear with Stefon as it will distract (and likely take away) from Bill’s last portrayal of Stefon while a cast member on the show.

* Because this is Fred’s last episode I am going to make a risky prediction and say one of the other two to three guest segments will be Nicholas Fehn (Fred Armisen’s Newspaper rant guy) its probably his most famous solo weekend update guest spot, but we have not seen it used since (I think) last season so who knows.

* If they have a third weekend update guest spot it might be nice to see Jason get it, probably the best of his walk on characters (that doesn’t require another person) is the Devil, they just need a topic to go with the segment.  

**Recurring sketches:**

* Roger Brush was a funny Fred character (that was the producer who sat in for his sick host in a doctor Phil type talk show) but I don’t know why but I don’t feel like we will see this one.

* I think “the scared straight kids” would be an excellent sketch to use since it includes Jason and Bill.  Usually its Kenan, Jason, Bill, Bobby, and Andy but they could sub out Andy’s spot with Taran.

* As for a recurring sketch where Jason shines I actually think that Maine Justice would be a excellent pick, its only been done twice but it’s a great example of what Jason can do and is very very funny.  

* If it is announced in the next 24 hours that Kenan is leaving as well I think a “whats up with that” (although I am sure we can agree it is over played) would be an appropriate salute and send off to his many years on the show (they may still do this anyways due to the inability to continue the sketch without Bill, Fred and if he leaves Jason).  This sketch also allows for 2-3 celebrity cameos, I think the probability of seeing either: Steve Carell, Rainn Wilson, John Krasinski, Jenna Fischer, or Ricky Gervais in this sketch is elevated due to the office’s series finale airing tonight maybe even two of them, Depending on who they pick I bet that will be the person who keeps getting cut off by Kenan who is interviewing them regarding the office.

* I would like to see the “Song memories” sketch with Bill, Jason, and in replacement of Andy (who replaced Will Forte when he left) Fred, along with Ben Affleck.  It’s always a great sketch and would be yet another appropriate send off to those cast members.  Hell they might even be able to work it so this is the final sketch of the season (if they can’t think of another send off sketch).

**Sketches I don’t think we will see but I would like to see involving Jason, Fred, or Bill:**

* Vinny Vedecci talk show would be a great sketch to do (includes Fred and Bill) another of Bill’s great characters, (but the last one was 2010 so we won’t see it).

* Vince Price would be amazing (but again 2010 was the last one so we won’t see it)

* The Prince show was easily my favorite Fred Armisen sketch BUT Maya is very very pregnant and the sketch hasn’t been done in over 6 years.

* Something involving the two A-holes, (not only have they not done this in a long time it would require Kirsten to make another cameo)

Now seeing as how Saturday night live is a pretty iconic show where crazy things happen, I would not put it entirely out of the realm of possibilities that Daft Punk does a song with Kanye, they have been promoting their new album exclusively during SNL and this is the season finale we are talking about.

Part of what draws me to SNL is that it is live TV.  If there are mistakes, we get to see those.  The grittiness of the performance is part of the experience.  So when the sketches are altered when uploaded to the web, I feel a bit cheated.  

This last episode I recall that Aidy Bryant was late entering during the [Roundball Rock](http://www.hulu.com/watch/478693#i1,p8,d1) sketch.  However, in the HULU version, the scene has been nicely edited to fix this error.  

Back in January, I recall that during the [More Hobbit](http://www.hulu.com/watch/447654) prerecorded bit, there was an error with ""Hobbit 11"" where the screen actually said ""Hobbit 10"" or something.  Also there was that weird buffering error where the video didn't play correctly.  Watch it on HULU and it looks like there were no problems.  

For the Vince Vaughn episode I'm not as perturbed that the music was changed during [Last Call](http://www.hulu.com/watch/478690#i1,p4,d1).  I can understand that the original jukebox selection ""Hit the Road Jack"" would be to expensive to get the online rights too.  I would rather have the sketch altered than not be available online, but in this form it is missing one of its good jokes.  

Am I alone in my desire for the raw material to be put online?  Do other people even notice a difference?",,False,self,t5_2s7yh,False,,,True,t3_1cd5fh,http://www.reddit.com/r/LiveFromNewYork/comments/1cd5fh/online_sketches_vary_from_live_versions/,

Second City and Io together have brought SNL more cast members over the years than most other sources (Dan Aykroyd, John Belushi, Gilda Radner, Bill Murray, Robin Duke, Tim Kazurinsky, Tony Rosato, Mary Gross, Jim Belushi, Brian Doyle-Murray, Martin Short, Nora Dunn, Mike Myers, Chris Farley, Tim Meadows, David Koechner, Nancy Walls, Horatio Sanz, Rachel Dratch, Horatio Sanz, Rachel Dratch, Tina Fey, Seth Meyers, Vanessa Bayer, Paul Brittain, Aidy Bryant, Tim Robinson, Cecily Strong).  So an argument can be made that the new cast members may very well come from this particular list (or any of the lists from this week thru week 9). 
As with the prior three weeks we will just be focusing in on the men (in this weeks case only the men who have the title of “ensemble” by their name) and only the men with a picture but if anyone thinks a particular lady is worth noting please bring them up (ideally with a video of some of their work).
