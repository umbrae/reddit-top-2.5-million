I am going to donate Monday of next week and encourage you all to make a contribution, and be outspoken about your views with people you know, and more importantly those that you do not. Do your best not to be confrontational or stray from the facts.

It is hard in an environment where the right wing has gone so far into crazy town. Rejection of basic science, [harassing a man with Parkinson's because of his views about health care](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_PX5L_v_7I), cheering at a Republican debate when the idea is floated to let those with Cancer and no health insurance to die, and now even lower lows, trying to say that women that get pregnant from a rape must have really wanted it. This is how bad things have gotten, a far cry from the Republican party that I remember.

I digress, thanks for all of your support in this. I am sure that any money that is raised will be put to good use.

**We have to stop these fools**

The fate of the entire planet may be at stake. And although this statement may prove to be reactionary, or too extreme, Greenland melted this year, the hottest year on record. And we missed the opportunity to have a president whose main agenda was stopping Climate Change, by only a few votes.

I will PM everyone who commented here to thank them and see if they, or people in their circles can afford to donate on Monday.

Edit: Well, I received a message that the r/politics thread was removed? Although it appears to still be there. Not sure why or what is up there.

Edit: As per the suggestion by pelicansurf123, I started a thread in r/politics, perhaps head over there and upvote and see if we can get traction [there](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/yn1av/robama_is_trying_to_get_traction_for_a_donate_to/).

Edit: Looks like there is some interest here. I will let this go for a couple of days and see if it gains more traction. 

If someone has experience coordinating things of this nature on Reddit and has any advice, I welcome any thoughts on how to best proceed. My plan now is to set a date next week and plan to donate then.

**Also please see the comment below by 99Kelly on other ways to contribute that do not cost money.**

Do so little for their states that by the time re-election comes their states will want nothing to do with them. 

Primary them.  Run better candidates in their states when they run independently. Deprive them of a shred of fundraising power from the party machine. Pass laws specifically targeting how they make money. Blackball them as lobbyists before they even get the jobs. 

Bipartisan? No. Like Bush? Yes. But you know what? Fuck compromise. On anything else, yes. But not on this.

First I want to focus on some myths: 

**""Obama is just following Bush's timeline to end the Iraq war""** 

Actually the truth is, Obama put together the timeline for withdrawal working in conjunction with the Iraqi president Malki. Bush nor McCain had any intentions of signing the ""overly aggressive timeline"" Barack Obama had put forth. However, by the time it came to sign, Barack was president elect and Bush had completely caved. Signing Obama's timeline into law with SOFA: [1](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/chris-weigant/obamas-iraq-withdrawal-ti_b_668173.html) [2](http://www.chrisweigant.com/2008/12/08/a-close-look-at-the-iraq-status-of-forces-agreement-part-1/) [3](http://www.chrisweigant.com/2008/12/09/a-close-look-at-the-iraq-status-of-forces-agreement-part-2/) 

**""Obama just replaced our combat troops with private contractors, spending levels are the same""**  

No, there are contractors in Iraq but nothing like the extremist Libertarians try to paint it out to be, and those are being reduced also [1](http://www.watertowndailytimes.com/article/20120308/NEWS03/703089841/-1/NEWS03) [2](http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/why-the-us-should-reverse-course-on-iraq/2012/02/22/gIQAfrDgYR_story.html) [3](http://www.heritage.org/research/testimony/2012/03/defense-budget-when-national-security-becomes-last-priority)

**Obama is just continuing the war in Afghanistan** 

Again, not true. An aggressive withdrawal has been announced there as well (too aggressive for many Republicans): [1](http://www.nationaljournal.com/nationalsecurity/the-coming-upheaval-in-u-s-afghanistan-strategy-20120311) [2](http://www.timesunion.com/news/article/Obama-Time-has-come-to-wind-down-Afghan-war-3384297.php) [3](http://thehill.com/blogs/defcon-hill/policy-and-strategy/212603-gop-hits-obama-for-afghan-apology-warns-against-rapid-withdrawal)

**Obama started a third war** 

Libya is not a war. It's a UN intervention and there is a big difference [1](http://articles.cnn.com/2011-03-20/opinion/bergen.libya.us_1_arab-league-obama-administration-libyan-intervention?_s=PM:OPINION) [2](http://www.juancole.com/2011/08/top-ten-myths-about-the-libya-war.html) 

**Obama signed the NDAA** 

It passed with a VETO proof majority. Passing a ""symbolic veto"" would have played right into the politics the Repbulican party wanted. [1](http://crooksandliars.com/karoli/confused-about-ndaa-and-detention-provision) [2](http://pleasecutthecrap.typepad.com/main/2012/01/last-word-on-ndaa-if-you-dont-like-it-stop-helping-right-wingers-win.html) [3](http://azvern.posterous.com/for-the-idiots-who-call-obama-a-traitor-for-s)

**Obama is a ""corporate whore for Wall Street**

Everyone should be aware by now of how crucial having a cooperative Congress is to getting positive policy outcomes. Unfortunately, there are at least two factors working against Democrats this election:

1. There are way more safe Republican seats than safe Democratic seats.

2. Only about 20% of House races are considered in-play, which is great if you're a PAC looking to funnel advertising dollars into competitive districts but not so good if you're a grassroots supporter living in one of the other 80% of districts.

Having said that, it's not hopeless. It's possible for Democrats to retake the House. But it's going to take some heavy lifting. Democrats need to win all of the safe D, lean D, and tossup seats *and* 12 of the 33 lean R seats.

So my message is this: [Find an in-play (i.e. tossup or leaning) House district near you](http://elections.nytimes.com/2012/ratings/house) (preferably your own, but only about 20% of us will be so lucky) and get involved. If there aren't any in-play districts near you, consider donating to a candidate in one elsewhere. You can also donate to [the DCCC](http://dccc.org/) or [the House Majority PAC](http://www.thehousemajoritypac.com/), both of which run ads for Democrats in competitive House races.

(A note for any Republican/independent Obama supporters: If you know of a Republican or independent congressional candidate you think would work productively with Obama to get things done, by all means, vote for them. Just be sure to take a good look at their track record and campaign statements to see whether they're really willing to do so. As a liberal I think a Democratic Congress would be the best outcome, but any Congress where there are enough moderates to reach reasonable compromises on important issues is an improvement over what we have now.)",,False,,t5_1a8ah,False,,,True,t3_xun3w,http://www.reddit.com/r/obama/comments/xun3w/reelecting_obama_is_great_n_all_but_lets_not/,

Recently, I broke my shoulder while skiing. I have skied for years, and I rarely fall, except of course that day. After a trip to the ER, I have seen multiple doctors and received multiple x-rays. I have no idea how much I would be in debt if it weren't for Obama. Because of health care reform, my shoulder is healing nicely. I am able to go to physical therapy. I'm not back to full strength but I will be. I won't have a lasting deformity.

I have a friend who had almost the exact same injury three years ago.  He did not have insurance so he did not see a doctor for it. He still can't raise his arm all the way up, and there is something visibly wrong with his shoulder when he doesn't have a shirt on. He was in pain for months because of his shoulder.

1247628484.0,120,self.obama,91a2u,Finally: Obama to scrap Homeland security's color-coded terrorism advisories,175,55,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/obama/comments/91a2u/finally_obama_to_scrap_homeland_securitys/,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Obama administration has begun a review that could spell the end of the color-coded terrorism advisories, long derided by late night TV comics and portrayed by some Democrats as a tool for Bush administration political manipulation.

It's not likely the review will plunge an alert system into the dark all together, but short of that, everything is on the table for consideration, according to one administration official familiar with the plans. The official was not authorized to speak publicly about potential outcomes.

The alert system assigns five different colors to terror risk levels. Green at the bottom signals a low danger of attack and red at the top warns of a severe threat. It was put in place after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and was designed to help emergency responders get prepared.

But it's been the butt of late-night television comics' jokes and criticized by Republicans and Democrats alike for being too vague to deliver enough useful information.

""Like yesterday, apparently, went from blue to pink and now half the country thinks we're pregnant,"" ""Tonight Show"" host Jay Leno said on March 14, 2002. ""To give you an idea how sophisticated this system is, today they added a plaid in case we were ever attacked by Scotland.""

And Democrats have said the Bush administration used the system for political manipulation to trumpet the administration's anti-terrorist credentials.

""They raised and lowered it several times in fairly rapid succession,"" former national Democratic Party chairman Howard Dean said. ""It had something to do with politics.""

For example, in August 2004, then-Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge raised the alert level to orange, the second-highest level signifying a high risk of attack, in Washington, New York City and Newark, N.J., because of potential threats to financial buildings there. But Democrats questioned the Bush administration's motives, because the change came as they concluded their presidential convention and swung attention to national security, the signature issue of President George W. Bush's re-election campaign.

Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano announced the review Tuesday by a panel of 17 people that include Democrats and Republicans, mayors, governors, police executives, and public and private security experts. It is a balanced group clearly designed to not only evaluate the alert system but also to provide political cover from critics for any changes to the color-coded system.

""My goal is simple: To have the most effective system in place to inform the American people about threats to our country,"" Napolitano said in a statement.

Scrapping the color system could prove complicated because many local governments have policies triggered when the federal government changes the alert level, in some cases, qualifying for federal aid for police overtime, said the official who spoke on condition of anonymity.

After the 60-day review, Napolitano will confer with other cabinet members before making a recommendation to the White House, the official said. Even if the panel says the color-coded system is the best option, Napolitano will be open to that.

Reaching across the political spectrum is a smart move, said James Carafano, a review panel member and fellow at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank.

Scrapping the colors needs to be done in a way that doesn't leave the administration vulnerable to ridicule or criticism that it's being soft on terrorism, Carafano said.

Fran Townsend, a former White House homeland security adviser for George W. Bush and once a key intelligence aide to Democratic Attorney General Janet Reno, is co-chairing the review panel with William H. Webster. Webster is the only man ever to head both the FBI and the CIA, the first in a Democratic administration and the second in a Republican one.

Townsend called it a no-win assignment, but an important one.

""This is a system that was devised in the immediate aftermath of the most horrific attack on American soil that we've ever suffered,"" she said. Reviewing the system nearly eight years later is an opportunity. ""You need a warning system,"" but there might be a more effective way to communicate with the public, Townsend said.

No system will give everyone all the details about threat information that they might want, she said. But as a mother, she sees a need to have enough detail to make an informed decision about protecting her family.

""Maybe there is no better way,"" she said. But Napolitano ""is right to ask the question and have us take a look at it.""

Former Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge also thinks now is a good time for review. Ridge was traveling and could not be reached Tuesday, but an aide said Napolitano told him about the review before she announced it.

The alert level has not been changed since 2006 when it was raised from yellow - an elevated or significant risk of terrorist attack - to red then lowered to orange in the aviation sector after terrorist plans to blow up jetliners en route to the U.S. from Britain were discovered.

The nation has never been below yellow since 2001, but the warnings have been revised so that they can address a specific region or sector, as opposed to the entire country. The United States hasn't been attacked since 2001, though plots have been disrupted.

The Homeland Security Department will accept public comment on the system by e-mail to hsasreview(at)dhs.gov.
