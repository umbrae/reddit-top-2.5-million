1371605131.0,733,self.education,1gmj6z,"I teach Grade 8, and I am gay, and today one of the “cool guys” made me cry tears of pride. (x-post from /r/lgbt)",867,134,88,http://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/1gmj6z/i_teach_grade_8_and_i_am_gay_and_today_one_of_the/,"Context: I teach Grade 8 (13-14 years old) in Ontario, Canada. I am gay, and my students have known this for about a month or so. I am in my first year of teaching, and I teach something of a ""tough"" class. 

In particular, I have one group of boys that can be a bit of a pain in the neck. Never keep their hands to themselves, always talk out of turn, have gotten in fights, etc. There is one boy in this group (he will be known here as Harry) who is a little quieter than the others, but very popular. He’s a bit tough to get close to, and seems like the type to be resistant to new ideas and different people. He hangs out with another tough kid (let’s call him Mark), who is loud and boisterous and often rude.

Now that it’s so close to the end of the year, I do a “YouTube of the Day” with them every morning. Kids can send in a short YouTube video for me to show to the class, I preview it, and if it’s appropriate, I play it. So this morning, Harry comes up to me and says, “I have a video I want to play.”

Now, I preview things for a reason. There are enough horror stories out there of teachers accidentally showing their kids porn for me to be very careful what I show my class. So I tell him to send it to me because, y’know, them’s the rules. 

“I really want to show it,” he says back. “You’ll like it, I promise. It’s a music video.”

Given what Harry listens to, I’m wary. He listens to a lot of rap and hip-hop, and that’s fine, but I’ve heard some non-school-appropriate language come out of the music he listens to. So I ask him if it’s appropriate for school; he tells me yes. 

This kid is many things, but he has never lied to me, that I'm aware of. Not once. So… I take a deep breath and tell him okay. What the heck. 

(Note: I did read the lyrics, and they were beautiful, but what came next was unexpectedly awesome.)

So he goes on over and pulls it on up, and on comes a song I have never heard before. The artist is rapping about growing up gay, about the struggles of being gay, and about standing up in the face of hatred and homophobia. “Same Love,” by Macklemore and Ryan Lewis. The video (linked) was beautiful. 

And there’s Harry, proudly watching along with the rest of the class as the artist stands up for those gay kids who struggle, and the video shows a difficult, lonely life culminating in a fabulous wedding. Harry. My “tough kid.”

The video finishes, the kids applaud, and I thank him, and he says to me, “I told you you’d like it.”

And then his loud, rude friend Mark says: “That was for you, Mr. K.”

The whole class applauded again – for me this time – and then I cried. I cried the proudest tears I have ever shed. 

Harry and Mark… they might tick off every teacher they ever have, but today they gave this teacher a moment he’ll never forget.  

tl;dr: Tough kid in my class showed a music video whose message is to stand up against homophobia, and the class cheered.

Today one of the punks in my class comes up to me and says ""Ms. XYZ, I'm sorry I haven't been doing my homework, I really cant fail your class.. can I come after school and do my homework in your classroom?""

So I say ""sure, but why cant you do it at home?""

Now she gets mad and shuts down and says ""Forget it"" and try's to walk away.

I stop her, I say ""you can tell me whats going on, you wont be in trouble""

At this point she breaks down and cries, I was holding her arm so she wouldn't run, and she just collapses into my arms.

After a bit of sobbing she tells me, he mom bailed on her two months ago, she was locked out of the shitty efficiency they where living in, and she has been living in a sketchy homeless shelter for the last month. She doesn't have a flat spot (like a desk, or bed) to do her homework, and if she fails my class the school will kick her out and she wont be able to eat lunches.

WTF world.

Edit: I call her a punk because she dresses like a punk kid from the 90`s.. it was more affection than anything, I was a punk/bad kid and also a high school drop out, 
I'm not putting her down.. promise.. I am seriously thinking about bringing her home tomorrow after school with me.

Update: I wasapproved by dhhs to take her in. I have a day to get my apartment kid ready... aka I need a new bed and I'm going to lock up my liquor :-) . I went to the shelter just now to check out her stuff. She has a garbage bag full of clothes and stuff.. I will get her some things to fill in the gaps. I haven't told her yet. I'm taking her out to dinner tonight and breaking the news then. The great thing about my place is I have a huge finished addict, I'm going to convert it to a bedroom for her, so she will have her own bathroom and closet, but she still has to walk right by my room to get out. ...... any advice?


Also, I am female and 25. A few people wondered.

tl.dr. Bad student in my class confesses to being homeless. she is 13.

I know you will likely never read this, however, maybe you will, and maybe others like you will.  Hopefully it will do something.

We live in a time when it is fashionable for many on both sides of the political spectrum to attack educators.  Lately, it seems that almost daily there is another attack on a teacher, teachers, teachers unions, or teachers' rights in the news.  Do not believe it.  Most of us are in this profession because we care about the future of this country and your mind.  

I'm sorry we are so hamstrung by state indicators and standardized tests.  I know that they make class boring, idiotic, and at times unbearable.  If you feel this way, can you imagine how I feel?  Can you imagine the tedium of having to bury my dreams, ideas, and worst of all, hopes for your mind, in place of ""student can demonstrate knowledge of author's style, tone, and genre.""  Fuck that.  I hate it.  I want to let you explore literature and writing.  I want you to know no boundaries, but to give you some steps up the ladder when you need it, but I can't, because I'll lose my job, and I have a family, a pet, a house, and massive amounts of student loan debt to get the degrees the state said I needed to become the ""highly qualified teacher"" that we need, yet does not pay me enough to pay off these loans.

I am sorry.

I want to also take this chance to ask you to educate yourself outside the classroom.  As I've stated above, sometimes there are reasons beyond your teacher that make class boring.  Good teachers try to use these state requirements and still be good teachers, and I try, oh how I fucking try, staying up until 2 in the morning multiple nights a week to come up with the perfect game to learn the life and times of Shakespeare, or how to teach you how to use subordinating conjunctions in a way that is not mind-numbing.  I try so hard, and I'm sorry I fail so often, but I try.  I'm even more sorry, however, that I have to teach you some useless shit that you need to regurgitate on a useless test.

Please, be knowledgeable of this.  Please know the situation we are on.  Please stop bitching and gossipping and fucking do something about it once you hit that magical age of 18.  Please.  For my kids.

Study English pronunciation.

I will teach you in my verse

Sounds like corpse, corps, horse, and worse.

I will keep you, Suzy, busy,

Make your head with heat grow dizzy.

Tear in eye, your dress will tear.

So shall I! Oh hear my prayer.

Just compare heart, beard, and heard,

Dies and diet, lord and word,

Sword and sward, retain and Britain.

(Mind the latter, how it’s written.)

Now I surely will not plague you

With such words as plaque and ague.

But be careful how you speak:

Say break and steak, but bleak and streak;

Cloven, oven, how and low,

Script, receipt, show, poem, and toe.

Hear me say, devoid of trickery,

Daughter, laughter, and Terpsichore,

Typhoid, measles, topsails, aisles,

Exiles, similes, and reviles;

Scholar, vicar, and cigar,

Solar, mica, war and far;

One, anemone, Balmoral,

Kitchen, lichen, laundry, laurel;

Gertrude, German, wind and mind,

Scene, Melpomene, mankind.

Billet does not rhyme with ballet,

Bouquet, wallet, mallet, chalet.

Blood and flood are not like food,

Nor is mould like should and would.

Viscous, viscount, load and broad,

Toward, to forward, to reward.

And your pronunciation’s OK

When you correctly say croquet,

Rounded, wounded, grieve and sieve,

Friend and fiend, alive and live.

Ivy, privy, famous; clamour

And enamour rhyme with hammer.

River, rival, tomb, bomb, comb,

Doll and roll and some and home.

Stranger does not rhyme with anger,

Neither does devour with clangour.

Souls but foul, haunt but aunt,

Font, front, wont, want, grand, and grant,

Shoes, goes, does. Now first say finger,

And then singer, ginger, linger,

Real, zeal, mauve, gauze, gouge and gauge,

Marriage, foliage, mirage, and age.

Query does not rhyme with very,

Nor does fury sound like bury.

Dost, lost, post and doth, cloth, loth.

Job, nob, bosom, transom, oath.

Though the differences seem little,

We say actual but victual.

Refer does not rhyme with deafer.

Foeffer does, and zephyr, heifer.

Mint, pint, senate and sedate;

Dull, bull, and George ate late.

Scenic, Arabic, Pacific,

Science, conscience, scientific.

Liberty, library, heave and heaven,

Rachel, ache, moustache, eleven.

We say hallowed, but allowed,

People, leopard, towed, but vowed.

Mark the differences, moreover,

Between mover, cover, clover;

Leeches, breeches, wise, precise,

Chalice, but police and lice;

Camel, constable, unstable,

Principle, disciple, label.

Petal, panel, and canal,

Wait, surprise, plait, promise, pal.

Worm and storm, chaise, chaos, chair,

Senator, spectator, mayor.

Tour, but our and succour, four.

Gas, alas, and Arkansas.

Sea, idea, Korea, area,

Psalm, Maria, but malaria.

Youth, south, southern, cleanse and clean.

Doctrine, turpentine, marine.

Compare alien with Italian,

Dandelion and battalion.

Sally with ally, yea, ye,

Eye, I, ay, aye, whey, and key.

Say aver, but ever, fever,

Neither, leisure, skein, deceiver.

Heron, granary, canary.

Crevice and device and aerie.

Face, but preface, not efface.

Phlegm, phlegmatic, ass, glass, bass.

Large, but target, gin, give, verging,

Ought, out, joust and scour, scourging.

Ear, but earn and wear and tear

Do not rhyme with here but ere.

Seven is right, but so is even,

Hyphen, roughen, nephew Stephen,

Monkey, donkey, Turk and jerk,

Ask, grasp, wasp, and cork and work.

Pronunciation (think of Psyche!)

Is a paling stout and spikey?

Won’t it make you lose your wits,

Writing groats and saying grits?

It’s a dark abyss or tunnel:

Strewn with stones, stowed, solace, gunwale,

Islington and Isle of Wight,

Housewife, verdict and indict.

Finally, which rhymes with enough,

Though, through, plough, or dough, or cough?

Hiccough has the sound of cup.

My advice is to give up!!!

My 7th graders don't terrorize me as 7th graders, but as stunted elementary students who were spoiled by twelve years of day care.  But, it's been getting better, slowly.

Not today though.  Today, I took up essays from my 9th graders.  We've been working on proper essay format and such for a while now, but I still didn't expect miracles though I was optimistic.  I was excited to find out how they were responding to the topics.  The first three I graded were all blatant plagiarism.  The fourth was a noble effort, I suppose, but ultimately was a summary of part of the book and no where near the topic.  If that wasn't enough, the headmaster pulled me aside mid-morning to discuss a parent's complaint that I was ""expecting too much.""  

People wonder where new teacher burnout comes from.  Today I was paid less than any other young professional I know to be told to expect less of children.

1364952464.0,124,self.education,1bk305,"A retirement letter, from the best educator that I ever had...that might hit home for many",145,21,40,http://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/1bk305/a_retirement_letter_from_the_best_educator_that_i/,"Dear Mr. [retracted] and Board of Education Members:

It is with the deepest regret that I must retire at the close of this school year, ending my more than twenty-seven years of service at [High School] on June 30, under the provisions of the 2012-15 contract. I assume that I will be eligible for any local or state incentives that may be offered prior to my date of actual retirement and I trust that I may return to the high school at some point as a substitute teacher.

As with Lincoln and Springfield, I have grown from a young to an old man here; my brother died while we were both employed here; my daughter was educated here, and I have been touched by and hope that I have touched hundreds of lives in my time here. I know that I have been fortunate to work with a small core of some of the finest students and educators on the planet.

I came to teaching forty years ago this month and have been lucky enough to work at a small liberal arts college, a major university and this superior secondary school. To me, history has been so very much more than a mere job, it has truly been my life, always driving my travel, guiding all of my reading and even dictating my television and movie viewing. Rarely have I engaged in any of these activities without an eye to my classroom and what I might employ in a lesson, a lecture or a presentation. With regard to my profession, I have truly attempted to live John Dewey’s famous quotation (now likely cliché with me, I’ve used it so very often) that “Education is not preparation for life, education is life itself.” This type of total immersion is what I have always referred to as teaching “heavy,” working hard, spending time, researching, attending to details and never feeling satisfied that I knew enough on any topic. I now find that this approach to my profession is not only devalued, but denigrated and perhaps, in some quarters despised. STEM rules the day and “data driven” education seeks only conformity, standardization, testing and a zombie-like adherence to the shallow and generic Common Core, along with a lockstep of oversimplified so-called Essential Learnings. Creativity, academic freedom, teacher autonomy, experimentation and innovation are being stifled in a misguided effort to fix what is not broken in our system of public education and particularly not at [High School].

A long train of failures has brought us to this unfortunate pass. In their pursuit of Federal tax dollars, our legislators have failed us by selling children out to private industries such as Pearson Education. The New York State United Teachers union has let down its membership by failing to mount a much more effective and vigorous campaign against this same costly and dangerous debacle. Finally, it is with sad reluctance that I say our 
own administration has been both uncommunicative and unresponsive to the concerns and needs of our staff and students by establishing testing and evaluation systems that are Byzantine at best and at worst, draconian. This situation has been exacerbated by other actions of the administration, in either refusing to call open forum meetings to discuss these pressing issues, or by so constraining the time limits of such meetings that little more than a conveying of information could take place. This lack of leadership at every level has only served to produce confusion, a loss of confidence and a dramatic and rapid decaying of morale. The repercussions of these ill-conceived policies will be telling and shall resound to the detriment of education for years to come. The analogy that this process is like building the airplane while we are flying would strike terror in the heart of anyone should it be applied to an actual airplane flight, a medical procedure, or even a home repair. Why should it be acceptable in our careers and in the education of our children?


My profession is being demeaned by a pervasive atmosphere of distrust, dictating that teachers cannot be permitted to develop and administer their own quizzes and tests (now titled as generic “assessments”) or grade their own students’ examinations. The development of plans, choice of lessons and the materials to be employed are increasingly expected to be common to all teachers in a given subject. This approach not only strangles creativity, it smothers the development of critical thinking in our students and assumes a one-size-fits-all mentality more appropriate to the assembly line than to the classroom. Teacher planning time has also now been so greatly eroded by a constant need to “prove up” our worth to the tyranny of APPR (through the submission of plans, materials and “artifacts” from our teaching) that there is little time for us to carefully critique student work, engage in informal intellectual discussions with our students and colleagues, or conduct research and seek personal improvement through independent study. We have become increasingly evaluation and not knowledge driven. Process has become our most important product, to twist a phrase from corporate America, which seems doubly appropriate to this case.

After writing all of this I realize that I am not leaving my profession, in truth, it has left me. It no longer exists. I feel as though I have played some game halfway through its fourth quarter, a timeout has been called, my teammates’ hands have all been tied, the goal posts moved, all previously scored points and honors expunged and all of the rules altered.

For the last decade or so, I have had two signs hanging above the blackboard at the front of my classroom, they read, “Words Matter” and “Ideas Matter”. While I still believe these simple statements to be true, I don’t feel that those currently driving public education have any inkling of what they mean.

Sincerely and with regret,

BB:  ""That doesn't matter - you have to get them up to the standards set by the customer.  So you are going to continue test your employees for 7 hours over the course of two weeks 2 months before the season ends.  If they perform poorly, it's your ass.""

MM: ""Sir, this takes an inordinate amount of time away from them actually gaining experience and training regarding how they will actually work with the customer.  In our full 9 month season, I spend roughly 2 1/2 months preparing them just for the test and taking the test.  We then have a month and a half after the test is over, so since it is the end of the season they see no reason to continue improving their skill-set.  This translates into 5 months of actual work and progress developing their customer service skills.  Added to the fact that their test score does not act as an incentive for them to perform better.""

BB: ""That's your problem.  You must invent rewards and punishments as an incentive for them to do well on a test. Give them chocolate bars if they perform well.""

BB: ""This is not a factor I will pay attention to.  Bottom-line:  You will test them, their performance will determine your worth as a manager.  If one of them can't read, you will need to take your time to bring a 3rd grade reader up to at least an 8th grade level.  I don't care if you only have 150 hours and have to divide your attention among 150 students.  If they perform poorly, you are a bad manager and will be fired.""

MM: ""There are a tremendous amount of variables that cannot be controlled for.  I have one employee who just lost his house and is living out of his car.  Other employees actually have to give him food at breaks and lunch.  How is he expected to take this test and perform well if his basic needs aren't being met?""

BB: ""You misunderstand your reality and it sounds like you can't do this job - you're sounding like you are one of these bad teachers.  If you don't like it quit.  We'll find someone else who can do it or well fire them.  You're a teacher.  You got into this job with low pay, benefits, criticism for being lazy because the job is seasonal.  As a teacher you are a self-less individual, so act like it.  Acting like it means you do what I say without complaint about the difficulty of this job - I interpret your objections as a sign you are looking out for yourself and therefore are a bad manager -  you are a professional and professionals aren't judged by their time, they're judged by their ability.  You guys use these ineffective union protections; and are usually driven out in 5 years regardless of the protections put in place - another sign of your overall weakness.  We will only judge your ability by the ability of others that you train.  Full stop.  You are a bad manager if they do not perform well - homeless, traumatic brain injury, abuse - I don't care...like a size 8 shoe, their feet must all fit and it's your fault if they don't.""

If there is anything that can help my grade be atleast a D please let me know and I will be extremely thankful. Thank you for taking the time for reading this messege and I will be expecting your reply.


(student),

You have been absent from my class for the equivalent of 2 months time and have been tardy 13 times.  Added to the fact that you leave 15 minutes early from my class.  Again let's add to the seeming disinterest in my class - you claim that "" I have tried my hardest I realy have I know that History is not my strongest subject"", but from what I have seen is that you have squandered every opportunity to be successful.  This is evident by your attendance, assignment completion, and the fact that I have gone through great lengths to police your behavior (telling you to stop talking, moving your seat multiple times).

I do not know what we can do two weeks before your final grade is due.  You have many outstanding assignments that have been hanging out for over two months (or more).  This should have been a conversation at the quarter - at the latest.  Truth is, I have done all I can.  The rest is up to you.

&gt;I'm a teacher and I'd like to tell you about an experience I had many years back. I had this 4th grade class that I was supposed to teach three hours a week and I HATED them. I thought the kids in the class behaved terribly. I felt frustrated and annoyed and my lessons with them were horrible.

&gt;So, I talked with my principal about it, about how badly the kids behaved and how no one was learning anything in those lessons. She suggested that I adopt a point system. This is a teachers' trick, a widely used behaviour modification method where you define to the class what ""good behaviour"" is and every time a kid does one of those behaviours, they get a point. The points add up and eventually they get some kind of reward. In this case, it was a letter written by me saying how diligent the kid had been.

&gt;We decided that there would be three possible points per lesson and I would be writing the name and points on the board for all of the class to see.

&gt;I don't know how much this system modified the kids behaviour. It probably did to some extent. However, it completely changed me, my behaviour and my entire outlook.

&gt;The system required me to pay attention to all of the good behaviour going on, to see the kids coming in from the break, taking out their books and quietly waiting for the lesson to start. I suddenly noticed how well so many kids were working, how cooperative they were, how eagar they were to learn. Before I had been so distracted by the disruptive students and trying to control them that I had never seen anything else. Now I was so busy trying to write down and give points that I didn't have time to even react to the ones misbehaving.
And, the real lesson was in perspective. Because with this system I saw that the noise of the disruption had made me blind. I was writing down 28 or 29 names with points and only 4 or 5 were really making trouble. Their importance suddenly became in proportion to the problem.

&gt;...

&gt;tl;dr - you find what you look for

I noticed it at the community college, but it has become far more apparent at the university: most students are irresponsible, obnoxious, rude, and overarchingly, not very bright.  I came here for an education, thinking I would be surrounded by people of equal intellect interested in higher learning - instead all I get is a bunch of fucking 19 year olds whose main reason for being here is to drink, smoke, and fuck every night while making as much noise and doing as much damage to the local community as possible...all on mommy and daddy's dime.  These asshats are the reason my tuition is sky high.  Because they want to come party for 4 years and get a meaningless degree.  I feel like college has become a worthless endeavor, that it no longer holds any real meaning or value because it has been reduced to a joke in order to spit out kids with shiny diplomas for mom and dad to be proud of, without actually teaching them anything of import.  My community college offered more real challenges to critical thinking, along with a more responsible, mature, and intellectual group of students than my 4-year is looking like it's going to, and I guess the point behind all of this is that I'm disappointed with the state of higher education.  Deeply, frustratingly disappointed.


**Edity editing** - Well that blew up out of nowhere.  Couple things:  I understand that college isn't going to be a bunch of academic, intellectual nerdy-types, sitting around and discussing the universe and the meaning of life.  I never expected that - in fact, that might get really boring after a few days.  What I was expecting was a level of maturity that I haven't really found.  Second, I hope it's not my school...you can't get much smaller than this around here without shelling out an exorbitant amount of money.

I think the biggest part of education is teaching people how to think, so why isn't it done explicitly?

Imagine a society where the general public could call out a politician on a strawman argument or ad hominem and all that. An understanding of what arguments actually imply what conclusions seems to be sorely lacking and it would be such an easy fix. I just don't understand why we don't do it.

(*edit: thanks for all the responses. I'm glad to see others care about this like I do. A lot of you seem to be focusing on how these are taught in other subjects, but I'm more curious about the idea of teaching them (esp. rhetoric and formal logic) independently of other subjects*)

(edit edit: I think I phrased what I'm trying to talk about better in one of the comments below:

&gt;My line of thinking is this:

&gt;If X is important in everything you do, X is a great candidate to be taught to everyone. I thought of a better analogy than last night, and that's basic arithmetic. Anyone can figure out basic counting on their own. Once they figure that out, almost anyone will figure out addition. Then lots of people will figure out subtraction and multiplication and a decent amount would naturally figure out division, and that's all purely from repeated exposure to things requiring it.

&gt;Unfortunately, I wouldn't expect a large amount of the population to get all that simply by exposure by the time they are 18, if at all. Hence we teach arithmetic explicitly and a vast amount of the population can add, subtract, multiply, and divide before they are even teenagers.

&gt;So the statement of,

&gt;&gt;everything should involve types of critical thinking, and it can be implicit to everything you do,

&gt;while certainly correct, does not suggest that it doesn't deserve clear, explicit treatment.

&gt;The difficulty is then ""What exactly should we teach to methodically develop those skills?"" Since 'critical thinking' is a bit of a buzzword and not clearly delineated, it's not entirely clear and I'm hoping to get the education community's thoughts on this. The obvious candidates I see would be logic and rhetoric. Meta-thinking sorts of things.

1374616679.0,78,self.education,1iwwmz,I was a History Teacher at a HS for 4 years before finally quitting in disgust.,145,67,87,http://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/1iwwmz/i_was_a_history_teacher_at_a_hs_for_4_years/,"All my life I have dreamed of being a Teacher and helping people. So, when I got the job at my old HS as the History teacher I was overjoyed, my dream had come true...but, here's the ugly truth: Being a Teacher was the worst 4 years of my life.

My first year was a struggle. Controlling a class of kids who truly did not give a damn was a refugee in audacity. They didn't respect me, they didn't care about learning. They were holding back the ones who did, and nothing was to be done. Teachers were chatty and backstabbing harpies who cared nothing for the Students, and only cared about getting through the day. Did I mention how students couldn't learn because we were forced to spend the entire second half of the semester doing the Standardized testing practices?

I started off as an idealistic rookie and turned into a unforgiving and generally cold person. If my students didn't care why should I? I had thought I had seen it all, but, what really set my gears off was this one kid. His name was Miles, he was 17 and a football player, a typical jock, he didn't care about anything but football, but, shockingly always passed because the school's football team was the more important then anything else. 

I was warned by other teachers to not ""Challenge him and to just let him pass. Why should I let someone unqualified pass the class? So when he earned his first F, I got a very, very angry phone call from his father demanding me to change his grade. Fuck you, I thought, fuck you. I wasn't giving in. Next morning I'm called into the Principals office. He lectures me about how if Miles has an F he can't participate in Football and how I should strongly consider revising his grade to a C at the very least"". 

Yeah, I'll revise it for sure. Come next Test, he once again earned an F, only this time he managed to get one question correct, Woohoo! As I'm entering his grade into the gradebook the Football coach, David comes in. ""heard Miles had a test today. How'd he do?"", i knew this was going to end badly, i knew it, but, i stuck to my guns. I tell him Miles earned an F, and now Miles is failing my class. David looks down to me, ""Now son, weren't you told that Miles needed a passing grade to play? We got a big game coming up and without Miles we're finished. I strongly suggest you change his grade"". So i retort ""Miles earned that F, why should I pass someone who is clearly not capable?"", David sighs and says ""Miles is dumb as a rock and won't accomplish anything in life, but, he can play a mean game of football and damnit we need him to play. Change the fucking grade already"".

I finally give in and let him ""make up"" the test. He now has a C in class, that's good enough to play. Everyone is happy, but, not me. I help him pass his next test, but, I feel guilty I'm letting someone like him pass. I'm still shocked he managed to pass the standardized test, but, moving on, the semester begins to wrap up and we have the final test. I made my test rather easy as to allow him to pass, and what does he manage to do? He fails it miserably getting a 0%, he answered not 1 question correctly. 

I give up on him, I won't let him pass as the final is worth 30% of his grade, and he got a zero on it, theres no way he can pass. Miles is wanting to graduate and go to a State College, he supposedly has been scouted already. As I'm grading the finals Miles comes in, ""So brah how'd I do? Do I graduate""?, he still refuses to call me, Mr, he still talks down to me. I hand him his Final back, ""Did you pass?  I couldn't tell because you answered not 1 question correctly. So no, you didn't pass, you have failed this class and considering your low grades already you won't be graduating"". He turns red, and storms out saying ""My father gunna heart about this"". later that day his father comes up here in Person. He's a big man, 6'4 and buff, he slams his fit onto my desk, ""Why'd you give mah boy an F?"", I'm not intimidated, I show him the paper and then tell him how I made the test easy, and even let him use the book, and he still failed.

He looks down to me, then says ""We'll see about that"". A few days later at graduation, I spot his name on the list. He's graduating? What? I go over to the principal, ""why?"", he snorts and just tells me ""Had to be done. You were going to let him fail"", unbelievable. I took off my gown, and stormed off, told the principal right then and there I quit. I have my morals, a man has to have his morals, and I refuse to let a kid who didn't deserve to graduate, pass.

Quick catch up: I'm a teacher who believes that learning can be made more fun through video games. I posted on reddit sharing about how I turned part of my class into an RPG. The students make characters and go on quests where the work becomes battles with monsters to earn experience (grades) and gold to buy upgrades.

My middle school students had such a good time with it, that my friend and I decided to make a website that could automatically turn school worksheets into an RPG. The goal was to make the site available for other teachers to use, but my fellow teachers thought it wouldn’t translate well in the high school. So I came to reddit for some advice.

**Reddit, thank you.** Your feedback really was inspiring. We have turned my closed classroom RPG into a demo for the general public. [Lessonadventure.com](http://lessonadventure.com) is up and open. There is MUCH work still to be done to transform a project that was useful for *my* class into a real RPG generator.

**What the demo is right now:**

* The demo reflects what is currently possible for teachers to make: stories, monsters, and quizzes

* You will be able to buy armor and pets for your characters

* Some of the awesome art from video game artist Leedin from the mane6 team. I bet you can tell which art is ours vs his ;)

**What we envision for a completed website**

* A rich RPG world, created by either a really hands on teacher, or automatically by script

* Tons of weapons, spells, potions, etc to help characters “cheat,” or help their classmates cooperatively or hurt them competitively

* Ways of serving a wide variety learning styles and not just quiz taking

* A teacher suite that can save educators lots of time grading


Here are some responses to the feedback we received so far:

* We envision Lessonadventure.com to be one of the many tools teachers could use. A Tool +1 perhaps :)

* Many people felt that as long as a game was “required,” it could never be fun in the long term

* There were split opinions on whether it would translate to well to the high school

* Thanks for pointing out that our goal should be to draw the strengths of RPGs to the best parts of education

The plan is to make Lesson Adventure available to teachers and student for the next school year. Thank you very much reddit.

**TL;DR**: I’m a teacher who wanted to make his classroom more like video games. I made a demo for people to try.

In the letter he asked people who were already his friend not to come so he could meet only new people. Instead of meeting some new people, Tyler was forced to withdraw from the University, and labeled by students as unstable. Police even informed Tyler, as they escorted him to University Health Services for a mental health analysis, that students had been threatening to smash him over the head with a bottle. All this young man did was make a bold move to meet people in an environment that does not help at all with the growing of one's social life. He tried to break the sea of cliques which reside at UMass and branch out to meet new people, which is a very tough thing to do for most, but instead of shrugging it off, those who weren't interested labeled him psychotic, unstable, and wierd. The University should reinstate Tyler as a student and issue an apology as soon as possible. It is a travesty that someone who wants to meet new people gets thrown out of school and threatened for trying to do so. (Quoted from change.org - see link below)

Here is a link to an image of Tyler's letter (also posted recently on r/pics) : http://i.imgur.com/FlNm3.jpg

Here is Tyler's statement to the Dean: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rtJpFk0AVYBBXKfPdAcgq6k-_bKSc2sETS-0xxx93HA/edit

An editorial from the school's paper about the University's decision: http://dailycollegian.com/2012/02/01/molander-mishandled-by-administration/

In exchange for agreeing to withdraw from the University, Tyler requested that the administration watch this video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WibmcsEGLKo

Lastly, this link is to a petition to get Tyler reinstated as a student at the school that Tyler called home until recently. Please sign it so he can be back among his friends: http://www.change.org/petitions/university-of-massachusetts-amherst-reinstate-tyler-molander-as-a-student-with-a-full-apology

I've attended modeling workshops for physics and I've spent this past year creating a Modeling Geometry curriculum of my own design. This year was also my 2nd year using Standards-Based Grading and I've been tweaking it since the start. 

At the end of the first semester, I gave the traditional final exam, but with the SBG flair. It was cumbersome to say the least. To fit 25-30 standards onto a single test expanded the test to about 8 pages. In the end, it was a good test in that students were able to finish it and it adequately covered the entire semester. But after 3 days of proctoring finals, I had 2 days to grade 150 exams that were each 8 pages long. Never again. 

So leading up to the end of this semester I had an idea: if the core of SBG is to pinpoint specific content that students have mastered, why bother making them take a final exam full of content that they've already demonstrated proficiency on? Why not let students focus their efforts on only the standards that they've struggled with? 

Here's what I did: I wrote individual assessments for every standard (30 for geometry, 24 for physics and 30 for astronomy). Then I wrote a Google Form to allow students to tell me which standards they'd like to take on the final. Once I sifted through the data, I was able to give each student an exam tailored to their specific needs. The major stipulations were that students had to pick at least 10, and they had to start by picking the standards which hadn't been mastered yet. 

No results yet as the first day of finals was today, but my first impression was that students liked the idea and were overwhelmed at how much time it could take to work through 10 unique, albeit small, assessments.

1363106543.0,66,self.education,1a5kzd,My amazing English teacher from High School gave this address to her School Board about increased security measures following recent school shootings. ,76,10,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/1a5kzd/my_amazing_english_teacher_from_high_school_gave/,"Rather than snivveling about silly policies of The Great They, I thought I'd express myself to them directly.  Last night, I delivered this speech to the school board:
 
 
A few Saturday mornings ago, a former student stopped by my house to enjoy cinnamon rolls with me and my husband.  She asked how things were going out at [our school]—and said she and another former student were planning to drop by and visit a few of their former teachers before Spring Break.  I told her she’d be locked out:  we have new security measures in place.  And then I told her what I’m here to tell you tonight:

I resent the recent emphasis on strengthening security in our building.
Two specific directives are (1) all adults must wear their ID badges at all times in the building and (2) all outside doors will be locked throughout the school day (except the doors to the ag barn, and the main doors by the front office).

These are district policies, apparently arising from an open forum meeting after the Newtown Massacre where many parents spoke out for increased security measures.  Some have even offered the opinion that the right thing to do is to arm teachers—or at least some staff members; criminals are deterred (they would argue) by the presence of deadly resistance.  Last week, South Dakota legalized just such measures... I disagree.  Let me explain why.


In 1999, after the Columbine High School massacre made ‘school shooting’ part of our national vocabulary, I had classroom discussions with my unnerved students.  I encouraged them to express their feelings and concerns.  Many did.  Some began talking of the security measures we might take to protect ourselves, and they got pretty elaborate in their descriptions.  I heard them out.  And then I explained my point of view.
I pointed out to my students that my life, literally, is in their hands every day.  My windowless room has one exit.  It has no adjoining classrooms.  It is a great distance from the front office.  I told my 30+ students that if they collectively decided to beat me to death with chairs—to say nothing of smuggling in knives or firearms—there would be no way on earth I could stop them.

I remember their expressions as they looked around at one another, the truth and reality of what I’d said sinking in.  It is a frightening thought to contemplate.

Next I pointed out that each of them is similarly vulnerable:  If I chose to lead the rest of a willing class in a violent rage against one of them, they’d have even less of a chance of survival than I would.
And then my point:  Does that mean I—or they—walk onto campus every day with the ominous feeling, “Today could be the day I am brutally murdered”?  No.  No.  Adamantly no.  Neither before the Columbine Shootings nor afterwards.  Neither before Newtown nor afterwards.  I choose—I CHOOSE—to love my students instead of fear them.  I choose to model behaviors, language, and attitudes that I find appropriate and conducive to learning.  And I trust them to respond in kind.
I choose to look at the human race in general—and at my students especially—as possessing enormous potential for GOOD, not for evil.

Of course there are wicked men and women in our society.  Of course I take sensible measures to protect myself.  Of course I believe that society’s job is, as Martin Luther King, Jr. said, to protect the robbed and punish the robber.

But the goal of a classroom is not, first and foremost, to protect students from assailants armed with deadly weapons and murderous intent.  The goal of a classroom is to create a climate of trust and inquiry, where risk-taking is a noble and desired trait, and everyone participates, benefits, and ENJOYS being there.

Turning a school into a military fortress is the best thing to do if our paramount objective is to protect our children from lunatics wielding firearms.  But I choose not to let lunatics drive MY reality.  I know that there are madmen in the world, but I choose to love my students anyway.  And no, a loaded weapon in my desk drawer does not facilitate that relationship.  In fact, I find it absolutely antithetical to it.  I can’t both encourage, accept, and trust—AND fear, analyze the area for threats, and be ever on the ready to take down a shooter.
Given my druthers, I’d unlock all the outside doors.  I love that [our school] is a place—or used to be—where alums—who “have no business on campus”—can (and used to!) drop in on their old teachers during a school day.

I want a school—and I believe I HAVE a school—where the students know who I am even when I am NOT wearing a photo ID.
If the first goal of schools is safety—and this is proudly touted as “Our #1 Priority!”—then, by all means, it makes total sense to arm us to the teeth, put in metal detectors, and all the rest. (I also pointed out in my post-Columbine classroom discussions, that this ‘enforcement of safety’ is precisely the full-time job of prison guards (of whom at the time I had three in my family) who are, notwithstanding their single-minded vigilance, nevertheless UNsuccessful at eradicating violence.)
But I am sort of passionate about MY job, and I believe that the paramount objective of a school is to educate.  To teach.  To foster learning.  And that happens when we build relationships.  ALL the policies and regulations and decisions we make should bear THAT principle in mind.

I’ll take the bullet.  Just let me love and teach my students, and don’t let’s pretend that my wearing a silly name badge does anything whatsoever to protect us from intruders.  It certainly does nothing to help my students learn.",,False,,t5_2qhlm,False,,,True,t3_1a5kzd,http://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/1a5kzd/my_amazing_english_teacher_from_high_school_gave/,

The sidebar says this:

&gt;Teaching, learning, developing wisdom. The news, practice and politics of education. Technology and education.

I have no problem with some healthy debate about the politics of education - this can happen without constantly posting *opinion* pieces.  If you want real discussion, post a real study or some real news and start a conversation in the comments.  Most of you are far more eloquent than the bloggers you link to anyway.

I have been a popular and successful teacher for the past 14 years.  Because of new anti-union laws passed by the republican government in Michigan, my principal was able to abuse her power and have me laid off because she didn't like me.  She did not follow the correct protocol when she evaluated me.  She will not even entertain the notion that she may have been wrong.  Because of her evaluation of me, I was laid off.  My district is doing all sorts of shady things like not recalling teachers, and posting jobs externally when there are still people who have devoted themselves to the district on layoff.  In the meantime, I am not doing what I love, and other districts are not hiring people with experience because they do not want to pay higher salaries.  I'm really scared that I will lose my home, and my insurance, which is important, because I am a breast cancer survivor.  I've been having anxiety attacks on a daily basis.  

Has anyone gone through something like this?  It feels like I am in a living nightmare!  How do I get over the hurt and anger I feel?  I am a good teacher, and do not deserve this to be happening to me right now!!!

------------

I can't believe this but I'm actually going to write a defense of school IT administrators since a lot of people are dumping on them. I've never worked in a school district but I work with a vendor who does a lot of work with districts and their departments. Like any other position, I've worked with school IT departments where I've thought ""They don't get paid half what they're worth"" and I've worked with others where I've thought ""You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy."" Regardless of which kind works in your school's IT department you probably have no idea what they're up against. I can guarantee that the people who do the staffing budgets are clueless. Here's a taste school IT from 15 years ago vs. today. We'll create a theoretical school district of 5000 kids:

15 years ago:

Staff - 3 or 4. A Novell guy, a Windows guy, 2 help desk guys, and no network people (seriously, how hard is it to plug in a 10 Mbps hub and watch the collision light blink like it's Christmas Eve in Times Square.

Network - Probably 1 central IT closet per school for everything. A few switches, mainly to handle the office staff and the computer lab at each school. Most classrooms don't have computers so that simplifies the cabling/network infrastructure. Little or no routing/firewalling since in 1997-1998 you may or may not have given most computers internet access out your ridiculously expensive but lightening fast T1. If the switches die, few are affected.

Phones - Key systems or PBX. Probably not maintained by the school itself, but by a vendor. Phones in the office areas, cafeteria, and a few other key locations. If the PBX goes down...you have no phones until the repair guy shows up.

Wireless - You meant like RC cars?

Systems - A Novell file and print server that may run a simple gradebook app and allow basic file storage.

Network and Systems Monitoring - Examples: ""Hey Joe, is the collision light solid?"" ""Hey Joe, is the server powered up?""

Student Connectivity - Most likely none. You have no personal devices and the computers in the labs, library, etc probably have a single login specific to that computer.


Today:

Staff - 5 or 6. A Windows guy, a basic network/phones guy, and the rest are probably help desk with some elevated AD privileges.

Network - Several closets to distribute the network load. Routing, VLANs, firewalls, etc. are now a significant part of the infrastructure. QoS is a big deal in a place like a school. Failover and redundancy are a must since all systems are now considered critical. You will spend a lot of time looking for bottlenecks (get a good monitoring solution - more systems to be responsible for)

Phones - Most likely VoIP (or will be soon). This adds load, complexity, and QoS requirements on what was a simple network back in the day. Failover and redundancy are a must since all systems are now considered critical. Integrated paging, chat/video clients like MS Lync or Cisco Presence/Jabber. Presence can add a ridiculous amount of complexity depending on how paranoid your users are. Cordless phones have been replaced with wifi-based VoIP phones. Yes, Voice over latency-prone overtaxed wireless is a great idea. Make it work!! Softphones - Every teacher should be able to take their calls from anywhere - more setup and maintenance.

Wireless - EVERYWHERE. I usually see at least 1 AP per classroom and they're all over the common areas. Why? Because school systems have been suckered into giving everyone a Windows laptop, a Macbook, a iPad, a wireless printer, etc. in addition to allowing users to connect their personal devices to a guest network. Companies face this issue but they tend to be more security/resource conscious than schools since companies are money-making entities. Schools assume that if Company X (looking at you Apple) drops a demo device off and it works on the wifi then having 500 of them in the building should be no different.

Systems - A SAN or two, large VMWare infrastructure, 4-5 AD Domain Controllers, Exchange, print server, file servers, 15-20 application servers (all different and you have to know them all), video camera recording servers, tons of storage, a user account for every student in the high schools Imagine if 1/4 of your company left every year all at the same time and were immediately replaced by the same number of people and you were responsible for archiving/deleting the old accounts and creating the new ones...for every system they need. Now imagine you're a college and your semester turnover rate was 4000 people - all leaving at the same time or arriving at the same time. That's a crapload of knowledge you have to sqeeze into a small band of underpaid individuals.

Network and System Monitoring - You'd better be monitoring your systems, all of them. Resource utilization, error logs, warnings, intrusion detection, etc. More work.

Student Connectivity - Schools are now giving out laptops for homework and iPad in place of physical textbook, plus allowing kids to connect to guest networks. Now that content is being delivered wirelessly I've seen requests from school districts wanting to handle thousands of people in one location (auditorium, etc) all receiving streaming content. I've seen requests asking that every student in every classroom be able to stream HD content simultaneously. Kids get district-run web pages to dole out homework, may have VPN accounts for access to district systems to do other work, the list goes on and on.

The biggest problem is that districts are more than happy to spend the money on infrastructure that gets them what they need. But when the IT departments ask for additional staff to cover the explosion of systems and infrastructure they get a blank stare. It's very much an ""out of sight, out of mind"" issue. If they don't see the infrastructure then it must not take anything to maintain it. On the other hand they can see the football team so they must need an 8th coach.

So before we dump on school IT departments in general, let's stop and look at the number of systems that we expect them to handle, the number of people we're willing to give them to support those systems, and the amount of money districts are willing to pay. When you want someone who can handle a SAN, VMWare, AD, Exchange, 15 other systems, the network, phones, wireless, etc. you'd better be willing to pony up because as soon as they get all that experience they're worth at least twice what the district will pay.

I wanted to know because right now I'm working at a school for special needs children. I'm a music education major and was lucky enough to have a supportive boss who let me take off some of my teacher aide responsibilities to design and implement a music class (2x a week.) It's been pretty incredible, and for the last 6 weeks I've gotten to know how to accomodate children with disabilities as well as communicate with them so much better than any school work could have prepared me (I'm currently entering my 4th year of college, going on to student teaching this coming semester). So my question is  - what was/were the most important things that you learned from your first year? Did teaching meet your expectations? How did you adjust to the difference between practice &amp; theory?

Thanks and I look forward to reading your guys' responses!

Michael Deshotels is a retired teacher who now spends his time actively fighting the piss poor education reform currently going on in Louisiana. He does not represent a union. He simply posts to his blog and contacts teachers around the state on a regular basis to rally support for the fight. 

Background:
Boby Jindal (Louisiana Governor) has spent the last few years privatizing our school system, creating ambigious and impossible accountability programs, and underhandedly passing what he wants done. When a politician has opposed his actions they have been removed and replaced with someone on ""Jindal's team."" This isn't an issue of political affiliation. It seems to simply be Jindal's fight for a Romney sized education reform to put on his resume for the Presidential primary. I have not talked to one teacher or school board member around the state who agrees with what's happening in Louisiana's education system at the moment. We have needed reform for a long time...this is not it.

An Education Revolution,80,25,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/1dbeod/help_mit_students_start_an_education_revolution/,"Imagine a kid in Kansas, excited by the film industry, but without resources or a mentor. Imagine that child being matched with a film expert in LA, who talks to her twice a week about ideas, resources, and connections. Now, imagine that extending to children with all sorts of passions and ideas, all over the world. We're linking innovative vision with experience to help students believe in the power of their own ideas! 

A heliostat, a retina, plant regeneration, and music- all of these are just a sample of the subjects that are going to be taught on the pilot mission of Start!, our project for the MIT Ideas Global Challenge! This summer, we're biking ACROSS THE US to meet kids from all over and create a national idea-sparking movement :) And we're taking this GLOBAL in the fall!

Check out this short video summarizing our vision here:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hv0YmEbaT4&amp;feature=youtu.be

Start! is dedicated to inspiring young minds: from our experience teaching, we have observed that children have an ability to clearly identify problems and questions that they’d like to address, but that they often lack the experience and self-belief to act on their ideas. We are working to create a global network of mentors who will be matched with the students we teach to:

1) Encourage and inspire them to pursue their passions and love learning

2) Believe that they can play an active role in creating the world in which they will grow up and spend their lives

**Here's where we need your help:** To give every student the best possible experience we need you to **vote** for us in the Ideas Global Challenge and help us win $11,500 to change education the world over:

http://globalchallenge.mit.edu/teams/view/434

1347059957.0,50,self.education,zj4j6,"UPDATE: After 2 weeks with my super-large kindergarten class, I am seriously thinking about quitting. ",59,9,74,http://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/zj4j6/update_after_2_weeks_with_my_superlarge/,"So, it is Friday and I am at home trying to figure out what the fuck I am going to do.  I have been at this school, in the same district for 7 years and its just seems to me that the way it is operated is ridiculous.  Maybe I am wrong, maybe it is like this everywhere? 

Right now, it is nearly impossible to get anything meaningful accomplished.  On PE day it takes us nearly 30 minutes to get ready because they all have to use the RR and tie shoes...that's how long it takes 38, 5-year-olds to get ready with only the help of two adults.  There is little communication from the administration but, through the grape vine, we heard that we are going to get two new teachers, but here's the catch: it will take at least 3 more weeks, they will only be taking 10 students from each class, we will have to share our furniture (like tables, chairs, cubbies...) with the new classes for the first few weeks while furniture is being ordered, and we will also have to rotate our assistants for the first month.  

So, the first month and a half of school we will be dealing with 38 kids, then 28, which is still a lot, but without enough furniture or manpower to accommodate them all, which was part of the problem with having 38? 

On top of everything, on the first day of school one of the girls in the class started majorly acting out, like throwing chairs, flipping the rug, knocking down things, -oh- and she even spit in two kids' faces!  During the parent conference, she openly mocked her mom.  

There is very little we can do about behavior issues at my school and usually I can handle them quite well on my own, but with this little gem and 37 others (8 ESL, 6 other major behavior issues), it is chaos!  I feel like the ""whole beginning of school"" time period in which you establish the expectations has been totally messed up and I am not sure we can recover.  

I don't know what to do.  The past two years at this school have been hell and this year is shaping up to be no different, despite new leadership.  Should I call it quits and keep my sanity? Should I suck it up, wear all black, and be mean as hell?  Would your school treat this situation any differently?

1318604957.0,52,self.education,lc43x,Teachers help me out - Is this an email you'd like to receive from a parent? (x-post from /teaching),68,16,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/lc43x/teachers_help_me_out_is_this_an_email_youd_like/,"I'm trying to set the example for my son that I've only recently began raising. His mother has done well at reinforcing bad habits.
Am I doing this right?

**First Email**

I received your message about my son's Science grade. I appreciate you contacting me about it.
Are there particular areas that [my son] needs to work on? Any material that we could study at home that would help him in class?
I would have called but the office advised you were teaching today. I am free all day tomorrow if you have the time, please call me at xxx.xxx.xxxx.
In your message, you mentioned [my son] grade was previously an F and is now up to a D+. He seems to understand the material but might be having difficulty with tests.
If you could provide copies of his tests/quizzes reflecting his grades, I would greatly appreciated it.
In speaking with [my son] about this, he seemed frustrated. I'd like to approach this from a different angle.
Thank you for your time.

**Second Email**

I'm not concerned with giving him another opportunity to take the test again.
He insists he knows the material. I'd like to show him his tests with his answers and his grade. I think he needs to see that whether or not he knows the material, he needs to be able to show he knows the material by passing tests.
I want to go over his answers with him and show him they were not correct and that is why he has the grade he does.
I think giving him a second chance to retake tests/quizzes would show he doesn't have to do things right the first time.
A little history on [my son]: Up until August of last year he lived with his mother in Washington. He's had very little supervision and boundaries until he and his sister were transferred to my custody. Last year, we went through the same issues.
He has not been reliable with getting his homework done and bringing home what he needs to. He is extremely reluctant to do homework or study at all. He may well attend summer school after this year but for now I need to show him you and I are not divided about what he needs to do.
He needs to see he is required to complete his work or pay the price, both in his grades and a loss of his free time. He also needs to see it doesn't come easily. He views studying as something you do when you don't understand something, not necessarily what you do to go over material again before a test.
I can understand I've given you a lot to take in. I expect you have a few hundred students to worry about. For now, I only have one student to worry about and I need your help.
I've been having issues accessing the school's blackboard system. That should be resolved today. I'll use that to keep an eye on what he should be doing at home, especially when it comes to studying before tests.
The sooner I can show where he's not measuring up, the sooner I can hold him accountable.
Thank you for your time.",,False,,t5_2qhlm,False,,,True,t3_lc43x,http://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/lc43x/teachers_help_me_out_is_this_an_email_youd_like/,

Stop, you know, meaning a complete PAUSE in all sectors.

Last year there was a large revindication in the sector of **education**, from university teachers who were asking for better job conditions. The teachers are **highly devaluated** in Brazil. This year, the government implemented a **large** reduction on the investments towards education, mainly affecting teachers. A lot of teachers and federal universities (which are the best ones in Brazil, in terms of quality of education) currently are in a state of general strike action (greve), which has been up for a week and a half, by now. 

But this ain't a small number. We currently have *more than 44 universities in greve*, affecting more than one million students. If you are asking why Brazil is being stopped, just by education, I'd rather say that subway workers were also recently in a greve that has just ended. **We are in a state of chaos. We need help.**

Please, fellow redditors, spread this news. Brazilian students and teachers need to be heard, the government must give better conditions, and we must not stop having classes. This is a very, very important matter, and I, as well as my fellow brazillian colleagues, would appreciate your attention.

One of the best arguments for using the International System of Units (SI) is the alternative—an incoherent collection of confusing and arbitrary units that are only officially used in three countries worldwide: the USA, Liberia and Myanmar. This system means that many people (mostly Americans) are ignorant of the quantitative information we use. We are unable to communicate information, relate measurements to other information or make what should be basic calculations.

What should be a simple conversion ends up being this: *1 U.S. gallon = 231 cubic inches = 128 U.S. fluid ounces = 256 tablespoons = 768 teaspoons = 16 cups = 8 U.S. fluid pints = 4 U.S. fluid quarts = 1/31.5 U.S. federal barrel = 1/42 oil barrel = 1/55 drum* - How does one even use that? The Imperial system forces students to learn complex definitions, conversions and equations that are at best illogical. It puts students at an extreme competitive disadvantage in science, technology and international business where metric is the only accepted standard of measure.
 
In 2000, professional organizations like the National Council for Teachers of Mathematics and the National Education Association adopted the position that metric should be the “primary measurement system” in schools. Ten year later and we have made no progress. Students are taught metric, but find no use for it outside of the classroom, the STEM fields and communication with the rest of the world.

The question is: Why have we failed to implement the metric system? What can we do (especially those in education) to better prepare our students for understanding and using the metric system. More importantly, how can we help influence the USA at large to finally adopt the metric system?

I love you.  My children love you.  This year, however has been an abysmal nightmare for all of us, because NOT ONE DAY has gone by in this entire school year that was not in some way shaped by these %^$@#$#!! standardized tests and their content.  THEIR ENTIRE SCHOOL YEAR from SEPTEMBER UNTIL NOW has focused on the knowledge required in order to successfully negotiate a ""passing grade"" for the school.

My daughter has the same teacher my son had last year (2nd grade); and I can tell you that from last year to this, the overall content in this incredible, inspiring classroom has been thinned out, cut down, or outright deleted, all in order to promote this required testing.

My son's class has spent the entire year focusing not just on normal 3rd grade activities and knowledge, but on a rather adult formula for the composition and comprehension of essays and passages - and I have to tell you that as an adult with a BA in English, **I** have trouble comprehending the objective of this ridiculousity (I made that up:  Ridiculousity = Ridiculousness + the velocity at which it is achieved) (I do things like that, and so do my kids).

Teachers, **PLEASE** tell me you hate this as much as I do.  And for the sake of our entire country's collective intelligence, **PLEASE** tell me what we have to do to fix it.



**EDIT:  responding as follows:**

My initial post was a rant, so ranting is completely acceptable -- I tend to consider rants to be a passionately intelligent expression of frustration, usually over something one has spent a great deal of time and effort thinking in circles about -- they're worthy of attention. 

Thank you for your thoughtful replies.  I have been contemplating all of them over several days (curse of the layman!), and have come up with the following thoughts.  Please forgive my ignorance of the details of a teaching career, I am speaking to you as a concerned parent and nothing more:

First and foremost, I will most likely be starting a letter crusade.  Right after I research those dollar amounts and compare them to education spending.

One thread here discussed student tech schools.  If these schools are so desirable to students, maybe it should be possible to incorporate portions of their curriculum in more standard schools.  Maybe our focus needs to shift off of getting every student into college -- because some of us are poorly suited to it, some of us can't afford it, and some of us just don't want to go -- and shift on to actually getting students the skills they need to find jobs that give them room to breathe, grow, and survive.  And once they have those jobs or that knowledge, they get a certificate and move on.  Unsatisfied later? Make it easy for them to go back to school, learn more or learn something new.  I agree that this should be possible, and for all ages.

From An_Album_Cover:

&gt;Teachers should be advocates for their students with the power and autonomy to change how we do things. Administrators should be advocates for their teachers, and superintendents should be advocates for their administrators. This agency organization is not how our schools currently operate ... ...

I am curious (with little or no experience in this regard) about how much of a role the Teachers' Unions could play in re-setting this structural impediment.  I am not sure if a private school teacher has Union access? So I am not certain if this question is relevant to An_Album_Cover specifically, but I wanted to throw it out there -- if the majority of teachers happen to feel this way (and that is something you would have to fight out amongst yourselves), then isn't the role of the Union to advocate for the teachers? Couldn't one of the inherent rights of an employee be having the ability to perform a job in a manner consistent with the amount of education and experience they have accumulated and applied to themselves in order to do the job properly? And if it isn't, shouldn't it be?  Otherwise, what is the point of all the required schooling? If not, what is the point in pursuing further knowledge, or learning from peers and academic reviews, and conferences?

Furthermore, what is the point in all the time taken outside of the classroom by the people who do the most work in it, if not to be able to categorize and improve upon the needs and abilities of their students and classrooms?  How can we ask you, our teachers, to accomplish, care for, and recognize so much, without giving you autonomous situations tempered, perhaps, by guidelines (general course content) and requirements (definitions of categories of passing grades)? Do you not have the right to demand such a situation?

In any other job, you could quit, find a new office, find a new business, and move on, while still remaining within the field into which you have put so much time and effort.  I don't think teaching is like that.  My impression of teaching is that changing jobs does not alleviate the sense of having your hands tied behind your back.  Sometimes you exchange the butcher's twine and barbed wire for velvet cuffs, but you are still restrained.  I so thoroughly admire your tenacity and thank you for it.

Sincerely,

The school he attends has one male teacher and by all accounts I can see is a great teacher. He took over the leadership group, volunteered to coach more than one sports team for the students, is liked by his students and so on. 

What blows my mind is that the parents of the students in the school are trying to get him fired. Why? Because he gives out too much homework to the children and 'obviously' doesn't understand their limitations. The parents (okay, honestly the mothers) in the neighbourhood are going door to door trying to get everyone to sign a petition to have him removed from this school. 

My client refused to sign and after a few words, she shut the door on a fellow mothers face. Now the whole neighbourhood won't talk to her or her son. When I went to her house, I passed some ladies on the sidewalk who shook their head at me when I went up the driveway. 

I am blown away. I don't know if this is just about the teacher being the only male, or if these mothers need somebody to pick on, but I find it insane. In my opinion, how is giving homework to 5th graders a bad thing?

To clarify a few things: The amount of homework is having a page or two of reading, or filling out some fill in the blanks, ect. And doing so more than once a week. This is what is considered ""too much"".

This is in Okanagan, BC, Canada.

Perhaps, but *isn't it in the best interests of society for everyone to get the ultimate education*?

First off, only consider education if it is the thing you actually want to do. Education is not a job that will get you money or appreciation. It is a physically and emotionally exhausting job. In Texas (which is one of the weakest states for education), teachers are required to attend at least thirty hours of workshops (almost always boring) every year to keep their certification. So yes, you get holidays and summers off, but they are almost always taken up with grading, planning, and workshops. And though the pay is getting better, teaching is never going to make you a lot of money. If not for my husband's job, I wouldn't have nearly everything I'm able to. There will be people who love to tell you that teachers go into education simply because they can't make it in any other field. There are plenty of people, too, who think that teachers don't work hard and get plenty of time off. Of course those people are wrong, but you'll almost never be able to change their minds.

Secondly, if you decide to go into education, be sure you decide on the age group and subject you genuinely want to teach. I've taught almost all levels and ages, but I know I most enjoy teaching high school students. Above that, I've even learned I like Juniors most. I've seen teachers who aren't teaching the level they're best with, and they and their students suffer because of it. The same goes for teaching the subject you like. Especially if you decide to teach just one subject; it needs to be something you are enthusiastic enough about that you can repeatedly teach it up to six times a day.

Ultimately, if you realize education is what you want to do, I strongly suggest taking as many psychology courses as you can. It really helps to understand why students do what they do (even if they don't know why they're doing it). Psychology classes also help you develop your classroom management, which is just as important (or even more than) knowing your subject matter. You'll need to develop a thick skin, too. Students, other teachers, and parents can hurt your feelings almost daily if you take things personally. 

The positives I can tell you, though, are that education is such a great way to make a positive impact on the world. Students literally look to you for teaching them and helping them discover the people they are becoming. It is your chance to become immortal because the changes you make to some students will continue to their children and so on. I can't imagine myself doing anything but teaching, and I love it even on the most difficult of days.

I'm always happy for you to come observe my classes or ask further questions. Good luck in your decisions :)",,False,,t5_2qhlm,False,,,True,t3_arplf,http://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/arplf/my_advice_to_a_former_student_considering_teaching/,

What should I do?,50,7,42,http://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/170dt5/student_makes_inappropriate_comments_about_school/,"End of the day this Friday, 10 minutes before the bell.  I've got 4-5 students in class when a kid says something to the effect of 'That school shooting (Sandy Hook) was awesome!  I wish I had done that.'

This is a kid that never bathes, smokes so much dope that he reeks of it, can't read and is covered in shitty self-applied tattoos.  He's made comments about how much he loves violence and smoking pot in the past.  I usually try to limit the amount of attention the comments get.  Most kids just roll their eyes at him.  No one takes him seriously and when he made the comments I just told him they were inappropriate and moved on.

Now that I've had time to think about them I wonder if I shouldn't do more.  Honestly, I can't see this kid bringing a gun to school, but in this hyper-sensitive environment, should I make a bigger deal about his comments?  He's been in and out of juvenile detentions centers and this is the first time he's spent any significant time in a classroom.  I feel like we're really starting to make a little progress and I'd hate to see him sent back to Juvie for saying something ignorant.  Because that's just what he is, ignorant.

I'm definitely informing my administrator of the comments, but I don't know if I should do more.

Any thoughts?

Some aren't going to get the jobs they thought they'd get, and some are going back to school.

I was talking to my friend Tim the other day and he said he would have liked to know the placement rates and speed of debt repayment over a few years after graduation before he started his program.  He said he felt that the university got a lot out of him, but he didn't get much back in terms of job opportunities.  I cannot verify this for sure, but he claimed that the university provided him with an unrealistically rosy view of his major.  He was told of opportunities which clearly did not exist in his field (history).  He now has lots of student debt, and very few options.  In short, he felt he wasn't well informed about the possible pitfalls of his major, and had he known, he might have made a better choice.  

Maybe its the fact that I go to a large state school, but it seems negligent to let kids spend 4 years getting degrees just so they can go back to school and/or be no better off than they were without informing them of the risks.

If you're buying a house, and there is damage to it, it is required by law that you are informed of the damage etc so you know exactly what you're getting into.  Since college nowadays costs almost the same as a small house, how is it fair that the university doesn't have to inform you of the risk that you're taking?  There's a lot at stake.  

**The question(s):  Should the university be required to inform you of job/debt statistics before you select your major?  And should the university be obliged to direct you to an independent and realistic prediction of the job field in relation to your major?  **",,False,,t5_2qhlm,True,,,True,t3_gzprp,http://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/gzprp/should_the_university_be_forced_to_inform_you/,

I want to create an environment, small at first, to develop people by means of employing good **mentors** instead of good teachers. By mentors I mean people that can teach, be fun and provide support (much like the difference between management and leadership). 

I want to do this by

1. Putting teachers in control

2. Building the structures from grassroots, consulting with teachers to get the most effective admin side of things

3. Having standardised testing, but the teachers are in control of what they teach.

4. Build a school that attracts the elite in fun teaching 

I have always been of the opinion that teacher shape the way kids learn about stuff. So I want to start a school where the funding is decided by the teacher, each gets a budget they have to use by the end of a term on fields trips and experiments and engaging activities. The opportunity for extra funding for super special stuff would be there but the mentor would ask the school to sort it and they would go away and look into it for them.

I want to move away form a curriculum focused school, albeit there will have to be assessment, the teacher will be given the option to choose the syllabus they teach and find or create the appropriate qualification. Fuck the prestige of AQA or OCR, they pigeon hole teachers into teaching stuff they don't understand or want to teach. Also students need tailored education, I don't know how many times we need to see a video about ""wrights law"" or hear the story of a prodigy left behind by closed-minded standardized schooling.

Removing standardisation does come with its issues, like how can you assess everyone based on differing qualities of teaching, but we need to move away from this mentality. The way schooling has been structured is essentially a filtered down version of 'how to get into University in 13 steps'. 

Not everyone wants to or should go into University. Some would be better in apprenticeships etc. School should be providing the morals, knowledge and direction to a child so that they can effectively choose where to go when they leave.

Initially it will have to start small, so maybe renting a lecture theatre or house to teach in, but the idea would be that, by funding or otherwise, people could subscribe to the class like in the US and receive the most fun engagaing lessons they have ever had because the school puts the teachers at the top. 

With this in mind, it obviously follows that we attract the elite in teaching, giving the most fun and engaging lessons that really resonate with students. 

Call me quixotic, but I feel with proper planning and use of a hive mind like reddit and almost creating the ""open-source school"" we can change the face of teaching.

I don't think it is personnel problem like some people do; many of our administrators are capable, insightful, and full of skill--rather, I think there is some systemic cause to how leadership is crafted in public education that leads to its problems.

Unfortunately, many have thought that a new ""business approach"" to education is the answer, but this again misses the mark, and from my experience isn't all that business-like.  People advocating this approach usually just mean a blinding focus on bottom-line outcomes with an absolute faith that monetary carrots-and-sticks will solve the problem  (through attrition and exultation).  As a former business person, lots of companies have tried this and failed--in fact, most.  Bottom lines and monetary controls, BY THEMSELVES, almost guarantee failure.

I love what I'm doing, I can definitely see myself teaching or working within the field of education for the rest of my life, no question.  HOWEVER, I think the unpaid internship is BS....I'm calling BS right now.  I have taken over as the primary teacher in all class blocks.  I am doing my own planning, grading, assessments, etc.  I am in the building from 7am until almost 5pm every day.  My exhausted ass is in bed by 9 every night.  I play trumpet in my University's pep band which means I am usually busy on the weekends.  

Basically, I don't have time for a second job...

I'm not asking for my internship to pay me half a teacher salary, or even minimum wage... It is just frustrating to me that I drive 200 miles a week yet I am barely able to earn enough money to pay for gas.  And with gas prices rising, money is just going to add to the stressful life of intern teaching....

**TL;DR:** Yup, I vented.  I wish unpaid internships would at the very least reimburse gas...

**EDIT:** Thanks for all the support, everyone!  I know that the internship is just part of the process to becoming a teacher and that everyone else has gone through this as well.  I'm treating my internship as a job, and I love my job! I can't wait until I start getting paid to do this! =D

**EDIT 2:** Playing in the pep band is a quasi-second job.  We get $20/game. There aren't enough games for the money to serve as a real income though.  When I signed up and committed to pep band, I had no idea how busy I would be with student teaching and I assumed that I would be able to work enough hours at the restaurant I work at.  I found out that I just don't have the time to do student teaching, pep band, and work.  I can't re-neg on my commitment to pep band until after the season is over so I'm stuck for the next few weeks...

University of phoenix is the most well known. They cost twice as much as private not for profit institutions and often leave people with a degree that is practically worthless. For example, nursing students were never taken to a hospital, and thus have no experience. Students get stuck with hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt, and can't get a job because the schools aren't accredited. They spend 20-30% of their money on advertising and only 10% on teachers. Once a school is accredited it leverages the federal government FAFSA, and thus all tax payers to give out student loans, so they can trick the uneducated and poor into believing an education is their solution to all their problems.  I was considering university of Phoenix, but now that I see the corruption that is running these systems will not.

I teach music at a junior high school in a very conservative state. My first year of teacher (several years ago) the pay was bad, but I thought, ""I can make do for a few years until I move over on the pay scale."" That same year the state decided to cut spending on education due to a failing economy, and our salary schedule has been frozen ever since. 

Every time I hear anyone talk about the broken education system, or post something griping about a teacher, I feel so personally attacked.  I started my career feeling so excited, and still have moments that I love, but overall I feel cynical and jaded. A few kids are really amazing people, but the majority can be shits, and several will just end up in jail when they eventually drop out of school. It is so exhausting fighting for their future, and feeling like I get nothing in return. I've given up my hobbies because they cost too much, and my free time after school because I have to coach sports to help pay student loan debt. Any time I try to do something unique and exciting for my music kids (which usually involves taking them out of school for a performance) i get endless griping from the other teachers. I feel stuck in a no-win circumstance.

I've been applying for jobs in other fields, but am pretty sure people see ""teacher"" on my resume and assume I baby-sit all day. I can't even find time to make call backs because I work through my lunch break, work with kids during my prep and coach after school.

But hey, I have summers off. Fuck yeah. Makes it all worth it, right?

Now off to make another drink. :)",,False,,t5_2qhlm,False,,,True,t3_1au2wh,http://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/1au2wh/teacher_rant/,
