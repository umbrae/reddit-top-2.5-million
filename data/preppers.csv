1364514950.0,86,self.preppers,1b7kx7,Advice from a military prepper.,94,8,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/preppers/comments/1b7kx7/advice_from_a_military_prepper/,"I've been lurking in this subreddit for a while and I applaud the cohesiveness and willingness to dole out help to those new to prepping.  Being a senior NCO in the U.S Army, I've seen combat and have some advice for those just starting out.  There are a few items that are essential to any bug out or get home bag that I rarely see listed on here but soldiers in the field always have packed.

Not that it probably matters to those here, but the reason that I prep is not because I fear an economic collapse or natural disasters.  I prep because of what I have seen in war.  I have seen locals completely unprepared for what their country and community had rapidly become.  I have also seen the ingenuity that combatants have demonstrated to kill or disrupt soldiers on the ground.  My true fear is a foreign nation or terrorist cell launching a nuclear weapon to create an EMP, disabling electronics and the power grid across the country.  I am also confident that many of these weapons, along with terrorists with the intelligence to operate them, are more available then we would like to believe.  

However, I am getting away from my point.  Here is a small list of things that everyone should have.

Ziplock bags - 3 small and 3 gallon size.
They take up almost no space, are extremely light weight and serve a million different purposes.  They can be used to waterproof gear, collect water and edibles, and I have seen first hand a gallon size used to treat a sucking chest wound.

Zipties - at least 10
Once again, small, lightweight and extremely versatile.

Baby wipes - 
No soldier would ever be in the field without them.  Use to field wash, as toilet paper and many other uses. BTW, always use unscented.  And only use unscented soap and deodorant, mosquitos and other bugs are attracted to strong scents.

Waterproof bag - 1
http://www.armysurpluswarehouse.com/packs-duffles-bags/laundry-bags/gi-issue-military-waterproof-bag.html

Line your Bug Out/Get Home bag with one to keep all your clothing and equipment dry.  It's standard operating procedure in the Army but I have seen to many civilians neglect this.  Worse case senario, use a trash bag, preferably a heavy duty contractor bag. 

Contractor Bag - 3

Available at any hardware store.  Extremely versatile and lightweight.
You can even cut it to make a tarp.  

Duct tape - 1 roll

I prefer the black gorilla tough tape, but same concept.

Headlamp

An absolute necessity!  I rarely use my flashlight, it's always better to have your hands available.  **However**: Make sure you buy one that has red light as well.  I prefer the Energizer Pro 7.  For those unaware, Red light is much less visible at a distance and preserves your night vision much better.  In the field, we ONLY use red light.

Magnesium Fire starter

If you absolutely need a fire, these are the best way to do so.  Magnesium burns much hotter that wood and will allow you to start a fire much quicker.

A couple other notes, don't pack multiple MRE's.  Field strip them down (remove the plastic and cardboard boxes, you should be able to fit 3 MRE's into one MRE bag.

Watch cap and gloves

It gets cold at night....

Of course, there are other things as well, and my list is only intended to subsidize your current bag.  BTW, get a decent bag.  My assault pack, a Spec-Ops T.H.E has been through 3 deployments and though a little dirty, has never ripped or torn even with the abuse I have put it through.

I don't think I am alone in my opinion that National Geographic heavily slants the tone and accuracy of the content of 'Doomsday Preppers' to make the members of our community seem like, at best, eccentric horders and at worst, murderous psychopaths.  I understand their motivations and all, they have to produce a show that will get the best ratings and earn money... but it is at our expense.

It would be a simple task to create a Youtube channel for it (yes, I know a number of Preppers already have their individual channels).  No, I don't expect to get anywhere near the exposure that DDP gets as they have air time on a mainstream network, but that's not what it is about.

I'm thinking along the lines of 'by Preppers, for Preppers'.  There are a number of ways to help make it community-driven, perhaps to generate the questions for part of the video dialogue AMA posts could be set up for each (individual / group / family) and the community would sort out what they want to ask with their collective upvotes.

For video each Prepper (those who are willing) could take shoot own video, showing their preps to whatever extent they are willing to show everyone.  Obviously some people would choose not to show / talk about some things for OpSec.

Maybe phone interviews could be set up to cover the Q&amp;A sessions generated by the AMAs?

Perhaps we could add a 'community review' portion at the end, also generated from the AMA with things like ""hey, you can get your aquaponics supplies cheaper form this company"" or ""nice doorframe re-enforcement for your home security but there are still those glass windows, have you heard of these security laminates?"" or ""you might want to consider swapping out those 'lifeboat ration' type food bars in your BOB for something better, they don't have very good nutritional value.""

1368395585.0,41,self.preppers,1e7f8o,BOB / INCH/ GHB,48,7,37,http://www.reddit.com/r/preppers/comments/1e7f8o/bob_inch_ghb/,"Over the past few months the idea of a Bug Out Bag (BOB) or I'm Never Coming Home Bag (INCH) has come up a number of times here in /r/preppers. I haven't been entirely satisfied with any of the ones that I have seen. They all seemed to be missing something. This is my Get Home Bag (GHB). It could easily double as a BOB if I had to use it that way. It stays in my vehicle at all times. Since I had to pull it out of the car to update it for warmer weather I decided to completely disassemble it and take pictures.

My GHB is designed to be able to get me home from about 250 miles away if I have to walk. There isn't enough food to really last the walk home from the maximum range but I expect that I would be able to supplement that along the way. Even if I can't there is enough food that I wouldn't starve by any stretch.

There are a few items which are not pictured which I have with me whenever I am traveling. The primary reason that I travel is because I am a rifle marksmanship instructor for [Appleseed](http://appleseedinfo.org). Since they are technically not a part of the bag itself I am only going to list them: hiking boots, sleeping bag, full first aid kit, 9mm handgun and holster. I would usually have a rifle of some variety with me as well. Other things I would have are a book for reading and my Every Day Carry (EDC) items like my smartphone, money and Advil.

It is a deficiency that there are a few items that are not contained within my bag at all times. I, perhaps foolishly, believe that there will always be time to add those bits from my EDC and or travel kit to the bag if need be. I don't plan on trying to ford any streams during a flood. I plan on fixing that over the next few months.

[Food](http://i.imgur.com/xR5FXga.jpg): 12 Mountain House entrees and 4 creakfasts.

[Energy](http://i.imgur.com/DPG5Hkh.jpg): Gum, 6 Hammer GEL, 8 PowerBar, sugar, tea bags, salt and pepper.

[Clothes](http://i.imgur.com/76bHQ4K.jpg): 3 pair of socks, 2 pair of underwear, 2 long sleeve shirts, 1 short sleeve shirt, poncho, pair of jeans and a warm hat.

[Fire](http://i.imgur.com/Z5oT7tO.jpg): 2 8oz isobutane/propane fuel canisters, stand, burner, cotton balls, waterproof matches, duct tape, fire sticks, more waterproof matches, lighter and striker based firestarter.

[Water](http://i.imgur.com/t3h4AVu.jpg): 23KN carabiner, water bottle, 10 water purification tablets, Katydn Hiker Pro water filter.

[Miscellaneous](http://i.imgur.com/SnZxi1N.jpg): Grundig radio, 8 AA batteries, 17 AAA batteries, headphones, shortwave antenna, belt carrier for my Petzl, Petzl Headlamp, belt carrier for my Leatherman, Leatherman Blast, Spyderco Delica, 2 small Gerber folding knives, rescue whistle, led light, compass, knife sharpener, fingernail clippers, utensils and 2 single edge razor blades (in the duct tape).

[Miscellaneous](http://i.imgur.com/wZOqZSo.jpg): 1.1L pot (acts as faraday cage for electronics), 4 tea lights, 4 anchors, bandana, 100' 550 cord and toilet paper.

[Hygene](http://i.imgur.com/oRrNhSn.jpg): 2 travel toothpaste, floss, 2 chapstick, Anbesol, Neosporin ointment, toothbrush, Q-tips, bug spray, hand sanitizer, vitamins, ear protection, antiseptic wipes, mouthwash and sunscreen.

[Other](http://i.imgur.com/Brf2Vhi.jpg): Zipties in three sizes, flashlight, notebook, rite in the rain notebook, 2 pens, 1 sharpie, 2 contractor grade garbage bags, mylar bivvy and a copy of the instructions for my Katadyn.

[Cutting](http://i.imgur.com/u6cvsAs.jpg): Hiking axe, Gerber LMF II with sheath.

[Backpack](http://i.imgur.com/M13k2P0.jpg): Kelty Redwing 3100 with a hydration pouch inside.

Things that I want to improve: a better hydration pouch, replace the jeans with tactical pants, and I would like to get a slightly larger bag with webbing on the outside to better facilitate strapping on add-ons for particular situations. I also plan on adding dedicated first aid. Yes, I probably have too many knives and perhaps too many ways to make fire. I have always preferred to be over-prepared.

The GHB weighs in at 28 pounds before filling the hydration pouch which is quite comfortable with how the backpack distributes the load. Yes, all of that really does fit within that bag. With extras it doesn't exceed 40 pounds in any configuration.

Why would any sane person who is working on actively building a SHTF kit to use in this scenario use a trash bag rather than purchasing real rain gear?  A condom for carrying water, get a &lt;insert expletive here&gt; two liter bottle from the trash it will last longer?  Seriously way to much of what I see tossed about here is at best what I would call bag lady survival.   (no offense to actual bag ladies)

If you want to build a get home bag try walking home in the summer on a nice day. (bring water)  Have a friend or spouse ready to come pick you up if you fail.  Use the experience of walking home to help see what you might need.  Winter or summer, storm or sunny the circumstances dictate different “kits”.  Why chance your survival to a trash bag or some other bag lady substitution.  Get a decent pair of trail runners, a good breathable rain jacket, and a fleece.  Build your kit around this and you can travel much farther and easier than a trash bag and condom will get you.

If you need a BOB then start with 50-60L pack not some 15L day pack.  Buy a decent three season tent with a full fly, a good sleeping bag and full pad.  Don't rely on sterno or butane for cooking.  Pack more than 3 days of food.  Pouched tuna, pasta/rice sides with a half gallon zip lock bag at the bare minimum are light and easy to prepare.  Get a decent pot to boil water in with a metal handle not plastic. Take a pair of heavy work gloves so you can fish the pot out of your fire after you drop it in.  If you want to test your BOB go on an overnight or weekend hike.  See what you used and what you didn't.  


A good quality non suspension bike is a great investment.  A small child bike trailer is also a good investment if you need to carry supplies for more than one person or for a longer journey.  Rear baskets or paniers are also an option.

Container gardening isn’t only for savvy urban gardeners and folks with limited space to grow, it can also be for folks who want to maximize their yields in a controlled environment. Not only does growing potatoes in a barrel reduce the amount of weeding and exposure to pests and fungi, you don’t even have to risk shovel-damage to the tender potatoes by digging them out of the ground when they’re done, just tip the container over!

After extensive research to plan his own potatoes-in-a-barrel, Tim from Greenupgrader.com boiled all of the recommendations down to 4 simple steps to a winning potato harvest.



1. Select and prepare a container
You’ll need to pick out a container such as a 50-gallon trash barrel or one of those half whiskey barrel planters. Alternatively, you can buy used food-grade barrels or commercially-available potato planters. Just about any 2 to 3-foot tall container will work, but be sure to select a container that either already has holes in it, or is okay to cut holes in. Next you’ll want to clean your container with a mild bleach solution to get out any of the nasties that have been lingering in there.

Good drainage is critical for the cultivation of healthy potatoes so you’ll want to cut or drill a series of large drainage holes in the bottom and bottom sides of your container. Alternatively, you can cut out the bottom altogether and place it on a well-drained surface like your garden bed.



2. Choose a variety and plant potatoes
Seed potatoes can usually be found at nurseries early in the growing season, but you should only have to buy them once. If you can, “chit” or sprout your potatoes before planting them by setting them out in an egg carton, the side with the most buds facing up, and putting them in a cool light room out of direct sunlight to sprout. Putting the tubers in an open paper bag can have this same effect.

Fill in the bottom of your container with about 6 inches of loose planting mix and compost. You’ll want to use a planting mix with a peat moss-like soil amendment like this product made from repurposed coconut husks, doing so will keep the soil from becoming too compacted and help it to store moisture for the roots. Next, add some seed potatoes on the layer of soil, making certain to leave plenty of space between each cube. You can use the whole potato but I like to cut the potatoes into 1 to 2-inch cubes for planting. Loosely backfill the potatoes with another 6 inches of your soil and compost mix and water to dampen soil. Keep the soil damp at all times but be careful not to overwater.



3. Add more soil
When they have about 6 to 8 inches of foliage, add another layer of your soil-compost mix covering about one-half to three-quarters of the visible stems and foliage. Repeat this process of allowing the sprouts to grow and then covering the sprouts and moistening the soil as the plants grow up toward the top of the barrel.


4. Harvest the potatoes
After about 10 weeks or until the plants flower and start to yellow, the potatoes should be ready to harvest. Carefully dig down with your hands to inspect the top-most layer. After you’ve confirmed your suspicions, dump the barrel out on a tarp and inspect your bounty.



Other tips to grow bushels of barrel potatoes
After the first harvest, keep a few potatoes to use as seed potatoes next year.
Bush beans are a great companion plant for potatoes.
Instead of using soil, try growing potatoes in sawdust.
Experiment with different containers, seed potatoes and watering regimes.
If the above steps aren’t sufficient, do some more research. Try here.

I tend not to use the term ""prepper"" because of the negative connotation that it has earned lately but I like to think that I'm prepared for the foreseeable disasters. I've chosen a home with enough land to grow food and raise small animals while also having direct access to much larger hunting grounds but also out of flood plains while still being on a major artery in my area which assures easy access and near constant electricity. I still like to think that I prepare for the worst though. Right now, I could easily survive for about three weeks without any electricity and without leaving my house. I have a generator with enough fuel on hand to run the furnace, lights, fridge, and the well pump to provide water. I'm also getting ready to store about three months of fresh water on hand in the basement and install solar and wind power on my property to diversify my electricity source. I don't keep nearly as much food on hand as I'm sure many of you do but I keep far more non-perishable items on hand than the normal person. 

So here is my case in point. We got SLAMMED by the blizzard this year but I didn't even bat an eyelash. I wasn't worried about power loss or my ability to leave my house for days at a time. I looked around and couldn't think of a single thing I needed to go to the store for that I didn't already have in abundance. I recall the ice storm and I'm currently prepared to survive that and more. 

Point being. who here is surviving for TEOTWAWKI and who is preparing for those instances that some of us seem to have to face once or twice a year lately? I love this subreddit because I really enjoy learning how to be self-sufficient but I'm not sure I think the world is coming to an end, I just don't want to rely on the government to turn my electricity back on or to fill my grocery store with food.

We just got back from OKC. 

In that post, I explained that I thought we would be able to provide meals just as good or way better than any of the food prepper companies out there. We just got a new, low sodium formula and I want to send a few packs out to people to get their feedback, and if it's positive, maybe launch this thing for real.

So, I would like to send a few of you one (1) meal pack. Here's the deal:

- You promise to give me your feedback. You can post here if you want, or just message me. I don't care if you say it sucks, I just want honest feedback.

- The pack will be sent in the packaging of our non-profit (I am personally covering the cost of it), so please do not divulge the name of the non-profit. There is technically nothing wrong with doing so, I just don't want to cross lines. 

- You should be a somewhat frequent poster in preppers or a similar subreddit.

I'll pick a few people (5 or so) from the people who post here asking to be a reviewer, I'll ship them out, and I'll happily await your feedback. 

There are pros to us and I'm sure cons as well, but I think on a calories/cost/flavor comparison, we will be able to hang with the big boys, and it will help fund a hunger relief charity. It's exciting.

If you want to be a reviewer, Post here and let me know, I will pick a few and let you know. 

Thanks!

**EDIT 1:20pm EST:** Thanks for the responses; I have responded to each person, and am going to cap it for now in terms of requests. If I asked you to send me your address, you're in. 

Here is a picture of one of the packs: http://i.imgur.com/1S2UHOo.jpg

You will see that these packs are a combination of: Rice, Dehydrated Soy, Dehydrated Vegetables, and a Vitamin/Seasoning powder. ***We didn't mean to do it, but it turns out that these are actually vegan.***

Anticipated pros: tastes good, inexpensive (**~$3.00 per 1,260 calories shipped/delivered**), portable, low sodium. 

Anticipated cons: lack of variety, needs boiling water (we serve these meals in places that have been devastated by disasters, and it has never been a problem...just start a fire and throw a pot on it).

***I will message everyone when I ship them out***

This was my first time using a common home-storage technique I learned about from this sub for long term food storage. My only deviation was instead of using one 2000cc O2 absorber (the recommended amount for 5 to 6 gallon buckets), I used two 1000cc absorbers with one buried at the bottom and one on top.

Up until this point, I've only been storing cans and ready to eat meals but decided to start storing more strict rations like rice, beans, and cornmeal. I'd possibly use these for our own food variety and as a little barter in a total collapse, but more likely for friends and family in a short term disaster.

I plan on filling a couple more buckets the weekend after next, just wanted to find out if anyone would recommend I do anything different next time. Thanks for any insights!

PS: I did this yesterday and will be opening the buckets after work to make sure the absorbers have removed the O2 and compressed the contents properly after work today. Will update later.

I like being prepared.  But I don't understand the prepper mentality.  Maybe I'm overthinking it.

Unless you have unlimited resources or a crystal ball, it's impossible to prepared for anything and everything that may occur.  So it makes sense to me that we should allocate our limited resources to preparing for risks according to their likelihood.

But I don't see preppers doing this at all.  I see preppers preparing for the extremely unlikely event of societal collapse, while often neglecting other more likely risks that aren't as fun to fantasize about as the zombie apocalypse.

To me, this is like someone who spends time and effort preparing to win the lottery.  They've already assembled their team of lawyers and CPAs, they've got the trusts or FLPs or whatever else set up, and they've mapped out exactly how they'll distribute the winnings among friends and family with minimal tax exposure.  They're determined not to be one of these chumps that blows through their windfall and winds up worse off than before they won.

Meanwhile their day to day financial situation is a mess, and they never win the lottery anyway.

My dad is a prepper.  His pickup truck is outfitted to withstand an EMP and he maintains an extensive aquaponic system in his garage.  But he doesn't have a fire extinguisher, a carbon monoxide detector, or an automated external defibrillator in his house, and he does not carry disability insurance—let alone critical illness, organ transplant, or any of the other lines of coverage available.  All of these seem like things that someone who is committed to preparedness would prioritize above preparing for a nuclear winter or some such.

I've been watching ""preppers"" on National Geographic and I saw that a lot of the preppers have a tremendous collection of guns and some are training children to use them. I'm not from the US so we don't really have a 'gun-culture'.
So my question is, do you really think you will need guns when the time comes? And do you really think people will come to your house armed, wanting to take your stuff?
As far as I know, the US is the only country that allows guns to be bought as easily as they are.

We anchored, I started eating, and I asked him to show me what was in his kit. One of the things he pulled out was some beef jerky with an expiration date in 1987. He ate it with a smile.

He had a pocket kit that was much more basic, but this was his big luxury kit (about 12""X12""X5"") if he had time to grab it in a disaster. If anyone's interested, here's what he had:

Spool of fishing line

12 feet of parachute cord (12 strands in the cord, so 144 feet of string)

Small knife

Pump flashlight

Compass

GPS

Fishing hooks (mostly because they don't take up space and could have a lot of uses)

Space blanket (for warmth and signaling)

Garbage bags

Signal mirror

Flint and magnesium

Steel wool

A handful of fire starter sticks

Lighters

Signal tape

Small stove that can run off fuel or diesel.

Tea bags (he said the first thing you need to do while you're sitting on the shore watching your plane sink into the water is make some tea and take a deep breath)

Water filter and tablets

Marine radio with spare batteries

26 year old jerky

**He also had an awesome homemade ham radio made out of an Altoids can.** He has a homemade key he uses to transmit morse code through a friggin' Altoids can!

Water/windproof matches (they're not as useful as a few lighters, but they make good kindling)

A foot of Heavy duty aluminum foil crumpled up

Whistle

Bear ""mace"" (I put that in quotes because it's smaller than normal bear mace, doesn't actually say ""bear mace"" anywhere on the canister, and is illegal in Canada)

Flare gun with a strip of 8 flares (one of which we shot off into the water, 1998 expiration date)

Two parachute flares

Gauze in a zip loc

Small roll of duck tape he sawed down to a third of the original width

**A badass radio antenna launcher he made out of a slingshot and fishing reel.** He has a sinker on the end of the line, uses the slingshot to shoot the line over the highest branch of a spruce, and he uses that to pull up the antenna.

When he was going into the bush he'd pour rice in the kit to fill the empty spaces, but he doesn't do that anymore, to keep things neat.

His pocket kit included the basics, but it was also his pot for boiling water, and it had a rubber cup inside.

We can create meals where a single serving (everyone uses 1 cup as a serving size it seems) for less than 50 cents, maybe even the low 40 cent range. 

These are the typical bags of food that may have rice or beans as a base and then added proteins, vegetables and vitamins. 

One of the downfalls is that there is not a whole lot of variety and these are the type of meals that would require boiling water to make. 

I really wouldn't know how to go about doing this, all I know is we are packaging meals and sending them all over the place for disaster relief and according to my calculations, we can do it a lot cheaper than these other guys. 

Anyone have any thoughts on steering me in the right direction?

**EDIT:** Did some calculations  (quick ones, can't guarantee this as a price and might even be able to get it down from this) since the amount of food seems to be a thing that a lot of the companies play around with in terms of what a serving size is, but you'd be looking at about $2 per 2,000 calories. *Maybe* a little less like $1.90 per 2,000 calories.",,False,self,t5_2riow,1356107282.0,,,True,t3_15879f,http://www.reddit.com/r/preppers/comments/15879f/just_had_a_possible_epiphany_i_work_for_a/,

What kind of food could I store that wouldn't require any sort of cooking to be edible but still palatable?

I know I could eat soup or beans out of the can, but let's assume that's not an optimal taste experience. Bread and deli-style meat don't keep long term, so sandwiches are out. I'd rather not have to buy a propane camp grill or scrounge up a mini-stove out of alcohol and old soda cans.

I think somewhere between doing nothing (where I am today), and buying a farm and digging a bunker, there lies realistic or practical prepping.

For instance, I live in rural Massachusetts but work about an hours drive away.

I don't have the skill to live off the land or hunt for food, nor do I honestly think that the US or the world is really that close to being thrown back into the barbaric days of yore.

However, there are very practical, every day reasons to be more aware and knowledgeable about what to do in the event of storms, ""attacks"", police actions, what have you...things that I think are probable that might alter my day to day life.

I have a house, a truck and a generator.  We have a normal amount of food in the house for weekly living, but no long term food storage.  I don't have (or want?) a firearm.  I know several ways to drive home from work.  We know our neighbors and have family in the area we could stay with in case our house is at the epicenter of this ""event"".

So I guess my question is, does anyone have advise on a comfortable level of preparedness for non-preppers? 

What advise would you give friends or family with regards to ""getting ready"" before needing to be ready?

I realized quite early on during the financial crisis that things had somehow changed but this time I feel like I might be late.

Anything that I might cite seems more like conspiracy theories than something I should be concerned about. It's like the world has almost changed into a cartoon. In response to this feeling I have seriously ramped up my preparations over the past few months. I have done a few things that just make me feel a little crazy like canceling subscriptions and downgrading services so I would have the money to spend elsewhere.

We do however have a fair number of people, who are trying to promote their own websites, that are submitting content. Many of them also have web-stores.

I don't have any problems with people supporting themselves but I think we need to revisit the idea of blog-spam and make it clearer and more obvious what our rules are. Unfortunately not everyone who is trying to make a go of it has the time or interest to participate in reddit the way that reddiquette suggests is proper. Reddit is a terrible way to get a blog off of the ground unless you win the lottery and go viral.

I am looking for suggestions as to how to manage the problem and have a proposal for consideration:

---

Owners of web-stores which have blogs or post articles of some kind can post once per week linking their own content if they give the /r/preppers community a dedicated discount code for their site. The submitted links must be to a to an article which would be of general interest to the community.

If a submitter does not have a web-store they are permitted to submit one article per week to their own content.

If either of those classes of submitter breaks the rules and it is verified they will receive one warning. A second violation will result in being banned from /r/preppers.

---

The rules will be linked in the side-bar to a wiki article containing the rules. If this change is approved everyone will start off from a clean slate.

Of course, if the community does not like the content all of the standard voting policies are still in place. People should always feel free to reject content that they don't feel is appropriate.

Your input on this matter would be greatly appreciated.

Currently that is turned off for /r/preppers. Since we seem to be gaining more and more readers every day it would seem like a good idea to turn on the wiki so we can cover some of the basic questions which seem to be coming up regularly.

My thoughts are to turn it on only for editing by the moderators but for the community to write the articles which appear. I think we could start with articles about basic water, food, shelter and security and branch out from there. If someone wants to take a crack at writing them make a self-post and get the communities feedback. If the community approves then I will move it into the wiki. Until we have our first approved article, I will leave the wiki off since it is empty.

Just as a quick note of introduction, webdoodle asked me to be a moderator last week. I have been actively prepping since 2007 and still have a ways to go. I am more than happy to share lessons learned and what I know with the community.

More details inside the post...",20,2,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/preppers/comments/13jg1j/rpreppers_i_need_help_coming_to_a_compromise_with/,"*First and foremost, apologies for the wall of text! I just felt the background information was necessary to explain that I am open-minded but new to this.*

I want to start by saying I just found this subreddit and I hope this kind of post isn't out of line. I just spent the better part of an hour reading a bunch of interesting links submitted recently and they have actually been quite enlightening for an hours' time, so I hope this isn't perceived as clutter amid a bunch of helpful articles. It's just that I've been at a loss as to how to handle this situation and when I found this sub I felt relieved because there's probably no better community than one made up of fellow Redditors to provide me with some insight.

Now, here's the predicament: I married the love of my life 3 months ago. I've always poked fun at him for reading into zombie apocalypse movies, Call of Duty, etc. too much. I honestly always felt his desire to stock up on weaponry, ammo, etc. was a little overboard, since I assumed his only motivation for doing so came from zombie-related media. Recently, though, I've realized that he just has that natural propensity to be a ""prepper."" Once we were engaged, he started making comments that showed me his prepper desires actually ran deeper than I thought -- ""We should pack up our backpacking equipment that could help us in an emergency so we can efficiently grab it and go, if need be,"" ""After we move we should start keeping extra non-perishable food on hand just in case,"" stuff like that. Now that I understand him better, I feel it would be smart to oblige his wishes and get on board with (even basic, to start) preparation. I guess now I just see the benefit of being better prepared for an emergency and of satiating his desire to be prepared. My hang up is that I don't have the same innate urge at this point because it doesn't seem overly practical in our current situation. We live in a small one-bedroom rental that we won't be staying in much longer (8 months max). We're considering moving to a larger urban area to (hopefully) help ourselves out in terms of career advancement since we've been very limited because of where we live. Also, our discretionary income is pretty paltry right now.

My main concern is that I don't know where to start since we won't be staying in our house (which, for the record, is extremely lacking in the storage department) for long and we'll likely move to a city when our lease ends. I suppose it just seems to me like it would be more effective to wait until we have a home of our own, although I fully understand waiting for a future date defeats the purpose of preparing for an emergency that could happen any time. So my question for you all is (also serves as a **TL;DR**): **for someone very new to the idea of prepping who is interested in learning more about how to get started, what would be the best course of action for me and my husband, who I've recently discovered is a prepper at heart, in our current circumstances?**",,False,self,t5_2riow,False,,,True,t3_13jg1j,http://www.reddit.com/r/preppers/comments/13jg1j/rpreppers_i_need_help_coming_to_a_compromise_with/,

1.) What is most important to you when buying preps online?  Do you buy preps online?

2.) What things do you look for in a store before you are comfortable giving them your hard earned money?  Are there any deal breakers that immediately turn you away?

I'm not, contrary to what some people think, preparing for the end of the world. For me, prepping is just common sense. 

I live in an area (Illinois) that's prone to tornadoes, winter storms and possibly earthquakes (if New Madrid ever goes) and I think there's a possibility that I could slide in to a ditch in my car in the winter, or that a tornado or ice storm could knock out power for several days or several weeks. I have food, water, an ability to cook food without power and ways to stay warm too. I have cash and savings for a a potential financial emergency such as a job loss or major unplanned expense. Those things, to me at least, are much more likely than martial law and actually possible to hedge against. 

I do not think that myself, my girlfriend and my 60-something parents are going to be taking on the US military. I do not think that the N Koreans will invade. I do own firearms, and I have the ability to defend my house if necessary from someone looking for some free stuff in a bad situation. 

Sorry for the small rant, I'm just sort of amazed at what I've read at times on other forums about people planning on living in their bunkers and waging guerrilla warfare against the Army.

I have been wanting to start prepping for a while now,however there are many things that stand in the way.

For starters...im poor...I make barely enough to survive off of as it is...let alone buying supplies to store for use when shtf!

My own family...they seem to think prepping is silly...they think im too young to understand...they still wont listen when I point out everything wrong with the world and seem to think its just peachy and theres no way that a disaster of large scale sould occur at any moment (gas attacka/dirty bomb/ 9/11 repeat/nuclear incident/freak natural disasters) however I have been aware if many things and have even known about this stuff for a long time...(im 19 btw)


Also I cannot set up a Bugout Loc :/ though Ideally I would mostlikely hike out into the woods away from a crippled society and begin a search for an abandoned structure for shelter 

As of late i have been observing people around me...within the past 6 months they have changed...they all used to be relaxed, and somewhat happy...anymore I see everyone seemingly on alert, and many people are anxious and nervous for various reasons...which makes me uncomfortable around them...amd has set off the alarm in my head that says something bad is going to happen relatively soon...be it somethig to prep for...or as the state of the US gov...to fight for..

So...guys...girls...and whatever is in between...Is there a way around these two issues that can allow me to start prepping without alerting anyone else that im being sneaky and storing supplies?",,False,self,t5_2riow,False,,,True,t3_18t0tg,http://www.reddit.com/r/preppers/comments/18t0tg/i_would_like_to_begin_prepping_but_i_have_a_few/,

Every couple of months my friends and I get together and do a mock bug out, where we camp in the woods at my friends farm for a night or two. I always designate a scenario as to why we need to bug out, to help us get into it, and I love to design ""missions"" that we must do that force us to test our skills and gear. And I always make a reward if we succeed, a penalty if we fail, or a combination of the two. A few examples include:

Simulated injury: Correct first aid-Patient recovers quickly, Failure-Patient cannot help with physical labor, such as gathering wood for 4 hours.

Lost food: We have to find enough food to feed 1 person a decent meal. Success- I brought snacks in my bug out bag, and everyone gets some tasty treats.

Scouting for supplies: Success- Get to use my friend's ATV to move our gear some.

Orienteering: Must find a cache that is hidden in the woods at given coordinates. Success: Extra water bottles.

Just to name a few.

My thing is that I am running out of ideas for missions, and I need your help! Please help me think of mission ideas and rewards we can use to test ourselves. Firearms are basically out of the equation. My friend's farm has cattle, and firearms could make them stampede. (OFC, we carry some firearms for protection, just in case coyotes get to close)

With that in mind, and the recent string of events, I asked a military wife what her husband (SpecOps) thought about this recent disclosure about the NSA. Long story short she said he was not surprised at all. Even if the story as portrayed isn't entirely accurate, it is not outside the realm of possibility based on what he has seen and participated in. Further, I was rather shocked to find, he and many others in his unit also have bug out bags. Seems that it is a common thing within his unit to have a bug out bag or other preparations in expectation of some failure of societal or governmental normality. That quite surprised me as he seemed to be the prototypical successful military man with the wife and kids.

1355536847.0,14,self.preppers,14vicb,My plan,18,4,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/preppers/comments/14vicb/my_plan/,"(this might belong in prepperscircle_jerk but I wanted to talk this out if you'll hear me.  I've also gotten some answers via http://www.reddit.com/r/preppers/comments/14kdrn/realistic_prepping_information/ already.)

I've been hovering for a while, gathering info but it really can be overwhelming.

Between /r/preppers, /r/survival/ and /r/bugout, I have a lot of work ahead of me.

But I have to start somewhere, and I've decided the most practical prepping/survival situation I need to prep for is hunkering down in my house due to extreme weather conditions, which have effected me before:  we were out of power for 6 days but we only made it 2 before we had to leave home.

So my plan is to make my house livable without power for at least 1 week without needing to leave for supplies.

It is just my wife and I, so we don't have to account for a lot of people.

We have a house (in central Massachusetts) with a pellet stove, an 8000w gas generator, and an oil burning furnace (hot water and some base board heating).

As far as the house goes:

Setup the generator to power the house.  Right now I have to run extension cords and can't run the furnace off it.

Insure a supply of pellets &amp; make sure the oil is at least 1/2 full at all times.   

Keep (and rotate) gasoline, though I don't think I can store enough for an entire week.

Prepare enough material to board up the house due to hurricanes/tornadoes, which we have been victims of recently.

Test the backup sump pump.   If the primary fails, the basement will flood quickly, depending on rain fall, etc.

Equipment:

Secondary cooking source since I don't want to rely on the electric stove as it would draw so much power.

I would guess a camping stove with bottled fuel makes the most sense, but perhaps a fire pit could be used as well.

Again, this isn't a SHTF situation, so a discussion about firearms isn't necessary.

Light sources:  flashlights and lanterns.  I'll avoid candles as a fire hazard.

Fire extinguisher.

Tarps.

Shovels, salt/sand.

(Chain) saw as we do have trees that might come down that can be a hazard.

As this is home, clothes, shoes, jackets, etc shouldn't be an issue.  Neither is entertainment.

Food/water:

Store bottled water for 2 people for a week.  Additionally, device a water collection system for rain run off or snow melting.  Provide a way to filter/purify collected water.

Store enough food for 2 people.  Make this part of our normal consumption to keep stocks as fresh as possible.

Account for a means of personal hygiene.   I'm not terribly sure what this is yet....baby wipes?  Perhaps a ""camping shower""?  We do have a tub, but I wouldn't waste stored water on that.

I am also planning on basic first aid/CPR classes and other ""survival"" courses to help get me ready for camping/fire starting/cooking, etc.

Does this sound reasonable?  Am I overlooking any significant areas?  Anything else I should be working on?

Thanks preppers!

I realize that this show may be reaching a very specific demographic and providing us a way to learn from each other as well as fine tune our own strategies based on what others have done and the expert evaluations provided. But, it still seems to me that exposing yourself like that can be risky, especially if non-preppers watch this show and realize that someone on the show may live in their area. This may create unneeded risk for those preppers. Let’s face it, even without a disaster or other collapse, we store and maintain very expensive caches of supplies, equipment, and weapons.

Just wondering if anyone else out there feels the same way I do.

1. Always keep at least a half tank of gas in your vehicles. (I know this costs money but you have to refill your tank eventually) Just make the 1/2 line the new E line.
2. Keep up with your dishes and laundry at home. If you're bugging in and need to conserve water you don't want to waste it doing these menial chores.

Thinking of a small MRE kit too and water, although I do live where it will freeze in the winter, so I'm wondering how I should handle that.

Already in the car is flashlight, air compressor, jumper cables, football, ball cap, and suntan lotion.  

I also carry a 2.5"" folding serrated blade as part of my EDC.

What do you all carry in your car and please add any suggestions you may have for me.

**edit**

The reason I'm prepping my car is you never know where you'll be when SHTF, plus I'd like being prepared for whatever life throws at me.  I'm not always at home, but I always have my car near me.  I'm not really looking at this as a bug out situation.  I agree with all the comments here, I'd much rather bug in if at all possible.

If I did have to bug out, I'd load up my car with all the bug in supplies I could carry and go from there, but heck having some basics in the car doesn't hurt as it would save time and gives me even more supplies.

Thanks for the replies so far, I'm seeing some good suggestions to add to my trunk stash.

1332211027.0,14,self.preppers,r4hi7,"Does anyone else thing that ""preppers"" as shown on television are kind of not the way we'd like to see things work out?",17,3,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/preppers/comments/r4hi7/does_anyone_else_thing_that_preppers_as_shown_on/,"It seems like as far as prepping goes, most folks that get a TV show are pretty hardcore about a SHTF scenario, but it's sort of depressing.  It's basically a focus on the most hardcore realists and pessimists, who will invest a lot of time and money and resources to get selfish and defend their stuff to the death and assume they have to if they encountered me.

It seems like in a SHTF scenario, they watched too much of *the Road* or *Book of Eli* stuff.  It seems like they've already made the assumption that everyone else is the enemy.

It doesn't seem like a solid way to go for a number of reasons.  These folks are loners, and preparing to be loners for the long haul.  A decent strategy for a short while, but it has some faults:

1.  No matter how long you hole-up, you're gonna eventually run out of resources.  You're gonna eventually have to crawl out of your hole and deal with survivors.  If you assume I'm dangerous, you're gonna act in a way that *I* will assume *you* are.  This really isn't very conductive to rebuilding any sort of society.  If we're all mistrustful of one another, how can we work together for any extended period of time?

2.  Maybe the show doesn't show it, but it seems like they didn't invest much in outdoor survival.  It seems like if you have $500,000 dollars to spend on a shelter and food for a long ride-out, and you made great efforts to hide from others where your bug-out base is; you have that much money and time to invest in survival skills that you learned from others, and you met others learning as well.  All people and contacts that might be useful when a SHTF scenario occurs.

3.  I honestly think when the SHTF scenario happens, we'll all be better off rebuilding smaller societies where everyone gets along, and we need each other for the skills and usefulness we bring to the table.  Our ancestors might have started out with a solitary background but found out that community makes the species work.  After a SHTF scenario, a lot of us are gonna die.  Those that survive *have* to find a group.  And these groups are going to have to figure out how to work together.  Imagine if after 6 months, or a year or two, some guy just walks into you camp.  You ask, ""where did you come from.""  They tell you they've been eating franks and beans for the last year while you and your group struggled.  You're not really a guy I want in my group.  We've all been living off the land and helping each other as best we could, and you've been in some post-apocalypse Taj-Mahal worrying about where to store you feces and refuse.

Granted I'm an Montanan and I don't make a lot of money for a SHTF shelter...  But I *am* a Montanan.  I know a bit about harsh elements, and a bit about hunting and trapping, and a bit about what it takes to survive in a place like this, and a bit about where I should bug-out too.  But being a Montanan means that there's going to be a lot of places to go and restart, and we can do it; we've done it before under hostile condidtions (be it the elements or enemies).  But you're never an expert at anything, you always have a lot to learn, and there's always someone better that can teach you.  And if you're gonna survive, you need them.

And I know a miniscule bit about survival, and *ABSOLUTELY* nothing about prepping to go it alone.  But I gotta say...  when I watch ""prepper shows"", I guess I get their pessimism about human nature, and I can appreciate their realism...  but the realism is flawed, because it's a black/white issue for them, and there is no such thing as a black/white issue.

At home, we done some prepping stuff...  bulk up on long-term survival foods.  Tear up the back yard as a garden and learn to can, build a rabbit hitch and a pigeon loft for meat.  But it's fucked up in the long run because I think with the help of others, in a SHTF scenario, I really don't want to defend it.  We can go make the same thing elsewhere together.

The garden and the rabbits and the pigeons and such would be a decent short-term way to ""Bug-*in*, but I certainly wouldn't put my family at stake to defend it, when I have contacts that can help bug-out and we can restart it and learn even more from each other.

So I'm bummed that the ""prepper"" outfit seems to act (at least on television) like I'm your enemy, and you have to kill me because I'm gonna take from you, or that I would take from you for some reason.  It sucks because, as little as I know about ""prepping"", you have to assume that everyone is the enemy, and we're not and we're not because it's a shit long-term plan for rebuilding.

I know a bit about survival, and nothing about ""prepping"" beside this new fad that's catching on on television.

This site was really made with preppers in mind.  


A little bit about how this started and the concept behind the site. It really is a merging of several interests for me, web design (this was my first big project), I wanted to start a business, and my long interest in prepping, particularly self sufficiency and security being my big ones. So I got the idea in my head one day and just decided to go for it.   


When you visit the site, you'll notice there are a wide range of products. My hope is to be a little different than the other prepper sites out there, and post products that are either unique, bizarre, practical or fun, and really get people's imagination running and get them talking. Also, I feel that prepping should be for everyone. Regardless of who you are, where you live, how much you earn and so on, there is something you could be doing to be better prepared for the worst.  


A little about my interest in prepping- as you can tell, I think there are a lot of different perspectives people might have on this, my personal one is self sufficiency because when (not if) the grid goes down, even for a couple days, you will be a lot happier if you have what you need than if you don't.  And also, I find security really interesting too. How can you make your house/car more secure against break ins, protect yourself when you're going for a walk , and so on. Living in a big city, I've heard and seen a lot of crazy things happen to people. 


PS. If you're interested, I'm giving away a free Army Survival Guide right now if you sign up for our [newsletter](http://howiprep.us7.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=389f5bc91cc024a67d421ca98&amp;id=960a8db020) you're not obligated to stay subscribed , I just don't know a better way to track the requests for it.

.30 Ammo Can

Cardboard box

One ziplock back per item used

One EMP Cover Bag 18""x22"" in size

Total cost was $16 for the ammo can, and $24 for two of those EMP bags.  The ziplock bags I took from my cupboard (she never noticed).  The cardboard box I got when I purchased some magazines.  Total $40.

So, I first wrapped each of the items that I wanted to save for the Apocalypse (One solar charger for cell phones, one Android powered HTC EVO, and a hand cranked and solar powered radio) in ziplock bags.    I then placed all three things in one of the EMP bags and wrapped them up with a roll of the EMP bag.  Put them in the cardboard box, and then sealed up the ammo can.  Done.

How do I know this will work?  Before I started on the can, I turned on the hand crank radio, and turned it to a station.  I put the radio in the EMP bag and closed it (not sealed it, just closed it) and the radio station turned to static.

As I decided not to include it I'll donate it to the /r/prepper community.

The proliferation of social media and image hosting sites is both a boon and a curse to preppers.

Boon as it allows easy contact, and dialog among those in the prepping community.  A curse as it often leaves those same preppers vulnerable to identification by those wishing or planning to do harm.  A simple picture posted of your ""preps"" taken with a smart phone often lead to revealing where those preps are actually stored.

With off line tools like jpeg-snoop and browser plugins like Jeffrey Friedl's Exif viewer it has become trivial to extract and view the information embedded by default in most smartphone images.  Armed with this information a simple Google maps query can reveal not only the location but also provide images of the location in question.  That picture you took of your preps in your retreat, it was smart claiming it was in Tennessee but the EXIF data shows it's in Vermont.  Would you like the coordinates and driving directions?  Did you just post on Facebook that you were going to the Bahamas with your family?  Now I know you will not be there, perhaps I should go see what I can obtain from you.  Perhaps my survival strategy is to trade info on where your preps are to the local motorcycle gang in return for a share of the spoils.  

Aha, I see you registered that domain for your new blog to prove to everyone why your freeze dried is better than their dehydrated food for long term storage?  You forget to include a good privacy option in your WHOIS data.  Oh, look that's your name, phone number and address hmm should I copy that down.

Wow, just look at how many people registered for that chance to win a non-existent case of freeze dried food on my blog.  Lets search popular websites for the username your email address used.  Now I can correlate your real name and address with the things you post about online.  Even though you sanitized your pictures you still posted enough information for me to find that stash of preps in your garage that you bragged about on Facebook.

How can you avoid these issues.  For pictures either disable location information on your smartphone or save them to your computer first then open them in mspaint and save them as a new picture.  This will remove all EXIF data including location information.

If registering a domain always pay that small extra for the privacy option.

If you register for a contest related to any website use a generic email from a web mail provider like yahoo, hotmail or google also  use a different username on every site you register for.  It could be as simple as adding different numbers before or after your usual name. i.e. 98prepper07

He is super smart and I feel he could be very useful in a bad situation. Obedience training was a breeze for him but we are working on refining those skills and making them stronger. My husband and I also play a game with him where we take him out back and one of us hides in the house or somewhere on the farm and we make him go find the person. (We go hiking a camping out in the middle of nowhere a lot so this will be useful if we get separated.) The next dove season, we are going to train him to retrieve the birds for us. I would really like to teach him to help hunt for us but I'm not sure how to do that. I would also like to teach him to go find the other person if one of us becomes unresponsive and we are separated but again I'm not sure how to do that either.

I was talking to another prepper the other day and he told me that his dog would be left behind, that there was no use in bringing the ""family pet"" as it would be an extra mouth to feed and would take extra time in a bug out situation. I tried to explain that if he prepared for his dog right along with preparing for his family and trained the dog to obey his commands that the dog would be very useful in that kind of situation, but he just wouldn't hear of it.

To that end, I am starting my research into ""prepping"" and gathering knowledge and equipment.

I have plans for ""training"":  CPR/first aid classes, fire arms class and license, even learning how to drive a motorcycle.  Things I've always wanted to do anyway, plus they apply to this plan.

For equipment, I have an idea of what I would need but trying to be cost aware at the same time.

My first plan is to build a ""get home bag"", since with my current knowledge, hunkering down at home is my best bet.

Finally to my questions:

Is it possible to mix an EDC pack with a ""get home bag"" that would function as a bug out bag in the most dyer situation?

I see a lot of equipment needs overlapping and since I wont really be heading into the woods to live off the land, it seems I can solve all 3 functions with one setup, but if getting home isn't an option I'd need some level of full blown gear.

Any input or bag suggestions are welcome.

1354205980.0,11,self.preppers,13zypx,Hi r/preppers!  I'm trying to better understand prepping and why people do it. Would any of you be interested in answering a survey about what you do?,18,7,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/preppers/comments/13zypx/hi_rpreppers_im_trying_to_better_understand/,"http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/TCLPZ2D is the survey.

I have tried to contact a few of you by pm but haven't got much responses, so I thought I'd just try it here in the forum.  

The reason I'm asking these questions is for an article I'm writing about the Mayans and 2012 beliefs.  In this, I would like to contrast these people with strange beliefs to people who more rationally think about the potential end of times.  You all are obviously the more rational, yet you are also misunderstood by most other people.  

The article isn't for any publication, I am an amateur writer and will just post it on a blog.  [This](http://itisntdangerous.blogspot.com) is my blog if you're interested in seeing what kinds of things they write.  It's just about my life as an American living in Mexico.

I hope this isn't too assuming or intrusive in posting this here.  I am very interested in your culture and would really love to learn more about it.

Finally, if you prefer to just answer the questions here on reddit and not go to the survey, no problem!  Here they are:

1. What do you do, how old are you and where do you live?

2. How long have you been prepping for?

3. Why did you start prepping?

4. How exactly do you prep, i.e. how much food, water, etc. do you store away and what additional trainings or education have you sought?

5. Is there any specific calamity that you are prepping for?

6. Have you seen the show ""Doomsday Preppers"" on NatGeo? Do you feel that it is a fair presentation of preppers?

7. In my research into this, I've read about some people who seem quite extreme in their preparations. For example one guy said he has stored away enough food for 22 people for 15 years. It seems his prepping was almost a fetish in that he actually wanted something bad to happen so that he could actually live in that situation. Do you think that some preppers actually want a catastrophe to happen so that their efforts are not in vein?

8. Is there anything you would find appealing about living in a post-apocalyptic world?

9. Do you feel that you're missing out on other things in life by spending so much time prepping?

10. What do you think about zombie and other post apocalypse movies? Any favorites? Any that you absolutely hate?

Thanks!

EDIT:  Thanks to everyone who participated!  As one person suggested, yes I will later post the results.  It will take me a little while, but I promise to do it and also to post the eventual article I am writing.

I must say, I had much different impression of prepping before I read your responses.  Shows like Doomsday Preppers wrongly shaped my opinion of everything, and I see that most of you are more rational and sensible and preparing for things that are actually likely to occur.  You have actually inspired me to start prepping in some small ways because I mean, why not?  It seems like having the ability to be self-sufficient is a good thing and smart thing to do.

I should add to that I'm not necessarily looking to keep the home nice and toasty.   In the event that I do need to use my backup option, my main goal would be insuring pipes don't freeze.

I was (am) an eagle scout. I hike and camp and love the outdoors. I plan my five year, one year, monthly and weekly budgets, I save money for retirement and for emergencies. I write as well. A minor character in a story I'm writing seemed to take the forefront and I've been running with it. I can't quite get the mentality of 'doomsday' people down. This is where I need some help. I'm asking these questions because while I have a base for this character he was originally written from a perspective that he is insane. (don't take offence) Since I am assuming that you are not indeed insane I am looking for other motives / reactions to situations.

`The questions may come off as aggressive or sound like their intent is to wind you up. That is not why I'm asking. I prefer to be blunt though. This is the internet and I think you can handle it.`

* What would your response be if someone lumped your mentality or world views with other fringe groups like the Westburo Baptist church, or practicing cannibals? Or people who believe in alien abductions or ghosts? (meaning at most people (possible the reader them self) do not believe in ghosts or aliens or that eating people is correct or that god kills military personal because two dudes do it. Likewise most people for whatever reasons don't fall into the prepper mentality and others tend to lump all fring groups as weird or crazy or quaint.)

* How important is the guns issue? i.e. could someone with no guns etc be considered a prepper (from other preppers perspective.) That is say a hippy commune where all the food is local grown and sourced etc etc.

* How would you personally respond if for some reason you had to take a mental health exam or met with a mental health professional and afterward they told you (accused you) of wanting a disaster to happen so that you could be an important person?

* Do you secretly wish the above would happen?

* How do you look at 'normal' people. This includes those living paycheck to paycheck as well as those who have emergency funds and retirement funds, but no bunkers, or escape plans, or months of food, or clean water.

* Do you ever watch shows / read / or meet people who make you cringe and say: ""They give all preppers a bad name."" Does this happen far more often than not? (meaning that you personally don't agree with most other preppers) The point of this questions is to get a feel of the prepper community. i.e. are they fairly like minded or just a group of people with highly different goals / attitudes.

* Do you own guns? Do you know the ""weak points"" at local shops / grocery stores / gas stations / etc so if you had to steal or attack the building you could.

* Do you consider yourself Christian? If so what is your stance on those that come looking for food after whatever your planning for happens?

* How do you feel when someone attacks your beliefs with laughter and total disregard. That is like an asshole adult might handle a child that tells them Santa is real or a biologist might deal with a parent who honestly does not understand evolution.

* Lastly how much time do you spend doing prep stuff that other people don't. So everyone does dishes or takes out trash. If you were to do this differently than others, say bleach your dishes when most don't or say separate your trash into compost-able and other, count that time.

I imagine collapse and postcollapse on islands such as Crete, Cyprus, Ireland etc. would play out slightly differently from mainland crises, but I can't quite predict how. Similarly, the fact that mainland Europe has less wilderness than NA would surely effect a prepping plan.

I've been slowly prepping for WROL for about 6 months now. Not much money but doing the best I can, mostly focused on food and survival gear.

Recently I finally purchased my first weapon for home defense, a .40 S&amp;W handgun. I've never owned a gun before and I am trying to learn quickly.

In a WROL prepping situation, is stocking up on Hollow Points really worth it? I mean, I've seen Youtube videos about the tremendous damage they can do. Without question they have much better stopping power. But for someone on a budget and trying to stock up, is it really worth paying more than 2x the price of a FMJ round? My gut instinct is that having a larger stockpile would be better in the long run.

Any thoughts?

I also take an interest in fitness, nutrition and health and I train/exercise regularly.
One thing that I feel is overlooked is good sources of essential proteins and fats in a bug out situation.
Vitamins and minerals are also critical for human health and basic functioning. Fortunately these are easy to stock up on in pill form but I often feel that these are overlooked since I never see any mentions of them on here.

If we're talking a long term shtf scenario then I know we could hunt small game for meat with a decent air rifle but that's not likely to fit in a BoB.
If you're forced to evacuate for whatever reason, will you just resort to fishing or do you have other ways to catch land animals. 

So, what do you guys think? How will you get you're nutrients in a survival situation?


Edit: what if you're bugging in? How do you store long term protein and fat supplies? Whey protein powder is pretty good and the shelf life is about a year I think. And I think olive oil can last indefinitely if it's kept in good conditions. Hunting is always an option. Any other ideas?

I decided to read up on the subject after two major natural disasters: I was living in a midwestern city during a tornado, and then my husband was stranded in NYC during Sandy. 

One thing that I noticed is that every bug-out bag list includes a roll of paper towels. I would much rather have a packet of strong diaper wipes, like [Costco's](http://www.costco.com/Kirkland-Signature™-Baby-Wipes.product.11489346.html). Not to get too graphic, but just one handles most toilet needs. They can be used for a sponge bath if you can't shower. They can be used for other clean-up situations where a moist paper towel would be helpful. I would much rather have a pack of these than a roll of toilet paper in pretty much any situation. 

The only drawback I can think of is that they're definitely heavier than toilet paper, but I suspect you'd get more wipes out of a pack of these than one roll of paper, so they're probably a better use of pack space.

However, after doing the math I have found that there are some dehydrated kits labeled as 1080 servings for 1 adult for 1 year. Seems almost right in that I will need 3 meals a day for 365 days which equals 1095 servings for the year. Except, each serving is 200 to 300 calories. 

I have found some dehydrated vegetables, grains, fruits, and meats that sell for much cheaper and much more calorie content. My only question is, where can I buy this locally. I have been hearing horror stories of sites running out of stock and purchases are in limbo.

- distance from fault lines
- constant room temp
- precip/climate to promote limited agriculture
- distance from potential hazards (known fault lines, reactors, mil storage facilities, urban populations)

I've researched Montana vehicle modification laws, and the only thing I've found is there are certain core safety parts that need to be installed and operating correctly. This includes breaks, windshield wipers, decent tires and what not. Can anyone help me clarify what I can and cannot do from a legal stand point? The technicalities of what I can get away with?

This required me to make my first purchase online for my prepping goods.

My understanding is that USA Emergency Supply just contracts with other distributors and don't actually make or store the goods themselves. They are sort of an intermediary of sorts. I read on blogs that this meant their prices were higher, but from searching around, it seemed like one of the lower prices.

I purchased 10 - 20x30"", 5mil thick bags for $12.70 and 20 - 1000cc 02 absorbers for $9.47. For some reason 20 of the 1K is cheaper than 10 2K so I figured I would double up the 1K for each bag (is this an ok thing to do?).

My only complaint is that the FedEx shipping number they gave me didn't work on the FedEx tracking website so I was nervous it may not arrive or would be delayed. I emailed the company after 2 days of the tracking number not working and received no response. It turned out that my order did come on time, but there was some unnecessary trepidation as a result of a lack of a functioning tracking system and no response. 

In addition to the on time delivery, as an added plus, I also had 2 extra mylar bags throw in for free either by accident or courtesy.

Just wanted to pass along my experience.

Can someone please clarify for me?,15,8,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/preppers/comments/18vonq/im_confused_can_someone_please_clarify_for_me/,"So I've always heard and believed that storing food (i.e. 5 gal buckets of beans, flour, rice, and salt, and boocoos of canned goods) was a solid plan. As long as the containers were air tight and stored in the proper place they would keep for as long as needed. I'm beginning to get confused though, because ever since I joined this sub, I'm seeing more and more people talk about how it's a waste of time and money since you can just grow your own food. That's fine and dandy, I do plan on having a garden/crop, but all foods/herbs don't grow year round. Another confusion is rotating stock. If I have to worry about rotating goods to prevent it going bad than it's not something I would be interested in stocking anyway. I'm asking for clarification because I'm fairly new to the prepping lifestyle and am still in the planning phase. I've got a few priorities higher on my list like employment and transportation before I can start actually putting my plans into affect. That is why I joined this and other subs like it so I know exactly what I'm doing and not diving into muddy water head first. Any advice/constructive criticism is welcome and not just on the food bit either. Once I start buying my supplies and implementing my plan, I'll be flooding this place with questions anyway, so I'm all ears.

Does anyone know if I can use a Brunton Solaris 62 folding portable solar panel (or a better one that you know of) to charge a Zero Motorcycles Zero DS ZF9 (or better electric motorcycle that you know of)? My limited understanding of batteries and electricity makes me think I would need to use eight of these at once to do it.

The quiet running, off-road capable Zero DS ZF9 (which itself is described as requiring almost no maintenance) has battery cell that are supposed to last 3,000 full charge-discharge cycles (up to 300,000 miles), so solar panels that will work for years and fit in a backpack when folded would be a nice companion. I have links below for the specifications on both. Thanks for any help you can offer!

This is a great sub for preppers who have the opportunity to stock supplies and such, but I thought it would be cool to also put together some information that could be really helpful if STHF.

Here's what I mean. My family consists of me, my husband, and our 2 young girls. We live in Florida, where basement or cellar is impossible, and we rent our home and don't own any property. We have a crappy car, a couple of firearms and a little ammo, and two BOBs with the bare essentials to keep our family going for a little while. 

For someone in our situation, it seems that we would fare better by adapting to our surroundings and knowing how to survive without a stocked shelter. I'm sure there are plenty of people in similar situations, and in cases like ours, I think learning skills and remembering alternative survival methods are vital.

Any tips or tricks or alternative survival methods that anyone has would be really helpful. 

Here's some that I have already picked up and tried or committed to memory, so feel free to add to this.

1. Starting a fire with magnesium anode rod from water heater. (Same as a magnesium fire starter)
2. [Staring a fire with a can and some chocolate](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipMd5A7eUsc)
3. [Several ways to purify water.](http://www.survivaloutdoorskills.com/purifying_water.htm)
4. [Survival basic first aid with infection guide.](http://www.wilderness-survival.net/medicine-6.php)

Any other tips or information that would help those of us who aren't able to prep as usual?

To store water, why couldn't I put a storage tank between my incoming city water line and say, a toilet.

The idea is the water would come in off the street, fill up a 55 gallon drum, then move onto my normal use.

While everything is fine, the storage tank continually fills with fresh water, then feeds what ever I want to use it for on a daily basis.

In an emergency, I automatically have 55 gallons of fresh water ready for use.

And if setup properly (like in an attic) my toilet/shower/sink would still work without changing anything since the pressure would come from gravity, not the city.

Anyway...any thoughts on this?

This was the first time we've needed what I'd stock piled and we learned that neither puts out as much heat as we need/hoped and that the stove put out enough fumes that we had to open a window which cost us the accumulated heat in half the house. I'm eyeballing kerosene lamps because we've got lots of dog-proof places to set/hang them and because it sounds like they could provide all three (cooking/heating/light) but I'm finding mixed opinions on the fume issue.

What less of us maybe simply haven't taken the time to think about it, is that prepping isn't entirely about getting the supplies needed for after an event - for indeed, *part of prepping is the decisions we make that allow us to prep* - which can be something as simple as cutting back on money expenditures by watching movies at home instead of at theaters - or making stews a lot, as they're very economical in terms of re-heating/eating.

I guess my suggestions and questions here are under the ""life style"" aspect, but I digress - does anyone know of any lesser known but effective cell phone carriers or internet providers/devices? I know at Wal Mart they have cell phones that ""piggy back"" off of networks, but I'm weary - has anyone actually done this? Is it reliable?

When I get home later - I will post something a friend told me about - it's this wireless internet device that you pay literally one annual fee for or something and you can take it anywhere with you and plug it into any device. It's a way to save money to put towards more preps.

I recently have paid off a huge sum of credit card debt (about 50% paid, 1-2 payments left) and am getting ready to move out of the family home and find a place for myself. Now the reason why I let this bit of information out there is because:

* My family looks at my ""hobby"" of prepping to be unusual and wasteful. If I look up the prices and reviews of dehydrators, they think that's weird. If I come back from the local supermarket with a bunch of handwarmers for a good deal, they'll say it's wasteful. 

* For the last few years, I've picked up a liking of firearms, but can't really go beyond renting firearms at a gun range and looking at gun blogs because my family is very anti-gun. So much so, my mother has asked me to stop saying even the word gun as she would literally get headaches talking to me about it.

So as I'm learning more about being financially responsible, I've written up a budget for myself on how much I want to save (total amount from 6 months rent+utilities+min. living expenses). I also plan on saving $5k for things I've wanted to purchase for some time. Some of those things do have some relevance (e.g. firearms, safe for firearms, dehydrator, food grade vacuum sealer, hamm radios, etc.) and some not that much (30""-40"" HDTV, high-end desktop computer, ikea furniture, etc.) But along the way.... I totally forgot about prepping. While obtaining prepping gear can be done somewhat frugally, you're still spending money, which can add up to a very high credit card statement if you're not paying close attention to it.

So what is your prepping ""budget""? Does 10% of your budget go to growing and dehydrating fruits and veggies grown in the back yard? Maybe you spend $20/week on building an emergency car kit? Is your prepping budget over 20% of your total budget? I'd like to know where to start, I'm thinking of maybe $100/month but not sure yet.


TL;DR


-Moving out of family household primarily due to them looking at my desire to prep as unusual and wasteful
-Saving money to find an apartment, learning how to budget my lifestyle
-Looking for either a percentage of income or actual monetary value of how much is spent or recommended on prepping tools/materials for a month.",,False,self,t5_2riow,False,,,True,t3_1742io,http://www.reddit.com/r/preppers/comments/1742io/what_is_your_prepping_budget_questions_from_a/,

I hate the loss of water for something for only aesthetic purposes. 


So for the past 2 years, with prepping in mind, I have been making my 2+ acres an 'edible' landscape! The front yard is strictly for the publics eye, however behind a 6 ft fence and prickly blackberry barrier, the backyard is where abundance flows!


I had to consider all factors when growing food; protein, carbohydrates, veggies and fruit.


For protein, I have planted nut trees; chestnut, almond, filbert, beechnut, hickory, and pecans. Each species of nut....I planted 3 different cultivars (for all fruit/nut trees) By planting different cultivars, this greatly assists in the production and pollination. 


I did the same for all my fruit trees (too many to list). 3 cultivars for each fruit. The production after 2 years is outstanding!


I also planted a whole raised garden bed with Amaranth and couscous.
I have many raised gardens, all 10 ft x 3 x 3, and I am approaching 20+. All beds are strategically placed to maximize sunlight from morning to 6pm....after 6, I like to ensure the plants have some shade. It really improves the flavor for everything except tomatoes. All of my beds were built with hugulculture in mind; this is the 3rd year of the program, and it is amazing how much water you save utilizing this!   

Regarding carbohydrates, I can plant and maintain potatoes, corn, and beans. You get a LOT more carbs per sq ft with potatoes then corn, and taters need a LOT less water and fertilizer. 


In a pinch, any person can trap the local cotton tails and have an unlimited supply of protein. I also believe the same could be said for quail, and if necessary, head out to the local park and pick up as many breeding pairs of ducks/geese as you can! You will have to quarantine and medicate, however in a closed chicken run, you could raise a large flock for your freezer pretty quickly.


Last but not least, I have had great success in utilizing the dreaded blackberry as an impenetrable barrier along my fence line! I had idiot neighbor kids hopping my fence to use the hot tub, now not even the local cat scoots by! It is a true bitch having to trim it back every year though. 



Does anyone else have any tips or pointers in making their yard a strong source of food in case the SHTF? I have a really strong rain catchment all ready, as well as a flourishing bee hive nestled among my french lavender.

There are tons of plant books out there describing standard veggies and fruits so I'm focusing on plants which help with the details of daily life such as soap, toilet paper, string/rope, oil, cleaning products, cold medicine, etc. but also including some low-maintenance perennial edible plants. My intent is to introduce new gardeners to the idea that purely-ornamental plants can be swapped out for those which serve other purposes as well. There will be about 8 books, each listing about 50 plants with their care and usage. I will self-publish with a print-on-demand printer. 

**It would mean a great deal to me if you guys gave me your thoughts on which of the topics below interest you the most:**


1. **Edible Perennial Plants** (long-lived veggies/fruits/nuts you can landscape with)

2. **Hygiene Plants** (soap, shampoo, toilet paper, toothbrush/paste, etc.)

3. **Medicinal &amp; First Aid Plants** (cold medicine, antiseptic, bandages, etc.)

4. **Kitchen &amp; Cleaning** (scrubber, dishwashing liquid, plates/cups, cleaning solution, etc.)

5. **Building Material Plants** (rope, containers &amp; baskets, wood for garden structures and firewood, oil and wax, etc.)

6. **Pest Management Plants** (natural pesticide sprays, mosquito repellents, gopher deterrents, etc.)

7. **Defense Plants** (thorny plants for fences, natural barriers, etc.)

8. **Animal Feed Plants** (what to feed your livestock, chickens, rabbits, etc.)

9. **Herb, Spice, &amp; Condiment Plants** (common herbs/spices, making your own ketchup/mustard, etc.)

10. **Coffee, Tea, and Juice Plants** (coffee and alternatives, plants you may already be growing which make tasty teas, etc.)

11. **Plants for Bugging Out** (identifying wild plants for foraging, plants which grow quickly and are conducive to temporary locations, etc.)

12. **Edible &amp; Useful Plants** (the top few plants from each of the categories above, i.e. an overview)

May be too soon, but now that we've seen the end of the Feinstein's ban on semi-auto rifles with military cosmetic features, I'd like to discuss whether anyone across the US has seen in change in retail ammunition availability.

If you keep any surplus of ammunition, you will know the economics of it all, but for those who do not, I will explain.  The number of AR15 variant rifles sold over the past few years has exploded with numerous new manufacturers and it has become one of the most popular rifles in the US.  

Standard AR15s shoot a .223 Rem or 5.56mm NATO, ammunition which used to be cheaper to buy new than to reload your own-- roughly, less than $0.30 per round.  Today bulk ammo prices have skyrocketed to $1.50-$2.00 per round; I have seen 1,000 round cases go for $1,500.00+.  So naturally, people move to reloading supplies, but they too have become nearly impossible to find and prices have spiked as well.

My initial thoughts were that the market would adjust itself and we'd see a massive flood of cheap Russian and Serbian imported ammunition.  But so far I have not seen it.

Any changes experienced by anyone in the US?

Well, all of it's lacking, as I currently own a tunberware container of some basic stuff that could come in handy. Money is virtually nonexistant, and I'm 16 and I don't have a job to pay for much supplies. I am currently saving up for a shotgun, but 10 dollars a week isn't getting me there fast. I was planning on using it for hunting purposes, as I hate having to borrow my relative's. Anyway, I have a grand total of 53 dollars saved up, in cash, plus a few more in uncounted change. Should I postpone the shotgun for now and start storing non-perishables, or continue towards the gun? I do have a .22/.177 pellet gun with ammo so I know I can use that as well. Now, I live in an old house, that leaks when there is any moderate rain into the basment in the only spot that's good for food storage. It doesn't actually get into where the food that's stored down there for the week now, but it can. I was wondering if that would pose a problem, as it is vey cool, and sometimes freezing down there, and moist, when it came to certain foods.

1352657167.0,5,self.preppers,130naq,How good do you think your planning skills really are?  This is a serious book for serious planning.,5,0,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/preppers/comments/130naq/how_good_do_you_think_your_planning_skills_really/,"http://www.thelightningpress.com/smartbooks/the-battle-staff-smartbook-3rd-rev-ed/

  It seems like most of the questions I have heard about prepping are short, and the answers are typically short. ( e.g. How much food should I have? What is the best way to spend $100?)  These little thought experiments are a great way to exercise you mind, but fall short when taken in the context of planning for an actual disaster.

The SMARTbooks are filled with condensed high-quality operational planning guidelines.  If you have never been a part of a professional, high-level scenario planning operation these books will really open your eyes.  Proper planning has a level of complexity, subtly and nuance that is unrecognized by the uninitiated until they are confronted with hard reality.  Prepping is about preparing and planning for contingencies.  Planning means more than a back-of-a-napkin reflection of ""what would I do?"". The Battle Staff SMARTbook is a great analog for any kind of disaster planning.  Trying to figure out the details in the heat of the moment can have some serious negative consequences.  And on the bright side, proper planning takes all those fun little questions and short answers and compiles them into a single comprehensive plan.

I am personally more familiar with MCPP (Marine Corps Planning Process) while the SMARTbooks use MDMP (Military Decision Making Process).  However, MCPP and MDMP are very similar and I never found a book that does a better job of encapsulating military planning.  We used these a lot in Afghanistan (and back home).  I also have the Small Unit Tactics and Leaders SMARTbook and think highly of them as well, but I recommend the Battle Staff book for the planning aspect.  I saw on the website they have come out with a few more books since the last time I checked (The Stability, Peace and Counter Insurgency looks interesting).  They also might be worth checking out.  My opinion is that this book should be one of the first things someone should buy if they are serious about contingency planning.",,False,self,t5_2riow,1352690067.0,,,True,t3_130naq,http://www.reddit.com/r/preppers/comments/130naq/how_good_do_you_think_your_planning_skills_really/,

Come to find out that the grand mother of two of my friends(brother and sister) is concerned with preparation and survival for her family(Grandmothers are awesome).  She has done some very limited things such as buying a few supplies, but in my opinion, and by her own self admission she recognizes that she has a long way to go.  She is concerned for her two grandchildren, and I completely understand this position as my own grandmother has made it clear to me that she worries for me when something goes bad in my life and she can't be there.

The grandmother found out that I prep, albeit I do what I can when I can(never feels like its enough).  I really want to help her and guide her, but I'm far from an expert on this as I'm still learning.

Project wise, I'm thinking of starting her and my two friends on car kits and a 72 hour kit.  It's what I started with before I did my BoB and then longer term food storage and other equipment.  I figure that a car survival kit and/or a 72 hour kit should be a good first step in figuring out what to do for survival, and getting a good mindset to wrap around the goal of being prepared.  Outside of the initial project, It is my hope to start them on the way of preparedness if they decide to go forward with it.

Imagine units of 8-10 soldiers entering boar infested areas and hunting them. Living in the bush in these ""deployments""

There probably isn't a better training tool for developing communication and stalking technique. You could deploy in full battle rattler and actually go out in the bush and kill shit. People pay for boar eradication sometimes and if the boar meat isn't edible, sell it to dog food companies maybe.

Many people seem to treat them as a sort of reverse bug out bag, sometimes even including dehydrated food or sleeping bags.  The most common elements appear to be based on the idea that the person is going to be forced to walk back to their home, usually from work.

But under what circumstances would this actually be required?  It assumes that your car is disabled, you can't call anyone for assistance, and there has been enough social breakdown that things like AAA or towing services aren't working either.  If the social situation is that far gone I expect you likely won't be at work anyway.  Or, if you are at work your preparation would consist of a lot more than a tiny little GHB.

There are many factors to consider.

Canada is a first world country with a lot of resources and even a fairly decent economy. The main con I have are the winters. Surviving the harsh colds here in emergencies can prove difficult, and I am not sure how realistic growing your own foods would be here. Though, I think global warming will have a positive effect on Canada. Also, with the slow economic collapse of USA, I am not sure how much better Canada would fare.

Another conflict: One wants &gt;2 acres of land but needs to stay close to work (city). Also, the idea of living &gt;100km away from any city effectively destroys any possibility of a decent job in the city. This clashes with the idea that one is better off making a salary as long as possible to be able to survive (economically). Job opportunities in small town are negligible.

Last year, a subreddit was created by /u/Alyeska2112. It was called /r/I_am_the_last_one. With over 1.4k subscribers, the subreddit was a hit and ended on its **planned** date of December 31, 2012 (the apocalypse). People wanted more, so I created a subreddit called /r/I_am_the_first_one with intentions of continuing the story after the apocalypse along with some new ""interactive"" aspects.

What made /r/I_am_the_last_one so successful was the user content. We've created unique guidelines and rules to follow. We did this by taking the most popular ""recurring themes"" found in everyone's stories and created a type of ""rendezvous"" point in which everyone comes together to understand the ""most popular"" themes and include them in their stories.

We just started again and are trying to get back up to over 1k subscribers. If you're interested, you are more than welcome to join us survivors. I hope to hear your stories over at /r/I_am_the_first_one!

Nearly every website explaining long term storage use seems to imply that one should cycle their water every 6 months. The main concept, as I understand it, is because of bacteria growth. Bacteria in the air will grow in water just as they would in food. The speed at which they grow is a function of heat and light. So the true shelf life is location specific.

1360308488.0,3,self.preppers,184d34,Product Review - Grumpy's Paracord Products,5,2,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/preppers/comments/184d34/product_review_grumpys_paracord_products/,"*Note: I have received no compensation for this write up. I just figured I would share my experience with everyone.*

I haven't seen any self written product reviews recently, so I figured I'd write one for some of the merchandise I've bought lately. Just recently, I bought a few products from a company called *[Grumpy's Paracord Products](https://www.facebook.com/GrumpysParacord)*. These included:

- (2) Paracord Survival Bracelets [(Charcoal Gray)](https://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-snc7/430924_452221741494273_1963632301_n.jpg) [(Copperhead)](https://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash4/196859_452222661494181_1265062820_n.jpg)
- [Small Knife, paracord handle](https://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/481219_451277891588658_949683240_n.jpg)
- [Monkey fist, 6"" tether with 3/4"" ball bearing](https://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-prn1/58637_450801934969587_782828479_n.jpg)
- [Monkey fist, 6"" tether with 1 1/4"" ball bearing](https://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/540860_451575414892239_1072771903_n.jpg)
- [Double Monkey fist, 12"" tether with (2) 1 1/4"" ball bearings](https://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash4/303673_452105778172536_1318983027_n.jpg)

I found this company by one of those ""Like"" giveaways a lot of military gear companies have been doing on Facebook lately. I wasn't aware of it, but Mr. Grumpy is out of Elsworth, SD which is decently close to me, so I figured I would give his company a try.

I had wanted to buy some survival bracelets for a while, and while searching through his site, I found the Monkey Fists. I found these useful, as I can't carry my Glock at work or a few other places, and wanted some protection for these times. I figured this would fit the bill. I had the [small monkey fist with the 3/4"" bearing](https://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-prn1/58637_450801934969587_782828479_n.jpg) made for my girlfriend and the [6"" tethered monkey fist with the 1 1/4"" bearing](https://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/540860_451575414892239_1072771903_n.jpg) made for myself for this purpose. I am currently looking for a couple smooth metal rings to loop the handle straps on so that I can attach them to a key ring. I don't want to just use a key ring, as I am afraid the key ring would snag and fray the paracord. If anyone knows where I can find such a thing, let me know. I made the keychain for me with the 1 1/4"" bearing just to add a little ""oomph"" to any force I could apply with it, and it seems to do the trick. Decent weight that I'm able to swing quickly.

I keep the [small knife](https://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/481219_451277891588658_949683240_n.jpg) in my Get-Home-Bag so that when work sends me on trips, I have a decent bladed weapon. I obviously haven't had to use it yet, but the handle is decently comfortable for a cheaper blade, and sharp enough to cut anything I need it to.

The [Double Monkey Fist](https://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash4/303673_452105778172536_1318983027_n.jpg) is also in my get home bag. I used one of my [belay devices](http://www.amazon.com/Black-Diamond-Device-Assorted-Colors/dp/B000S8WOOY/ref=sr_1_8?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1360307362&amp;sr=8-8&amp;keywords=belay+device) as a handle and it seems to work pretty well. [(Picture Here)](http://i.imgur.com/whsrKtS.jpg) With the amount of weight out on the end of this, however, once you give it a few full hard swings, the weight of these 2 large bearings seems to deform the paracord pattern some. Not enough to let the bearings slip out or anything, but it doesn't look as nice when you're done. Not that big of a deal to me, though. I'll probably buy another one of these, but get the 3/4"" bearings in it instead to be able to swing it a bit faster. 

The bracelets are just basic bracelets, as you can see in [this picture](http://i.imgur.com/OtkHdLr.jpg). They fit well, are comfortable, and functional. I'm not a big jewelry type person, so it took a bit to get used to wearing a bracelet. I might buy a blue one in addition to the ones I have to satisfy my OCD for when I wear blue clothing (the gray and copper look odd, and my work is formal enough that if it looks odd like that, someone's going to mention it.)

All in all, I'm happy with the purchase. It seems that the owner of Grumpy's is always experimenting with new ideas for paracord products, so check out his page. His prices are fair, and he has new stuff pretty constantly. You can get almost any color you'd want, and it's a good product. Take that as you may.

I can't say that it will happen nationally or not, but in looking back at hurricane Katrina I really don't like the idea of the authorities taking my only form of defense and if need be, my preferred method of hunting.

Here's how this happens (federally, rules differ from state to state), *all* store bought guns are registered, when you buy a gun the serial number of that gun gets tied to your name, this is why you have forms to fill out that go to the ATF. This is the federal record of who has what, your state may have other laws regarding record keeping but this is done for everyone who buys a gun from a FFL holder.

Where things get messy is buying a gun for a gift, a serial is tied to a buyer, not to the person getting the gun as a birthday present. Another point is the person to person sale, in the state I live in this is legal, some states it is not. I could grow tired of a gun and sell it to someone, anyone, without any background check (it is your responsibility to make sure they are of legal age, and to cover yourself you should have some sort of bill of sale written up).

So, the basis of this post is that I was reading some stuff on the ATF web site and came across [this FAQ](http://www.atf.gov/firearms/faq/firearms-technology.html#commercial-parts-assembly), where it says:

&gt; an unlicensed individual may make a “firearm” as defined in the GCA for his own personal use, but not for sale or distribution.

I then did some Google-Fu and came across [Ares Armor](http://aresarmor.com/) that sold 80% complete AR-15 lowers, this is the part that is normally serialized and what the ATF considers to be ""the gun"". But as being that the trigger control group is not milled out it is considered to be a paperweight. And all other parts can be bought without restriction.

So, if the call comes down to take the guns of the citizens, at least you can have one that they don't have a record of (if you are handy with a drill press).

Ares Armor also have [this video](http://youtu.be/30i_6awxEG4) as a general tutorial on it. Remember this may not be legal in your state, make sure you check on that if you decide to order.",,False,self,t5_2riow,False,,,True,t3_133dcb,http://www.reddit.com/r/preppers/comments/133dcb/gun_preps_and_the_potential_of_not_having_one/,

So why haven't more people prepared themselves when disasters are striking us more and more frequently? 

I was one of those people. 

Four days after Hurricane Sandy made landfall, the need for disaster prep became evident as I sat in a darkened apartment, lit only by lanterns and flashlights, desperate for my husband to return from a trip to find emergency propane. My family had prepared for the hurricane, but we had holes in our preparation plan. We didn’t know what we were missing…until we needed it. 

That experience was the impetus for my newest book ORDINARY PEOPLE-EVERYDAY PREP - my journey to better understand what a good disaster preparation plan should be, and how to put one into place.  

Now, I need help raising the funds needed to bring this book to publication. Kickstarter mandates that I must raise the funds by 7-12-13, or I don't receive any of it. Can you help? The prepping community knows better than anyone how important this is. And you can play a part in bringing this project to life.

I've been working with a startup based out of New Orleans.  We've created an online software tool (not yet live) that helps people with disaster preparedness, but more pointedly assists users with post-disaster recovery.  With this tool, you can

- upload and *securely* store personal documents, including identification, medical records, insurance information, and pictures of valuables like art or other possessions

- create evacuation plans with a map interface

- send free SMS messages to anyone

- receive alerts for your area (e.g. severe weather)

and more. 

There is also a social networking component, but it's not an open network like Facebook (although you can use the tool to sync with Twitter or Facebook to communicate with people).  Here are two examples:

1. A tree lands on your car during a storm.  With this tool, you can immediately upload a picture, send it to your insurance agent with a message and begin a claim right away.

2. Massive local power outages, but your street still has power.  You send messages to your relatives who are in your ""circle"" on our private network telling them to come by and keep their cellphones charged if they want- this is a good alternative to letting all your Facebook friends know you have power and having a crowd show up at your door. 

There are some other components to this software, but that's a very brief overview.  In other words, this tool allows you to organize your preps and safely store your valuable information online, but also maintain communication with loved ones in times of crises.  Further, it quickens the return to normal by facilitating recovery after a disaster.  The tool can be used by individuals or by businesses. 

We have one of the largest US retailers on board to put this in their store, but we're going to do a few months of online advertising only before putting it in the stores.  One of the things we are doing ahead of time is a few quick surveys about price points.  The cost of purchasing is for a yearly subscription to the service.  There are two packages- the difference between the two is the amount of online document/photo storage available. 

**If you were to purchase a year of this product, how much would you be willing to spend before the cost outweighs the value of the ""insurance"" provided by the product?**

A. $8.99

B. $12.99

C. $19.11

D. $25.00

Thank you so much in advance for your response.  I'm not going to link to the software itself because that would be spamming, but if you're interested, PM me and I'll let you know when it goes live.",,False,self,t5_2riow,False,,,True,t3_1c8by2,http://www.reddit.com/r/preppers/comments/1c8by2/how_much_would_you_pay_to_be_prepared_for_any/,

* This is what it is:
http://cd3wd.com/download/index.htm
* It's a pretty huge file if you have to download it yourself. You would be getting a serious of zip files, that's how the library is distributed. 
* These are multiple ISO files in one package. You must know how to mount an ISO file as a virtual drive. Windows users need extra (free) software to do this. Mounting an ISO file is built-in to a Mac and Linux. 
* On the ISO files are mostly PDF files. You will need a PDF reader also. 
* In the continental  US postage is free.

Family member has a decent amount of $ coming available and I'm advising to put some into physical gold and silver.

In the past I visited a gold/sivler jewelry pawn type coin store and the guy said something about the difference between buying retail, and then at some $ amount the transaction is treated as an investment.  It's been awhile and I've forgotten.

Does anyone know the amounts, rules, differences and considerations for this given a preference to acquire physical gold/silver in a way that is NOT documented and still able to get best price?
