There are a lot of posts out there that focus on what CISPA is and what it will do. The overwhelming consensus on reddit is that it is indeed bad. I've heard a lot of negative things, including that my rights might be infringed if it does pass.

But there are two sides to every story. The bill clearly has some support in Congress, the business community has embraced it, and even some big internet firms like [Google](http://thehill.com/blogs/hillicon-valley/technology/223069-google-acknowledges-lobbying-on-cybersecurity-bill-cispa) are lobbying for it. 

The goal of the [bill](http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c112:H.R.3523:), according to the title, is to address global cybersecurity threats, which I understand are [an increasing problem.](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/27/us/cyberattacks-are-up-national-security-chief-says.html?_r=0&amp;pagewanted=print)

If I am to form an opinion on a matter, I want to hear and give credence to what people from both sides have to say, and this sub has a reputation for looking at issues with a balanced perspective, so I ask you, /r/NeutralPolitics, is there anything good that can come from passing CISPA?",,False,,t5_2tk0i,False,,,True,t3_1cn5b6,http://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/1cn5b6/most_of_reddit_is_severely_anticispa_so_i_came/,
1366086707.0,332,self.NeutralPolitics,1cfxnq,[META] Please assume good faith and moderate your tone when commenting,372,40,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/1cfxnq/meta_please_assume_good_faith_and_moderate_your/,"We've received a handful of messages from OPs who have left the sub as a result of the kinds of comments that they receive on their posts. As such, we'd like to take some time to look at good and bad ways to respond to posts. Even if you assume good faith already, I invite you to read this post so that you can help encourage it in the future.

In /r/NeutralPolitics, we believe that assuming good faith is **vital** to having good discussion. When someone posts something we disagree with, we find that the best way to deal with it is with a reasoned, fact based reaction, as opposed to an angry (even if fact based) reaction. Here are a few good guidelines for responding:

* Assume that OP misunderstands the issue before assuming willful ignorance or malice. Many people post here because they are unaware of the arguments against them, and want to find out what those are.
* Woo the OP to ""your side"", don't chastise them for holding an opinion you disagree with. You'll catch more flies with honey than with flame wars.
* Avoid *ad hominem* attacks. If your post contains a lot of ""I"" and ""You"", you're probably talking about the OP, not the issue. This is often a sign of a weak argument, since if you have a good argument, talking about the issue should be enough to persuade someone.
* Please do not use sarcasm or rhetorical questions. Rhetorical questions can only have negative consequences, they never contribute towards good dialogue. Sarcasm can only inflame, it can't inform.

Let's look at an example. Say I made a post about a controversial issue, like this:

&gt;I think that the US should stop funding public education. Teachers get paid way too much and we need to reduce the debt. [sources about teacher salaries and the national debt]

Now, depending on your views, you may feel very angered by this admittedly poorly worded and simplistic post. Many top level comments would probably look like this:

&gt;""I think that the US should stop funding public education."" Yeah, sure. And maybe we should stop paving roads while we're at it, since that would reduce the deficit too.

&gt;""Teachers get paid way too much and we need to reduce the debt."" Teachers are paid a pittance [source]. If you think being a teacher is so easy, why don't you try being one?

When you have 20 replies like this in your inbox, it can be stressful to try and read through them and respond. Here's a much more constructive way to argue against the OP.

&gt;Education is actually a pretty small part of the national budget [source]. Not to mention that American teachers are paid way less than teachers in other developed countries [source]. Studies [source] have shown that public education leads to a more skilled population that can better compete in a global marketplace. If Americans are earning more money, we can pay back the debt faster.

&gt;Do you still feel that education is a waste of federal budget? If so, why?

Something to note here: After attempting to persuade the reader with their argument, this commenter invites honest feedback on whether they've been convincing, and allows the OP (or any reader) to change their view without shaming them for the views they may have held before. This is key.

In reading [this article,](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-22809541) where the US Director of National Intelligence justifies recently revealed government intrusions into private communications, I noticed him make a very common conflation of two concepts that sound similar, but I propose to be distinct: **protecting America versus protecting *Americans*.**

The programs the director is defending are presumably counter-terrorism efforts. But in order to accept that thwarting terrorism is equivalent to protecting America, you have to believe that terrorist plots represent an existential threat to the nation. That means the potential attacks would be a coordinated effort likely to kill many millions of citizens, cripple our infrastructure, defeat our military and compromise our government institutions all at once. [The evidence doesn't support that terrorism rises to this level.](http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2013/04/statistics-you-are-not-going-to-be-killed-by-terrorists.html)

The Soviet Union, with its bellicose threats and thousands of nuclear-tipped ICBMs aimed at the US, represented an existential threat to the nation. Imperial Japan, having invaded dozens of lands in a steady, five-year march across the Pacific, culminating in a full-scale aerial assault on a US naval base, represented an existential threat to the nation. Nazi Germany, having conquered half of Europe in just two years, and with its submarines attacking US shipping within sight of the East coast, represented an existential threat to the US.

Instead, what I think the Director is saying — probably without recognizing a distinction — is that these terrorists are a threat to American *lives.* But that's not the same thing. The loss of American lives, tragic as it is, does not in itself represent a threat to the nation.

In fact, it could be argued that the best way to protect America — traditionally the land of freedom, liberty, and justice under the law — would be to eliminate all these domestic surveillance programs, targeted killings, indefinite detention and the other associated anti-terrorism measures, because they themselves are a bigger threat to the American way of life than anything a terrorist can muster. But if we accept that terrorism does represent *some* level of threat (albeit not existential), supporting a reduction in counter-terrorism efforts means we would accept higher risk to our personal safety in exchange.

So, the question then becomes, are you willing to slightly increase the risk to your life in order to protect what it means to be American, or do you believe that it's the responsibility of the military to protect American lives, potentially at the cost of the American *way* of life?

-----

I'd like to make two observational side notes here: 

1. Reddit's readership skews decidedly young. If you were born after roughly 1988, America has been on a war footing since you were a teenager. You probably have no personal memory of what American society felt like prior to the September 11, 2001 attacks. There was no TSA, no Patriot Act, no warrantless wiretaps, no Department of Homeland Security, no prison at Guantanamo Bay, no drones, no ""Homeland"" or ""24,"" and most importantly, terrorism was generally seen as something that happened far away. For you folks, defending ""the American way of life"" may seem like a foreign concept, because for your entire adult life, this is the way America has been. I'm making some broad assumptions here, and I'm sure not everyone falls into this category, but as an older redditor, I want to point out that a large portion of the population remembers what it felt like to live in a country where the recently revealed government intrusions would have been considered a shocking overreach, rather than part and parcel of an extensive security mindset.
2. The traditional job of the US military has been to protect the nation from *existential threats,* while it's the role of law enforcement agencies to protect *American lives.* One of the reasons we don't involve the military in law enforcement tasks is because they have the tendency to view everything, including the citizens, as a threat.

Hi all,

We would first like to begin with a quote from /u/BatCountry9 that sums up the heart of this issue perfectly:

&gt; IMO, the only rational stance is one of agnosticism. We'll never know exactly what happened, second to second, in Florida last year. Unfortunately, all the missing facts and grey areas in this case served not to make the public demand real facts, but provided people with a blank template onto which they've imprinted their own version of the story complete with personal political leanings and prejudices.

&gt; It's an ugly mess and I don't think this entire ordeal has helped anyone.

The NP mod team has decided that the Zimmerman issue is so shrouded in rhetoric and low-quality information that any discussion about it will be flawed from the outset. Without sufficient available information, the only possible responses consist of conjecture and personal judgments - exactly the sort of content that we discourage (and remove) at NeutralPolitics. As a result, any further posts about the Zimmerman trial or the political soap opera that it has engendered will be deleted.

If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free (as always) to talk about it here and we would be happy to discuss the decision. Thanks!

Some things he has commented on:

1) USA would be a terrorist state if international laws were applied to them

2) The US spends billions on propaganda, and marketing creates uninformed citizens incapable of making rational purchasing choices.

3) Education is for conforming and in a way brainwashing students to fit into the mainstream, and not for critical thinking, etc.

4) There's a constant war on the poor, and on the workers by the corporations and government aids the corporations through legislation

And there's the war on drugs, etc, etc.

Just to add my own view, I can see and understand what he says, but whenever I watch C-Span, or more ""serious"" rich CEO's, economists and so forth, I feel there's a whole other side to the US government, the military and the financial system that I simply do not understand.

I just wanted to note that /r/NeutralPolitics has impressed me as a sub where reason is placed well above bias-confirmation. It is a place where you can make arguments contrary to the popular opinion of Reddit and not be downvoted, if your ideas are well reasoned. With that in mind, I'd like to explain why I have not shared in the outrage that I've seen so many Redditors express over the recent NSA scandal.

First, there needs to be some basic agreement on the facts of the scandal: the actions that the NSA took have been [very](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1g0102/in_2001_the_nsa_contacted_the_ceo_of_qwest_joseph/) [frequently](http://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/1fxkwl/president_richard_nixon_resigned_after/) [referred to as](http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1fw1ra/so_just_to_be_clear_nixon_resigned_because_he_got/) [wiretapping](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1fsb5d/obama_no_warrantless_wiretaps_if_you_elect_me/). This is a misstatement of fact; wiretapping refers to the monitoring of phone calls. *Nothing has changed about judicial requirements for wiretapping.* If you have been following this scandal closely, you know that it revolves around the NSA's culling of metadata, which consists of phone numbers and call durations. This is not ""wiretapping"", and I am not playing semantics.

I am open to arguments that the collection of this metadata is undesirable, but the debate on most of Reddit has been stymied by this lack of understanding. To illustrate what I mean, I'll share a quick anecdote: a friend of mine texted me yesterday telling me that he was worried about the country because of this scandal. I asked him what worried him so much, and he told me ""Someone could be reading this conversation right now. That's Orwellian."" It would be Orwellian if it was true, but it's not. Ordinarily, my friend is very informed about politics, but the popular conversation surrounding this debate has become so muddled with fervor that it is utterly disconnected from the real facts of this case.

With that in mind, is this a real scandal? I say it is not. I've discussed this subject with a few people who hold opposing opinions, but what I've noticed is that the opposing argument does not rely so much on the facts of what the government is doing but speculation of what the government could do. The government still requires probable cause and a judge's approval before monitoring your calls, however, and for that reason I can't see how this represents a loss of civil liberty.

I've asked the mods about it and was told it will turn into a nightmare thread; that no one could remain neutral.

I'm a 30 year old white male, with libertarian leanings.  Two of my good friends teach at inner city schools and I'm constantly hearing of the nightmares they endure.

I kept ""Is there a problem..."" in the thread title to try to remain neutral.  If someone is able to argue that there is no problem, or that the problems of Black America are no worse than any other race, I'm open to hear it.  Still, I have a hard time believing there isn't something terribly wrong.

[About 12.4%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States) of the population of the US is Black.

[According to the BJS non-Hispanic blacks accounted for 39.4% of the prison and jail population in 2009.](http://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=pbdetail&amp;iid=2200)

Drop out rates for Black students have [declined](http://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=16), but are still higher than the national average.

[72%](http://www.nbcnews.com/id/39993685/ns/health-womens_health/t/blacks-struggle-percent-unwed-mothers-rate/#.Uebh8tLVAsI) of Black babies are born to unwed mothers.

* ""The black community's 72 percent rate eclipses that of most other groups: 17 percent of Asians, 29 percent of whites, 53 percent of Hispanics and 66 percent of Native Americans were born to unwed mothers in 2008, the most recent year for which government figures are available. The rate for the overall U.S. population was 41 percent.""

[Homicide](http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2013-04-09/news/fl-fau-black-homicide-20130409_1_young-black-men-homicide-rate-homicide-top-cause) is the leading killer of young Black men.

[1/3 of welfare recipients](http://www.cbpp.org/cms/?fa=view&amp;id=193) are Black.

I could go on and on about issues that seem to plague the Black community.  

My friend who is a teacher in NYC just recently found out one of her students had been stabbed to death.  The school and other students marched on as if nothing happened.

My friend who is a teacher in Northern* California tells me that his students have goals of failing.  That getting an F in history is something to be proud of and bragged about.  

He tells me that black parents are reactionary instead of proactive about their children in school.  They yell and scream when they find out the child isn't doing well, but do nothing to *during* the school year to make sure the child is keeping up on school work.

It may sound like a joke, but these problems confound me.  I think about them probably more than I should.  Collectivism and welfare to me are abominations, but I can't escape the fact that if 13% of our nation isn't doing well it is a drain on everyone.  

**So, I put it to you, Neutral Politics:  Is there a problem with Black America?  What ways can the free market help?  What ways can the government help?  What ways can the individual help?**

Of course it is also fair to point out how unrelated conclusions are unrelated! 

Is the ""Slippery Slope"" argument a fallacy, or is it a proper form of critical thinking to ask ""Where do you draw the line""?

EDIT2: It might be better to say that slipper slope arguments are appropriate when deployed judiciously, and you have reason to think they it is correct in this case (ie, ""we are discussing whether X will lead to Y; but X is similar to A, and Y is similar to B, and A has led to B in the past""), and fallacious if deployed as sort of a blanket ""X could lead to Y, and Y could lead to Z, therefore X will clearly cause Z"".

The idea behind this is that women feel objectified while exercising with men and they need special hours during which they can use the facilities.  

My question for you, do you believe that this falls under discrimination and sexism? After all, it is clearly denying service to a certain group of people due to their sex. Especially in the context of universities, this is denying tuition-paying students the right to use facilities that they are paying for. For this discussion, I think it is best that we stay on the subject of university and publicly funded gyms. Primarily because one could simply say that you can opt out of a gym if you disagree with Women-Only Hours.

In the case of a university, I am paying for the gym through my tuition no matter what. I don't get the choice to quit the gym as I would at a private facility. However, I am also only available to workout for a few hours each day. If women-only hours are set during those few hours that I have free, I am out of luck. I am then paying for a gym membership that I am not allowed to use because of my sex.

What are your thoughts on women-only hours at public gyms?

In the UK there is no such thing as entrenched legislation - the government could perfectly legally remove all and any rights UK citizens possess.  Of course, that would be exceptionally unlikely, but compared to the level of protection of rights in the States it pales in comparison.

This means the people, theoretically, have influence over government policy, and they're expected to vote based on being informed about the issues.

In that structure, what are the appropriate reasons for a government to deliberately keep the electorate *un*informed about a specific policy by classifying it as secret? And if the revelation of that policy would affect the direction of governance, is keeping it secret actually a subversion of democracy?

In light of recent revelations about secret government surveillance practices, it seems prudent to ask what the citizens should and shouldn't be informed about if they're expected to make informed choices at the ballot box.

When those in government want to do something — even with the best of intentions — that they reasonably suspect the people would *not* support, it seems to me they have two choices: don't do it, or do it and keep it secret. The latter is where we run into a potential problem.

Barton Gellman, reporting for the Washington Post, said of the leaked briefing about the NSA Prism program:

&gt; The most highly classified thing in this briefing, as far as the drafter was concerned — and he said it three different times:  ""These companies are very important to us. We can't do anything that would harm them."" Ah, and what he meant was reputational harm, market harm, uh, harm to their public images. And to me, when something is classified for the reason that companies are doing something which the public would strongly disapprove of is, is exactly the wrong reason to classify something. It is a strong reason to think that it's something that we ought to bring to light.

[Yesterday's story about Britain's GHCQ tapping fibre optic cables](http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2013/jun/21/gchq-cables-secret-world-communications-nsa?CMP=twt_gu) under secret agreements with commercial companies says that staff ""were urged in one internal guidance paper to disguise the origin of 'special source' material in their reports for fear that the role of the companies as intercept partners would cause 'high-level political fallout'"".

In other words, the secrecy was driven, at least in part, by a desire to keep these policies hidden from the government's *own* citizenry, for fear that the electorate might not support them.

We then later found out that most of the information the NSA was receiving was not from any elaborate spy network, but rather by [simply](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRISM_(surveillance_program) taking information given to corporations through [warrants and secret courts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Foreign_Intelligence_Surveillance_Court).

Now, I understand the problems with what the government did, even if they did them legally. I would like to know why people are willing to give up this information in the first place, to corporations who have histories of [price-gouging](http://www.nasdaq.com/article/apple-accused-of-pricegouging-australian-consumers-cm216370), [price-fixing](http://www.theverge.com/2012/4/11/2941053/inside-the-dojs-ebook-price-fixing-case-against-apple-an-analysis), [conspiracy](http://mybroadband.co.za/news/business/68784-google-apple-and-intel-illegal-hiring-conspiracy-hits-court.html), and [data loss](http://www.wired.com/gamelife/2011/05/sony-online-entertainment-hack/).

I know the government is far from perfect, and could be linked to far worse things, but does that really justify freely giving up all of our information to unscrupulous businesses?

Now, since the information is being freely given, I'm not accusing these corporations of doing anything wrong with *that* information, but we've also seen some of these corporations [collecting data](http://www.slashgear.com/iphone-and-ipad-3g-caught-keeping-secret-location-tracking-database-video-20147261/) without users knowledge. There is also a point to be made that the government is more beholden to the people. The only people with power in the government that aren't elected are the members of the Supreme Court (and lobbyists, imho), meaning that if they go too far out of what bounds we perceived for them, we can [kick them out of office](http://www.cnn.com/2003/ALLPOLITICS/07/24/davis.recall/index.html) or elect a better choice next time. Over corporations we are given no such choice, and in recent times we have seen it become [difficult](http://blogcritics.org/skip-bbthe-april-15-gas-out/) for organized [boycotts](http://www.examiner.com/article/walmart-black-friday-boycott-strike-threat-grows) to have an effect on corporate decisions. 

While I would rather stay completely anonymous, I think I would rather the government have access to my information when granted a warrant than any corporation. In today's day with smartphones (like [one](http://www.tuexperto.com/2012/09/05/nokia-lumia-820-analisis-a-fondo/) I am using now) it is near impossible to give up *no* information about yourself, but I try to minimalize it as best as I can, which (I now know) serves the dual purpose of keeping such information from wayward corporations and their ad companies, and also, keeping it out of the hands of the government and PRISM.

If people really want the government to stop snooping on their information, shouldn't they be more carefully about what kind, and to whom they give it to?

A lot of this argument is based into how there is no need for a law considering the divorce rate, the rate of births to unwed mothers and how many children are not being raised by their biological parents due to remarriage (it was hard to find stats for that).  

According to the CDC the [rate of divorce is slightly over half the rate of marriage](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/marriage_divorce_tables.htm) also the [rate of birth to unmarried mother is 40.7% (2011) of all births in the US]( http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr61/nvsr61_05.pdf) (table 7).  

Now a few givens, some of the laws created for marriage licensing were made because of race, particularly in the southern US.   However marriage licenses were also a way for the state to track beneficiaries in the case of death; or who can lay claim to property etc.  

So my question is this:

Do you agree that we, as a society, have outgrown marriage laws?  If we have how should they be dealt with?  Do you think they are necessary at all?  If we get rid of them how do you feel benefits and other items should be dealt with? If anyone has stats for the EU/AUS/etc.. I would be happy to hear that as well.

There was an understanding that a family would retain its cultural identity within the house or a tight-knit community, but in the wider social and working world, it was important to fit in. [Assimilation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_assimilation#Assimilation_of_immigrants_in_the_United_States) was not a dirty word. 

But around the end of World War II, assimilation became associated with racist oppression and a strong movement took hold to make societies more accepting. By the 1960s, mass immigration and civil rights movements had given Western governments the momentum needed to adopt overt policies of multiculturalism, many of which have been strengthened in the last couple decades.

For the purposes of this discussion, ""multiculturalism"" is defined by the [programmatic-political usage:](http://www.unesco.org/most/pp4.htm#clarification) *specific types of programs and policy initiatives designed to respond to and manage ethnic diversity.* Multiculturalism in this context is not the same as diversity, but rather a *response* to diversity — [""a particular approach to dealing with the challenges of cultural diversity and, in particular, to bringing about the advancement of marginalised or disadvantaged groups.""](http://www.politicscymru.com/en/cat6/article8/)

[Multicultural policies go ""beyond the non-discriminatory protection of traditional individual rights of citizenship [in Western liberal-democracies] [...to] also provide some additional form of public recognition, support or accommodation for ethnocultural minorities to maintain and express their distinct identities and practices.](http://www.queensu.ca/mcp/about/definitionsdata.html)

Some [examples of such policies](http://www.queensu.ca/mcp/immigrant/evidence/ImmigrantMinoritiesApr12.pdf) are:

* Bilingual or mother-tongue education.
* Shifting education curricula to recognize and appreciate more cultures.
* Supporting minority languages in official documents and signage.
* Direct government funding to support specific ethnic groups.
* [Affirmative action](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/affirmative%20action) programs to increase student and workplace diversity.
* Including ethnic representation, sensitivity or diversity in the mandate of public broadcasters or media licensing.
* Granting exemptions or accommodations to dress codes on religious grounds.

**Compelling arguments have been made that [multiculturalism is actually a *hindrance* to diversity](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2010/mar/17/multiculturalism-diversity-political-policy) and that it [encourages extremism](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/david-cameron/8305346/Muslims-must-embrace-our-British-values-David-Cameron-says.html). That's the thrust of my question here. Is multiculturalism working or is it a failed experiment?**

Those who argue against multiculturalism are often denounced as [racists](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-16968930), or even worse, associated with [xenophobia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anders_Behring_Breivik) or [neo-Nazism](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/greeces-neofascists-are-on-the-rise-and-now-theyre-going-into-schools-how-golden-dawn-is-nurturing-the-next-generation-8477997.html). There are certainly those elements. But there's also a less-radical, evidence-based movement that supports a rethinking of the concept based on what are viewed as the failures of multiculturalism. An opposition to multiculturalism does not imply rounding up and deporting all the immigrants. It implies finding a better way to achieve harmony, happiness and advancement for all.

So, to pose some final discussion questions: Is multiculturalism all it's cracked up to be? Can a society that responds to diversity by subdividing itself truly be seen to be advancing? Do policies of multiculturalism lead to the greater good for the most people? In diverse societies that don't espouse multiculturalism, but instead respond to cultural diversity by encouraging a degree of assimilation, are minority groups more oppressed, downtrodden, discounted or under-represented?

I would appreciate feedback, suggestions, or whatever.  For instance, I suspect there are better podcasts for the socialist/marxist category, but I don't what they might be.  Also, I'm certain there are more categories I could add, but which ones? And I don't want the list to grow too long, so that's a concern too.  I'm thinking an absolute maximum of 30, but I'd prefer to keep it closer to 15 and merely change out existing podcasts for higher quality ones.  One final note - for the most part, I've tried to select podcasts that are hour-ish long interviews with academic/intellectual types - I'd prefer to keep it that way.  There's nothing wrong with call-in live shows, per se. I just hate them, and they suck.  However, I'll give anything a listen once.

***

Today, the National Transportation Safety Board voted to recommend that states should lower their drunk-driving threshold from 0.08 to 0.05 BAC. The closest thing I can find to an official announcement comes via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/NTSB/status/334337179721531392).

I'm always interested to hear the pros and cons of initiatives like this. According to the [NTSB website](http://www.ntsb.gov/news/events/2013/eliminate_impaired_driving/faq.html), some of the pros are as follows:

* Fatal crashes decreased 18 percent in Queensland and 8 percent in New South Wales after those Australian states lowered their per se BAC limits from 0.08 to 0.05. 

* A study of per se BAC reductions in several European countries found that the change from a 0.08 to a 0.05 per se BAC limit reduced traffic deaths by 8-12 percent among people aged 18-49. 

* Regarding crash risk, one study found that the risk of fatal crash involvement at BACs between 0.050 and 0.079 ranged from 3 to 17 times greater, depending on the age of the driver and fatal crash. Another study found that at a BAC of 0.05, drivers are 38 percent more likely to be in a crash than are sober drivers. 

* Although lowering the per se BAC threshold may seem counterintuitive when the majority of alcohol-impaired drivers in fatal crashes have BAC levels well over 0.08, research on the effectiveness of laws limiting BAC levels has found that lowering the per se BAC limit changes the drink-driving behavior of drivers at all BAC levels.

The NTSB website also links to a [policy statement](http://www.aaam.org/BAC.pdf) from the Association for the Advancement of Automotive Medicine, which summarizes a number of different studies showing a relationship between lower BAC limits and fewer drunk-driving accidents (all of the studies are referenced at the end of the statement).

**Mission statement**
 
We're building an environment where political ideas can be exchanged in a safe, smart and neutral way. This is a community where evidence and 
open-mindedness are valued above all. In /r/NeutralPolitics, we try to learn about opposing positions and see their merits, possibly even changing our opinions in the process. Posts and comments that are not sufficiently open-minded or backed by evidence will be removed.

-----

**Submission guidelines**

/r/NeutralPolitics only allows self (text) posts, although we *strongly* encourage you to link to reliable sources within those posts. This format requires OPs to explain the topic well and stand on their own assertions, while also removing karma as a motivation.

These components make a good post:

1. Asks a specific question
2. Outlines the issue well
3. Links to a qualified source or sources
4. Proposes a starting point for discussion
5. Identifies potential flaws in the arguments presented
6. Contains an accurate title

If you don't have a specific source, but want to start a discussion about a broad issue, make sure you lay it out clearly and ask specific questions, as was done [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/11m6mp/regarding_economic_policies_how_can_a_layman/) and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/15sfd7/what_are_some_ways_that_the_united_states_could/).

If your source is an opinion article, the article itself needs to be well referenced and your post must clearly state that its source is an editorial.

Speculative posts or requests for prognostication are held to an especially high standard. Since there's no way to provide supporting evidence for answers to ""What would happen if..."" types of questions, they don't usually generate the kind of dialog we're looking for. If you're going to make a speculative post, please be extra careful to adhere to all the other guidelines.

These kinds of posts will get removed:

* *Inflammatory.* ""Labour Party is idiotic!""
* *Editorializing.* ""Senator Josephs proposes the worst immigration plan in history.""
* *Overly broad.* Extremely broad posts don't usually generate useful discussion. However, if properly framed, they can occasionally be useful from an educational standpoint, so they won't automatically be removed. For example, a post without references that simply requests, ""Please explain the Federal Reserve,"" doesn't sufficiently outline the issue. However, a post that properly frames the broad question, ""What are the advantages and disadvantages of a country having a central bank, such as the US Federal Reserve?"" would probably stand, depending on which sources it referred to.
* *""Taking the temperature"" style questions*, such as asking, ""What does NP think about x policy?"" without elaborating any further.
* *""Survey"" style questions* that inherently cannot have a definitive answer, such as, ""Who are the most trustworthy politicians?""
* *Misleading title.*
* *Based on bad sources.* Posts referencing poor, inaccurate, inflammatory or extremely biased source material.
* *Bad starting point for discussion.* Any post that's unlikely to generate useful, civil debate. This is the overarching theme of this subreddit and the most common reason that articles get removed. If mods believe that a post may cause or is causing discussion to spiral into the kind of baseless, tit-for-tat talking points that pass for debate in other political forums, the post and all comments will be removed.


Source quality:

* The preferred sources are academic articles from neutral organizations.
* Wikipedia should not be cited by an OP as the primary or solitary source. You can cite Wikipedia, but it can't be the only thing there.
* If your source is a news article, the publication should not be overly biased.
* Opinion pieces are tricky. Generally speaking, they don't generate useful discussion, but there are times when a well-referenced, unbiased exploration of an issue gets published as an opinion piece and does provide a good starting point. If your opinion piece itself doesn't provide sources, forget about posting it. 
* If your source is a book, link to a good summary or extensive review.
* No hearsay. The article must either contain a direct quote or a link to a direct quote that substantiates the position being attributed to the speaker. So, you can't call someone an anarchist unless you cite a quote where he calls himself an anarchist. (Thanks to /u/insomniaclyric for [proposing](http://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/17z8tj/meta_guidelines_for_source_quality_and_neutrality/c8afdsc) this rule.)

We do not maintain a ""blacklist"" of sources, because experience has shown that good articles occasionally show up in unlikely places. However, it is the responsibility of the poster or commenter to know the source's reputation and use extra care if quoting from a publication that's widely considered to be biased. It helps to point out that bias in your post too.

-----

**Comments:**

Quality discussion in the comments on /r/NeutralPolitics is the core of our goal for this sub. The rules in the sidebar perfectly encapsulate the guidelines for commenting:

* 1. Be nice- Please do not demean others or flame. Be constructive in your criticism. 
* 2. Be bold- Please state your opinion honestly and freely. However, respect the need for factual evidence and good logic when you post an opinion. 
* 3. Be neutral- Leave your assumptions at the door. Be open-minded to others. 

One of the most common reasons that comments get removed is because they make assertions without a source. An opinion has some wiggle room, but if you're going to phrase a comment as a statement of fact, you need to back it up with a link to a reliable source.

The following characteristics will also get a comment removed:

* *Name-calling.* If you can't counter someone's argument without calling them ""stupid"" or some such thing, then find another place to argue.
* *Off-topic.* Try to stay focused.
* *Memes, gifs, ""upvote,"" etc.* No. Just no.

-----

**Voting &amp; Reporting**

Do **not** downvote a post or comment just because you disagree. A downvote on NeutralPolitics means the post or comment does not meet the sub's guidelines. Think of it this way... if you're downvoting a comment, there's a decent chance you should be reporting it too. Similarly, do not *upvote* a post or comment simply because you *agree* with it.

The [Guide to Downvoting and Upvoting](http://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/ptgxf/meta_rneutralpolitics_guide_to_downvoting_and/) does a thorough job of explaining all this in more detail.

The mods strongly encourage reporting. If you feel an article or comment does not meet these guidelines, please help decrease our workload by reporting it.

-----

**Moderation**

This sub practices heavy moderation. Be prepared for the possibility that your post or comment will be removed. Whenever possible, mods will attempt to explain their decision to OP.

Your post or comment will NOT be removed because a mod disagrees with you or wants to censor opinion. If that's what you think has happened, it is suggested that you first examine your own neutrality on the issue at hand, and if you find it's adequate, send modmail explaining why you don't think your contribution should have been deleted.

The goal of /r/NeutralPolitics is to maintain quality, empirical discussion. Towards that end, mods will sometimes participate in discussions to keep them on track or enforce the rules.

The mods reserve the right to ban users who habitually violate the rules or standards of decorum. 

If you participate in other political discussion forums, on reddit or elsewhere, ours may be a little uncomfortable for you at first. The tone and standards we set here are purposefully different. We require more effort than it takes to simply post an opinion off the cuff.

-----

**Our ""culture""**

The original [FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/pteu5/meta_rneutralpolitics_frequently_asked_questions/) calls /r/NeutralPolitics ""a constructive environment for political discourse[...] where those of differing opinions can come together and rationally lay out respective arguments. We are neutral in that no political opinion is favored here - only facts and logic."" We still hold to this ideal.

These folks get it:

/u/biskino: ""We're not deciding issues here - we're talking about them (and talking about how others are talking about them).""

/u/young_d: ""What I want from this sub, and what is often delivered here, is evidence based politics.""

/u/Monkeyfusion: ""...its a forum where we can really talk about issues and hash out what the best solution might be, or what the truth of the matter is...""

/u/HeartyBeast provides this quote from Russell's *History of Western Philosophy*:

&gt;""When an intelligent man expresses a view which seems to us obviously absurd, we should not attempt to prove that it is somehow true, but we should try to understand how it ever came to seem true. 
&gt;
&gt;This exercise of historical and psychological imagination at once enlarges the scope of our thinking, and helps us to realize how foolish many of our own cherished prejudices will seem to an age which has a different temper of mind.""

The consensus of the community is that [neutral is not the same as moderate](http://redd.it/15d8fc), and users have made [specific requests that mods enforce that distinction](http://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/16ngup/ive_hijacked_the_comments_on_another_post_to/c7xvpsb).

-----

**Feedback**

The mods appreciate feedback on anything related to how /r/NeutralPolitics is run. This sub is a work in progress. We're trying to create something different here, and suggestions from subscribers have already guided our direction significantly. If you have something to contribute, don't hesitate to send [modmail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FNeutralPolitics). Similarly, complaints about moderation will receive a fair hearing.

The original comment was posted [in this thread.](http://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/17r1ss/do_we_live_in_a_posttruth_era/)

I recently read [The Filter Bubble](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/12/books/review/book-review-the-filter-bubble-by-eli-pariser.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0) and I've been dwelling on the impact that this structure could have on our access to facts (read: ""truth"") as well as their context and how we interpret them.

Quick background on what the ""filter bubble"" is: in 2009, Google and Facebook (most notably - there are others, including AOL, ABC News, and Amazon) began customizing our search results, news feeds, and generally ""tailoring"" the sites and affiliates to the users preferences (this is why you see certain G-mail notes auto-marked as important, for example, and why certain people always show up on your Facebook news feed).

This is all well and good - it saves us from looking for what we are most interested in. However, it also filters out what we are not interested in...which could be opposing religious or political views, world events, etc. and thusly creates a ""bubble"" effect in which basically creates an automated confirmation bias - the things you agree with are reinforced, and the things that are deemed unimportant simply don't show up.

Author [Eli Parsier, a libertarian known for helping found political organization MoveOn.org](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eli_Pariser) writes, “personalization filters serve up a kind of invisible autopropaganda, indoctrinating us with our own ideas, amplifying our desire for things that are familiar."" His concern is that we have massive companies (Google, Facebook) that we use as news and political sources that are compounding incorrect or incorrectly interpreted data. Additionally, we may be missing information all together. The personalization goes so far as to which sentence structures you prefer (again, note the G-mail example for which are marked important if from a new sender) - which is structures similar to your own (you are more likely to listen to a source like yourself). This tightens the filter bubble effect even more.

So, my question in all this is, how do we get truth and/or balanced views when where we go for news and information is tailored to give us the answers we are looking for? How much more actively do we have to look for unbiased information? My additional concern is how few people know about the filter bubble effect and how active personalization is in our online media - as in, most people don't know that their feeds are as closed off as they are.


**EDIT:** When I wrote this, I meant more of a universal ""how do we find truth,"" not so much looking for advice. My concern is with the general population that a) is unaware of the filter bubble and/or b) the extent that the filter bubble actually influences what information reaches them, or doesn't *without their knowledge of the change*. 


**Suggestions for minimalizing or eliminating the filter bubble effect on a personal scale:**

- Alternating browsers

- Incognito, safe browsing, or ""opting out"" of giving information (GPS or otherwise)

- Using search engines that don't use your information (such as DuckDuckGo.com)

- Updating personal info for multiple locations (i/e: New York as well as San Fransisco) to soften regional news

- Using multiple news sources *(Fortunately most of us here in r/NeutralPolitics already prefer this!)*

People like us might be more inclined to say, ""There's more to that, that seemed biased"" and get more info, but not everyone does that. I'm especially interested in discussing how this may or may not effect political discussions in the future, which are already so biased to begin with (and people are more susceptible to confirmation bias/less likely to seek outside sources).

On the other hand, seeing what posts are getting up- or down-voted could help to push discussion forward on some threads, though I don't see that as a particularly common or useful trend.

After more than half a century of technological advance, we are ready to launch it within two decades. However, for some reason, the amount of investments in this field is much smaller than that in wind or solar energy.

[Nuclear fusion](http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2012/sep/16/nuclear-fusion-iter-jet-forshaw) is the process of colliding and joining nuclei together. If those nuclei are lighter than the atom of iron, this process generates additional energy. The fusion of hydrogen atoms to helium atoms [powers the wast majority of stars](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/nucene/fusion.html). On the Earth, scientists are working on a slightly different type of fusion between deuterium and tritium. It is much easier to achieve, ans slightly less powerful, but the amount of power it generates [is still tremendous](http://physics.ucsd.edu/do-the-math/2012/01/nuclear-fusion/):

&gt;On a per mass, or per nucleon basis, fusion wins hands-down: one gram of deuterium results in 10^12 J of energy, or 275 million kcal. Fission gives a comparatively small 20 million kcal per gram of ^235 U. So fusion is over ten times as potent. Keep in mind that chemical energy like that in fossil fuels is capped around 10 kcal/g. Note the conspicuous absence of the word million. On the energy scale, then, nuclear in either form is outrageously more potent than chemical energy.

We can compare those 10^12 J per one gram of fuel to other forms of green energy. [The best of the best of solar cells](http://apl.aip.org/resource/1/applab/v95/i22/p223503_s1?isAuthorized=no) generates about 2 kW/kg. That means that one kilogram of those cells needs to operate for (1 (kilogram) x 10^12 J / 2 (kW/kg)) / (3600 (seconds per hour) x 12 (sunny hours a day) x 365.25 (days per year) = 317 years under ideal conditions to produce the same amount of energy, which one gram of deuterium does. The whole [North Hoyle Offshore Wind Farm](http://www.wind-power-program.com/large_turbines.htm), which [covers an area of 10 square kilometers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Hoyle_Offshore_Wind_Farm) and consists of 30 turbines, produces 190752 mWh of energy annually. That means, that the whole wind farm needs to operate for (10^12 J / (190752 (mWh) x 1000000 x 3600)) x 365.25 = 5 days to produce the energy of one gram of deuterium. Geothermal [Hellisheiði Power Station](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellisheiði_Power_Station) produces 303 MW of electricity: (10^12 J / (303 MW x 1000000)) / 3600 = 9 hours of operation to compete with one gram of deuterium. 

The process of fusion itself is relatively easy to perform, and the only problem is to make it efficient enough for the industrial application. The project [ITER](http://www.iter.org/faq) is aimed to achieve that by the year 2027. The technology they use is called [tokamak](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokamak) and uses magnetic fields to heat the fuel and hold it in place. The reaction there is not self-sustaining, it solely relies on an external power source, so in case of any catastrophic failure it would just shut down, and not explode under any conditions (self-sustaining reaction is theoretically possible, and occurs in the cores of stars. However, it's impossible to achieve in the near future. Moreover, in the worst case scenario, only [0.1 gram of deuterium is in the reaction chamber](http://www.efda.org/faq/new-what-is-the-temperature-generated-in-a-tokamak-reactor-how-can-the-inner-wall-material-resist-that-temperature/). That won't make any significant explosion, and stockpiles will never explode for the exact same reason why it's hard to build a hydrogen bomb: you need a nuclear explosion inside a small shell to ignite the reaction of fusion). Deuterium-only reactors won't require any radioactive fuel at all. Early reactors will require radioactive tritium, but in minuscule amounts: only [3 Kg for ITER](http://www.fusion.ucla.edu/ITER-TBM/ITER-TBM2/Tritium%20Supply%20Considerations.ppt), for example. They only waste those reactors produce is a noble gas helium, which is used in industry, occur in the atmosphere already and doesn't react with anything.

Finally, developing fusion reactors will open the way for manned exploration of the Solar System (e.g. [ferry astronauts to Mars and back in just 30 days](http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2417551,00.asp)) and [mining more nuclear fuel on the Moon](http://ares.jsc.nasa.gov/humanexplore/exploration/exlibrary/docs/isru/06energy.htm).

In other words, on all the aspects nuclear fusion leaves far behind not only fossil fuels, but also modern nuclear fission, wind energy, solar energy, geothermal energy and others. It will be available not eventually, but within 20 years. Still, the world have only two major nuclear fusion facilities: ITER in Europe, [whose cost is](http://www.iter.org/factsfigures) 13 billion euros = $17 billion, and National Ignition Facility is the US, [whose budget is](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Ignition_Facility) $3 billion. At the same time, [only in the year 2011](http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/industries/energy/story/2012-06-11/Renewable-energy-investment/55517876/1) the world have invested $147 billion in solar energy and $84 billion in wind energy.

[Prop 8 ruling.](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-144_8ok0.pdf)

[DOMA ruling.](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-307_g2bh.pdf)

I've been listening to talk radio on the way to work trying to figure out what the decisions were, why they were made and what effect they will have.

From what I can tell:

[DOMA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_of_Marriage_Act) was declared unconstitutional, in that it discriminated between Americans under federal law for federal benefits.  Basically, because of this ruling, the federal government must recognize legal same sex marriages from states when dealing with federal benefits.

As far as [Prop 8](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Proposition_8) is concerned, the talk is that SCOTUS ""punted"" and basically said that the defendants of Prop 8 had no standing, which means it was sent back to the trial court and will maintain that court's finding.  Because it is a trial court it will set no precedent, and will have no bearing on other states.  BUT, gay marriage will be allowed to proceed in California.

So are my summaries correct? 

What will be the results from these decisions by SCOTUS?  

Specifically, I'm curious about something I heard on the radio this morning.  That due to this ruling on Prop 8, in the future voters who have enacted a proposition through majority vote will not have a standing to defend that law if the government of California will not enforce it?

Interested to hear all opinions...

Edit: Will also change the text of this post as it is corrected (if it is corrected.)

**Bonus Question worth 50 points:** If anyone happens to have facts that might answer these questions:  Did the black vote (brought out by Obama in the election) help Prop 8 get passed in California?  Is there any truth to the claim that a majority of Black Americans do not view the gay rights struggle as a ""civil rights struggle"" and are therefore turned off to it?

**DOUBLE WHAMMY BONUS EDIT**:  I truly did not mean to offend anyone with the bonus question.  As a Californian, I have heard both claims that **A)** the increase in Black voters in California (who were out to support Obama) helped Prop 8 pass and **B)** that Black Americans do not view the gay rights issue as a civil rights issue.

In response to [HighPlainsDrifter](http://vimeo.com/2508560) (one of my favorite bouldering problems, btw) I posted this:

-

&gt; Well, I guess I would offer up the following:

&gt; Thanks to ObviousCommentor above: [70% of Black people voted YES on Prop 8](http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2008/11/70-of-african-a.html)

&gt; Then: [2008 surge in Black Voters](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/21/us/politics/21vote.html?_r=0)

&gt; Also:  [Blacks and Religion](http://www.pewforum.org/A-Religious-Portrait-of-African-Americans.aspx)

&gt; I'm sure with such information we could make a claim about whether Black voters helped prop 8 pass.

&gt; As far as the other question goes... I wouldn't mind hearing from a Black Californian on the matter of whether he/she might view gay rights in the same light as civil rights.  

&gt; But it isn't like there aren't [numbers](http://cnsnews.com/news/article/poll-55-blacks-say-gay-rights-not-same-civil-rights) out there to help us guide our opinion.  

I didn't mean to create a ""biased, loaded question.""  It is something I've heard talked about and wanted an open discussion.  You seem to think it is impossible to have one.

Everyone seems to be saying that things wouldn't have gone down like it did if Martin or Zimmerman were of a different race. I really don't see how that's true given the facts of the case. Can anyone respond to me and explain why they believe differently?](http://libertyandrespect.tumblr.com/post/55461163964/on-george-zimmerman-and-race-in-america)

&gt; The New York Times had an article today featuring many reactions from the African American community. The general consensus displayed in the article is that if Martin were white this wouldn’t have happened and that if Zimmerman were black he would have been arrested quicker and may have been convicted. What we’re seeing is a clear view that this trial was about race and that it is emblematic of race issues in America.

&gt; I’m a white male, and it’s hard to talk about race or gender issues as one. I’m frequently told I simply can’t understand these issues because I’ll never share the same perspective. The new buzz word is “privilege,"" and the idea is that by the nature of being a white male I’m blinded to what I don’t personally experience. I think this is wildly unfair.* Granted I may not experience many race and gender issues personally, but to imply, nay outright state, that I can’t objectively look at facts and empathize with others who don’t look like I do is offensive to me. An inherent racism and sexism is presumed to exist within me simply because of my color and gender. I think those who espouse this idea are more racist and sexist than I.

&gt; From this perspective, I think we need to look at the facts of this case. There is simply no evidence that race played a factor in this shooting. The statements made about race in relation to this case take a perception of prejudice in our nation and push it onto Zimmerman. Many have said that Zimmerman was suspicious of Martin because he was black, but Zimmerman’s claim is that Martin was walking abnormally slowly for someone in the rain, was looking into people’s homes, and was hiding his face with a hoodie. Considering that there had been multiple break-ins in their neighborhood and that Zimmerman was on duty as neighborhood watch to help prevent more, doesn’t Martin sound suspicious enough without needing to bring race into the mix? This isn’t to say Martin was guilty of anything, and it seems clear that he was not, but simply that if anyone else was in Zimmerman’s position they would have been suspicious as well. It’s said that if Zimmerman were black he would have been arrested on the spot, but isn’t it more likely that the reason he wasn’t arrested was because he was already on the phone with the police explaining the situation before the fight even broke out and because as far as the police knew he was correctly following the state’s self-defense laws? We should also look at Zimmerman’s character. Zimmerman was raised in a multi-ethnic family and has black relatives. No witnesses provided any reason to believe that Zimmerman had a past of any racism. We now know that the tape NBC played when this case was still fresh was edited and that Zimmerman did not say what Martin’s race was until asked.

&gt; Despite all this Zimmerman is presumed to be a racist by so many people discussing this case. They’ve taken their view of how society works and they’re so sure of it that they seem to know Zimmerman must behave in tune. To think any other way is considered by them to be naive. Besides how this has already ruined George Zimmerman’s life, I think this way of looking at the world is extremely detrimental to the nation as a whole. The fact is that real racism still exists. The KKK and other extremist groups are small, but still out there. Arrest rates are far higher for African Americans than white Americans. Particularly damaging is drug arrests, where 3.73 times as many African Americans are arrested for possession of marijuana despite usage rates only being 2% higher among blacks. This sort of real racism is devalued when anything and everything is described as being racist. If you’re against affirmative action: racist. If you agree Zimmerman was not guilty: racist. The same thing happens with sexism and anti-semitism. You’re pro-life: sexist. You’re against the state of Israel: anti-semite. For those terms too there is real sexism and anti-semitism out there, but it’s devalued when it’s used to cast broad and unevidenced aspersions.

&gt; Racism is still a problem in society, but it’s not the problem it was 40 years ago and the rhetoric needs to change with it. It has become difficult for me to take people who cry racism seriously any more. It has gotten to the point where I have to study each individual accusation individually in order to believe it as recently I’ve seen racism more frequently screamed where it isn’t than where it is.",,False,,t5_2tk0i,False,,,True,t3_1ib14h,http://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/1ib14h/what_does_the_reaction_to_zimmermans_acquittal/,

However, I do not think we've got it quite right yet. And the system has potentially not been tested properly yet.

The West 'decided' it was the best system and decided that anyone who still uses a dictatorial system, which is just another form of governance (albeit with lower instances of rights and potentially inevitable tyrannical dangers), was worthy of being killed like a dog by the nations people. Many deem this to be completely just.

It is possible that the best way of governing would be through a benevolent and omnipresent dictator, someone who has the power to get things done and always acts in the best interests of the people; but this is impossible. Power corrupts, people are biased and at times malicious, and no one person or centralised power base can have the oversight to see to a whole nations issues.

The supposed success of democracy has come from its correlation with successful states and their supposedly lower instance of human rights abuses within its borders. However many of these nations have also historically been very oppressive outside their borders with a huge amount of dominance and violence in less developed -  or powerful, should i say - countries, which has contributed hugely to their successes. Could it be that it has worked so well only in partnership with economic affluence?

It could be argued that many of these strong democratic nations are only really being tested now in a time of economic hardship in which it is much less acceptable to meddle in foreign nations' resources and affairs, and even so they still display a great deal of external force and dominance (such as the West's questionable war on terror, or even trade treaties that ensure some level of advantage is kept).

The real danger in democracy is essentially the tyranny of the majority. This is something that will only become more and more of a risk as times get harder, conflicts more extreme and divisions deeper. And it is for this reason as well, that I wonder whether maybe we should not so explicitly push democracy on countries with such unstable conditions and deep, often ethnic divisions between people. 

So what do you think? Does the democratic system need safeguards? If so what are they? Or, are there other approaches altogether or is a new one needed?

EDIT
I would like to make my case more specific.

I think I would be wary that possibly a system that ensures representation of different groups could be beneficial to some extent. What I am trying to get at is that I fear tyranny of the majority being a bigger danger somewhere where there are unstable conditions combined with deep divides such as ethnic tension. 

An example of this would be in the case of Iraq with its Sunni and Shi'ite populations, where ethnic identity is strong but also tensions are high, and where a system of democracy has now been established in the hope that it will be an improvement for all. My fear would be that a democracy could fail to protect the smaller population of people from the tyranny of the other. So I wonder if in cases like this if safeguards could be established that ensure a strong voice of the weak.

How this relates to the testing of democracy is that in many successful democratic nations, these divides between people have possibly not been so clear or strong. What is being seen now in these harder times is that they may be developing as people look for an easy cause of their troubles. In the EU there is a clear and worrying resurfacing of nationalism. We must remember that Hitler and the Nazis were in fact democratically elected. This could be touted as a sign that the democratic system is not always beneficial to citizens, especially so in unstable conditions.",,False,,t5_2tk0i,1364011749.0,,,True,t3_1au6av,http://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/1au6av/is_democracy_really_the_best_system_of_governance/,

A pet-peeve of mine has been that most of them seem to be REALLY biased.   Anyway, I decided to make my own.

[Here](http://i.imgur.com/fUk3wtt.png) is the political compass.  I tried to phrase the parameters in such a way as to avoid the appearance of implicitly endorsing any particular set of beliefs (e.g. ""license"" instead of ""liberty"" or ""libertarianism"").


[Here](http://i.imgur.com/dOzFuLG.png) is a basic explanation, with some examples of where I believe certain ideologies should fall.  Keep in mind that the traditional ""left/right"" dichotomy was ignored, which is why you'll see certain political ideologies in what, at first glance, may appear to be the wrong side of the divide.

Various quadrants, rows and columns could be termed as different ideologies/systems/etc.  For example, B and D would be ""capitalism"", while B2, B4, C3, C4, D2, D3, and D4 would be the entirety of (both ""right"" and ""left"") ""libertarianism"".

Anyway, I would like to know what you all think of it and any suggestions you might have for improvement.

EDIT: apparently a few anarcho-communists got pissed because, to explain how the chart worked, I highlighted the fact that their ideology involved extreme economic constraint.  Now they're here to flood my inbox and tell me that banning private property will really free us from the oppression of capitalism.  I posted here specifically to avoid an ideology-fueled shitstorm like that, but I guess you can't escape that sort of thing in any political subreddit...even those championing neutrality.  Anyway, I think I'm just going to ignore my inbox for the next day or so until this dies down.

After this, and some other incidents here, I think I'm going to unsubscribe.  There are some really awesome people here...but for some reason this sub seems to have become a magnet for extremists, and those are exactly the sort of people I try to avoid on Reddit.

However, if you have a general knowledge of the Employer Mandate and that it was suspended a couple of weeks ago, you can skip past the BACKGROUND section.  If you are familiar specifically with the debate over whether suspending the mandate was legal, you can also skip the LEGAL IMPLICATIONS section.*

**BACKGROUND**

On July 2, 2013, Assistant Secretary of the Treasury Mark Mazur [announced]( http://www.treasury.gov/connect/blog/Pages/Continuing-to-Implement-the-ACA-in-a-Careful-Thoughtful-Manner-.aspx) that the Treasury Department is suspending two related provisions of the Affordable Care Act (popularly known as “Obamacare”) for a period of one year.  (Chief-of-Staff Valerie Jarrett elaborated slightly in a [post](http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2013/07/02/we-re-listening-businesses-about-health-care-law) that same day.)

The first suspended provision, Section [6055](http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/6055)/[6056](http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/6056), requires employers and insurance providers to periodically report health insurance coverage information to the Treasury Department.  It is being suspended in order to allow more time to “consider ways to simplify the new reporting requirements” and for employers to “adapt health coverage and reporting systems.”  This is [reportedly]( https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CC8QFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fonline.wsj.com%2Farticle%2FSB10001424127887324436104578582082787214660.html&amp;ei=e8ruUfu1JMXKyQHK2IGoDw&amp;usg=AFQjCNElVbACSEyDwyHZyqW5gAoWK497CA&amp;sig2=3FepiVYO2sanQ1fvhnHOjw&amp;bvm=bv.49641647,d.aWc) legalese for “we’re not ready with the regulations, and you’re not ready with the reporting technology, so let’s try again next year.”  

The second suspended provision, [4980H](http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/4980H), generally known as the “Employer Mandate” or “Shared Responsibility Payment,” requires all large employers (defined by the ACA as, basically, anyone with 50 or more employees) to either provide Obamacare-compliant “minimal health insurance” to all full-time and some part-time employees or suffer substantial penalties (which were clarified as a tax penalty by the Supreme Court last year).  The reason given for the Mandate’s suspension was simply that suspending the reporting requirements would render enforcement of the Employer Mandate somewhat impractical.  Some Republicans have [suggested](http://thehill.com/blogs/twitter-room/other-news/309199-sen-graham-obama-delaying-employer-mandate-because-of-2014-election-concerns-) that the real motivation is to protect the Democrats during the midterm elections.

However, this post is ***not*** about the motivations behind the suspensions, nor about the political and practical fallout.  Those topics are [discussed](http://meganmcardle.com/2013/07/11/the-employer-mandate-a-necessary-impossibility/) at considerable length [elsewhere]( http://theweek.com/article/index/246902/obamacare-relies-on-the-honor-system-will-americans-cheat#), and I wanna Keep It Neutral in here.  This post is concerned strictly with the legality of the Administration’s suspension actions.

**LEGAL IMPLICATIONS**

The suspension of the reporting requirements is probably kosher, legally speaking.  The ACA explicitly gives the Secretary of the Treasury vast discretion over when and how these reporting requirements are to be implemented.  (Just read both sections and highlight all the sentences that include the phrase “as the Secretary may prescribe” or “as the Secretary may require”.)  Therefore, although it was certainly not directly intended by the legislators who crafted the law, and even though the [ACA itself]( http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-111hr3590enr/pdf/BILLS-111hr3590enr.pdf) states (at Section 1514(d)) that the reporting requirements come into effect on January 1st, 2014, it is absolutely within the Secretary’s ambit to announce, “Yeah, sure, this technically comes into effect in 2014, but we’ve decided that the first due date for this section is May 1, 2015.  See you then.”  This legal evasion of a law’s official start date is almost routine procedure in Washington, especially when a piece of legislation turns out to be much broader than anticipated and needs a lot more rulemaking than Congress planned for.  In fact, it is a fairly regular occurrence for the Executive branch to simply miss rulemaking deadlines that are set by statute, even though they have no legal authority to miss said deadlines.  That’s unfortunate, but it’s not criminal so long as the Executive was making a good-faith effort to complete the rulemaking on time.  Heck, sometimes Congress sets impossible deadlines; the Executive does its best.

To be sure, there are still questions about the legality of suspending the reporting requirements.  Namely, while the Secretary may indefinitely delay the *due date* for the reporting, it seems that he may *not* suspend the reporting requirement itself, so, on whatever due date is eventually picked, employers will have to submit reporting for the *entire* period from 1 January 2014 up until that date.  From the Treasury announcement (and subsequent IRS guidance), it’s not clear that that’s their understanding of the law.  But, for all that, on my reading, there’s no *obvious* violation of the law in the decision to suspend the employer reporting requirements.

However, the suspension of the Employer Mandate itself appears, at face value, to be quite illegal.  The ACA contains a mandatory “effective date” requirement at Section 1513(d), which reads, “The amendments made by this section shall apply to months beginning after December 31, 2013.”  This is less ambiguous than Section 1514(d) (which uses “periods” instead of “months”).  More importantly, the Secretary of the Treasury is simply *not* empowered to waive these requirements or the resultant penalties.  The statute gives him a lot of power to do that with reporting requirements, but not with the taxes themselves.  Now, Treasury may delay *collection* of the required penalties (§4980H(d)(1)), but the “assessable payment” itself is imposed directly by Congress on employers (§4980H(a)), is effective January 2014 (§1514(d)), with specific dollar-amount penalties imposed for specifically 2014 (§4980H(c)(1) and §4980H(c)(5)) which may be suspended *only* in conjunction with a much broader state-specific “innovation waiver” as described under §1332.

In short, the Affordable Care Act – currently the law of the land – says that this new tax penalty goes into effect in January 2014, and, *apparently*, the Department of the Treasury is, independently of Congress and the Constitution, *cancelling* that tax penalty for Tax Year 2014.  Right-wingers like [Michael McConnell]( http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323823004578591503509555268.html) and [Michael Cannon](http://www.cato.org/blog/yes-delaying-obamacares-employer-mandate-illegal) are not alone in considering this action illegal; some on the Left, like Sen. [Tom Harkin]( http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/10/us/politics/house-gop-pushes-delay-on-individual-mandate-in-health-law.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0), and [Jonathan Chait]( http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2013/07/obama-employer-mandate-delay-train-wreck-or-not.html), as well as some in the Center, like legendary constitutional lawyer [Ronald Rotunda]( http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/on-the-health-care-mandate-obama-reaches-beyond-the-law/2013/07/18/d442aefc-efb4-11e2-a1f9-ea873b7e0424_story.html), all seem to agree that this isn’t legal, and no prominent voices on the Left are speaking up to defend the action as lawful.

**OBAMA’S DEFENSE**

Two weeks after Obama Administration suspended the Employer Mandate, J. Mark Iwry, a senior Treasury Advisor, presented, for the first time, the Administration’s legal justification for this action in his [testimony]( http://waysandmeans.house.gov/uploadedfiles/hl8_071713_iwry_testimony_final_.pdf) to the House Ways and Means Committee.  He argued that this is a routine exercise of Treasury’s authority under [§7805(a)](http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/7805), which grants the Secretary of the Treasury broad authority to make rules and regulations in order to enforce the Internal Revenue Code (which includes these penalties).  But the obvious rebuttal is that this suspension action (and the rules associated with it) don’t *enforce* the Internal Revenue Code, but specifically and directly *prevent* enforcement.  

Mr. Iwry cited half a dozen instances during the Clinton and Bush Administrations where, he argued, Section 7805(a) had been used to effect similar delays and suspensions, and if it was okay then, why shouldn’t it be okay now?  This is perhaps not the strongest defense that can be imagined – “Bush did it first” does not exactly prove that “it” was actually legal – but it is something.  Nevertheless, I, at least, found Mr. Iwry’s examples deeply unpersuasive.  In some of his examples, the statutes in question granted the Secretary broad authority to suspend or even amend portions of the law Congress had passed in order to make it work.  The ACA, as we have discussed, grants no such authority with respect to the Mandate.  In other examples, existing rules were deemed adequate to address the necessary provisions of new law as temporary rules while new rules were still under consideration.  In other examples, reporting and tax collection were temporarily *delayed*… but in no case were tax penalties simply *cancelled* without authorization in the statute to cancel them.  You can check for yourself: the authorities Mr. Iwry cited were Treasury Notices [2007-54](http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-07-54.pdf), [2000-5](http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-2000-5.pdf), [2005-29](http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-05-29.pdf), [2006-2](http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-06-02.pdf), [2007-4](http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-07-04.pdf), [2005-94](http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-05-94.pdf), [2006-100](http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-06-100.pdf), [2007-89](http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-07-89.pdf), [2008-115](http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-08-115.pdf), [96-64]( http://www.unclefed.com/Tax-Bulls/1996/NOT96-64.PDF), [99-40]( http://www.legalbitstream.com/scripts/isyswebext.dll?op=get&amp;uri=/isysquery/irl7c93/1/doc), and [Announcement 95-48](http://www.legalbitstream.com/scripts/isyswebext.dll?op=get&amp;uri=/isysquery/irl7c65/3/doc).   On my reading, none of these cases bears even a plausible similarity to the case of the Employer Mandate suspension.  Even though, in Mr. Iwry’s example cases, the IRS and Treasury *did* do a great deal of juggling with reporting requirements and the calendar, they always made certain, in the end, that the government was paid *all* the taxes that Congress had imposed.  The suspension of the Employer Mandate (officially codified in [Notice 2013-45](http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-13-45.PDF)) is not pushing off the due dates for the penalties until all the regulations and technology are in place, as it could (and should); it is *cancelling* the penalties outright – refusing to collect taxes that Congress has imposed.  As it states, “no employer shared responsibility payments will be assessed for 2014.”  As I understand the law, this is illegal – blatantly so.

Mr. Iwry also listed as authorities several actions from during the Obama Presidency.  Since the Obama White House is what’s under examination here, I have declined to confer precedential value on them, and I am not including them in my analysis.  If the only legal leg the Administration has to stand on is that *this very Administration* has already broken the law in this way before, that’d be less of a defense and more of an admission of broad unlawfulness!

**DISCUSSION**

So, question 1: has the Obama Administration violated the law?

The implications are, I take it, obvious to all neutrons.  If the President can, on his own authority, suspend a duly passed, concededly constitutional law, indefinitely, despite the express orders of Congress as expressed by the statute in question, then we no longer live in a democratic republic, but a democratic monarchy, with the President being the ultimate arbiter of law and order and Congress being merely an advisory body.  President Mitt Romney could simply suspend all of Obamacare permanently, effectively repealing it without ever getting a vote through Congress to do so.  President Ted Cruz could announce that he is suspending indefinitely all the Obama-era tax hikes on high-earners and capital gains, returning to Bush-era taxation by fiat – or, heck, he could just suspend laws hither and thither until he’s effectively abolished the progressive income tax and imposed a flat tax in its place.  President Hilary Clinton could announce that Congress is moving too slow on immigration reform and simply legalize everyone by suspending all statutes to the contrary.  Some of these policies would be good; some of them would be bad.  But *none* of them, imposed by presidential fiat, would be constitutional, nor in any way compatible with our system of broad, consensus-based representative democracy.  This is precisely why the Constitution requires the President to swear, on taking office, to “take care that the laws be faithfully executed.”

Which brings me to question 2: If the President has violated the law in this way, what legal remedies are available to restrict the president back within his Constitutional limits?  

The normal answer is “lawsuit,” but it turns out that, in all likelihood, nobody has standing to sue the President over this, so the courts can’t adjudicate it.

For its part, Congress did something quite unexpected to try to fix the situation last week: the Republicans actually decided, “Hey, we hate the employer mandate, so we are all for suspending it,” and they actually passed a bill, [HR 2667](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-113hr2667ih/pdf/BILLS-113hr2667ih.pdf) that gave the President statutory authority to make this change.  Shockingly, rather than accept the legal fig leaf this bill would have provided, the White House [issued a veto threat](http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/legislative/sap/113/saphr2667r_20130716.pdf) (presumably for political reasons; the GOP was exploiting the issue for political points) and HR2667 is now dead in the Senate.

This seems to leave us between a rock and a hard place.  The courts can’t force the President’s hand unless someone can find standing to challenge the action, so the judicial branch is out of the game; Congress has already attempted to make peace by means of a statutory remedy and been rebuffed; and the President himself is doggedly refusing to change course even as he fails to provide even a plausible case for the legality of his action.  The only remedy I can still see on the table is impeachment.  

It seems like a very strange thing for Congress to impeach the President for suspending a law that a majority of Congress aggressively opposes to begin with, and ironic in the extreme to impeach the President for violating a law that he himself considers his signature achievement… but there is also the larger principle at stake: we have to protect the bedrock American principle that we follow the rule of law, not the rule of men.  

I don’t like the idea of impeaching somebody over an issue that is closely tied to broader questions of health care reform, the most politically polarized issue of the past several years.  I’d feel much more comfortable impeaching someone for something clearly apolitical, like murdering a prostitute or being constantly drunk all the time.  I also (personal note) hate the idea of President Joe Biden.  But the President takes an oath to “take care that all the laws be faithfully executed,” and clearly refusing to do so has to carry a price, or our democracy fails.  So, if I were in Congress today, I’d probably move to open an impeachment proceeding.

On the one hand, I’d love for /r/neutralpolitics to talk me down from that ledge.  On the other, I’m fairly convinced, so it could take some pushing.  Let’s discuss!

Also, congratulations on making it all the way through that wall of text.

***

**TL;DR:** By suspending the employer mandate, the President *appears* to have plainly and directly violated his oath to ""take care that all the laws be faithfully executed.""  If this precedent stands, it threatens to transform our republic into a monarchy.   Is there a constitutional remedy short of impeachment, or is that the only option on the table?  But, seriously, please read the whole thing before you comment.

Can any amount of legislation prevent this?

If the shootings in Aurora and Newtown (and by extension, Virginia Tech, Columbine, etc.) had followed a pattern, if there were:

* a certain kind of weapon we could ban
* a certain kind of person we need to watch out for
* a certain place that needed more security
* a certain region that had the most shootings

then I feel like we could effectively legislate to prevent these kinds of incidents. As it is, these shootings have:

* been perpetrated using a variety of weapons, including non-assault rifles with small magazines
* been perpetrated by individuals who didn't show enough signs of mental illness to be institutionalized
* taken place in school buildings, on school campuses... but also in a movie theater. And it would seem that many public places could be at equal risk.
* have happened in random locations across the US

So in short, is there any kind of legislation we can put into place to prevent this type of incident (which has a near 0% chance of happening in any given place, on any given day, by any given person) from happening?

Or would that be like legislating against similarly rare disasters? For instance, we could legislate against plane crashes, but we would pretty much need to stop travelling by airplane at this point, as they are so exceedingly rare.

So onto the point I think most information on both sides of this issue are heavily skewed by *feelings* instead of facts.  So here are the facts as I have found them.

From my research from both the CDC and the Guttermach Institute the majority of abortions are performed for single white women between the ages of 20-24 and only 10.5% of them actually are due to rape, incest, or health concerns.  Only 1% of abortions happen after the 21st week.

Currently viability is somewhat weakly defined, viability is considered where the fetus could survive outside the womb and is currently the cut-off point for abortions. If 50% of fetus could survive is the cutoff, however these are averages, not per person basis (it isn't calculated per fetus).  

The survival rate for a fetus is 25 percent in the 23rd week, 42 percent in the 24th week, 57 percent in 25th week. By the 30th week, when a newborn doesn't require a ventilator to breathe, it has a 90 percent chance of survival, this is of course assuming that there is adequate medical equipment to provide life support.

And a note on poverty (Guttermach):
[""Women with incomes below 200% of poverty made up 30% of all women of reproductive age, but accounted for 57% of all women having abortions in 2000: Twenty-seven percent of abortions were obtained by women living below the poverty line, and another 31% by women with incomes of 100-199% of poverty. The concentration of economically disadvantaged women among those having abortions was greater in 2000 than in 1994, when 50% of women obtaining abortions had incomes of less than 200% of poverty.""](http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/3422602.html)

* Most people do not have the time to really look into an issue's fine points and make informed decisions about who/what they are voting for. Extremely biased information sources make it even harder.

* Groups always have an incentive to vote for handouts/money now as opposed to thinking about how that money or handout will affect society in the long term.

* Democracy encourages politicians to strive to fulfill seemingly immediately justifiable social needs, perhaps at the expense of long term economic growth. 

* Constant switching of leaders might make them more worried about ""political capital"" and worrying about keeping their voters happy rather than make the maybe unpopular optimal economic decision. 

* Democracy might make people who are good at discourse/talking leaders rather than people who are experts on an issue but are more reserved and quiet. \

* Democracy gives political force to groups that perhaps should not have it, like highly religious groups.

* Systems of checks and balances are sometimes really expensive, and for economies that seek to lift themselves out of development, it could be extremely crippling to the development process.

&gt;In another incident highlighting the fragile situation in Afghanistan, only hours after announcing they would hold talks with the U.S., the Taliban claimed responsibility Wednesday for an attack on the Bagram Air Base in which four American troops were killed.

&gt;Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid said the insurgents fired two rockets into the base outside the Afghan capital, Kabul, late on Tuesday. American officials confirmed the base had come under attack by indirect fire -- likely a mortar or rocket -- and that four U.S. troops were killed.

&gt;Also Tuesday, five Afghan police officers were killed at a security outpost in Helmand province by five of their comrades, officials said, the latest in a string of so-called ""insider attacks"" that have shaken the confidence of the nascent Afghan security forces. Local official Mohammad Fahim Mosazai said the five officers had only been on the local force for three months. He blamed the killings on Taliban infiltrators, saying the gunmen escaped with the victims' weapons.

Does the [announced US departure date](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Withdrawal_of_U.S._troops_from_Afghanistan) and recent [turn over of command from the NATO forces to the Afghan forces](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/18/afghan-forces-take-over-security-nato) factor in?

The Schengen Area operates as a single international travel and immigration area with no border controls for people travelling between Schengen countries and only external border controls for those travelling in and out of the area.

Let's think about this. I understand hardliners would be absolutely against this but I think there are plenty of benefits to be had.

* The first question needed to be answered is, ""would a similar agreement jeopardize the security for either country?"" 

I don't think it would. There hasn't been a terrorist attack since 2001. Canada and U.S. share the largest border in the world, if someone wants to get to the u.s. or Canada illegally, they already can. 

* Would the U.S and Canada save a lot of money by dissolving these borders? 

Again, I think so. We can divert that cash to protecting our southern border.

* What are the economic advantages?

This is really the cog of my argument. But I have trouble finding positive economic advantages for Canada...please help! I live in Buffalo, a border city close in proximity to Toronto. The amount of Canadians that come to our malls, grocery stores, and our airport accounts for probably half of our GDP. I can only imagine the further benefits by opening the borders...not just for Buffalo, but Seattle, Detroit, and even Cleveland, Portland, and Syracuse. This is helped by the U.S.'s weak dollar.

* Would this increase tourism?

I think so. I host foreigners through couch surfing and often times people from the Czech, for instance, can't go to Canada...and living 10 minutes away from Niagara Falls, they're forced to stay on the Whittier American side

I would also like to propose an opt out clause for border states/provinces that so not want to participate ie. Quebec. This should be an entertaining conversation!


Edit: Perhaps a major economic benefit to Canada and their businesses is access to an abundance of cheaper labor...especially in the ""rust-belt"" corridor (Buffalo, Pitt, Cleve, Det).

A Critique of Reinhart and Rogoff""](http://www.peri.umass.edu/236/hash/31e2ff374b6377b2ddec04deaa6388b1/publication/566/), principally authored by graduate student Thomas Herndon in conjunction with his professors, claims that a 2010 study supporting the idea of austerity has fatal errors in data and methodology.

This paper, [""Growth in a Time of Debt""](http://www.nber.org/papers/w15639) by Harvard professors Reinhart and Rogoff, has been cited by American and European policymakers to support the idea that high debt is a cause of economic stagnation, and that aggressive debt reduction is a valid strategy.

A key piece of this is showing that countries with high debt have issues with economic growth. Herndon found an error in the data sheets:

&gt;What Herndon had discovered was that by making a sloppy computing error, Reinhart and Rogoff had forgotten to include a critical piece of data about countries with high debt-to-GDP ratios that would have affected their overall calculations. They had also excluded data from Canada, New Zealand, and Australia — all countries that experienced solid growth during periods of high debt and would thus undercut their thesis that high debt forestalls growth.

[Source](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2013/04/grad-student-who-shook-global-austerity-movement.html)

An additional problem was what the paper said compared to what the authors told politicians it said. [The Atlantic](http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/04/forget-excel-this-was-reinhart-and-rogoffs-biggest-mistake/275088/) points out that the thesis is a correlation- high debts leads to low growth. But the correlation is much stronger with debt to past GDP rather than future GDP. This could very well mean that low growth leads to high debt, rather than the inverse.

Austerity has been politically unpopular (see the protests and radicalization in Greece, for both the [right](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/01/world/europe/amid-greeces-worries-the-rise-of-right-wing-extremists.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0) and the [left](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/12/world/europe/in-greece-leftist-party-syriza-upends-politics.html?pagewanted=all)).

I stumbled upon Charles Wheelan’s book, The Centrist Manifesto, (http://www.thecentristmovement.org/big-idea/) and he proposes an interesting method of battling the plague of partisanship. (Give this page a read for a more in-depth summary).

The basic premise is based around a Centrist Party that isn’t a halfway point between the two current parties, but rather one that builds off the best of the two parties’ core ideologies and leaves the extremist baggage behind.

Relevant sections from The Centrist Manifesto:

“After all, there is a lot to like about the Republicans: a belief in personal responsibility, a respect for markets and the forces of wealth creation, an understanding of the economic costs of taxation and regulation, and a healthy skepticism of what government can and cannot accomplish.

And there is a lot to like about the Democrats: a concern for working people, a commitment to a strong social safety net, an impressive record of social tolerance, a long-standing concern for the environment, and a recognition that government can play a crucial role in protecting us from the most egregious abuses of capitalism.”

Rather than focusing on the House or the Presidency, Wheelan believes the most effective path for such a party is by obtaining around five “Centrist seats” in the Senate. Without a majority, both parties need to garner support from the Centrists in order to pass legislation.

Wheelan notes that, historically, America has not been particularly receptive to third parties, but these tend to be parties emerging from the political fringe or ones whose ideology is tied to single issues (e.g. Green Party). Such parties, he argues, are incapable of appealing to the moderate American population at large. When you consider the races to the political fringe which occur during political primaries and the subsequent race back to the center during the general election, Wheelan argues that this provides an interesting opportunity for moderates. Why tailor your party to ideas which are not necessarily successful in general elections? Instead, why not create a party that would be successful in a general election from the get-go, one that occupies the political middle and is built around pragmatism and compromise?

**With America’s current winner take all voting structure, is such an infant party even viable today?**

**Although such a party could potentially appeal to the “big, fat middle” of American voters, is this enough to overcome the challenges traditionally faced by third parties?**

**EDIT:** There seems to be a lot of cynicism here. I'm just curious as to what people think a better option to a moderate third party would be. Right now, the current system is one large positive feedback loop. The more polarized the political environment gets, the less likely moderates are to get involved in the political process (and the more the system is left to be run by those with more extreme positions). Something like this doesn't look like its going to fix itself. 

When you just say ""nope, no chance something like this could work,"" what else is on the table? If not this, what then? I don't disagree that there are plenty of structural changes that would help the government operate better, but some of the suggestions here (e.g. abandoning the two current parties for state parties) don't seem remotely feasible. I agree with calls to ""change the rules"" by going to systems like IRV, but those sorts of reforms would be extremely slow moving compared to some kind of moderate grassroots movement. I'm happy to be proven wrong, but a ""radical center"" (even if a Centrist Party isn't the way it manifests itself) that energizes the middle actually sounds somewhat realistic. 

Also, even if you disagree, I'd give the book a read, its short (only about 130 pages) and Wheelan is actually a pretty funny guy. ",,False,,t5_2tk0i,1373507606.0,,,True,t3_1i0o39,http://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/1i0o39/what_is_the_viability_of_a_centrist_third_party/,

The White House on Wednesday released the legal details behind its ObamaCare bailout for Members of Congress and their staffs, and if anything this rescue is worse than last week's leaks suggested: Illegal dispensations for the ruling class, different rules for the hoi polloi.

Thanks to an amendment from Iowa Senator Chuck Grassley that Democrats enacted in 2010, the Affordable Care Act says that ""the only health plans that the Federal Government may make available"" to Congress are the ones offered on the ObamaCare insurance exchanges. But Members and many aides have been flipping out because they won't qualify for ObamaCare subsidies and they'll lose employer contributions they now receive under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, or FEHBP, which picks up about three-quarters of the average premium.

At President Obama's personal request, the Office of Personnel Management decreed that the Members don't have to get off the gravy train after all. The eat-your-own-cooking provision begins with the phrase ""Notwithstanding any other provision of law."" The feds now interpret that clause as a loophole to mean that the Affordable Care Act did not change the 1959 law that created the FEHBP.

Since Members and staff still technically meet the definition of federal employees qualified for the FEHBP, the Administration says they're still entitled to enroll in the FEHBP concurrently with the exchanges. The feds then ""clarify""—their euphemism—that the regulatory meaning of health benefits in the FEHBP can be ObamaCare plans. Voila, taxpayers will continue to chip in $4,900 for individual and $10,000 for family coverage.

The charitable term for such legal gymnastics is creative. When statutes conflict, the bedrock administrative law obligation is to enforce the most recent statute. ""Notwithstanding"" clauses are routine catchalls that are supposed to emphasize Congress's intent that a new bill is controlling and pre-empts other laws on the books.

The White House is claiming the clause means the opposite, as if the 2010 law and the 1959 law have nothing to do with each other. That is not how it is supposed to work. When Congress kicked itself out of the traditional FEHBP, it kicked itself out of the FEHBP.

At least the Members will still have to sign up for exchange coverage as the law requires. Given the lawless White House record, it probably considered finding some excuse to exempt Congress entirely and decided that option was too explosive politically. But creating a special financing stream for the political class is almost as much of an abuse.

ObamaCare's complex subsidy system, with varying levels based on income, is not incidental to the exchanges. It's the beating heart of this exercise in wealth redistribution and social and economic central planning. The entitlement's architects never envisioned that well-to-do movers and shakers—Mr. Obama might even call some of them ""the rich""—would get (or deserve) taxpayer benefits merely because they happen to run for or work for Congress.

Millionaire Senators and the affluent professionals who are chiefs of staff, legislative directors and the like were supposed to go on the exchange and abide by its rules. There are only three insurers offering public utility-type plans on the Washington, D.C. ObamaCare exchange. The FEHBP sponsors 21 plans in metro D.C. and 24 in Virginia. Perhaps as a new perquisite the White House will entice a plan to the exchange that only Members can choose.

It would have been fairer and less corrosive to the rule of law had Congress simply passed a bill giving their workers a raise to make up for the lost compensation of dropping out of the FEHBP. But that would mean an ugly political fight that voters might notice. It's so much easier to slip through this political fix in August when Congress is out of session and the press corps can't wait to hit the beach.",,False,,t5_2tk0i,False,,,True,t3_1kafvw,http://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/1kafvw/was_wondering_what_a_neutral_forum_would_make_of/,

Nevertheless, those who seek the truth above all else are few in number. Many more prefer to seek comfort and reassurance, going as far as to avert their eyes when faced with the blinding light of truth. We, however, look on. I argue we seek the truth because we find it meaningful. 1 + 1 = 2 is meaningful. We can use it, we can build upon it. But what if I said 1 + 1 is three, and that 1 + 1 = 4, then what? That is the danger of arbitrariness which is the enemy of truth. Arbitrariness in another form is bias, which we disdain. 

So if I ask you the question, “what rules ought to govern society?” how would you respond? Philosopher John Rawls utilized a thought experiment to answer this question. The hypothetical is as follows: imagine a meeting where a group of people will decide the rules of governance and “no one knows his place in society, his class position or social status; nor does he know his fortune in the distribution of natural assets and abilities, his intelligence and strength, and the like.” What laws would they establish?

Can you establish slavery? In this new society it is uncertain whether I will be a slave or not, so acting in my self-interest I would not allow slavery. 

Should women be rulers over men? I do not know whether I am a man or woman, so it would be better if everyone had equal rights. 

Should the handicapped be given reasonable accommodations? Well, if I were handicapped I would certainly prefer to have the accommodations, and if I’m not I would not mind mandating accommodations.  

Should homeowners be allowed the mortgage interest tax deduction? Ah, well that is a tricky one. I’ll let you decide.

But the point is to always evaluate a rule universally. One cannot allow the banker to dictate the law from the point of view of the banker. Would he agree with himself if he were not a banker at all? If he does not then the point of view is a bias one, and should not be considered. This is an example of the principle we should follow.

1.) Cut military spending (How? What specifically would you cut?).

2.) Reduce or control spending on programs like Medicare, Social Security (Lower benefits? Tighter eligibility?).

3.) New taxes, or lower taxes (On who? How much?).

1376413499.0,72,self.NeutralPolitics,1kae3f,Why is there so little voter fraud in the US?,111,39,122,http://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/1kae3f/why_is_there_so_little_voter_fraud_in_the_us/,"By many accounts, rates of voter fraud in the US are vanishingly low: as a percentage of votes cast in nationwide elections, the number of fraud reports that were substantial enough to even warrant further investigation has been reported at around [0.002 percent](http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2013/05/23/Husted-voter-fraud-exists-not-an-epidemic.html), or one investigation per every 50,000 votes cast. (This [Brennan Center report](http://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/legacy/The%20Truth%20About%20Voter%20Fraud.pdf) is more thorough, and finds rates of *confirmed* fraudulent votes at closer to 0.0003 percent, or one fraudulent vote per 333,000 cast.)

To put this rate in context, I thought of comparing it to the rate of another type of identity fraud, ID theft. In the period of time from 2001-2010, the [FTC received about 2.3 million complaints of identity theft](http://www.ftc.gov/sentinel/reports/sentinel-annual-reports/sentinel-cy2010.pdf). That's a rate of about one reported identity fraud per 500 creditholders, per year. Even taken as a percentage of the total number of electronic financial transactions per year [(about 921 billion from 2001-2010, extrapolating from this Federal Reserve study)](http://www.frbservices.org/files/communications/pdf/research/2007_payments_study.pdf), that's one report of fraud per 397,000 individual transactions - closer to the rate of confirmed voter fraud but artificially small IMO since individual cases of ID thefts are often associated with more than one individual transaction. I'm thinking its easier for an ID thief to run up ten fraudulent transactions than for a fraudulent voter to vote ten times.

So, US voter fraud is quite rare, even compared to other types of fraud. Yet, proponents of voter ID laws claim that the system has few safeguards against fraudulent voting - and meet voter fraud statistics with shock and disbelief. 

Neutrons, why do you think the incidence of voter fraud is as low as it is? Might it be:

. Voting occurs all at once, on one day every couple of years, limiting the opportunity to commit fraud (where, e.g., ID theft can be committed anytime and may continue on an ongoing basis)?
. The direct benefit to the fraudster is much lower than in other types of fraud (e.g., ID theft can result in immediate financial benefit but voter fraud *might* possibly result in an electoral victory, but only if it occurs at a wide enough scale in one direction)?
. Voting is inherently a more public action than, say, financial transactions can be, increasing the perceived risk of being caught?

Or some other factor I've left out? Or is it just coincidence?

**EDIT:** So many great points made in the comments! Personally, I think these potential answers deserve their own threads:

* *We aren't able to detect/measure voter fraud.* Unlike other frauds where the victims are individuals, fraudulent voting defrauds the ""system"" - so when it happens there is no aggrieved victim to file a complaint. The lack of checks in most states' systems to correlate voters with their registrations with their votes also makes detection of fraud, from whatever the source, difficult at best. To me, this is an especially important point (thanks /u/Gnome_Sane for emphasizing this).
* *The risk/reward ratio is too high.* This is a sensible theory IMHO when applied to noncitizens running the risk of possible deportation along with their families (!) but less so for citizens who might vote fraudulently. Why should voter fraud occur at such dramatically lower rates than other criminal offenses that come with even higher risks and seemingly less reward (such as, say, rape)?
* *No one watches the watchers:* States have considerable latitude in setting their registration and voting procedures, and it is therefore harder for any organization to have oversight across state lines.",,False,,t5_2tk0i,1376449464.0,,,True,t3_1kae3f,http://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/1kae3f/why_is_there_so_little_voter_fraud_in_the_us/,

Most of the times the presentations don't reach the public in any form.

While I disagree with the cash wall made to block the public out, I can agree that a majority of people don't care and won't use these papers as sources. Additionally, I understand that organizing events in general cost money, and that flying professors out from the other side of the world adds to that budget.

I don't feel academia owes the public it's research because though it pays taxes, the source of money for research can be traced to corporations, nothing wrong there. At the same time it's a shame that the average person's best source is wikipedia, and not the sources it cites.

The immigration bill that went through the Senate wants to increase enforcement by $3 billion, and if effectiveness is not 90% by year 5, it will add another $2 million.  

I need to point out that the 40%-55% number and 90% number are from 2 different sources.  That is, the Dept of Homeland Security currently estimates that 84% of all attempted crossings are stopped at the border.  So the extra $3 billion is to get from 84% to 90% and not from 50% to 90%.  So the extra $3 billion is to improve by 6% and not 40%.  I hope that doesn't sound too convoluted.

[Another article](http://www.washingtontimes.com/blog/inside-politics/2013/jun/24/cbo-border-amendment-reduce-illegal-immigration/) points to the CBO clarifying its original report and states that 75% of illegal immigration will continue even if the border is made more secure.  This is because a lot of people do not leave when their visas expire - so they didn't cross illegally but are in the country illegally nonetheless.

At some point, the amount of money spent patrolling the Southern border will be more than the proposed benefit of locking down the border - something of a Pyrrhic victory.  At least I would think so.  But that is my question: Is this investment in border security worth it?  Is stopping illegal entry as important as lawmakers are making it or are they simply responding to populist sentiment?

Finally, I think one interesting piece of this is that the [CBO projects](http://www.cbo.gov/publication/44346) that amnesty will be beneficial to the Federal Balance Sheet in the long run since they will be paying taxes (approximately $200 billion net positive).

I know there are a lot more pieces to this debate, but I thought that border security was an interesting place to start and keep my question focused.

One is what to do about the 11 million illegal immigrants currently in the country. The other is how to attract and retain educated, skilled immigrants. The two issues  tend to be conflated together under the single issue of ""immigration reform"", for good political reasons, but in this post I'd like to talk exclusively about the latter. 

Though illegal immigration dominates the debate, the issue of educated, skilled immigration does come up from time to time. Those will skills in the so-called ""STEM"" fields (science, technology, engineering, and math) seem to be of particular concern. Last November the STEM Jobs Act died in the Senate because Democrats opposed the elimination of the diversity visa. Now a new bill, the Immigration Innovation Act, seeks to do approximately the same without courting equal controversy. 

As an engineering student, I'm curious as to why ""STEM"" is such a large focus. From what I can tell, the idea that America lacks scientists and engineers dates all the way back to Sputnik. Ever since the Soviets launched the beeping metal grapefruit into space, America has been filled with doom and gloom over its state of math and science education and the number, as well as quality, of its scientists and engineers. One can find proclamations of a STEM deficit every year over the decades, to the extent that it seems like an utterly intractable problem. Interestingly enough, we live in a free-market society with relatively free movement of labor, where market forces are supposed to ensure that no permanent deficit of talent persists over time. 

As you can probably tell by now, I'm not convinced that we have a big problem with a lack of scientists and engineers. The dean of my engineering school seems to agree. When interviewed about a year ago by a national media publication, I forget which, he was asked if America has a shortage of engineers, to which he flatly responded, ""Not at all"". Of course, whether this is true depends on whom you ask. Technology companies, understandably, are always complaining about failing to find good (read: cheap) talent. Professional organizations like the IEEE, or at least their members, strongly [oppose](http://blogs.computerworld.com/the_h_1b_battle_the_war_within_ieee) such a view. 

What I'm interested in is why both sides of the aisle seem to agree on everything ""STEM"". Why don't we import more foreign lawyers, bankers, or, God forbid, politicians? I'm only half-joking in the last. 

The answer, I believe, simply lies in the fact that few members of Congress have STEM backgrounds. To them, STEM is a very abstract concept, one that is conveniently always on the ""good"" side of political debates. Who can argue against having more scientists and engineers? It's incredibly easy to say ""I'm for STEM education"" or ""I'm for more STEM immigrants"". 

I welcome the idea of more educated and skilled immigrants, STEM or not, into the country. I just think that politicians bandying the term ""STEM"" about to win political points is ignorant and distasteful.

http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/10/sunday-review/the-liberals-against-affirmative-action.html

Why would race based affirmative action be preferred over class based affirmative action?

It is obvious to everyone that a poor white student with little resources would still do worse than a rich preferred minority student with access to SAT prep classes and private tutors.

I have seen reports where when one's overall wealth (not just income) was equalized, the racial component in standardized testing disappears.

For those not familiar with the issue, grade schoolers are required to take standardized tests to meet education requirements. These tests vary by state (if I remember correctly).  The issue is that many people think that they detract from real education and are actively harmful to students due to the amount of stress they cause. However, I feel like that has not been the case in my individual experience.

I attended public school in America (specifically Tennessee) from 1999 to 2012. We were mandated to take the state required test from about grades 3 to 8. For high school graduation, we were required to take three tests in Algebra I, Biology, and English. However, I have to note, one only had to get between 50-70% of the questions right on the tests to satisfy the requirement.

However, in elementary school, we were actually pretty excited for the week where we took the tests. As far as I could tell, most of us thought they were very easy, and then we got snacks and extra recess. In middle school, we didn't get any of these things, but we still found the tests pretty easy. 

As for the high school tests, I, along with most people from my school, took one set of tests (Algebra I) in middle school. To me, it'd been the easiest test all year. As for the other two, I took them freshman year, and again, they'd been pretty easy. In fact, they were considered to be our exam grade for the course, so my grade was actually boosted. Some time after that, the graduation requirements were changed for new students so I'm not sure what had happened after that.

The thing is, I found those tests to be the absolute bare minimum for what should have been learned at grade level. I know that I was very good at those sort of tests, which not everyone could be, but I'm not so sure that there is any other way to ensure that students are learning what they are supposed to. I don't think that standardized tests are able to correctly measure mastery of material, but I can't think of any other practical method. 

In an ideal world, maybe every kid could receive Montessori or free schooling or whatever, but this just seems to be the best way I can think of. What are your thoughts on this?

What does ""living"" mean?",97,28,308,http://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/1j2u1g/minimum_wage_should_it_be_a_living_wage_what_does/,"There isn't a simple answer to this, and I'm curious to see peoples thoughts on this.  

What initiated this question is what I believe are two examples that this debate over minimum wage hasn't hit the sweet spot yet.  I'm sure you've all seen them on either Reddit or Facebook at some time or another.  The first is McDonalds ""sample budget"".  The other is the map of how many hours it would take to work at minimum wage to afford a two-bedroom apartment.

I find it problematic in the former example that they suggest that you should work over 70 hours per week to survive on minimum wage on ones own.  Suggesting, to me anyways, that the minimum wage is way too low.  In the latter example, I question whether if the benchmark for a minimum wage should be a two bedroom apartment. I am not convinced that the minimum wage should be designed to take care of more than one person. So that map implies to me that maybe people are aiming too high in terms of a minimum wage.

For a base to start (as I know it's much easier to tear apart an argument and come up with an alternative than to start cold).  I believe that it's a fair social contract that if you work full-time equivalent (40-45 hours/week-- though I fully realize that many employers intentionally don't offer this many hours to lower level employees for ""flexibility""), that should allow someone to live stably and the ends should meet.  Most landlords say that your rent should equate to no more than 30%-35% of your pre-tax income to qualify for an apartment, and from my experience that's a fair estimate.  So I'd say that earnings commensurate with being able to afford an average studio or one-bedroom  for a particular [MSA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Statistical_Area) is a good starting point. 

I think it's also fair to expect that two minimum wage incomes be enough to support a child, and if only one income is available, we find other means other than a minimum wage to support that--I believe that letting children starve does the country more harm than good in the long-run, not to mention that it's inhumane.

What do you think a proper minimum wage should support? Should there be other metrics we should consider other than housing?

Thanks to everyone who applied. We will be contacting each of you in the coming days.**

As many long-time participants have noticed, we don't have enough moderator manpower to maintain quality discussion in this sub given our rapidly-expanding subscriber base. So, we're putting out the call to bring a few more good mods on board.

Here's what the job entails:

First, you need to have *time*. /r/NeutralPolitics is a heavily moderated subreddit that requires mods to check in every day. Some days there won't be much to do, but others you'll have to spend up to an hour reading posts and messaging people. For our regulars, that's probably close to their participation pattern anyway, but applicants should understand that there's a time commitment involved.

Second, you need to be familiar with the [guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/18igw6/meta_guidelines_for_rneutralpolitics/) and understand the type of community we're trying to build. It's kind of like a garden: left unattended, some of the plants will creep around and get unruly, but if you stay on top of it, it's a really neat place to hang out.

Mods read all submissions, and we're making an effort to read all comments as well. Roughly 25% of submissions to /r/NeutralPolitics get removed by a mod for not conforming to the guidelines. In each of those cases, the mod who removes the post will message the OP explaining why the post was removed.

Comments that don't conform to the guidelines are also removed, though they're more difficult to pick out than submissions. In order to help new users acclimate to our standards of discourse, we are refocusing our efforts to maintain moderator presence in the comments, so you'll be expected to reply to some of those as well.  

Other responsibilities include:

* Message an OP asking him to modify his submission.
* Take note of problem users and bring them to the attention of other mods.
* If you have a question about a post, submit it to other mods for review.
* Join discussions with other mods about ways to improve the subreddit.
* And of course, participate in the sub as a normal user.

If you're interested in becoming a mod in /r/NeutralPolitics, [message us](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FNeutralPolitics) with a brief explanation of why you want to join the team and why you would be a good fit.

“That is, because of institutions such as the Electoral College, the winner-take-all representation mechanism, and the Senate filibuster, as well as the geographic distribution of partisanship to modern partisan polarization, minority interests often successfully block majority preferences,” Barker and Bearce wrote. “Thus, even if the median voter supports policies designed to slow global warming, legislation to effect such change could find itself dead on arrival if the median Republican voter strongly resists public policy environmentalism at least in part because of end-times beliefs.”

I'd also posit that the current system favors geographic, rural minorities over other minorities -- urban poor, gays, Muslims, etc.. What is the justification of this?

Here are some arguments for:

* The current monopolies seem to be doing a bad job of providing the best service at a reasonable cost.
* The barriers to entry are so high (laying cable, buying network access from other ISPs, etc.) that no new companies can easily join the market.
* Google Fiber is doing a good job, but they're more of an exception than the rule. Also, I'm also not sure that they'll really roll out nationwide, even if they succeed in speeding up Kansas City.

Some arguments against:

* If the government controls the internet, they can spy on us without oversight.
* The government may attempt to censor the internet.

Regarding the point about spying, I feel like our privacy is already pretty much gone. There are also privacy measures (such as Tor, [cryptocat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocat), Bitcoin, etc.) that will work no matter who controls the internet, because they are secure by design. Many of these allow access to distributed networks that host content, so that covers censorship too.

I realize that, in light of things like SOPA, PIPA, CISPA, ACTA, etc. trusting the internet to the government seems like a stupid idea. However, the companies we currently trust it to also don't seem to have our best interests at heart. Is there a way to have democratic control of the internet?

EDIT: One more argument for nationalization. Right now, the internet is a bunch of wires owned by other people (ISPs). We keep talking about ""Internet Freedom"", but where do we get the right to do what we want with other people's wires?

I've been taking an American economic history course this semester, and we've begun several chapters on the 1920s, the first phase of the Depression (the Great Contraction), and onwards to the New Deal and related policy. What strikes me is the depth of the crisis (individuals, banks, financial institutions, government from local on up, the consumer culture and the corporate structure of the time) and how many explanations have been forwarded about its causes and its persistence- each with different cautionary tales at the end.

Obviously the Great Depression was a global problem (and non-US experiences are not taught at this level of university education where I live), and the gold standard across many countries was one of the most prominent international concerns in the crisis. 

The present crisis (or rather, series of bubbles and crises wrapped into one) is not identical. But given the sheer amount of information and the great length of the Great Depression, there must be some wisdom to extract. I will state that most likely the mainstream media doesn't go very deep when invoking the 1930s, so there may be things that aren't said on a wide stage.

1. It is absolutely inexcusable and pathetic that I had to go onto a website (Fox News) to stream this live, rather than it being front headline news. CNN didn't even cover this event, instead placing their own analysis rather than let the viewer decide for him/herself what to make of the contents of the testimony. 

2. The basis upon which the NSA and FBI made their claims seems to be a lot on the justification of federal oversight. There were countless checks and balances that they listed as reasonable oversight for their operations. 

3. It is very important to realize that the FBI considers section 705 of the Patriot Act to be more important than the 4th Amendment: in fact, the FBI director said himself that phone snooping was lawful under the Patriot Act. 

4. The issue of FISA. There was a lot talked about FISA, but I can't ignore the fact that FISA has almost never denied a single query request made by the NSA. I think FISA sets some nice standards, and the NSA and the FBI were very clear saying that they needed explicit court orders from them to pursue any kind of higher level electronic surveillance on an individual, but they were not very clear on how to get that court order in the first place. The claim is that they have to prove reasonable suspicion to get the court order and **this was not elaborated on whatsoever in the testimony, only stating that FISA had a set of standards they give to the NSA.** I want to know what these standards are. 

5. My main problem arises with their statements that Snowden's revelations hurt national security. I see literally no reason as to why the information they disclosed to the public had to be classified. All they did was explain how their program works, and if we as Americans don't have a right to that, the NSA is not our biggest problem.

The day the sequester takes effect.

This brought to mind for me that the way negotiations happen behind closed doors must be much different than how they're described to be playing out for the press.  Regardless of anyone's position on the sequester, I can't fathom that they'd wait until it takes effect before discussing its resolution.

There are a few angles to this.  One is the various perceptions about the effect of the sequester, should it happen.  Perceptions range from something awful that will [shave off 1-1.5% off of growth](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/02/27/bernanke-the-sequester-could-make-it-harder-to-reduce-the-deficit-not-easier/), to something that's [not so bad](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/02/27/economic-armageddon-impact-sequester-may-be-over-hyped/).

There's another angle to this about how each party perceives who the winners and losers will be if it happens.  Republicans were considered to be the losers coming out of the government shutdown back in the 90s.  This time around, those playing chicken on the issue must at some level be thinking that the other party will end up looking worse, should the sequester come to pass.

It is written by Melvyn P. Leffler, Edward Stettinius Professor of History at the University of Virginia. Given the other post asking about Bush, I thought all of you interested in understanding his Presidency would benefit from an informed, academic perspective.**

Ten years after 9/11, we can begin to gain some perspective on the impact of that day's terrorist attacks on U.S. foreign policy. There was, and there remains, a natural tendency to say that the attacks changed everything. But a decade on, such conclusions seem unjustified. September 11 did alter the focus and foreign policy of the George W. Bush administration. But the administration's new approach, one that garnered so much praise and so much criticism, was less transformative than contemporaries thought. Much of it was consistent with long-term trends in U.S. foreign policy, and much has been continued by President Barack Obama. Some aspects merit the scorn often heaped on them; other aspects merit praise that was only grudging in the moment. Wherever one positions oneself, it is time to place the era in context and assess it as judiciously as possible.

**BEFORE AND AFTER**

Before 9/11, the Bush administration had focused its foreign policy attention on China and Russia; on determining whether a Middle East peace settlement was in the cards; on building a ballistic missile defense system; and on contemplating how to deal with ""rogue"" states such as Iran, Iraq, Libya, and North Korea. At many meetings of the National Security Council, officials debated the pros and cons of a new sanctions regime against Saddam Hussein's dictatorial government in Baghdad; they also discussed what would be done if U.S. planes enforcing the no-fly zones over Iraq were shot down. Little was agreed on.

Top officials did not consider terrorism or radical Islamism a high priority. Richard Clarke, the chief counterterrorism expert on the National Security Council staff, might hector them relentlessly about the imminence of the threat, and CIA Director George Tenet might say the lights were blinking red. But Secretary of State Colin Powell, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, and National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice were not convinced. Nor was Bush. In August 2001, he went to his ranch for a long vacation. Osama bin Laden was not his overriding concern.

Bush's foreign policy and defense advisers were trying to define a strategic framework and adapt U.S. armed forces to the so-called revolution in military affairs. The president himself was beginning to speak more about free trade and remaking U.S. foreign aid. During the presidential campaign, he had talked about both a humbler foreign policy and a reinvigorated defense establishment; how he was going to reconcile those goals was still unclear. But in truth, the president's focus was elsewhere, on the domestic arena -- tax cuts, education reform, faith-based voluntarism, energy policy. And then, suddenly, disaster struck.

In response to the attacks, the administration launched a ""global war on terror."" It chose to focus not on al Qaeda alone but on the worldwide terrorist threat more generally. And it targeted not only deadly nonstate actors but also the regimes that harbored and succored them. To extract actionable intelligence, it resorted to detention, rendition, and, in a few cases, torture.

The administration announced that it was adopting a policy of anticipatory self-defense -- essentially, preventive warfare. Bush declared that he would take action to preclude not only imminent threats but also gathering ones, and would act alone if necessary. This approach led eventually to war not only in Afghanistan but in Iraq as well.

The administration also emphasized democratization and the notion of a democratic peace. These became key ingredients of the Bush doctrine, especially after weapons of mass destruction (WMD) were not found in Iraq. ""We are led by events and common sense to one conclusion,"" Bush said in his second inaugural address, in January 2005. ""The survival of liberty in our land depends on the success of liberty in other lands."" Three years after that, as she was about to leave office, Rice also presented this position, saying that she and her colleagues had come to recognize ""that democratic state-building is now an urgent component of our national interest.""

After 9/11, there was an accelerated buildup of U.S. military and intelligence capabilities. Defense expenditures skyrocketed; counterinsurgency initiatives proliferated; new bases were constructed throughout Central and Southwest Asia; a new military command in Africa was established. The war on terror became the preoccupation of the Bush administration's national security policy.

Alongside its security policies, the administration embraced free markets, trade liberalization, and economic development. It reconfigured and hugely augmented the United States' foreign aid commitments, increasing economic assistance, for example, from about $13 billion in 2000 to about $34 billion in 2008. The administration fought disease, becoming the largest donor to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. It negotiated a deal reducing strategic warheads with Russia, reconfigured the United States' relationship with India, and smoothed over its rocky start with China. And it continued to try to thwart the proliferation of WMD while forging ahead with its work on a ballistic missile defense system. These efforts complemented each other, as the administration was intent on not allowing the proliferation of WMD to stymie its freedom of action in regions deemed important. Nor did it wish to risk the possibility that rogue states might give or sell WMD to terrorists.

Most of these policies -- preemption (really prevention), unilateralism, military supremacy, democratization, free trade, economic growth, alliance cohesion, and great-power partnerships -- were outlined in the administration's 2002 National Security Strategy, a document composed not in the Office of the Vice President or the Pentagon by neoconservatives but in the office of then National Security Adviser Rice, largely by Philip Zelikow, an outside consultant, and revised by Rice and her aides before being edited by Bush himself.

September 11, in short, galvanized the Bush administration and prompted it to shift its focus. Fear inspired action, as did a sense of U.S. power, a pride in national institutions and values, a feeling of responsibility for the safety of the public, and a sense of guilt over having allowed the country to be struck. As the White House adviser Karl Rove would write, ""We worked to numb ourselves to the fact of an attack on American soil that involved the death of thousands."" Reshaping U.S. policy after 9/11 meant resolving the ambiguities and shattering the paralysis that had marked the first nine months of the administration. Before 9/11, the United States' primacy and security had been taken for granted; after 9/11, Washington had to make clear that it could protect the U.S. homeland, defend its allies, oversee an open world economy, and propagate its institutions.

**AMERICA'S QUEST FOR PRIMACY**

Some observers have compared the impact of 9/11 on U.S. policy to the impact on U.S. policy of North Korea's attack on South Korea in June 1950. Back then, the Truman administration had also been stunned. It had been pondering new initiatives, but the president was still waffling. He had approved the National Security Council report known as NSC-68 but was not quite ready to implement it. The dimensions of a coming U.S. military buildup were uncertain; the global nature of the Cold War still unclear; the ideological crusade still somewhat inchoate. But Dean Acheson, the secretary of state, and Paul Nitze, the director of policy planning at the State Department, knew they had to reconfirm the United States' preponderance of power, recently shattered by the Soviets' first nuclear test. They knew they had to increase the United States' military capabilities, regain the country's self-confidence, and avoid being self-deterred. They knew they had to take responsibility for the operation of global free trade and the reconstruction of the West German and Japanese economies (their successful resuscitation was still uncertain). They knew the United States' supremacy was being contested by a brutal and formidable rival with an ideology that had considerable appeal to impoverished peoples beginning to yearn for autonomy, equality, independence, and nationhood. In this context, the North Korean attack not only led to the Korean War but also unleashed a major expansion of U.S. global policy more generally.

Whether or not one thinks that such analogies are appropriate, it is incontestable that Bush and his advisers saw themselves as being locked in a similar struggle. And they, too, sought to preserve and reassert the primacy of the United States while they struggled to thwart any follow-up attacks on U.S. citizens or U.S. territory. Like Acheson and Nitze, they were certain that they were protecting a way of life, that the configuration of power in the international arena and the mitigation of threats abroad were vital to the preservation of freedom at home.

More than Acheson and Nitze, Bush's advisers had trouble weaving the elements of their policy into a coherent strategy that could address the challenges they considered most urgent. It seems clear now that many of their foreign policy initiatives, along with their tax cuts and unwillingness to call for domestic sacrifices, undercut the very goals they were designed to achieve.

Thus, U.S. primacy was ultimately damaged by the failure to execute the occupations in Afghanistan and Iraq effectively and by the anti-Americanism that these flawed enterprises helped magnify. U.S. officials might declare the universal appeal of freedom and proclaim that history has demonstrated the viability of only one form of political economy, but opinion polls throughout the Muslim world have shown that the United States' actions in Iraq and support of Israel were a toxic combination. As liberation turned into occupation and counterinsurgency, the United States and its power were thrown into disrepute.

U.S. primacy was also damaged by the unexpected cost of the protracted wars, recently estimated by the Congressional Research Service to be $1.3 trillion dollars and mounting. It was eroded by the debts that accrued as a result of tax cuts and increased domestic expenditures. Defense spending climbed from $304 billion in 2001 to $616 billion in 2008, even as the U.S. budget went from a surplus of $128 billion to a deficit of $458 billion. Federal debt as a percentage of GDP rose from 32.5 percent in 2001 to 53.5 percent in 2009. Meanwhile, the U.S. debt held by foreign governments climbed steadily, from about 13 percent at the end of the Cold War to close to 30 percent at the end of the Bush years. U.S. financial strength and flexibility had been seriously eroded.

Rather than preventing peer competitors from rising, the United States' interventions abroad and budgetary and economic woes at home put Washington at a growing disadvantage vis-à-vis its rivals, most notably Beijing. While U.S. forces were bogged down in Southwest Asia, China's growing military capabilities, especially its new class of submarines and its new cruise and ballistic missiles, endangered the United States' supremacy in East and Southeast Asia. Meanwhile, the U.S. trade deficit with China rose from $83 billion in 2001 to $273 billion in 2010, and total U.S. indebtedness to China rose from $78 billion in 2001 to over $1.1 trillion in 2011.

Rather than preserving regional balances, U.S. actions upset the balance in the region that U.S. officials cared most about, the Persian Gulf and the Middle East more generally. The United States' credibility in the region withered, Iraq was largely eliminated as a counterbalance to Iran, Iran's ability to meddle beyond its borders increased, and the United States' ability to mediate Israeli-Palestinian negotiations declined.

Rather than thwarting proliferation, U.S. interventions on behalf of regime change provided additional incentives for rogue nations to pursue WMD. Iranian and North Korean leaders seem to have calculated that, more than ever before, their countries' survival depended on possessing a WMD deterrent (a message that has probably been reinforced by the Obama administration's decision to intervene in Libya in 2011 following Libya's renunciation of its nuclear capability several years earlier).

Rather than promoting free markets, U.S. economic woes spurred protectionist impulses at home and complicated trade negotiations abroad. Efforts to expedite the Doha Round of trade talks faltered, and bilateral trade agreements with Colombia and South Korea stalled.

Rather than promoting liberty, the war on terror coexisted with democratic backsliding globally (at least until the recent Arab Spring). U.S. war fighting and counterterrorism nurtured Washington's unsavory relationships with some of the world's most illiberal regimes, such as those in Saudi Arabia, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan. According to Freedom House's 2010 annual report on the state of global political rights and civil liberties, ""2009 was the fourth straight year in which more countries saw declines in freedom than saw improvements, the longest continuous period of deterioration in the nearly forty year history of the report.""

And rather than thwarting terrorism and radical Islamism, U.S. actions encouraged them. During the war on terror, the number of terrorist incidents rose, and possibly so did the number of jihadists. The U.S. government's own National Intelligence Estimate in 2007 acknowledged that the country lived in a heightened threat environment. A 2008 report on counterterrorism from a respected nonpartisan think tank, the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, concluded, ""Since 2002-3, the overall US position in the GWOT [global war on terror] has slipped."" Although the United States had captured and killed terrorist leaders and operatives, disrupted terrorist networks, seized assets, and built constructive partnerships with counterterrorist agencies abroad, it noted, the gains had been ""offset by the metastasis of the al Qaeda organization into a global movement, the spread and intensification of Salafi-Jihadi ideology, the resurgence of Iranian regional influence, and the growth in the number and political influence of Islamic fundamentalist political parties throughout the world."" It is possible that the recent killing of bin Laden will reverse these trends, but many leading experts are skeptical.

Criticism is, of course, easy in hindsight. After 9/11, U.S. officials confronted agonizing challenges and choices. In an atmosphere of extreme fear and real danger, their record included important accomplishments and admirable initiatives. They kept pressure on al Qaeda and other terrorist organizations and may well have prevented other attacks on U.S. soil and citizens. They pulled off a major nonproliferation success in getting Libya to abandon its nuclear program, formed a strong relationship with rising powers such as India, and kept relations with China and Russia from boiling over. They reformed and reinvigorated foreign aid, exerted global leadership in the fight against infectious diseases, tried to keep the Doha Round of trade talks moving forward, and raised the profile of democracy promotion and political reform in ways that may have resonated deeply and contributed to the current ferment across the Middle East.

These successes were outweighed by the administration's failure to achieve many of its most important goals. But critics are wrong to say that the policies that failed were radically new or surprising. They were rooted in the past.

**9/11 IN HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE**

Preemptive and preventive actions were not invented by Bush; his vice president, Dick Cheney; and Rumsfeld; they have a long history in the annals of U.S. foreign policy. A century earlier, President Theodore Roosevelt's ""corollary"" to the Monroe Doctrine was a policy of preventive intervention in the Americas, as were the subsequent U.S. military occupations of countries such as Haiti and the Dominican Republic. Later, President Franklin Roosevelt justified his resort to anticipatory self-defense against German ships in the Atlantic prior to the United States' entry into World War II by saying, ""When you see a rattlesnake poised to strike, you do not wait until he has struck before you crush him."" Some 20 years on, President John F. Kennedy determined that he could not allow a Soviet deployment of offensive weapons about 90 miles from U.S. shores, and he unilaterally imposed a quarantine -- essentially a blockade and an act of belligerency -- around Cuba during the missile crisis. In Kennedy's view, this was a legitimate preventive step, notwithstanding the fact that it brought the country to the brink of nuclear war. Responding to the threat of terrorism in the mid-1990s, President Bill Clinton signed a national security directive declaring that ""the United States shall pursue vigorously efforts to deter and preempt, apprehend and prosecute ... individuals who perpetrate or plan to perpetrate such attacks."" The Roosevelts, Kennedy, and Clinton, along with most of their presidential colleagues, would have agreed with the statement in Bush's 2002 National Security Strategy, which could have been referring to any impending threat, that ""history will judge harshly those who saw this coming danger but failed to act. In the new world we have entered, the only path to safety is the path of action.""

Bush and his advisers, moreover, were hardly alone in seeking regime change abroad in the wake of 9/11. Two weeks after the president's ""axis of evil"" speech in January 2002, former Vice President Al Gore declared, ""There really is something to be said for occasionally putting diplomacy aside and laying one's cards on the table. There is value in calling evil by its name."" He continued, ""Even if we give first priority to the destruction of terrorist networks, and even if we succeed, there are still governments that could bring great harm. And there is a clear case that one of those governments in particular represents a virulent threat in a class to itself: Iraq. . . . A final reckoning with that government should be on the table."" A few days later, then Senator Joe Biden interrupted Powell as he was testifying before Congress. ""One way or another,"" Biden said, ""Saddam has got to go, and it is likely to be required to have U.S. force to have him go, and the question is how to do it in my view, not if to do it."" Two days later, Sandy Berger, who had been Clinton's national security adviser, insisted in his own testimony that although each part of the axis of evil was an unmistakable danger, Saddam was especially pernicious and ominous, saying that he ""was, is, and continues to be a menace to his people, to the region, and to us."" Berger continued: ""He cannot be accommodated. Our goal should be regime change. The question is not whether, but how and when."" And Clinton himself subsequently explained why he supported his successor's decision to invade Iraq: ""There was a lot of stuff [WMD] unaccounted for. . . . You couldn't responsibly ignore [the possibility that] a tyrant had these stocks. I never really thought he'd [use them]. What I was far more worried about was that he he'd sell this stuff or give it away.""

Conventional wisdom says that Democratic officials might have acted differently after 9/11, and it seems likely that they would have worked more diligently to cooperate with allies in Europe. But the Bush administration's use of force to bring about regime change in countries perceived to be threatening in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks comported with what most Americans believed to be desirable at the time. The administration's military buildup, meanwhile, was neither especially bold nor unprecedented. Its quest to avoid peer competitors resembled the U.S. effort to preserve an atomic monopoly after World War II, achieve military preponderance in the wake of the Korean War, preserve military superiority during the Kennedy years, regain superiority during the Reagan years, and nurture unipolarity after the Soviet Union's collapse. Clinton's Joint Chiefs of Staff embraced the term ""full-spectrum superiority"" to describe the country's strategic intentions. It was during the Clinton years, not the Bush years, that the United States started spending more money on defense than virtually all other nations combined. Scholars and practitioners as varied as Andrew Bacevich, Eric Edelman, John Mearsheimer, and Paul Wolfowitz see more continuity than difference in the strategic goals and military practices of all the post-Cold War administrations.

The similarities extend to rhetorical tropes and ideological aspirations as well. It has become fashionable in some circles to excoriate the ideological fervor of the Bush team. But the affirmation of democratic values was hardly new. It was integral to the Wilsonian and Achesonian visions of the world, if not that of Henry Kissinger and President Richard Nixon. One should recall Kennedy addressing the people of Berlin or launching the Alliance for Progress, President Lyndon Johnson explaining U.S. actions in Vietnam, President Jimmy Carter talking about human rights, and President Ronald Reagan extolling the U.S. role in the world. Their rhetorical tropes resemble Bush's, as do Obama's in his recent speeches. And like his predecessors (and his successor), Bush had little trouble deviating from this message when it suited his administration's strategic or material interests.

Many argue that U.S. policy after 9/11 was distinguished by its unilateralism. But the instinct to act independently, and to lead the world while doing so, is consonant with the long history of U.S. diplomacy, dating back to President George Washington's Farewell Address and President Thomas Jefferson's first inaugural speech. During the Cold War, U.S. officials always reserved the right to act unilaterally, even while they nurtured alliances. Clinton's last National Security Strategy, and Obama's first, explicitly did the same. There is little doubt that Bush's advisers, inspired by fear and hubris as well as a sense of responsibility and pangs of guilt, had a greater propensity to act unilaterally than did their Democratic predecessors or successors. But at the same time, they also articulated a desire to strengthen alliances, a goal that was pursued to some good effect after 2005.

Bush is linked even more closely to those who came before and after by his embrace of the open door policy and global free trade. His 2002 National Security Strategy, famous for jettisoning containment and deterrence and embracing anticipatory self-defense, also contained long sections dealing with promoting global economic growth, nurturing free markets, opening societies, and building the infrastructure of democracy. These U.S. policies have a long heritage, dating back to the ""open door notes"" of Secretary of State John Hay, President Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen Points, and Franklin Roosevelt's Atlantic Charter, and they have been a staple of many more recent, if less memorable, statements by Clinton and Obama.

**GRAPPLING WITH TRAGEDY**

The long-term significance of 9/11 for U.S. foreign policy, therefore, should not be overestimated. The attacks that day were a terrible tragedy, an unwarranted assault on innocent civilians, and a provocation of monumental proportions. But they did not change the world or transform the long-term trajectory of U.S. grand strategy. The United States' quest for primacy, its desire to lead the world, its preference for an open door and free markets, its concern with military supremacy, its readiness to act unilaterally when deemed necessary, its eclectic merger of interests and values, its sense of indispensability -- all these remained, and remain, unchanged.

What the attacks did do was alter the United States' threat perception and highlight the global significance of nonstate actors and radical Islamism. They alerted the country to the fragility of its security and the anger, bitterness, and resentment toward the United States residing elsewhere, particularly in parts of the Islamic world. But if 9/11 highlighted vulnerabilities, its aftermath illustrated how the mobilization of U.S. power, unless disciplined, calibrated, and done in conjunction with allies, has the potential to undermine the global commons as well as to protect them.

Rather than heaping blame or casting praise on the Bush administration, ten years after 9/11 it is time for Americans to reflect more deeply about their history and their values. Americans can affirm their core values yet recognize the hubris that inheres in them. They can identify the wanton brutality of others yet acknowledge that they themselves are the source of rage in many parts of the Arab world. Americans can agree that terrorism is a threat that must be addressed but realize that it is not an existential menace akin to the military and ideological challenges posed by German Nazism and Soviet communism. They can acknowledge that the practice of projecting solutions to their problems onto the outside world means that they seek to avoid difficult choices at home, such as paying higher taxes, accepting universal conscription, or implementing a realistic energy policy. Americans can recognize that there is evil in the world, as Obama reminded his Nobel audience in December 2009, and they can admit, as he did, that force has a vital role to play in the affairs of humankind. But they can also recognize that the exercise of power can grievously injure those whom they wish to help and can undercut the very goals they seek to achieve. Americans can acknowledge the continuities in their interests and values yet wrestle with the judgments and tradeoffs that are required to design a strategy that works in a post-Cold War era, where the threats are more varied, the enemies more elusive, and power more fungible.

The bitterness that has poisoned American public discourse in the wake of the 9/11 attacks and the wars they triggered should be turned into sorrowful reflection about how fear, guilt, hubris, and power can do so much harm in the quest to do good.

It looks interesting and he appears to be well-respected, but most of the good reviews are by people who fill their posts with disparaging remarks about ""the left."" Similarly, the bad reviews argue that this is just ""right-wing propaganda.""

I could probably get another book by someone on the other side, say Paul Krugman, and just read both, but I imagine that both books will be filled with similarly convincing statistics each appearing to refute the other's premises and arguments.

I'm an aspiring medical scientist, and I really appreciate the value of understanding exactly what we know and why we know it (and perhaps most importantly what we don't yet know for sure) so that I can make rational informed choices that have the highest probability of being correct. I understand the incredible difficulty in positively identifying causation above and beyond correlation in medicine, and I'm sure it's even harder in sociology and economics.

Pundits and bloggers on both sides of economic issues always seem to just state their claims as if they're the most obvious thing in the world and the other guys are clearly dishonest and have no leg to stand on, and I just don't know who to trust. With no formal education in economics, I have no way of telling who is lying and taking things out of context, and who is earnestly trying to follow the data where it leads and do whatever really seems most likely to be in the best interest of our future as a society and species.

I wish it were as easy as studying creationism vs. evolution, where a cursory understanding of the basic science involved reveals one of them to be clearly fraudulent and very much using a ""conclusion first"" approach to the issue. Maybe it is and I just don't have a good enough understanding of economics, but I doubt it since it doesn't seem like professional economists have anywhere approaching the same degree of concurrence as scientists do on other politicized issues like climate change and evolution.

I'm Serbian. I used to be a nationalist myself but at the age of 17-18-19 I started to read more, think more and as I moved away from our Serbian church/faith, from homophobia, from the ""Serbs never did nothing wrong, everyone of our allies (US, France etc) turned on us for defending ourselves"" attitude etc I naturally moved away from nationalism as well, since there was almost nothing left I could agree with the rest of them.

Since then I've been attacked because of that, because I don't shy away from saying that ""No, I'm not a Serbian nationalist"" and those attacks, because they were so ""matter of fact"", because people, including my friends, my mother, told me ""Well you have to stand with your people"" like it's some obvious cosmic rule got me thinking….

Why the fuck do I have to ""stand"" with some group, with whom I share more less no ideals, no beliefs, no nothing just because my great great great…..something and all of theirs great great great great something came down from the same Ural mountains to the Balkans in the freaking 6th century? 

Why is that so important, why does that by some default force me to defend something that I don't think should be defended. 

I am first of all a man, my own person, after that I am my parents child and my wives husband etc etc etc, Serb would come at number 5 or 6 on that list.

If I ""stand by someone"" I will stand by him because he/she is a good person. I will not stand by someone just because we might have similar DNK, I will stand by someone if we share ideals and ideas. 

And that thought of mine how ""I will stand by someone with whom I share ideals and ideas"" got me thinking about the US.

Isn't that was basically Americans are? You guys have no ""common history"" (at least not in a way other nations do) no bloodline to connect you. You have ideals and ideas of what America is. It changes, evolves over time but even now, what, 200 and something years later the core is the same. Which would also, IMO, explain (not justify, just help me understand more) your, lets call it ""overreaction"" when it came to communists in the 50's when compared to other NATO countries.

A frenchman is a frenchman whatever he chooses to be politically. No one can tell me that I'm not  a Serbian, my bloodline can be traced centuries back, but if an American doesn't share that ideals and ideas of America what makes him American exactly? The territory he lives in, the passport he has? 

Again, I'm not accusing anyone, I'm just ""thinking out loud"", the witch hunt on communists, putting Americans of japanese origin in camps during WW II are terrible, terrible things…and I would never dare to justify something like that. Things like that are exactly what made me revalue my ""connection"" with my fellow Serbs. 

I'm just, as the title says, thinking about nationalism in general and besides that American nationalism, it is different, isn't it?

Thus the living wage- the lower bound of what it takes to survive in an area with a certain cost of living. It is difficult to calculate, but conveys how some cities require not only more than the minimum wage, but a substantial increase. I myself has seen (non-objective, anecdotal) cases in the expensive area where I live. A friend I met recently worked for $13.50 an hour, but was homeless as there is not property remotely close to his workplace that can be rented with that wage.

To use a few examples of popular claims:

 * An increase in systemic corruption
 * A decrease in popular activism
 * An unwillingness to pay taxes or take cuts in the interest of civic well-being
 * A fading middle class
 * Some insuperable economic hurdle (eg from globalization, environmental damage, energy, etc)
 * Some form of moral decay

It's not hard to find doom-sayers. They range from your Noam Chomsky's to your Rocky Anderson's, your Elizabeth Warren's to your Glenn Beck's, your Jared Diamond's to your Ron Paul's, along with a ton of no-names like John Greer and Dan Carlin.

Personally, I find it very difficult to suss out whether the United States is actually ""in decline"" in any determinable sense. History shows people of many eras preached that corruption, indifference, decadence, and poverty were eating away at their societies. They were usually wrong. On the other hand, they've sometimes been right, as students of late antiquity and late feudalism could affirm.

The first thing to keep in mind is that downvoting on r/NeutralPolitics should be extremely rare. Even if you dislike someone’s post or disagree with it, please reserve downvotes for posts that are explicitly breaking subreddit rules. I will repeat, **do not downvote someone simply because you disagree with them**. Also, never downvote evidence unless you have a defensible reason to believe that the evidence is false.

Remember: we all have reasons that we are putting forth our respective arguments, and if another poster’s argument seems tenuous or poorly explained, please engage them in discussion rather than simply downvoting. By doing so, you are giving them a chance either to explain themselves better or realize that they might be making false assumptions. Through this positive engagement, the conversation can be mutually beneficial and provide an example for others to follow.

If you do downvote a post or comment, we ask that you leave a response specifically explaining the flaws that you identified in it. Don’t be rude, as some people won’t know that they are doing something wrong. If that is the case, point them in the direction of the FAQ so that they can educate themselves. Be constructive about it. Yes, they should have read it already, but not everyone will. You never know, your post might inspire them to be a positive member of the community. 

Sometimes, however, downvoting *is* appropriate. These cases are as follows:

* Flaming
* Memes, spam, or posts that are otherwise devoid of meaningful content
* Off-topic responses that are clearly trying to derail the conversation

The general idea is that only posts that need to be reported deserve to be downvoted. Instead, focus on upvoting exemplary posts so that they can rise to the top.

*Which brings us to our second topic…*


**Upvoting**

Where there is legitimate evidence, solid reasoning, or respectful discourse, there should be upvotes. Upvote content that you think promotes civil and intelligent discussion. Upvote redditors who are engaging in a debate that provides a positive example for the community. Upvote someone admitting that they are wrong. Upvote outstanding use of logic where evidence can’t be had.

Be liberal with your upvotes as long as the posts deserve them. By providing this positive feedback, you reinforce the behaviors that we want to see on this subreddit.

In [Affordable Excellence: The Singapore Healthcare Story] (http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/Press/Books/2013/affordableexcellence/AffordableExcellencePDF.pdf) William A. Haseltine explaines why 
&gt;Singapore has achieved extraordinary results both in the high quality of its healthcare system and in controlling the cost of care. In per capita terms and as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), its healthcare expenditures are the lowest of all the high-income countries in the world.  
   
Hasseltine’s book mentions an essential White Paper issued in 1993 by a ministerial committee entitled [“Aﬀordable Health Care.”] (http://www.moh.gov.sg/content/dam/moh_web/Publications/Reports/1993/Affordable_Health_Care.pdf) which set forth ﬁve fundamental elements of Singaporean medical policy:  

&gt; 1 Become a healthy nation by promoting good health;  
 
This means that the Singapore government is very engaged in disease prevention and actively promotes a healthy lifestyle.  

&gt; 2 Promote individual responsibility for one’s own health and avoid overreliance on state welfare or third-party medical insurance;  
 
[Medisafe] (http://www.moh.gov.sg/content/moh_web/home/costs_and_financing/schemes_subsidies/medisave.html) is a mandatory medical saving scheme that is central to keeping medical cost down by making Singaporeans pay for their own healthcare costs and that of their family while providing guidelines on what the medisafe funds can be used for.  

&gt; 3 Ensure good and aﬀordable basic medical services for all Singaporeans;  
  
The government provides a basic medical package that is available for all Singaporeans and provided by hospitals receiving subsidies.  

&gt; 4 Engage competition and market forces to improve service and raise eﬃciency;  
  
[econlog:] (http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2008/01/singapores_heal.html)
&gt; - ""The private healthcare system competes with the public healthcare, which helps contain prices in both directions. Private medical insurance is also available.""  

&gt; - Private healthcare providers are required to publish price lists to encourage comparison shopping.   

&gt; 5 Intervene directly in the healthcare sector when necessary, where the 
market fails to keep healthcare costs down.  
 
The Singaporean government tries to prevent oversupply because apparently too much competition actually drives costs up.  
The government introduced several additional saving schemes, examples are [Medishield] (http://www.moh.gov.sg/content/moh_web/home/costs_and_financing/schemes_subsidies/Medishield.html) and [Medifund] (http://www.moh.gov.sg/content/moh_web/home/costs_and_financing/schemes_subsidies/Medifund.html).  

It is my opinion that this whitepaper can provide a blueprint for improving other healthcare systems as well. What do you think?

My question is should these be used to rate schools/teachers/students? Funding for American schools depends, in part, on their performance on standardized tests. This results in schools with higher performance getting more money and schools with lower performance getting less money. But often times schools with lower performance need more money in order to get resources for their students to improve.

It also forces a very specific curriculum on teachers, forcing them to ""teach to the test.""

Teachers have also been rated based on their students' performance on standardized tests. In some instances, they receive bonuses based on how well the students perform. However, Freakonomics described how teachers would cheat for their students in order to get the bonus.

Students are also rated based on standardized tests. SAT and ACT scores often determine whether a student gets into a particular university as well as scholarships. The ROTC programs have a ACT requirement that disqualifies students if they have too low of a score. Some argue that ACT/SAT/standardized tests in general don't accurately measure a student's ability to perform, but rather how well they can answer a very specific set of questions.

Should standardized tests be kept as a method of rating schools/teachers/students? Should it be used for rating some not other others? What are the alternatives to standardized testing and what are their advantages?

commercialization and other specifically enumerated activities and requirements, including measures designed to mitigate or minimize potential adverse environmental effects, if any, relevant to the Secretary’s evaluation of the petition for non-regulated status, while ensuring that growers or other users are able to move, plant, cultivate, introduce into commerce and carry out other authorized activities in a timely manner: Provided, That all such conditions shall be applicable only for the interim period necessary for the Secretary to complete any required analyses or consultations related

This is probably the single most controversial theoretical issue in politics today, underlying a whole host of other policy arguments.

So the buzz-term ""welfare queen"" has been making the rounds again, and I'm wondering if there is any true legitimacy to the term.

Do ""welfare queens"" actually exist? If so, how many of them are there? How much do they actually cost us? I've never seen any trustworthy or verifiable statistics on this.

I'll keep mulling this over but I think it's probably not a good discussion topic for the above reasons. I mean, you're all welcome to have at it, but I understand the limitations of the initial question. Cheers.**


First off, here are the sources for the figures in the title:

[2011 Plastic Surgery 
Statistics Report (PDF)](http://www.plasticsurgery.org/Documents/news-resources/statistics/2011-statistics/2011_Stats_Quick_Facts.pdf)

[Section 3.2 of the World Malaria Report (PDF)](http://www.who.int/malaria/world_malaria_report_2011/WMR2011_chapter3.pdf)

So five times as much was spent on elective, cosmetic plastic surgery in just one country than was contributed by all of the countries of the world to the fight against Malaria. I was not born yesterday. I understand how this situation arises. There's simply *not* a lot of money in mosquito netting and vaccines for third-world countries and there *is* a lot of money in Beverly Hills for plastic surgeons.

My question is, **what are some of the best ways that we could re-prioritize thinking about healthcare to better allocate resources to where they are most needed, not just where the most dollars are?** What are the most effective ways to accomplish this at the governmental level? Obviously there are disagreements about fairness whenever governments get involved with income redistribution but I'm interested to hear people's perspectives on this.

Also, I'm aware that philanthropic organizations like the Gates Foundation are picking up some of the slack and doing some amazing things but it's clear that even more could be done and many more lives could be saved.

And finally, I'm American and I personally am not proud of my country's healthcare system but I also would like this to be more of a constructive discussion of what could be done in America and worldwide, rather than just bashing the way things currently are. I know that a neutral, thoughtful discussion can happen in this sub and that's why I like it here!

I figured this might be a better place to discuss the pros and cons than /r/politics would be.

Some of the points I've been considering (I haven't made my mind up how I feel about them):

- Term limits would seem to limit the experience our representatives have with the legislative process... they'd have to learn the ropes afresh every term, make connections, etc, afresh every term, in effect. This seems like it would make things pretty inefficient. This could be good or bad, I suppose.

- Lobbyists have no term limits and setting term limits on representatives makes lobbyists the people in Washington with the most experience / tenure. Seems like this would not be great, on the face of it. I am sure there is more complexity to it than that.

- Freedom of speech: if people like their representative, shouldn't they be able to keep them?

- Term limits might also make it easier to get rid of entrenched corruption, but that cuts both ways.

- If people want to vote out senators they don't like, they are free to do so. Is there a need for a term limit to do it for them?

- I recognize that the legislative and executive branches are, and are meant to be, quite different, but I'm not sure I fully support presidential term limits either. Same basic reasoning.

Anyway, these are just a few of the factors I've been mulling over. I am not really completely sold on anything, but I guess I'd be leaning toward ""no term limits.""

So this time I'll start by citing a PDF which has a lot of sources listed and a lot of hard data and facts.  I will admit that this data is cherry picked in order to paint a positive view of concealed carry and it's effect on crime.

http://concealedcampus.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2011/12/ccw_gun_facts.pdf

I think the most important things to note from that are that states which enacted concealed carry laws saw their crime rates drop faster than they had been dropping, and faster than the national average.  At least in some states there seems to be enough evidence that concealed carry is strongly correlated with decreased crime rates.

The other important information is that concealed carriers are relatively unlikely to commit crimes compared with the general population.  The tiny number of CCW permits which have been revoked are a good measurement of how often concealed carriers commit crimes, since most serious crimes lead to revocation of a CCW permit.

It also dispels some common myths with evidence, such as the idea that concealed carry will lead to mass public shootings, and that most police are against the idea of concealed carry by civilians.

[Here](http://www.sj-r.com/top-stories/x1526463189/Concealed-carry-laws-Experts-debate-impact?zc_p=0) is an article discussing one of the most commonly cited studies that determined that concealed carry laws decrease crime rates, with criticisms of both sides.  This shows a little about how impossible it is to ever be certain that statistics show causation and not simply correlation.

For the people who claim that other countries with strict gun control prove that allowing civilians to own and carry guns increases crime, I have some powerful statistics for you.  A recent study, written about in [this article](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/7922755/England-has-worse-crime-rate-than-the-US-says-Civitas-study.html) shows that England has the highest level of violent crime in Europe, and an even higher rate than the US, despite their strict gun control laws.  I am aware England's homicide rate is much lower than the US rate, but that has always been that way, even before England banned handguns.  I claim that the difference in homicide and crime rates are due mainly to cultural differences, and not to gun control laws.

We can also look at examples from other nations, comparing their [international homicide rate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate)  Of note is Switzerland, with a high gun ownership rate, and a mandate that every able bodied male keep a fully automatic military rifle in their home as a part of mandatory military duty.  They have a very low homicide rate, of between .6 and 1, while the UK is at 1.23 in the most recent data, and the US is at 4.8.  Compare that with a country like Mexico, which has some of the most strict gun control laws in the world, and you see they have a rate of 18.  This goes to show that sometimes gun control laws are ineffective, and despite there being almost no legal civilian gun ownership in Mexico there are still a lot of firearms there, and a lot of homicide.

So in conclusion, like I said there is a lot of data, with a lot of variables, from a lot of different countries with widely different cultures and laws.  In general I don't think I can make many conclusions about how concealed carry laws would impact nations other than the US, but I think there is enough data to claim that concealed carry laws in the US are correlated with a decrease in crime rates.  Whether or not that translates similarly to other countries is impossible to determine based on my current knowledge.  I do think there is good evidence that England hasn't benefited greatly from their gun ban, and their country wouldn't fall apart if they did legalize concealed carry, but i'll leave that to the Brits to decide.",,False,,t5_2tk0i,False,,,True,t3_pzzj1,http://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/pzzj1/does_concealed_carry_of_guns_lead_to_less_crime/,

1372478328.0,48,self.NeutralPolitics,1hakv3,"Climate change policy, specifically a carbon tax",61,13,36,http://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/1hakv3/climate_change_policy_specifically_a_carbon_tax/,"I'd like to discuss the best policies to address the reality of climate change. If possible, I'd like to bypass the conversation about whether or not climate change is happening (it is) and if humans are a significant cause (we are). I'd instead like to focus on the policy options to address it -- either prevention or adaptation.

My understanding is that there is universal understanding among economists that a carbon tax is the most efficient -- i.e., least expensive -- way to address this problem. It is unpopular, however, and therefore faces political problems. As a result, American politicians tend to favor ""command and control"" policies (i.e., fuel efficiency standards, pollution standards) that hide the costs of regulation but are ultimately more expensive. This is because they force companies to make inefficient trades, have perverse effects that increase emissions, and add regulatory burden. Therefore if we were to institute a carbon tax, we could achieve the same regulatory goals and actually help the economy.

I believe that the popular objections to a carbon tax (economic cost, regressivity) are misguided or easily solved. As I outlined above, the economic cost of a carbon tax is more visible, which is a problem politically, but it is actually better for the economy than alternative regulations. Regressivity is easily addressed by increasing support for low-income households. Generally, a small percentage of total revenue is necessary to offset the effects for poor households.

The only other alternative is not addressing the problem with any policy, and instead focusing on adaptation. All the economic studies I've seen suggest that the cost of not doing anything far exceeds the costs of addressing climate change, so long as this is done intelligently.

**MY OPINION:** It also seems to me that the risks are extremely serious that if climate change hits 4 degrees C we could see failing crops, mass migration, etc. from already-poor areas of the world that could be much more de-stabilizing to civilization than these estimates account for. Previous episodes of more modest climate change have literally led to the collapse of civilizations.

    * America’s plans look worryingly like an energy-policy grab-bag in which the president has been rummaging, rather than an efficient carbon-cutting plan.
    * The right thing in climate policy for all the big countries is a carbon tax, which is simpler and less vulnerable to fluctuations in emissions than cap-and-trade schemes. For years, such a tax has been a non-starter politically. But as the alternatives are tested to destruction, it deserves to be looked at again.

    * I am convinced by the environmental case for a carbon tax. But I want to make a broader argument: a carbon tax could be an engine for tax simplification, deficit reduction, less government regulation and even increased competitiveness.
    * Adele Morris at the Brookings Institution estimates that diverting just 15 percent of the revenues from a $16-per-ton carbon tax would provide enough money to keep low-income households whole. The remaining money could be used to finance a substantial reduction in corporate tax rates and reduce deficits by $815 billion over 20 years. Government spending would not increase.
    * Economists have long contended that a carbon tax is the most effective and simplest way to reduce carbon emissions.

    * America and its political leaders, after two decades of failing to come together to solve big problems, seem to have lost faith in their ability to do so. A political system that expects failure doesn’t try very hard to produce anything else.” That’s us today — our entire political system is guilty of the “soft bigotry of low expectations” for ourselves. I raise this now because it strikes me as crazy that one of the obvious solutions to our budget, energy and environmental problems — the one that would be the least painful and have the best long-term impact (a carbon tax) — is off the table. Meanwhile, the solution that is as dumb as the day is long — a budget sequester that slashes spending indiscriminately — is on the table.

  * [IMF Fact Sheet on Climate Change](http://www.imf.org/external/np/exr/facts/enviro.htm)
    * Broad-based charges on greenhouse gas emissions are the most effective mitigation instrument because they exploit all possible behavioral responses for reducing emissions throughout the economy. Regulatory policies (at least in isolation) tend to be much less effective, because they focus on a narrower range of these responses.
    * Climate change mitigation policies affect countries’ economic growth, saving and investment levels, capital flows, and exchange rates. But IMF analysis suggests these costs are manageable if policies are well designed.

    * The 4°C scenarios are devastating: the inundation of coastal cities; increasing risks for food production potentially leading to higher malnutrition rates; many dry regions becoming dryer, wet regions wetter; unprecedented heat waves in many regions, especially in the tropics; substantially exacerbated water 
scarcity in many regions; increased frequency of high-intensity tropical cyclones; and irreversible loss of 
biodiversity, including coral reef systems. And most importantly, a 4°C world is so different from the current one that it comes with high uncertainty and new risks that threaten our ability to anticipate and plan for future adaptation needs.
    * Projections of damage costs for climate change impacts typically assess the costs of local damages, including infrastructure, and do not provide an adequate consideration of cascade effects (for example, value-added chains and supply networks) at national and regional scales. 
    * Thus, given that uncertainty remains about the full nature and scale of impacts, there is also no certainty that adaptation to a 4°C world is possible. A 4°C world is likely to be one in which communities, cities and countries would experience severe disruptions, damage, and dislocation, with many of these risks spread unequally. It is likely that the poor will suffer most and the global community could become more fractured, and unequal than today.

1367780474.0,45,self.NeutralPolitics,1dqt5l,Tort reform,48,3,50,http://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/1dqt5l/tort_reform/,"[""Tort Reform""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tort_reform) in the US context is the name given to a broad set of proposals designed to make it more difficult for people to file civil lawsuits seeking compensation when they have been harmed by others.

Such suits, which have become commonplace in the US, are seen by many as frivolous, excessive, unwarranted and a waste of resources. Companies, municipalities, medical practitioners and other professionals argue that the suits drive up the cost of liability and malpractice insurance, which then gets passed on to the consumers.

When tort reform policies are promoted in the US, they're usually framed as an attempt to stop frivolous lawsuits by opportunistic individuals, filed by unscrupulous lawyers. That certainly sounds like a laudable goal and it appeals to our sense of fairness. [Polls show](http://www.businessinsider.com/tort-reform-poll-2012-8) the idea has broad support.

However, Susan Saladoff argues in her documentary [*Hot Coffee*](http://www.hotcoffeethemovie.com/) that this view is the result of a prolonged media campaign by big business to swing public opinion against the protections afforded by the courts. She puts forth the idea that tort reform proposals are essentially a corporate wolf in sheep's clothing; that in an age of rampant [regulatory capture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_capture), limiting civil suits would severely hamper one of the only avenues of redress consumers have left against dangerous or negligent business practices.

In the wake of the tragic [explosion at the West Fertilizer Company](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/19/us/huge-blast-at-texas-fertilizer-plant.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=1&amp;) in West, Texas, I think it's worth exploring this issue further.

We don't yet know what caused the explosion, but given the [news reports coming out](http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/04/20/us-usa-explosion-regulation-idUSBRE93J09N20130420), negligence is certainly a possibility.
It was just reported that [the plant only carried $1 million worth of liability insurance](http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/attorney-texas-fertilizer-plant-that-exploded-carried-only-1-million-in-liability-coverage/2013/05/04/cccab504-b4e8-11e2-9fb1-62de9581c946_story.html).

Fourteen people lost their lives on April 17th, while over 200 were injured and dozens of families had their homes destroyed. Property damage alone is estimated at over $100 million.

Over the previous decade, Texas had passed substantial tort reform measures. In general, they limit the types and dollar amounts of civil claims. There are [positive](http://www.texaspolicy.com/sites/default/files/documents/2008-05-RR04-tortreform-jnixon-posting.pdf) and [negative](http://www.texaswatch.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Tort-Reform-in-Texas_0911.pdf) views of the results.

The conflicting assessments of such measures bring up a number of questions in light of the recent tragedy:

* Does tort reform introduce [moral hazard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_hazard) into the calculations with respect to dangerous industries?
* Is it possible that liability limits actually encourage a degree of negligence on the part of companies? They can implement cost-cutting measures, such as less frequent safety inspections, reduced staff or limited training, without worrying that the potential cost of lawsuits if something goes wrong will exceed the savings made by implementing those measures.     
* Is it possible that the plant was built in this town, or at least in Texas, because it's a jurisdiction where an accident due to negligence would not require a large payout?
* Even if tort reforms do introduce greater risks, might such measures still be worthwhile from an economic standpoint? That is, if you were a resident of Texas, would you approve of companies relocating there, bringing in more jobs and economic growth, knowing that the tradeoff might be your safety?     
* If your family had one of those homes, and it's discovered that there was negligence by the plant operator, how would you feel about the government placing statutory limits on how much compensation you can receive?
* Are there other ways to address the problem of frivolous lawsuits while maintaining high incentives for companies to be vigilant against negligence?

I will try to keep it as organized and rant-free as possible, but please be patient with me. That being said, this won't be upvoted for anybody to see anyway, so who cares.

**The people who are in charge of this country don't want to fix it**

We have a whopping two ideologies to choose from out of an entire political spectrum. Why is this?

Nobody makes policy for the good of the country anymore. They can't. It's all about making money for your next campaign. Republicans are in bed with oil, Democrats are in bed with the pharmaceutical and healthcare industries, and every other large corporation and industry in between lobbies on both sides. You want to change the system? You can't. The only way to get into power is to come up through one of the two major parties because the parties contribute to financing the campaign and their support is needed to win. (See Ron Paul). So who actually makes the policy? It depends on who has the largest check book.

**Politicians take advantage of a population that is consistently and progressively becoming more and more ignorant and/or apathetic..**

Look at what's going on in the media right now. Both candidates are talking about the economy. There are other issues, but more on that later. On one side you have the Republicans talking about their budget that they've made and criticizing the president for not having a plan. Meanwhile, the Republican side has revealed no specifics about their budget and the majority of the populous is too stupid to realize that as the president of the country, you already have a budget as is. If that is their only plan to fix things in terms of jobs and the economy, it won't help. Personal debt is a much more significant factor than the national debt in how far the economy has fallen.


EDIT: *People being in debt leads to less money being invested in the economy and less faith in the economy. Low faith in the economy results in lesser investment in government bonds which leads to a greater rate in our debt being bought up, thus causing higher inflation. In other words, although a larger national debt leads to inflation and currency depreciation, a large amount of personal debt within the economy only accelerates the process. If the internal economy was healthy, it could help hinder it. In addition, private debt undermines supply side economics due to the government's inability to mandate where stimulus money is spent (as it should be). As a result, that money goes into paying off personal debt as opposed to, let's say, a small or growing business that would take that money and use it to expand and further grow the economy.*

 You would think that Obama would point this out, right? No. Instead, he's asking why Romney made a birther joke. Do you know how much policy that affects? None. Not an iota. Meanwhile, the people are completely buying into each side bashing the other and nobody seems to realize that *if each side just talks about who they aren't, what's wrong with the other side, and what they wouldn't do, there is NO motivation to change ANYTHING.* Every promise will already have been fulfilled just for being who they are because the only promise that was made was to not be the other guy. It's a perpetual cycle of bullshit.


**The media has no integrity anymore**

This is obviously on a relative scale to how things used to be. Everything is based on ratings. Everything. It determines you budget for your programs and your resources as a result. What happens when you mix what should be an objective presentation of information with a desire to be entertaining? Two things: First, you get sensationalism on every single story and issue. This makes it easy for politicians. They can bring up one issue for an entire election season and have these news networks go on and on about it. They run on planks instead of platforms now. Obviously platforms are developed at each convention, but they are only guidelines and how many citizens out there are really educated or interested enough to know or care? Second, you get subjective viewpoints from people which sways the news in one direction with a massive amount of bias. This is how we get networks like Fox News and MSNBC. Eventually, that bias gets so mixed in with the sensationalism that it's just lie after lie after lie. Just look at Fox during the healthcare debate or MSNBC on Romney's companies. How do people fulfill their duty to be informed when news outlets are all swayed to one radical viewpoint and the politicians all spin in the same way? And this is just assuming that these people are intelligent enough to recognize it and care enough to want to.


**People keep saying what's wrong but nobody says how to fix it.**

This is the most tiresome part of politics. It happens in the news. It happens in the house. It happens in the senate. It happens on this sub. Well I'm going to provide a few points of reform to fix these issues:

**1. Exclusively public financing of campaigns.**

I'd say that we cut out the middle man, but corporations don't speak for us either. Now, candidates have to actually campaign on issues instead of special interests. Corporations aren't people, and even if they were, it wouldn't matter anymore. Not to mention the fact that more limited funds for campaigning would make candidates use their money more wisely.

Currently in this country, 1% of the population holds 35% of the wealth. Congress is composed 50/50 of people within and outside of this 1% group. That's completely disproportional. By doing this, we can put the common man in power so that this Aristocracy stops forming. It will also allow for third parties to get more involved instead of just being a distraction.

**2. Ban negative ads.**

Crazy, right? What else is there? Now we can actually hear each candidates ideas on how to fix things instead of why the other guy won't. And I know, it would never work, right? My philosophy: If Mexico can do it, then why the hell can't we?

EDIT: Has been addressed several times. See other comments please.

**3. Eliminate the ratings system for media outlets.**

Replace it with something else. Keep it private, but base it off of accuracy of information instead of how entertaining it is. Fox News is the top rated news network on cable, but according to several polls, those that subscribe to it are consistently the most uninformed citizens out there. 

What does that tell you?

**4. Eliminate the electoral college.**

The electoral college is an archaic part of our system that was around back when counting the popular vote was implausible. What's more? The people that vote ""for us"" are all people that were involved in somebody's campaign. If you can count our votes, do so. Period.

**5. Hold congressional elections every four years offsetting the presidency, and create term limits of 2 or 3.**

This is a good idea for a few reasons: First, people undervalue the power of congress, especially during a presidential election year. Though it is limited, there is more variety in congressional political viewpoints, and this should be fostered. If congressional elections are not overshadowed by the presidential elections, people should pay more attention to them. Furthermore, congress has substantially more power to make significant changes to the things that we want to change in government than the president does. The federal branch is nothing more than a tool to enforce what the legislative branch decides. By ensuring that terms are four years long, we will avoid repeating the cycle of one year of action and one year of campaigning. Term limits also foster a better work ethic and motivation to get things done.

**6. Make philosophy a core subject in our school systems.**

I firmly believe that this is the only way to save our next generation. We teach our children logic and we give them the ability to distinguish objective and subjective information. They will be able to reason things and come up with ideas in an intelligent manner, and they will pass this on to their kids. This is a very minor change to our educational system relative to what we need, but it's a start.

This is just what I see and think. If you disagree, that's fine. I just really hope that we're at a point where you can at least read this and consider it before you bury it though. If you really read all of this, thank you for your time.

[/initial post]

Since posting this, I've had some other ideas too, but I just wanted to see some intelligent discussion on what I've already got to make sure that it wasn't just people's bias getting in the way of discussing them the first time.

**Edit:** For those who have not seen it, I have accepted that the second point on this list is a direct violation of the first amendment. The first point is too. That being said, if anybody else has a way to try to get to the same point by different means, I would be very happy to hear it.

[Their incarceration rate is 55 / 100,000 people.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_incarceration_rate) (Wiki). That puts them lower than any 1st world country other than Iceland.

On the other end of the extreme, the U.S.A. incarcerates 0.7% of its population? Holy crap. 

Living in Japan, I've found that people are definitely a little racist here (comes with the homogeneous population), and a few too many people (especially of the older generation) like to point out all the scary minorities in America as the cause of crime.

Now I want to be clear that I'm not suggesting that certain ethnicities in general are more criminally minded, but is there anything to the notion that a more ethnically diverse society will inevitably have more criminal problems? For anyone with more information on the topic, what is Japan doing to keep those rates so low?

**Today we are introducing a [new set of guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/18igw6/meta_guidelines_for_rneutralpolitics/) for this subreddit. Please read them before posting or commenting anywhere on /r/NeutralPolitics.**

Here are the highlights:

* We now allow only self-posts, though we *strongly* encourage links to qualified sources within those posts.
* We're here to talk about **evidence-based** politics.
* We already have a set definition of ""neutral politics"", complete with examples of what we do and don't consider ""neutral"".
* We want posts to generate actual discussion, not ""circlejerks"" or speculation. As such, we have some rules about post content.
* Comments are also held to a high standard. If you make assertions without a source or engage in other behavior that detracts from the conversation, your comment will be subject to removal.
* The mods here aim to be ""stern but fair"". Mods will remove posts and comments that violate the rules (they can refer you to which ones if you ask) but will not remove comments simply because they disagree with them.
* If you think something about this subreddit needs to change, the Mod team is welcoming of any and all feedback.

In the last couple weeks, we've removed a lot of posts that didn't meet our guidelines, but the feedback from the OPs has been overwhelmingly positive. This tells us that, by and large, users seem to understand what we're doing here, so we want to thank you all for helping us create a different kind of dynamic in our little corner of reddit.

Finally, please welcome back /u/PavementBlues for a limited engagement as mod while we regain our footing, and our newest mod, /u/IdProQuo!

1369335938.0,43,self.NeutralPolitics,1ex5kp,Obamas speech on the war on the future of the war on terror; beginning of the end or just more talk,55,12,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/1ex5kp/obamas_speech_on_the_war_on_the_future_of_the_war/,"Obama delivered a major speech on the war on terror, civil liberties, Guantanamo bay and drone policy today, my question is do you believe him why or why not?

you can find the transcript here http://livewire.talkingpointsmemo.com/entry/read-transcript-of-obamas-speech-on-counterterrorism-policy

In the speech he makes some pretty interesting statements on 
1.the future of the war on terror
""We must define the nature and scope of this struggle, or else it will define us, mindful of James Madison’s warning that “No nation could preserve its freedom in the midst of continual warfare.” Neither I, nor any President, can promise the total defeat of terror. We will never erase the evil that lies in the hearts of some human beings, nor stamp out every danger to our open society. What we can do – what we must do – is dismantle networks that pose a direct danger, and make it less likely for new groups to gain a foothold, all while maintaining the freedoms and ideals that we defend.

2.Drone warfare
""much of the criticism about drone strikes – at home and abroad – understandably centers on reports of civilian casualties. There is a wide gap between U.S. assessments of such casualties, and non-governmental reports. Nevertheless, it is a hard fact that U.S. strikes have resulted in civilian casualties, a risk that exists in all wars...But as Commander-in-Chief, I must weigh these heartbreaking tragedies against the alternatives. To do nothing in the face of terrorist networks would invite far more civilian casualties – not just in our cities at home and facilities abroad, where terrorists seek a foothold... Where foreign governments cannot or will not effectively stop terrorism in their territory, the primary alternative to targeted, lethal action is the use of conventional military options... The result would be more U.S. deaths, more Blackhawks down, more confrontations with local populations, and an inevitable mission creep in support of such raids that could easily escalate into new wars.

3.Civil liberties
""the choices we make about war can impact – in sometimes unintended ways – the openness and freedom on which our way of life depends. And that is why I intend to engage Congress about the existing Authorization to Use Military Force, or AUMF, to determine how we can continue to fight terrorists without keeping America on a perpetual war-time footing. The AUMF is now nearly twelve years old. Unless we discipline our thinking and our actions, we may be drawn into more wars we don’t need to fight, or continue to grant Presidents unbound powers more suited for traditional armed conflicts between nation states. So I look forward to engaging Congress and the American people in efforts to refine, and ultimately repeal, the AUMF’s mandate. And I will not sign laws designed to expand this mandate further. Our systematic effort to dismantle terrorist organizations must continue. But this war, like all wars, must end. That’s what history advises. That’s what our democracy demands.""

4.Guantanamo bay
""As President, I have tried to close GTMO. I transferred 67 detainees to other countries before Congress imposed restrictions to effectively prevent us from either transferring detainees to other countries, or imprisoning them in the United States. These restrictions make no sense. After all, under President Bush, some 530 detainees were transferred from GTMO with Congress’s support. No person has ever escaped from one of our super-max or military prisons in the United States. Our courts have convicted hundreds of people for terrorism-related offenses, including some who are more dangerous than most GTMO detainees. Given my Administration’s relentless pursuit of al Qaeda’s leadership, there is no justification beyond politics for Congress to prevent us from closing a facility that should never have been opened.Today, I once again call on Congress to lift the restrictions on detainee transfers from GTMO. I have asked the Department of Defense to designate a site in the United States where we can hold military commissions. I am appointing a new, senior envoy at the State Department and Defense Department whose sole responsibility will be to achieve the transfer of detainees to third countries. I am lifting the moratorium on detainee transfers to Yemen, so we can review them on a case by case basis. To the greatest extent possible, we will transfer detainees who have been cleared to go to other countries. Where appropriate, we will bring terrorists to justice in our courts and military justice system. And we will insist that judicial review be available for every detainee.""

1367361867.0,44,self.NeutralPolitics,1dfy92,"In terms of electoral systems, is stability more important than fair representation, and are the two mutually exclusive?",53,9,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/1dfy92/in_terms_of_electoral_systems_is_stability_more/,"There are many different democratic electoral systems that have been conceived, with First Past the Post being the one we know and love/hate.  They can be broadly divided into 'majoritarian' and 'proportional representation' systems, but it's more of a spectrum than two camps.  

Majoritarian systems tend to produce strong majorities and thus strong governments, but frequently distort the result and discriminate against smaller parties.  For example, the Lib Dems in the UK frequently receive about a third of what their share of the vote would give them in a 'fair' system.^1  Another example is the 1980 presidential election in which Reagan won 44 states, despite only gaining 50.8% of the vote.^2  Under FPTP, many votes are squandered in 'safe seats' and only voters in marginal areas have significant impact on the outcome.  Smaller parties are discriminated against, as are those with geographically diverse support bases.  No minor party has, in recent history, gained a seat in the US Congress, for example, despite the Libertarian party, for example, consistently polling more than 1% of the national vote.  Under a pure PR system this would guarantee them 5 Congressional seats.^3

Proportional systems, on the other hand, also have issues.  They tend to lead to highly unstable and divided government.  Italy's extensive list of prime ministers speaks volumes about the potential results of this.^4  With 60 governments since the Second World War, it could be argued that such a complex and mercurial system of parties can only lead to gridlock and indecision.  Another example is Weimar Germany, which, between 1918 and 1933 saw a rapid succession of governments come and go as the country's underlying problems were left without address.  Far be it from me to invoke Godwin's Law, but it has been argued that the adoption of a PR system was one of the factors that hamstrung German politics and left an opening for the Nazi Party to gain an electoral stronghold.

Of course, there are other electoral systems that strike a balance - AMS as used in Germany, Scotland, Wales and New Zealand, or STV as used in Northern Ireland (which is my personal favourite) being just two examples.

Let's also, for a second, forget the loss of 'constituency link' aspect that makes PR somewhat unappealing.  Imagine that in this theoretical PR system, citizens had adequate recourse to raise their grievances.

So putting aside the alternative options (although feel free to discuss them if you so wish) - in a hypothetical situation, in which one might have to either choose the stability offered by the large (but disproportionate and unfair) FPTP system, or the potential instability but far more accurate representation of the populace's vote that would be produced by PR, which would you consider better?

I'm more interested in learning about the arguments for and against whaling, and their merit. 

For:

* No different to fishing or hunting
* Culling of whales increases population of other sea animals
* In some indigenous communities, it is a practical way to stay fed

Against:

* Will bring some whale species to extinction 
* The method of killing the whales is often cruel 
* Many whale species are sentient - killing them is morally wrong
* [Japanese whaling] Much of the Japanese whaling occurs in waters claimed by Australia

In particular, I notice that Tim Flannery, a staunch Australia environmentalist, [has largely supported the current Japanese program](http://www.news.com.au/breaking-news/flannery-says-japan-whaling-sustainable/story-e6frfkp9-1111115219473), while still condemning humpback whaling and any inhumane slaughter.",,False,,t5_2tk0i,False,,,True,t3_1hzzh8,http://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/1hzzh8/arguments_for_and_against_whaling/,

And I base this on three things that I observed at /r/conspiracies and /r/fringediscussion (three is a good number, why not?).

One thing is that conspiracies carry stories that are relevant to the news, or current events, and at least one major trend or societal issue. So, if there's a story about the Boston bombings, then it also has to do with police corruption, telecommunications spying, government transparency or another major issue. This means that a conspiracy touches not only on relevant topics, but on larger issues as well.

Another thing about conspiracists I find impressive is focus on a core set of ideas or beliefs about government and society. On the one hand, conspiracists often have a radical view of politics at large, and on the other, there often are problems in bureaucracies of properly implementing the will of the people without the creep of moneyed interests in the implementation.

I believe that at any one time there are a number of basic issues in politics that address a number of complex issues on a regional scale. So, one of the reasons that conspiracies may appeal to others is that a conspiracy almost always address at least on of these basic issues on some level, which can be used as a way to broach topics of corruption, incompetence, and other major issues in bureaucracies.

Something conspiracies tend to ignore is bureaucratic systems. In my experience, many conspiracies ignore the political process or make up tight-knit political entities.

Don't ignore conspiracists. If you think so, why are conspiracies abhorrent to you? Just think about it.

I'm not aware of any local parks that charge. Then I visited southern CA and was surprised at all the fees. Dozens of the state parks cost $8-$15 per vehicle. Many local parks charge $3 for weekdays and $5 for weekends. 

My question is: since California is supposed to be the more ""liberal"" state, shouldn't it promote social equality by allowing the poor better access to parks? I understand that some places have high population density and scarce parking, but I get the impression that most places just think they ought to bring in revenue. On the other hand, since North Carolina is supposed to be the more ""conservative"" state, why does it mostly use tax money to pay for parks? Given their reputed ideologies, shouldn't their positions be reversed?

Disclaimer: I'm talking about vehicle entrance fees; I know that both states charge for camping and neither charge for pedestrian admission. I don't care which system is better. I just want an explanation for the apparent political contradiction.

1332306530.0,41,self.NeutralPolitics,r6ci7,The Essence of left vs. right (long),55,14,58,http://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/r6ci7/the_essence_of_left_vs_right_long/,"Most political labels are pretty arbitrary. Terms such as conservative, liberal, socialist, ect. have so many definitions as to be practically meaningless. But not, I think, the terms left and right. Unlike most political definitions, these can be applied usefully throughout history. Though invented during revolutionary France, the idea of left and right can be used in almost any time and place. Even more remarkable is that everyone seems to agree on who is left or right of whom. People will endlessly debate who constitutes a “true” liberal or republican or conservative, or whatever, but everyone agrees that Rachel Maddow is left of Glenn Beck. Looking back through history, we get the same nigh universal agreement. There is some confusion regarding fascism, but no one would say that Sparta was left of Athens, that Stalin was left of Trotsky, or that the Confederacy was left of the Union.
So there seems to be some quality that seems to run through all politics, but what is it? What makes someone left or right?

First, it has nothing to do with which policies they advocate. Any policy you can think of has been supported by both leftist and rightists at some time. There are, or have been, right wing socialists and environmentalists, and left wing nationalists and militarists. Therefore, what distinguishes left from right cannot be what policy you propose, but your MOTIVE for proposing it. It's not individualism vs. communitarianism. The liberal project began as a defense of individual rights against patriarchal monarchy. But nationalism (the idea that each nation should have its own country) is about as communitarian as you can get and it got its start as a left wing ideology. Individualist strains run thick through both the left and the right today. While this is an important axis on which to evaluate politics, it is not the essential difference between left and right.

It is not Socialism vs. Capitalism. Like political liberalism, capitalism began opposed to monarchical government. Early capitalists like Adam Smith were famous liberals in their day, and their political movement was called Manchester Liberalism. There have also been serious right wing socialist movements, technocratic Taylorites and Fordists, some, though not all, of the fascists, and some post colonial nationalists like Nasser. And while capitalism has its home on the right today, it's not entirely comfortable there. I realize most redditors are pretty liberal, but let me assure you that there are plenty of strains of conservatism that distrust capitalism every bit as much as you do, for a variety of reasons. It's not Traditionalism vs. Change. Here I think we hit closer to the mark, but are still off. It's true that Burkean conservatism is basically an intellectual defense of tradition, but not all conservatives are Burkean. And while building a new world order is traditionally the province of the left, the twentieth century has certainly seen its share of rightwing social revolutionaries, principally the fascists and technocrats. Left wing traditionalists are fairly uncommon, but they also exist. Thoreau would be one example, as are some modern environmentalists and many indigenous rights groups. The truth is that everyone supports changing the things they don’t like and keeping the things they do the same.

The difference, and remember we are not talking about self interest here, is hierarchy. That is, the essential leftist motive is to tear down hierarchies while the right winger wants to preserve them. The right sees hierarchy as either good, necessary, natural, or some combination thereof, essential to human life, while the left either rejects them on principle, or sees the existing hierarchy as corrupt. Setting self interest aside, these attitudes toward hierarchy explain much of politics. For example, they tell us why democrats are almost always on the left and monarchists are almost always on the right. Democracy is, in theory, leveling, with everyone is empowered equally while monarchy is the opposite. Of course, there are few monarchists around today, but right wing democrats motivated primarily by the fear of tyrannical kings or problems of succession are acting out of perfectly consistent motives. Attitudes about hierarchy also help us explain the ideologically troubling fascists. Any explanation of left vs. right must explain how Ferdinand Franco ended up adopting almost the same politico/economic system as Mussolini, who was an internationally renowned hero of the left. The biggest political issue of the interwar period was strife between capital and organized labor. Fascism everywhere was sold to voters as way to end this strife, but different sellers had very different ends in mind.

On the left, fascists like Mussolini and Peron wanted to tear down the existing social order in favor of a more egalitarian one, but were keenly aware of the failure of socialist politics. They felt (somewhat rightly, that business interests were their primary opposition. Fascism was the original “third way” project, promising security and subsidy to big business in exchange for tilting the balance towards labor. Rightist fascists like Phibun, Franco, and Salazar didn’t much care won the labor/capital war, but thought that the conflict would tear society apart. Both groups thus had similar goals (controlling and moderating labor and capital) and thus adopted similar institutional structures, but for very different reasons. The rightists wanted a stable, orderly system while the leftists wanted to end the domination of capital.

Hierarchy also explains why neither the left nor the right really embraces capitalism. Capitalism requires winners and losers which offends the leftist sensibility even if the result is pareto optimal, while the much of the right looks at Capitalism and sees a disorderly, chaotic mess that is constantly undermining existing hierarchies. Thus socialism (government ownership of the means of production) can be (and has been) supported by the left or the right, the left wanting to make people equal, and the right wanting and orderly system that maximizes productivity, because no one is entirely happy with the outcomes of capitalism.",,False,,t5_2tk0i,1374711633.0,,,True,t3_r6ci7,http://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/r6ci7/the_essence_of_left_vs_right_long/,

Is the comment an accurate comment in today's world?Prejudice being prevalent in America seemed to me to be very much the topic of his speech to students this weekend. (EDIT: I think the speech was also about how to overcome that prejudice. Did you gather other meanings?) Is the President right? Is he viewing one side or all sides?

I'm very curious as to why The President did not mention this kind of racism or prejudice as he did with so many other groups in that speech;

http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/blog/eye-on-football/21392746/rob-parker-calls-rg3-a-cornball-brother-says-hes-not-one-of-us

&gt;""My question, which is just a straight honest question: is he a brother, or is he a cornball brother?"" Parker asked to much confusion among the show's other participants. ""Well, [that] he's black, he kind of does his thing, but he's not really down with the cause, he's not one of us.

&gt;""He's kind of black, but he's not really the guy you'd really want to hang out with, because he's off to do something else.""

&gt;""I want to find about him,"" Parker said. ""I don't know because I keep hearing these things. We all know he has a white fiancee. Then there was all this talk about he's a Republican, which there's no information at all. I'm just trying to dig deeper into why he has an issue. Because we did find out with Tiger Woods, Tiger Woods was like, 'I've got black skin, but don't call me black.' So people wondered about Tiger Woods.""

This example I personally witnessed on TV near Christmas last year. I do not remember it being a national topic. Is this an instance of racism? Is this ""cornball brother"" mindset a widespread mindset in America? Did the President talk about this kind of racism and I just missed it? If so, what did he say? If the color roles were reversed, and a white announcer questioned a white football player's ""whiteness"" because that player dates a black woman and votes Democrat, would it have been a national issue or a ""Teachable Moment"" or racism? I think it clearly is. What do you think?

China should have seen a lot of trickling down to its lower classes but it has a [relatively high GINI coefficient](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_income_equality). In fact, I read an article which I can't find right now about how China's Gini coefficient might actually be a lot higher than the official figures show. However, [China has lifted an incredible people out of poverty](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty_in_the_People's_Republic_of_China#Poverty_reduction). According [this interview with the World Bank President](http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/video/2013/apr/04/jim-yong-kim-poverty-growth-video), it is not possible to lift people out of poverty without sustained growth which is what China (and to a lesser extent, India) has been showing. But, with the capital accumulation at the top of the Chinese pyramid, are people at the bottom actually getting much better lives or they only marginally better with the people at the top enjoying Chinese success. 

With exceptions, the countries with the lowest GINI coefficients in the link above are countries with active redistribution programmes. The US has a shockingly high GINI which I can personally attest to, having lived in very close proximity to an American ghetto for four years. High socio-economic inequality (leads to a large number of problems)[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_inequality#Effects_of_inequality].

tl;dr: does trickle down economics actually work? And if it does, are its positive effects (high growth rate (China), economic size (US)) outweighed by its negative effects (inequality)?

Because the advocates could not prove the programs had been used specifically and individually on themselves, their appeals were denied.

In 2006 [the ACLU filed a class action lawsuit against the NSA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_Liberties_Union_v._National_Security_Agency), challenging the constitutionality of the so-called [""Terrorist Surveillance Program,""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSA_electronic_surveillance_program) in which the NSA monitored and recorded communications between Americans and suspicious persons outside of the country. The ACLU was affirmed in district court, only to be dismissed by the appeals court on the issue of standing. The case was ultimately appealed to the Supreme Court, which turned down the case for deliberation. In 2008 [the Electronic Frontier Foundation filed a lawsuit against the NSA](https://www.eff.org/cases/jewel) with similar claims. The case was dismissed in district court over lack of standing. in his opinion, the presiding Judge Vaugahn Walker bluntly stated [""A citizen may not gain standing by claiming a right to have the government follow the law.""](http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/01/nsa-spy-cases-tossed/)The dismissal was overturned in appeals court, and as of December 2012 the case is still ongoing.

Also in 2006 the EFF filed a lawsuit, [Hepting v. AT&amp;T](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepting_v._AT%26T), against AT&amp;T for their alleged illegal complicity in the aforementioned NSA program. The EFF's case was affirmed in district court. In response to this development, Congress passed the [FISA Amendments Act](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FISA_Amendments_Act), amending the [Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Intelligence_Surveillance_Act), the 1976 framework for foreign intelligence activities by the U.S. government passed in the wake of a flurry of indiscretions by the U.S. intelligence community in the 60s and 70s. The amendments, among other things, granted telecommunications companies which had cooperated with the government's surveillance program retroactive immunity from legal damages. Given this legal change, the EFF's case was dismissed by a federal appeals court.

Within hours of the passage of the FISA Amendments Act, the ACLU filed a lawsuit, [Amnesty v. Clapper (formerly Amnesty v. Blair)](http://www.aclu.org/national-security/amnesty-et-al-v-clapper), challenging it's constitutionality. The case was dismissed in district court over standing, but affirmed in appeals court. In the aforementioned decision handed down today, the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that the plaintiffs lacked standing because they could not prove they themselves had been subject to the allegedly illegal surveillance program.

The consensus over the proper legal protocol to assess standing in these surveillance cases is far from broad, as laid out in 2009 in the [UCLA Law Review by ACLU staff attorney Scott Michelman](http://www.uclalawreview.org/?p=781) who claims that, ""in some cases, courts impose on surveillance plaintiffs a stricter test for probabilistic injuries than exists in the rest of standing law.""

Questions:

1. In light of this trend of dismissal, barring the case of Jewel v. NSA, what legal recourse do citizens concerned about the growth of the surveillance state have?

2. What middle ground can be found between correctly assessing standing and allowing important legal questions of the state's surveillance ability to go through?


3. Do these dismissals constitute a tacit go-ahead on the part of the courts to the government to use surveillance methods the usage of which is impossible to prove?",,False,,t5_2tk0i,False,,,True,t3_19a18b,http://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/19a18b/if_it_is_functionally_impossible_to_legally_cite/,

Land value taxes have a lot to recommend them. Economically, they're highly efficient; the supply of land is inelastic, and so land taxes do not distort the market in the way that most other taxes do. They're very cheap to administer, and land is a very stable tax base. Also, it's virtually impossible to evade a land tax, since you can't hide your land.

Philosophically, no one created land, and so the value of land derives exclusively from its natural resources and from the shared structures and institutions that society has built. Therefore, a land tax can be thought of as the compensation that landlords pay for the benefits that they enjoy, none of which they truly ""earned"".

Yet, despite all these advantages, land taxes are not very popular, especially not in the United States. Instead, we rely on property taxes that include improvements, and on complex systems of transaction taxes (e.g. on retail sales and income).

Sorry about this, we really try to make sure meta-posts are a rarity, but things are never so simple.

In the past several hours we've removed two separate threads that are related to the [Boston bombing](http://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2013/04/15/three-killed-more-than-injured-marathon-blast/QQOiYNU2n1vt1Xul3BXVsL/story.html). Both threads had issues with being speculative and have loaded questions that were not constructive. This is in part an explanation of why we're one of the few politics communities that doesn't have a thread visible at this point in time.

This is a good time to talk about how NeutralPolitics and current events interact. Not to say that we can only discuss old events for which the history has been written, but there are certain guidelines that are important.

 **All the rules regarding a good OP apply to all threads. A good thread:**

    Asks a specific question
    Outlines the issue well
    Links to a qualified source or sources
    Proposes a starting point for discussion
    Identifies potential flaws in the arguments presented
    Contains an accurate title

The first two points are the most important.

First point, you need to have a specific question that can be answered with some amount of information and expertise. [NP guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/18igw6/meta_guidelines_for_rneutralpolitics/) don't allow ""taking the temperature"" threads. ""What do you think about Boston? is something best discussed in a news subreddit.

Second point, do not assume that current events are common knowledge. *The OP has the responsibility of being informative and current with their information.* Regarding the Boston threads that emerged just a couple hours after the explosions, every user that arrives will have a different set of events that they have heard about and read. Much like we don't allow hearsay and baseless speculation in a thread on, say, the Cold War- this is not waived for current events.

Please consider all six points when making a thread, and report threads that have obvious shortcomings.

On a personal note, I hope you all and your family are safe. This was not the only bloodshed Monday (several bombings in Iraq, continued war in Syria and parts of Africa), and perhaps we can find commonality with each other through these events.

Take care, stay safe.

* **Be bold**- Please state your opinion honestly and freely. However, respect the need for factual evidence and good logic when you post an opinion.
* **Be neutral**- Leave your assumptions at the door. Be open-minded to others.

Now one idea I have a hard time grasping is what is called corporate tyranny or the idea that in a libertarian society of minimal government, corporations will step in to fill that power vacuum and since they aren't  accountable to us like a government is, they will abuse us.

This idea is expressed perhaps most eloquently by Noam Chomsky. [This link](http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article30251.htm) provides a video of him talking about Ron Paul a little bit. The crux of his argument can probably be summed up by this quote

""In fact, it goes through the whole so-called Libertarian ideology. It may sound nice on the surface but if you think it through, it's just a call for corporate tyranny. It takes away any barrier to corporate tyranny.""

I'd like to hear arguments about whether or not Libertarianism truly is nothing more than a call for corporate tyranny and second, just what exactly corporate tyranny is. I find that people usually refer to emotional arguments about this subject so I chose this subreddit as an attempt to have a rational discussion instead. I find that most people simply have to mention the ""phrase corporate"" tyranny and it's checkmate because I'm put in the odd position of having to defend tyranny.

Are wars that involve them otherwise solvable?,55,14,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/1hz1mt/international_weekafrica_can_conflict_minerals_be/,"One of the most volatile regions in the world is Central Africa, especially around the Kivu region in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. The region is also home to rich amounts of gold and coltan, much of which can be mined using traditional pre-machine methods.

In the United States, conflict minerals are now beginning to be regulated due to provisions in the Dodd-Frank economic reform bill- [this release from the SEC](http://www.sec.gov/news/press/2012/2012-163.htm) in 2012 indicates that companies will have to file disclosures on their use of conflict minerals in products starting in May 2014, covering the 2013 calendar year. The European Union opened a consultation on the issue for business and private interests to state their opinions on conflict minerals, and Canada is on a similar road. The SEC rule is [up in court](http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/07/01/us-sec-conflictminerals-idUSBRE96017220130701) due to the plantiffs saying that sourcing small amount of conflict minerals in their supply change is a huge burden.

One question is whether conflict minerals are a tool of war or a way to provide income to highly undeveloped economies. [Mvemba Dizolele of the conservative Hoover Institution](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mvemba-dizolele/conflict-minerals-congo-dodd-frank_b_933078.html), in a long and detailed editorial,  states

&gt;thousands of families now live off this informal mineral trade, which generates between $300 million and $1.4 billion a year. The long supply chain ensures that people who would otherwise be unemployed and starve have a minimal income. These people, however, are likely to pay a high price for the legislation and lose their livelihood. 

Also positing that militias have enough sources of income that stamping down on conflict minerals would not stop their activities. 

There are many more aspects to explore (and there are activist groups like [Global Witness](http://www.globalwitness.org/) who offer a counterpoint to viewpoints like Dizolele’s, but an OP is not supposed to be a personal academic paper. Questions:

**Are conflict minerals an important part of various conflicts, especially in Africa?**

1368232747.0,38,self.NeutralPolitics,1e3q6p,[META] New theme and many other changes at /r/NeutralPolitics,47,9,37,http://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/1e3q6p/meta_new_theme_and_many_other_changes_at/,"Dear Neutrons,

We're making some upgrades here at Neutral Politics. The first thing you'll notice is the new, cleaner theme, but there's a whole host of other changes too, so here's the rundown:

***Announcements***

* We've installed a new theme that's intended to make the sub easier to read and navigate. (Thanks to mods /u/canipaybycheck, /u/idProQuo, and /u/computanti for the CSS work.)
* The bullet points from the sidebar have been removed and integrated into the subreddit's description and [guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/guidelines). The idea is to direct users towards the guidelines instead of a shortcut summary. Hopefully, that will improve general understanding of how the sub works.
* The [guidelines are now a true wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/guidelines), complete with a linked table of contents so you can jump right to a section if you have a question about something.
* The downvote arrow has been removed for comments. We're going to try this out for a while and see how it goes. We're especially keen to see if it encourages more reporting, which is very helpful to the mods.
* Last week, we implemented reddit's new [comment score delay feature.](http://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/1dd0xw/moderators_new_subreddit_feature_comment_scores/) This hides all comment scores for a specified period of time to avoid the ""bandwagon"" voting effect. We're slowly ratcheting up the delay to see how it works best. It's currently at 4 hours.
* The submission page now contains a warning and a link to the guidelines.
* There is now a [wiki page for META posts.](http://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/meta)

***Rules &amp; reminders***

* Please read the [guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/guidelines). Every post or comment that gets removed has violated the sub's guidelines in some way. Help reduce our workload and improve the quality of content by familiarizing yourself with the rules before clicking ""submit.""
* Only moderators may create META posts. Although we appreciate the desire of the community to improve /r/NeutralPolitics, META posts from non-mods add confusion. If you would like to contribute a suggestion or discussion topic for the sub, please [message the mods](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FNeutralPolitics) for guidance first.
* The mods strongly encourage reporting. It's the best tool we have to keep conversations in line, so if you see a comment or post that does not adhere to the guidelines, please let us know by reporting it. This is especially important when we get flooded with comments by users cross-linked from another sub, since they're unfamiliar with how things work around here. And don't worry... reporting is completely anonymous; nobody knows who reported a comment.
* When posting, please put in a little effort. We've had to remove a discouraging number of low effort posts lately. Try to do at least the minimal amount of research needed to link to a good source or two before submitting. This isn't /r/answers.
* Our user base is international, so please try not to assume USA-centric readership in your submissions. Terms like ""the government,"" ""the two party system,"" and even ""right wing"" mean different things, or mean nothing, in other parts of the world. When using such terms, either define them or specify USA.
* *What to do if your post gets removed.* Mods will always message OPs stating the reason(s) for removing a post. But that's not the end of the story. If the topic is appropriate for r/NeutralPolitics, we'll usually give suggestions on how to fix it, and if you want mod feedback before reposting, we're happy to provide that too. Sadly, most submitters never take advantage of these opportunities and their posts just die. The mod team would like to see that change, so if your post gets removed, try to see it as an opportunity to learn what works here and then resubmit. It's notable that the most upvoted user submission in the history of /r/NeutralPolitics was the result of a user engaging in this process with mods after his original submission was removed.

***Feedback***

Feedback from our users is always encouraged. If you have questions or comments about anything in this post or about /r/NeutralPolitics in general, don't hesitate to comment below or [message the mods.](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FNeutralPolitics)

1366085263.0,36,self.NeutralPolitics,1cfw09,Is moving to a service based economy necessarily a good thing in the long run?,39,3,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/1cfw09/is_moving_to_a_service_based_economy_necessarily/,"So this is another broad question I've been thinking about while looking at Thatcher's legacy in the past week. Thatcher is credited with destroying British manufacturing in the name of moving towards a service economy. Like many of her ideas, this one is controversial, but I'd like to examine it in a global context and see how it holds up.

[Here's where various national economies stand right now.](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3d/Gdp-and-labour-force-by-sector.png)

[Here are their GDP per capita.](http://www.econguru.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/gdp_nominal_per_capita_world_map_imf_2007.PNG)

As you can see, many developing nations have agricultural economies that are moving towards manufacturing as a result of globalization. In many developed nations, manufacturing is now being outsourced to places where it can be done more cheaply, and a service economy is taking hold.

This would seem to indicate that the direction of ""progress"" is to go from an agricultural economy to a manufacturing economy to a service economy.

However, there are some factors missing from the map above. I've heard some people argue that moving to a service economy results in more inequality and causes wealth to be concentrated in the hands of the wealthy.

For the sake of comparison, [here's a map](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ef/World_Map_Gini_coefficient_with_legend_2.png) showing the [Gini coefficient](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient) for various countries (higher coefficients and hotter colors correspond with more inequality).

So, now we've got a ton of data to look at, I want to ask you guys some questions:

* Is this movement from agricultural to manufacturing to service a positive one? If it isn't, what do you consider to be ""progress""?
* Does a service economy **cause** (not just correlate with) inequality? How/Why?
* As the nature of a national economy changes, how can workers from the ""old economy"" adjust so that they can contribute to the ""new economy""? Should they be expected to change? (This seems to be a big problem when manufacturing jobs are outsourced or automated)
* Are there examples of countries that are flourishing despite not having a service based economy? How is their wealth distribution? What can we learn from them?",,False,,t5_2tk0i,False,,,True,t3_1cfw09,http://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/1cfw09/is_moving_to_a_service_based_economy_necessarily/,

In reality, I think a better way to describe them is as revenue decreases.

I understand that the effect of increasing spending by $100 or decreasing taxes by $100 does the same thing to the surplus/(deficit), so this might seem like splitting hairs or focusing on meaningless semantics. However, I think this language reflects the way that many people think about government budget decisions. I hope not to appear too fervently neo-liberal here, but I think taxes are basically a necessary evil. The default should be that people pay no taxes, and the burden should be on those arguing for a type of spending to demonstrate that that spending is worth the associated tax. The status quo view, that sees tax cuts as a type of spending, confuses the services that citizens want with the revenue source that makes those services possible. This makes a cost-benefit analysis of government programs more difficult.

[Inglehart and Welzel](http://indicatorsinfo.pbworks.com/f/Inglehart+Mass+Priorities+and+Democracy.pdf) (link to a paper, in PDF) are the two major evangelizers, and quite a lot of political science and developmental economics in the post-WW2 era is about the problem of why countries are or are not democratic. 

The basic idea is more wealth- especially towards a new middle class, leads to value changes that make a population more interested and supportive of pluralism and democracy, over fundamentalism and authoritarian or theocratic rule. 
There are clearly countries with a lot of cash that aren’t democratic. The oil-rich Persian Gulf is a good example- but their wealth acquisition is very lopsided and unusual. However, the city-state of Singapore has no natural resources. They gained a very high level of wealth through industry, trade, and education. The end result is a very forward-thinking population. 

But Singapore is not a free country. Its press freedom [was ranked 149th in the world by Reporters Without Borders](http://en.rsf.org/press-freedom-index-2013,1054.html), about the same as Russia. The dominant party (81 of 87 seats), [has been criticized for using defamation](http://www.economist.com/node/17419873) and libel laws to silence opposition.The conservative-leaning Freedom House backs up RWB by starting that the country is [partly free, with a “not free” press](http://www.freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2013/singapore).

Usually abolition of the 17th amendment is brought up by conservatives or right-wing Republicans, but I like the idea that the state legislatures choose the Senators to represent their state. Could also prevent more extreme Senators and may lead to more competitive races (more competent opponents)

On the other hand--yeah people get more of a ""voice"". Heck, that was the main reason the 17th amendment came about--the Progressive Era, &amp;c. And also, state legislatures were having trouble seating Senators and this led to more open seats.

Thoughts?

Edit: So it seems there's a couple more people in favor of having the Amendment abolished that not. Now, I'm not trying to win or lose this obviously (that's why i'm loving this subreddit recently) as we can do nothing about it. I like the idea of having 1 of the Senators elected by the legislature--and definitely keeping different Classes of Senators, but personally would definitely not be opposed to having them both just be elected by the state legislatures. I think if the Amendment were to be removed, I think I would wish for a Non-Partisian / Citizenship redistricting process in every state. I like the idea of state legislatures having a more prominent role again and I vehemently think that the process could be a check on a more radical Senator that may be voted in by 1% or 2%.

A [2010 BBC feature](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-10742109) talked to researchers and diplomats. Prof Adam Roberts of Oxford opens the story by stating

&gt;""There are very few cases where you can definitely identify sanctions as having had a success, except sometimes in combination with other factors,"" he says.

Diplomat Jeremy Greenstock points out that

Would a system work where everyone pays a tax that would allow the government to cover them for catastrophic medical expenses over a certain cost, similarly to how a fire department would attempt to save your home/property if a fire were to start, but it is up to the person for minor repairs.

Just using $50,000 as a round figure, any medical costs over that would be covered by government, and anything under could be covered by out of pocket or private insurance.  

I believe that would lower overall costs to consumers as if the insurance companies do not have to worry about the costs over $50,000 so they could drastically lower premiums.  Then it would be up to individuals to worry about the minor checkups and small things.

you not fertile?

Conflicts between individual citizens could result in a few deaths or injuries, but casualty figures pretty much scaled linearly with the number of people involved. To inflict mass casualties required involvement of the state, with its huge resources and logistical expertise. This requirement often (though, not always) acted as a safeguard against random acts of mass violence.

But in the modern world, advances in technology have placed mass violence in the hands of the individual citizens. The potential number of casualties per perpetrator has risen dramatically with the advent of [IEDs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Improvised_explosive_device), [ANFO bombs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANFO#Malicious_use) and [~~automatic~~ assault weapons](http://www.kevinmd.com/blog/2013/01/easier-assault-weapon-doctor.html).

America was plunged into this reality with the [Oklahoma City bombing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City_bombing). That was followed by 9/11 and now we've got the Boston Marathon bombings. In between, there have been mass shooting incidents where a one or two perpetrators have been able to claim the lives of dozens of victims.

I think it's safe to assume the march of technology cannot be halted. The information and experience needed to create simple weapons that produce mass casualties is only getting more widespread. Just today, there was a news report that [the 3D-printed handgun is now a reality](http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2013/05/the-first-entirely-3d-printed-handgun-is-here/). So, if we want to limit these incidents of violence, we're going to have to deal with the individuals who perpetrate them, not the tools they use to wreak their havoc.

The question is, how do we do that?

I've heard people argue that a lot of these incidents come down to a mental health problem, and reforming our mental health system is a key factor in prevention. I'm sure there's some truth to that, but it can't be the whole story. Some of these crimes are politically motivated. Political bombings in Northern Ireland, Israel and Spain were commonplace for decades, but they seem to have been largely resolved. How did those countries deal with the problem?

I've heard other arguments amounting to an acceptance that there will always be evil-doers, so limiting civil liberties is the only way to prevent these incidents in the future. But there are plenty of countries that haven't limited civil liberties and they're not suffering from frequent attacks, so again, this seems not to be a definitive answer.

The upshot is, access to the means of causing mass violence is basically universal, but the violence itself is not. What can the places that are suffering from such violence learn from the places that aren't?

**TL;DR:** The world is getting smaller and destructive technology is getting more accessible. What do we need to change so we can all live together peacefully?

-----

**EDIT:** Some responses indicate that people think this post is about or advocating gun control, so let me clarify this in a way that I hope Second Amendment advocates (of which I am one) will understand.

Let's take it as a given that ""guns don't kill people; people kill people."" Assume the same holds for bombs and IEDs. All of those weapons, depending on their power, allow for a single attacker to cause multiple casualties, and all have become easier/cheaper to acquire/build in recent years. Signs indicate that trend will continue and any efforts to reverse it are futile. 

OK? No taking of guns. No effective regulation of pressure cookers or fertilizer. We're all able to arm ourselves, whether or not we intend to.

Now, if we accept all that, how do we reduce incidents of mass violence caused by one or two individuals? In other words, if it's the people, not the weapons, who are the killers, how do we fix people? And isn't that going to become more important as the availability of weapons of mass violence increases?",,False,,t5_2tk0i,1367789572.0,,,True,t3_1dp6v5,http://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/1dp6v5/the_democratization_of_mass_violence_and_what_to/,

Democracy derives it's legitimacy from it's popular mandate.  Given the dropping interaction with politics and disenfranchisement with traditional parties and methods of engagement, can democracy afford to continue as it has?

I'm no expert on the legislative branch of our government so forgive me if this sounds totally ridiculous, but really.....is Congress an outdated concept?  

Pre-internet, we needed these people.  We relied on them to be our voice.  We voted them in to represent us and act in our (and the countrys) best interest.  But lately it seems our voice is being drowned out and sold to the highest bidder in the form of special interest groups and lobbyists.  On top of that, we've got two sides that are more interested in playing politics, pointing the finger and kicking the can down the road than actually accomplishing anything meaningful.  And if something actually does get done, it's watered down to the point where no one really benefits.  It's all about winning the next election and not making waves (translation: maintain the status quo).  

Now that we all have this thing called the internets, filled with social media, instant polling, endless information, ect......wouldn't it be more efficient and a truer form of Democracy to cut Congress out and vote on the issues ourselves?  And wouldn't this (for the most part) cut out the special interest groups and lobbyists that are standing in the way of the will of the people?  Isn't that a little more in line with what our founding fathers would have wanted?  Instead of decisions being sold, elections being rigged, votes being suppressed and nothing getting done?  

We vote in an American Idol via text messaging in a matter of hours yet 2 months after Sandy Hook, Congress still can't decide what to do with gun control even though a majority of Americans want stricter gun laws?  Take that vote out of the hands of Congress, give it to the people and we'll have this settled by lunch tomorrow.  Done and done - next issue.

It's like a poorly run company with all these worthless levels of middle management.  I don't need 3 people telling me about my TPS reports.  Cut out the middle man.  Save some money and get shit done.  

So if you agree, I guess we just write our Congressman?

Naturally, that's why Presidents appoint Secretaries of State. [This ABC article](http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/06/romneys-secretary-of-state-whittling-the-list/) outlines a few candidates, as well as statements made by Romney himself.

As for his [official campaign website](http://www.mittromney.com/collection/foreign-policy), I'll go so far as to summarize his vision as:

* bullish support for Israel
* maintaining ""strong military presence"" in the Pacific vis-a-vis China
* using America's ""significant leverage"" over Pakistan and Afghanistan to promote buy-in from both nations in a program against al-Qaida
* new free trade agreements with Latin American states

I find the following line to be the best summation of his vision:

When it comes to increasing taxes on the rich, I have heard two conflicting narratives regarding how it will impact job creation.  The first narrative says that raising taxes and then spending that money will help create jobs because the money was not going to be used by the rich to purchase anything whereas the government will take the money and buy things with it thereby driving demand which creates jobs.  The second narrative says that increasing taxes on the rich cannot help the economy in this way because the money was already being used to create jobs through investment, and so at best the government would just be moving the money around with no net impact rather than moving it from places where it was creating fewer jobs to places where it will create more jobs.

I do not know enough about macroeconomics to make strong judgements about these narratives, so my question is:  to what extent is either, both, or neither of these narratives correct?

Note that I am assuming roughly optimal behavior on the part of the government in order to answer the question of *can* it create jobs through taxing the rich and spending their money, as opposed to whether the current people making up the government have the collective wisdom to use the money that it gets from taxes effectively towards this end.

I might not need to mention this in this subreddit, but while it can be interesting to consider the moral dimensions of increasing taxes on the rich, I think it would be best to restrict the discussion to whether taxing the rich and then spending their money could be an *effective* means if job creation of executed properly, regardless of its morality.",,False,,t5_2tk0i,False,,,True,t3_1hmet6,http://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/1hmet6/can_increasing_taxes_on_the_rich_and_then/,

Freedom of the press is generally considered essential to the preservation of a free and democratic society.  However, should we then say that all information should be free?  What would be the effects of 100% (or close to 100%) transparent government?

If your answer to the above question is 'disaster', then where should a line be drawn?

Take, for example, the current US law - it is ^apparently legal to publish classified information, but not to solicit it.  This raises the question of whether effective investigative journalism is possible with such restrictions.  How can a reporter come into the possession of information at all - never mind that which they have checked with alternate sources for factual accuracy - without aggressively pursuing classified information? 

It seems to me to be the equivalent of saying that the wolf is allowed to bite the deer so long as it doesn't chase it.

At the same time though, we must consider the alternate viewpoint - can a government be seen to be fostering a situation in which **leaking classified information is okay** as long as it's to a journalist?  It seems, to me at least, to be an untenable situation, as is the (suddenly contracting) legal grey area the press seem to have inhabited.

I want to point out right here that someone will undoubtedly bring up the 1st Ammendment below and that's all fine and dandy but some of us /r/NeutralPolitics readers don't live in 'Murrica so it's not really relevant to us, as it is irrelevant to the 200 or so other sovereign states in the world.  So if we could avoid a discussion entirely centred around that particular line of the US constitution that would be great, because I'm talking about press freedom on a global level.

And before the ""1st Amendment *ergo* journalists should be free from prosecution"" argument is made, the freedom of speech of every American is abridged in many different circumstances -extortion, false advertising claims and libel to name just three.  If I went around attempting to sell sunflower seeds as a cancer cure, the Supreme Court wouldn't give me a second glance if I tried to argue that my 1st Amendment rights were being breached.  Despite the broad brush painted by the *'Congress shall make no law...'*, **Congress has made such laws** and the Supreme Court has upheld them.

I understand the concerns about liberty and government intrusion, but I don't know how you could have a functional health insurance system without a mandate.

My reasoning is basically this:

1. If I have a serious health problem (hit by a car, suddenly get cancer, etc) it would be way, way too expensive for me (or most people) to pay for treatment out-of-pocket.

2. Since I have this risk of suddenly being exposed to a large cost that I can't avoid, the sensible thing is to get insurance so I can pay a little constantly instead of usually paying nothing but potentially needing to pay a whole lot at once.

3. It's not reasonable for a company to insure me on my own unless the premiums are really high, because otherwise they would be at risk of losing a lot of money -- they'd basically face the same problem I faced in step 1.

4. But that's fine since insurance companies work by insuring a bunch of people and pooling risk. As more people get pooled together, the risks get lower for the insurer and they can lower premiums.

5. The problem for the insurers is that people know how healthy they are -- so someone who eats right and exercises is less likely to get insurance than someone with a family history of heart disease. Which means that people buying into the insurance are riskier than the general population.

6. That sort of wipes out the ideal insurance market from step 4 -- if the pools are especially attractive to high-risk individuals, then premiums need to go up, which pushes out lower-risk individuals, which increases the aggregate risk, and so on.

7. The only way that you can really prevent this is to mandate participation in the health insurance market. That way everyone is insured and the premiums aren't too high.

That's my Healthcare Policy 101 understanding. Are there examples of functional modern healthcare systems without mandated coverage? If so, how do they work?

Like I said, I understand the government intrusion arguments surrounding this, but it seems like we should settle whether or not healthcare can be provisioned without extensive government involvement before we start arguing over whether that involvement is justified.",,False,,t5_2tk0i,False,,,True,t3_qd1zb,http://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/qd1zb/supposing_mandates_arent_possible_how_can_health/,

The problem with health care and insurance is that I do not find it a fair system.  I am a very big supporter of the free market, but the free market needs to be free on both ends.  The businesses need to be free to do business their own way, but the public also needs to be free to respond and protest.  I am not talking about holding up picket signs or anything, but protest in the best way possible against a business... not using them.

With healthcare, I do not see this as a possibility.  I could go to another doctor or another hospital, but the prices are uniform due to the insurance payments.  Some areas might only have one hospital in the area, therefore this is not even a possibility.  Situations like this foster the possibility of the abuse of the public, and I feel the need for government intervention since the public is not powerful enough to handle this themselves.

But that is a side rant, I apologize for going off topic.  I just wanted to try to draw the line of logic I am using.

I personally cannot justify health insurance being a for profit enterprise.  The problem that I have with it, is that any for profit business exists to make money.  That is their purpose, and that is okay.  I am not one to hate the rich because they are rich.  The problem with insurance is that that purpose of making money is contrary to the services that they provide.  I pay a premium to the insurance company with the understanding that my health care costs will be supported according to agreement of the plan.  Insurance companies, however, deny a large amount of claims.  In other words, I am paying for a service, that by nature, the insurance companies are disinclined to provide (and sometimes do not).

To me, the simplest solution to this whole issue is to make insurance companies function on a non-profit model.  In doing this, they would need to accept more claims in order to keep their funds to a certain level, and possibly lower their premiums to do so.

Many on the left are crying that this is unfair to the poor and favors the wealthy and corporations.

Ignoring the corporate tax removal lets look at the state income tax. On top of the sales tax you purchase for sales of items (excluding some certain products such as groceries) you pay a percentage of your income to the state on top of federal income taxes. There is no choice of whether to pay for this or not because its forced. Automatically a percentage of your income is gone to the state. So removing the state income tax will keep that percentage of money in the pockets of the taxpayer. 

The left argue that the sales tax always hurts the poor but lets look at basic across the board sales tax. A sales' tax of 5% is the same for whether you buy a 20 dollar meal ($1) compared to buying a $100,000 item $5,000. There is no the wealthy pay less and the poor pay more. In addition the sales tax is voluntary with purchases than automatically forced on top of income earned. 

So why do the left believe that having a state income tax is better for the poor when they are still double taxed?

I was poking around similar subreddits and I found [an interesting article about Niccolo Machiavelli](http://www.historytoday.com/blog/2013/02/machiavelli-not-so-machiavellian). Earlier this year the arrest warrant for Machiavelli was rediscovered in Florence's archives, issued in 1513. Here's the [BBC piece about it](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-21470077), with a Q&amp;A video with the researcher.

What it helps illustrate is that our view of Machiavelli may be greatly distorted. His arrest and torture was right before he wrote *The Prince*- a work he dedicates to those that punished him after the fall of the Florentine republic. Looking at his psychology, we can see a broken man trying to rebuild his life- and thus an attempt to curry favor with his new rulers. Also, because of the fame of *The Prince*, we ignore his later work that favors republicanism over savvy monarchy. Thus using the word ""Machiavellian"" could be a disservice to his life and ideology.

I use this example because part of neutral politics is looking at, critiquing, and perhaps debunking conventional wisdom. The great thinkers of our time may be greatly distorted, or overemphasized, or ignored all together. In modern American classrooms, Thomas Paine is a key part of all history textbooks- but until the 20th century he was reviled as a anti-religion radical, and all but forgotten by the time he died. Paine's work remains the same, but how he would be referenced has shifted.

1351404080.0,29,self.NeutralPolitics,127jo2,Is the revolving door really a bad thing?,35,6,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/127jo2/is_the_revolving_door_really_a_bad_thing/,"The [revolving door phenomenon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolving_door_(politics)) is often spoken of as a form of corruption. High-level government workers go on to become executives in companies that they once regulated, or lobbyists towards the next person to take their post. Inevitably, intimate contact between government and business leads to conflicts of interest and corporate influence on regulations and policy. 

But here's the thing: [questionable timing](http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/11/f-c-c-commissioner-to-join-comcast/) aside, is there anything inherently wrong with the revolving door? Many high-level government officials are recognized experts in their fields. They probably worked extensively in the private sector before joining the public sector, and for them to return to the private sector is only to be expected. The money they earn in the private sector is probably far more than what they make working for the government. Is it right to say that they can't work in the private sector just because they've worked in the public sector? 

Many countries, such as the US, put restrictions in place to make sure that former officials don't lobby in the area of policy they previously worked on. Time restrictions on lobbying are also placed on former public sector workers (though tellingly high-level officials are excluded from such restrictions). Should these restrictions be more strict? France has a three-year ban, while the US has a one year ban and Australia has none. What kind of restrictions should be implemented?

In my opinion, there's nothing inherently wrong with the revolving door. There needs to be tighter regulations on the relationship between government officials and companies while they're *in* office. Once they *leave*, however, they should be free to do what they want without carrying around past baggage. Of course, scenarios like a corporation promising a job to a government official for after they leave the public sector should be severely punished. 

I've also heard a theory that the revolving door discourages financial corruption while *in* office; I'm not sure if I agree. Supposedly, someone who knows they can make big bucks when they leave office based on the contacts and experience they've gained while in office is less likely to risk the consequences of mis-allocating public funds and such. If being in government is your only opportunity to rake in the cash, of course you'll take it. But if it's only a stepping stone to something better in the private sector, you'll do your public duty well in anticipation for the future. 

I've heard this in the context of corruption in China. Chinese officials are given low wages and aren't allowed many of the post-government opportunities American officials are. ""Retired"" Chinese officials don't become lobbyists or executives; instead, they hang on to power as long as possible, until they can't hang on anymore. Once you've left public office, you're done (unless you're someone like Deng Xiaoping, I suppose). Perhaps because of this, many Chinese officials view public office as the best opportunity to accumulate wealth (on the side, of course). There's a real mentality of ""I have to get as much possible while I still have the opportunity"".

Despite these legal provisions, Hong Kong is a frontline in the battle for democratic rule and civil rights. The history of post-handover Hong Kong is not one of democratic rule. The executive head of a the area was [picked by the Beijing political elite](http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2013/07/hong-kong-nationals-protest-beijing-in-annual-march/) and though “Beijing has promised that Hong Kong citizens will be able to pick their own chief executive …no later than 2017 and pick an entire legislature by 2020″ it has been repeatedly delayed.

Secondly, a disclaimer of sorts. I'm Serbian, I lived in Serbia till I was 26 years old, I'm 27 now and in Australia. There's no AA in Serbia, 95% of people probably dont even know what that is. I never either benefited from it or had AA ""get in my way"" or whatever, my opinion is purely from a neutral point of view. And I disagree with it, as an idea I think it's wrong. Yes, there was a lot of discrimination towards a lot of minorities and there still is but I don't think this is the way to fight it.

 I dont belong to a minority but I like to think that if I did I wouldn't want to have that ""question mark"" hanging above my success, I would like to be certain that I earned it, deserved it unconditionally. I would also prefer and fight to be treated as an equal, which if I benefit from AA I'm not.

Obviously, someone could say ""wtf do you know about it, it's easy for you to say, you never experienced discrimination"" and that's a valid point, I guess. But I do feel the same way about some topics that are comparable to AA that are directly relevant to me.


Also, my father works in norther Canada and what he tells me about indigenous people there matches with what I have seen and heard about indigenous people people here in Australia. I'm not sure about Indians in the US. And from that, lets call it ""practical"" point of view it seems that AA didn't do them any favours. Drug use, no work ethic, drinking and all around lack of progress as a society/community is running rampant. And I do believe if AA policies of Australia and Canada didn't allow them to live their lives without almost any responsibility whatsoever a lot of them would be better off.

What do you guys think about it? 

I would also like to hear what some members of minorities think, I wanted to talk about this with someone for a long time but never had the chance.

The eradication of mosquito-borne diseases [is largely responsible for the construction of the Panama Canal,](http://ocp.hul.harvard.edu/contagion/panamacanal.html) a project which was backed by huge financial resources and motivation.

In 1952 and 1953, the U.S. experienced [serious polio outbreaks,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polio_vaccine) leading commercial interests to invest heavily in producing and marketing a vaccine. By 1955, Salk's injectable polio vaccine was being distributed, and by 1962, Sabin's oral vaccine was licensed for production and as a result, polio was eradicated in the US by 1979. An intensive global effort to eradicate the disease began in 1988.

In 1979, scientists certified that [smallpox had been eradicated globally,](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aso/databank/entries/dm79sp.html), marking the only time in history that a human disease has been wiped from existence. The effort was a huge, 30-year undertaking organized by the WHO and funded largely by UN member states.

Currently, the Gates Foundation is investing over a billion dollars to combat disease in the developing world.

What do all these efforts have in common? The first obvious answer is money. It has required significant financial resources to combat these diseases. But that doesn't explain the whole picture.

What else comes into play when undertaking massive public health programs like this? How important are factors like stable government, educated populace, organizational capability and public support?

I think it is fair to assume that the average pro-gun individual doesn't want to pass a law banning any type of gun currently legal. I believe it is also fair to assume the average anti-gun individual doesn't want to start arming guards in elementary schools and malls to protect against tragedies like what happened at Sandy Hook.

Now for the strange similarity in my opinion. For this thought experiment one must put there emotional feelings about the subject aside and answer the questions strictly as they are asked, not including any emotions one has about whether or not they agree with the proposed idea. 

Imagine if there had been an armed guard in Sandy Hook. One that was trained to protect against this type of tragedy. Would this tragedy have happened? If the shooting still happened, would it have been nearly as deadly? The answer, in my opinion, is undeniably no to at least one of those questions. Had there been an armed guard prepared to prevent a shooting this deadly, I find it hard to believe it still would have happened to the degree that it did. Now, if you point out this fact to a anti-gun individual how do they react? More than likely they are completely against this solution. But why? If they actually thought about it, wouldn't they have to agree that an armed guard could prevent or at least lessen tragedies like this from happening? The reason they disagree with this solution, is simply based on principle. They know that this solution could be effective in countering this problem, but they instantly disagree with it simply based on principle. They do not want to spread the use of guns, no matter what the reason. 

But what does this same anti-gun crowd say about pro-gun individuals? They likely despise them because of their principled belief that government shouldn't have the power to take their guns away even though it could help protect against tragedies like this.

In my opinion you have two sides hating the opposing side because of their principled belief. Even though both sides have a reasonable argument in a possible way to counter these tragedies.

tl;dr would armed guards in places like sandy hook prevent or lessen the tragedy? if yes, then why are anti-gun individuals against them? principle. would taking away or banning certain guns prevent or lessen tragedies like sandy hook? if yes, then why are pro-gun individuals against them? principle.

Thanks for listening. I'm sure there are some logical fallacies in this argument, so I am expressing the way I have thought about it to see how it is incorrect. Please critique.

I've always found that disappointing, because it's the entry point to politics on reddit. Politics predates the founding of the United States by thousands of years, so it shouldn't solely revolve around the US.

So this week will be **International Week**, where posts about Asia, Africa, Oceania, South America, and trans-national topics are encouraged. It's not mandatory, but encouraged.

Perhaps your neighbor is very interested in socialized medicine, but you are not. Surely it wouldn't be hard to tax the ""socialized medicine"" neighbor a higher amount, but in return he gets rights to a system that others, who choose not to pay the tax, are not entitled to?

There has been a fair amount of discussion recently about appropriate taxation levels for earnings from investments (i.e. The Buffet Rule).  The argument against taxing investment income like wage income is that people investing in the stock market help to grow the economy.   How exactly?

At an IPO (initial public offering), the company sells a bunch of stock out to the world.  For every share that gets sold in the IPO, the company gets $X which the company can then use to grow.  Fair enough.   (I'm going to ignore the fact that most IPO shares are initially undervalued so that friends of the brokering house can flip them on opening day and make a tidy profit.)

Every other transaction that happens within the stock market is somebody buying a piece of stock from somebody else selling it.  The originally issuing company doesn't realize any gains from a 3rd party person selling it to another 3rd party at a 2x  or 3x mark-up from the IPO.

I don't have exact numbers, but I would guess that IPOs represent only 1% or less of the total volume of trades in any given day.  Most people and institutions who are earning money by stock trades are not necessarily giving money to a new company looking to bring in new capital.

Both the Congressional Budget Office and economists and [journalists](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/post/fact-checking-the-ryan-budget-plan/2011/04/05/AFIaZpnC_blog.html) were highly skeptical of the math and reasoning behind its claims.

One of many similar excerpts from [the Economist](http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2011/04/americas_budget_deficit) puts it: 

&gt; Its projections of the economic impact are also surreal. To be sure, the plan is not as severe as Britain’s: the deficit is only 1.7 percentage points of GDP smaller in 2015 than under Mr Obama’s 2012 budget. Economic growth would be dented, but not grievously. Yet Mr Ryan, citing analysis by the Heritage Foundation, claims his plan would actually create 1m additional private sector jobs and slash the unemployment rate to 4% by 2015, compared to the Blue Chip private sector consensus of 6.6%.


The two citations I used are both overviews more than a full on assault of Ryan's plan- which had the biggest failing of replacing Medicare with a system that doesn't actually work at all a few years down the road (pegging vouchers to inflation, rather than the much higher cost of care).

**I don't want to make this about the Ryan plan though, just a hefty example.**

Unions as a concept are a good thing, since it is important that workers are not taken advantage of. However, this works in the private sector since the success of the workers is tied to the success of the company. If the company fails, the workers lose their jobs. With such a system workers have to be careful in what they demand, since if they push too hard then the company will no longer be viable and will go under.

In the federal sector, this is not the case. Since they are decoupled from market forces, federal unions do not have to worry about their business going under. The success of the workers is no longer linked with that of the business. In establishing such a system, the argument concludes, we set up enormous potential for waste and inefficiency.

A former ROK Major General, Park led a coup in 1961 that established himself as ruler of the country until 1979, when he was assassinated. He is seen as the man responsible for bringing stability to a chaotic nation and rapidly developing its economy, creating successful *chaebols* like Samsung and Hyundai. He's also known for dealing with threats to the government both within and without with little regard for human rights. 

What's most interesting to me is the generational gap in perceptions of Park. The older generation seems to support him, while the younger Koreans tend to view him more negatively. The same can be said of leaders like Meles Zenawi of Ethiopia, whose recent death spurred a lot of debate over his legacy. 

The idea that a country could ""need"" a dictator, at least at first, tends to make people uncomfortable, but examples abound of countries caught in vicious cycles of political chaos, violence, and economic decay that is only ended when a strongman takes power. Dictatorships tend to be oppressive, but they also tend to be stable. By establishing a monopoly on violence, they fulfill one of the basic responsibilities of a state. Even better if those in power manage to invest in infrastructure, education, healthcare, and other basic services, as in the case of Paul Kagame of Rwanda (though, as with Zenawi, whether he should be called a dictator is subject to fierce debate). 

Robert Kaplan is the author I am most familiar with who often argues for the idea of a ""[virtuous dictator](http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/403b2920-450a-11e0-80e7-00144feab49a.html#axzz2FZWTJjSa)"". According to Kaplan, countries often need dictators to establish basic security and development, until the people become wealthy and comfortable enough to demand political participation and overthrow those who had brought them their middle-class comforts in the first place. The idea that strong leadership that brooks no dissent is necessary for a country's development can also be found in Lee Kwan Yew and Mahathir Mohamad's idea of ""Asian values"", and even in the so-called ""China model"" of development. I also see parallels with Vladimir Putin, whose domestic critics, very ironically, tend to hail from the middle class he helped create after Yeltsin's mismanagement of the Russian economy.

Of course, there's no guarantee that a dictatorship wouldn't simply be extractive, as with the likes of Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire. The ones that are established in countries with a long history and strong identity seem to work best, because the dictator doesn't have to play ethnic and religious factions off against each other, thereby further dividing and weakening the country, to remain in power. 

Ben Franklin once said ""They who can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety."" [[1]](http://www.ushistory.org/franklin/quotable/quote04.htm). It's an oft-quoted statement, but I doubt old Ben truly understood what a splintered country devoid of basic security is like. When the land is filled with bandits and warlords, religious fanatics and ethnic factionalists, what hope is there for democracy?

So I won't expand. 



Serious question:



**At what point does liberal bias become just idiom for anything contrary to the right-wing ideology of the moment?**



Everyone's bias. But, I try not to walk around in a box daily, calling myself liberal, conservative, libertarian, etc. As I believe it isn't necessary, and actually under serving to critical thought. I do however, have consensus with many liberal/progressive views. However, my expressions rise from my own personal judicial review of facts and not the liberality of the viewpoint.
So the question arises from a /r/neuralpolitics discussion about where people get their news from. I saw a good amount of comments suggesting that NPR, PBS, etc. were partisan groups that were obviously, given, liberal.

I believe that biases based on reporting document-able evidence shouldn't be categorized as liberal leaning (which is what I feel like is happening in today’s partisan environment, based on the lack of tangible evidence that NPR does not make every attempt to be non-partisan). Unless of course you define liberal leaning as fact based, at which point you can stop here. Question answered. While I don’t consider the latter to be true, I’ll start with my definition of liberal leaning: meaning, biased towards liberal viewpoints in an overt or covert manner.

I think ""liberal"" now has been subconsciously defined as the opposite of conservative. From what I hear of NPR they go out of their way to provide platform to (in my bias viewpoint) some of the silliest conservative, echo-chamber, talking points out there, even if there is irrefutable evidence that they are inaccurate. They then usually point out the contested views in their reporting and leave it for the listener's judgment. Which(in my opinion) is actually +1 for the silly non fact based talking point, which subtracted time from an actually credible, fact based debate on both sides.
In science you keep ""law"" and ""theory"" separate at all times. A theory attempts to explain the phenomenon of law, but never becomes the law itself. You don't separate the law into two separate truths. Saying I report the law and the theory as one truth (conservative) and then report the law, minus the theory as another (liberal) because I did not include theory in my evidence.

While I adamantly agree there is absolutely such a thing as ""liberal bias"". It is itself blatantly so, and distinguishable from fact reporting. However, I feel as if it's increasing in occurrence now that if you report discernible facts and truths without the conservative echo chamber spin you are placed subconsciously into a de-facto state of liberal preference. Which in itself, I do not define as ""liberal"".
To digress, I also see the same mishap with bipartisanship. Which I hear touted as the Rosetta Stone of lawmaking. For example, If you ask me to blow up a major city... and in sake of bipartisanship I meet you half way and say lets just blow up a city block. I think that both conclusions in general were not (in my moral terms) the right decision. I think that's a problem in today's political spectrum.. trying to compromise with (in my opinion) crazy shit.
I think the goal of neutral politics, and bipartisanship should be to make the baseline debate and discussion have platform of discernible facts. Not just saying something is liberal because it's not conservative, or conservative, because it's not liberal. Because, to be honest they're just two words and imaginary ideologies that have not conscious power over data and evidence.

**TL; DR: Stepping outside the conservative bubble isn't synonymous with liberal bias. Bipartisanship isn't synonymous with ideal solutions.**

&gt;The problem with ideology is, if you've got an ideology, you've already got your mind made up. You know all the answers and that makes evidence irrelevant and arguments a waste of time. You tend to govern by assertion and attacks. - Bill Clinton

-----

**Is this a subreddit for people who are politically neutral?**

No - in fact we welcome and encourage any viewpoint to engage in discussion. The idea behind r/NeutralPolitics is to set up a neutral space where those of differing opinions can come together and rationally lay our respective arguments. We are neutral in that no political opinion is favored here - only facts and logic. Your post or comment will be judged not by its perspective, but by its style, rationale, and informational content.

At this subreddit, we want to allow people who disagree on something to work it out between themselves in the interest of mutual understanding. If understanding truly cannot be reached (which is sometimes the case), we recommend that the conversation only continue as long both sides maintain decorum and feel that they are benefiting from the interaction. The mods will allow you to debate as long as it is civil, but sometimes it is best to part ways with a respectful “Good day, sir”. The choice lies in your good judgment.

Finally, try your best in a conversation to understand the other person’s perspective and determine rationally whether it makes sense. Take time to consider what they are saying. **Do not read a reply with the assumption that the other person is wrong**. Look for points that make sense and acknowledge them. Look for points that you can disprove and lay out your counterargument and evidence. Through this attitude, your discussion can be constructive and informative for both parties involved.

-----

**So you’re personally not politically neutral? Well…can I still make Futurama jokes?**

I have no strong feelings one way or the other.

**Are world events allowed, or is r/NeutralPolitics region specific?**

Our subreddit has a global scope, and the politics of any region is equally valued for conversation. Keep in mind, though, that if not many other redditors are located in the region that you are posting about, we won’t necessarily understand your topic. If that’s the case, make sure to post informative links so that we could all get a chance to learn more and then discuss it. Also, please indicate in the title what region or nation-state you are talking about to clarify your discussion and avoid misunderstanding.

Related note: in the comments, don’t assume a United States-centric point of view. Other people may not understand or have the same legal system or governmental structures.

-----

**I want to post a news article that I saw on a larger subreddit. Is that okay?**

Conversations on the larger political subreddits can often be disappointing, so it is perfectly acceptable to repost a news article here. In fact, it is encouraged! The goal is for r/NeutralPolitics to be a legitimate alternative to subreddits like r/politics, and that means that we need more than just discussion - we need current events, too. Just remember two things: use a different source for the story if the linked content is heavily biased or overly emotional and avoid copying the post title unless you have verified that it meets our standards.

-----

**There sure is a lot of weight placed on evidence and information here. Why is that?**

When discussing practical political issues, it is easy to get involved in emotional arguments and assumptions. By emphasizing that your argument is only as good as the data and/or logic that supports it, we remove the emotional element that leads to bickering and flame wars. It is much easier to argue information than it is to argue feelings, and we walk away from the former not angry, but with a better understanding of the world around us. **The goal here isn’t to prove that you are right.** It is to find out if you are right. This doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t defend your position, but it does mean that you should acknowledge when you have been presented with enough logical evidence to bring that position into question.

-----

**What kind of evidence should I use?**

The best sources of information would be peer-reviewed, academic sources (if you are linking to one, however, make sure that it is publicly accessible - many cannot be viewed off of a college campus without a subscription). Periodicals and news articles are also fine, but make sure to read multiple sources in order to check for information that might be left out. We will delete anything referencing Wikipedia, so if you found something there, check Wikipedia's references rather than linking directly. It's one extra step, but that's not very difficult and helps to build the strength of your claim. Also, remember that other users may question and critique your evidence. This isn't a bad thing, as that kind of thoroughness helps keep us sharp. **Never take someone's word.**

-----

**I want to have a discussion, but I don’t have evidence for my claim. However, I can rationalize my claim in a coherent way. Can I post here?**

We prefer discussions where claims can be backed by evidence, but if a civil and logical discussion can be had, we support that as well. Keep in mind that others may have evidence that disproves you, and that replies that contain relevant evidence deserve upvotes, so it is always best to research as much as you can first. If you can’t find any information, make it clear that you searched and ask if anyone can help you find some. Do your best to explain the reasoning that lead you to your current belief (because without evidence, it *is* a belief). Though this is stepping foot into the philosophical realm, at the core of politics is philosophy, so utilize reason and logic as best you can. The mods, and hopefully the community, will watch closely to make sure that these discussions are being carried out in a constructive way.These conversations can still be beneficial and intelligent (such as [this one](http://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/pquui/utilitarianism_libertarianism_or_egalitarianism/)), and we do not want to limit the scope of discussion as long as you feel that you are benefiting intellectually from it.

On that note, discussions about ethics, hypothetical scenarios, and other topics that may stray completely outside of the realm of hard evidence are welcome. All we ask is that you support your positions with defensible logic and be open and transparent with that logic. A discussion on morality that is simply, “Well I believe X” is not productive, constructive, or worthwhile. Such discussions will be deleted. Try your best to explain why you believe what you do. As debates on morality can be particularly personal, **it is important to remember not to downvote someone simply because you disagree with their opinion**.  Remember to practice good reasoning. Avoid logical fallacies, and be open minded to other views.

-----

**Am I going to get looked down upon if I ‘lose’ a debate?**

Admitting that you are wrong does not mean that you have failed - it means that you have successfully put your ego aside and adapted to new information in a way that few are able to. None of us can know everything, and sometimes you’ll get a new perspective that seriously challenges your current viewpoint on the issue at hand. Since we emphasize an empirical approach to political discussion at r/NeutralPolitics, we encourage community members to keep an open mind and approach debates not with the intention of ‘winning’, but rather with the intention of informing themselves and their conversation partner.

Remember: **your opinions are not a part of your identity**. They are conclusions drawn from experience and evidence, and should never be cemented beyond the possibility of changing. As Paul Graham said in [this](http://www.paulgraham.com/identity.html) fantastic article, ""the more labels you have for yourself, the dumber they make you.""

If you see someone displaying this intellectual maturity and changing their perspective based on new evidence, upvote them! It's not an easy thing to do.

Furthermore, endless economic growth is not sustainable. Economic growth is strongly linked to resources and energy (see [this](http://physics.ucsd.edu/do-the-math/2011/07/galactic-scale-energy/) and [this](http://physics.ucsd.edu/do-the-math/2011/07/can-economic-growth-last/)) and, given limited resources and physical constraints on energy growth, we therefore cannot have economic growth.

An idea that has been raised in some quarters (especially in light of rising inequality) is basing affirmative action on economic status rather than race see (see the articles I have linked to). Thus instead of universities reserving places for certain minorities they would do so for the economically disadvantaged regardless of colour or gender.

1341951497.0,25,self.NeutralPolitics,wcgfu,Mixed sortition as an improvement to democracy OR Why you should randomly selected to go to Congress,29,4,46,http://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/wcgfu/mixed_sortition_as_an_improvement_to_democracy_or/,"""In today's news, Agatha Brodzinski, a 46 year old nurse from Hackensack, NJ, was randomly selected to join the 115th United States Congress. ""I am so very surprised by all of this,"" said the mother of three, ""but I am willing and ready to serve my country as best I can"", she added enthusiastically.  Agatha first got the news while she was walking her Irish Setter, Ramona, when she got the call. ""I could hardly believe it"", she said, ""you hear on the news this person or that person got selected but you never think it could happen to me."" Agatha would serve for two years receiving the regular salary and benefits of a US representative.""    

The proposal I am presenting is one of mixed sortition. That is, in addition to the democratically elected politicians of the status quo, this proposal would add some number of randomly assigned individuals to both houses of Congress. Please keep in mind that the details, while worthwhile to debate, are offered simply to frame the discussion for the larger questions on hand. These details are the following:  

 
* The pool of candidates is selected from those who currently or previously had state licenses or identifications and from voter registration (no duplication so all individuals have equal probability)
* The number of sortition selected representatives is 200 in the House and 100 in the Senate (exact number not important). 
* The selected House seats are to be distributed according to state population.
* The selected Senate seats are each allocated to one state regardless of population. 
* The requirements for the respective houses remain the same (age, citizenship, etc.) and the compensation is the same ($174,000 salary plus benefits).  

 
So far I've left out the most important question of all: ""Why?""  

 
An oft-quoted sentiment is that those who want to (or able to) get elected are seldom the type of people who should be in power. The barrier to elected office is a high and costly one. According to the Center for Responsive Politics 47% of Congressional members are millionaires.  This is no coincidence. Our politicians are not only beholden to their constituents, but also to their contributors that allow them to raise the millions necessary to win campaigns.  

 
Though elections are certainly preferable to an absolute monarchy there is much left to be desired from our current democracy. A democracy hopes that politicians, in seeking their own self interest of reelection, appeal to voters' self interest with either promises or past evidence of some tangible good.  Somewhere along the way things got less than perfect.  Either because of special interests or because of the seemingly inevitable polarization the first-past-the-post voting system engenders.  

 
The benefits of mixed sortition are numerous. First of all, it would add diversity to Congress on many different levels. The candidates chosen via sortition are much more likely to proportionally represent the nation. Currently, only 16.8% of Congress is made up of women though they make up 50% of the population. Similar gains would be seen for racial and class diversity. This would result in a more representative government. In addition, sortition representatives do not belong to the political machine; they owe no favors to interest groups or party leadership. This allows them to more objectively view issues. Furthermore, not all their decisions are political because they need not think of reelection.  

 
Concerns:
Is the pool of candidates sufficiently wide or too wide? Under no circumstances did I want to submit candidates to qualification test of any sort. In addition, I wanted the most reasonably broad pool of candidates with verifiable information. What are problems with the current pool as suggested?  

 
What kind of people would accept? Keep in mind it would be a *huge* time commitment. But then again a yearly salary of $174,000 plus benefits would be a great incentive to take the job. How seriously would they take the job and how effective would they be?  

 
Probably most important of all, is this type of system even desirable? There is a part of me that would *love* to see average people go to Congress. Not suits, talking heads, or spin experts, just everyday people yet unadulterated by the political process. How influenced will they be by the party leadership, the expert witnesses, and the capitol bureaucrats?

The advantage is that it helps maintain the political relevance of sparsely populated areas by lumping geographically large rural areas with geographically small urban areas and forcing candidates to campaign in both places.

The main disadvantage, however, is that voters who contradict the majority of the state, especially in stronghold states, have no incentive to vote. For example, liberals in North Dakota and conservatives in Hawaii can effectively consider their vote useless, as the state's electoral votes won't go their way.

I think the simple answer is that it is because ignoring the concept of amendments makes all their jobs easier and more important.

The result is that we haven't had an amendment [since the 27th... which was about lawmaker's pay in the early 90s](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-seventh_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution). Before that it was the [26th about the right to vote at 18 - in 1971!](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-sixth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution)... the 25th was about the [pecking order of command - in 1967](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-fifth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution)... [and finally the 24th in 1962 ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-fourth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution) - The civil rights amendment which is the first of the amendments I have listed that I fell is of actual importance (maybe with the exception of the 18 year old right to vote).

I feel that the [9th amendment](http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/9th+Amendment) - called an ""enigma"" in this link, which in my opinion is hysterical and further proof that politicians and legal ""minds"" are creating this  dirge against the concept of amending the constitution and in favor of ""interpreting"" the existing document however they see fit- and the [10th amendment](http://encyclopedia.thefreedictionary.com/10th+Amendment), which I've never heard used in a judicial decision that states ""This right is reserved to the people as stated in the 10th amendment"", have you? - and of course Article 5, the [specific directions on how to amend the constitution](http://encyclopedia.thefreedictionary.com/Article+Five+of+the+United+States+Constitution) are all the parts of the constitution that lead me to believe that the people who wrote the constitution *intended* for more amendments to be created.

Are there any instances of implementation?,28,7,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/1d2ztv/what_are_the_merits_and_drawbacks_of_global/,"I read about [global licensing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DADVSI#The_.22global_license.22) in the Wikipedia article on DADVSI in France. It seems like a relatively logical idea but its never even brought up in the mainstream copyright debate.

The basic idea is that Internet users would be entirely freed from any restriction on media downloading, copying, modifying, and sharing, for a meager fee paid to their ISP every month (it was proposed as €7/mo on Internet plans that cost €30 on average in France). The ISP would turn around and give that money to the govt. (or potentially some independent commission/organization) who would redistribute the money to those artists. 

As far as I can tell, here are the issues at hand:

**PROS**

- It would allow for greater bet compensation of artists and lower prices of entertainment for consumers.

- It would even further decrease dependence of artists on record labels for distribution. (*I'll come back to this*)

- It's more realistic that Internet users would follow this, since they'll be downloading illegally no matter what if the law stays the same

- Replaces the clunky and obtrusive DRM system as we have it.

**CONS**

- Difficult to track which artists deserve to be paid more and which deserve to be paid less. Simple polling would likely ignore the smaller artists. (*I'll come back to this too*)

- *Might* fail to adequately repay artists.

- It's communist and DRM allows for adequate individual apportionment of proceeds. 

-Contrary to the 'Test in Three Steps', which turned out to be the biggest and most important issue in striking down this idea in the case of DADVSI.

My thoughts go a few ways here:

First, the increased independence from record labels would mean that the RIAA would likely shit their pants if this bill ever came up. So, going forward, it's probably not useful, at least as a primary argument, to worry about political viability.

Second, at least in the system that exists in America, big artists make significantly more money off of concerts/tours than record sales, so a system like this likely wouldn't hurt them terribly, while it would massively help out smaller artists.

Personally I completely don't understand. As a former ICU nurse, I've seen a lot of people at the opposite end of the spectrum where divisions between life &amp; death can also be blurred - when they are on the brink of death.  Heartbeat is never considered to be the medically defining factor in determining if someone is alive - brain death is.  If heartbeat were considered the defining factor in whether someone is alive or not, we could never have heart transplants.

{ **Side note: I hope this doesn't seem riddled with bias, the idea of free will is not difficult to undermine, but as I'm sure lots of you would disagree you can go over instead why people should be punished without any apparent philosophy interfering. Let's just be sensible ;p** }



If it doesn't exist, how can we justify the retribution our legal systems carefully orbit?

For people who don't want to watch the video (which is great; I've been trying to smuggle this guy onto reddit for awhile) here's the gist:

*it* -no free will- *does call the logic of retribution into question. Clearly we need to build prisons for people who are intent upon harming others, but if we could incarcerate earthquakes and hurricanes for their crimes we would build prisons for them as well. The men and women on death row have some combination of bad genes, bad parents, bad ideas and bad luck. Which of these quantities exactly were they responsible for? No human being stands as author to his own genes or his upbringing, and yet we have reason to believe that these factors determine his character throughout life. Our system of justice should reflect our understanding that each of us could have been dealt a very different hand in life; if fact it seems immoral not realize how much luck is involved in morality itself. Consider what would happen if we discovered a cure for human evil:*

*Imagine for the sake of argument that every relevant change in the human brain can be made cheaply, painlessly, and safely. The cure for psychopathy could be put directly into the food supply like vitamin D; evil is now nothing more than a nutritional deficiency. If we imagine that the cure for evil exists we can see that our retributive impulse is profoundly flawed. Consider for instance the prospect of withholding the cure for human evil from a murderer as part of his punishment. Would this make any moral sense at all?*

We hear constant calls for moderation, compromise for politicians to govern from the centre, there was even an [attempt](http://www.americanselect.org/) last year to build a grass roots centrist movement which failed.

Might it not better, as happened in these previous eras, that politics and politicians be contentious and vigorously contested rather than settle on a mutually loathed middle ground. 

As the Washington post article puts it the centre 
&gt;""is not the center of public opinion. It’s more a reference to an amorphous Washington consensus.

&gt;**Article 10 – Freedom of expression**

&gt;Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers. This article shall not prevent States from requiring the licensing of broadcasting, television or cinema enterprises.

&gt;The exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with it duties and responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society, in the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, for the protection of the reputation or rights of others, for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence, or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary.

I'm curious as to what neutralpolitickers think of this view and what other research exists that seeks to explain political leanings on the basis of fundamental beliefs common to all humans.  The common idea that conservatives are continually duped to vote against their own interests seems dubious.  His assertions make sense given that research has shown that people tend to make decisions based on emotions (the 'gut' feeling) and then justify these decisions with cherry-picked facts later.

The foreign aids and military interventions of most developed countries towards other countries reflect a belief that a citizen's life is more important than the lives of a large number of noncitizens. Similarly, the immigration and trade policies reflect a view that a small increase in the standard of living of a citizen is more important than a much larger increase for a noncitizen.

Why is thinking and acting like this acceptable with regard to the country one was born in, but totally unacceptable with regards to, say, race? 

To my eye, US law discriminates against Mexican nationals in a similar manner to how apartheid South Africa discriminated against non-whites.  For the most part, it prevents them from working in the US, denies them the right to vote in the US and deports those that do come. Those deported are sent back to an area where they have lower quality health care, schools, employment opportunities, et cetera. We have segregation in that we force one group to live in a completely different country.

Many of the justifications for these restrictions are also similar. If US law didn't discriminate against Mexican nationals, millions would migrate. This would change the social structure of the US, perhaps cause an increase in crime, and probably decrease wages for low-skill American workers.

What am I missing? Why is discriminating based on citizenship acceptable as a world view and as government policy?

(To be clear, this isn't meant to justify apartheid or racism but rather to question nationalism.)

*EDIT1* 

I've replied to a bunch of posts. My replies were intended to be provacative and spark discussion. I've seen posts I agree with, but I have only seen a couple of posts that defend US immigration policy in a way that couldn't be rationally used to defend apartheid. 

*EDIT2*

Thanks everyone for the great responses. I'm sorry I haven't been able to reply. I'm currently in a country where the average income is less than a dollar a day and internet access is correspondingly spotty. 

Perhaps that was why I started this discussion - my guilt at spending thousands of dollars a month on frivolities, while so many people lack basic necessities.

SCOTUS did not say the ACA fit in the commerce clause, it fit within the power of congress to levy taxes. You can look at the full pdf of the decisions [here](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/11pdf/11-393c3a2.pdf).

The assenting opinion by the four more liberal judges said that it did, but in the official 5-4 opinion of the court with Roberts in support, it did not.  

Summary of some important bits:

**From majority opinion (Roberts)**

&gt; Congress already possesses expansive power to regulate what people do. Upholding the Affordable Care Act under the Commerce Clause would give Congress the same license to regulate what people do not do. The Framers knew the difference between doing something and doing nothing. They gave Congress the power to regulate commerce, not to compel it. Ignoring that distinction would undermine the prin- ciple that the Federal Government is a government of limited and enumerated powers. The individual mandate thus cannot be sus- tained under Congress’s power to “regulate Commerce.”
 
...

&gt; Nor can the individual mandate be sustained under the Necessary and Proper Clause as an integral part of the Affordable Care Act’s other reforms.

...

&gt; The most straightforward reading of the individual mandate is that it commands individuals to purchase insurance. But, for the reasons explained, the Commerce Clause does not give Congress that power. It is therefore necessary to turn to the Government’s alternative argument: that the mandate may be upheld as within Congress’s power to “lay and collect Taxes.” Art. I, §8, cl. 1. In pressing its taxing power argument, the Government asks the Court to view the mandate as imposing a tax on those who do not buy that product. Because “every reasonable construction must be resorted to, in order to save a statute from unconstitutionality,” Hooper v. California, 155 U. S. 648, 657, the question is whether it is “fairly possible” to interpret the mandate as imposing such a tax, Crowell v. Benson, 285 U. S. 22, 62. Pp. 31–32.
4. CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Part III–C, concluding that the individual mandate may be upheld as within Congress’s power under the Taxing Clause. Pp. 33– 44.

...

&gt; The Affordable Care Act’s requirement that certain individuals pay a financial penalty for not obtaining health insurance may reasonably be characterized as a tax. Because the Constitution permits such a tax, it is not our role to forbid it, or to pass upon its wisdom or fairness.

**From the Ginsburg opinion:**

&gt; The provision of health care is today a concern of na­ tional dimension, just as the provision of old-age and survivors’ benefits was in the 1930’s. In the Social Secu- rity Act, Congress installed a federal system to provide monthly benefits to retired wage earners and, eventually, to their survivors. Beyond question, Congress could have adopted a similar scheme for health care. Congress chose, instead, to preserve a central role for private insurers and state governments. According to THE CHIEF JUSTICE, the Commerce Clause does not permit that preservation. This rigid reading of the Clause makes scant sense and is stunningly retrogressive.

&gt; For the reasons stated, I agree with THE CHIEF JUSTICE that, as to the validity of the minimum coverage provi­sion, the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit should be reversed. In my view, the provision encounters no constitutional obstruction. Further, I would uphold the Eleventh Circuit’s decision that the Medicaid expansion is within Congress’ spending power.

**From the dissent (Kennedy):**

&gt; A few respectful responses to JUSTICE GINSBURG’s dis- sent on the issue of the Mandate are in order. That dis- sent duly recites the test of Commerce Clause power that our opinions have applied, but disregards the premise the test contains. It is true enough that Congress needs only a “‘rational basis’ for concluding that the regulated activity substantially affects interstate commerce,” ante, at 15 (emphasis added). But it must be activity affecting commerce that is regulated, and not merely the failure to engage in commerce. And one is not now purchasing the health care covered by the insurance mandate simply because one is likely to be purchasing it in the future. Our test’s premise of regulated activity is not invented out of whole cloth, but rests upon the Constitution’s requirement that it be commerce which is regulated. If all inactivity affecting commerce is commerce, commerce is everything.

...

&gt; The Court today decides to save a statute Congress did
not write. It rules that what the statute declares to be a requirement with a penalty is instead an option subject to a tax. And it changes the intentionally coercive sanc- tion of a total cut-off of Medicaid funds to a supposedly noncoercive cut-off of only the incremental funds that the Act makes available.
The Court regards its strained statutory interpretation as judicial modesty. It is not. It amounts instead to a vast judicial overreaching. It creates a debilitated, inoperable version of health-care regulation that Congress did not enact and the public does not expect. It makes enactment of sensible health-care regulation more difficult, since Congress cannot start afresh but must take as its point of departure a jumble of now senseless provisions, provisions that certain interests favored under the Court’s new design will struggle to retain. And it leaves the public and the States to expend vast sums of money on requirements that may or may not survive the necessary congressional revision.

and closing

&gt; The Constitution, though it dates from the founding of the Republic, has powerful meaning and vital relevance to our own times. The constitutional protections that this case involves are protections of structure. Structural protections—notably, the restraints imposed by federalism and separation of powers—are less romantic and have less obvious a connection to personal freedom than the provisions of the Bill of Rights or the Civil War Amendments. Hence they tend to be undervalued or even forgotten by our citizens. It should be the responsibility of the Court to teach otherwise, to remind our people that the Framers considered structural protections of freedom the most important ones, for which reason they alone were embodied in the original Constitution and not left to later amendment. The fragmentation of power produced by the structure of our Government is central to liberty, and when we destroy it, we place liberty at peril. Today’s decision should have vindicated, should have taught, this truth; instead, our judgment today has disregarded it.
For the reasons here stated, we would find the Act invalid in its entirety. We respectfully dissent.

On the one hand, it would really suck if the government could see all of your e-mails, private facebook messages, etc. without the need for a warrant (if I'm understanding the bill correctly). On the other hand, the nature of the internet is that this information must go through third parties. The only thing to stop them from sharing this information with the government anyway is a potential lawsuit, unless there's some kind of law to protect that information that I'm unaware of. If you send a postcard to a friend that says you intend to murder someone, and the mailman reads it and tells the police, how is that different from sending an e-mail via Google? I think the biggest problem is that most people (self included) don't think about the fact that everything they do on the internet is already going through a third party, but like I said, I don't know much about existing laws on this subject. I do think it would be a huge violation of privacy to FORCE companies to give people's information to the government, but that isn't what's happening here.

Information is extraordinarily difficult to find.

I know that anyone who already has health insurance ([~84.3% of the population](http://www.census.gov/prod/2010pubs/p60-238.pdf)) will not have to worry about it - as they already have health coverage. I also know that the poor (less than the Federal Poverty Level) will have coverage (through Medicare), and not have to worry about the penalty. I also know that ObamaCare is expanding Medicare to 133% of the Federal Poverty Level; so even fewer people will have to worry about it. I also know that ObamaCare will provide progressive assistance, for people making less than 400% the Federal Poverty Level, to purchase health insurance on the exchanges.

What I want to know is how much the *penalty* will actually cost someone who (for whatever reason) **doesn't have** health insurance (either through Medicare, Medicaid, employer, or individual market).

What follows is my attempts to try to start to solve the question. It is incomplete, it might be inaccurate, it is missing items. i'm hoping someone with more knowledge than me can complete the task.

i originally asked [this question on another site](http://politics.stackexchange.com/questions/1682/how-much-will-the-obamacare-tax-penalty-cost), but got no answers. Some people may love ObamaCare, some people may hate it, most people will be unaffected by the penalty, some won't. I'm hoping /r/NeutralPolitics can answer the question (and without prejudice).

---------------------

The first note is that the *""flat fee""* will ramp up over the next three years ([1][1], [2][2]):

- $95 for calendar year 2014 
- $325 in 2015
- $695 in 2016
- indexed to the federal poverty level after that

Ignoring the gradual ramp-up over the next two years (for simplicity sake), and assuming a single person filing alone (for simplicity sake), the tax liability is:

    Income  Cost
    ======  ====
    (all)   $695

Next we note that there is on exemption for people whose income is so low that they do not have to file a tax return.([3][3]) That *filing threshold*, currently $10000 for Tax Year 2013 ([4](http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxfacts/displayafact.cfm?Docid=389)), is the amount of deductions everyone gets ($3900 **personal exemption** + 6100 **standard deduction**). In other words, if your *taxable* income (income after deductions) is zero, you do not have to pay the penalty. With this information we update the chart:

    Income            Cost
    ================  ====
    0 - $10000           0  ($3900 personal exemption + $6100 standard deduction = $10000)
    $10000 and over   $695

Next is the note that the tax is actually 2.5% of your *taxable* income, or $695, whichever is greater. ([4](http://obamacarefacts.com/obamacare-taxes.php)). This is where things start to get difficult:

    Income            Taxable Income    Cost
    ================  ==============    ====
    0 - $10000        0                    0  $3900 personal exemption + $6100 standard deduction = $10000
    $10000 - $37800   0 - $27800        $695  $695 is larger than 2.5% of taxable income
    $37800 and over   $27800 and over   2.5%  Over $37800, 2.5% of taxable income dominates

Next is the note that anyone making less than 133% of the **Federal Poverty Level** (FPL) ([5](http://obamacarefacts.com/obamacare-tax-penalty.php)) is exempt. Medicare coverage will also be extended to anyone making less than 133% of the FPL. This means that you *have* health care coverage, and so do not have the pay the penalty. The 133% FPL is currently $14,856:

    Income            Taxable Income    Cost
    ================  ==============    ====
    0 - $10000        0                    0  $3900 personal exemption + $6100 standard deduction = $10000
    $10000 - 14856    0 - $4856            0  Health insurance coverage through Medicare
    $14856 - $37800   $4856 - $27800    $695  $695 is larger than 2.5% of taxable income
    $37800 and over   $27800 and over   2.5%  Over $37800, 2.5% of taxable income dominates

 Now we have the note that the fee can't be over 8% of your income; otherwise you are exempt ([6](http://obamacarefacts.com/obamacare-taxes.php)). i assume they mean 8% of *taxable* income:
 
    Income              Taxable Income    Cost
    ==================  ================    ====
    0 - $10000          0                    0  $3900 personal exemption + $6100 standard deduction = $10000; exempt
    $10000 - 14856      0 - $4856            0  Health insurance coverage through Medicare; exempt
    $14856 - $18787.50  $4856 - $8687.50     0  $695 exceeds 8% of taxable income; exempt
    $18787.50 - $37800  $8687.50 - $27800 $695  $695 is larger than 2.5% of taxable income
    $37800 and over     $27800 and over   2.5%  Over $37800, 2.5% of taxable income dominates

At some point i realize that 2.5% of your income would exceed the cost of the **Broze** plan on an exchange; and it would be cheaper to actually *buy* insurance. That is the next question: what is the **""Bronze""** plan cost, and at what income level will i become exempt from the fee, because i bought insurance.

Also, how does the government health insurance premium assistance sliding scale for people making less than 400% of the Federal Poverty Level ($44,680) affect things?

Bonus Chatter
----------------

A **""Bronze""** plan defines the minimum coverage that a health insurance plan must cost:


- Ambulatory patient services
- Emergency services
- Hospitalization
- Maternity and newborn care
- Mental health and substance use disorder services, including behavioral health treatment
- Prescription drugs
- Rehabilitative and habilitative services and devices
- Laboratory services
- Preventive and wellness services and chronic disease management
- Pediatric services, including oral and vision care

For people making up to 400% of the Federal Poverty Level ($44,679), the cost of a **Bronze** plan is capped at 9.5% of your income. That means that (at the current poverty level), the highest cost of a plan is $4,244 (cheaper than what you would currently pay for health care). People making less than 400% FPL get increased subsidizes.

A universal background check would solve the same safety issues as a national registry, have fewer, if any, potential unintended consequences, and could be almost entirely automated, thereby decreasing administrative costs. 

What (my idea of) a universal background check looks like: 

Regardless of where you live and whether it's P2P or a gun-shop, before you go to buy your first gun, you must first submit to a thorough background check. After you have passed, you now have a ""background profile,"" or whatever you want to call it. This profile only means that you applied for a profile. You did not necessarily buy the gun. That part is important. 

Now, if you go to a gun show and want to buy an AR-15, the vendor (even though it's p2p) must first ""ping"" the system. If you go to Cabelas to buy 1000 rounds of 7.62x39, Cabelas pings the system either upon checkout, or when you enter the ""ping-worthy items"" section. The ping doesn't say what you are looking to buy, and is anonymous for the vendor doing the pinging. If your ping comes back clean, you can buy the gun, and the government is none the wiser. If the ping doesn't come back clean, the vendor doesn't know why, and you have an opportunity for appeal. 

The profiles could update automatically. The establishment of this database would coincide with policy changes in prosecutor's offices across the country, that if a successful conviction coincides with any pre-determined category of ""no-more-guns-for-you"" offenses, then an update packet will be sent to your profile, and you will no longer ping clean. The same could go for mental health professionals, though I haven't yet thought out the details on who specifically in that area would be able to send update packets.

I've heard mixed stories, and how well it works depends largely on where you live.

Being from Canada, I *do* have experience with the so-called ""50 labs of innovation"" (albeit knock the number down to 13). Education is a completely provincial matter, which is what Mr. Johnson wishes to have in the US. However, I am skeptical of how well this would function in the US. In Canada, this seems to work much better in some areas than others. 

[This](http://www.ccl-cca.ca/cclflash/proseliteracy/map_canada_e.html) map shows literacy levels throughout Canada by cities. I'm not sure if the same metric is used in the US, however level 2 is the second lowest literacy level in Canada, while level 3 is the lowest minimum needed to function with the ever-increasing information demands of society, and that a score of at least 300 on a International Adult Literacy and Skills Survey is required to be employable (level 2 is 226-275 points). If you look at the map by province, it steadily gets worse the further east you travel.

I'm sure this could be attributed to many things, such as New Brunswick, PEI, and Newfoundland being more rural provinces, where most jobs are more closely related to fishing, farming, or mining (such is the case in New Brunswick and PEI, anyways). But even then, Saskatchewan and Manitoba are largely agricultural provinces, and they're doing much better (although still quite bad). Of course, I could go on and on about how the main job sources of each province may attract a certain type of person, or encourage dropping out of school early, etc, but I believe that's enough

**All this boils down to a simple question**: Would Gary Johnson's idea of relegating educational responsibilities to the states actually work? Is there a reason why it hasn't worked well in Canada, such as the people in charge being incompetent?

Big figures such as Pinochet were tried and sentenced after democracy was restored, and recently there were little bits here and there of aftermath [such as the arrest and subsequent release of Isabel Peron](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2007/jan/13/argentina.rorycarroll), but that's really it. Aside from Clinton's push to release the records that linked the US to Condor in the first place, nothing of note has really come of this.

The United States had heavy involvement in the Chilean coup that overthrew the democratically elected president in favor of a military government. And yet, the US has not been properly held accountable. We don't even hear anything about Operation Condor in our media anymore (gee thanks 9/11!), and it wasn't very long ago at all.

My question is why haven't these horrifying actions caught up with the US? From my point of view as an American only recently learning about all of this in a college setting, taking an elective course, it seems like everything was just swept under the rug. Other countries didn't even bring up the fact that we secretly overthrew a democracy in the past when the NSA thing broke! Why doesn't anyone seem to remember?

Firstly, in upholding the individual mandate as a penalty under the power of congress to tax, the hands of the IRS to enforce this were entirely tied. There are no civil or criminal penalties for failing to pay it and the only method the IRS have of recovery is via tax returns. Those who don't want the comprehensive insurance we are now mandated to buy can simply revise up their allowances to avoid receiving a return, as many already do to avoid giving the federal government an interest free loan, and won't be assessed the penalty as a result.

A number of states have passed, or are in the process of passing, laws that criminalize federal agents attempting to enforce the mandate and nullify the federal mandate entirely. In NH SB148 was passed last year stating:

&gt; No resident of this state, regardless of whether he or she has or is eligible for health insurance coverage under any policy or program provided by or through his or her employer, or a plan sponsored by the state or the federal government, shall be required to obtain or maintain a policy of individual insurance coverage except as required by a court or the department of health and human services where an individual is named a party in a judicial or administrative proceeding. No provision of this title shall render a resident of this state liable for any penalty, assessment, fee, or fine as a result of his or her failure to procure or obtain health insurance coverage. This section shall not apply to individuals voluntarily applying for coverage under a state-administered program pursuant to Title XIX or Title XXI of the Social Security Act. This section shall not apply to students being required by an institution of higher education to obtain and maintain health insurance as a condition of enrollment. Nothing in this section shall impair the rights of persons to privately contract for health insurance for family members or former family members.

Many states have also rejected &amp; returned the federal funds supplied for setting up the healthcare exchanges. While the federal government purport to be able to operate them on behalf of residents in states that don't set up exchanges states can require insurers in their states not to participate. As insurers are primarily regulated at the state level, due to historical court presidents, there is no mechanism for the federal government to override such a law. 

Another part of the decision, the no penalty decision for Medicaid, has been interpreted in two different ways by the states. Firstly Maine have used it as an opportunity to remove 20%-30% of participants from the program and other states are following suit. The second result is the [Health Care Compact](http://healthcarecompact.org) which a number of states have already joined, and others are in the process of passing legislation to join. 

The Healthcare Compact seeks to nullify all current federal healthcare programs within member states (certainly in the case of Medicare, and thus nearly all of ACA, they can do this as the program is voluntary for states) and return federal money that would have been spent on them back to the states for them to operate their own chosen healthcare systems. Vermont is looking at its own version which would allow them to use taxes collected from its citizens and then returned to start its own universal healthcare system.

Even if the states don't manage to nullify all of ACA the expansion of Medicaid is already dead. Even if they don't manage to nullify the individual mandate the enforcement is toothless and people are already being advised how to avoid incurring it entirely. In short the only provision of ACA that seems to be remaining intact is the pre-existing condition requirement for insurers, without the influx of unwilling consumers either prices will rise stratospherically or the industry will fall.

Where do you see ACA in 5 years?

I'm fairly new to this subreddit so i thought i'd express my general opinion of it first. I like the idea of it being neutral with everyone invited to a civil discussion but i can see how some might find this subred offensive as in how the general consensus here might be seen as some kind of an attempt to 'solve' political questions in a small web-community such as this one.
We are human and there are IMO always irreducably irrational motives and drives for our behavior. F.x an atheist libertarian may have put a lot of thought into his/her argument but can he give a comprehensive account for the meaning of life and solve the is-ought problem from his/her standpoint.
I like the idea of this subreddit as a mediator between opposing sides in a debate so the concept of neutrality to me really means: Balance. I welcome your thoughts on the matter.


2. So, on to the real subject, i would just like to say that i am VERY pro-drugs. I don't think it's natural to create a legal barrier that separates alcohol and tobacco(some potentially hazardous drugs) from cannabis, lsd, speed, cocaine and heroin. 
The key word here is 'potentially. It feels to me as if the debate on the legal status of drugs has been watered down and spoon-fed to regular, impressionable people like you and me and turned into a propaganda campaign for marijuana. Marijuana probably has the potential to induce paranoia and anxiety in some people. 
Cocaine can cause death in large doses and those LARGE doses are even more dangerous to people with heart problems. In LARGE doses(1/20th of a lethal dose produces the desired effects) heroin kills and people die from it generally because they don't know what they're doing. They go all-in, have some booze with it, buy product they don't have any real info on.
 And that's why they die. That's why moonshine is more dangerous than red wine.
 So, in a nutshell my opinion is that legalizing pot to spare people prison-time and get the economy going is nowhere near as urgent as legalizing hard drugs. 
There is hardly any public or widely acknowledged support for this. Even the needle-exchange programs in the most devastated neighbourhoods make a positive difference, they save lives and get people on the right track as well as letting them avoid being branded felons. 

Most of the people who die from hard drug use die for no reason but society's apathy and denial towards the fact that sometimes people choose between our fucked up society and the junkie-den...and choose the latter.

 Alot of people are constantly getting worked up about the approval of marijuana legalization crawling over a 50 percent rating but ignore the plight of serious addicts maybe thinking it will all go away and saving stoners out of county prisons is more important than saving unfortunate souls from their deaths on the streets. 
Sorry for the harsh words but i think a lot of marijuana advocates should take a look in the mirror and actually practice the open-mindedness and liberalism they preach. After all, the info's on the internet...
/I would like to stress the importance of the first two articles to see where i'm coming from. We don't have people dropping like flies from paracetamol and this makes the current situation with heroin nothing more than a medieval absurdity.

To me, the basic purpose of government should be to utilize combined resources of the people to provide the best environment for people to succeed in society.  This means having provisions for the things that generally are not efficient or equitable when funded privately, ie military, police, fire, healthcare, and education.

It has come to the forefront of the U.S. presidential election of late, and there have been few suggestions to deal with what is increasingly seen as a broken system.

I would love to hear (and have some discussion on) possible suggestions to how to deal with this issue. I think the classic dichotomy that exists in the thinking on possible solutions are (this is obviously simplified) the more liberal side saying that equal access to education is essential and must preserved, while the libertarian/fiscally conservative side says that the government is increasing the cost of post-secondary education through guaranteed loans and a guarantee to equal access of education does not include economic equality (e.g. the ability to finance it). 

In light of there opposing sides, do you have a possible ""solution"" to the problem of post-secondary education in America? This could come from either hypothetical position I have very (very) broadly thrown out, but specific ways a suggestion could be implemented in the near future would be needed, including the possible short-term and long-term effects (ideally with both pros and cons). How does it (if at all) address the concerns of both philosophical sides? Do you see your suggestion as able to be implemented or are you presenting an ideal situation? If it is an ideal, how could the ideal be used to create a better system in the real world? 

In short, do you have a suggestion a system that could be implemented in the near future in America?

Personally I'm no fan of Strassel nor do I necessarily agree with this piece, but it is unusual how mum Romney (and the GOP in general) have been on Obama's use of executive power.

It makes sense, in a liberal = big government vs. conservative = small government notion, that the Democratic president would make extensive use of executive power. But the excuse of ""well Congress won't do anything so we need to get it through somehow"" doesn't ring well with me. Checks and balances in government are there for a reason, and much of the action Obama has taken ""unilaterally"" have not been life-or-death measures. Unilateral action to save a crumbling economy is one thing, but cap-and-trade via the EPA and the DREAM Act didn't have to be rushed.

**TL;DR** Obama is making exceptional use of executive privilege and general executive power.

Text:

&gt;The ObamaCare litigation is history, with the president's takeover of the health sector deemed constitutional. Now we can focus on the rest of the Obama imperial presidency.

&gt;Where, you are wondering, have you recently heard that term? Ah, yes. The ""imperial presidency"" of George W. Bush was a favorite judgment of the left about our 43rd president's conduct in war, wiretapping and detentions. Yet say this about Mr. Bush: His aggressive reading of executive authority was limited to the area where presidents are at their core power—the commander-in-chief function.

&gt;By contrast, presidents are at their weakest in the realm of domestic policy—subject to checks and balances, co-equal to the other branches. Yet this is where Mr. Obama has granted himself unprecedented power. The health law and the 2009 stimulus package were unique examples of Mr. Obama working with Congress. The more ""persistent pattern,"" Matthew Spalding recently wrote on the Heritage Foundation blog, is ""disregard for the powers of the legislative branch in favor of administrative decision making without—and often in spite of—congressional action.""

&gt;Put another way: Mr. Obama proposes, Congress refuses, he does it anyway.

&gt;For example, Congress refused to pass Mr. Obama's Dream Act, which would provide a path to citizenship for some not here legally. So Mr. Obama passed it himself with an executive order that directs officers to no longer deport certain illegal immigrants. This may be good or humane policy, yet there is no reading of ""prosecutorial discretion"" that allows for blanket immunity for entire classes of offenders.

&gt;Mr. Obama disagrees with federal law, which criminalizes the use of medical marijuana. Congress has not repealed the law. No matter. The president instructs his Justice Department not to prosecute transgressors. He disapproves of the federal Defense of Marriage Act, yet rather than get Congress to repeal it, he stops defending it in court. He dislikes provisions of the federal No Child Left Behind Act, so he asked Congress for fixes. That effort failed, so now his Education Department issues waivers that are patently inconsistent with the statute.

&gt;Similarly, when Mr. Obama wants a new program and Congress won't give it to him, he creates it regardless. Congress, including Democrats, wouldn't pass his cap-and-trade legislation. His Environmental Protection Agency is now instituting it via a broad reading of the Clean Air Act. Congress, again including members of his own party, wouldn't pass his ""card-check"" legislation eliminating secret ballots in union elections. So he stacked the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) with appointees who pushed through a ""quickie"" election law to accomplish much the same. Congress wouldn't pass ""net neutrality"" Internet regulations, so Mr. Obama's Federal Communications Commission did it unilaterally.

&gt;In January, when the Senate refused to confirm Mr. Obama's new picks for the NLRB, he proclaimed the Senate to be in ""recess"" and appointed the members anyway, making a mockery of that chamber's advice-and-consent role. In June, he expanded the definition of ""executive privilege"" to deny House Republicans documents for their probe into the botched Fast and Furious drug-war operation, making a mockery of Congress's oversight responsibilities.

&gt;This president's imperial pretensions extend into the brute force the executive branch has exercised over the private sector. The auto bailouts turned contract law on its head, as the White House subordinated bondholders' rights to those of its union allies. After the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill, the Justice Department leaked that it had opened a criminal probe at exactly the time the Obama White House was demanding BP suspend its dividend and cough up billions for an extralegal claims fund. BP paid. Who wouldn't?

&gt;And it has been much the same in his dealings with the states. Don't like Arizona's plans to check immigration status? Sue. Don't like state efforts to clean up their voter rolls? Invoke the Voting Rights Act. Don't like state authority over fracking? Elbow in with new and imagined federal authority, via federal water or land laws.

&gt;In so many situations, Mr. Obama's stated rationale for action has been the same: We tried working with Congress but it didn't pan out—so we did what we had to do. This is not only admission that the president has subverted the legislative branch, but a revealing insight into Mr. Obama's view of his own importance and authority.

&gt;There is a rich vein to mine here for GOP nominee Mitt Romney. Americans have a sober respect for a balance of power, so much so that they elected a Republican House in 2010 to stop the Obama agenda. The president's response? Go around Congress and disregard the constitutional rule of law. What makes this executive overreach doubly unsavory is that it's often pure political payoff to special interests or voter groups.",,False,,t5_2tk0i,False,,,True,t3_w5ghl,http://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/w5ghl/wall_street_journal_op_obamas_imperial_presidency/,

(On a related note, let’s say its 50-50 in the senate this November – would the VP act as a tiebreaker for a justice confirmation?)

Thomas seems to be the most polarizing judge and was elected 52-48. I just don’t think that it is fair for a justice to be elected for life based on a simple majority. However, Justice Scalia was elected 98-0 and seems to be nearly as polarizing as Thomas – how did this happen? It was a little before my time.

How does this sound: have 9 sitting Justices with one non-voting reserve justice. This non-voting justice will have to be elected by 2/3 of the senate, and will only have voting power during a 4-4 decision (if a judge recuses or something). When a sitting justice dies/retires, the reserve becomes a sitting justice. This would also prevent a new judge from being elected Chief (the most senior justice would become Chief). However, I’m not sure what you would do in the situation of two judges leaving at the same time.

* The working class thrive the most when the operate as a collective. ([Here's the wikipedia article on collective bargaining](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_bargaining), in case you're unfamiliar)

I'd almost argue that the upper and lower class trade in different currencies: the upper class possess money which they trade for labor while the lower class possess labor, which they trade for money.

Anyway, the issue at hand is that Thatcher said (I'm simplifying a lot) that everyone should act as individuals and not depend on society or collectivism. Some people seem to think this is spot on. Some people feel that this is asking the working class to play by a set of rules meant to keep them from moving up in society.

I didn't come up with anything I hadn't read before, but I came up with a question, mainly about the US system.

There's a well-circulated assertion that ""People who do not pay taxes should not be allowed to vote"". One path of reasoning that can land here is viewing the government as a fiscal co-operative, where people purchase shares and then get voting privileges based on their investment in the whole. One weakness of this thinking is that routinely, up to just short of 50% of shareholding opinion will be overruled, but the assertion and its reasoning (and even the truth of this weakness) can all wiggle a bit to accommodate.

Let's alter the seminal assertion a bit. Consider ""People should have representation in government proportional to their interest"". Now, if you replace ""people"" by ""constituents"", interpret ""interest"" to be ""population"" and apply this to a large national or federal government (eg, Brazil, Russia, USA, the EU), you get a common idea that floats around, at least around the time when those large vote-governed bodies are being formed: ""Constituents should have power in government proportional to their population."" It wouldn't be surprising that founders would try to define constituents of roughly equal populations; that would greatly simplify representative voting. I interpret the commonness of this idea, whether or not it is effected, to be evidence that the people who found governments see value in humans, somewhat comparably to the way fiscal collectives view money.

In a system of proportional democratic representation, an ideology that commands a great majority of voters will find its conclusions well-enacted. In a system of proportional fiscal representation, a party that commands a great majority of shares will find its will well-enacted. Both of these systems seem like coercible and inevitable equilibria, but they can also be at odds. Take a look at a US [taxpayer breakdown](http://www.ritholtz.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/MINT-TAXES-R2.png). If we use taxes to measure fiscal investment, that diagram suggests that 5% of the population has a 60% fiscal investment in the US government, and 47% of the population supports 0%. A fair-say-for-your-investment model would likely, in that case, be viewed as utterly draconian.

Were this a collection of 20 people, and were I that one person who saw myself as doing most of the work, I wouldn't take that lying. I wouldn't start a revolution, but I would devise a scheme to get my fair input back.

Note that in real life we end up with lobbyists and and campaign financing and healthcare laws (and healthcare reform) that all support the major players in these industries. Unsurprising. I am not interested in whether this is moral or not. I am interested in whether it is the inevitable negative feedback against a democratic system that promises inequitable returns from fiscal investment, whether it would be more efficient to just openly let tax shareholders numerically stack against each other, and whether it would be wise to cleave social and fiscal legislation apart.

(It is in the obvious interest of the invested to prevent the poor from being *too* poor.)

What do you think, both of this reasoning and of what can/could be done about this subject?

(Edit - A particular dramatic implicit oddity of this submission is the equation of income taxes with government revenue. Incorporating it would make the case much stronger, but much more complicated, so it wasn't necessary for a schematic discussion.)",,False,,t5_2tk0i,1345068007.0,,,True,t3_y9g5h,http://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/y9g5h/who_gets_the_most_out_of_their_government/,

My definition of Government Bailout: ""Money paid by a government to a private entity in order to prevent its imminent failure which would cause serious and lasting damage.""

Going off these definitions it seems a bailout is a subset of subsidies. Yet when people talk about bailouts many people find them totally objectionable although no one is that bothered by the billions in subsidies the US spends yearly.

While staunch laissez-faire capitalists may believe the government has no role to play in this sphere, and dedicated communists may believe that full central control is key, there's a whole range of options in between that promote various levels of government involvement.

I recently read some articles about US government policies — well-intentioned when they were enacted — that have resulted in bizarre problems. First, there's apparently pent-up American demand for light pickup trucks, especially with diesel engines. They're quite popular in the rest of the world, but the combined policies of [strange CAFE rules](http://www.thetruthaboutcars.com/2012/10/how-cafe-killed-compact-trucks-and-station-wagons/) and the [""Chicken tax""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken_tax) have basically killed the whole class of vehicles. And then there's this arcane [raisin confiscation act](http://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2013/04/economist-explains-why-america-regulate-trade-raisins) that has forced farmers to surrender up to 47% of their crops for *zero* compensation. These examples seem to indicate that government intervention can easily lead to unintended negative consequences.

But on the other side of it, [this opinion piece](http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/economic-intelligence/2012/04/19/government-economic-intervention-made-america-great) lists a whole bunch of historical examples where government intervention in specific markets has resulted in significant benefits for the US economy and population as a whole.

In Asia, government initiatives geared towards export markets are largely cited as the driving force behind the rapid and sustained growth of the so-called ""Tiger"" economies.

Governments the world over frequently intervene in the ""market"" for scientific research by funding ventures that would be beyond the scope, means or interest of for-profit companies. Generally speaking, this has been of great benefit to society.

Electricity generation is another example of a sector where market forces don't always work toward the greater good. For example, building a power plant in a remote area might take too long to yield a decent enough return on investment that private companies would take an interest. But when the government builds something like Hoover Dam, a large portion of the population benefits.

I could go on and on for both sides of this argument. It's pretty easy to find examples of both good and bad intervention. What's not easy is to figure out how to make that determination in advance. I have some ideas, but I'd like to know what you think. What criteria should we use to determine when government should and shouldn't intervene in specific markets?

Politifact has outlined [119 promises](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/rulings/promise-broken/) that Barack Obama made on his campaign trail (mostly in speeches) that he has yet to follow through with in office. These promises range from Guantanamo to tax loopholes to transparency to civil rights. I understand that there is [no legal binding](http://www.rbs2.com/elecprom.pdf) holding Obama to these promises, but my question is: should there be? If not legally, an electorate and a press that holds the president accountable for all the he hasn't done?


This is an issue of significant importance. A democracy works by measuring the will of the people through voting. Without an efficient way of translating the opinions of the majority into politics, the public is essentially cut off from the political process.  The electorate decides who they vote for in large part to the plans of the politician for what he or she will accomplish while in office. If they vote for a candidate, they vote for everything that candidate believes in and every promise he or she has made. The problem lies in the fact that voters decide who to choose based on campaign promises. If a candidate does not follow through with the promises they make on the campaign trail, they are directly disobeying the will of the people. 


Let me give an example, if you will, of what I mean. John Smith runs on a platform of tax cuts. He repeats over and over in his speeches and his commercials that he will slash taxes as soon as he gets into office. He is elected because of his promises. Once in office, he does not cut taxes. Unless John Smith works tirelessly and pulls out all the stops to pass legislation, which he doesn’t because he wants to be reelected, if he fails he has failed the people who voted for him and the democratic system. 


There are a couple arguments I would like to address before anyone jumps to disagree. First off is the excuse that an official didn’t “realize” that there would be opposition once he or she got into office. The simple answer is that there is no way for a smart politician who has made it far in politics (I am using Obama as a reference) could possibly overlook the adversarial two-party system while planning his or her future policies. If one actually believed that a politician had no idea what politics in America is then one must find him or her entirely inadequate to run our country. If a politician does not believe that he or she will be able to achieve his or her goals then they should not have made promises in the first place. 


The second argument is the “he tried his best” rebuttal. No, he did not. It has become the trend for politicians to shy away from taking strong stances on anything for one reason and one reason only: reelection. While not an entirely bad motivation, if it impedes on the following through to the best of his or her ability the promises he or she has made in the campaign, then the constant pressure of reelection hinders the democratic process. For example, for the first two years of his presidency Barack Obama had a majority in both the house and the senate and the American people on his side screaming for change. And what did he accomplish? Next to nothing of substance. He didn’t try his hardest because he was hesitant to follow through with the promises he made to the American people because he did not want to jeopardize his political future. 


The third and final argument is that every politician who has ever lived has lied on the campaign trail, and holding specific politicians accountable would be hypocritical. Surely one could make the case that every single president has left out a big chunk of promises while president. However, this does not make it acceptable. Just because there is a history of unaccountability does not somehow make it less dangerous. Did Nicholas II of Russia have the right to oppress his people because every other Czar up to that point had? No, and pardoning current politicians because of the equally unjust acts of those before them is just as absurd. 


I understand that this is a bold assertion to make, and that Washington is way too complicated a place for generalizations. But as of now, all I can see is unresponsiveness from Washington and a largely uninformed and unrepresented populace. If anyone has made it through the block of text this far, what are your thoughts? Do we need a way to hold politicians accountable? 


Tldnr: Politicians can say whatever they want whenever they want and get elected. The fact that they are not held accountable for what they say effectively ruins democracy.

The rough argument goes like this:


1) US infrastructure is in bad shape relative to other 1st-world countries

2) Money is incredibly cheap, so much so that gov't borrowing ends up with negative interest rates in real dollars (b/c interest rates are lower than inflation)

3) Unemployment is particularly high and demand low in construction, leading to low costs for their clients

4) Overall unemployment is a drag on our economy and a significant factor in current budgeting issues


So... Borrow cheap money to make necessary updates to infrastructure at below normal prices. In the process take a bite out of unemployment and help the economy out of its slump.

Any solid arguments against? All I can think of is that this is additional borrowing, which isn't real popular right now. But it seems like this is borrowing for fixed costs, we have to repair roads/bridges/etc at some point, why not when it's cheap?

Now, support for the Electoral College has largely come from ""red"" states, with the prevailing feeling that a popular vote would favor the left, as evidenced in 2000.

So, could a result that's the reverse of the 2000 election, a Republican winning the national vote but losing the Presidency, be the impetus for many on the right to favor switching to a popular vote system? Obviously, many who support the Electoral College system (which [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_electoral_college) does a pretty good job outlining) such as small states or current swing states would oppose a change no matter what, but it's not impossible to think that seeing their guy lose because their base was too concentrated in certain states could cause conservatives to have a change of heart.

1338964116.0,12,self.NeutralPolitics,unkj2,(xpost from r/Politics) I suspect that political violence could go from unthinkable to on the table for some factions within the next four to five election cycles.,16,4,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/unkj2/xpost_from_rpolitics_i_suspect_that_political/,"TLDR (for those who don't want to read the whole thing): IF current political trends in American politics continue as they have been THEN violence by political groups that would have never considered violence before will be an option more likely to be considered. Now for the long explanation:

**First Assumption:** Violence is generally only viewed as a viable option by a significant portion of the population whenever they feel that peaceful options with a legitimate chance of success have been exhausted. I feel that this isn't a stretch in the least. I think that is what's brilliant about the design of our country, it was built for the purpose of allowing any group with enough numbers and passion to have an effect on our political, social, and economic system in some fashion. The sheer number of safety valves has, in the past, prevented the eruption of most forms of serious political violence barring events like the civil war, which was sparked by a question that had no real established means of resolution within the system.

**Second Assumption:** Mainstream political groups are largely disconnected from at least a plurality of the American population. I don't feel that this is that much of a stretch either: if at least 40% of the population doesn't care for either party or only affiliates with one of the two major parties simply due to lack of better options and has serious reservations about it, then we have our plurality. I don't think I'm really grasping here.

**Third Assumption:** Mainstream politics have been growing more polarized, and are likely to continue to trend in that direction. The right has moved further right, the left has moved further left, and the people running the show are more extreme in their views than others have been. With PACs running smear campaigns and the politics of the Wars on Terror and certain social issues still unresolved, things aren't likely to get any less polarized anytime soon.

**Fourth Assumption:** Today sees unprecedented manipulation and monopolization of the available political resources in our system by the major establishments. I personally feel that voter fraud, voter suppression campaigns, gerrymandering, corporate and church involvement, PACs, and coordination via social media have all seen an upward surge in recent years, and I don't think that I am the only one. Previously while in certain elections (local, midterm etc) loose cannons and people unaffiliated with major parties had a chance, today's political setups are sophisticated to a degree to push their agendas on anyone but the other major party, leaving moderates and independents out in the cold.

**Conclusion:** These trends, if they continue and hold true, mean that a large portion of the country will be left feeling increasingly disenfranchised as power trickles into the hands of more radical political factions. With the monopolization of normal avenues of change by these increasingly non-representative groups, political violence will become a serious risk in the US if these trends are left uninterrupted.

I've seen this discussed a few times on Reddit recently but have one main question - why isn't this already being done? 

I would think cable companies would realize not everyone wants a bundled service and would offer a la carte anyways, and let the demand and pricing work itself out from there. 

Was there a law or FCC regulation passed at one point that incentivized them to offer bundles instead? Is it simply because they could offer bundles and charge more prior to the internet and therefore had no reason to offer less prices? 

EDIT: forgot to add - according to [this](http://www.fcc.gov/guides/choosing-cable-channels) explanation from the FCC - cable companies are required to offer a minimum set of channels - and ""Cable television operators **are not required** to offer channels on an à la carte or individual basis. However, cable operators are free to offer channels other than those required to be on the basic tier on an à la carte basis. For example, premium movie services are often offered on an individual basis rather than as part of a package.""

Which seems to me that they can do so, but probably never bother with it because it would mean they can't sell as much. Most cable companies probably would rather charge more for more channels with relatively less PER channel, than charge more for a smaller option. This allows them to keep channels alive that probably wouldn't survive on their own, and thus increase the size of their ""available"" channels. It sounds much niftier to offer 100 channels than 20, even if everyone knows most of the 100 will never be watched by the average Joe.

“Cable operators, as well as other entities that offer video programming services to subscribers (such as satellite television providers), continue to have broad discretion to determine if services are offered on a per-channel or pay-per-view basis, and on how programming will be packaged and marketed to consumers.""

So, since they aren't required to offer a la carte, it seems their main incentives are to bundle - and prior to the advent of competition from streaming sources on the internet, there was no reason to do otherwise.

 The questions is what to do when topics are posted that link to flawed or dubious sources. This includes things like think tanks, blogs, and publications with an established slant. 
 
 The first policy we can have is self-regulation- just downvote sources you don't think belong here. The other is something akin to standards, or a blacklist, or generally the idea that mods can step in if they find it prudent.

* **Sidebar rules**- we have the big three, should we have more? Also [our FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/pteu5/meta_rneutralpolitics_frequently_asked_questions/) dates from February and may be outdated.

* **A frequent threads wiki page**- I get a lot of inspiration from /r/AskHistorians, and one way they've dealt with topics that come up frequently is to have a wiki page, linked on the sidebar, that lists prior threads.

If we define a political move as an action whose objective is to increase political benefits for a party or individual, then it follows that in a democracy we want politicians to make political moves.

Let us imagine that the population overwhelmingly supports some issue. A leader, hoping to get reelected, supports this issue. The leader might not personally agree, may feel ambivalent or apathetic, but chooses to pursue the issue in hopes of getting reelected. This is democracy in action. 

An alternative would be a leader who does not care what would benefit their reelection and does whatever they want. After all, the people chose them, and in doing so enjoys a tacit approval of every action they take. In this view the leader's chances of reelection would be theoretically less than the ""panderer"" *unless* the people value personal integrity and lack of regard for political consequences as a positive. 

Generally speaking, the panderer is preferable to the rogue because in seeking their own self-interest (reelection) they satisfy the self-interest of the people. The people steer the panderer on the one hand, while those same people can only watch as the rogue enacts their personal vision.

Generally speaking, the first past the post system where the candidate with the most votes wins everything (i.e. within a region or nation-state, getting the most votes is the sole way to attain a seat in some sort of institution) is more stable than systems such as proportional representation. An example is the United Kingdom versus much of continental Europe, and Israel.

However, there is an argument that first past the post is not [very representative](http://www.southsearepublic.org/article/2811/read/pros_and_cons_of_the_westminster_or_parliamentary_system).

Also, ""the media"" isn't a very specific phrase I know. Here I'm talking about the media who deliver us news and current affairs.

So with that out of the way, let's talk.

It's clear that many if not most media sources are biased to some degree in one way or another. Many also twist their telling of the news in order to promote sensationalism to increase sales/viewers. However it's also clear the media has an immense power to manipulate and influence the way their audiences think. This is what has me worried.

As my faith in humanity shrank I began to think that the general population is far more susceptible to manipulation than most would like to think. And having such a power, it's not good having the media in the hands of a group of self interested enterprises.

Now of course on the contrary having the media under direct state control can be just as if not more disastrous.

So what I want to discuss is whether the current American/Western media model is right, and what alternatives there are. Is there a model that balances the need to stop this power being abused by private interests and the need to stop it being abused by government interests?

In every instance this was for the civilian populace in the individual country, stability in the region, world safety, and many other reasons. I can see many way's that they differ.

For each situation;

Was action justifiable? Did action need to be taken? Were the goals clearly defined? Were the actions taken legal? Congress never declared war, but did authorize ""use of force"" in some cases, and did not in others. Was that application of the definition of the actions consistent throughout?

What responsibility did the US and it's allies have to help in the reconstruction of those countries after they had removed the existing government?

Opponents of so-called ""drone warfare"" claim it is a special case, unlike other forms of warfare, for several reasons--

1. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) commonly strike across borders, outside of the legal theater of war. In several famous cases the US has bombed targets in Pakistan. It follows, then, that the US has illegally expanded its counterterrorism operations (read: war) into sovereign nations.

Rebuttal: This is not an issue with UAVs in and of themselves, but with the Global War on Terror.

2. ""Drones"" reduce one side's human costs associated with war. This brings a moral hazard, because a nation with drones can attack more things without a corresponding loss of lives. More drones mean more lopsided wars.

Rebuttal: The same is true of every military technology ever. Archery can reduce one side's human costs associated with infantry warfare; so can body armor, mechanized artillery, and even modern medicine. Therefore drones are not the problem per se, simply a necessary evolution according to the escalating nature of military technology.

3. Drones de-humanize both sides. UAV pilots may not feel an adequate moral reservation about attacking targets, or they may experience a great degree of stress by integrating their domestic life with military duties. Inversely, the victims of UAV strikes may perceive the side with UAVs as monstrous and inhuman.

Rebuttal: This begs many questions: what is an adequate level of moral reservation, or what is the self-reported perception of UAVs by their victims? Infantry attacks may cause more monstrous perceptions of one side: the opposite may be true. And either way, war may be intrinsically dehumanizing, to the extent that UAVs are a non-issue.

4. Domestically-operated drones may legitimize more domestic attacks. Drones are so well protected in the theater of war that the only effective counter-attack may target the drone command centers or supply chains.

Rebuttal: Domestic attacks have long preceded ""drone warfare,"" whether to occupy territory or to ""continue politics by any other means"". And drones may be the most effective available way of preventing domestic attacks for a nation like the US.

5. Most nations require the consent of the people, exercised through the legislature, to conscript or enlist citizens: drones can function exclusively under the authority of an executive or a military complex, not a legislature. Therefore drones are further removed from democratic oversight.

Putting aside the lack of access to the internet, let alone, a computer, and muddy politics, how realistic would it be to replace our current tax system with an open-source, tax money allocating system with an analytics platform?

My idea was that it would allow people to fund programs and agencies directly, money and lobbying would go away from the government (special interests would have to gain the support of the people), and it would enable us to measure the efficiency and the impact a program/agency has on the country (or state) as a whole. Maybe put some regulations in place that anything under a certain % of efficiency/impact over a period of time are automatically dissolved? I'm probably simplifying it too much, but this was the concept.

This would essentially promote transparency, accountability, flexibility, and requiring people to research.

'Pork' is a term mostly used to describe the federal money that elected officials secure for their district or state. Since money for a district generally creates jobs and makes the district a better place to live, an argument that is made often is that elected officials secure their reelection through this money. Sometimes there have been egregious cases where money is used on a district when they have little practical use for it, and other places and programs need funds more seriously.

Some countries besides the United States probably has this problem, it depends heavily on the political system in place.

There are several perspectives on the process- hopefully we'll hear some of them in this thread. Some people say that the whole point of elected officials is to improve their district- thus pork is okay. Some say it's part of a broken political system. Often in political campaigns (legislative or presidential) where one candidate is a long serving congressman or senator, the opponent(s) will decry their actions as part of 'pork barrel politics'.

1338964808.0,10,self.NeutralPolitics,unkxk,Public Sector Unions,10,0,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/unkxk/public_sector_unions/,"A lot of people on r/politics seem to be upset about Walker's victory and support public sector unions. Personally, I'm not so hot on public sector unions. Since this subforum has solid discussion, can anyone try to change my mind on this?


My perspective: 

Politicians can and do give unions concessions without paying for them. Politicians suffer greatly from a strike or the loss of support from a powerful voting bloc, but lose little from granting concessions such as tenure,  work rules, and generous pension and health benefits. The costs of these measures have a large impact on tax payers and the budgets of future politicians, but little impact on the politician that agrees to the contract. Private sector managers have stronger motivations to keep current and future profits high.

Further, public sector unions are not disciplined by competition. If union work or promotion rules make a government branch wasteful and inefficient the union loses little. Inefficiency in the private sector could force the company out of business, but with governments it just means the taxpayers receive worse service at a higher cost.

Public sector unions do offer some benefits above those offered by their private sector brethren. For example, they likely help prevent the politicization of hiring and firing. In addition, they have all of the benefits that private sector unions have (but also the costs.)

However, I think that on balance the costs of public sector unions are larger than the benefits and that they are currently too powerful.

(I think that forcing state and local governments to pay pension/health benefits as they are accrued would also help greatly. Unfortunately, such a change is not politically feasible.)",,False,,t5_2tk0i,False,,,True,t3_unkxk,http://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/unkxk/public_sector_unions/,

Here is an idea I've had: What if the government (read *the people*) owned all markets where a super-majority (let's say 3/5s) of the people use it, and competition is not necessary for advancement of technology. 

Examples would be the water industry, power/electricity (using all methods: hydro, nuclear, solar, fossil fuel), internet/phone service, etc. This would prevent unnecessary markup just to make a profit. People could buy these products from the government at whatever it costs to produce it (labor, equipment, etc.) and nothing more. Maybe an exception could be in times of war or great economic depression, a small tax could be added per unit to generate revenue.
