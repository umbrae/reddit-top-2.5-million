[Ultimate Spoilers],1434,230,957,http://www.reddit.com/r/Bioshock/comments/1b4fmx/my_detailed_ending_explanation_my_attempt_at_the/,"1. A young Booker participates in the massacre at Wounded Knee and is tramautized by the experience.

2. Booker considers baptism as a means of escaping his sin. In one universe (b) Booker refuses, believing that a baptism cannot erase sin. In another universe (c) Booker accepts the baptism and is ""born again"" as Comstock.
The crucial split occurs here. Comstock and Booker both reflect on their actions at Wounded Knee (though nobody remembers Comstock being there since he assumed a new identity, Comstock reflects on his time at Wounded Knee in one of his voice records). Events occuring in each universe will be designated as (b) or (c).

3b. Without Christianity to ""absolve"" him, Booker continues down a ""morally bankrupt"" path. He works as a Pinkerton thug and private investigator. He resorts to gambling and drinking as a means to escape his past.

4b. Despite his ugly state, Booker still finds a wife. Perhaps his wife was a positive force in his life. Either way, his wife dies giving birth to their daughter Anna. His wife's death drives him into a cycle of depression, drinking, and gambling. The debt piles up quickly and the collectors demand payment. Booker is unable to pay and likely to be killed.

5b. Only one man is willing to settle Booker's debt.  It is the male Lutece. He seeks an opportunity to join the female version of himself in Columbia and assisting Comstock in obtaining a genetic daughter (to fulfill the prophecy) appears to be the only way to do so. He conspires with his quantum ""twin"" and Comstock to obtain Booker's daughter, using Comstock's vast wealth to settle the debt and using Lutece's desire to be united in order to motivate them. 

6b. ""Bring us the girl and wipe away the debt."" In a moment of weakness, Booker gives in and sells his daughter. He quickly regrets this act and attempts to retrieve her.  He fails as Comstock makes his way back to Columbia with his daughter. However his interference results in Anna's pinky being severed as the Lutece rift closes. This ""splits"" Anna between two universes and appears to be the cause of her powers.

7b. Booker carves his daughter's initials into his hand as penance for his latest sin. He spends many years riddled by guilt, hidden away in his office. Eventually a new rift opens by the Lutece's and Booker steps through into Comstock's universe at the beginning of the game. 

~~~

3c. As a born-again Christian, the renamed Comstock sets about creating a city in the sky. He enlists the aid of a female physicist named Lutece to accomplish this endeavor. He quickly gains much attention and followers through his endeavors. 

4c. Columbia is created and Comstock leads Columbia as American's ""finest city"". However, Columbia intervenes in the Boxer Rebellion and kills countless Chinese. The U.S. government attempts to ""recall"" the city and Comstock responds by declaring secession from the USA. 

5c. Now in a heated tension with the US, Comstock believes that the US has strayed from its path/mission and become a place of great sin. Comstock receives a prophecy that it is his ""seed"" that will essentially bring about the next apocalypse by raining fire on the land below and having Columbia serve as the next ""ark"". 

6c. Lutece has been using  her quantum discoveries to open keep the city afloat and to open rifts to other universes. These experiments have rendered Comstock sterile and he is unable to conceive the ""prophecy child"" with Lady Comstock. He turns to Lutece to find a solution. Female Lutece has been opening rifts and believes she has a solution. Perhaps as a form of ""wish fulfillment"", she opens a rift into Booker's universe and makes contact with a version of herself - a male Lutece. She wishes for her ""brother"" to join her and a solution is reached for all parties where male Lutece will retrieve a genetic child for Comstock and come to Columbia. 

7c. Comstock and male Lutece bring Anna to Columbia. Lady Comstock suspects adultery. Comstock declares this a ""miracle"" child that was conceived in just one week and christen the child ""Elizabeth"". Comstock has his wife and the Lutece's killed at some later point in order to secure the secret of his child. Anna is gifted with tremendous power and sealed away until she can be bent to her father's will. 

8c. Nealy 20 years pass. The Lutece ""twins"", not truly dead, have a disagreement. Perhaps feeling guilt for his role in abducting a child to another universe, or fearing for the future that will occur as a result of Elizabeth remaining in Comstock's custody (burning of New York, presumed end of the world), or maybe simply recognizing that Elizabeth's rifts are the universe's way of expressing that Elizabeth doesn't belong in this universe (due to the severed finger remaining in Booker's universe) - the male Lutece has demanded that Elizabeth be returned home. 

9c. Elizabeth is sealed away however and her powers are siphoned. The ""twins"" decide that the only way to bring Elizabeth home is to close the ""infinite loop"" that has been created by Comstock taking Booker's daughter. Only Elizabeth has the power to reach the place where the loop was created and Booker will ultimately be needed for the closure. So, they create a rift back into Booker's universe (Columbia doesn't even exist there, which is why he's never heard of it) and bring him into Comstock's universe. This shift into a universe with ""himself"" disrupts his memories, and new ones are created to make sense of the world and his new mission. Booker draws on the traumatic memory of losing his daughter to create these new memories whereby the Pinkertons have tasked him to return Elizabeth to New York. ""Bring us the girl and wipe away the debt.""

10c. Booker comes to Columbia and ultimately rescues Elizabeth from her fate as the ""next Comstock"" that will bring about the end of the world. However, Elizabeth will never truly escape her fate as long as the ""infinite"" loops exists with infinite variations of her, Comstock, the city, and Songbird. The only way to close the loop is to stop the Booker/Comstock divergence from occurring. Elizabeth figures this out and some of her ""infinite"" copies join her to emphasize the problem and they join to drown Booker during the baptism to ensure that the infinite loop is closed. 

11b/c. Booker dies in the water at his baptism. Therefore he never has a child and Comstock never rises. The infinite cities all cease to exist. The post-credit scene implies that with the infinite loop closed, Booker is returned back to life as it was right before the loop was created - with baby Anna sitting in his side office. While you do not see her, Booker existing without Anna would require the existence of Comstock to take her, something that clearly cannot happen now. The best explanation for this scene is that up until the baptism all the Comstock and Booker universes always existed and were completely identical until the relevant choice that defines them. This fits were the ""always existing"" theme of alternate universes that allows us to explore the alternate realities of Chen Lin and is reinforced by comments from the Luteces. This speculative theory suggests that Booker was killed in the universe where he accepts the baptism (which in turn hosts an infinite number of other universes following that city, all with the theme of one man-one city-girl-song bord) and thus by closing that universe, all Comstocks cease to exist. The ""non baptism"" universe and all its derivatives remain intact and hence we see Booker back in his office after the credits. Now there can be no interference from the ""Comstock universes"" and thus at least in one universe he will be with his daughter. 


Remaining big questions:

1- The prophecy was actually correct. Comstock said it was delivered by an archangel. What really happened? Who actually tipped off Comstock that someone with ""AD"" on their hand would be coming to retrieve Elizabeth? The only possibility is that female Lutece never wanted to leave her twin (they would be seperated for eternity if the loop was closed) and therefore she arranged for ""visions"" and ""prophecies"" to appear for Comstock in order to ensure that their universe remain intact and uninterupted - no matter how bad it got for anyone else. Since her brother wanted the loop closed, its quite possible that she had to work ""behind the scenes"" in the form of angels/prophecies to try and ensure that Booker failed and the loop remain open. Or perhaps Comstock was simply gifted these revealing visions of the future through random rifts that appeared. Perhaps as part of ""wish fulfillment"" these open rifts gave Comstock visions of the future and people like Fink secrets of the plasmids/big daddies. 

2- The Bioshock link. The story makes it clear that Bioshock/Rapture/Ryan/Little Sisters/Big Daddies were just another ""infinite variable"" of Columbia/Comstock/Elizabeth/Song Bird. This is troubling since it implies that the entire Bioshock story was just another derivative of the current story, and it also implies that that entire Bioshock universe ceases to exist once the infinite loop is closed. It's also very puzzling to figure out how a man inspired to create a city through scripture, would end up being related to the ""godless industralist"" that was Ryan. 

Edit: Made a few slight changes and expanded on #11 to explain the ending. I'm also adding this tantalizing tidbit from Bioshock indicating that Andrew Ryan is related to Comstock in a universe that plays out with different ""variables"":

*Throughout BioShock, the bathyspheres are used by Jack as a mode of transportation to travel around Rapture and its ""abandoned"" city sections. It is revealed that Jack can use the bathyspheres only because his genetic signature is close enough to Ryan's that the security system doesn't deny him access. Sullivan clearly states this in one of his Audio Diaries ""Sisters, cousins — anyone in the ballpark genetically will be able to come and go as they see fit.""* --- Booker is able to use the bathysphere to reach the surface. This occurs after the civil war when genetic restrictions on Bathysphere travel were put in place to stop rebels/dissidents from escaping.

**Ending**

    The following points are simply my thoughts on the ending. If other people have alternate explanations,
    please post them and I will link to them here.

**What are Constants and Variables?**

    ""Happen, happened, will happen.""
        Robert Lutece

This is honestly a hard thing to describe as we are not privy to the entire set of time/dimension traveling rules in this game. However, we can get some snippets of what is certain from the events in the game.

The Lutece twins speak of constants and variables. In short, this means that in every timeline, there are certain decisions at are always made, or certain events will always play out in a certain way. They experimented this with the [coin toss experiment](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTAXzCByaVs), where Booker will always flip the coin heads, as he has done 122 times previously. They also demonstrated the inevitability of certain events. In the beginning of the game, [Booker receives a telegram to not choose #77](http://youtu.be/t33NMoZeXO4?t=1m40s). However, during the raffle, Booker will always pick #77, which will set off a series of events that tag Booker as the False Shepard and enemy of Columbia.

So, back to the original timeline, we have Comstock, who grows in power and creates Columbia thanks to the efforts of Lutece. However, his repeated experiments with tears has rendered him infertile and caused other debilitating side effects. Thus, Comstock planned to steal Anna, Booker DeWitt's daughter from the other world, in order to continue his dream to create the Lamb. However, once this occurs, the Lutece twins, in one of their tear experiments, see a future in which Elizabeth rains fire and brimstone on the world. Before they could do anything about it, however, their machine was sabotaged by Fink and they were caught in the blast. But instead of dying, they seemed to have been [scattered across the possibility space](http://bioshock.wikia.com/wiki/A_Theory_On_Our_%22Death%22). However, in this state, they do not risk tampering with the timelines. They instead [continued](http://bioshock.wikia.com/wiki/An_Ultimatum) to find the person who would be able to actually save Elizabeth: Booker DeWitt.

Thus, the twins appeared to Booker 20 years after he lost his daughter and brought him over. However, upon crossing his memories changed, prompting curiosity from the Lutece twins. They continued this over and over, observing each Booker that they encounter, noting of certain constants and variables that occur whether or not Booker actually succeeds in saving Elizabeth in that timeline. [One constant they realize is that there will be an infinite number of timelines with Comstock in it, thus Booker will always lose his child in every timeline.](http://bioshock.wikia.com/wiki/What%27s_Done_is_Done) Even if Booker does succeed in one timeline, in another he is unable to stop Comstock. This is the universal Constant, that no matter how many times they repeat this, these series of events ""happen, happened, and will happen"". In order to truly stop Comstock's ambition, they needed to find a Booker that would be able to break this circle of events.

The only way to do that is to find the Booker who would realize the existence of this Constant and end it before it all begins. And, it seems that #123 might be it...

**Why does Booker have to die?**

    ""Booker, are you sure you want to go through with this?""
        Elizabeth

The idea behind the multiverse is the idea that for every decision that is made, an infinite number of universes will come into existence that explores every possible outcome of that decision. In this game, that crucial decision is the point where Booker decides to meet Father Witting to be baptized of his sins in the war. Here, Booker decides to either refuse the baptism, upon which he remains Booker DeWitt, or accepts it, upon which he becomes Zachary Hale Comstock. Now, while it is clear that there are two distinct characters that emerge from this event, what about the Booker right before the choice is made? This Booker can be considered to be simultaneously Booker and Comstock until his decision is made. This idea stems from the principle of the [Shrodinger's Cat thought experiment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger%27s_cat).

Booker, *right at this moment*, is about to make the decision on whether to continue on with the baptism or not. The decision is right before him, and there are two possible outcomes: one in which he refuses the baptism and remains Booker DeWitt, and the other in which he accepts the baptism and becomes Zachary Hale Comstock.

*KILLING THE BOOKER WHO ACCEPTS THE BAPTISM WILL NOT END THE PROBLEM*. As soon as a decision is made, an infinite number of possibility spaces come into exist. The only way to truly stop this space from forming is to kill Booker while the possibility of Comstock exists, but he has not made a decision yet. This is the state in which Booker is simultaneously Booker and Comstock, and [this is where the mutliverse Elizabeths drown him](http://youtu.be/F-VJ3j2bPJk?t=14m41s). This can only be possible when Booker realizes the existence of this loop and accepts his death.

**But the Booker we played was the one that was drowned...right?**

    ""The mind of the subject will desperately struggle to create memories where none exist...""
        Rosalind Lutece

So, throughout the game, we see instances of Booker's memories getting rewritten, as well as some other people. Whenever this happens, it is indicated by dizziness and bleeding from the nose. It's hard to draw a conclusion when only Booker, Chen Lin, and the guards having been affected, but I'll do my best. 

Whenever Elizabeth opens a tear, she is moving to a universe that contains the conditions that she wants or needs at the moment. However, her ability also has a small area of effect, bringing with her people around her in a small radius. We can see this shown when [Fink's Head of Security is unaffected](http://youtu.be/IDx35AtYWUQ?t=29s), despite being dead in the first timeline. Whenever a tear is opened and the people step through, the mind will attempt to settle paradoxes by rewriting memories.

The first paradox we see is the state of being alive or dead, which affects Chen Lin, Booker, Lady Comstock, and two guards. What happens here is that the memories of the dead and the living are in conflict with each other, so the mind will attempt to combine memories of death with life. The effects of this seem to vary in intensity and results. A common ailment is that people will end up feeling traumatized and deeply disoriented, often seen struggling with their deaths. A possibly more intense reaction is the formation of new abilities, although Lady Comstock's situation is a bit special as [1) Elizabeth's powers were forced by the Siphon and 2) the Lady Comstock brought over is the one that encompasses the traits that Elizabeth imagined her to have](http://youtu.be/hB8tUKDbYd8?t=3m32s). 

Booker's situation is a special case as he is actually stepping into another universe. Thus the memories that merge will collect in his mind, which is seen in the case where Booker has memories of leading the Vox revolution. What is interesting is how Booker is unaffected when he's jumping from the first to second timeline in The Good Time Club. My guess is that because Booker is stepping into a timeline where there isn't a Booker. However, because the circumstances would've been the same, the mind does not have to rewrite his memories. *This idea is tenuous at best, and could simply be the result of an oversight by the developers unless someone can explain this better.*

The second paradox is the state of existing or not existing in the timeline, which is what affects Booker and Robert Lutece. Because Booker steps into a timeline where he doesn't exist, Booker's mind is trying its best to rectify that, muddling his memories to fit within this new universe. [Robert Lutece also experiences this as well](http://bioshock.wikia.com/wiki/One_and_the_Same) when he crosses over to meet his sister. This is a type of paradox where the memories of the same people will *not* merge.

Why is it the second paradox people will merge, but not the first type? Well, I can theorize that it has to do with whether or not the memories merging belongs to the same people. The Chen Lin in the first and second universes have the same identity and are practically similar, so their memories will merge. However, Booker, Comstock, Rosalind, and Robert are largely unaffected by the paradox of being in two places at once, with some minor hemorrhaging on the side of Booker and Robert. This may be due to the fact that there is enough of a difference between them that the universe allows them to exist simultaneously. In the case of the Lutece twins, what separates them is [their gender](http://bioshock.wikia.com/wiki/One_and_the_Same), where combining them would probably induce another paradox of being both male and female. For Booker and Comstock, it is mentioned that Comstock's [own identity has been eroded due to repeated exposure to the tears](http://bioshock.wikia.com/wiki/On_the_Entropy_of_Genes), thus making his identity different to that of Booker's.

So, what about Elizabeth? Why is not affected in any way? Again, we have a special case where Elizabeth's power over the tears allow her to retain her identity and memory. We cannot say for sure, as the origin of Elizabeth's powers is simply explained with a hand wave of [being in two places at once](http://bioshock.wikia.com/wiki/The_Source_of_her_Power), and the game doesn't delve deeply into this.

So, what does all of this have to do with the ending? Well, at this point, Elizabeth has the ability to open any tear she wants and can access the infinite doors that lead to different timelines. So, when Booker steps through, he is essentially going back and time, his own self is reverted to that time period's Booker. This can be seen when you accept Preacher Witting's hand for baptism, [Booker's own hand is young and has no AD or bandage wrapping around it](http://youtu.be/F-VJ3j2bPJk?t=7m41s). This signifies that Booker has merged with his younger self, starting again at the baptism scene. This points to the fact that the Booker that we play through and the Booker that is drowned by the Elizabeths are one and the same person.

**What does the scene post-credits mean?**

**Why did they end up in Rapture?**

Elizabeth needed a place to destroy Songbird, and the best place would be deep underwater, where he wouldn't be able to survive under immense pressure. This is seen in many of Fink's blueprints concerning Songbird and Songbird's reaction to water, seen the first time he attacks you when you and Elizabeth crash into Battleship Bay.^[Venndicator](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bioshock/comments/1bk21y/bioshock_infinite_the_ultimate_spoiler_faq/c97fsv9)

Another reason is to tie Columbia and Rapture thematically. Rapture, like Columbia, is very much a dystopia, and the game *Bioshock* holds many similarities with *Bioshock Infinite*. This suggests that Rapture is an alternate dimension of Columbia. This is further exemplified when Elizabeth mentions ""There's always a lighthouse, there's always a city, there's always a man"", pointing to the main thematic similarities between both cities, and the overarching themes of the series and possible future iterations of the series.

An interesting tidbit is that Booker is able to operate the Bathysphere. In *Bioshock*, the only people who are able to operate this device without setting off the alarms are people genetically related to Andrew Ryan, the founder of Rapture. This points to the fact that Booker DeWitt and Andrew Ryan are somehow related in another dimension.

They will get you banned and you will not be unbanned. This rule has been in the sidebar for about a week but every time someone is banned for it, without fail they will argue and complain.

As well as reaction gifs we no longer want memes to be posted unless they are in a self post. We feel like there are a lot of nonquality memes being upvoted that contain no discussion in the comments. Some people are very blatantly using these types of posts as a way to get summa dat sweet sweet karma. **Meme posts that will be accepted in a link post and not a self post are ones in which the main picture comes directly from one of the bioshock games. For example, A picture of Atlas with a scumbag steve hat that reads ""Asks you to save his family, tries to kill you in the process"" (not particularly funny, but I'm trying to outline a point)**

Spoiler tags have always been a rule, and most people abide by it, but remember that not tagging spoilers in nonspoiler threads will get you **BANNED!** And whether or not you get unbanned really depends on the nature of the spoiler (whether you did it unintentionally in discussion or were just being a douche).

**And lastly, as always, if anyone has any artwork/suggestions for the subreddit please feel free to post. Were all open to changes and making things look pretty, but not everyone is a graphic artist!**

1365207416.0,372,self.Bioshock,1brp1m,"HOLY SHIT, Booker. Huge voxophone subplot. [ending spoilers]",414,42,110,http://www.reddit.com/r/Bioshock/comments/1brp1m/holy_shit_booker_huge_voxophone_subplot_ending/,"**Booker DeWitt/Comstock is a self-hating Native American.** Or at least, partly of Native American descent. Ugh. It makes all of the white supremacy/anti-miscegenation in Columbia even creepier. What the fuck, Booker.

**Exhibit A:** Booker speaks Sioux (so we are told by Preston Downs, who took in an injured Native American child in Voxophone 44).

&gt;""Turns out, though— DeWitt speaks Sioux. He helped me swap words with this cripple child I've been uh...looking after. Now after hearing how the kid has fared in your city— I'm thinking, when we take your pelt, I'll let him hold the knife."" —Voxophone 53, Preston Downs

An unusual skill for a white, east coast detective. He *could* have learned it during his time in the army, but, given Exhibit C, it's extremely unlikely.

**Exhibit B**: Booker/Comstock was particularly vicious at Wounded Knee. Not a big deal by itself, but, wait for C.

&gt;""DeWitt...we called him the White Injun of Wounded Knee, for all the grisly trophies he claimed."" —Voxophone 32, Captain Slate

**Exhibit C:** The reason for his viciousness is that Booker was alienated by persistant rumors that he was partially of Native-American descent. As Comstock he would continue to be a racist asshole.

&gt;""In front of all the men, the sergeant looked at me and said, *'Your family tree shelters a teepee or two, doesn't it, son?'* This lie, this calumny, had followed me all my life. From that day, no man truly called me comrade. It was only when I burnt the teepees with the squaws inside, did they take me as one of their own."" —Voxophone 61, Comstock

So, from Booker's early days, there were rumors that he was part Native-American (it ""had followed [him] all [his] life""). Not until after Wounded Knee did the rumors stop.

Plagued by rumors that he was secretly an Indian, rumors that he hated, Booker Dewitt, the young soldier, would never have tried to *learn* Sioux, to become a translator. That would only make the rumors worse. He didn't learn it in the army. 

Booker probably didn't go back to the Midwest to learn the language following the massacre (the Lakota, the victims of the massacre, speak a Sioux dialect); he didn't seem to want to confront that part of his past, and was living in New York, riddled with guilt, addiction and debt.

Plus, he *probably* didn't learn it after having Anna, since his guilt about selling Anna seemed to replace/outweigh his guilt over Wounded Knee, if it even still existed (Comstock was baptized because of guilt over it, but would later celebrate it in the Hall of Heroes...) He didn't learn it in the army. He already spoke it well enough to interpret by the time he got to Columbia. So, he must have known it since he was a child.

What white man learns Sioux as a child, in the 1800s? Booker is almost certainly part Native-American. He might even be Lakota.

So, what the fuck, Comstock, filling your city with white-supremacist/racial purity propaganda and being anti-miscegenation, you and your Lamb are both 'impure.' Fuck you, Booker.",,False,self,t5_2shl2,1365221671.0,,,True,t3_1brp1m,http://www.reddit.com/r/Bioshock/comments/1brp1m/holy_shit_booker_huge_voxophone_subplot_ending/,

I was sitting by the sidelines, when a boy of about fourteen walked up to me and looked at me for a couple of seconds. I noticed he was wearing formal clothing: A orange collared shirt, and khaki pants. This wasn't unusual, though. Afterall, it was Sunday, and there was a large Catholic Church pretty close to the lacrosse fields. I also noticed that he was holding a notebook under his right arm.


Anyway, after a couple of seconds he asked me, ""heads or tails"" while simultaneously handing me a dime. I was somewhat awestruck for a second, and then I flipped the dime. It landed heads up in the boy's hand. He looked at me weird for a second, clicked his tongue, and murmured ""Twenty seventh time in a row..."" and he marked it on his notebook.
After that, he just walked away. I just stood there, confused, thinking I'd been visited by Robert Lutece.


After I got home from the Lacrosse game, I looked in the mirror and noticed that I had been wearing a T-Shirt with a Big Daddy on it. I then realized that I was a victim to either the best troll or the best cosplayer in the world, or both.


TDLR; Visited by young, trolling Robert Lutece.

EDIT: Robert Lutece himself has told me that it wasn't him.

EDIT: Rosalind Lutece has neither confirmed nor denied her brother's doings

EDIT: There was a coin. He wants you to ask him anything.

1364618170.0,335,self.Bioshock,1bacog,"ENDGAME SPOILERS: The ""good"" part about the ending of Bioshock Infinite",376,41,375,http://www.reddit.com/r/Bioshock/comments/1bacog/endgame_spoilers_the_good_part_about_the_ending/,"From what I've read in this sub, it seems everybody is kinda depressed about the ending of Bioshock Infinite. I think I've found the light at the end of the tunnel, however. The ending of Bioshock Infinite is a ""good"" ending, and here's why:

1. We all know about the two main universes: Universe A, where Booker is baptized and becomes Comstock; and Universe B, where Booker refuses baptism and eventually sells his daughter, Anna.

2. Both Comstock and B-Universe Booker are the bad guys. B-Booker, because he sold his daughter, and Comstock because of all the terrible things he did involving Columbia.

3. Lutece (both of them) regret their decision and want to give Booker another chance. When Lutece(s) take B-Booker and transplant him (several times, actually) into Universe A, he ceases to be the Booker in Universe B (as indicated by the memory loss), and is now what I like to call ""C-Booker"".

4. So here's how the ending is a ""good"" ending, and not a ""bad"" one: When the Elizabeth's supposedly drown C-Booker, it is because C-Booker wants to kill Comstock. But to do so, he must also kill B-Booker (which he thinks is himself). He agrees with this. So when they drown Booker, it is not C-Booker that the Elizabeth's/Anna's drown, but Comstock/B-Booker.

5. The C-Booker is the one who chose neither to commit the actions of Comstock or B-Booker. This is why he is able to (presumably) ""return"" to his daughter in the after-credits scene. He has redeemed himself, represented by the re-birth and ""baptism"" given by the Elizabeth's.

_________________________________

This is the result of me racking my brain for the past day, trying to piece everything together. I believe this explanation is sketchy at best, but it makes perfect sense in my head, and allows me to feel good about the ending. It is the only way I can rationalize the existence of the after-credits scene, which, in my mind, is all-important - everything that happened in the game must line up with the fact that Booker is alive at the end of the game, back in his office.

**EDIT:** Here's one reason why I think this is true: the Bioshock 1 connection. The first Bioshock was the story of a man who has been dealt a bad hand. Throughout the game, he was controlled the entire time, to the point where he never really had a choice - until the end. He was able to fight back against Fontaine/Atlas after killing Ryan. Basically he went from not having a choice to having a choice, and acting on it in a way that there is a ""happy"" ending. In Bioshock 1, the happy ending is that the little sisters are rescued by and live with Jack until he dies peacefully. In Bioshock Infinite, the happy ending results from C-Booker choosing to neither be Comstock or the man who sold his daughter (B-Booker), and he drowns them both sacrificially. He is then ""re-born"" through the Elizabeths' baptism, to a point where he is both with his daughter and remembers the events of the game.",,False,self,t5_2shl2,1364668604.0,,,True,t3_1bacog,http://www.reddit.com/r/Bioshock/comments/1bacog/endgame_spoilers_the_good_part_about_the_ending/,

1365358339.0,292,self.Bioshock,1bv3w9,On Violence in Bioshock Infinite (SPOILERS),339,47,98,http://www.reddit.com/r/Bioshock/comments/1bv3w9/on_violence_in_bioshock_infinite_spoilers/,"So I read an article on Kotaku talking about how the crazy graphic violence lessens the impact of the game. I've been thinking about it myself and I wanted to talk about it.

I think in a lot of FPS games you're not supposed to think about the weight behind the act of shooting people. They try to give you justifiable reasons, make you out as the good guy and make them the bad guys, to make it easy to point your gun at people and shoot without thinking too much about it. So either A the violence is trivialized and downplayed (most realistic games) or B the violence finds refuge in audacity and is outright over the top (Team Fortress 2, Left 4 Dead 2, Gears of War). I think the reason people feel uncomfortable with the incredible violence in BI is it's not supposed to be morally easy.

For instance the first cop you kill. Everything up to that point is idyllic (after you enter the city, anyway) and light and bright, but that comes crashing down when Booker shoves that cop's head in that spinning blade and blood gets everywhere. Sure, he was threatened, but he drew first blood, like a natural killer. It symbolizes the fact that Booker is the monster. It's a shocking display of brutality. It forces you to see what a horrible and stark thing violence, and the sight of blood is, in a genre of game where it is so often trivialized. And Booker settles into the flow like it's an old friend, although with some reluctance. Like he tells Elizabeth later when she asks if he ever gets used to the killing, ""Faster than you can imagine"". And I think this is partly a comment on our role as players going into a FPS, just like how Jack's lack of agency is a comment on our role as gamers in an authored experience.

When Elizabeth starts following you around and you're ambushed, it really hit me hard. In the area prior her innocence and lightheartedness is at the forefront, and this puts it in high contrast when you slaughter those cops in front of her. She becomes afraid of you, and the game is really not trying to make you feel comfortable with the killing. We kill so many people in games, but rarely does a game challenge us to really think about what we are doing.

One of the most poignant scenes (MAJOR SPOILER) for me was the death of Comstock. It's the equivalent of Bioshock's Andrew Ryan encounter. That little space looks so idyllic, and lush and beautiful with the font and his sudden change of tone. Then Booker comes along and brings with him the brutality and violence that he brings everywhere. He's a monster. It's the violence we're used to in games, just not made easy to swallow. There is no victory cheer or reward. Just... blood. Murder is murder, and the game never tries to make you feel justified about it.

So in short, I think I'm just saying that I feel the violence is not really out of character for Booker or out of tone with the game, and that it makes sense. Because Booker is the monster, on so many levels, the sinner beyond redemption, the source of all the evils in the game in one way or another. It's just not as simple as being the good guy with a just cause. We're just so used to not having to face what it means to fire guns at people.

Anyway, I hope I'm doing this right.",,False,self,t5_2shl2,False,,,True,t3_1bv3w9,http://www.reddit.com/r/Bioshock/comments/1bv3w9/on_violence_in_bioshock_infinite_spoilers/,

1364626615.0,273,self.Bioshock,1baj47,An open letter to Irrational Games about Bioshock Infinite.,335,62,85,http://www.reddit.com/r/Bioshock/comments/1baj47/an_open_letter_to_irrational_games_about_bioshock/,"Dear Irrational Games,

Thank you. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. I have been playing games for so long, and while I don't consider myself jaded, per se, I have gotten to a point of ennui with games lately. I enjoy them, sure, and multiplayer is a lot of fun - but that's where I get my enjoyment. Storylines don't *mean* anything anymore. They're just tacked on explanation for the multiplayer. I'm not invested in the characters. I don't care whether they live or die, I just care that I blaze through the game so I can understand the setting. 

But this game - **this fucking game.** Oh no. It's not like the others. This one is special. Sure, I heard the hype. I planned on picking it up to play it, because hell, I owe it to myself to play a Bioshock game finally, right? So I spent the $60. I installed the game. I started it up... and was caught off guard immediately. But nothing really amazing - sure it was beautiful and the writing was great, but it's still *just another game.*

Then, I found her. It was an unexpected meeting (for me, the player) and there's something immediately striking about her. Brown hair in a neat ponytail, big blue eyes, delicate features, petite build. Just physically, from the moment you first see her, she catches your eye. And then she looks at you, and she says... ""Are you real?"" Are. You. Real. Just a simple question, but with those three words you get a sense of just how sheltered she's really been - there's a pity that creeps in. You see this girl that has been so sheltered all her life, so much so that when she sees another human, she doesn't greet them, she doesn't do the first-time up-and-down we all do. She stares and asks if they're actually a real person.

And it just goes on from there. The interplay between Booker and Elizabeth makes the game, it really does. The way she helps you, and the comments they make. I waited for the moment when she found more money, so she could flip it to me with a ""Catch!"" and then I could hear Booker's ""Thanks!"" in return.

But to me, the one element that is the core, the very heart and soul of the game... is Elizabeth. She is so integral to the entire game - be it in the story, in gameplay, or in immersing the player - that if she was not absolutely flawless, the game would be just average. But she isn't. She's perfect. Irrational, you've done it. I fell in love with a character. *Finally.* I'm not one to get easily attached, and maybe that's part of the boredom I felt with games. But you did such an amazing job with Elizabeth, that I fell in love with her. The interaction between the player and Liz is so seamlessly put together that you really do genuinely care for her. I fell in love with her fidgets, with the way she explored the world and discovered new things. She pointed out things that I missed and helped me along, and, perhaps most importantly, she showed emotion. She made me feel things I wouldn't have otherwise - I felt regret and even shame for choices that I made, sometimes for things that were out of my control, like plot points. I couldn't change what happened, but I still felt like I had betrayed her. I wanted to rescue her - I wasn't just running from point A to point B trying to get to the next objective, oh no. I was running to rescue Elizabeth, because she needed my help and I was the only one she could rely on. She needed me - but as much as she needed me, I needed her. When she finally changed her appearance, I could feel the pain which caused her to do it. It wasn't just a wardrobe change - you could tell that she was leaving something behind.

In the end, I don't think anything I might say would do this game justice. It's just too good. I try not to let emotion and hype taint my games, but maybe that's my problem. And I think that Bioshock Infinite... it finally broke that wall down. It's as damn close to a perfect game I have ever seen, and maybe will ever see. This game, this story, this... utter masterpiece will go down in history, mark my words.

So thank you, Irrational, for never have I been so invested in a work of fiction - and it's all because of you.

**Edit:** Hey, thanks for the feedback guys. It was late and I was just rambling because I was still shellshocked by the ending. Just goes to show what an amazing game this is, I teared up writing about it. Although I don't think the fact that I was listening to [this song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFxiBP0UFrI) helped with the whole emotion thing.",,False,self,t5_2shl2,1364666136.0,,bronco,True,t3_1baj47,http://www.reddit.com/r/Bioshock/comments/1baj47/an_open_letter_to_irrational_games_about_bioshock/,

Now Robert, full of guilt for taking Anna, loses his interests in science and methodology, while Rosalind, who is apathetic, loses her morality in pursuit of the continuation of science. This makes Robert the moral center, and Rosalind the scientific prowess. They essentially lose part of themselves and need each other to maintain a fully functional and healthy human mind. Without Rosalind, Robert would not have the desire or ability to continue the scientific pursuits. Without Robert, Rosalind would not have the morality to help Booker, and/or keep herself in check as she continues her research. 

This is why Rosalind agrees to help Robert with the Booker situation. In another voxophone Rosalind says that if she does not help Robert, then he will leave her, she knows that this would leave her without a moral center.

To further prove my claims, Robert is shown as the one who initiates the experiment based on morality, while Rosalind claims she against the thought experiment, but continues in order to test the parameters (constants and variables).

Tell me what you think.

1367211340.0,237,self.Bioshock,1dbj12,A bit of irony I noticed on my second Infinite playthrough (SPOILERS),264,27,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/Bioshock/comments/1dbj12/a_bit_of_irony_i_noticed_on_my_second_infinite/,"I started playing through Infinite for the second time recently, and when I got to the raffle scene in the beginning I noticed something. Before the raffle, Booker gets the telegram from the Luteces telling him not to pick number 77. Of course he does end up with that ball, winning the raffle. Because of this, when he goes to throw the ball, everyone sees the AD mark on his hand, they recognize him as the false shepard, and his life becomes exceedingly more difficult from there on out. From the telegram we can assume that Booker picking ball 77 is a constant. It happens in every single universe where he goes to that raffle, and the Luteces have seen it before, time and time again. That's how they know the specific number to warn him against. (On a side note, why would they warn him against picking the ball if they know it's a constant and he's just going to do it anyway? Probably as another kind of experiment, the same way they do the coin flip that comes out the same every single time.)

So where's the irony in this? Well, at the end of the game, we find out that the reason Booker had to sell Anna to Comstock was to pay off his gambling debts. He was an unlucky sap who just couldn't win at games of chance, and he lost everything he had because of it. Now he gets to Columbia, and he's faced with the raffle, a new game of chance that for once he **doesn't** want to win. And of course, he does. Not only does he win in the universe we see, he wins in every single universe where he ever goes to that raffle. The one time he doesn't want to get the lucky number, and it's completely impossible for him to avoid it.",,False,self,t5_2shl2,False,,,True,t3_1dbj12,http://www.reddit.com/r/Bioshock/comments/1dbj12/a_bit_of_irony_i_noticed_on_my_second_infinite/,

1365266206.0,228,self.Bioshock,1bsvok,[SPOILERS] Booker ain't that bad: Some timeline notes,256,28,122,http://www.reddit.com/r/Bioshock/comments/1bsvok/spoilers_booker_aint_that_bad_some_timeline_notes/,"I've noticed it's fairly common for people to come down pretty harshly on Booker for his past actions—and rightly so! He was not a nice dude. I don't think he himself would argue with you. But I wanted to point out some numbers based on the timeline.

This is based largely around the timeline found in the Hall of Heroes. Screenshots [here](http://i.imgur.com/5JtiNTw) and [here](http://i.imgur.com/Vask26B).


1874:

* **Booker is born**. We know the date is accurate and not edited by Comstock because it also appears on Booker's Pinkerton ID that shows up on the loading screens.

1890:

* **Battle of Wounded Knee. Booker is 15/16.** This is certainly not uncommon in this point in history, but it helps explain why Booker didn't exactly respond with grace under pressure. So: you're 16 and you've just become a semi-infamous mass murderer. What are you going to do next?

Somewhere between 1890-1893 (Booker/Comstock are 16-19):

* **Baptism.** Comstock takes the baptism, Booker rejects it. I would argue that rejecting the baptism is the more emotionally mature response, representing Booker's acceptance that what he did was wrong, even given the circumstances. Comstock, on the other hand, wants to be absolved of responsibility—which is pretty in line with a lot of 16-19-year-olds I've known.

* **Comstock meets Rosalind, gets old-looking, learns about alternate realities and how to float a city.** There are kinetoscopes showing Comstock when the city was launched, IIRC. So he's been looking 60+ since he was pre-20. 

* **Booker meets an unknown lady, and gets to watch her die in childbirth.** I don't think it's ever explicitly mentioned that they were married, either. So, you're, say, 17, just back from a war that's left you emotionally scarred. Religion isn't helping. You shack up with a woman, she gets knocked up, gives birth, and dies, and now you're a single dad at 18. 

* **Booker drinks and gambles.** A.k.a. ""The College Years.""

1893 (Booker/Comstock are 19/20):

* **Comstock launches Columbia.** Quite the overachiever. In modern times he'd be on the cover of Times or featured on one of those ""Top 25 Under 25"" lists. Unfortunately he looks like an old man, so people just think he's regular successful.

* **Comstock finds out he's sterile, and gets Rosalind to get her ""brother"" Robert to offer Booker money for his daughter.** Booker, being emotionally wrecked, completely broke, and generally unprepared to raise a child on his own, accepts.

* **Booker tries to back out of the deal, but fails to stop Comstock from stealing Anna/Elizabeth.** She loses her finger, and Booker presumably keeps it in a creepy box in his desk or something, because it remains preserved enough for 20 years to give her powers of mastery over time and space.

Somewhere between 1893-1912 (Booker is 19-38):

* **Booker becomes a Pinkerton, participates in strike-breaking, generally levels up in thuggery. He also brands himself with the initials AD out of guilt.** The Luteces refer to this brand as his ""hair shirt"". 

Meanwhile, 1895 (Comstock is 21):

* **Comstock kills his wife to ensure the secret of Anna/Elizabeth's origin.**

Meanwhile, 1901 (Comstock is 26):

* **Comstock claims responsibility for squashing the Boxer Rebellion in China.** Slate claims Comstock wasn't there at all. Possibly Comstock used news of the rebellion and did some posturing for his own people, giving him an excuse to secede from the USA. 

1909 (Booker/Comstock are 35). (Thanks to rallion for these dates!)

* **Sept 3 1909** The Luteces find out what Elizabeth eventually becomes and does. Robert feels guilty.

* **Oct 16 1909** Robert convinces Rosalind to help undo what they've done. She doesn't see the point, but she will go along with it anyway.

* **Nov 1 1909** The Luteces are ""dead,"" but Robert still intends to fix things.

1912 pre-game (Booker/Comstock are 38):

* **The Luteces enact their plan.** They call up a Booker who has spent 20 years wallowing in guilt over the decision to give up his daughter. Remember, this Booker rejected baptism—he doesn't believe immoral actions can be forgiven so easily. He wants to atone through action instead.

1912-on: 

* **Events of Bioshock: Infinite.**

Maybe it's just me, but some of these numbers make me much more sympathetic towards Booker. He did a lot of dumb, terrible things when he was young and unequipped to deal with them, then spent a long time agonizing over these choices. Ultimately, when he had the opportunity to set things right, he took it.

1365792918.0,218,self.Bioshock,1c81qk,Why Songbird Really Matters (WARNING: SPOILERS),251,33,116,http://www.reddit.com/r/Bioshock/comments/1c81qk/why_songbird_really_matters_warning_spoilers/,"Expanding on a post /u/Appleseed_ made yesterday, Songbird likely has a much bigger role to play than the occasional antagonist in BioShock Infinite. 

Appleseed_ pointed out an interesting symbolic parallel between Booker, Comstock, and Songbird:

&gt; • Comstock: Died because he was drowned by Booker.

&gt; • Booker: Died because he was drowned by Elizabeth(s).

&gt; • Songbird: Died because he was ""drowned"" by Elizabeth.

Thinking more on the suspicion that Songbird might be another iteration of Booker, I realized the following:

&gt; We know Booker is distraught about selling his daughter to Comstock, and we know Comstock foresaw the possibility that Booker would come looking for Elizabeth down the road. It would make sense for Comstock to try conning an alternate version of Booker, one that wants redemption, into joining him in Columbia as his daughter's ward. He'd have to make the sacrifice of becoming the Songbird, but he'd be guaranteed the opportunity to watch her grow up. Extend that a bit further, and there are three other possibilities: 1) Songbird Booker would inherently view protagonist Booker as a threat to his care-taking and redemption, so he'd automatically be inclined to stop protagonist Booker from stealing her away; 2) Comstock is able to sell his warped ideology to Songbird Booker to seal the deal, ensuring his unwavering defense of Elizabeth; or 3) Songbird Booker sees it as his sole responsibility to care for and/or save Elizabeth since he's the one who got her imprisoned in the first place.

There's a description somewhere around Finkton (I can't remember if it's on a chalkboard or a Voxophone) that describes how Fink had a damned hard time getting the bonding between Songbird/Elizabeth to work as effectively as it did for the Big Daddies/Little Sisters. He couldn't force the Songbird to care about Elizabeth unless there was an already-present connection between the two. Assuming Booker's aforementioned guilt after selling Anna (which seems reasonable considering he carved her initials into his hand), it'd be a two-inch putt for Comstock to totally exploit him by making him her guardian. It would also explain why he's so devoted to her, so protective, and so keen on giving her information about the outside world--perhaps knowingly, hoping that she'd eventually ""grow up"" and escape on her own, or unknowingly, thinking that giving her all kinds of books and gifts would make up for what a crappy father he'd been.

During the scene where Fink has Booker 'audition' for head of security, there's discussion about the importance of the job and why Booker is the best qualified--however, there's very little describing what exactly it would entail. Surely, there's no bigger security job in Columbia than taking care of Elizabeth, right? What if one of the ""failed"" Bookers was convinced that Fink's proposal (i.e., to become the head of security/Songbird) was a wise decision? We don't find out what happens in that particular universe because we find Chen Lin dead in the basement, and Elizabeth moves us to an alternate reality where Chen Lin is still alive. Could the reality we left be the one where an earlier protagonist Booker stayed on and became the Songbird?

I can envision DLC or a sequel where we play through as Booker No. 3 or 4 and eventually become the Songbird, taking on its perspective. We get to see protagonist Booker's guilt bubble over and feel compelled to do whatever we can for Elizabeth if it means ensuring her long-term safety. We know that there's no real limit to time or space thanks to the infinite universes, so there's no reason Songbird Booker couldn't have been injected back into the Comstock universe at any point to solidify Comstock's sole rule over Columbia and Elizabeth.

**TL;DR: [Songbird could be an alternate version of Booker convinced to protect Elizabeth from his other selves. Definitely leaves room for an awesome sequel or DLC.](/spoiler)**",,False,self,t5_2shl2,1365793120.0,,robert,True,t3_1c81qk,http://www.reddit.com/r/Bioshock/comments/1c81qk/why_songbird_really_matters_warning_spoilers/,

The Bird represents both freedom, and the jailer (Songbird). In the end, the pendant is just another experiment by the Luteces, and their reaction to Booker's choice suggests that it's a variable.

While the choice bears no consequence on gameplay, it is not without practical use - it marks *your* Elizabeth. From the moment you gift it to her, she always wears the pendant of your choice. Even while burning down New York...

Things get weird in the epilogue, however. While approaching the final Lighthouse with Elizabeth in the boat, she is wearing the *opposite* pendant. Once you disembark onto the pier, her pendant reverts to your choice.

Last but not least, *none of the Elizabeths at the baptism are wearing any pendant at all*. As Booker looks at the Elizabeth in front of him, he notices this as well: ""Who...who are you?"". The Elizabeth that drowns you is not *your* Elizabeth.

**Your Elizabeth does not follow you through the final door to the Baptism.** Perhaps even after all you've done, she does not wish to see you die. This might mean she remains in the Sea of Lighthouses, effectively outside space and time, and thus survives the epilogue.

I believe this is an intentional clue left  for observant players by the developers. I strongly doubt that any of the DLCs will leverage this loose thread, but at least we can comfort ourselves that the game's ending might be a happy one after all (Booker never gets to sell Anna, but our Elizabeth does not get erased from the multiverse either)

1366001212.0,211,self.Bioshock,1cddyu,The Significance of the 123rd Attempt: Theories (Spoilers),247,36,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/Bioshock/comments/1cddyu/the_significance_of_the_123rd_attempt_theories/,"Something that has struck me (among many things) about this wonderful game is just how meticulously crafted every single bit of it is. Like a great movie, no detail or dialogue or element is extraneous. Everything seems packed with meaning, even if that meaning is difficult to unpack.

So it strikes me there hasn't been more speculation on why the 123rd try was ""the one.""

Here's my take. Feel free to expand or destruct in the comments section.

Okay, so first: When Booker enters the lighthouse at the beginning of the game and is faced with the three bells, we are shown a note he has brought along. ""1-2-2, it reads."" Ring the book/scroll bell once; then the key twice; then the sword twice as well. 

(Others have pointed out, though I missed this key detail, that the clock above the dead body also reads 1:22.)

On my first play through, I ran past the lighthouse section, not paying much attention as I itched to get to Columbia. But then I thought about it as I played on 1999 mode. To me, the note demonstrates a worldview (likely Levine's) that has formed the basis of the Bioshock universe:

One Scroll (One Book, or One basis of Knowledge -- in Bioshock Infinite, it could be either the Bible or the Constitution. Or, as I will explain, one's self.)

+

Two Keys (Two ""Answers"" -- i.e., two different interpretations of the same Book or Knowledge -- also can be construed as two leaders promoting those answers.)

EQUALS

Two Swords (War -- the two keys are irreconcilable. The people wielding them will fight to  affirm their ""answer"" or interpretation as the correct one).

We see this with Comstock and Fitzroy, two people who interpret morality and its guiding documents in very, very different manners -- and whose disagreement leads to civil war.

We see this in the original game with Fontaine and Ryan, and on smaller scales throughout both games.

Essentially, IMO, Levine's games are, among other things, condemnations of fundamentalism and radicalism -- both in society and in ourselves. Only by by having a ""third"" force or ""sword"" can we meet somewhere in the middle. Only then can society thrive, and only then can we be comfortable and content as individuals. That sword must take what it learns from both ""keys"" -- both ends of the spectrum -- to fight for and eventually become what is right and rational.

So how does this fit into the 123rd try?

1-2-3. One book. Two keys. Three swords.

Booker is that third ""sword."" 

Booker's quest is a story of a man getting caught in the middle of two radical viewpoints, two different possible universes, both of which are horrible. There is the Comstock universe where he is a racially-cleansing, murderous, scheming ""Prophet."" There is the Booker universe where he sells his own daughter to settle a debt. There are the Founders, with their top-down, oppressive caste system, and the Vox Populi, a fiendish bunch just as violent and horrible.

See where I'm going with this? The only way Booker can succeed -- the only way his story can end 'happily' -- is by fighting to find the middle, a happy medium between two extremes. Yet, Booker is also a victim of his choices: He can shoot and kill as many Founders or Vox Populis as he wants. He can go after Songbird for decades, pour every bit of his existence into trying to fix what has gone wrong. Trying to do too much right or too much wrong will always end up in the latter.

None of it will work.

Unless...he is able to fight hard enough and use what he has learned from two different realities and perspectives to make a third, most difficult decision. To choose to stay where he was after Wounded Knee -- a flawed person who had done terrible things, but a person nonetheless. Not a deity. Not a miscreant. Just a man. A man who understands the horrific things he does, yet turns neither to the bible or the bottle, but inward instead. 

There's always a man. Always a lighthouse. Always a city. The conflict of Bioshock Infinite is the same battle we all fight, the same battle that has been fought all through the centuries: the struggle of one man (or woman) to find his place and purpose and self and, most of all, to make the right choice -- even when faced with an Infinite sea of possibilities.

The end of Bioshock: Infinite plays out in a series of rapid fire truths both justifying and negating the events of the game. As players, we learn that Elizabeth is really Anna DeWitt and Zachary Comstock is really Booker DeWitt. They are, in essence, two sides to the same coin, one the player circles endlessly as they traverse the universes around Columbia. Near the end, the game seems to paint Booker as the hero of the story. It’s a natural jump that doesn’t take too much to conclude. He’s saved the girl from her cage, killed the two monsters that sought to trap her there, and brought her full circle from frightened little bookworm to wormhole creating omniscient god. In the ending, Booker accepts that he is both men (Booker DeWitt and Zachary Comstock) and chooses to let the omniscient Elizabeth(s) to drown him in all the universes where he chose to be baptized and create the new persona of Comstock. The poignant final scene shows us, one by one, the Elizabeth(s) blinking out of existence as, technically, Comstock does as well. However, it does not give us any clues as to what happened to the Luteces, specifically Robert Lutece. As we come to learn in the ending, Robert Lutece had planned the entire adventure himself (with a little help from his sister) to fix his business with Elizabeth – at the expense of his own existence. Truly, Robert Lutece is the true hero of Bioshock: Infinite in that after achieving his own omniscience, he chooses to right his wrongs and end the suffering of an innocent at the own expense of his god-hood.

Rosalind Lutece describes her “brother” as someone who believes time can be shaped and molded: “… where he sees an empty page, I see King Lear” and he chooses to right the wrong of his past. Robert is, in all actuality, Rosalind Lutece from another side universe. He and his counterpart work tirelessly to finally pull themselves together in Rosalind’s universe. Although it has some negative effects on Robert as Rosalind surmises: “You have been transfused brother, into a new reality, but your body rejects the cognitive dissonance through confusion and hemorrhage.” He helps Rosalind build Columbia with Comstock and, eventually, open a tear into another side dimension to assist Comstock in kidnapping his child from another world. Somewhere along the line, however, Robert decides to help Elizabeth back into her own world. Robert does not record his feelings down on voxophone to explain his actions but one can suppose that he holds certain empathy for the girl. They were both people displaced into worlds not entirely their own. Comstock finds out about the plot to ferry Elizabeth back to her own world and has the Lutece’s killed. Though, this does not kill them entirely – it turns them into beings able to traverse the multiverse. Little explanation is given to how this change occurred in the Lutece’s, but Rosalind may provide the answer in one of her musings about Elizabeth: “It would seem the universe does not like its peas mixed with its porridge.” Either way, they are able to blink in and out of existence on a whim, though it seems they cannot fully change the course of history by just their own hands. In so, they set about righting their wrong by entrapping Booker DeWitt into their universe.

It is unclear the true path of the Lutece’s through the multiple universes around Columbia or how many times they dragged a drunken Booker through a tear. During the ending sequence, the player can see multiples of Booker and Elizabeth each traversing the lighthouse multiverse as they come to their own conclusions about Comstock and the nature of reality. It seems, then, that the Lutece’s have been acting out their plan in a variety of different ways and universes for a long time. That might explain why they speak in riddles and only appear to guide Booker along the path they want him to take, or perhaps the monumental task of fixing the wrongs in what Rosalind calls “more an ocean than a river” just made them exceptionally batty. What is clear throughout the games subtext is the fact that Robert and Rosalind Lutece would cease to exist after Columbia was wiped from the universe. The event that transpired to create them would never happen, as Comstock would never fund Rosalind in the first place. Robert still chooses to force his sister into fixing the error of their past with the full knowledge that he would lose his omniscience and her company. Rosalind states in one of her voxophone recordings: “My brother has presented me with an ultimatum: if we do not send the girl back from where we brought her, he and I must part.” It is the revelation of this self-sacrifice that turns Bioshock: Infinite on its head. While the player must stub their toes around the plot-lines and machinations of the game, Robert Lutece already knows the beginning, middle, and eventual end to his journey. He's already been there at least a dozen times or more. He does this to prevent the horrible outcome of Elizabeth’s eventual fate and to reunite her with her true father – Booker DeWitt, the man he was always meant to be. He does this knowing he will cease to exist. Yet, he still soldiers on and carries who knows how many Bookers from a sad, pitiful universe surrounded by loneliness and despair and forces him into the harsh light of Columbia to repair the broken universe.

Without Robert Lutece, Booker DeWitt would have died a miserable old man and never stepped foot into the beautifully terrifying world of Columbia. In completing the circle and erasing Zachary Comstock from existence, Robert closed the paradox that created Elizabeth, himself, and his sister. He did so in full knowledge of his own destruction, yet selflessly sacrificed his own abilities for the greater good. Robert Lutece was the true hero in Bioshock: Infinite; a man behind, below, around, and on every side of the curtain willing to save the girl and wipe away his debt to the universe.",,True,nsfw,t5_2shl2,False,,,True,t3_1bvfkn,http://www.reddit.com/r/Bioshock/comments/1bvfkn/the_hero_of_infinite_spoilers/,

1364395925.0,192,self.Bioshock,1b41ru,My initial reaction to Bioshock Infinite,239,47,107,http://www.reddit.com/r/Bioshock/comments/1b41ru/my_initial_reaction_to_bioshock_infinite/,"I have been following the development of this game since I saw the announcement trailer back almost 3 years ago. Bioshock has been my favorite game since I played it. It was a game that, although I maybe didn't get the full meaning of right away, allowed me to escape my own reality in a time when I desperately needed to. It let me just go and absorb into this world that I never wanted to leave.
 
Now Bioshock Infinite; I beat the game Tuesday afternoon and I have never been more upset over a game finishing. Not the ending itself, but merely the fact that I had to stop playing. During the introduction to the game, when Booker takes off in the pod up to Columbia, the moment I saw the city through that window and heard ""Hallelujah"", I had tears in my eyes. My friend sitting next to me had to ask me if I was okay. This game from start to finish hit me so hard emotionally, especially at the very end that I was left gasping and crying as my brain put together the pieces, and then I sat there for an hour on my couch in stunned silence.
 
Upon my hours of reeling over the story I realized that this game is really not just a game, but one of the most beautiful and moving pieces of art I've ever had the pleasure of experiencing. I now understand why it's called Bioshock Infinite. There are no words that can truly describe how I feel about this game, there really aren't any. A game like this is what helps me escape my world that sometimes feels like its crumbling in on me, and to know that Columbia is always waiting for me, fills my heart with a joy I hadn't in my life known. It sounds overdramatic, sure, but in all honesty there has been no emotional response greater than the one to this game for me. It still has me thinking and examining every aspect of it to this very moment, almost a full 24 hours after beating it.

1364917903.0,160,self.Bioshock,1biriv,*spoilers* A Small Compilation of all the little things I noticed * do not come until you beat the game*,193,33,227,http://www.reddit.com/r/Bioshock/comments/1biriv/spoilers_a_small_compilation_of_all_the_little/,"***SPOILERS***** DO NOT READ UNLESS YOU BEAT THE GAME*** ill try to update but I'm only human ;~;

Obvious ones

* The girl at the turntill to the Lady Airship asks if Elizabeth is Annabelle, which is a reference to both Anna, her real name, and Belle which is princess, which was what Elizabeth's character is modelled after a disney princess.

* please tell me everyone saw the guitar scene.

* When Elizabeth revives you (yes 1999 mode is a bitch) she uses an Adam Syringe from bioshock, and you're in the grey room...?

* bioshock and bioshock infinite are parallels and inverses of each other, you take a plane to a lighthouse and take a sphere down.
and you take a boat to the lighthouse and a rocket up.

* the songbird and vigors AND MUSIC were technology stolen from rapture

* the song sung by the church Unbroken circle... the lyrics.. god damnit ;( (also it's the first song you hear entering Columbia, 1999 mode yeeeeeeeeeeeah)

* the song bird's eye glass will crack when you first drop into battleship bay.

* A Big Daddy is to the Little Sister as the Songbird is to the Lamb.

Less Obvious

* When going to take the shuttle to the Lady Airship, the people prior to you going up all do very suspicious things, the guy getting his shoes waxed doesnt need it and stares at you, the guy selling the hotdog doesn't know the price for the hotdog etc etc.

* you can shoot the Lucete twins when they give you the shield potion and your bullets do something funky  try it out!

* at the final scene, when all the Elizabeth's appear, the main one isn't wearing a brooch, and booker comments saying you arent... who are you?
... for some reason the one we all traveled with did not show at the scene...

* whenever you go into a booker memory relapse (the gray scenes), the music in the background is baby music.

* the lucete twins when you first talk to them on the boat comment on how booker doesn't row, that is because they have established that booker not rowing is a constant

* the lucete twins when they ask you to flip heads or tails are taking tabs on how many times booker has looped through this part of the story and if the coin is heads or tails, they are testing here constant and variables.

* when you're at the beach, Girls just wanna have Fun are playing... and if you look up the lyrics of the second verse its fitting...
""Some boys take a beautiful girl,
And hide her away from the rest of the world. ""

* when at soldier's front or hall of heroes or somewhere, booker recalls his role in the war and it is exactly what comstack says his role was.

* whenever you go through a tear, you are exploring the constants and variables of columbia, ex chen li's death is a variable, but the death of slate (if you kill him) is constant.

* the preacher is the same god damn bastard everywhere

* oh and im not 100% sure about this but whenever you get to a place in the story where memories overlap (baptism , losing elizabeth) you end up in the gray room.

* the singing slave you meeting during the vox populi revolution is singing 'fortunate son ' which you hear in the locker room area (?) through a red tear in the Fink's square

* when Elizabeth and Booker discuss about Columbia, Booker said he never heard of it which is very unlikely since it's a fucking floating city in the sky. So yeah hes from a different world for sure. ( from BlameMyPeople) :P

* Audiphones made by Comstock allude to the ending plot twist


Stuff I missed/forgot :P

(chance4e)

* cameos of the bioshock 1 and 2 wrench, 

* Tear to paris had the original unpolished working title of Return of the Jedi, as Revenge of the Jedi.

* barbershop quartet sings a beachboy songs 50 years before it became a hit.

(tightestofbuttholess)

* Lucete is the old french name for the Roman City of the city where Paris stands today.

(allthejacobs)

* Music was all stolen through tears by Albert, Fink's brother 

(Lillionaire)

&gt;On the subject on names, Elizabeth means ""God's promise"", ""oath of God"", ""I am God’s daughter."" Anna means ""favour"", ""grace"", ""prayer"", ""God has favoured me.""
Zachary means ""remembered by God"", ""the lord remembers."" Hale means ""Hero"", ""Army ruler.""
Comstock might refer to Anthony Comstock, a US reformer who led moral crusades against art and literature that he considered obscene (1844-1915)


A weird Hypothesis I made

* I think when at the end you see Booker back in the gray room, that Booker had snapped back from all the universe swapping. Because the only reason trans dimension travel was possible was due to the existence of comstock, so all the alternate realities snapped back to the point where Comstock never interfered with them (cause he can't exist anywhere! or it's a paradox) , so before Booker made the deal.  

Misc.

* Bioshock Infinite was supposed to be the original Bioshock but Kevin Levine was unable to push the idea, but the underwater bioshock was much more supported and went through. However now with all the success, he managed to make his castle in the sky.

(BrianChiou9)

* infinite takes place before bioshock 1 (by year)

Feel free to add more below or to argue with me ^:)

Idea came from this post : http://www.reddit.com/r/Bioshock/comments/1bi6th/i_love_imagining_how_annoyed_liz_must_have_been/


~~Some facts:~~

~~* It uses the same keyword as the cipher from Elizabeth's room.~~ 

~~* It's a Vigenere type of cipher.~~

~~* The keyword is still not identified. Easily doable I think.~~ 


Very good explanation: 
http://www.reddit.com/r/Bioshock/comments/1bjc8y/spoilers_i_solved_a_ciphertext_handed_to_you_in/c97hrzn

* I'm pretty sure : is used both as h, f and sometimes as a full stop. 

And here's the symbol to letter key I did. It only works for every cipher that has the keyword Elizabeth was using. Also some letters are missing:

There's also Daisy Fitzroy, though rebels never really seem to worry about gender roles so I'm not sure if she's a good example.

It seems like something the developers had to do on purpose, I mean... Lutece isn't even female in other universes, maybe because she wouldn't have been able to achieve her status if she was?  Is this attitude toward females engendered by the fact that they revere two women (Lady Comstock and Elizabeth)?  Or maybe that their city patron seems to be the ""goddess"" Columbia herself?

""Samuel always thought that the pew on Sunday went hand in hand with the desk on Monday. ""Science is the slow revelation of God's blueprint."" After two years in the Lamb's tower on the Monument Island, he took ill with cancer of the stomach. I prayed to the Prophet, and the Prophet delivered unto us a miracle through his servant. Fink.

""Samuel, when the spells of anger come, I want you to play this recording and remember that I am the proudest woman in Columbia to have been your wife. They said your soul was choked by the fumes in that metal box, but this I do not believe. And we shall meet again, on that eternal shore-- both of us whole and smiling. I love you. I love you. I love you."" - Hattie Gerst 
    
    
Guy held on to that recording for four years, and it was right there in his arms when the Vox killed him and took photos with his corpse. Really hit me for some reason.

My name is Adrian Murphy, the Sr. Producer on Infinte. I've been watching this subreddit for awhile, enjoying watching the excitement build towards today's release. Now that it's here, we want you to have the best experience possible. 

To that end, if anyone is having technical issues with the PC or console 
versions of the game, please send me a PM as well as posting here about it. This subreddit community is great about crowdsourcing troubleshooting and finding solutions, but in the event one can't be found through discussion, I want to be able to take as much info back to the team as possible to try and find the fix that gets you enjoying Infinite. 

Thanks for all the positive support. I'm looking forward to reading the thoughts and discussions on the game after you've completed it.
