Basically they're obscure enough that few people encounter them by accident, but so obviously useful that they dive for pen and paper to make a note.

My four go-to's are:

- If you type **Ctrl-;** it enters today's date (a fixed one, not the =TODAY function) into the current cell.
- If you type **Ctrl-'** it looks at the cell above the cell pointer and copies it into the current cell.
- If you highlight an area and go into the Custom formatting category of the Number formatting, entering the code **;;;** makes any entries in that area invisible but still available to be used in calculations -- handy when you can't hide an entire column for whatever reason.
- If you right click the worksheet tab scrolling buttons (to the left of the sheet tabs), you get a context menu listing all the sheets in the spreadsheet so you can jump to the sheet you want.

Excel 2013 spoils my fun on that last one by adding a tooltip saying just that.

A more conceptual one that I try to point out to people who are past being beginners and starting to make more complex sheets with functions is that =IF and =VLOOKUP set to approximate matches are logically similar to one another. As a result, if you've got an ugly nested IF with fourteen closing brackets down at the end of it causing you problems, you'll often have a much easier time of it by recasting your IF as a VLOOKUP. Basically it lets you ""externalize"" criteria and get them out of the one cell where the IF is, making your life simpler.

As a pet project, I created a website that allows you to upload an excel worksheet, and automatically convert it into a functional web application.

In my mind, the benefits of this would be the ability to easily share a calculator that was created in excel in way that would be easily accessible via the web. An side benefit is that your worksheet would also work on any device with a web browser (tablet, smartphone, etc)

The service is free, and I think very easy to use, but I'm admittedly somewhat biased.

Would you find this service useful? How could I make it better?

The website is 360cells.com(http://360cells.com) I'd really appreciate any feedback.

A lot of questions involving multiple criteria analysis can be done much simpler than one would think. 
  
  
  
What is a helper column? 
  
* It is a column (or columns) used to provide intermediate calculations, sorting options, or reference data.
  
  
  
How can someone benefit from one using a helper column(s)?
  
* I have data in a specific, non-linear order that needs to be sorted then placed back into the original sort.  Use a helper column, a simple list from 1 to N (1, 2, 3, ..., N), to establish your current sort order.  Now you can sort by any column you wish, and use this helper column to return to your original sort
  
  
* I want to calculate something on every X rows of my data.  Again, helper column, this time with a repeating value, ie 1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3.  Now you can simply add a criteria to your formula that the value in the helper column be equal to X (X being 1, 2, or 3 in this example) to calculate another field.
  
  
* I need a conditional formula with multiple criteria.  Here is an example where multiple helper columns may be useful.  Say there are groups of date ranges (&lt;1Month, 1Month-6Months, and 6Months+) and categories of data (planes, trains, automobiles).  You can write 3 formulas for your analysis, 2 helper columns and your formula that's actually applying the analysis.  The date helper column will have a value of 1,2, or 3 (1, 1-6, 6+ months respectively).  The category helper column will also have a simple value 1, 2, or 3 (or 10, 20, 30 to make the combined summed values distinctly identifiable).  The results in your helper column can be the result of IF formulas, or, more efficiently, a VLOOKUP against a table so that you can re-classify data on the fly.  The analysis formula will now ignore the raw data and look at your helper columns, which are easier to work with.

I suspect that good taste will dictate that I continue to avoid most of these ""features"" but since I have only a couple of weeks' experience in playing around with the various offerings I'm not really sure I understand enough about what should be considered ""off limits"" (or whether I've already crossed that line).

**QUICK HITS for the short attentioned or uninterested.**

* Made a numbers [puzzle game](http://www.reddit.com/r/puzzles/comments/10zrob/just_published_kansuko_a_book_of_puzzles_inspired/) using Excel. Excel is glorious.
* Now giving away 5 copies via [Reddit/Kansuko scavenger hunt!](http://www.reddit.com/r/puzzles/comments/10zrob/just_published_kansuko_a_book_of_puzzles_inspired/)
* Sorry for the novel!

------

A little over a year ago, I came up with a puzzle idea called Kansuko based off of the classic Sudoku with some simple arithmetic. While still just a concept, I put together a crude website and posted it on Reddit for feedback. Since then, I've updated the website and now have a [published book of Kansuko puzzles!](http://www.amazon.com/Kansuko-Game-Based-Classic-Sudoku/dp/0764342037)

**All of this made possible by EXCEL.**

Seriously, I used Excel for everything.

1. First, I used an open source VBA macro that would generate completed Sudoku puzzles.

2. I wrote a macro to search the Sudokus for possible Kansuko puzzles. Each Sudoku has 6 possible Kansuko puzzles within it. This macro spit out completed Kansukos.

3. When I started, I created the puzzles by hand. The finished puzzles were easy to get from Excel, the tough part is removing numbers and still having it be solveable. I did this for probably too long until...

4. Ok, people seem to like this idea! I should come up with a better solution. I wrote a huge macro that would start with an incomplete Kansuko and attempt to solve it using all of the standard Sudoku solving techniques, plus the new Kansuko solving techniques. Not only would it tell me if a puzzle was solveable (one unique solution) but it would also rank the puzzle by which techniques it needed to use. This gave me a way to sort by difficulty.

5. I started doing Daily Kansuko tumblr posts (took a break for now) - but this too, I would load the images into text boxes on top of an image and a macro would save it to a folder.

6. Let's make a book! I pitched it to a publisher, they liked it! [Created a dashboard](http://i.imgur.com/I80M5.jpg) that would load in the puzzles and allow me to quickly scan through and pick out good puzzles. Each square on the grid was linked to a macro to turn that number on or off, so I could fine tune and adjust puzzles to make them appealing. Then, I could check to see if the puzzle was valid and how hard it was, and save it back to my master list.

7. Uh-oh, the publisher wants it a different format than I have it. A formula to rearrange the digits into the correct order. Now in Microsoft Word, a Macro to take the value from the clipboard and convert it to tab spaced on the current page.

8. New website time! Revamped the website, decided to streamline the puzzle storing process. Solutions would be stored full length, puzzles would be stored with just an alphanumeric code to show which numbers should be shown. Quick little macro to convert ""000008720005970006800402010008602100"" to ""fhlmsvz367""

And that's where we are today! This wasn't meant to be so much about me, but just my continual amazement at the versatility and power of Excel to accomplish pretty much any task I throw at it.  At my day job (puzzles are just for fun) - I am constantly evangelizing the power of Excel!

This subreddit has really grown in the past year. It's amazing how fast posts are responded to by knowledgeable Excel gurus!

-----

To help celebrate the book, released last week, I'm giving away 5 copies of the book via [a Reddit/Kansuko scavenger hunt!](http://www.reddit.com/r/puzzles/comments/10zrob/just_published_kansuko_a_book_of_puzzles_inspired/) Of course, I kept track of all the clues as I was making it in Excel and any other ... additional challenges ... were also done in Excel.  If you're bored on a Friday, give it a shot!

I've been crash coursing and self learning Excel for the last 6-8 months on a very rapid details ""as needed"" basis via trial and error, documentation reference, and frankensteining custom solutions from the results of forum lurking.

At this point I feel much more experienced with everything as a whole, including rudimentary vba programming (or at the very least, how to splice recorded macro code with some script portions offered as solutions by forum users to perform the needed function at the time).   

If I were to assess a competency level, I honestly have no idea where I'd place.   I've learned a lot of intermediate/maybe advanced things, but I can't help but feel a lot of rudimentary concepts may have been skipped along the way.   So I'm thinking of investing into a reference package that I could rifle through and plug the holes I have left.   

I've used  R/Excel quite a bit throughout my learning process, and you as users are pretty fantastic in facilitating my growth on an issue by issue basis.   I'm just looking to make an effort to fill myself out so that future questions I do ask are much more worthy of this sub-reddit and not something I should have been able to easily puzzle out myself with some basic/intermediate knowledge.

As usual, thanks in advance.

Here are a couple I wish I learned sooner.
The ""IF"" condition evaluates to 1 if true, and 0 if false. This means you can do math with multiple conditions for and/or logic, rather than nesting if statements. For example:

    =IF((A1=""RED"")*(B1=""BLUE""),""PURPLE"", """")

Multiplying conditions is the same as saying AND. 1x1=1 (True) 1x0=0 (False)

    =IF((A1=""RED)*((B1=""BLUE"")+(B1=""CYAN"")),""PURPLE,"""")

This is saying, if cell A1 is red and cell b1 is blue OR cyan, then purple. Plus is OR logic because 1+0=1 (True). There are other operands you can use to do XOR or other logical operators, as long as you go back to the basic binary math.

Now this is somewhat useful in limiting nested ifs, and I know there's already an AND() function, and OR() function in excel, but those functions don't work in array format.

    =SUMIF(B1:B6,A1:A6,""&gt;5"")
    ={SUM(IF(A1:A6&gt;5,B1:B6,FALSE))}

The two functions above are the same, but you can see the second form has the advantage when multiple conditions are used. If you don't know you can get the curly braces, an array formula, by pressing ctrl+shift+enter after entering the formula. If you have a large dataset, you can use PERCENTILE(IF( to do an exceedance curve, AVERAGE(IF, MEDIAN(IF. Finally, if you have conditions based on many columns, it can be helpful to name the range of the first column and use OFFSET for the other columns.

I organize an IRL Excel group that meets regularly to discuss new methods we've developed, projects we're working on, etc. Recently, we've begun to hold a monthly ""challenge"" of sorts. The challenge is simply to take a workbook that someone uses on a regular basis (almost always for their work) and make it as snazzy as possible. The larger and more convoluted the original workbook, the better. 

We're starting to run out of our family and friends' workbooks and I thought it would be worth seeing if any of you have something you'd like us to take a crack at.

We are a relatively small group of people with diverse backgrounds. A couple own Excel-based consulting businesses and know vba inside and out. A few know next to nothing, most are in the middle but can occasionally come up with something creative (this is where I put myself, for the record). 

If anyone's interested, feel free to PM me.

Well, that advice is now biting me in the ass.  I offer myself as tribute.  If our awesome community can help me with this one, I will promise to solve a dozen (non-VBA) posts in the next two weeks.  Feel free to hold me to that challenge.  

I have a problem that requires I use VBA.  I wanted to do it using VSTO and C# (following my old advice) but it's just damn simpler to do it with VBA I think, and I'm pulling my hair out over the syntax in dealing with ranges.  So I'm going to leave it here with everything our experts need to set me straight.

I have a source data sheet.  It can be found here:
[Data Source](https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B8qkD9NvB8dHQS1EQnZpTVlsZlE)

I have a target data sheet.  It can be found here:
[Data Target](https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B8qkD9NvB8dHaEgwelVoRndmNnc)

The end result needs to look like this:
[Output Sheet](https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B8qkD9NvB8dHenhwTnBQbVVGWTg)

Now, this has been simplified and obfuscated to protect the innocent.  But the basic idea is, I need to read the source sheet sequentially, and create output in the target sheet - headers need to be created for each unique team, and within each team the rows need to be sorted by the number of hours.

I'm pulling my hair out on this one and I have a very complicated semi-solution right now.  I'm not even going to try to explain it, but I'm banking that our experts can show me how to do it the right way.  I can clarify in any way if necessary. Make me proud - and thanks!

http://www.techradar.com/news/world-of-tech/roundup/how-to-work-with-libreoffice-calc-1089870

http://www.techradar.com/news/world-of-tech/roundup/excel-tutorial-sales-and-commissions-1088415

I fell off the front page or reddit into this subreddit one day and it looks sweet, focused on real people using spreadsheets to do real stuff.

So I figured lets ask /r/excel what I should write about.

What problems commonly come up here? What features of spreadsheets do you find really useful and think more people should know about? What problems do you have that it would be really good to have the answers to?

I have a couple of things I am thinking of writing about:
* using spreadsheets on tablets
* writing more maintainable spreadsheets with better error detection

What do you think of them as ideas?

Cheers

1350584446.0,10,self.excel,11p9nf,Array Match [Lengthy],14,4,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/excel/comments/11p9nf/array_match_lengthy/,"So, after someone linked to [this article](http://www.excelhero.com/blog/2011/03/the-imposing-index.html) yesterday, I was rather impressed with the things I learned about INDEX and did not know.

But I still have one fundamental problem with the INDEX/MATCH combination that is simply not addressed without difficulty, VBA, inefficient formulas, or SQL.  
And that is: What if I need a list of values that matches a specific key? 

The question has been posed many times, and answered with one of those solutions mentioned above. After reading that article and seeing that INDEX can return an array, I thought ""Surely, this is now possible!""

Only it's not, because it needs an array of rows. 

So I tried to make myself a VBA function that gives me an array of matches:

____
    Public Function AMATCH(val As Variant, list As Variant, match_type As Integer) As Variant
    Dim item As Variant
    Dim results As Variant
    Dim i As Integer
    
    ReDim results(0)
    
    'Debug.Assert 0
    For Each item In list
        i = i + 1
        If val = item Then
            ReDim Preserve results(UBound(results) + 1)
            results(UBound(results) - 1) = i
        End If
    Next item
    If UBound(results) &gt; 1 Then ReDim Preserve results(UBound(results) - 1)
    AMATCH = results
    End Function
    
____

And that works... but Excel interprets that array horizontally ONLY.

So if I have this:

K|L|
-|-|
2|January|
0|February|
1|March|
2|April|
0|May|
1|June|
2|July|
0|August|
1|September|
2|October|
0|November|
1|December|

I can only enter this as an array formula oriented horizontally (i.e. less usefully):

    {=INDEX($L$1:$L$13,amatch(2,$K$1:$K$13,0))}

If it's entered vertically, I'll get a repeating set of the first item of the returned array.

So, my posed question: What can be done to make this work vertically?

Ultimately I intend to include this AMATCH function in my toolkit add-in, since it's apparently pretty damn useful.",solved,False,,t5_2qur2,False,solvedcase,,True,t3_11p9nf,http://www.reddit.com/r/excel/comments/11p9nf/array_match_lengthy/,

I'd encountered it before: in books, in the show Numb3rs, and last night in Uncle John's Heavy Duty Bathroom Reader (#23 - awesome series of books, by the way).

It's so non-intuitive, and I've never really trusted that it's correct, so my skepticism caused me to build a spreadsheet to test it.

Here's a [screenshot](http://imgur.com/EbCdP) with my column headers. They should be self-explanatory. Under the Door columns, a TRUE would be the new car, and a FALSE would be a goat. In order to randomly select, in each row, one car and two goats, here are the formulas in each cell (assuming row 2):

A2

    =RAND()&lt;1/3

B2

    =IF(A2,FALSE,RAND()&lt;1/2)

C2

    =NOT(OR(A2:B2))

There are other ways to do this part, but the way I did it above is more fun and elegant, I think. It does distribute the car an even 33% behind each door over time.

D2

    =CEILING(RAND()*3,1)

A simple random choice of which door the contestant chooses.

E2

    =IF(CHOOSE(D2,A2,B2,C2),CHOOSE(CEILING(RAND()*2,1),IF(A2,2,1),IF(C2,2,3)),CHOOSE(D2,IF(B2,3,2),IF(A2,3,1),IF(A2,2,1)))

There is probably a much better way of doing this part, but basically, if the contestant originally chose one of the FALSE doors, this returns the other FALSE door, and if the contestant originally chose the TRUE door, it randomly returns one of the FALSE doors. This is the door that is ""revealed"" to have a goat behind it. At this point, the contestant is given the opportunity to choose the other door.

F2

    =CHOOSE(6-E2-D2,A2,B2,C2)

This returns TRUE if switching to the other door wins the car, and FALSE if switching gets you the goat.

G1 (the winning percentage)

    =COUNTIF(F:F,TRUE)/(COUNTA(F:F)-1)

I copied the formulas in A2:F2 down to row 1001, giving me 1000 simulations. No matter how many times I recalculate the RANDs, it stays around two thirds (63%-71%).

Weird, huh?

**Edit:** working this out also helped me think of a way to explain why it works:

In this particular scenario, if you initially chose the correct door, switching your guess will give you the incorrect door 100% of the time. If you initially chose one of the incorrect doors, switching your guess will give you the correct door 100% of the time. Since your initial probability of choosing the correct door is 33%, vs. the initial probability of choosing the incorrect door at 67%, your chances of getting the correct one when you switch is 67%.",,False,,t5_2qur2,True,,,True,t3_j6p91,http://www.reddit.com/r/excel/comments/j6p91/excel_nerd_time_the_monty_hall_problem/,

I've also noted that after I change the text colour of the whole sheet to black, If I undo it, the cells don't return to their blank state - I literally just discovered this just now, because I coloured the sheet black and then thought ""Oh I should take more screen shots"" and then I couldn't get it to go back

Hoping maybe someone can help me out a bit with this here, i have a spreadsheet that tracks everyone in our company's training certificates.
there is a column (H) which tracks the last date of successful training, i need to have this cell highlight yellow when it is 3 and 2 months before expiration and then red 1 month before expiration.
I have been wracking my brain and exhausting google trying to find the correct way to do this.  I can't seem to make a formula work correctly through conditional formatting and i'm turning to you to see if you have any ideas or can point me in the right direction.

Help me obi wan kenobi, you're my only hope.

EDITS
so there is just one column with the date that training was completed, there is no second column stating when training needs to be renewed.  For instance WHIMIS training completed 15-Jun-11(h2), this training will need to be completed before 15-Jun-14.  I would like H2 to colorize as the time approaches, ie yellow for 90-30 days prior to 15-Jun-14, red 30 days and less prior to 15-jun-14

1346946871.0,8,self.excel,zgctk,Problem solved: Pull out the dollar amount from this text field,12,4,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/excel/comments/zgctk/problem_solved_pull_out_the_dollar_amount_from/,"I'm not always able to answer the questions that come up in this sub-reddit, usually because it gets answered before I see it, or the solution involves VBA (which I'm not an expert in). But I'd still like to contribute. So I thought it would be cool to post the questions I get at work, along with my solutions. This will give people an idea of the capabilities of Excel. Here's one I had today that two people had already said was impossible to do in Excel:

**""Can you pull the dollar amount out of this text field?""**  
Example:

    Amount : $17.86 debited from A/C # : XXXXXXXXXXXXX  towards the Legal Amount

(Account number removed to protect the innocent.)

Easy, I said. It just requires two assumptions. 1) that the first occurrence of a dollar sign marks the beginning of the amount, and 2) that the first space following the first dollar sign marks the end of the amount. So, let's say these text fields are in column A, and you want just the dollar amount in column B (data starts in row 1):

    =VALUE(MID(A1,FIND(""$"",A1)+1,FIND("" "",A1,FIND(""$"",A1))-FIND(""$"",A1)-1))

MID is the backbone here. MID takes three inputs: the text you're pulling from, the starting point of where you want to pull, and how many characters after that you want to pull. So it pulls a text string out from the MIDdle of another text string. There are also LEFT and RIGHT formulas that do something similar, and should be self-explanatory.

The first input in MID is easy: A1. It's the field we're pulling from.

    MID(A1

The second input, our starting point, is based on that first assumption we made: that the first dollar sign marks the beginning of the amount. FIND gives us a number corresponding to the position of the first occurrence of our search text. So if I ask FIND to look for a dollar sign, it will give us the starting point for our MID function. We have to then add 1 to that result, so we don't actually pull the dollar sign in. We want to start with the character immediately following the dollar sign.

    MID(A1,FIND(""$"",A1)+1

The third input, how many characters we want to pull, is based on our second assumption: that the first space following the dollar sign marks the end of the amount. We use FIND again, but this time we use the optional third input for FIND for a starting point. So we tell FIND to give us the position of the first space, but tell it to start at the first dollar sign. Now we have the position of that space, and the position of that dollar sign. If we find the difference, it will give us the number of characters between those two points, which tells the MID function how many characters to pull. We do have to subtract 1 from the result so that it doesn't actually pull that space, though. Just like we added 1 when we didn't want it to pull the dollar sign.

    MID(A1,FIND(""$"",A1)+1,FIND("" "",A1,FIND(""$"",A1))-FIND(""$"",A1)-1)

Finally, the VALUE function converts that text into a number, so it can be manipulated mathematically.

    =VALUE(MID(A1,FIND(""$"",A1)+1,FIND("" "",A1,FIND(""$"",A1))-FIND(""$"",A1)-1))

So, what say ye, Excel redditors? I was kind of thinking of this as basic novice-level stuff, but when the person I was helping told me that two of the Excel experts in her office told her it couldn't be done in Excel, I thought that maybe it's not as basic as I thought.

He became super busy at work and it is a few tweaks from being perfect....any help would be immense.

Background: This dataset is from palm pilots that were used by school kids to record their moods, location, activities, etc. I am conducting a secondary analysis of this data. My hypothesis involves the students with ADHD being at school less than those without, and the trait and situational factors that influence/account for this difference. 

The dataset I recieved had no times, and because I needed to compare when they 'should have been in school' to when they 'actually were' I was forced to set a somewhat artificial parameter. The only thing I had to work with time was a 'latency between entries' timer. The macro adds these (latency times) from the first entry on thursday (they recieved the palm pilot in school) to add to 7 hours. It makes a 1 in every column called ""supposed to be"", and then based on where they report they are, there is either a 1 or a 0 assigned in the SCHOOL_WORK column. There then a difference column, and based on this the macro generates a % of school attendance.

The problems that need to be tweaked are:
1. There are entries the students sometimes don't answer..they may skip the question or miss the entry entirely. The current macro assigns these a 1 and because they never replied to the prompt there is nothing in the SCHOOL_WORK column, thus they recieve a -1 in the difference column and it is reflected as not being at school. Because we cannot know where they were at these times, these entries will be counted as part of the total school time (7 hours) but should not be reflected as ""in school"" or ""not in school"". I cant figure out how to make this change will still using the latency of the blank entries to count towards the school day. 

2. The macro sometimes counts days that are not thursday or friday. If there is a way so that on saturday and sunday there is never a % reflected that would be great (though not a big deal...).

#1 is my biggest issue. The dataset had over 600,000 rows of data so a macro is really the best option. I tried to go through by hand and add the %'s but it will take to long to complete by my deadline. I am desparate. Any help is really appreciated. I am a relatively broke college student, but I can compensate someone if they can help (20-40$). I know its not much but its realistically the most i can afford. (and it may be a simple fix).

Love this subreddit; I've been thrown into a very Excel/VBA heavy workplace this summer, and /r/excel has helped me a ton.  Right now I'm a little stumped, because this is a question of design and programming logic/complexity.  
Thanks for your time in advance, because this is a somewhat complicated question.  I like to get the background info in, so forgive me for the length.

Unfortunately I can't provide the sheet I'm working on (company policy; I can't move any files off my encrypted, pain in the ass laptop) but I will try to explain the best I can.  

##The situation
There is a part in a product my company makes.  We want to change an allowable limit to be lower over a period of time.  This will increase the demand in the part as they are replaced.  Thus, we need an estimate of how many parts we will need when; that way our suppliers can prepare.  

That's where I come in.  I am in charge of modeling/forecasting the demand for this part over the replacement period.  

##How the book works
I have a list of about 4000 parts (the ones currently in the field) and their current lifetimes in hours. Each part is a row.
Each column is a month; I must provide data for 84 months starting Jan 14.  Each month, every part's lifetime is increased by a given lifetime/month amount.  However, at any given time 8% of parts are ""in the shop"" and thus do not accumulate lifetime.  I'll get into that in a minute as it is the main issue with the forecast.  

Finally, each month has an associated COUNTIF that returns how many parts are beyond the current lifetime limit.  Parts past-limit are replaced (lifetime set to 0 for the next month column).  

##The pesky part
Modeling the random 8% of parts in the shop has been tricky.  This is my current, far from ideal solution.  

In another sheet, I have a random number between 0 and 1 for every lifetime cell in the model.  I.e. there is a random value for every part for every month.  
In the model, there are some IF statements that keep the part at the last lifetime value if its associated random value is &gt;0.92 (8% chance).  

Now this works fine, but we're talking about 4000 parts for 84 months... I'm looking at almost 350,000 values here.  It's a massive random matrix.  I can also represent the randoms with 0 or 1, generated with a generator that lets me assign a probability of 1 occurring.  Same problem; way too many values to run a simulation with.  

With frozen randoms, it works file... but I need to know the range of possible values this model can generate.  I need to know what happens when these randoms change many times.  

##What I've tried.
I have access to an Excel add-in called Oracle Crystal Ball.  It provides random generation and simulation support.  
Essentially, I assign a bunch of ""assumption"" cells; things the addin will change during simulation.  Then I define my ""forecast"" cells: the things the addin will watch for changes and record during the simulation.  I just input the number of trials (I'm shooting for around 1000) and press the big green button.  It outputs a statistical report.  

The problem is, it can't handle my 350,000 assumptions.  It runs out of RAM (somehow it takes about 1GB every 50k values - work laptop has 4GB), and processing time is horrendous.  Even if it could, I'm convinced the simulation itself - varying 350,000 values and tracking the results in 84 cells - would take days of computing.  I don't have access to a sim rig at work (they use them for things more important than intern projects).  

##Help me please!
Thanks for reading through my problem... I'm going to try to make a mock-up sheet for explanation purposes on my personal computer and link it here.  

Any help in making this work is hugely appreciated!

###EDIT: Solved!

Just wanted to let everyone know that I figured it out.  When making the dummy sheet to share, I realized that a few things could be optimized greatly.  I was using a lookup in each cell that could be replaced by manually deleting certain rows.  A little VBA fixed that.  Second, the massive random matrix could be replaced by a RAND() call within each cell's formula.  This means that Crystal Ball doesn't need any assumptions to run, as the random generation is offloaded to Excel (faster, because Excel doesn't keep statistics on them).  
Finally, it appears that Crystal Ball's ""Extreme Speed"" setting was actually about 100x slower than its ""Normal speed"" setting (probably not the right setting for my kind of simulation).  Changing speeds and some other settings like screen refresh brought the time for 10,000 trials down to about 20 minutes.

I have filled out the first movie (Transformers) and would love it if someone could point me in the right direction as to how i would complete this process.

Basically I want to try and use this http://imdbapi.org/#search-by-id so that when run the macros for Transformers, it goes to this page http://imdbapi.org/?id=tt0418279&amp;type=xml&amp;plot=simple&amp;episode=0&amp;lang=en-US&amp;aka=simple&amp;release=simple&amp;business=0&amp;tech=0 (XML format preferred as i understand that one the most) and collects the data and puts it in the appropriate cells. I tried looking for examples to do this but could not find a single thing even close to what I am trying to do (sorry). I also not sure how to handle things like multiple directors, or if for example a movie only has one actor named, how does it skip the other 3. Other things like changing the runtime from *128 mins* to just import *128* confuses me, not sure if that is possible/easy or not.

So to be 100% clear. I will fill in the imdb links manually, and then the macros should take that provided link (or part of it) and go to the crazy xml format page with all the info from imdb.com [This One](http://imdbapi.org/?id=tt0418279&amp;type=xml&amp;plot=simple&amp;episode=0&amp;lang=en-US&amp;aka=simple&amp;release=simple&amp;business=0&amp;tech=0) and gather the information, sort and fill in the cells.

Any and all help here would be greatly appreciated guys. Thank you one and all in advance :)

Edit: Also uncertain about what to do if a cell is already containing data. Lets say if i did indeed fill out the movie name and year for Transfomers - 2007, would this macro overwrite them cells or skip them?

I tried searching on the web but what I found was not really good for me. I am looking for a test that gives you some data and requires you to do some task with it (like sumif, charts, pivot tables etc) and also gives you the results so I can check what I did wrong.

I was excited, and then I thought to myself, ""Of course this exists. This is Reddit.""

I've been asked to help with a conference, and the organizer (who is otherwise a good guy), currently has a really time-consuming, wasteful approach that could easily be fixed with some straightforward excel skills. Unfortunately, mine only extend to conditional formatting and other basics... I only know enough about pivot tables to respect them.

Still, I would like to make this process smoother, saving everyone hours of time and stress, as deadlines are approaching.

So here's the overview:

I have two excel databases (approx 200 &amp; 500 records so far).

One is a list of conference attendees and their contact info.

The other is a list of meetings these people will be attending when in town . 

**What I want to do is create an email to go to each of the attendees with meetings, listing their appointment times and locations.**

While it would be ideal to have a program to prep the emails automatically, I am not familiar with one and would be happy to just do a mail merge into a word document and copy and paste from there (this is still a substantial time savings over composing each individual part of the emails manually, which is where we are now).


Complications:

* ~~The meeting list does not have email addresses, only attendee names. (VLOOKUP, right?)~~ (I think I have a handle on this)

* **Some attendees have 7 meetings, some have 1, some have 0. Each meeting is listed on a separate line, so names are repeated in the meeting database. (I don't know how to address this in the mail merge)** I just want to send 1 email per person, summarizing their meeting list.

I want to know how to do this, but the most important thing is that this is ready to roll in some form by Monday afternoon. If someone can help me write the processes, I would be very grateful. I don't want to be disrespectful and ask anyone to do free work, but if you can help guide me through this in a hands on way, that would be amazing. I have googled this extensively, have worked through several tutorials, but am realizing that this is still more than I will probably be able to learn in the time I have without someone more experienced.


If there's a better place to ask this, please let me know. Otherwise, thank you very much for taking the time.

Edit: Here is a sample file – http://www.sendspace.com/file/qscfhy

Other Edit: **Still could use help with figuring out how to compile the multiple records into one mail per unique email address – pivot tables or otherwise.**

Final edit: So for anyone who wanders into this thread later, my solution was to wade into the merge field codes of Word, where I set up a program to compare and aggregate the records. It was messy, but it more or less worked.

For example, one row may read as follows:

The values of both A2 and A4 are both 1. The units are expressed as part of the cell formatting (eg. #,##0"" LB"";-#,##0"" LB"";#,##0;@).

Thanks so much for your help yesterday.  I wanted to post something that may potentially help someone else someday.

I needed to format some URLs and put some code before them and in between them in order to redirect bad old URLs to new URLs.

The project started with needing to insert some characters into the URLs:

-    Adding \ before ? or ( or ), resulting in ""\?"", etc.

I ran into some trouble on this step because ""?"" is a wildcard in excel, so a find and replace was replacing every character in the URL with ""\?"".  User vertexvortex let me know that ""?"" is a wildcard, which solved that problem.

-    Change &amp; to &amp;amp.
This was no problem, a simple find &amp; replace did it.

After that I needed to combine the URLs and put some text in front of them, between them, and behind them, so that it would look like this:

&lt;redirect url=""^/old-link"" to=""/new-link"" /&gt;

I entered each of the following into separate cells:

&lt;redirect url=""^

"" to=""

"" /&gt;

After that I used the CONCATENATE function to combine them.

=CONCATENATE(D2)&amp;(A2)&amp;(E2)&amp;(B2)&amp;(F2) 
where A2 and B2 are the URLs that needed to be redirected.

Excel 2007, and I can't provide a sheet, even a decently mocked up one, because I can't reproduce it, which is the problem.

Everyone here is likely familiar with the basics of a pivot, but here goes..

Basic data mock

RowID | ColA | ColB | ColC | 
:--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | 
Beef | 1 | 1 | 1 | 
Beef | 1 | 1 | 1 | 

Pivot winds up looking like...

RowID | Sum of ColA | 
:--- | :--- | 
Beef | 2 | 


No surprises so far.   Now, I want to make *Sum of ColA*, read JUST *ColA*.   

Change the heading, no biggie?    [\[BUZZER\] Get a long standing, and annoying error](http://www.mrexcel.com/forum/excel-questions/67561-changing-pivot-table-headings.html).

Now, everywhere on the internet says ""Just add a space"", some of the more maverick posters suggest adding one to the front and back so it stays centered.

At work, I have a sheet that is SOMEHOW ""magically"" getting around this... and I have no idea how.   There are no spaces, and the headings match the source data headings precisely.

.

Here's what happens on these magical pivot tables....

Let's take our Pivot again...

RowID | Count of ColA | 
:--- | :--- | 
Beef | 2 | 

Now, if I switch ColA to ""Sum"" instead of ""Count""?

RowID | ColA | 
:--- | :--- | 
Beef | 2 | 

No other work required... you click ""Sum"", and it immediately reverts to ""ColA""!

However, the field name, in every location I can look (including the VBA Locals window) still says ""Sum of ColA"".   If I edit the cell directly, it's **just** ColA.   No formatting shenanigans with white text here.

I created a new pivot on the same sheet, pointing to the same source data, and I can't figure out how to replicate the behavior.

There are no macros, no add-ins, and I can't ask the person the sheet originated with what black arts she used, because she's been gone for months (and that presumes she created it).   I've poked through every setting I could find, and was even doing a visual object by object comparison between the two pivots to see if I could spot what made it different.

So I decided to aggregate these files into 1 more file hoping this would cut down the file size.  The new file is now at 50+ MB and I'm not even finished yet.

What would be the best way to do this?  Is excel not the right choice for this? Can I use access and bring in the files through that? Any other way or another program to do it?

We need to use this data to model/forecast the numbers so I need excel eventually.  But any help will be appreciated to make this manageable, e.g., smaller file sizes, quicker, etc.

We're looking for another 1-2 developers skilled in Excel to join our team.

When I say developer, I don't mean someone who can record a macro and knows how to put a few buttons down.  I mean someone who rarely ever needs to record a macro because they have the object models in their head.  Someone who has written enough code to have a toolbox of classes, modules and user forms to draw upon.  Someone who has some skills in Photoshop, GIMP, etc who can add flare when branding applications for clients.  Someone who is willing or already knows SQL and how to use ADO/DOA so you can interface Excel with Oracle, Access or other Excel workbooks with SQL.  Someone who knows how to use error catching in VBA.  That kind of developer.

SQL &amp; Access Experience are major pluses.

You will get a test, its roughly 9-12 hours.  The same I took when I joined the company.  This test determines if you are hired and at what your pay rate begins at.  Don't waste our time if you unsure if you are up to the challenge as 80% of the people who take the test, fail.  We have a high standard as we typically work with large companies on projects which range from 25 hours to 500 hours, just in Excel.

I don't care if you have been using Excel for 6 months or 6 years if you can do what needs to be done and have an eye for quality.  Also, where you are in the world doesn't matter.  You work from your home computer, but as the majority of our clients are US based, you need to be able and willing to be on the phone with them during their business hours.

The list of players is of all current players in our league, but sometimes they may not compete in an event, so the data in column C through G will be blank for that particular entry.

I then filter out all blanks and run the following VBA script:

     

    Sub Divisions()

    Sheets(""Player Data"").Select
    Range(""D2"").Select

    Do While ActiveCell &lt;&gt; """"
        
        If InStr(1, ActiveCell, ""Intermediate"", 1) &lt;&gt; 0 Then
            ActiveCell.EntireRow.Copy
            Sheets(""Intermediate"").Select
            Range(""A2"").Select

        ElseIf InStr(1, ActiveCell, ""Advanced"", 1) &lt;&gt; 0 Then
            ActiveCell.EntireRow.Copy
            Sheets(""Advanced"").Select
            Range(""A2"").Select
            
        ElseIf InStr(1, ActiveCell, ""Pro"", 1) &lt;&gt; 0 Then
            ActiveCell.EntireRow.Copy
            Sheets(""Pro"").Select
            Range(""A2"").Select

            ActiveCell.EntireRow.Copy

I am trying to create an inventory system for the small business I am working at. Given the circumstances of the inventory and the fact that multiple non-excel experienced people will be using it, I would like to create an easy to use system for them. So since my knowledge of excel is limited to the basics, my question for you all is can I make this?

Our inventory comes in one of thee conditions we'll call x, y &amp; z, I would like to be able to input a part number in column A and then insert a number into column b,c, or d that corresponds to x, y, z, respectively. When this information is entered I would like it to add the entered quantity to the inventory list on the next worksheet. The inventory list would be structured in the same fasion with columns being part number, x, y, z.

I would also like to be able to do this in reverse for when we sell an item in an identical table just below the previous one for selling.

As an added bonus I would like to be able to have a third table that when a part number is entered, it gives the current total as I would rather nobody mess around searching for the info on the following inventory worksheet.

Is this at all possible? If so can someone please explain how I would go about something like this? If not, any of you know of any free inventory software that would allow me to track the same part number in multiple conditions?
     
Thanks!

In the A column I have dates, and from B4 down, I have the total for each day, which is a sum for that row's sighs. Finally, in B2, on the same row as the individual totals, I have a grand total, which is a sum from C2:AG2 (I don't actually have anything in AG yet though).

I'm using Excel 2007. It looks like they're using an older version in that tutorial. When I copy the cell where I have set up conditional formatting based on a formula, and do a Paste Special &gt; Formats into the cell below, the cell reference in the formula doesn't update appropriately.

E.g. In cell A2, the formula used for the conditional formatting is: =COUNTIF($A:$A,$A$2)&gt;1

When I Paste Special into cell A3, the formula stays the same. I'd like it to change to =COUNTIF($A:$A,$A$3)&gt;1. And then to do the same if I Paste Special into the rest of Column A.

Any suggestions?

Thanks.

EDIT: So, if I change the formula to: =COUNTIF($A$2:$A$101,A2)&gt;1 and Paste Special &gt; Formats into A3, it does update A2 to A3, in the formula. However, if I Paste Special &gt; Formats into multiple cells at once, they all change to A3, rather than each updating to the appropriate cell reference...

EDIT: Format Painter doesn't do what I want either.

Essentially, product category will be the first set of zeros, the subcategory the second set, and the sub-subcategory the third. Lets say we have red shoes, size 7. The sequence will run as 001-003-007 (1= shoes, 3= red, 7= size 7.) Yellow shoes will have a 001-004-007 sequence, etc.

Unfortunately, when I start typing the sequence into Excel, and try to drag down on the numbers, it changes from 001-003-007 to 001-003-008, when what I want to change is the middle set of numbers.

An example of the type of formula I'm using is Count(F50:F100,""1"").

Is there a way to basically say Count(F50:F(value of H14),""1"")
so it will essentially be Count(F50:F200,""1"")?

I'm slowly learning VBA in Excel, but had a question of how to go about automating the formatting of a report that's run.  Ideally I'd run the report and then use a macro from the Personal Macro workbook to format the report and make it more readable. 

http://imgur.com/rWI7Nci

I've attached an image of the report as it is now, after some initial formatting.  What I'd like to have happen is that if a value is present in the F Column, the macro will move down one cell.  If there is no value present in the F column, the macro will select the entire row and delete it and move down one cell.  This will continue until the last value in the F Column.

My VBA skills are very rudimentary, and I only sort of understand the conceptual way to do this.  I think what I'm looking for is a Do Until Loop that will use:

IF(ISBLANK(F-Cell)) then 

Rows(ActiveCell.Row).Select
Selection.Delete Shift:=xlUp

Else (ActiveCell.Offset(1, 0).Range(""A1"").Select

And to have this repeat until there are the last value in column F is reached.

    =SUMPRODUCT(--(AG26:AG164=AG166),N26:N164)  
The next grouping level should use the detail from both.  SpreadSheet Designer can give me the cells but the resulting formula fails:  
    
    =SUMPRODUCT(--(AG23:AG24,AG166:AG169=AG171),N23:N24,N166:N169)  
How can I modify it to make it work??  
--(AG23:AG24,AG166:AG169=AG171) returns #VALUE and N23:N24,N166:N169 should be a single range, not two sumproduct parameters.  
If you can show me the working formula I can probably make my tool create it.  

EDIT: Conditional subtotal(9 would be another way to describe what I need.   
EDIT2:  If it helps, here is the script I use to generate the Excel formula:  

    #formula(""sumproduct(--("" &amp; ColDiv:cells(gY.gQ.gDivQ) &amp; ""="" &amp; cells(ColDiv) &amp; ""),"" &amp; cells(gY.gQ.gDivQ) &amp; "")"")   
So ColDiv:cells(gY.gQ.gDivQ) returns ""AG23:AG24,AG166:AG169""  
I can use another script to edit the string, but I CAN NOT blow it out fully to make the easy solution of:  

    =SUMPRODUCT(--(AG11:AG21=AG171),N11:N21)+SUMPRODUCT(--(AG26:AG164=AG171),N26:N164)  

**EDIT SOLVED:**  Solution is to add another column (D).  
On total and grandtotal rows, D has the comparison value and C is blank.  This allows for a contiguous range without fear of including totals in the grandtotal.

Each student is represented by a number, for instance 303105, found in column 1. Every occurrence of this number represents a class the student takes. So say there are ten '303105' means that this student took 10 classes. In column 2 are the respective GPA scores for each class. The non-math class GPAs have been zeroed out, and the only remaining GPA values are those for the math classes. In column three is the where I've been summing the math GPAs by using an =sum(row:row) equation and selecting the range of rows in which each ""student"" number falls into.

The Example:

KITCHEN	..............B21....................GRANITE

BATH 1.................B25....................CULTURED MARBLE

BATH 2.................B29....................CULTURED MARBLE

BREAKFAST...........B33....................LAMINATE

BATH 3.................B37....................CULTURED MARBLE


This formula should be able to look into an Array like this, and given the term ""Cultured Marble"" return:

B25

B29

B37 

each to its own cell down a column. Note: the above entries are cell addresses, not just strings (if that matters).

ideally, I want to understand exactly how a formula like this works, so that I can adapt it to a few other similar, but different applications without bothering you good folks over and over again. 

Any Ideas?

EDIT:  Well it looks like we've gotten closer to getting this to work (at least in a laboratory environment).  when using the formula 

    {=IFERROR(INDEX($B$1:$B$7,SMALL(IF($C$1:$C$7=$E$1,ROW($C$1:$C$7)-ROW($C$1)+1),ROW())),"""")}

with an array that has been created from scratch on a brand new sheet in cells A1:C7, this can be done perfectly. However, when converting the above formula to this: 

    {=IFERROR(INDEX(W33:W37,SMALL(IF($Y$33:$Y$37=$T$32,ROW($Y$33:$Y$37)-ROW($Y$33)+1),ROW())),"""")}

so that the references match the actual Array on the real work, it fails to work at all. Since I haven't changed anything on the new formula except for the references, I am at a loss as to how I managed to break it. The only ideas I have come up with so far is that, perhaps since all of the data in the Target Array is derived and not manually entered, there may be some issue with referencing it in an Array formula? or perhaps its because the references I'm using cover more than the Basic 3 column format in the original example? 

still puzzling...

Further Edit:  

I've gone into a fresh sheet again to test it in the environment where it works, so that I can learn more about it. Interesting point:  When I created a second array, on the exact same sheet, but in a different set of cells, say A10:C16 with the exact same information in the exact same format, and used the same formula with nothing at all except the References changed, it fails to work.

The report will change everyday, but the second Worksheet will not. A big part of the macro needs to simply take the data from a specific column of the report (subsequently, I'm using an Index/Match to get the rest). My main issue is pulling that data in.

A) How do I get the formula to stop? (I need it to stop when there is no data and that cell will change daily).

B) How do I get the proper cell referenced in the Macro? (In my case, it is B2).


**TL;DR:** I am having trouble with my Macro in referencing the cell I want and getting the macro to stop running when there is no more data to be filled.

I have been using dynamic rangers for a while and have used two methods (index and offset), but both have been giving me issues.

With the offset method, I make one range per column of my data, using offsets and counta to re-size the offset range by the number of rows.  I usually have one calculation of the counta on a helper sheet.  So in cell A1 of helper reads the formula: =counta(data!A:A).  Then my dynamic range for first column of data is =offset(data!A1,helper!A1,1,0,0).  I then make one of these each for every column.

With the index method, I make one named range for the entire data sheet's data (called data_all): =Data!$A$1:INDEX(Data!$1:$100000,COUNTA(Data!$A:$A),COUNTA(Data!$1:$1))

Then, I make one named range per column reference this whole range.  So for the first column it would be: =index(data_all,,1).

I am running into performance issues with each.  I have read that offset is volatile, and will always calculate any time the sheet needs to recalculate.  As these workbooks grew, doing numerous dynamic ranges with the offset method has caused the sheet to recalculate very slowly even when doing simple tasks (filtering, typing anything in any cell, etc.).  It renders the sheet completely useless, especially when calculations are on.  

With the index method, I have read that index is faster than offset, and I hardly run into calculation issues (with the same amount of data in the workbook compared to offset). But, the entire workbook is VERY slow.  Slow when opening, saving, closing, etc.  It's like Excel takes a very long time to LOAD this method, but not long to calculate -- if that makes sense.  And the complete opposite of this for the offset method.  The index method causes every computer I open it up on to freeze for a good 5 minutes before opening -- with only a few dynamic ranges and only about 1000 rows and 20 columns of data.


Has anyone found these issues?  Am I doing something wrong?  Is there a way I can speed it up?

If you know of a good tutorial that will help with using variables to determine ranges that'd be nice.  

I've determined from recording a macro that you can select a range like so : 

Range(""A139:P143"").Select

What I'm trying to do is replace the ""A139:P143"" so it will be determined by a variable.  The reason I'm doing this is to extend formulas to reflect the new values that are going to be put into another table.  To calculate the range, I'm pretty sure my formulas/equations are correct, and I've done them a number of ways, including a number of calculated cells that have the values for the range as well.

I've tried things like 

dim updateCustString as String
updateCustStringA = ""A"" &amp; updateCustNum
updateCustStringP = ""P"" &amp; updateCustNum

and then using those variables to replace the ""A139:P143""

or tried this

Dim rng As Range
        Set rng = Range(OldCustStringA, OldCustStringP)
        Range(rng).Select

i've also tried using the cell (x,y) format, but am not sure how to extend it to a range.

i also have cells that contain values such as A143 and P143 A139 etc

tl;dr basically i have a table with values that need to be moved to another table, and then another table will require it's formulas to be extended to the last row.  i have calculated all the variables, but i do not know if they are the right type or how to use them to specify dynamic ranges.",,False,,t5_2qur2,False,,,True,t3_19lwuu,http://www.reddit.com/r/excel/comments/19lwuu/good_vba_excel_tutorial_or_tips_with_using/,

However the problem with this is that it picks up on the 'West Yorkshire' and 'East Yorkshire' cells as well and counts them. Is there anyway in COUNTIFs to add a criteria that allows me to count only 'Yorkshire' and ignore ones that include Yorkshire but also 'West' or 'East'. I can't just use a formula where it counts those cells with Yorkshire at start of the cell because often the Yorkshire text string comes in the middle of the cell.

The validation is simple, store cell A2, *'1'*, as a variable **X**, and confirm every populated cell in Column A = X, (excluding the header).

In this case A5 is *'2'*, so it would fail validation. In this case I would want the script to say Error on WorksheetNAME.

If everything checks out, then it will move along. 

My actual data may have hundreds of rows (so the script needs to be dynamic in this regard) and varies from worksheet to worksheet  in what the value of A2 will be. Ultimately, I am setting up a batch script to process everything.

I need to make a new stockpile of 80 Tons which has a 14% quality rating using the three aforementioned Stockpiles. How do I do this in a spreadsheet? Of note I need to be able to change the 'required tons' and 'required quality' and be able to compute new results.

**Backstory:** I have a spreadsheet ""catalog"" of colors my customers can choose from.  Mostly they use an automated tool to do this, but they do occasionally look at it.  Over the years, my team has accidentally created duplicate colors - so two ""Aqua"" colors in the ""Blue"" color family.  First, I want to clean up this customer catalog, so they only see the most commonly used ""Aqua.""  Then, I want to keep a record of colors I hide in case we ever get around to actually cleaning up the database.  

**Excel:** I have a spreadsheet with about 1000 lines of colors on it, similar to [**This sample datasheet.**](http://imgur.com/HrHpk.png)  ""Color Name"" being just that, ""Color Code"" is the entry number in the database, ""Color Family"" is the Family the color is in, and ""#"" is the number of items that color is in use on.  I would like an easy way to isolate the items that are not the highest in the # column for their respective color/colorfamily.  Then I would like to relate them to their highest counterpart in the color/colorfamily, so that I can have a page similar to [**this log.**](http://imgur.com/y1498.png)  

My first thought was to use some nested Ifs to compare a color/colorfamily combination to the entry above it/below it and try and decide if it was higher or lower.  For example, to evaluate Row3, the second Aqua, I had:  

    =IF(AND(A3=A2,C3=C2),IF(D3&gt;D2,""Higher"",""Lower""),IF(AND(A3=A4,C3=C4),IF(D3&gt;D4,""Higher"",""Lower""),""""))  

Which is ugly, but works fine for pairs.  (Also, I realized on my bus ride home I could just concatenate Color and Color Family to get rid of those ANDs) If all my data had only one duplicate, I could filter on the lowers, those are the removes, and then filter on the highers, and those are my replacements.  It does not, however, work for triples.  

Anyone have any good brain-thoughts on how I can get this accomplished?  I suppose I could also try to think of some way to easily identify the triples and take them out of the mix, and evaluate those separately.  I am guesstimating that 95% of the entries are doubles and not triples.  

Thanks a bunch for reading!  Happy end of the year.

**EDIT!** - Point the first: My dataset is already limited to dup/triplicates.  That ugly ""samesies"" formula above sorted that out.  The original list was ~40,000 lines.  

Point the second:I did not even think to use the default ""Sort"" function to get my most used variant to the top of its particular color/color family.  Fraudster pointed out that after I do that, a vlookup/Index-Match will return that value to me if I ask it nicely.  Pretty sure this is solved once I look at it with not drunk eyes.  (Hey, I am a low-wage spreadsheet jockey/data entry person! Of course I am having some beers!)  

**Solved** Indeed fraudster's method worked well.  Here is what I ended up doing:  

* Helper Colum to eliminate ""ANDS"" and sort out same colors in two different color families. So, Column E got:  

    =CONCATENATE(A,"" "",C)  

* Sort based on my concat value, then on highest # in use, then on my tiebreaker column (which is not shown on my mockups.  
* Column F got a counter, to decide if this entry was the first/highest Aqua Blue:  

    =IF(E2=E1,F1+1,1)  

* Then finally in G, an Index/match inside an IF statement, so ""Keep"" shows up where I want to keep one, or the top value shows up if it is not the highest.  ""Concat"" is my named range for all my concatenated color/color families, and ""Codes"" is my named range for all the Color Codes.  

    =IF(F2=1,""KEEP!"",INDEX(Codes,MATCH(O2,Concat,0)))  

* After that I just filtered on not ""KEEP!"" and my visible data was colors I wanted to hide with the alternate code visible in column G.

I want to get rid of that error message, as it is an extra click and errors bother me.

If so, grab the data, if not, go on and finish the sub.  

Question the first: Does this sound like a logical way to do this?  There are about 40 lines of code that grab data from Output, although I am not sure that matters.

I'm a high school teacher and we're on an odd rotating schedule.  The way it works is that the school year is split up into six day cycles.   Every student has 8 periods, but only meet with 6 per day (50 minutes each) for the first four days and 4 per day (80 minutes each) for the last two days.  The schedule looks something like this.

1 2 3 4 5   6

A     D     C      B       A      C

B     A      D     C       B      D

C     B     A      D    

The afternoon follows the same pattern except with the letters EFGH instead of ABCD.


The challenge last year was creating a simple tool that I could use to plan my lessons on such a unique schedule as a typical calendar was difficult.  I was able to use the WEEKDAY function with the HOLIDAY parameter to generate a schedule for the cycles and got it so that I could type in my 4 lessons that I would teach and it would auto pull into a calendar like spreadsheet.  I created one of these for each of the two classes that I teach and it's working pretty well.

I've decided that I want to take the next step in creating this tool so that it's more helpful and I'm at a sticking point.  I'm hoping someone can help.


**So I have a Workbook for Geometry with all of the lessons for that class.  I have another for Algebra.  I'd like to create a THIRD workbook that collates all of that information into a calendar.   In order to do this, I'd have to have the use specify what cycle it is (For example, we call this week ""Cycle 10"").  The new spreadsheet would then use this input to go to the Geometry workbook, go down to cycle 10, and pull the correct input).  

I'd like to set it up so that by changing that ONE input about which cycle it is, all of the cells would change to reflect the information entered for that cycle.**

Does anyone know how to set conditions for which ROW to pull from based on a changing input cell?

My coworkers and I have a large amount of data we pull from another program, then we copy it and paste it into excel and have a macro that formats it and sorts it for our customers.

When we originally created the macro, there was one item we needed to delete out of a dataset.  So we put in the code:  

    'Find Erronious Entry - 057277
        Cells.Find(What:=""57277"", After:=ActiveCell, LookIn:=xlFormulas, LookAt _
        :=xlWhole, SearchOrder:=xlByRows, SearchDirection:=xlNext, MatchCase:= _
         False, SearchFormat:=False).Activate
     ActiveCell.EntireRow.Select
    Selection.Delete Shift:=xlUp  

Just today I had to add another item to delete from this sheet, and I noticed that we have this same section of code in there about 40 times, all with different entries to delete.  This seems ridiculously inefficient.  However, I am not an excel expert, and only mildly ""proficient.""  My first thought was to create in this blank pre-format and sorted sheet a static list of all the different entries we wanted to delete, and then stepping through that to delete entries.  However I feel like there should be a way to do it within the macro, somewhere at the top declaring a variable that will contain all the entries we want to delete.  Then, when next we need to add something to the list, all we need to do is add another entry to that variable.  

Does it make sense to do it this way?  If so, how would I accomplish it?

I come to you with a problem that I can't wrap my head around. I have been assigned to make a spreadsheet which will be used by the consultants to capture the accuracy of our voice system (Correct caller details, correct reason for call, etc).

What I am wanting to do is copy the values from 5 drop down boxes (Listed Drop Down 1-5) and a textbox to another worksheet called ""data"" when a form control button(Log Call) is clicked (Is it possible have each log saved to the row below each time the button is clicked?

What I want to do is add another range to the search. $H1:$H500 (for example) for the match and the corresponding $F1:$F500 for the index array. How do I do that?

**Edit** I was under the assumption that I could do a CTRL+SHIFT+ENTER on the formula to make this into a single array:


F$1:F$500:F$1211:F$10013


I sorta remember doing something like this before.

**Edit 2** I guess I forgot to mention what this is for. This worksheet has rows of data (obviously) but I also need to insert new data in between the existing rows. The data is often times redundant so I use the formula to return to me values that are already on the sheet so that I don't have to look it up myself. The way the formula is now, I can only use the last portion of the sheet to find values. Since the top half of the sheet can contain data that the last bottom half doesn't, I'd like to include it in the index/match.

2. Testing this on the macro will not return any values period, it now omits both costs and doesn't list the SKU, this is the result (COLUMN A AND B RESPECTIVELY):

_________________________________________________________________________________________
Hope someone here can help me out, or at least point me in the right direction of a similar example. I've been lost for hours on this already and I haven't even gotten anywhere besides the idea.

PM me for a copy of a Test Workbook which has examples of what the workbook could look like and what the  macro should readout.

Or find it on the post I made on some Excel forum [here!](http://www.excelforum.com/excel-programming/844271-help-with-a-macro-to-extract-specific-data-from-large-workbook-extensive-details-inside.html)

I believe the programming logic I wrote is sound. I’m using Excel 2003, not sure how this effects my situation but I have pretty much lost all of my VB syntax knowledge. 

Source material is a large workbook with tons of data and multiple sheets; I just want to create a single sheet having each SKU associated with a specific cost. I’m pretty sure a macro would be the best way to approach this, as sometimes the Row location varies based on the sheet. The SKUs are always in Row 1, but sometimes the Row labeled ""Net Landed Cost"" can be in a different row (However, it's always in Column A). 

I'm not sure how time-consuming this macro would take to write but I think it would be pretty simple for someone who is as familiar with the syntax as I used to be.

Any/All help is greatly appreciated!

Here is what I need to do:


1.	Create a new workbook, or sheet if it is easier. We’ll call it “Z”

* a.	Label A1 = “SKU”
* b.	Label B1 = “Net Landed Cost”


2. For each sheet “N” in workbook search Column A for the first occurrence of “Net Landed Cost” to determine the Row “X” we will be extrapolating data from. When there are no more sheets “N” remaining, the macro stops.

3. I suppose I need to make a loop “n” to move across Row(“X”) horizontally starting at column B (as column A will be labeled “Net Landed Cost”)

*   	IF Cell at (Column location n in loop, Row(“X”)) has a value greater than or equal to 0, copy the data from 
this cell into sheet “Z”, to the next available empty row in Column B. This is the cost I need. Then copy the 
data from Cell=(Column location n in loop, row 1), into sheet “Z”, to the next available empty row in Column A
. (These should both be in the same row, eg Matching SKUs with the cost).

*  	IF Cell at (Column location n in loop, Row(“X”)) is blank, move to next column)

*  	WHEN no further columns in Row(“X”) have data (e.g. end of the worksheet horizontally), move to the next sheet “N”.


	Here are some concerns I have that may or may not be issues in writing this macro: 

*	Ensuring that the Row “X” is determined by the first instance of “Net Landed Cost” as “Net Landed Cost” will appear multiple times in Column A of each sheet.

*	Row “X” (which has my costs), is not consistent between sheets, however my SKUs will always be in the cell that is the first Row in the column that we are on in the Loop. (e.g. if Row “X” is 11, And we are at n=Column AB in the loop, the Cost will be in CELL(AB11) and the SKU will be in CELL(AB1). 

*	Ensuring that the loop moves on to the next sheet after completing Row “X”. I do not want the data from further occurrences of “Net Landed Cost,” or I will not be able to attain the correct information.

*	Ensuring that the loop for Row “X” moves across columns all the way to the last column with data, sometimes there are multiple blank columns in a row.

*	Ensuring that when copying data over to sheet “Z” (place 2&gt;b&gt;i in outline), both SKU and cost are copied to the same row, and that the loop then properly moves to the next row.

I am VERY much a novice when it comes to excel.  If I see what a formula is I can usually adjust it for.. say new lines if we are exceeding car sales and I need to move it down to compute out for 30 cars instead of 15.  I can handle general maintenance.  Is there anybody that might assist me with this?  I think the columns I would need would be in 2 tables.  Profit and Expenses.

Customer Name, Salesperson, Front Gross, Back Gross Contract Date, and Source. Feeding that down to about 20. Which would take care of a minimum of 20 car sales.

Table 2 would need to be just 2 columns Expense and Cost and then maybe 7-10 columns for me to fill out the regular monthly expenses.

And a final box that has net profit(or loss, in red)

**Edit**  I have finished it, and I am stoked!  It all works exactly how I want it too.

Let me ask this though.  I am really trying not to use my car jargon please let me know if I am.  The Boss is wanting to see the net gains after commissions have been removed.  So i made an additional column to specify New or Used.  New cars are an 18% commission and Used cars are a 25% commission, both off of the total front gross.  Is there a way to have it check to see if the ""word"" in square ""x"" is new or used and apply a % deduction based on that word.  Something like if C6 is new then deduct 25% from C3?  I only want that to be deducted in the final number though.  So when he looks at the sheet it is all right there for him, and he just knows the Net gains have the commission already removed.

Hey everyone, I am pulling my hair out of my head trying to figure all of this out. The thing is I have not used excel that much,
nor even done much programming at all in my life (yet). There are some tasks I am trying to perform with in an excel workbook that 
has hundreds upon hundreds of sheets. I have all my data recorder, its just a matter of inserting it into a new worksheet and repeating
itself where needed
I have written a notepad file that discusses more in depth what I am looking for
Like I said I do not have enough experience with programming, (hardly any). But I tried to outline How I think the different macros should
look and be designed. You will notice I tried to set it up like it was a line of code, but I do not know the language so it needs to be 
translated. I tried my best to make it easy to understand by writing it this way. So that if you help me you do not have to think of how 
it will work, tell me the code for each action. Each Macro I need is seperated, some of them the only difference would be changing a 
few values

The ones I really need the most I labeled as ""APPLYING CITY"" and ""APPLYING ZONE"". The other one would just be helpful.
Also I want to make sure if functions are incorporated into the code, such as if a value is there, insert one here. I want to make sure
it is locked in and no matter how i edit the file, once that data is entered it stays in (unless I actually edit that cell) regardless
of me changing a corresponding cell that was in the function
ex: 
if F3 is ""hi"" make G5 ""bye""
this is all true so F3 actually is ""hi"" and so G5 actually changes to  ""bye"" 
then I change F3 to ""Thank you so much Reddit I love you""
but regardless G5 remains ""bye""

Thank you guys so much I just don't what I am doing here and if you have the time I would really appreciate the help. 
I completely understand I am asking for a lot here but otherwise this would take weeks if i did it manually
so let the race begin for the discovery of who shall outshine amongst the rest and perform this most daunting task 
and pull through this most treacherous quest. I will award you 560,000 exp and 400,000 Monetary units

If you would prefer, [here](http://www.mrexcel.com/forum/showthread.php?t=635724) is a link to my thread over there. 
I have been looking through a lot of very similar threads on this particular subject but have thus far been unable to find a solution that works for me. I imagine that there is something on these forums that would work but I figured it couldn't really hurt to try posting my own thread.



I have 2 separate tables of data, one of them is static and is being used for a reference. Specifically these are fixed locations along a road for utility poles.The second table is data that is being collected for events that happen along a road.



I want to use the functionality of VLOOKUP because it will look for values close to the one being searched for and I won't necessarily get exact hits on the gps location. I would like my spreadsheet to display the closest pole to the location at which the event occurs.



For reference I am using Excel 2003 and I apologize in advance for my data format but I don't have administrator rights at work to install excel jeanie.



Event Occurences



Hit    40.2356     -62.3231    #CLOSESTPOLE

Hit    40.1231     -62.3311    #CLOSESTPOLE

Hit    40.2122     -61.895      #CLOSESTPOLE

Hit    40.2356     -61.532      #CLOSESTPOLE



Pole Locations

P121  40.2222    -62.3221

P122  40.1334    -61.7214

P123  40.2432    -62.4312



Obviously the actual tables are much larger than that but I am looking for the function that will take the locations of the occurence and replace #CLOSESTPOLE with the P12X number from the second table.



Sorry if this is at all unclear but any help that you can offer would be greatly appreciated!

Every week or so, I get two hours in the morning to cycle count product.  

**My Current Process**  

* 1. I download excel sheets from the intranet ([Single Product,](http://imgur.com/a/7jW0J#f9Ss5))  
* 2. Copy and paste them together, usually 15 - 20 different items ([Multiple Products] (http://imgur.com/a/7jW0J#YYKrB))  
* 3. Reformat it with 3 find and replaces, a column deletion, a column cut and insert, a custom number format (so that positive numbers in column H have a + in front of them), and a formula insertion. ([Reformatted.](http://imgur.com/a/7jW0J#8O1Ye))  
* 4. After filling in the sheet ([Filled Out](http://imgur.com/a/7jW0J#r8Cbe)), I manually grab all the rows (and their identifying column header) where the adjustment column is not 0, and copy then to a new sheet in the same workbook. ([Adjustments.](http://imgur.com/a/7jW0J#iCMhM))

All in all this formatting process probably takes me probably under 15 minutes, so it is not a big deal.  But I was wondering if any of you spreaditors had any tips for automating/shortening any part of this process.  I have never played with any of the backend scripting/macro functions at all, but I have played with programming (like a decade ago in college I took two courses.)  

I guess in an ideal world, this is what would happen:  

* 1. A Blank workbook ""template"" that will paste in any .xls files in a given path.  Maybe 8 files, maybe 30. But not 50.  
* 2. At the press of a button (or automatically after import) multiple reformatting things takes place.  
* 3. I fill in my sheet.  
* 4. When my sheet gets filled in, I press a button, and anything that needs an adjustment gets pasted/transferred into a new sheet. Alternatively, anything that has a 0 in the adjustment column gets hidden.
* 5. I print up a list of just the products that are ""off."" for double checking and to hand to my inventory adjuster guy.  
* 6. I save a copy of this filled-in sheet, and retain the blank template to use next week.  

So what say you?  Would I have to spend 6 hours writing code to get this accomplished?  Any single part of it that I am doing the stupid way that I can streamline?

Edit - Also, I am using Libre Office at home for this mock-up.  At work we have older Excel. Maybe 2003?  Before the fancier tab interface.

What I want to do is when I put their post next to their name in the matrix on sheet 'one', it will automatically put their name on the duty roster on sheet 'two'.  

For example, On tuesday, Sgt Snuffy will be posted at Police-1, so next to his name, under tuesday, I put P1 for Police-1.  Now on sheet 'two' I have the duty roster and I want his name to show up next to Police-1 when I put P1 on sheet 'one' matrix.  So, depending on which post I put him at on sheet 'one' he will show up next to that post on sheet 'two'.  

I can rig something up by using the IF functions, however, there is 20+ postings and I do not want to write 20+ IF functions on just one cell, there has to be an easier function to use that I am not aware of.

Can anybody out there help me out with this?

There were no rules in the side bar, so I don't know if this is a place to ask questions.

I have a [workbook](https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;pid=explorer&amp;chrome=true&amp;srcid=0B9GsRxSzis9zNDI4MDc1ODItM2JlYS00ZWI4LWJhMTMtZDhiZGI3OTE1MjBj&amp;hl=en_US) (wb is the whole file, sheet is one page, right?) with multiple sheets. Each sheet represents a rack of equipment (28 servers) vertically, and a list of things that can go wrong (interfaces down, disks failing, etc) horizontally. I've used lists and data validation to create dropdowns, so each cell only allows certain things, like a disk is up, down, pending replacement, whatever. I also have conditional formatting to turn a cell red if it's not in the ""good"" state.

What I want to add is a way so that conditional on each possibility for each cell there will be a list, and if a cell is set to a given possibility, it's location is added to that list. Then on a separate sheet, each list is printed. So when you make changes to the state of anything in any one of the ~25 sheets, it's dynamically added to a summary page. That way if I want to see all of the disks that are down, I don't have to go through 25 sheets, and write them down, I just have a list on a separate sheet. Is that remotely possible?

Again, [here](https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;pid=explorer&amp;chrome=true&amp;srcid=0B9GsRxSzis9zNDI4MDc1ODItM2JlYS00ZWI4LWJhMTMtZDhiZGI3OTE1MjBj&amp;hl=en_US) is a stripped down version of the sheet I'm working with, with a very simple mock up of the summary page.

I'm kinda an excel formula n00b, so I am probably missing something obvious with this problem:

I'm working on a project that will generate several similar columns of data, with one row added every day to each column.  I can stop collecting data when the average of the last five rows in each column is within 10% of each of the last five entries.  As an example (cause wording it like that makes MY head hurt), say I have the following one column's worth of data (with the +/-10% shown for illustration):

    Data   |    .9    |    1.1
    -------------------------------
    10     |     9     |    11
    5      |     5.5   |   4.5
    12     |    13.2   |   10.8
    11     |     9.9   |   12.1
    11     |     9.9   |   12.1
    13     |    14.3   |   11.7
    12     |    13.2   |   10.8

The average of the last five rows (12,11,11,13,12) is 11.8, which means that I would be able to stop collecting data at that point(because the average is within 10% of each of those numbers).

I am able to find the last five cells ok, and averaging them is no problem.  What I need help with is the +/- 10% part.  I need to fit the whole comparison into one cell (in fact, there is more to it than this, but the rest of it is trivial). Is the only way to do that with a nested IF statement?  I was able to come up with this:

    =IF(AVERAGE(OFFSET(B$7,COUNT(B$7:B$46)-5,0,5))&lt;=(INDEX(OFFSET(B$7,COUNT(B$7:B$46)-5,0,5),5)*1.1),IF(AVERAGE(OFFSET(B$7,COUNT(B$7:B$46)-5,0,5))&gt;=(INDEX(OFFSET(B$7,COUNT(B$7:B$46)-5,0,5),5)*0.9),""OK"",""NOT OK""),""NOT OK"")

but that is only the comparison for one row, ie, for the last row (12) it would perform:
    IF(11.8&lt;=13.2,IF(11.8&gt;=10.8, ""OK"",""NOT OK""),""NOT OK"")  ===&gt; OK

I know I can nest the IF statements, it just gets crazy long and complex (yo dawg, I heard you like IF statements...) with all five of them together, and if I have to modify any portion of it I'll have to hunt through that long ass string.  Is there a way to simplify that comparison so I can avoid nesting 10 IF statments?  Some formula that I'm missing?

I am trying to calculate a series of daily moving averages (100 ma but recalcuated each day) for a set of currency data.

The two day moving average averages two days, the three day three days and the four day four days all the way to the 100 day which averages the previous 100 days. Obviously this creates sort of a stairway of moving averages as the 10 day moving average can only be counted 10 days into the data series. 

What I want to know is that instead of resetting the formula each time by hand is there anyway to set it so instead of =average(B3:B4) for the 2 day, =average(B3:B13) for the 10 day MA and so on there is a formula that will changethe bit in side the brackets depending on how far along in the columns the formula is.

So here 305045 has a change in the shipping tier, so I want to be able to filter and select ALL of 305045 (not just the odd one which is tier 2.) 

Backstory/Explanation:

My company uses 10 digit product numbers, and the first 6 digits represent a style.  So a style of shoe might be 242-163, with the red size 7 being 242-163-0159 and the blue size 9 might be 242-163-0167. 

Each individual product has an associated shipping tier based on its weight and dimensions.  Most styles are all the same, because all boots are about the same weight/length/height etc.  I want to identify styles that have changes.  

So a kayak that is under a certain length might be tier 4, while over a certain length could be tier 5.  Or maybe all of the coolers are supposed to be tier 3, but one cooler has bad measurements in our system and is calculating at tier 4.

My list has ~ 300k items on it.

Now what I've done is create 6 logic operators to determine if Cell A is 20% or 30%, then decide if Cell B's value is within one of three color codes based on cell A.  


* Purple30% =AND($E5=30%, $G5&gt;=20%, $G5&lt;=22.49%)
* Yellow30% =AND($E5=30%,$G5&gt;=22.5%, $G5&lt;=29.99%)

* Red25% =AND($E5=25%,$G5&gt;=25%)  


Now as functions these work as Intended, but when I create a conditional formatting rule with them (Use a formula to determine which cells format) It always applies the absolute value of the original formula rather than the relative value of the referenced cell. So Cell G7 for example still uses E5's point of reference [=AND($E5=30%, $G5&gt;=20%, $G5&lt;=22.49%)]  


I found a ""work around"" by using the format painter to copy the formatting and paste it creating a new set of condition formatting rules with relative references, but this has created a new set of problems. So now instead of 6 rules, I now have 6 Rules for each of 55+ cells on 4 pages (6x55x4= 1320 Rules). Which aside from seeming woefully inefficient is also a performance concern.

Then I created a list of the players with their scores divided by position with some other things on another sheet for each position. The issue I am having is that if I reorder the ""master list"" the values for points changes because it is pointed to a specific cell that will change in value as the master list is re-ordered. Is there a way to set it that, for example, Aaron Rodgers' points total will always point to the other row with Aaron Rodgers in it, or do I need to manually copy the point values to each other sheet?

One of the cells needs to pull from another worksheet the cost of a product, lets say it's cell (AG), it does this by checking the name of the patient and then looking that name up in the other worksheet. The only problem is they split the damn names up in the reports and I can't make a helper column that combines the names because the reports can sometimes vary the first column.

So therein lies my problem, how can I make VLOOKUP take Jim Smith and search for a Jim Smith in another spreadsheet and return the value in cell (AG)?

The Problem: No budget, no database software, no data analysis software, and minimal programming experience. 

So at work I have a csv file of around 1.85 million rows and 6 columns. My only tool for interacting with this file is excel. I've been tasked with extracting relavent data and I'm pretty lost. 

I don't have very much programming experience but I have used MySQL, as well as other database and data analysis tools. The problem is that I have been given a budget of $0 to analyze this data. That means that I can't buy any of the great software I would need. Also, this version of excel doesn't support pivot tables.

I managed to get the data broken down into chunks of 100,000 rows per file but now searching for specific information is going to be a giant hassle. 

Is there anyway for me to use the giant file, or the chunked ones, in a meaningful way? Any programs or excel tricks that you can think of?

1. Am I going about this the wrong way? Is there a way to use VBA to accomplish the same ends easier.

2. Is there a way to change the formatting of the reference cell so that it stops using the ""general"" CM and CD?

When I use the Autofill it changes ""A2"" ""A37"" ""A72"" ""A142"" and ""A77"" and I need them to stay the same. Is there a way to quickly fill in all of my desired rows? I hope this makes sense.

To further explain if you don't understand, each cell number right before =""yes"" needs to remain the same, while all the numbers within parentheses need to change. The Autofill changes the numbers in parentheses just like I want it, but also changes the number before the =""yes""s, which I don't want. 

Thanks!

First let me describe what I do with excel: 
&gt;I have an excel sheet that has over 18,000 rows in it. Since it would be a nightmare to scroll around to find what I want, I use the **Custom Sort** and **Filter options** under **Editing&gt;Sort&amp;Filter**. So for example, I can omit 17,800 rows using a specific setting so that I can work with a more reasonable 200 rows. Moreover, the 200 rows comes from all over the spreadsheet. Meaning their row numbers are not always consecutive.

Here's the problem:
&gt;Whenever I try to copy anything from this ""edited or filtered"" excel sheet, the resulting paste is not an exact copy. Excel perfectly copies the first rows up until the point where the row numbers ceases to be consecutive. So, the copy function messes up somehow when the data being copied comes from a different section of the original 18,000 rows.

In case this isn't clear enough...
&gt;Let's say that the original file has rows 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10

&gt;Once I filter/custom sort, I see rows 1,2,3,**8,9,10**

&gt;When I try to copy/paste 2,3,**8,9**, excel copies 2,3, but messes up the rest of the **8,9**. And I end up with a totally useless copy that's generally shorter than it's supposed to be.

**EDIT**: I took a zoomed out screen shot of the problem. This is immediately after I pasted. I took the liberty of adding the red box where the copy's dotted line is since it apparently disappears during print screen. You can see that the paste is shorter than the copy.

They enter their Hours in decimal form, and the cells are formatted as Numbers with 2 decimal places.
The Hours are then SUM'ed in another cell (also a Number, 2 decimal places).
Finally, the Total Hours are multiplied by a Rate, returning for a dollar amount in another cell.

If someone enters their Hours to 3 or more decimal places (accidentally or intentionally), the form rounds the Hours to 2 decimal places.

**Problem**: apparently, Excel will do the calculations FIRST, and the rounding SECOND, and does not update the calculation based on rounding.

So, if someone enters 3.675 Hours with a Rate of $60/hr, Excel will first calculate the amount (3.675 * 60 = $220.50), then round the hours to 3.68. It happens instantly, so they only see ""3.8 Hours"" and ""$220.50"". It should be $220.80. 

Thirty cents on one sheet could mean lots of screwed up transactions down the road.

What do I do if there's possibly more than one match (for use with index())?,4,0,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/excel/comments/1exajr/match_with_lookup_value0_stops_after_the_first/,"**TL;DR:** Ultimately, I just want to have match() inside of index(,,0) not stop at the first result.

Basically, I'm trying to make a spreadsheet to count points for Omaha Hi-Low starting hands, according to [this scoring guide](http://casinogambling.about.com/cs/poker/a/omahahilo_2.htm). (Omaha is a poker game where you hold 4 cards in your hand). B2 - B5 is the numeric of each card (2-10 or J/Q/K/A), and C2 - C5 is the suit of each card (C/D/H/S). Part of the scoring guide is based on having 2 or more of the same suit, as follows:

* Exactly 2 of any suit, one of which is an ace: 10 points. This can happen twice since there are 4 cards, so if you have ace of spades, ace of hearts, 2 of spades, 7 of hearts, you would get 20 points.
* Exactly 2 of any suit, neither of which is an ace: 4 points. Also repeatable.
* 3 or 4 cards of any suit, one ace: 5 points
* 3 or 4 cards of any suit, no ace: 2 points

I use match to find if there is an ""A"" in B:B (that is, see if there's an ace in the hand), and if so, if(COUNTIF(C:C,""=""&amp;INDEX(C:C,MATCH(""ace"",B:B,0)))=2,....). This checks if there is an ace and one other card of the same suit, and those are the only 2 of that suit. If that is true, then it checks if the ace is clubs using the same index/match, and if it is, gives the cell a value of 10. Then I have 4 of those cells total, 1 for each suit. The whole cell looks like:

=IF(COUNTIF(B:B,""=ace"")&gt;0,IF(COUNTIF(C:C,""=""&amp;INDEX(C:C,MATCH(""ace"",B:B,0)))=2,IF(INDEX(C:C,MATCH(""ace"",B:B,0))=G2,10,0),0),0)

Where G2=C (and H2=D, I2=H, J2=S). There is more to do to account for the situations where there are 3+ of a suit, suited non-aces, but I think I have that taken care of.

The issue is the case where there is more than one ace, and the non-first ace is paired. So if my cards are king of diamonds, king of clubs, ace of diamonds, ace of clubs, then checking for 2 clubs with an ace returns 0 from this formula, instead of 10 like it should. This is because the match/index finds the first ace (diamonds), but never sees the second (clubs), so it doesn't give the points for ace of clubs suited match. The ace of diamonds suited match works fine, since that ace is first.

Anyway this is probably too much to just take in, so here's a link to download what I have so far: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AoFnDwRWBjNYdGRJc2tFdVM3SzE3dmoyX1FuTUdjenc&amp;usp=sharing

First off, on the ""percentage"" and ""grade"" columns on every sheet, each cell has the ""#DIV/0!"" message in it until there have been values entered into the ""points possible"" and ""points earned"" cells in that row.  Is there a way to expand the formula so it works in every single cell on the column, while hiding the ""#DIV/0!"" message?

To calculate the grades I used the command

    =VLOOKUP(E2,M3:N14,2,TRUE)

    =VLOOKUP(E3,M4:N15,2,TRUE)

Notice that it went from M3:N14 to M4:N15.

I usually end up copy-pasting the formula into each cell individually, which is a hassle that I don't want to have to deal with.

Piggybacking off of that, is there an easier way to be able to calculate the grades without having to have a grading scale table to the side?  It doesn't do much for the look of the spreadsheet.

It also includes a super simple scheduler, which I haven't had any issues with so far.

I'm really uncertain when it comes to doing things in excel. I'm trying to record a macro that will take a sheet with positive numbers and asterisks and divide the numbers by 1000 while leaving the asterisks alone. I also want to remove any cell that has a 0 value at the end. I'm so clueless though.

Currently I'm trying:

[record macro]

1) Find and replace all * with -1

2) Divide all numbers by 1000

3) Find all -* and replace with *

4) Find all 0s and replace with [blank]

However any cell with a 0 in it gets affected but I want cells with ONLY a 0 to be affected.


**I want this:** 

1067	1004	*	0


1406	1251	951	926	1423

788	1055	961	0	995

S.R. Hatton &amp; Co. is an investment advisory firm that manages more than $120 million in funds for its numerous clients. The company uses an asset allocation model that recommends the portion of each client’s portfolio to be invested in a growth stock fund, an income fund, and a money market fund. To maintain diversity in each client’s portfolio, the firm places limits on the percentage of each portfolio that may be invested in each of the three funds. General guidelines indicate that the amount invested in the growth fund must be between 20% and 40% of the total portfolio value. Similar percentages for the other two funds stipulate that between 20% and 50% of the total portfolio value must be in the income fund and at least 30% of the total portfolio value must be in the money market fund.
In addition, the company attempts to assess the risk tolerance of each client and adjust the portfolio to meet the needs of the individual investor. For example, S.R. Hatton &amp; Co. just contracted with a new client who has $800,000 to invest. Based on an evaluation of the client’s risk tolerance, they assigned a maximum risk index of 0.05 for the client. The firm’s risk indicators show the risk of the growth fund at 0.01, the income fund at 0.07, and the money market fund at 0.01. An overall portfolio risk index is computed as a weighted average of the risk rating for the three funds where the weights are the fraction of the client’s portfolio invested in each of the funds.
Additionally, S.R. Hatton &amp; Co. is currently forecasting annual yields of 18% for the growth fund, 12.5 for the income fund and 7.5% for the money market fund. Based on the information provided, how should the new client be advised to allocate the $800,000 among the growth, income, and money market funds?
Objective:
In proper format, prepare a 2 – 3 page managerial report that details the following:
1. Recommend how much of the $800,000 should be invested in each of the three funds. What is the annual yield you anticipate for the investment recommendation?

This is what i have so far, any guidance, or advice on what I need to do would be greatly appreciated 

X1= GROWTH FUND 
X2 = INCOME FUND
X3 = MONEY MARKET FUND

800,000= (.18)X1 + (.125)X2 + (.075)X3

S.T.             LHS                   RHS

1st problem,  Shape.AddPicture(RC[2]...

The RC[2] gives me a syntax error, I am guessing it has something to do with the fact that the formula it is not in R1C1 notation.

The second problem is that even if I replace RC[2] with a direct address like http://i.imgur.com/FK00DiC.png it still does not work.

Please help with the above two problems or if you know of a better way of inserting a picture in a specific cell I would be very grateful.

I just began a new job with a non-profit company that helps disabled people.  My project is to create a business that will do beverage container recycling pick-up to generate revenue to support the company.  I'm currently working on the part of the system that uses the data of residences who sign up for the service to determine a schedule for when they’ll need staff to pick-up, then export that data to software that generates efficient routes.

Right now, my thought is to have a spreadsheet that will have basic info and fields for each week of the year (week 1, week 2, etc.).  When pickup is required for a particular week, that entry will populate the cell for that week.  Then, I can filter what pickups are required for Week X, and export that data to the routing software.

As data is inputted, there will be three things to determine when pickup is required.  The first two would be an urgent requirement (is immediate pickup required?, is set-up required?) and then frequency of pickup (ie. every 12 weeks residential, every 2 weeks commercial).  Here’s what I’m thinking: a field dictates what week the customer signed up (week x), then fields for YES/NO for the first two questions.  If yes, pickup will be required the week after signup.  So, I THINK my formula for the YES/NO requirements would be something like IF Yes, populate week (x+1).  Then, for the frequency, it would be # of weeks.  (So based on what is inputted, the cells x+12, x+24, x+36, etc are populated.)

I thought I was savvy enough to figure out how to create a formula for this, but I’m stuck.  Can someone help me?

I was asked by the accountant where I work to make an electronic version of our company's hand written Time Cards. All he's interested in is the employee's total hours for the week. And then the Managers to each department gets an auto generated report... yada yada yada...

There are still things I need to do with this workbook, but for now I need help with this.

I'm making this Time Card in Excel 2007. What I'm having trouble with is getting the label that shows the total hours (named lblTotal) to round to the nearest quarter. I would like to do this with just VBA coding. I don't want to reference the worksheets in the coding if possible.

Here are screenshots of the code and examples of my work. (The blank at the top of the user form is where the company logo goes. I removed it due to privacy issues).

[Time Card Screenshots](http://imgur.com/a/k8dv8)

I know the code under lblTotal_Click is super wrong. And under UserForm_Initialize, I put [0] zero in A1 because I kept getting debugging errors with num(1) = txtMonHour.Value (or the other text boxes if I left them blank). So that code is there to make the text boxes start with a value of [0] zero.

Any and all help is much appreciated.

Is there a way to make this instance of counting the occurrence of the same data easier/quicker than manually counting and make it so it can be replicated easily across more than one value.

I have a spreadsheet that has data like [THIS](http://imgur.com/XDH7S)

And I'm trying to get it to look something like [THIS](http://imgur.com/IwYDb)

Basically I want to see all of the mappings of containers to items. Then I can run concatenate on them to get them to be something like ""ContainerA;ItemC"" in the next column. 

It will have duplicates like:

    Container T | Item D
    Container T | Item D
    Container T | Item D

And that's good. I expect that and need that info. The format the first example was given to me would be a huge chore to try and sort through manually. 
So.. is this possible?

Not that it's a huge incentive, but I'll give a month or reddit gold to whoever can help me solve this (if you want it).

I've been staring at these sheets way too long trying to sort through this and am going to bed after posting this. I'll check back in the morning. 

edit: If it helps, it's Excel 2010

edit 2: Wow. I just woke up and figured I'd take a peek if I got any hits before I headed out. I will definitely give some of these a try. It looks like there's several possible ways of doing this so I feel pretty good about one of em working. I shoulda said the *first* person to help me out with a valid solution will get the reddit gold, but I was so tired I didn't care. I just wanted to go to bed.

1357771920.0,4,self.excel,169z5h,I need to compare 2 columns and highlight the duplicates. It's driving me insane.,4,0,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/excel/comments/169z5h/i_need_to_compare_2_columns_and_highlight_the/,"Here is the scenario. Imagine you have a column with literally 800,000 zipcodes. I have about 16000 specific zip codes in another column. I need to compare the two columns, and have the zip codes that show up in both columns become highlighted. The problem is this. The column with the 800,000 zip codes has a lot of duplicates in itself, so when I try to highlight the dupes with conditional formatting, it works, but it also highlights any other duplicates it finds in the 800,000, which is bad because then I will have a bunch of zip codes that I dont want highlighted. Also I cant Dupe check the 800,000 because they are part of a lot more information, and I need the correct zip codes to stay attached.

Anyone have a solution for this? I've searched for an answer, and tried macros and tricks that all sounded almost like what I wanted, but not exactly, and none of them worked. It seems like nobody has the issue of having existing dupes in the big column.

Looks like this worked, in case anyone else ever has this problem.

I have a really tough challenge that I've already spent about 5 hours trying to figure (and it seems like others on the internet have had the same problem, with no real solution), so here goes:

I'm trying import data from a list of about 2500 websites (specifics below). I can do it piece by piece, but it'll take forever, and I'm lazy. So, I have a list of all of the websites in a Sheet titled ""URLs"". 

What I would like to do is automate the process so that it automatically grabs the next URL (or can properly copy the URL that I want), and imports the website data without me having to do anything in that part of the process.

I have no problem with the data import itself, the formatting itself, etc. The problem is just with automating where I grab the URL that I want to paste into ""From Web"" box to import the data.

Here's what I've tried, and some of my hang ups:

Macros - When you copy a cell, the hyperlink can't paste into the ""From Web"" URL bar. Plus, I can't (or don't know how to) copy the next link's text itself (within the Macro) into the URL bar. When I have tried this, the Macro just copies the exact text, and doesn't change it -- even with Using a Relative Reference.

VBA: I have very little experience with VBA. It might be easier in the short term for me to do this one by one. I would hate it, and it would take forever, but it would get done.

Scrappy/Python: I tried and failed hard. I need to start making progress on this thing. This might be my long term solution, but for now I can't figure this out.

The websites in question are:

If you have a job that was cancelled and rescheduled three times before being complete, when calculating the cancellation %, you can look at it two different ways:


One job – three  cancellations = 300% cancellation rate

Or…four jobs – three cancellations = 75% cancellation rate


Which way do you feel is correct?

a clients of mine has this situation I'm analyzing and trying to solve: they have a remote server with a database they need to use, this db has some data which is generated by users filling a form on their website.

Now they need that data to perform analysis with Excel macros in their offices. They thought to download the data they need from the remote db and run the macros on their pcs but the db set is too big (300Mb, 200k rows) and it crashes, obviously. 

I am thinking about setting up a local server with SQL so that the data can be stored on this local server and the client can access to that data through Excel connecting to that server. 

The question is: storing the data on the server but still running the macro locally would make it faster? 

Developing a tailor made web solution would be better in this case?

I am trying to basically replicate the functionality of autofilter, but since this will be client facing in terms of selecting the specific filters, I don't want to give access to the actual data.  I want the user to select the filters on one sheet and have Excel do the filtering in the background and then eventually export that data for use.  I also want the filters to go in order, with the available options in the drop down changing as the user selects each filter in order.

To make it more tangible, I have a bunch of geographic locations, and each location has an ""Area"", ""District"" and ""City"".  So first, I want the user to select one or more of the ""Areas"" from a drop down list.  Say they pick ""Southern"" and ""Eastern"" Areas.  Then each Area has a list of associated districts, so when they pick Southern and Eastern, the next drop down should have a list of all those associated districts.  Then the user can pick one or more districts.  Finally, the final list has the cities associated with those districts, and the user can pick one or more of those.  Also, for all of these lists, there would be a ""Select All"" Option if you wanted all of the districts in one area for example.

I know this is very easily accomplished using autofilter, but if there is an easy way to make it more client friendly (high level people who do not use excel), that would be great.

Also, I've done this before using data validation, where each list is a data validation with the source list being pulled based on what the selection of the previous list was, but I now need the flexibility to allow users to select multiple items per list, and i can't do that with data validation.

Then he wants to give access to the data on the local machine to his employees to perform analysis and aggregate that data, for example if the table was about movie reviews it would be to let the employee select all the movies by genre. The employee will have read-only access to the data.

The download action would be performed by the client weekly or monthly.

The client told me that he would use Excel and Excel Macros, this is the first time I recieved a request to analyze this kind of situation and I have two questions in my mind: 
1. is that even possible to perform such actions with Excel?
2. would be better to realize this system with Access instead of Excel?

The Office version in use is 2007.

I'm a photographer working freelance.  I have a local business that has agreed to put my work up in their establishment at no upfront cost, with a 10% consignment.  I also have two additional establishments that are interested but not yet confirmed.  They would be wholesale if all goes well.  

Based on the possibilities of all going well... I would like to get my Accounting and Inventory in order before it becomes to much to handle by paper and pencil.  That being said, I don't want to *count my chickens before they hatch*, and dump a bunch of $ into a program right now.  This has led me to Excel.

---

**First - Figuring out POS... :**

So... Having a little basic experience with Excel, It was pretty simple for me to make up a table that took my variable quantities and costs of supplies, shipping and any other costs to create total expense.  Then I also took those costs and create my price points at a variable Markup.  From there, I was able to create a running balance, taking into account my POS and variable consignment rate (set at 10% for this ""Order"").

This all works fine for keeping track of expense, income and inventory for **this** establishment.  based on prices during **this** order of stock.   A large amount of my cost changes due to quantity ordered (obviously, the cost of 1 frame is a LOT compared to a batch of 30).  But, if I order more stock, at different quantities, my expense has changed and thus I can't simply up my original quantity to reflect the new stock. (Expense would be inaccurate).

If I create standard 'expenses' for each item (Print, Mat, Frame), they will be inaccurate as well...  (Suggestions?)

---

**Second - ""Warehouse"" Inventory Managment.. :**

Right now, Quantity ordered and sold are in the above table... creating a running balance.  This is *ok* if its just one establishment, but I'm already looking at the possibility of three, plus my ""warehouse"" with back-stock (IE livingroom...). 

 I would like to create another table (or system of tables) that can keep track of my inventory.  Because I am printing matting and framing everything, one ""Product"" consists of three ""Items"".  I would like to keep track of how many Frames of each size, how many Mats of each size and how many Prints of each image and size I have.  This way, when I create a Product consisting of *Print #0001*, *Frame #x#* and *Matting #x#*, it removes one of each from my ""warehouse"" inventory.

---
**Third - Establishment's Stock.. :**

This would/could/will probably tie into my First point, of finding POS per order...

 I would like to have tables reflecting each individual establishment.  This would show Quantity in stock and sold, reflect POS, as well as show the running balance for the establishment.

---
**Fourth - Inventory Movement.. :**

I would like to, somehow, automatically change my warehouse inventory, as well as establishment stocks based on purchase orders I make (for new inventory) as well as stock sent to Establishments.

So I have an issue arising from the columns giving me a #VALUE! symbol. What I have is two selections, one selects number of compounding periods in a year the other the number of Years. When these two numbers are selected it gives the total number of compounding periods for the length of time. 

So now there are four columns that link directly to this number. The most important is period, the equation is set up such that IF &lt;/= then it'll include it, and create period 1, if the number is zero it should stay blank. the other three columns and their data work off this and if a number is present then they do their magic. 

Great, I thought everything was working well, but if I want say 16 total compounding periods, the equation get's to 16, 17 is blank and then 18-360 all have #VALUE! error I can't get rid of it, two of the columns need to be summed which I cannot do with that symbol I need them to be blank like 17.

This wrap up is built from a running patient sign in log where the patient categories are on a drop down fed by a named range 'MasterCategories'.

I'm trying to make this into a table that is easily expandable without knowing very much excel.  Currently the first column is simply coded as:

    =Data!B$6
    =Data!B$7
    =Data!B$8

    =Index(MasterCategories, 1)
    =Index(MasterCategories, 2)
    =Index(MasterCategories, 3)

Where the numeral in the formula iterates with each row added to the table.  This would allow the table to be extended (or copied) and still retain its reference to that named range.

The formula doesn't have to be as pretty as that (and I know, it won't) but I'd like it to refer specifically to the Named Range rather than the range's absolute position on the sheet.

IF tag contains ""-PW-"", THEN cell G4= PW

Return a  number based on string of digits after codes like the 'BTT' shown above.

and finally a statement to differentiate between the two types of tags by character length
