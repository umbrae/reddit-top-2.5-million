1371006149.0,115,self.Scrolls,1g664w,"My UN is Pickle, I'm currently number 9 on Ladder playing Energy, and here are my thoughts on the game so far.",134,19,128,http://www.reddit.com/r/Scrolls/comments/1g664w/my_un_is_pickle_im_currently_number_9_on_ladder/,"First off, I just want to say that I love scrolls. I've been playing magic competitively for 8-9 years and picked up Summoner Wars recently and this is a sort of combination of both but presented in a collectible form. It is really fun and I feel like it will get really big. I'm trying to spread word of the game to my local Magic friends and I've convinced a few of them to pick it up, so I'm excited to get to play and discuss strategy with my friends.

Right now, although the game has been in open Beta for less than a week, there are a lot of issues that I have with both the game interface and balance of the game that I want the community to be made aware of. I would love to have a conversation with both the community (especially the people who are at the top of the ladder) and with the game developers to make this into the best possible game.

I'd like to talk about a bunch of different issues and points, starting with:

1) (already known) The deckbuilding interface doesn't give as many options as I want it to. It would be nice to be able to sort decks by cost, have the cards be slightly bigger so that I can read the text, and have the cards be shown on the left when I mouse over them, not when I click on them. It would also be nice if there were private chat, friends groups, clans, etc but I know that that will come in time.

2) There are not enough Scrolls currently available. This is the biggest issue for 2 colored decks, which I have not seen be very strong since you don't get access to the big bad scrolls that each individual faction has access to. Individually there are some options within factions but certain synergies (wolves) are just obviously insane and are a must-have within a deck.

3) People who say that Order is underpowered haven't figured out how to optimally play it yet. I say this because I smashed Order really badly with my Energy deck (even a couple of days ago when I had a few questionable cards in it). Then I ran into Blinky, who beat some sense into me. He had not only built his deck well, but also played tighter than any Order player I had played on the ladder. When people figure out how to become more mechanically sound with movement and figure out what Order needs to be doing that deck will be a powerhouse.

4) Energy is underpowered. I know that many people will see this and be shocked since energy has op removal like Violent Dispersal (not op), Thunder Surge (also not op), and Burn (very good but not op for reasons I'll talk about). I want to talk about this a lot. Energy does not have any synergies on the power level of Growth or Order where if you let them get out of control they will just wreck you, so to win you have to try and reduce your opponents board presence. The problem with this is that to do this effectively you must be doing this and generating card advantage. Therefore we have to rely on our smaller creatures which are pretty mediocre and things like Clock Library and Shock Coil to edge out advantage over time. We can also rely on structures but those are not good for the most part because we can't move them to follow our opponents angle of attack. Furthermore, our really good creatures that we plan on winning the game with are terrible if we are being (iron golem and scattergunner are both very susceptible to being attacked by faster creatures). So we have to rely on these spells to stay ahead. The problem is that Violent Dispersal, while good, basically takes a whole turn to use and is our only answer to some threats. Thunder Surge can be insane, but if you are aware of it it is so easy to play around often nullifying its use at all. Burn is not very good because a lot of the creatures that you want to kill as energy all have 4 toughness (haste dude, wolf dude, Cannon Automaton, lots of other things) and having to take 2 turns to kill things puts you behind. Furthermore, Growth actually generates more advantage than us because of Fertile Soil, free creatures and Quake if they are behind, while Order can just bounce Iron Ogre and Clock Library back to our hand, negating our main sources of getting an advantage. Also our ways to take cooldown off of our units are global in comparison to the other two, so we can't really do this effectively unless we are far ahead or on the right board. This brings me to my next point:

5) Quake should not be in the game. I'm fine with growth players being able to draw cards and play insanely efficient and hard to kill creatures and then being able to make them more hard to kill, but then they have a way to come back from being insanely far behind. 2 Quakes will destroy way too many boards, and then if you come in with haste guys behind it it will put Growth very far ahead. If anything Quake should be an Energy Card, as we have such little early game power compared to the other two factions.

6) The Economy is healthy and very well thought out by the creators of the game. I wouldn't change a thing other than maybe change the rate at which you get gold and the way that that works with winning/losing, but that's about it.

I hope that you made it to the end, and I hope that this starts a conversation about what might be balanced and what should be changed to make this game more balanced. I think this game is awesome and I can't wait to see it go to amazing places.",,False,self,t5_2scq0,False,,,True,t3_1g664w,http://www.reddit.com/r/Scrolls/comments/1g664w/my_un_is_pickle_im_currently_number_9_on_ladder/,

You don't have to sit in Trading-4 all day, spamming a chat command every 30 seconds.

There's now FastTrade - http://fasttrade.scrollspc.com/ (http://scrollspc.com/fasttrade/ if the link doesnt work)

You put up an offer, sit in a channel of your choosing and watch the people interested flock to you without you having to do a thing.

Now to make sure this app doesn't turn into an insane spamfest like the ingame chat, there are some rules. 

1. Every user can have up to 7 trades open (you can close them whenever you want)
2. You have to wait 2 minutes between each trade. I implemented this so there aren't people deleting a trade 5 seconds after it was posted and immediately creating a new one, thus making their offer stay on top of the page all the time.
3. You can bump all of your trade offers to the top every 2 minutes
4. Want to trade more than 1 item per trade? We have another new trading page coming soon, specially made for big Scroll stores that usually require spreadsheets.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask!

EDIT: I've changed the rules - the limits are lower, and you don't have to wait as long to post again and bump.

However, there is one thing that I think can be done to placate the masses a little more: Getting rid of the Test Server (for the purpose of new scroll testing).

I understand that they want to avoid future 'Noadi incidents' by testing the cards in a controlled environment first, but isn't that what a Beta is for? We all bought into this 'Beta' with the expectation of balance issues, nerfs and buffs, and bugs. We bought in because we were excited to help Mojang shape the game. Instead, the Test Server acts as the true Beta, and the rest of us are just playing a pre-balanced product with little opportunity for content-related feedback. 

I feel the Test Server should remain intact for testing new features, such as the upcoming Friends List, or the inevitable Single Player Campaign/Drafting modes. However, as far as the scrolls themselves are concerned, I think Mojang should reconsider their decision to not let the entire Beta community put them through their paces. We're all adults, we can take being exposed to a 'Noadi' now and again. Furthermore, I think it'll go a long way toward making some people feel as though they're actually participating in a Beta, and not just playing an unfinished game.

1372095588.0,79,self.Scrolls,1gzbak,ScrollsPost: Real time market prices on scrolls,96,17,80,http://www.reddit.com/r/Scrolls/comments/1gzbak/scrollspost_real_time_market_prices_on_scrolls/,"I started playing Scrolls last week, and wanted to have a source of data to help figure out what to buy or sell scrolls at that was based on market prices. So I wrote wrote http://www.scrollspost.com/pricing

The bot is ScrollsPost in-game and it sits in Trading as well as Trading 1 - 15. If I missed a trade channel, let me know and I'll get it fixed. It's only been running for about 24 hours, so the data will get better as time goes on, but from comparing prices on ScrollsPost vs in-game, they seem to be pretty accurate.

Depending on time of day, I'm logging about 50 - 100 messages per minute with a ~95% success rate on parsing. It can parse most spelling errors (Efficency over Efficiency, New Order over New Orders, etc), naturally I can't do much if someone decides to spell Noaidi as Naoadi right now, but I'm happy with a ~95% success rate.

Messages are deduped to 5 minutes, so if someone spams ""WTB Quake 800g"" 50 times in the span of 10 minutes, it will log two entries of Quake at 800G, rather than 50 entries of quake.

---
Prices are calculated using the 95th percentile average, for buys this means it removes the bottom 5% of prices and for sells it top 5% of prices. This is mostly to try and counter people selling items at extremely high prices or buying at very low (I'm looking at you people who want Quake for 300G).

I have the raw price data, so I can tweak these numbers and recalculate it at any time. If people have suggestions on better ways of calculating this that they want to see, let me know, I'm open to it.

The number next to the buy and sell price is how many entries we have, so if you look by buy popularity http://www.scrollspost.com/pricing/all/all/7-days/buy-popularity you can see people really really want Noaidi right now, and nobody cares about Essence Feast.

---

Prices are updated as

* 1 hour -&gt; every 5m
* 24 hours -&gt; every 15m
* 7 days -&gt; every 1 hour
* 14 days -&gt; every 6 hours
* 30 days -&gt; every 12 hours

These are mostly arbitrary, if people want the 1 hour times to update faster, I can make it faster. But 5 minutes should be plenty.


---
Currently, I do not track market data without numbers, so ""WTB Fertile Soil"" is ignored. Tonight I'll push a change that makes it log the scroll, but no price data so you can still see popularity info even if it won't effect the price.


I've got a lot of cool features to come, like a selling post, graphs and more #s, in-game price check and other things. If you have a suggestion, let me know!

There is a lot of content here, so feel free to ctrl+f to find information on the scrolls you care about. Hope you enjoy.

Full Set Review: 8/1/13
***
Decay:
***
1.	Animore: Needs to be castable on opponent’s creatures. Then we would have an extremely powerful card on our hands. Please let this happen because I want to play with that card so bad. Feel free to increase its casting cost in this case. Otherwise, this card has uses but not enough to see play atm. 

2.	Arthritis: Kill braves and vaettrs just fine, but not well enough to be viable. Seems like a crummy poison effect. Maybe if/when “taking damage matters” cards comes out, this card could become absurd.

3.	Atrophy:  Not playable, but do be aware that you can have negative attack. 

4.	Bitter Root: Welcome to the team of unplayable walls. Better than ilthorn because it does 3 damage instead of 1. 

5.	Blightbearer:  A very interesting  card. It has a ton of interactions with decay cards. Nutrition it as a surprise poison a row. Miasma well to help it kill itself so it can do 6 damage to a row. Use it deter your opponent from a lane. Use it as a 3 drop heavy hitter. This card is pretty cool. It isn’t amazing in play, but I love the amount of interaction and decisions this card requires. 

6.	Brainlice: Burn but better. Pretty solid card. Wording on it is misleading because “poisoned” is not a keyword (see ranger’s bane) and suggests that the poison damage is indefinite which it is not. Would not be upset if the “draw 1 scroll” clause was only during the duration of the poison. “If enchanted creature dies while poisoned, draw 1 scroll”

7.	Cluster Hex: This would not be OP if it affected the whole board for 3 turns: See corrode. Is obviously supposed to combo with mire curse. Weak card atm. 

8.	Cursemonger: Solid creature. The curse is often more relevant than I thought it would. Please change scroll art back to its original. To creepy atm. 

9.	Damning Curse: Scroll was recently nerfed to not affect structures and only creatures. It is “ok” and I have found myself wishing it did more. The one damage to all your stuff is more relevant than you think. This card is almost weak enough to be cut from decay decks atm despite the effect being insanely powerful.
 
10.	Draining Mist: Great art, bad card. Would take land over it 14th pick. 

11.	Energy Siphon: Now we are starting to get close to the kind of cards we need to make dual colored decks. Close but not perfect. Similar effect as kabonk in a D/E deck. 

12.	Grisly Graft: Combos with animovore =D. This card has a place in the “death matters” deck and should not be overlooked. Requires more testing. 

13.	Hex Marks: Haha, this card will find a place in funsies deck. 

14.	Husk: 3/3/2 Zombie for 1 

15.	Ilmire Hunter: Slayer is really strong. Don’t know if we really want this as a mechanic and will have to be heavily rationed. This card should probably have its health reduced by 1 for balancing issues. 

16.	Ilmire rot eater: Great card. Absolutely solid. Combos with grisly graft and animovre =D. Can steal games. For some reason I keep feeling he should have 1 attack and relentless. 

17.	Ilmire Witch Doctor: Solid card with solid effect. Similar to Cannon Automaton. 

18.	Infect Gravelock: I like the idea of having “move” as a keyword and hope to see “move 2” or “move 3” as keywords or even a structure with “move 1” (see metal wonder). This card is meh. Again… we need to universalize “poisoned” as a keyword. I honestly don’t think this card needs to have move 0. It would be a solid card as a 1/2/3 with normal move. 

19.	Infectious Blight: Used to think this card was broken. Now I think it is a little awkward. The effect NEEDS to proc off of curse. “if enchated unit is killed by poison or curse damage…..”. Pretty interesting and a chance for huge card advantage gain. I like the card, but it can seem clunky and is often not what you want when behind and can’t control board state. 

20.	Languid: Solid card. Another kabonk effect. Maybe a little bit stronger in terms of early game control. It virtually kills a brave and draws you a card. Not unbalanced, but solid. 

21.	Lifestealer: I used to think this card was just a playable creature. My opinions recently changed about this card after realizing how little combat damage decay has. 4 damage will end up seeming like a ton when you start playing with this card. It will help you beat down structures and idols. This card will become a core staple to decay decks once people realize they can’t kill structures. (Decay currently loses to waking stones). 

22.	Loyal Darkling: I love this card! Its effect being unconditional makes this card really good and should be a template for how “sacrifice” effects should be (I’m looking at you clock library and sinmarked zealot). 

23.	Lumbering Muckhead: Scary good card. Wins more cards for decay than any other card. Its butt (toughness) seems too large for the cmc. Compare it to mortars and peoples’ heads might explode. 

24.	Mangy Rat: This card may be better than people think. It does 4 damage to creatures when it connects to a creature. Kills a brave in 1 hit. Don’t overlook this card. 

25.	Miasma Well: This card is a disaster in the mirror. Please make it affect only its controller’s poison damage. I dislike this card more than others do. I do not think this card needs to be nerfed. It provides really cool synergies. Would not be upset if it casted 3 or had its health decreased by 1. 

26.	Mire Curse: Better or worse blind rage? I’m torn on this card and don’t know which it is yet. This card has a lot of potential power. I don’t know if it is intended for this card to effect structures when the enchanted creature is next to it. This is the only way to do poison damage to a structure and doesn’t make sense in terms of flavor. 

27.	Necrogeddon: Anyone that thinks this card is OP is wrong. If anything this card could do with a buff. This card is only good in a game where you are losing, but you will still be losing after you cast this. I promise you that. 

28.	Oblivion Seeker: A necessary card for decay. Honestly, 3 health makes it worse than if it were to have 1 or 2. Wouldn’t be opposed to those type of changes, but the card is pretty solid. I just find myself wishing it would die already. 

29.	Pestis: So close to playable by itself. Relentless will proc this multiple times. I have high hopes in the future for this card, but this card will be benched with the current pool of cards. 

30.	Pillar of Disease: Ug….

31.	Pillar of Fatigue: Double Ug….. both these cards could do with a buff. If they had double their effects I’d be willing to start talking about these cards. Also, this needs to trigger with rumble. It currently doesn't just like searing shackles. Change the code of pother and rumble to the move trigger. 

32.	Puppet Soldier: Works with nutrition =D. 

33.	Regeniture: I like the idea of increasing my creature’s health pool. I don’t want to spend a card to do this though. Cool art, would like to see the effect on a cursemonger type card. 

34.	Restless Bones: I have really high hopes for this card and could see myself screaming for nerfs in the future but for right now, not enough targets for the effect. 

35.	Return To Nature: Why is energy siphon unconditional and this isn’t? Please make the growth gain unconditional. Currently, the conditions are sometimes even obtainable. You have to kill a creature with the spell itself to gain growth. You can only gain one growth total. Would love to be able to gain multiple growth with the card. That could be a worthwhile effect. 

36.	Scavenger Construct: Better than useless contraption. 

37.	Searing Shackles: My god I want this card to be good. I want to make this card playable. Its effects are super huge and could win games. Kill a creature, put it on a structure and let it finish an idol for you. Like…. These are strong things to do. I want the 2 damage to proc off of pothers and rumble for cool interactions and the wording does infer that I can do that but it is not coded that way. Please reword or recode. (Hopefully recode because I want to pother braves to kill them ^_^)

38.	Shroud of Unlife:  This should make two husks… otherwise why don’t I just play husk (which I wouldn’t do anyways). 

39.	Soul Scrounger: This is a super cool creature name. Just saying. The effect is fine. Might be more playable then people think. 

40.	Soul Steal: I’ve come to find this card to be unplayable. Wish it just did 2 damage and if a creature died make a muckhead. Currently, you’ll find yourself with zero targets for this unless you are against growth.

41.	Staggering Muckhead: Damn you RNG for ruining things that are almost good. 

42.	Tethered Recruit: Probably the best memorial in the game. 

43.	Totem of Suffering: This card might be nuts. I don’t know yet. Its effect is stronger than you think since you can control it. It is very similar to blood artist (so rat spam and necrogeddon them all)

44.	Unbind: It is fine. 

45.	Viscera Sage: There is value to be had in this card. It is just hard to get out of it. Fine creature
***
Energy:
***
1.	Corrode: Ok, so as is this card is way too expensive. It is best friends with essence feast. My suggestion for this card is adding a new mechanic of static effects. Let this effect last for 3 turns. I would consider playing that in an agro deck. Spend 4 turns building a board then try to finish my op over the next 3 turns after playing this card. It would be pretty easy to implement, just put the card with a timer under the players name on the UI. This mechanic could honestly lend itself to a lot of cool card designs in the future. 

2.	Storm Runner: Cool and logical step in card design. Stats aren’t right. Would rather it cost more and do more. As is, requires too much work to make it do stuff, but the idea is solid. “but this card is mangonel – speed - focus if you have it, bombard, and desperation” it is absolutely but energy does not have IR to help fill its hand with that combo. The card really is just too big in terms of art. It doesn’t make sense when on board. 

3.	Metal Wonder: Despite what iscream would say, this card is unplayable. I would play it (maybe) if the effect occurred only on the row where metal wonder was located and then I could pay mana to move it one tile or something. 

4.	Solemn Giant: People will disagree with me, but solemn giant will be the savior to energy. This is the best card to ever be printed for energy. I promise you. 
***
Growth:
***
1.	Crone: Doing its worst puppet soldier impression

2.	Sister of the Bear: 4/2/4 for 4. I would love this to have interactions with bear paw, like not have it gain 1 cd when it comes into play and then have new art assets of it becoming a bear. Would at a lot of depth to flavor which is important to some people. The model art is great. 

3.	Breaker: Solid three drop creature that is much needed in growth decks. 

4.	Rat King: Oh boy this card is dumb.  Understand this card was patched immediately to cost 4 instead of 3. This is not the proper fix for this card. At 4 the card is still a 3/6 for 4 across 3 bodies (which is good for crimson bulls and godhands) but is super clunky because you can no longer get fertile soil value and joins the ever increasing list of 4 drops. Please keep it at 3 and only produce 2 rats.
***
Order:
***
1.	Wings Shield: Seems solid. I like the idea of “x” effects.

2.	Wings Soldier: 3/2/2 for 2. Won’t see play probably besides in the GO 2/2 deck. It is just worse than x-bowman

3.	Fleetness: Ok… so when I first saw this, like everyone else I thought this card was broken and should be nerfed immediately. And thus it was… it now costs 3 on the test server. Then I played it and thought, “meh”, then I played it again and said, “ug”, THEN I played it a third time and removed it from my deck immediately after. To save myself the reply in the comments I’m going to lengthily explain this card here. So this is an enchantment which is generally considered bad. The only good ones have immediate effects of saving or killing a unit you otherwise wouldn’t be able to: i.e., potion of resistance or stagheart. This card has NO IMMEDIATE effects and requires an entire attack rotation to even become relevant. It effect is cool but it often won’t do anything for at least 3-4 turns. I never expect a creature to last more than one combat cycle anyways unless I have accelerants. This does not accelerate. Maybe in some kind of potion resistance build this card can find a place but does not need a nerf at all. I personally wouldn’t run it even if it costed 1. 

4.	Redeploy: Why does this cost 5, probably wouldn’t play it even if it casted 2.

1371739550.0,77,self.Scrolls,1gq9l3,Low gold reward for losing encourages quitting prematurely,88,11,63,http://www.reddit.com/r/Scrolls/comments/1gq9l3/low_gold_reward_for_losing_encourages_quitting/,"Am I missing something or does the gold reward distribution not clearly incentivise gg'ing out of a game you're behind in?

In my experience you get about 60-70g per loss and 350-375 per win.

If I think I have a 20% chance to win (not high, but substantial), why should I play the game out for another 20 minutes if I'm only going to get 65 gold when I'll probably lose? I could just start another game and have a (roughly) 50% chance at getting 370 gold. 

I'd like to see the gold reward based more on a function of time rather than win/loss. I want to feel encouraged to pursue epic hour-long comebacks and such without feeling like I'm hindering my income.

I understand that there is potential for abuse, such as players just agreeing to draw a game out for more gold, but I think we could come up with ideas to balance it out. 

The current way of abusing the system would be to just keep quitting games at turn one until you get what you think is a winning hand. This form of abuse is much more annoying as the two players aren't agreeing to abuse together, so one person has their time wasted in this case having to find another match.

In the last month, June 16th to July 16th there have been a total of six new cards released. To be more granular there were two releases of 3 cards each, fifteen days apart. As of the making this post there has been a 13 day period without even a mention of any new cards. 

There were an additional three cards teased nearly a month ago along side the last released three. They have been on the test servers for weeks now, without a single word on their possible release or changes, or progress. 

This might not be so awful if there weren't currently only 141 scrolls available. And this is the crux of what I believe gives us the cause for concern.

Scrolls is a self titled ""beta"" and only recently released. Which excuses the extremely low card pool. Yet simultaneously it makes the maddeningly quiet development all the more strange. 

This is a brand new baby, we should be seeing huge spurts of growth and heaps of attention being lavished into our newborn. When in reality we are being teased with the occasional card or non-game play related feature before the devs vanish back into the shadows.

For a game supposedly in its developmental stage, we aren't seeing or hearing about much development. There is taking your time, and there is moving incompetently slow. A month and a half to add 6 cards to one of the smallest tcg card pools out there certainly looks more like one than the other.

1375397518.0,71,self.Scrolls,1jizm1,"As we approach Scrolls' first big set, I hope Mojang keeps in mind that it is a computer game, not a print TCG",90,19,48,http://www.reddit.com/r/Scrolls/comments/1jizm1/as_we_approach_scrolls_first_big_set_i_hope/,"I've been playing Magic off-and-on since the late 90s, and I can tell you there is a ridiculous amount of redundancy and bad cards printed in every single set in Magic. This is a consequence of a print TCG, where every player needs to be able to throw together a deck only using boosters from a single set, and where you can't edit a card post-release, so a card that doesn't achieve what it set out to do is forever worthless. There is so much junk in MTG as a result that you can have a collection of thousands of cards and still not have a single card that is competitive-level.

That's because only a shockingly small percentage of cards that Wizards prints actually see usage in tournaments. Wizards even invented a format called Standard which only uses the most recent blocks of cards so as to have some format where new cards could be relevant in a scale big enough to encourage interest in the new sets. Only an incredibly tiny amount of cards will survive to Modern (and usually none or almost none for Legacy). Wizards prints about 500 new cards a year, and yet only about 45 of them will hold any lasting meaning or value. That's not very healthy for a game's meta.

Scrolls, as a computer game, has the unique capability to ameliorate these woes that plague a traditional print TCG. Because Mojang can actually patch cards post-release, they can finetune balance instead of merely banning OP cards and letting weaker cards just disappear into the milieu. They should take a cue from League of Legends, which has an entire team of employees focused purely on preserving balance, and focus on increasing the pool of viability. Viable cards &gt; junk, and with the ability to patch cards, I don't see why we need to have junk.

I'm going to say it now, and it will mentally conflict with those of you who are fellow print TCG players, but please listen. Every single card in Scrolls should be useful. Every single one. That doesn't mean every single card should feel at home in any deck, because TCGs thrive on options and situational cards, but there should be a place for every single card. Perhaps its very niche, perhaps it only fits in with a certain kind of combo deck, or maybe its only good against a certain color or deck type, but somewhere, no matter how small, there should be a place where that card is viable. If a card is bad and has no place in any competitive deck whatsoever, then Mojang really should take the opportunity to either balance it, or balance the cards that raise the power-level above that card, or print new cards that fit in with the old card.

I know it'll be hard, and all the concerns of balance will give us plenty to argue about, just like with League's heavy balancing, and yes, most likely Mojang will have to slow the release of cards down slightly to compensate, but I think a culture of fine-tuned balance instead of Magic's fire-and-forget printing style will result in a drastically better game. The upside of this is that competitive players only play with viable cards, and balancing will drastically increase the amount of viable cards whereas straight printing will only increase the pool of viable cards very gradually.

And frankly, with patching, there just isn't an excuse for bad cards. Nobody likes them, and if Mojang has the ability to fix them, why keep them? The gap between pros and newbs shouldn't be just what cards they're using, it should be HOW they're using their cards and how they arrange their decks with those cards. Yes, the balance will never be perfect, and not EVERY card will be useful, but Mojang is a talented enough group of people that I believe that they can get reasonably close.

The reason a computer TCG is exciting is the ability to edit cards post-release and create a deeply balanced game. If Mojang doesn't utilize this strength, then I'm afraid Scrolls will never see its true potential.

I want to test the waters of interest via this post. Please actually upvote/downvote it accordingly because I will not consider it past this point if there is not an overwhelming community response. For purposes of this post I'm going to be assuming I'm actually doing it to help illustrate the tournament itself along with other points. 

Introducing the **Scrolls Pro Tour**, an official Mojang supported cash tournament that anyone can participate in for free! The Pro Tour consists of daily tournaments, called Pro Tour Qualifiers or PTQs for short, in both EU and US friendly timezones that anyone can participate in for free. Each of these PTQs will have a small cash prize for the winner along with guaranteeing an invitation to the top 2 to join in the final tournament, the Pro Tour Championship. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Pro Tour Championship will have a ______ Prize Pool that will paid down to the top 8. The tournament will have over 150 of the worlds top performing competitors weeded through using the PTQs playing through a 8 round Swiss style tournament. Top 8 competitors will be celebrated through twitch, forums, and even having their decks posted on Scrolls.com's front page. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is my very initial concept of the tournament. I've discussed this on my stream and had a pretty positive response along with getting confirmation from other streamers that they can help me host tournaments if/when the time comes. Here's a list of things that would need to happen in order for me to actually move ahead with this:

* This post gets extremely upvoted, talked about through other sources like scrollsguide.com and have positive response at these places as well. 
* A community call to arms to strong arm Mojang into actually endorsing this tournament financially and verbally. It is not our responsibility as a community to make this game competitive for ourselves. It is cool that we can host our own cash tournaments but it isn't fair to us and I won't host this tournament unless Mojang drops $2-3k into this tournament (This is bear minimum 5k+ would honestly be preferred). If this tournament does flop (which I don't have a problem with) this will at least be a valuable learning experience for the community to see how invested Mojang is in supporting us. 
* I need to find a way to pay myself and other streamers. Whether I skim some off of the prize pool or w/e, the amount of daily logistic work is too much for myself and anyone else I have work with me to at least not get some form of compensation. We will be streaming games from all the PTQs and every single game from the Pro Tour Championship will be covered live. 
* We as a community will have to come up with a schedule that can work for as many people as possible. 
* Lastly myself and whoever else wants to help, will have to help advertise the tournament through third party videogame websites like Kotaku &amp; the escapist. This phase will be very valuable to spreading interest and is another reason why I NEED Mojang support.

Anyways, thanks for reading this. Hope you like the idea and will help me endorse it. I will be responding to all reasonable comments. Please remember, this is very early conceptual stage and any and all details are open to change. 

EDIT: Guess there are a couple of points I'd like to clear up:

* This wouldn't happen for months. If it were to happen I'd like for the championship to coincide with the official release date. 
* When I mean pay myself and other... I'm talking like 1-2 dollars an hour to help encourage myself and others to provide the most professional content possible. Especially considering that running the tournaments would almost consume my entire life for the month that the tournament is run. 

Please don't think of this starting tomorrow. This is meant to be a large professional event used to advertise the game. I ask you to view further into the future. Hope this helps clear some things up. ",,False,self,t5_2scq0,1373944360.0,,flair-growth,True,t3_1icvp0,http://www.reddit.com/r/Scrolls/comments/1icvp0/scrolls_pro_tour_initial_concept/,

This came about while I was attempting to track my collection data in the quest to acquire a full playset.  Originally I was using a google Spreadsheet, which eventually evolved into a small application, and with the launch of Summoner ModLoader was able to be fully realized with in-game integration.  Full information about the technical stack for the site is in the FAQ section, and both the MOD and the site are open source, available from [my github](https://github.com/Tidwell?tab=repositories).

*****

~~It appears there is a bug when you have around 1000 scrolls you are trying to sync - not quite sure what the exact number is, but its definitely over 700.  I'll be resolving this for the next release as soon as I can get to the bottom of it.~~

This bug has been fixed in version 1.2 of the CollectionSync MOD. Restart Scrolls to auto-update.

*****

In the next few days I plan to be adding:  
- Additional support for ScrollsPost and trading.ScrollsGuide pricing and aggregation  
- Exclude Checkbox (so those pesky Junkyards and Ilthorns won't show up in your generated lists)  
- Quantity overrides (maybe you want 5 speeds?)  
- Remember Me for Login  
- Developer REST API so you can grab a user's collection info based on their in-game name without having to write a MOD  
- Additonal Settings and server-side option storage  
- Card image updates to reflect the latest changes

Any bug reports, feature requests, questions, comments, or hate mail can be posted here, sent via email to Aaron.Tidwell@gmail.com or sent to [@Tidwell](http://www.twitter.com/tidwell) on twitter.

Some Thank-Yous:

Huge thank-you to ScrollsPC, trading.scrollsguide and ScrollsPost - everyone I've talked to has been awesome and willing to share their data and even develop new features just to make my life easier.  I highly recommend using one of their sites for up-to-the minute price analysis.

Super-Huge thanks to KBasten and Darkulix, without their tireless work on Summoner and being patient while a Javascript guy tries to learn C#, there would be no CollectionSync Mod.

Also, a big thank you to the [ScrollsGuide](http://www.scrollsguide.com) community and everyone who has tested or given feedback during development, of which there are far too many to list. Special thanks to my IRL coworkers j0shua and detour!

And of course, Mojang for creating an amazing game.

Before we start, let me say thanks to fellow redditor /u/s3n5ai for giving me the idea of doing this (hopefully) daily thread.

With that out of the way, let's get right to it!

The daily discussion will be a place to discuss one scroll, that scroll being different everyday. Talk about your opinion of said scroll, how you use the scroll, how you counter the scroll, or ask questions about the scroll, I'm guessing you get the gist of this.

So for discussion #1, instead of going alphabetically, I thought, let's take a very well known and very used scroll, the infamous Kinfolk Brave.

Kinfolk Brave - 2 Growth

2 Attack

1 Cool Down

2 Health

You most likely all know him, that bastard with the little sword, doesn't look like much until he gets just a little buffed and starts pommeling away at you.

If he isn't played against me, you will most certainly find me playing him, seeing as he is the integral part of my growth/order weenie deck. If I manage to buff 2 of those little bastards up with some crowns, and have a few focus scrolls in my hand, nothing is going to stop me from wrecking a lane, unless the opponent shuts him down quickly.

That in my opinion is the 'tricky' aspect of this scroll: If you don't buff him up, you can bet your ass you will lose him in a round or two. Once buffed though, he is an unstoppable force.

So reddit, your opinion on this bravest of kinfolk?

(feedback on the whole 'daily scrolls' things also very appreciated, if no one likes it I won't bother you with it)

Then Scrolls came along and it's perfect for me.  It allows me to play in small, controlled bursts when I have time.  Since I play at lunch at work or in the evening when I might have to run off to play Hot Wheels with my son, I mostly play against the AI so I don't have to worry about someone else waiting or my 90 second turn clock.

Here is what would make an awesome game even better for a guy like me:

1)  **Correspondence games** - A different type of match with maybe a 24 hour turn clock.  Not that every turn would take that long, but it makes it flexible enough to even play with people on the other side of the world.  You would have to be able to play at least 3-5 of these at a time in addition to 1 live or AI game.  Sate would have to be saved on the server between sessions.  This would let me play games more easily with my other working Dad friends, a turn here and there as we find time.

2)  **Harder AI** - I've been playing the AI a LOT and really working on my deck.  I can now beat the Hard AI pretty much every time.  It would be nice to have even more challenging AIs to play against.  Maybe even give the AI decks from some of the top players.

Hopefully these sound like good additions to other people too, if I am lucky Mojang will even notice.",,False,self,t5_2scq0,False,,flair-growth,True,t3_1gxydo,http://www.reddit.com/r/Scrolls/comments/1gxydo/scrolls_ideas_from_a_working_dad_correspondence/,

Here's deck I'm currently using: http://www.scrollsguide.com/deckbuilder/#2917

3x Gravelock Elder

Gravelock Elders are one of the strongest units energy has. They might not be as good when they are on board alone, but if you can get at least 2 of them out at the same time, they become 4/2/6, which is good enough for 5 drop. If you get 3 of them out, it's 3 5/2/7 units and you have a very high chance of winning the game at that point. When it comes to shielding priority, you don't want them as your primary shields, but they are definately not as important as cannon automatons, at least not when on board alone. Try to protect them, if you have more of them in hand, protect them even more, but put them in front of your cannon automatons. This is one of the scrolls you will see in every energy deck. He's ranged. He's beefy. He can be buffed really well. It also is a scroll you don't want to sacrifice unless neccessary.

3x Thunder Surge

While people often say ""people at higher rankings don't clump up"", it's not true. They do. And you want to be able to punish them. Also just having thunder surge in deck gives fear to your opponent. He will not place his units as optimally as he would like to. He will be spread out everywhere, which hurts especially Order players. Abuse this, let them fear your mighty surge. And if they fuck up, punish them. This scroll is even better if you have destroyers in your deck, it will force your opponent into weird clumping. I don't use them though and it's still good. In terms of sacrificing, you have to count how many surges you have seen so far. It's most common to see your whole deck by round 20. If you have your 3rd surge in hand by round 15, you really don't want to sac it.

3x Burn

Again, one of the most crucial spells as energy. If you burn enemy units, he looses a card + board control and you get 1 card for free! If you want to kill beefy units, using spark+burn lets you essentially pay only 1 card, since it is mitigated by the scroll draw. It's not as optimal as burning 3hp unit, but it is less painful. I sacrifice burn only if I know my opponent is careful and trying to play around it (like playing only 4+ health units). It seems like I'm saying this about every card, but you don't really want to sac burn either.

3x Inferno Blast

Many people don't like IB, but it is very good. It's supergood against growth and Draw GO, since it helps you kill multiple vaetters/sisters/memorials. It is vry hard to play around IB since it's a large spell. It helps you finish units after they've been surged. It helps you surprise your opponent if your units are going to attack and they wouldn't have enough damage and it let's you weaken 4hp creatures to crucial 3hp burn. You don't want to play it just to play it without causing any deaths for your opponent, but if you have it in your deck, you'll find that draw very useful many times. Even damaging waking stones + weaking his units, there are soo many good things IB can do. You can sacrifice this scroll more often, I try not to sac it first few rounds against growth, so I have a way of killing his vaettrs and sisters of the fox (especially when he'll be hitting 4 resources for fertile soil).

3x Potion of Resistance

PoR is tricky scroll to use like every enchantment, it has quite a few counters. Be careful for pothers, it's often better to use PoR on your unit behind the wall than on the wall. Pushbacks are also very painful when you use PoR. When growth enemy isn't splashing pother, it's one of the best scrolls you can have, he has no other option that to go away or run his greatwolf to deal 1 damage. It's one of the scrolls I have problems using to the best, but it is still very good and should be in every energy deck. Sacrificing potion of resistance isn't as painful. Again I'd take care about how many do I have left in my deck, you don't want to sac your potions on round 1 5 7 and then be without it when you might need it. 

3x Copper Automaton

Copper Automatons are more about mindgames. They might force your opponent to do weird things, use scrolls he doesn't wan't to use etc. By putting automaton in front of his unit that is not attacking, you're pretty much saying ""your unit dies if you don't deal with it"". He is then forced to shield it with different unit he might have wanted to sacrificed, maybe playing haste units/blessings of haste he would have had better uses for. Also shielding your fragile unit with copper automaton when your opponent is about to attack (or has hasted units) might be sometimes good. It's 2hp, but still 1 round blocker, situational and sometimes good. There are few mistakes many people do though. First and the worst mistake is playing him on your first turn. Doing 4 damage to idol is meaningless, you don't want to do it. Ever. Second mistake is whip/copper automaton on strong 5hp units. Unless you are ahead in cards, you're just giving your opponent bigger card advantage (paying 2 for 1) for a small stalling. It might be good in few situations, but don't do it every time there's 5HP unit on board. Oh and of course, whip+copper on last standing 5hp idol is good. Win your games. You want to. Sacrificing-wise, I don't regret sacrificing copper automatons most of the time. You don't rely on him.

3x Spark

This is 1-1 card at best, but if you play without it, you're going to regret it. 2 damage will weaken your opponent many times so you can kill it. It is ""fuck you"" card for braves and crossbowmen and since it's 2cost spell, surge+spark is not as rare to finish off one of the units left standing. I mentioned above that spark+burn is sometimes very good etc. etc. Try to keep at least one in your hand early game, to counter braves etc., but you don't need to hold on to it. If you draw it, it's good. Sacrifing sparks isn't the worst decision. Of course, don't sacrifice if you know you might need it in next 3-5 turns.

3x Cannon Automaton

This is the SHIT. He deals 5 damage. That's instakill idol with CF. That's almost every unit dead on his hit. Even 6hp ones with whip. You wanna protect this guy. Put him in back. Don't loose him. He's going to wreck your opponent. I did the mistakes of trying to abuse his 1 armor and using him as shield, but it's just not worth it. Even the 1hp units you think he might shield and survive? Crimson bull in your face. Of course, if you want to protect your 2hp elder, put this guy in front, but don't risk him if you don't need to! His damage is too good!. You might be surprised, but I tend to sacrifice cannon automatons quite a lot. Of course early game, it's 6 cost unit, every 6 cost scrolls gets saced in your first hand, but even then. The thing is, he's not good at setting up board control all that much. If you pay 6 resoruces to get him out and it's one of your only units, he'll just die, your opponent will deal with him and you have a problem. But once you have that mortar up in front, just put him behind and watch your enemy run/attack in terror.

3x Violent Dispersal

MUST HAVE. you have NO other way of dealing with beefy units in back. That might be Vanguard, General, Jarl, Great Wolf, Knight Scholar... But even waking stones! It punishes enchantments, it helps mitigate board control of your enemy. Yes, you pay 6 for it, but it's better to pay 6 unit than to let your enemy summon mangy wolf/play speed next turn and wreck your face. Always try to have at least one in your hand.

3x Fury

This is one of the newest scrolls we are trying to play. Once you have board control and you don't run into bombards, this scroll just helps you deal with whatever next your opponent might have summoned. It let's you play copper automaton and explode him without whipping him and it's worth it if you have more units on the board and they can kill something too. While this card is very good at maintaining board control, you will probably regret using it if your enemy has a lot of shit on board himself. Fury also helps your pumps/libraries/whatever net that we will talk about soon. Sacrificing? You can, it's not AS valuable, especially when you don't ahve other shit on board. (I might be wrong with saccing this, I've played only 6 or so games with it - always think before saccing something. And not 1 turn ahead, but maybe even 3-4 turns ahead, this is not your guide that you can do every game.)

3x Ether Pump

Next of our newer additions. Don't hide these in back. They are your walls. Good walls. They will summon your enemy and he'll attack it with everything he has if it's about to hit. He doesn't want it out. He wants to get rid of it. And that means he's not hitting your units, so you have more space to hit with them, summon more of them. Oh and if it hits? it's free global inferno blast. And if you have 2 of them out and they both it? Oh man he just was thundersurged. You might want to use clock libraries (or destroyers) instead of this, it's up to your personal preference, but libraries will disappear eventually. Sacing this? Well, walls aren't what win you the game and mortars are cheaper, but you want to shield your units as energy. So don't just get rid of it without thinking.

3x Gun Automaton

Cheap early game 2 drop, able to tank some damage. You don't need to protect this guy, play him in front (but behind mortar/pump/other walls you have). He's good, but he doesn't deal as much damage. With 2 cost, you can play gunner and gun at same turn for 5 resources, providing cheap and potentionally attacking wall if you get something next in front. He also survives quakes! Oh and you can sacrifice him most of the time. Put him out on turn 2 to start getting some board control, but he's not as core.

3x Scattergunner

4/2/2 3 drop, sounds good doesn't it? Play him back, behind everything you have, sometimes even behind cannon automaton, but that depends on situation. His weakness is he just dies to quake. And to 2 ragged wolfs, 2 kabonks... He's very weak, but he can deal massive amounts of damage. Don't get too carried away with them. They are also great with bombard. You will get to 6 resources every game and if you can gunner bombard and the gunner will survive next turn, you just killed his annoying unburnable 4hp brother of the wolf or whatever else. You can also play him same turn as Hellspitter Mortar. I usually sac gunner if I already have one out and want to focus on something more beefy later. While he's good, his 2 hp have to be taken into account.

3x Hellspitter Mortar

Your best friend. 3cost 6hp wall that can sometimes make you dance. If he hits, you'll scream YEAAAAAAAAAAAH. Or at least I do. And if he doesn't? Well. It's a wall. It wasn't supposed to anyway. It's one of your best 3drops early game, because it creates a space in your mid lane to summon units behind (like that scattergunner). He can tank loaaaads of damage and with potion of resistance, watch him survive everything. Or get pothered. Pothered mortar is sad, but you have to take it into account. That might happen. You can sacrifice them if you have board control with different stuff, but if you don't? Then he'll give you space to set it up.

3x Iron Whip

SO MANY USES. 1hp ""spark"" for your enemy if that 1 is all he has left. -1 countdown if you need to. +1 damage if you need to. BOTH if you need to. You will almost always find a use for it. It's good. That said, you might sacrifice it unless you need it (which often you will). It's not as high priority as other spells, but keeping 1 in hand for that vaettr coming your way never hurts. Or your scattergunner gets to deal 5  damage and kill of his great wolf/vanguard! That works too. Even that gun automaton which suddenly kills 3hp units doesn't hurt. It just has so many uses!

2x Concentrate Fire

This is the only spell I'm using 2 of. It is kinda situational, sou you need it ""as often"". But since your units are ranged. And since attacking twice is good. And since you can combo it with bombard at 7 cost, it's worth having. This deck is range-centric. You want your range buff spell in it. When sacrificng, pay attention that you only have 2 of those in your deck. It's almost sure first round sacrifice, but later on you might find it veeeeery helpful.

3x Bombard

THE CORE. It only affects your units (and crossbowmen, maybe the other energy player you are ownling already). It makes EVERYTHING ATTACK (but the copper automaton, ehm), even the unit you summon that round! So that's 5 cost gun+bombard, 6 cost gunner+bombard, 8 cost elder+bombard and 9 cost cannon+bombard. Try not to sacrifice them without those you will have HUGE problems controling the enemy board and keeping his units low. The more shit you have on board. The better bombard gets. And it also affects your hellspitter mortars for ultimate awesome lucky hits. Every opponent facing energy fears this. It might come at any point. It's our rally. It's cheaper. It's center of this deck. It makes this deck awesome.

****

And that's it. This is my deck. This is the purpose my cards have in it. I find it VERY hard to cut any scroll from it, everything's really good. So while there are other also good scrolls in game, these works the best. If you want me to comment on scroll I'm not using and why I'm not using it, ask away in comments and try convince me why I should use it, so there's a good discussion around it.

edit: I have this deck called ""a bit more agressive"" in my decks, since it's a bit more agressive version to deck I used for very long time (uhm, 1 week?)

After switching fully I found that it was fairly easy to outplay people playing growth, but that building the deck and finding the correct build requires a lot of skill. I've been tuning my Growth deck to what I find on the ladder, as well as messing around with Energy a little bit, and I want to share my opinion once again on some core issues that I'm finding with the game since I feel that after last time the community has a better understanding of things within Scrolls.

I want to preface this text once again by saying that I am really enjoying this game a lot. The sudden releasing of new cards was a blast and the addition of the Scrolls Mod thingy was a wonderful addition to the game and shows that the staff behind scrolls are hard at work at creating a wonderful CCG experience. I appreciate that a lot.

I want to start by talking about a few game-play concepts that are very relevant to Scrolls, and go from there into things that I would like to see from the developers of the game. The following points are, from what I've observed in all of my games, the things that are most positively correlated with victory:

1) **Early Game Board Control**

This is simple. If you control the board and are able to stick quality units in the early game, you have a much greater chance of winning the game. The reason that this is the case right now is that there are no truly efficient board wipes as there are in Magic except for Quake, which oftentimes you need multiples of to clear a board. Against Order and Energy, an early lead will often lead to victory and against Growth, playing around Quake in addition to an early board lead will lead to victory a large percent of the time.

2) **Having a Backup Plan for Every Scenario**

ANY CARD CAN BECOME A RESOURCE OR MORE CARDS. This means that you have little to no excuse to run a solution to a problem card or a way of making your deck more resilient if there are things that you simply cannot beat as long as it is only 1 of another card. In addition, it can also be wise to run certain 1-ofs for certain scenarios since you can just turn the card into other things that you might need.

3) **Have a Curve That is Reliable** 

This wisdom comes from Magic: the Gathering. A ""curve"" refers to the amount of each card with a certain cost, laid out in order to create a curve. A good curve means that you have things to play on consecutive turns so that you continue to play powerful cards as soon as you have access to the resources for them, and this simple efficiency allows you to overwhelm the opponent without trying very hard. A bad curve leaves you with cards in your hand that you cannot cast until you are too far behind for it to matter.

4) **Control the Center**

Having units together (in most cases) allows you to have more powerful compositions and allows you to rearrange your units to best attack/defend from your opponent. If your opponent is split on the sidelines they do not have a choice in how they are attacking you or defending you. The only time this is not the case is against Thunder Surge but Energy never really has control of the board anyway so that's kind of a moot point.

5) **Having a Mid/Late Game Plan**

There are simply not enough scrolls and options to be only an early game deck, and the way that resources work ensures that you can keep late-game scrolls in your deck and cycle them early. You have to have this because the late game scrolls are a lot more powerful and you can almost always hit them by just producing resources every turn.

6) **Generating Card Advantage**

I just said that you need to hit your mid/late game cards by producing resources every turn, but the only way that you can do that is if you have more cards than your opponent and have the space in your game to, instead of drawing cards, pump cards into resources so that you can pump out powerful cards. This card advantage can be generated through killing opponent units, drawing extra cards, or through gaining extra resources through cards (since a resource normally requires a sacrifice of a card and your ""pitch-a-card"" play for the turn).

Now, keeping all of this in mind, I want to talk about healthy things that the designers of this game should, in my opinion, be thinking about, and to start a conversation with you all on this:

a) Right now, because of a lack of ways to reset a board state and a lack of efficient ways to produce resources, there is little to no incentive to be playing a deck that plays only to a late game. The GO-Draw deck that emerged for a little while when the Noaidi fiasco happened was given a tool to help it because it generated enough card advantage on its own. The deck was still insanely susceptible to early game draws and as such mostly preyed upon decks in the 1800 range. 

b) As its scarcity on the top of the ladder suggests as well as my personal experiences with it, Energy is not powerful enough to compete at a top level. The developers did a very good job at making the Energy style fun, and I still enjoy playing it. However, it has few good endgame units, and no ways to make those endgame units better. Growth and Order both have good ways of cooling down units, while Energy has no good ways to do that. Energy has no way to gain extra resources, and no way to draw cards. The only thing that Energy has is that they are able to be very aggressive, but have no way to follow it up, and then the developers decided to give Growth Quake, which destroys absolutely everything that Energy tries to do (3 damage to structures???!?!?!?!?). However:

c) Balance issues are not going to be fixed by releasing cards in small packets. Trying to fix ""the current op meta"" or whatever you want to call it is going to be fixed when an entire set is released. Right now, there are too many tools that are missing for decks to be variable enough, and there are too many staple cards missing from various factions to allow for certain strategies to be cohesive. Releasing single cards to fill in gaps is not the way to do this, as it just cements further the problems we have now. The tools we need to combat the top decks are not individual cards but new ideas and new ways to build our decks. 

d) On the overall subject of Balance, Order has a lot of tools but is missing a way to come back from being behind too much. Growth has just about everything they could ever wish for but their early game is actually surprising fragile without a Kinfolk Brave or a Vattr start.

e) The test server for new cards should be application based, not based upon being in Alpha. This would allow for a calculated mix of Scrolls players on all levels.

f) I was trying to look up lore for the different factions but I couldn't find any on the website. I know that in Magic the lore and the background behind what each of the different colors is trying to do steers heavily what the cards are capable of doing. I think that it would add a lot more depth to the game if the different factions were more outlined by their goals as a faction.

g) The community is doing an incredible job of doing lots of streaming, creating video content, running tournaments, and overall being very friendly. I really appreciate you all doing what you're doing and want to encourage you guys to keep it up! (I'm gonna get in on some tournament shenanigans!!) I would love to start some sort of State of the Scrolls things at some point.

Thanks a lot for reading and please feel free to leave feedback, agree or disagree with points, or start a friendly debate about things. See you online!

Only way to beat this deck is by racing (at least for me as energy). So If I don't get good racing cards and don't win before turn 12, I loose. I felt from rank 18 to rank 93 and besides 2 order players who beat me, it was all Draw GO. It is not fun to play against, it completely breaks the game and EVERYONE is playing it.

How to hotfix it you ask? Easy, punish player for going through his deck 2nd and 3rd time more and more and more. This is bullshit.

1371720469.0,53,self.Scrolls,1gpuyv,"Mojang, we need to talk about Noaidi.",85,32,74,http://www.reddit.com/r/Scrolls/comments/1gpuyv/mojang_we_need_to_talk_about_noaidi/,"I guess there's a lot to say about it, but let's not bury the lead: It's broken as fuck. There's no other way to put it, it's by far the best card in the game and there's no counterplay for it.

I'll try my best to explain why I think so. Sacrificing cards for resources is the fundamental restricting rule in the game. You can only do it once per turn. Normally early on in the game, you discard 1 card to add 1 resource. *Alternatively* you could discard 1 card to draw 2 cards. So gaining one resource is equivalent or *better* than drawing 2 cards early and it's equivalent or worse than drawing 2 cards late game.

For simplicity's sake, we're going to say that gaining 1 resource is equivalent to drawing 2 cards. Again, it's better than that early, and slightly worse than that late. If everyone is with me, let's continue.

Noaidi is a 3/2/2 creature. When you play it, *you* gain resources of every type your opponent has. It's easiest to analyze how strong it is if he's running mono-Growth. You obviously get exactly the resource you want, so it's absolutely disgusting against Growth. You just drew 3 cards for 3 mana, *AND* you got to put one of them into play as a 3/2/2 for free.

I can only compare it to Sister of the Fox, which is a very good card. It's a staple of every Growth deck and every Growth player will tell you Sister is far off the chopping block. 2 mana, you draw *one* card. With Noaidi, you pay 1 more resource, you draw +1 card, and it has +2/+1. Wut?

Ok, so you probably agree that the Growth mirror is pretty stupid with Noaidi. You have no control over whether you get it or not, and it's worth 3 cards. If you don't draw one (or if your opponent gets 2, you only get 1), you have to play yourself out of a 3-card hole in a situation where your opponent has access to more cards and more resources than you do and where he got to use his turn 3 drop (a turn you probably passed on). It's possible, but you would need to outplay the shit out of your opponent.

But you're thinking what if you just refuse to play Growth, then Noaidi is just a 3/2/2 for 3, which is pretty weak, right?

The problem is that the Growth player can splash to abuse Noaidi even more. Normally, it's very costly to splash because any time you want an off-resource, you have to sacrifice two cards just to get the resources necessary to play a 1cc spell in an off-color. If you're a Growth player and you want to be able to play Pother, then you have to give up 2 cards just to have the right to cast it.

It sounds like an overwhelming drawback, but Growth with Order splash was one of the best decks in the format (before Noaidi got printed). I don't know if Manchy invented the Order splash or not (I think he did), but he certainly piloted it very well, up to over 2000 Elo and second place on the ladder. The reason for the Order splash is that Pother is an amazing card for Growth to have access to, a card that's worth discarding 2 cards just to play. Among other things, it's an answer to Waking Stone and Potion of Resistance. Even the threat of the Order splash makes Waking Stone an unreliable card. Transposition is also in the splash and is extremely powerful.

I can testify that it's a good deck. I piloted Growth/Order Aggro to over 1900 (copied Manchy's build card for card, heh), and while he's a better player than I am, it was a great deck (best in the format, I think, hence why I switched to play it).

Now it's running Noaidi. If you're playing against Order, you play Order cards for free, without having to sacrifice any cards. Again, it's a 3 drop that gives you +2 card *advantage* in that matchup. That wrecks the balance of the game. Imagine you're an Order player. Just because his color has Naoidi, now he gets to play all of your color's cards for free? It doesn't even cost him any mana, because he got that mana for free with his 3/2/2 drop.

So there's only one matchup where Noaidi isn't broken sideways, and it's the monoEnergy matchup. Frankly, there aren't enough Energy players near the top for me to really be able to tell you good information about how the matchups are, but from what I hear and what I've seen, Energy has a lot of trouble with Growth, it's certainly not going to be the counter to keep Growth in check.

Of course, if your opponent is running Growth *and* Order, then Noaidi becomes even stronger. It becomes a draw 5 that also lets you put a creature from your hand into play. One card, you get a 3/2/2, *and* you save yourself from having to discard 4 cards. Absolutely disgusting. Imperial Resources is *worse* than that and Imperial Resources costs 7.

If you both happen to be running all 3 colors, and so is your opponent, then it's a draw 7. I'm running out of colorful ways to illustrate how good that is. It's like a respawning indestructible black lotus that also attacks.

TL;DR Noaidi is a 3 mana 3/2/2 that lets you draw 2 cards when you play it. Sometimes it even lets you draw 4 cards.

It doesn't seem to create any huge issues, but I can't help but wonder if it's one of the reasons we see so many extremely late game draw-heavy decks, especially at higher rankings.  Obviously card draw will always be powerful in a game like this, but the inclusion of a maximum hand size might keep it a little more in check.  It might also add some additional strategy to cards like Pushback, where you could prevent your opponent from drawing a card on their turn if you fill up their hand.

Anyways, just wondering what everyone's thoughts on this was.  Haven't seen much discussion about it.  Should there be a maximum hand size?  If so, what should it be?  If not, why not?

My suggestion: For your first win, which resets every 22 hours, you get an extra 100 - 200 gold. It encourages people to keep playing even after getting a losing streak and gives people another reason to login to play. Plus, it makes that first win all the sweeter.

1371989540.0,47,self.Scrolls,1gwlqj,Reddit Scrolls Survey - the results,52,5,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/Scrolls/comments/1gwlqj/reddit_scrolls_survey_the_results/,"Yesterday, I posted a link to a survey I designed with the intention of finding out a bit more about the community here it /r/scrolls - however, I didn't anticipate the interest that it received, and due to Surveymonkey not allowing an unpaid user to view more than 100 responses, that is what these results will have to be based off. I hope to do a similar survey again in a couple of weeks and use a tool such as Google Office, where these restrictions aren't in place.

Anyway, on to the results!!!


**Question 1: When did you start playing Scrolls?**

Somewhat unsurprisingly, the vast majority of Redditors bought the game during Beta, with just 3 Alpha users and one non-Scrolls player answering the survey. Of the 96 who bought the game during Beta, 31 of them did so on the very first day, indicating that they had been anticipating the games release.


**Question 2: What is your current Scrolls rating?**

24% of players have never played (or at least, won) a ranked match, with a further 27% lying between 1 and 1500. This suggests that the remaining 49% are highly active in ranked gameplay, with the most clustered bracket being 1601-1700, where 17% of players claim to be ranked, as well as 11% who lie in the 1701-1800 range. 3 players lay in each of the upper limits; 1801-1900, 1901-2000, and 2001+, however, there is no way of telling whether these players were telling the truth or not, seeing as only around 10 Scrolls players actually have ratings over 2001.


**Question 3: Which resource type is your favourite?**

The most staggering level of support lay with Order, which 44% of players claimed to be their favourite. This figure dropped to 34%, roughly one third, for Growth, and just 22% for Energy, implying that Energy is the least favoured of the three resource types at the moment.


**Question 4: What type of deck do you play with primarily?**

75% of players that responded to the survey play primarily with mono decks, which largely correspond to their favourite resource type, with mono Order having 36 votes, mono Growth with 21 and mono Energy with 18. As far as mixed decks go, Growth/Order is the most popular, with 12 votes, while Order/Energy and Growth/Energy have 6 and 7 respectively.


**Question 5: What is your favourite scroll in the game?**

Luckily, due to it requiring text answers, I managed to see all responses to this question, meaning lots to sort through! In the end, 3 scrolls tied for first place, one from each deck. Honorable General, Burn, and Kinfolk Veteran each received 7 votes. Other mentions should go to God Hand which received 6 votes, and Speed, Focus, Great Wolf, Cannon Automaton, Kinfolk Brave and Imperial Resources, which each received 5 votes. There was also a lot of love for Orders skirmishers, with a combined 7 votes for the Ducal and Royal counterparts.


**Question 6: How do you spend most of your time in-game?**

73% of players spend most of their Scrolls time playing some form of online matches, with just over half of them preferring ranked to quick matches. Aside from that, 14% spend their time playing the AI, 6% trading, and 2% building decks. The remaining 5% prefer the social side of Scrolls, either challenging friends or hanging out in chatrooms.


**Question 7: Do you have any past experience with CCGs?**

32% of Redditors have no past experience with this genre of game, and of the 68 who do have experience, just 8 have experience playing CCGs to a high level.


**Question 8: How did you first hear about Scrolls?**

37% of players heard about Scrolls through following Mojang, which is probably how so many have no CCG experience under their belts, including myself. 22% heard through social media, 9% through real-life friends, 3% through another CCG, and 13% through internet advertising. Also though, 20% of players first heard about Scrolls through YouTube, an option I stupidly forgot to include in the main selection bar, so the number is likely to be higher. Furthermore, the majority of those who came from YouTube were sent by TotalBiscuit's WTF video on the game. Twitch and Reddit are both other sites that first introduced players to the game

Before the match starts, both players would have the opportunity to offer cards, money or a combination of the two into a prize pool, where the winner takes everything. The trading screen GUI could be used to minimise development work. (Alternatively, this mode could replace challenge modes, as people would be still be able to accept a match if neither player offers anything, just as a trade where neither player actually puts anything up can go through.) I think a mode like this is quite important, as currently, people have to put trust into their opponent or a duel mediator in order to battle each other for a reward. This prevents the possibility of scamming or dishonest practices from all parties.

Especially Bunnies and End of Reason.

Hopefully Atmaz doesn't mind me linking this, but I just watched the video for the first time and I couldn't stop laughing at the ridiculousness, even though I played in the game.

**Morre's Job**

&gt;Trauc: Morre, what is your position? mod? or something else..

&gt;Morre: i'm a programmer

**Testing**

&gt;Rubber_Duck: Morre do you have a Test team or is that everyones job?

&gt;Morre: we don't

&gt;Morre: we mostly test as we implement stuff

**Growth Balance**
&gt;Blinky: What I will say on the current balance of things is that the fact that it would seem that about 90% of people are playing Growth makes it seem like it is OP. It isn't OP however it is definetly the strongest.

&gt;Morre: blinky, it's a self-fulfilling prophecy a bit as well

&gt;Morre: like, most people picked the growth precon

&gt;Morre: so most people play it and learn it

&gt;Morre: and then people see others playing growth thinking, this must be the best

&gt;Morre: and so on so forth

**Card Text Clarifications**
&gt;Strill: Speaking of bugs, there's a bug where that dust guy's insta-death doesn't work if he only deals 0 damage to the target

&gt;Strill: also Blast Strike doesn't spread his effect

&gt;Morre: strill, that's not a bug

&gt;Morre: that's intentional

&gt;Strill: other cards like Blood Boil and Spiky DO take effect when things deal 0 damage

&gt;Morre: strill, yeah, I know

&gt;Morre: blood boil and vengeance veil should possibly be changed

&gt;Morre: we'll make it more consistent eventually

&gt;TheDigitalChao: wai twait wait

&gt;TheDigitalChao: blood boil?!

&gt;TheDigitalChao: but i use it well in my wildling.

&gt;Morre: we're not going to change how it works

&gt;Morre: i just meant we'll change either dust runner or blood boil for consistency in ""deals damage"" interpretation

**New Order Spells**

&gt;Morre: there's a new order spell in the design documents that I think you'll like though...

&gt;Blinky: yay

&gt;Blinky: gimme

&gt;Morre: I haven't implemented and tested it yet

&gt;Morre: but man, I think it'll be powerful

&gt;Morre: not sure how to cost it yet :)

&gt;Blinky: does it say ""Iff opponent has a growth resource they lose the game and are not allowed to play a growth deck ever again""?

&gt;Morre: ...it's a very ordery thing

&gt;Morre: like, the things they usually do

&gt;Blinky: oooooooo

&gt;Morre: just cool

&gt;Rky: target unit gains 9000 attack until end of turn

&gt;Morre: 9001*

&gt;Strill: Morre: Then is it, All your units gain Spiky 2?

&gt;Morre: Strill no, but something along those lines has been discussed for another spell

**Noaidi Flavour Text**

&gt;Strill: Morre, what's up with that Moose migration thing? Iv'e been racking my brain trying to figure out if that's a joke or not because moose don't migrate

&gt;Morre: strill ;)

&gt;Morre: maybe they do in scrolls

&gt;Morre: it's an inside joke of a sort

**Plate Armor Balance**

&gt;TheDigitalChao: Plate Armor all combat damage reduced by 1!

&gt;TheDigitalChao: turn it to ALL DAMAGE

&gt;Morre: TheDigitalChao: it was that way for a while

&gt;Morre: it was completely OP

**Probability: Scroll Packs vs Singles**

&gt;Zougkla: I just bought 15 single scrolls, and im pretty sure the rarity breakdown is the same as the packs, so there isn't much difference I guess

&gt;Morre: zoug, it is

&gt;Morre: random scrolls gets you 70%, 20%, 10% c/u/r

&gt;Morre: packs give you 7/2/1

**Scrolls Economy**

&gt;Strill: Morre, are you concerned about a saturated market? Shouldn't you have scroll sinks to prevent old cards from piling up and becoming worthless as people buy scroll packs fishing for the new cards?

&gt;Morre: yeah

&gt;Morre: we're working on sinks

&gt;Morre: primary concern right now

&gt;Morre: at least one sink

&gt;Morre: we didn't have time to finish it for the beta, but it's in the pipeline

**Win Rate Statistics**

&gt;Zrave: Morre I'm sure you have the actual win rates? :P

&gt;Morre: zrave, I've asked patrick to dig them up

&gt;Morre: but I really don't

&gt;Morre: because it's *a lot* of data that's not too easily processed

**Beta Length**

&gt;Luca: Morre how long will beta last

&gt;Morre: luca, who knows

**Rank 1 Player Zrave on Imperial Resources Balance**

&gt;Zrave: I think imperial resources is fine where it is, I play against it all the time vs the top order decks, and often I'm hoping they don't draw it :P

**Gravelock Elder**

&gt;Lupus: Draforce: you feel irresistable desire to buy a Gravelock Elder from me

&gt;Lupus: It calls to you... It's lying on the bed... naked... waiting for you.

**TheDigitalChao's Toilet**
&gt;TheDigitalChao: okay thats messed up

&gt;TheDigitalChao: there are spiders breeding in my toilet

&gt;TheDigitalChao: that is seriously messed up

After the chat session Morre agreed to play a match with me! He was really funny and cracked jokes throughout the match, for example, summoning a 3-attack ragged wolf in front of my crossbowman only to pull it back towards my Waking Stones and call out ""psyche!"". I'm currently rated 1827 and he wiped the floor in less than 15 turns without even needing to spend more than 10 seconds on any given turn!  That should give you an idea of how good Morre is at the game.

So I guess I'm not someone who is so easily bored if there is not new content being released constantly. The art is beautiful, the gameplay is unique and interesting- Scrolls is a historic game just in the state that it is now even if it was never updated again.

First thing you have to understand when playing a competitive card game: there is no deck that could guarantee you 100% win rate. Loses happen depends on luck of the draw even if you play the game perfectly. Game balance design can only minimize the luck factor but the card game nature will always maintain the fortune's impact.

So instead, strives for a better execution and decision making skill. What decide whether you are good at the game or not is not based on one ore two wins but your long term result.

1373216825.0,39,self.Scrolls,1ht5bb,So why are you not in the auction chatroom right now?,59,20,39,http://www.reddit.com/r/Scrolls/comments/1ht5bb/so_why_are_you_not_in_the_auction_chatroom_right/,"This post is just to make some people aware of the auction chatroom. From some other posts I saw that people really wanted an auction system, and now there is a system but people do not seem to use it a lot. 

The auction chatroom doesnt require any mods and it works great. I will just quickly explain how it works. You start by joining the chatroom: ""auction"". Every few minutes a new auction starts. The bot will pick a card from his inventory, you can also request cards to be auctioned. The starting prices are mostly lower than ScrollsPC prices. You and others can now start to bid. When the time runs out (The exact amount of time depends on the amount of bids) the highest bidder gets invited trade by the AuctionBot and after 20s a new auction starts. The Bot will auto buy new scrolls with the money it got.

These are the commands:

* !bid GOLD - Just the command to bid on the current scroll. GOLD is th e amount of gold that you want to bid
* !request SCROLL  - The command to request a scroll for the next auction. SCROLL is the name of the scroll you want to see.
* !announce - To see info on the current auction (Card, highest bid, etc)
* !help - This gives you all the commands

Some other notifications:
* I did not write the bot, Detour_ did
* All of the money made goes back to selling new cards for the stock 
* If you decline the trade or take to long to accept you will be banned for one hour (This is to prevent trolls bidding and not making the trade)

I hope this post gets more people in the room because right now its just a way of getting cards cheap instead of an actual auction. You can ask any questions here or in the auction chat room.

Well, before it kicked off, several of us chatted with some devs in the comfortable confines of General-1. We were able to learn a few tidbits about possible upcoming mechanics.

Sadly, I forgot to screencap the chat, but others in the conversation could support the following:

- I asked Morre about X spells (similar to Magic, such as Fireball, etc.), where you could sink X resources into them for a bigger effect, and he said that they are interested in doing them, and their implementation has been discussed.

- We also inquired about the possibility of 'World Enchantments' - a spell or unit that would affect the way the game was played (think of the conditions in Trials), such as ""All creatures have haste."" We were told that something like that is in development, but we were told that ""they may not affect both players, but they could!""

- Lastly, we inquired about colourless spells. And we were given a ""Kinda."" They went on to elaborate that the cards themselves wouldn't be strictly colourless, but they are working on something that will make some spells easier to cast in multiple colours. They said that they didn't want to discuss it too much because it's not in testing yet.

That's it. If you learned anything else while playing today, please share!


UPDATE #1:

- Morre has said that the next big features we'll likely be seeing are Spectator Mode and a Limited (Sealed, Draft) Mode. Campaign will likely come after those.

UPDATE #2:

- The devs have confirmed that more Trials are on the way, and that Decay will have their own Trials.

UPDATE #3: 

- ""Scrolls will have Oculus Rift Support, but only in the Trade Window."" ;)

UPDATE #4:

- A small chatroom contest was held to determine the flavour text for Regeniture, the Decay card. User Blooperly won with ""Sometimes you can get blood from a stone.""

1376067651.0,36,self.Scrolls,1k1aml,What Energy needs and the inherent problem of pump creatures/structures compared to straight draw,46,10,55,http://www.reddit.com/r/Scrolls/comments/1k1aml/what_energy_needs_and_the_inherent_problem_of/,"So, some people know me, some might not. I'm Sho7gun, one of the many scrolls streamers, and I play energy since the start. My rating atm is like 1890 or something, and once I managed to get to the top 30 with energy and I strave nowadays between 1850 and 1950. So I'm not the best energy player, but I have my experience and would say know how to play the faction to a decent extent.

So why do I make this post? Because energy is still falling behind the other factions. Against growth, we have to be quite lucky with the draws. Against order, there's only really one decktype we can play (midgame agression) and have to race them to win (because of imperial resources). I did make the 'how to beat order as energy' post and I still think order isn't as hard as a lot of people think as energy, but it's still quite hard. My winrate did drop to around 60% from 80 against order (people learned better how to play them and play better against energy) So something needs to be done and I'm going to speculate here what can help energy and what the problem is right now.

So the most obvious problem energy has is that it doesn't have card draw. Now Mojang stated that they will never give energy card draw but give it stuff in which we can spend resources so we can save cards. This system is good, and it helps, but there are three inherent problems. That's because it doesn't draw you cards, it makes it so you don't have to play cards. 

1. It doesn't cycle your deck. Now some might not agree, dunno, but I find cycling to be pretty relevant in a game where the library doesn't run out. Why? Well, because you'll be sure to draw the cards you need more often. With cycling, if you play a card, you'll see that card back faster than when you wouldn't cycle. You would also get to the cards you need faster. This means that Energy needs to spend their cards far more wisely and make better trades, which also means there's less room for mistakes than with the other factions. Plus, you have to pray more to get that one card you need for this situation.

2. It doesn't give you more options. When you straight up draw, you get more options in your hand instantly. With energy, you need to hold your cards to create more options. 

3. Energy can't splash well. Because we have to be more conservative with the cards and don't have another way to build up resources. Sure, you can use 'efficiency', but in order for that spell to be worth it, you need to cast it twice, because you need to discard for order to be able to play it. Take into account that you have to be more conservative with your cards, splashing is a big risk. 

So what I'm trying to say really, is that energy has more rng problems than the other factions, which is always bad in a card game, as you always want to lessen the rng effect (reason why people only make decks that holds the minimum amount of cards and tries to make as few 2 and 1 offs as possible)

So how can we make sure to combat these problems. Well, one thing is obvious, giving us more draw. An example would be to change clock library into where we can spend resources to draw a card from it. But that would probably be to strong, and as we won't get cards that draw us cards, that solution is out of the question. Another way is to give us a card that builds up energy and isn't a different faction card. What card that should be, well, I'm not good at creating cards, so I'm not gonna bother, but I bet there is a good way. If we get something like this, we don't have to discard as much cards to get energy, so we can discard more for draw instead of resources, and we can draw a tiny bit more and thus cycle more and lessen the rng effect, making energy far more reliable to play.

On a whole different note, I saw someone post an energy card he made that's like summons and eye of the eagle where you would draw a spell, and that card made so much sense, it should be in the game (so description would be: 1E = Take the next spell scroll from your library with a different name as this scroll and add it to your hand) Would also help with the cycling and energy reliability. 


There are a few other problems energy has (like it can only really run a midgame agression deck), but solving this problem would go a long way into making energy fit into the meta. Pumping creatures/structures is a step in the right direction, but with the inherent problem it isn't the only step Mojang needs to make to fix energy. 

And again, this is how I see it. Please discuss and tell me what you think energy needs, but keep it civil and don't downvote responses just because you don't agree with them. Only downvote troll attempts or blatent spam that doesn't add anything to the discussion in any way.

For example, I had a game just the other day where my starting hand consisted of 5 spells/enchantments, and I did not draw a creature for 2 turns.  This subsequently led to me losing all board control throughout mid game, and was the primary reason for my loss that game.  (PS the deck was sound, and works fine most of the time, this was just a bad draw).  I think that the option to mulligan your starting hand once could make the game a lot more skill-balanced, and make the first few turns a lot less luck-based.  This has probably been proposed before, but does anyone else agree with me here?

*I started to play this game three weeks ago and wanted to share many useful 
things with you :)*

---

1)  If you have a lot of Gold and plan to buy many Scroll Packs you can simply buy a pack, then click on ""Settings"" and afterwards on ""Store"".  You save some seconds, because otherwise you would need to check all 10 cards before buying a new pack.

2)  I suggest to sell old Commons, which u have more than 3x, to the NPC for 25 Gold each, because it's not worth the time to find a buyer for these. (When buying a Scroll Pack you will get 7 Commons that you can resell afterwards for 175 Gold, so you only spent 825 Gold for 2 Uncommons and 1 Rare!) But new Commons are worth selling:

* Currently: Dust Runner, Faith Duty, Stag Heart (200-300 Gold each)

3)  These Uncommons are also not worth the time selling in trading rooms (at least in my opinion):

* Blind Rage, Concentrate Fire, Dryadic Power, Ember Bonds, Faith Blessing, Frost Wind, Fury, Leeching Ring, Machination Mindset, Magma Pack, Metempsychosis, Nutrition, Overdrive, Ranger's Bane, Redesign, Royal Spearman, Scattergunner, Sinmarked Zealot, Vaettr of the Wild

They are only worth around 100 - 150 Gold each (the NPC gives instantly 50 Gold). But if you are really low on Gold you could try to make some profit from them aswell.

4)  Same thing with Rares, which are only worth 150-200 Gold each! These Rares should be sold to the NPC for 100 Gold for saving time: 

* Essence Feast, Plate Armor, Roasted Bean Potion

5)  You can be in more than one trading room (trading-1, trading-2, trading-3 ...). But if you send more than 6 copy-paste messages in a short time you will be temporarily muted for some seconds (like 15). Advice: Copy-paste your trading message in six different rooms, then wait 10 seconds and paste it in the other rooms.

---

6)  [https://account.mojang.com/stats/3](https://account.mojang.com/stats/3) This website shows how many copies of Scrolls were already sold (as far as i know).

7)  Don't worry about starting to play Ranked Matches! Ranked points won't decrease until you reach a certain amount of them. I'm not sure here, but something like 1200-1300 points.

8)  The scrolls from the PreCon Decks are worth (Commons valued 25 Gold each):

* Growth: 6000-6250 Gold
* Order: 5250-5500 Gold
* Energy: 5000-5250 Gold

Advice for new players: Start with the Order or the Energy Deck, because the 50 scrolls from your first PreCon Decks can't be traded/sold! As a next step you could buy the Growth PreCon Deck for 6500 Gold.

9)  Memorials are almost core scrolls for multicolor decks, because they provide one extra resource for free and can protect your idol.

10)  The easy Trials can be won fast and are a great opportunity for getting some Gold! Care: A surrender against bots will be shown in your profile!

---

11)  When building a deck remember to select only 50 scrolls, because the chance of drawing something important will increase!

12)  The game currently has no graveyard (scrolls will be shuffled back into your deck after you draw all), so the only way to win is destroying three idols of the enemy (unless he surrenders before this happens).

13)  If you play multicolored decks: Don't forget you can sacrifice for example a Growth scroll for a Order or Energy ressource.

14)  The ""Just For You"" cards in the Store are almost always too expensive! Currently only some are worth it:

* Uncommons (cost 500): Heritage (keep or sell for 600), Pother (keep or sell for 700-800)

* Rares (cost 1000): Automata Forge (keep or sell for 2000), Fertile Soil (keep or sell for 1100-1200), Kinfolk Brave (keep or sell for 1100), Potion of Resistance (keep), Speed (keep or sell for 1100), Thunder Surge (keep), Violent Dispersal (keep)

15)  It is possible to turn off/on challenge and trade invites (look to the right of the ""Send"" button).

---

16)  At the moment whispering is not implemented.

17)  If you are wondering how people make strange symbols in the trading rooms: [http://fsymbols.com/all/](http://fsymbols.com/all/) (Just copy-paste the symbols you want into your trading message)

18)  There is a way of taking screenshots: Go to ""Settings"" ingame and remove the tick mark from ""full screen"". Then just press the button for printing your screen and paste it in Paint.

19)  You can make the chat window a lot bigger by dragging the top line of it.

20)  Removing the annoying chat sounds (when someone sends a message) is possible: Go to ""Settings"" ingame and remove the tick mark from ""chat message sound"".

---

21)  You can add more than one scroll at once to your deck by holding left-click and then dragging it like usually.

22)  Play at least three decks (Mono Growth, Mono Order, Mono Energy) for understanding their strengths and weaknesses!

23)  Get board control by killing the enemy's creatures instead of damaging his/her idols unless you could end the game.

24)  Sacrifice early for ressources until you have 4-6 and then start to sacrifice for scrolls (but don't forget to get more ressources when the game progresses).

25)  Random scrolls for 100 Gold have a chance of 70% being a Common, 20% a Uncommon and 10% a Rare. In the long run you will have the same amount of Commons / Uncommons / Rares by purchasing random scrolls instead of Scroll Packs.

---

26) Some popular rooms are currently:

*  reddit, dappertime, wtb, auction, pricecheck (write "".p scroll name"" in this room and get a price check) Protip: Try "".p love"" there!

27) At the moment 141 scrolls exist:

* 64 Commons / 47 Uncommons / 30 Rares (If you want to have three of each scroll: 423)

28) Keep in mind that your opponent can have scrolls on the board/hand that speed up creatures:

* Blessing of Haste, Bombard, Death Cap Berserk, Fury, God Hand, Honorable General, Iron Whip, Mangonel, Mangy Wolf, Rallying, Speed (every type of ressource can speed up their creatures!)

29) Get ""Summoner: Scrolls Modloader"" here: [http://www.scrollsguide.com/summoner](http://www.scrollsguide.com/summoner). With the available Mods you can have special functions like:

* Muting people, having replays of played games, saving favorite rooms, seeing colors in trading rooms &amp; more

30) You can filter your collection in the Deck Builder by typing this in the bottom left corner:

* (Rarity) r:common , r:uncommon , r:rare
* (Description) d:relentless , d:haste , d:draw , d:countdown , d:increase , d:decrease , d:destroy &amp; more
* (Type) t:creature , t:enchantment , t:spell , t:structure

I want to offer some serious thoughts about the future of Scrolls and as a guy who sacrificed his holidays for scrolls ( 2 months ) with an average of 5 hours each day I feel my opinion is at least something worth.

* Decay : 

Decay is probably coming out next week, we are going to have a lot of old players coming back to test the new resource. Some players are able to buy all cards in one hit, e.g in trading channel or just buy tons of 175g decay cards in the store. We are going to have 2 weeks a great beta server with people who wants to play with decay. After these 2 weeks everything is in the same state as now, everyone tested decay some people may stay on the game but mostly everyone already left again. Why is that ? It's still the same game we just changed the meta a bit, added some new cards. Mojang could add like 1000 cards in one hit it wouldn't change anything because it's still the same set up. You can satisfy some people for a short time with that, but you don't keep them in the long run.

* Trading / Cards / Gold : 

New players feel like it takes to long to get new cards, well old players have all cards already I even met some people with almost every T3-Shiny card. Besides the fun the only goal you have after the game is to get a new card with your recently earned gold. Some people here on reddit suggested to make the ""Double gold monday"" the standard value, well every new player is going to have all cards after 2 days since we have a huge inflation. A lot of people don't get the most important thing, we print infinite cards and gold, but we can't print infinite new player sign ups. So we already getting to a point where Scrolls is not generating enough sign ups to maintain a healthy economy, if we raise the gold earning value, the inflation is coming even faster and there is no point at all to play scrolls except the obvious reason the FUN ( the reason why you play a game in the first place ), but it's not enough today.

* Crafting :

Crafting is a nice gold-sink if you already have tons of cards but the shiny effect is not enough. People need to recognize the value of a x9 crafted card, e.g shiny effect on the field. Mojang need to appreciate every player who spent his hard earned gold into crafting, it's not enough to show a shiny border.

* Custom games :

Warcraft III is world wide the biggest game which is mostly based on custom games. Besides the real game people like to customize the game. Allow people to start a game with different values, Player 1 starts with just 1 idol, Player 2 get +2 attack on all rats. I don't know where we can get there but I have a lot of ideas in my mind when it comes to this customize thing. With all these mod developer / mapper / designer in this community we could create something really big here. Just imagine different maps or even own cards ( cards you just created ) in a custom game.

* Draft : 

A simple one click draft solution in the client. People love draft, you guys underestimate the value of people just interested in a draft feature but doesn't care about all the other features. I believe 20% of all scrolls player would be online just to play draft. And this is a feature for the long run, it provides fun all the time.

* Tournament system :

This is a nice feature to keep a lot of people interested. It's not important right now but it's a good thing for the future.

* Challenges :

Allow BO3 + BO5 challenges. Why not giving the option to challenge people for a value of gold and the winner gets 95% of the money, this way we get a huge thrill factor on challenges including a little gold sink. I would use this feature every day.

* Ranked system :

Add point decay for people who not playing at least one game every third day. Set up a real Elo system like chess. The system right now is far behind of any standard. After all changes set a date for a ladder reset so everyone is getting a new chance to achieve a higher rank. 

* Progress / Updates :

People need to see progress, release 3 new cards every week, give us some progress so everyone knows this game is alive.

The game has already sold at a profit, and it has only been out a week. So obviously we are going to see additions to the game. What are you ideas? Il list mine below.

*  **more resources:** this one is pretty obvious. as the game progresses, more resources will likely appear. With this, more cards, and more combination opportunities.

* **more cards:** again, pretty obvious. As more cards come out, more unique decks will start showing up. Like Magic, certain cards can be used to build a deck around. I had a black deck which was based off 4 of the same card that had strength and toughness based on the amount of lands you have, then just built it off that. I imagain scrolls can eventually work the same way. 

* **friends list:** Having to create a new room for you and your friend is a small pain, and a friends list would work well. Being able to add people who you just played with as well. (or atleast allow me to talk after the game is done)

* **guild/clan/:** The interface in the game gives me a warcraft 3 vibe. Id like to see clans in a similar way. 

* **more game types:** Challenges are great, but what I mean is varied ways of playing. 2 v 2s or 3 v 3's are very doable in TCG's.

I wanted to follow up on the math that mechtech did in [a previous post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Scrolls/comments/1fujiv/newbie_question_how_do_i_spend_the_2k_gold_from/cadzg58) with some hard numbers, so I made a spreadsheet with the prices from ScrollsPC, except for the 3 new cards which I had to get from ScrollsPost.com. I also used the dev confirmed distribution of 70%-20%-10% for 'c'/'u'/'r' rarity in all packs in my calculations. This is what I came up with:

edit 3: Thanks to fr0d0b0ls0n for [pointing out a major error in the calculations](http://www.reddit.com/r/Scrolls/comments/1hps38/some_math_on_how_to_buy_cards/cawvq8b). The below table has been revised.

**Pack Type** | **Expected *Profit* Per 1g Spent** 
 :---|:--: 
Random 10-Pack | 0.53g
Random Scroll | 0.53g
Random Energy Scroll | ~~0.59g~~ -0.16g
Random Growth Scroll | ~~0.54g~~ -0.21g
Random Order Scroll | ~~0.48g~~ -0.27g



So, if you're going for pure profit on the market (person to person trading), ~~anything you buy in the shop~~ random packs will get you around 50%+ in profit on your initial spend. ~~At the moment, Energy seems to be the most valuable, mostly because Automata Forge is at ridiculous prices.~~ If you're looking for a specific set of cards, deciding what to buy is more complicated, and will be the topic of the rest of this post. 

------------------------

Here's a rule you can follow to decide whether to buy the rest of your scrolls from the market or the shop:

&gt;**You should buy the pack type in the store that will result in the *lowest total cost of packs* after buying the expected number of packs it would take to get *one* scroll from your wantlist, but only if that cost is lower than the *market price of the cheapest scroll* in your wantlist.**

Whew, that's a mouthful. The basic idea is that if you can expect to get a card from your wantlist in the store for less than the market price of the cheapest card in that list, you should buy from the store. Otherwise, go buy the cheapest card on your list, then reevaluate according to the rule above.

This means that any card that costs less than 100g should be bought on the market if you're willing to take the time to do so. If you're only concerned with one faction, you should buy all scrolls in your faction that cost less than 175g on the market as well. Everything else will take a little bit of math. (There are some examples below)

If you don't want to be bothered with selling any scrolls you happen to get that aren't on your wantlist, then the above rule works out. However, you can get a much better deal if you're willing to get on the trading channels, so let's revise that rule a bit to account to profit from trading:

&gt;**You should buy the pack type in the store that will result in the *lowest net cost* after buying the expected number of packs to get *one* card from your wantlist and then selling any cards not on your wantlist.**

Let's move on to an example where our wantlist only has 1 scroll.

------------------

Let's say you want that fancy new Automata Forge, and you think its market price is 2,000g. You're short on time and don't want to be bothered with selling your excess cards. The expected cost of getting it from buying 10-scroll packs is 30\*1000g = 30,000g since there are 30 total rares in the game, Automata Forge is a rare, and each 10-pack gives you one rare. 1-scroll packs have the same distribution over time as 10 packs, so they'll be same. With energy scroll packs, you will need to buy 10 packs to get a rare on average, and there are 9 rares in energy right now, so that's 10\*9\*175g = 15,750g which is much better. **But, the cheapest expected cost at the store (15,750g) is still much greater than the market price (2,000g), so you should just buy it on the market if your goal is to get that one card and not be bothered with selling.**

Now let's take into account the extra money you could make from selling everything don't care about. In order to get that Automata Forge, you'd expect to have to either buy 300 random scrolls or 90 energy scrolls. For random scrolls, that means you would expect to have 29 rares (you keep the Forge), 60 uncommons, and 210 commons. My spreadsheet tells me that the avg price for r/u/c is 584g/192g/80g. So that means we now have 29\*584g + 60\*192g + 210\*80g = 45,256g in extra cards to sell. Wow! **If we sell all the extras at market price, we now have made 15,256g in profit on an initial spend of 30k! That's a 50.85% profit!** Really, we shouldn't be surprised based on that initial table above. If we do the same math for buying energy scroll packs, we make is 8\*720g + 18\*162g + 63\*78g = 13,590g, which is a negative profit of -2160g. ~~But, if we kept buying energy scrolls just to sell, by the time we bought 300 we would probably be making more money than the randoms, since we know the return is greater over time from the chart above.~~

-------------------

For another example, let's say you want a complete set of growth cards, and couldn't give a shit about the other factions. Let's also pretend that you think trading is for suckers, so you're only concerned with the initial cost of the packs you'll buy. Your want list consists of every card in growth. Buying a growth pack means you spend 175g and definitely get a card from your list. Buying a random scroll pack means you expect to purchase 3 packs for a total of 300g to get your next scroll. The obvious way to start is through buying all the cards costing 175g or less on the market. Done. Now we're down to 18 cards I won't list here. We need 9 of the 10 growth rares (.90), 8 of 15 growth uncommons(.53), and 1 of 47 growth commons(.02). If we get a growth pack the chance of getting a card you need is (.10\*.90)+(.20\*.53)+(.70\*.02) = 0.21. Let's round to 20%, a 1 in 5 chance. So we would need to buy about 5 growth packs to get any one card we need at a cost of 175g\*5 = 865g. A similar calculation for random cards results in (.10\*.30)+(.20\*.17)+(.70\*.01) = 7.1% chance. To get one card we need, we would buy about 14 packs for 1400g. So, we now buy all the cards that cost less than 865g from our list on the market. Now, there's only 5 cards we need, all rares. Energy packs give a (.10\*.50)= 5% chance of getting one of those rares. **That's 20 packs for a total of 3500g just to get one of the last cards we need. At this point we should just buy all of our cards on the market.** But that's only because we currently believe selling cards is the devil.

Once again, let's take into account potential profit from selling. I'm starting to get bored, so it's a lot. It's a lot of profit. It approaches 53% profit over time if you're buying randoms. Just buy packs and sell your extras to the market. Please, don't make me do any more math. T.T

----------------------------

Because I know you need it:

**TL;DR Spend all your money in the shop, then sell all the cards you don't want on the market. Every 1g you spend in the shop will come back to you eventually, and it will bring it's little gold friends, and you will get ALL the cards you want. Eventually. Buying cards from the market is strictly a convenience, and don't forget that when you spend gold on the market, you don't get that 50%+ return.**

edit:

Here's [the spreadsheet](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/5429290/scrolls%20calculations.xlsx) I used.

edit2:

[Exuion](http://www.reddit.com/r/Scrolls/comments/1hps38/some_math_on_how_to_buy_cards/cawu2su) and [theblackhole25](http://www.reddit.com/r/Scrolls/comments/1hps38/some_math_on_how_to_buy_cards/cawou8d) both point out that this is isn't the whole story since I haven't compared the amount of gold you make trading during a set time to the amount of gold you can make playing the game during that same time.

There's a lot of variables that determine how much you make playing over time such as game type, win rate, and average game time. Also the amount of gold you make over time while trading depends on what cards you are selling, how high you are selling compared to the market median, and how effective your advertising (or spamming) is. 

As such, the logic of this post is only applies as the best way to use your gold and cards to get more gold and more cards if time weren't an issue, and not the best way to make money in general or even necessarily the best way to spend your *time* trading. Look at the data in this post as something like a theoretical maximum return; your actual trading efficiency will likely result in a much smaller return.",,False,self,t5_2scq0,1373127696.0,,flair-energy,True,t3_1hps38,http://www.reddit.com/r/Scrolls/comments/1hps38/some_math_on_how_to_buy_cards/,

**EDIT:** The cards found in the precons bought in the store ***are*** tradable.

Since starting Scrolls, I have asked around and researched a lot. All in hope trying to find out if the second and third precon decks are worth their price. My initial approach was finding out if buying each card from traders would be cheaper than buying the precon deck. I have not taken Scroll Packs and/or boosters into the equation. This takes out the random factor and enables one to make a calculation.

Here is a complete price list for each precon, based on http://trading.scrolls.pw/ as of June 2013.

Based on these calculations, one can conclude that every precon deck is worth the 6.3k gold. Do keep in mind though that basically always, you will want to exchange cards in the precon deck. Thus it *might* be cheaper to buy every card separately if you already have a deck in mind. 



If you find any errors in my calculations or find a price that seems completely unreasonable, just tell me in the comments and I'll change the list. I don't think I'll be taking the time to update this list, if you would like to continue this or use this somewhere else, please do!

I see so many threads about people that is seeking help in just winning their first match. Insted of keep answearing every single thread so did i decide to put up this thread that will hopefully help relieve some of work of answearing all these questions until this thread is buried in the reddit grave.


I am a high ranked order player and can only give tip of playing the game in general and how to play order, i welcome all kind of support people can give to this thread to fill in the basic concept how to play growth and energy. I could give out my opinion in how to play energy and growth but i am to afraid to send wrong information there, for example so am i not sure of how effective illthorn and useless contraption is which are 2 main scrolls that beginners have in their deck. I find them useful but can not garantee they are something you should value highly.




**GENERAL**


* 1 *Dont be afraid to lose Idols, you need 3 to win, not 5.*

The more Idols you have the harder it is to defend, and the more your opponent attack your Idols the less damage is dealt on your own units, and units is what gives boardcontrol, and boardcontrol is what wins games.


* 2 *Keep it down to 50scrolls*

The reason is that the cards are re-shuffled when all the cards have been used (usully around turn 20) which means if you for example play out your honorable general and he dies, you wont see him again for a much longer time if you had 70cards, and you want to see him often, same goes with other cards like speed, great wolf, burn etc.


* 3 *Ignore idols and hunt down opponents units.*

As mentioned before, boardcontrol is what wins game, not damage on Idols, and what gives board control? several things, but without making it to complex so is the core thing that you have more units out then your opponent, so always hunt down your opponents units, that is all that matters.


* 4 *Always sacrifice every turn*

It do not matter if it is your honorable general, or violent dispersal or great wolf, sacrifice it, if you are not going to use the scroll within 2 turns then it falls in the ""can sacrifice"" category. Of course there is exceptions to this rule but you rather sacrifice to much then to little, 90% of times so will you have done the right choice in sacrificing.


* 5 *Let Idols tank damage and regroup 2 rows away if behind.*

If you are behind and lost board control (basicly your opponent have more units then you) then the best way to recover is not to put units infront of their army and stall for a miracle scroll. The way to do it is to let your Idol tank damage and put down units there your opponent can not reach you for atleast 2 turns and regroup your forces. Dont get me wrong, it is hard as balls to do a recovery but that is the way to go.


* 6 *The center row is the most vital one*

Whoever can control it have huge power in the game, by being in the center row so are you only 2 moves away at max from any other row, giving you big flexibility to hunt down your opponent, and most importantly so do you choose if you wish to control the 3 idols from top to mid, or bottom to mid, it is really hard to try control 2 idols and a third seperate one several rows away from the other 2.


* 7 *Check some stream and youtube clip for more insight in the game* 

It can give you ideas at how to play the game, 2 stream channels for example is ""lethalfrag"" and ""tornis"", even if lethalfrag is not a elite player so can any player give inspiration for you. 2 youtube channels that you can visit is Acidjib and Blinky00849, they have posted some good videos for newcomers.


* 8 *Rush to about 5resource and then get cards.*

Regarding sacrificing  so do i suggest that you only sacrifice to get resource and reach about 5-7, after that only sacrifice for more scrolls. Atleast for a while, of course if you need more resource for some reason like god hand then do so.


* 9 *Remember what you got and you know what you will get.*

As mentioned above, the deck is usully re-shuffled around turn 20, this is a great thing to have in mind, if you can keep track of the important cards, like knowing you have only got 2 skirmishers so far, then you know when your at turn 15 that getting the 3:rd skirmisher is quite high, if you are able to count the cards so will you be able to plan for the future turns alot easier.




**ORDER**


* 1 *Skirmishers are your sword, you do not win with shield.*

Skrimishers are the most important unit you have and needs to be protected at all cost (except for the cost of Honorable general), if you dont have Skirmishers then you do not have the damage output you need to win.


* 2 *Precon decks are weak but not worthless.*

Every precon deck is bad but that do not stop you from winning, the main streangh in Order is having a frontline like a shield that defend the backline which is the sword, as mentioned so is the skirmishers the sword, the shield very from spearman to infantrymen depending on if you face melee or ranged units, spearman is good against melee and infantrymen are cheap enough to tank the range ones.


* 3 *Manipulate the field with your spells, your special in that.*

Another streangh within order is all their tricks, growth is quite straightforward with their enchantments, their only real trick is haste. Energy is straightforward with their direct damage and only real trick they got is some enchantment scrolls they got which you have to fight around. Order however have several things that will catch your opponent offguard, you can increase your movement and decrease your opponents as well as flip them around and several other scrolls to manipulate the playing field, these are the scrolls you have to use until you get the vital speed scrolls and such, these cards are not weak, they are just not prefered over speed and other scrolls.


* 4 *Keep eye open for your countdowns* 

It dous not matter if you have 8 units out and your opponent 2 if your units that are about to attack next turn keeps getting picked off.


***Against another Order***


* 1 If they open with crossbowmen, then you answear with infantrymen as shield, using skirmisher as damage output. If they open with anything else then you can defend with spearman.


* 2 Only open with crossbowmen if you can defend him within the next turn, meaning if you have a infantry in your hand.


* 3Whoever gets the general first and manage to get speed or haste for him first is usully the winner, therefore so are these cards of highest priorety to save.


* 4 Pother is the answer for waking stones.


***Against Growth***


* 1 they have no range units so spearman is the big deal here, you always want them, waking stone are also really effective when it comes to lower ranks (high ranks splash in pother).


* 2 The spearman only last so long however, they have answears to them with high health relentless great wolf and kinfolk veterans, this spike of power arrives at 5growth resource, embrace yourself for that impact.


* 3 So how do you embrace it? well first of all hunt down their units all the time, it is more important here then in any other matchup as growth just overwhelms you if you do not keep them in check. Again so is skirmishers so very important, they must be kept alive or their numbers will grow becouse you lack the damage.


* 4 If you get kabonk then try to save it for taking out that veitr of the wild, but of course sacrifice it if you must.


***Against Energy***


* 1 energy can play several kinds of decks, if it is gravelocks then you can treat it a bit like facing another Order, with the gravelock Elders being the Honorable Generals, they must die.


* 2 If they are not gravelock then spread your units out, the spell ""thunder surge"" they can do will decimate your troops if the hug eachother, leaving the survivors to die against the units they have. It is very much posseble that they have thunder surge even when they play with gravelocks but often so are the gravelocks so close to eachother that you need to be close with your units aswell in order to deal with them in time and that is more important, but of course try to not hug if posseble.


* 3 The key scrolls are the ones that manipulate positions against energy, that being ""pushback"", ""flip"" and ""pother"", energy has alot of structures that they can not move and enchantments that will stop you from getting into the backline, as well as hellspitter mortar standing in your way. These postion cards are the vital answers to it, it will mess up their plans heavily.


* 4 I know all the spells they do on you are frustrating, but bear in mind that when they use something like burn so is that resources they use to remove your unit but get none of their own, while you remove their units and keep your own units to keep on fighting another day. So it all adds up in the end.

I will say, however, that the cosmetic monetization is wholly unattractive. I for one don't really notice (nor care) what my opponent's avatar looks like, and I'm the type to spend a whole bunch of money on cosmetic avatars/skins in games. No idea if the game devs frequent this subreddit, but I just like to talk about this kind of stuff.

Couple ideas for cosmetic, non-gameplay related monetization:
- Idols. This could spruce things up a bit without affecting gameplay, as it can be a bit boring staring at the same idols all the time. Customized idols, especially if they can be constructed in a modular manner like the avatars, can not only drive monetization but player attachment to defending and attacking idols.
- Unit appearances. This would take significantly more work, but alternate skins for units would be very noticeable and appealing. The challenge would be to retain visual clarity and uniqueness for each unit.
- Unit animations. Potentially tied in with unit appearance skins, but may be easier to undertake alone since the challenge of visual clarity can be circumvented. I personally wouldn't mind my Iron Ogres doing cool flips while hulk smashing.

I understand Mojang isn't about milking revenue from its players, but I feel that there is too low of a ""max spend"" in Scrolls. When related to gameplay-related goods, that's fine and in this case desirable to me. For players who want to customize and get shinies though, that can be a negative to all parties.

I'm probably going to pay $20 on Monday and start playing right away. However, I do feel like they are pricing it a bit high, and I think some of it might just have to do with the fact that they are pushing the game under the Mojang name. Because Minecraft was super successful, they feel like they can push this game at a cost similar to Minecraft's current cost ($26.95). However, I think we can all admit that Minecraft primarily became great, famous, high-selling, etc. because of Notch's extensive work - and I don't think he's really had a hand in this game either. The game is just being made by his company and while I'm sure he's had some input, it is pretty clear this is not his project. I don't want to seem like I'm putting the current developers of Scrolls down or anything, but I think part of the reason they put the price point of Scrolls so high is because people have a high regard of Mojang because of Minecraft which the guys making Scrolls didn't really have a hand in.

Secondly, let's go back to Minecraft's current price point ($26.95). This is at the time of official release and I think we can probably say the price will not be raised anymore. I have heard that Scrolls will follow Minecraft's iterative process in that the price point will eventually go up over time. However, Minecraft's initial price point was around $10-15 when it went up for public purchase. If Scrolls is similar to Minecraft's pricing model, I think we can expect for its price to be raised to around $30-40 once it is finally officially released.

That, combined with the fact that there are several somewhat similar TCGs coming out from other well known companies (Hearthstone, Solforge, Hex) makes me and probably many others put off by the price point being offered by Scrolls. Blizzard is arguably a more prestigious company than Mojang, they've put out several reputable titles (Starcraft, WoW, Diablo) compared to Mojang's 1 reputable title (Minecraft) and they are offering their TCG, Hearthstone, for free. Now, of course, there are differences, and it is possible Hearthstone could be pay 2 win. This is why I am still excited for Scrolls (it seems that Hex, Hearthstone, and Solforge all have the potential to be Pay 2 Win whereas in Scrolls I have to pay a one time fee to get in and I'm competitive with everyone else without paying anything else). However, I believe this may put the vast majority of the gaming populace off of the game. Already, people on /r/games and /r/gaming are complaining about the way that the game looks, etc.

Habits like:
* Posting ads that take up the entire chatbox height, practically clearing it out (yes, I know you can resize the chatbox, but who actually does that?)
* Giving WTB ads with terrible prices, every card marked down by at least 200g (this really hurts new players who don't know the proper prices yet)
* Trying to shark players who seem new

The last has happenned to me with selling a heritage at 480g. I got a trade invite from a major trader, who's first request was whether i would consider trading card for card. When I told him that he didnt have any cards i felt were worth the heritage, he then tried to convince me that Heritage was ""just an uncommon"" and ""really isn't worth that much"". I assume my small deck size made him think I was new enough to be taken advantage of, but I just ended the trade.

Lastly, these ""major"" traders have themselves admitted that they have masses of gold (hundreds of thousands) - why are they still sharking?

1373557823.0,33,self.Scrolls,1i33ys,A guide on how to beat Order with Energy,35,2,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/Scrolls/comments/1i33ys/a_guide_on_how_to_beat_order_with_energy/,"Hello people,

Some of you might know me, some might not, but anyways, I'm Sho7gun and I play Energy. Atm I'm 1902, but I did manage to get to the top 30 (untill I got a massive bad luck draw streak and fell down into the abyss, from which I managed to climb out again). Now, it isn't easy climbing as energy, however, I managed to climb this far because I was lucky to play against a lot of Order.
I know a lot of you might think 'But Order beats Energy, right?'. Well, I'm always happy when I'm against Order, because I tend to just win that matchup 80% of the time. How? Well, I'm going to tell you. Btw, you should not think you'll win everything by just reading this, because games still have RNG and you still have to think a lot during the games. Besides, it's not as easy as I'm making it sound, but in my opinion, it's not as hard as others are saying.



First things first, the deck I'm using right now: http://www.scrollsguide.com/deckbuilder/#5261



You might think 'Omg, he doesn't use tick bombs or CF. AND NO MORTARS?!'. Well, here's the reason why. Tick bombs are only good against Energy, and pother does almost the same thing, but is far more versitile. Next, I don't use CF because it's expensive for what it does. And I opted to get rid of mortars in favour of outcasts, because mortars can be played around with through the use of pothers, and outcasts serve the same purpose but can still be moved and can reliably kill (and attack idols). 



Ok, onto the guide. There are 5 rules I follow when playing against order:



Rule nr. 1: Be agressive. With that I mean start playing creatures immediatly. You want to build up your creatures as soon as possible. If you get an early forge, play it immediatly, because forges are awesome against order. If you play the forge in the mid lane, put it in front so you can use it as a wall and can still move through the lanes. However, if you don't want to use it as a shield, put it in one of the sidelanes in the middle. Reason being that you can still protect it. Other than that, play many creatures and be agressive (although watch out for skirmishers, don't hunt for them unless you have to, but that depends soley on the situation)



Rule nr. 2: Keep the board clear. With that I mean, seriously, keep the board clear. If you can use a bombard to kill his creatures, do that instead of putting down a big creature. Order relies on having many creatures on the field to buff eachother and you don't want that. Generals are the first to go (see rule nr 3). After that comes the skirmishers. Then you can go for vanguards and stuff. Save that burn to kill a turn 3 skirmisher. You should care less about the spearmen. 



Rule nr. 3: ALWAYS KILL THE GENERAL! This means you want to keep your VD just for him. Generals win order games. He is the rally and the bombard for order, and you don't want him hanging around. If you have to spend two cards, so be it, just get rid of him. Even when he's alone he's dangerous. 



Rule nr. 4: Beware of Mangonel + Speed. This combo has become very popular recently. Most of the time you can know if someone has mangonels. Most of the times they don't run waking stones or decimates when they run mangonels. So when you see those, you can ease your heart and be very happy (unless you meet that one guy who does, so you might still be aware). You can play around them by positioning your units in such a way, it can only kill two units max, making it an even trade (and him wasting speed). After the mangonel has been played, kill the thing. Don't keep mangonels alive, cause live mangonels will bite you in the arse. So beware, don't clump up and make the mangonel trade as even as possible. 



And now for the 5th rule, which I always call rule nr. Whatever: THEY ALWAYS HAVE SPEED! If they have 0 speeds in hand, they will get the speed if they need one. Always count on speed. This is the reason why you want to get rid of the general. If you don't count on speed, you'll lose. They will always have it, even if they don't. Remember this one, as it might be the most important rule.



Energy doesn't win of Order in the lategame, we win by getting controll in the midgame and keeping the board clear all times through either kill spells or through cards like bombard and fury. If you can kill all creatures, do so. Don't wait one more turn. Just following these rules won't make you auto win, but it can increase the chances of winning. So just play a lot, don't play to hastily, think about all options and know what your opponent can play in his turn to ruin your day. When you're keeping the board clear, it doesn't matter how many cards he has in his hand or how many resources he has through imp resources, everything he plays will die and he will make very bad trades, evening the card advantage in the hands out. 



If you have any questions, you can ask them, I will try to answer them. If you want to see me play, you can because I do stream sometimes during the day at twitch.tv/sho7gun. And watch other people play, even order players, because you can learn a lot about their thought process and why they do stuff. There are a lot of good players streaming, so do watch them and it can greatly help with your own game.

OLD TEXT  ~~(I find the Scrolls Wiki to be quite terrible (out of place cards, and missing cards) so I decided to make a spreadsheet with all of the cards and their info. It's 3 separate pages, Growth/Order/Energy. On each page the cards are sorted by Drop/Cost, and within those are sorted by Type. Some cards are missing still because the Wiki doesn't have them, but I feel like this is a good start. I'll keep updating this as much as I can. Feel free to take it off Media Fire:~~

~~Link: http://www.mediafire.com/view/wpnrdcbi4q6448s/ScrollsCardList.xlsx~~

~~Please only comment if you see a mistake, or have a card that I am missing. Please give me Growth/Order/Energy, Name, Type, Rarity, Drop/Cost, Attack-Countdown-Health, and any text. I'll get the mistakes fixed and cards added asap. Thanks)~~


EDIT 1: I have added Imperial Resources, Mangonel, Decimation, Thunder Surge, and fixed Proximity Charge.

Edit 2: Added Roasted Bean Potion (Order, 2 Cost, Enchant, Rare)

Edit 3: Added Plating (Energy, 1 Cost, enchant, common)

Edit 4: Added Iron Whip (Energy, 2 Cost, Spell, Uncommon)

Edit 5: Added Machination Mindset (Energy, 3 cost, enchant, uncommon)


EDIT 6: I have added the ability to let you guys comment on the document (if you see a mistake) Please don't abuse this, just comment the section that has an error and I'll fix it asap. If this is abused I'll just remove the ability to comment and that won't help anyone.

What if pother were removed from the game? how much would that effect the game? Because i believe pother is the big culprit when it comes to structures not really being playable. Everyone can run pother, and it disables the protection structures offer. Of course there is other disadvantages with structures but pother kinda removes their main role. And i am then of course not talking about mangenol or ancestral totem, those you do not use for protection.


If pother were gone, what would be the option to deal with structures? Order would likely still be ok, they got flip and pushback. But those two scrolls do you not splash so what about the others? Energy may have to start take in some tick bombs and such and growth would be back with having a headache.


Or do you people think defensive structures still would not be common even if pother was gone? That may very well be the case, after all so is defensive structures only stalling, but sometimes so is that what you need.

The game is terribly slow on slow connections to begin with, which I understand. But if my connections drops for a second, I always lose a turn, because Scrolls takes ages to find out somethings wrong and reconnects.

If I could take a bit more in my own hand and figure out that the connection dropped by myself and hit the reconnect button ASAP, that would save me a lot of useless waiting.

Just leave a message here or join the chat room ""TD"".

I'm thinking the tournaments would be a small BO3, only 4 or 8 players, depending on the popularity. I would reward people with scrolls, not gold.

First place reward: God Hand (Rare)

Second place reward: Gravelock Elder (Uncommon)

Third and Fourth place: Undecided (2x common each)

EDIT 2: Since someone has already offered to donate to the prize pool, I've had a better idea. Each winner will be able to choose from growth, order and energy rewards, so if the first place player is order, they wont get stuck with a scroll they can't use.

I will be releasing a google docs with all the cards available in the prize pool soon and if anyone else wants to donate to it, they can let me know.

So, What's going on? It seems that the game is getting stale with no new content and that people are getting bored and jumping ship, this effects a lot of aspects of the game.

The trading market is hurt, fewer traders, fewer trades etc. Fewer people playing, queues take longer, fewer games get played.. 

This is a great game, I love it.

But it seems like there are some things that may need to be done to right the ship and stop the decline in active players. 

Crafting is not it...  I think releasing Decay may be the only thing that will save it, and get some advertising of some sort out there perhaps, who knows... but I hope that Mojang take action rather than just sitting on their laurels and letting things slide further downhill.

The collection would ofcourse first be complete when u have 3 of each card. And the cards u dont have 3 of should be grayed out. This would be really nostalgic for me as i collected both Magic the gathering and pokemon when i was younger, and for people like me that are obsessed with collecting things in games this would be a perfect addition. You could also add foiled cards for even more collection!

Replays are the last ""major"" feature I have for ScrollsPost right now, next will be refining whats there and improving on it (spectating/live replays in-browser/card statistics/etc).

---

The ScrollsPost mod from Summoner (as of v1.0.4/v1.0.5) now supports full replays recording and watching with opt-in uploading to ScrollsPost (automatic or ask after each game).

For watching replays, it supports speeding up/slowing down of replays as well as multi viewpoints, letting you see both players hands in a single game to help people who want to do casting via replay.

I made a little demo video showing the multi viewpoint feature which can be found at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpKaWw_gQc0 (it's only about 30 seconds). Seeking to a turn will speed up and disable most of the animations/delays to quickly get to the round you're looking for.

Replays are logged using the timing you played with. If you take 20 seconds to move, the replay will reflect that. Right now, you can just speed it up or slow it down to change the speed, but I'll add an option soon that lets you ignore it and play it on a set time period (X seconds per turn).

To watch a replay, type /scrollspost and go to Replay List, you can select a replay you recorded or one you downloaded.

---

Seeking/speed up/slow down is a work in progress. It's worked in my tests, but there are still one or two areas that can be improved so you can get to the round you wanted faster. It is however, a lot faster than waiting for 15 rounds to play out as it should only take &lt;5 seconds per round while seeking.

Multi viewpoint requires both sides of the replay to work, but you don't need to do any sort of merging. Replays are named ""&lt;game id&gt;-&lt;side&gt;.spr"", if you have ""4230774-white.spr"" you need ""4230774-black.spr"" in the same directory as ""4230774-white.spr"" and the mod will automatically show you both players hands throughout the replay. If you want to see this for yourself, you can download [this](http://www.scrollspost.com/replay/4230774-1/scrollspost-vs-shadowed) and [this](http://www.scrollspost.com/replay/4230774-0/scrollspost-vs-shadowed).


Those are the replays I used to make the quick YouTube sample video. I'll be making the process to view/download multi viewpoint replays better soon.

---

Once a replay is uploaded, it's available on the [replay page](http://www.scrollspost.com/replays). You can search by anything from deck types used to the players rating.

You can also view a page for a [specific replay](http://www.scrollspost.com/replay/4226202-1/dracon_ian-vs-shadowed) where you can see a breakdown of the game including the cards played and how many times. There's also a [game graph](http://www.scrollspost.com/replay/4226202-1/damage/dracon_ian-vs-shadowed) which graphs out resources with damage done, and when mouse overed shows the cards both sides played.

Replays can be viewed per player too, such as [my replays](http://www.scrollspost.com/replays/player/7jebbmzal427ud4ea6nq3sqesp/shadowed) which lists all the games I've uploaded to ScrollsPost.

---

Unfortunately, replays from the GameReplay mod are not compatible with this. The SPR format has extra metadata embedded for performance/new features which makes them not compatible and I didn't want to support both formats in the mod. I will be adding a converter on ScrollsPost.com that will do the conversion for people who are interested, and if you really want your existing GameReplay's in this one, send me an email with the replays attached and I'll send you back the converted version.

---

As always, if you have suggestions/comments, let me know either here or at shadow@scrollspost.com.

[EDIT]: If you are getting popups every time you login, this is a bug caused by whoever built the dll for ScrollsPost in Summoner, it's not exactly a bug in ScrollsPost. Until v1.0.5 is approved which will be rebuilt to contain the proper version, you can do this:

**Entry:**

To enter, find me in channel 'Lyee' and pay a 250g entry fee, and give me a Reddit or Scrollsguide username to send you the sign-up link and keep you up-to-date with information.

**When:**

The tournament is going to run at 18:00 GMT on Sunday the 7th of July until midnight GMT. If all goes as planned, sign-up links will be sent out some point during Friday the 5th, and should be completed before the Sunday, otherwise I'll look for replacement players and assume you can't make it. If a player drops out at any point and we can get a replacement quickly, their entry fee will be refunded, otherwise it won't.

**Format:**

Double-elimination, best of 1 until finals, which are best of 3.

I'm looking to get 32 players, the 16 with the highest ranked rating will go into one tournament, and the 16 with the lowest ranked rating will go in another. Hopefully this will avoid games being too 'stompy', which was a problem with the first tournament. These tournaments are intended to allow people to be creative, even if they aren't top-level players.


**Prizes:** (per 16 player tournament)

1st: 2000g  
2nd: 1000g 
3rd: 500g  
  
**Misc:**

If you're interested, you're encouraged to join channel Lyee and hang around. Lots of people there will be happy to test their No-Rare Deck against you so you can get a feel for the format and have some fun games.

Magic favors the defender, while this game favors the attacker. 

In Magic, the defender chooses which units, if any, block. Blocking costs nothing, defenders deal damage even if newly summoned, and attacking creatures can't block immediately after.

In Scrolls, units only deal damage when they attack, and the attacker has nothing to lose. Newly summoned units are just cannon fodder unless they're spearmen.

I'm convinced that these mechanics are the biggest reason that every deck is creature heavy, and why the game is so hard to come back from if you're down.

I really wish mojang would add more cards more frequently, and add more animations for spells and enchantments. I really hoped that they would add some really neat effects (maybe even slightly animated gif-like images) on the tier-3 version of scrolls. and what about animated battlefields? but then I thought maybe I am expecting and demanding too much. but after seeing what is possible in other software based card games, I feel like mojang's art team should really add more effects into this game. I know the devs are all in vacation right now and there are lots of other stuffs with higher priorities to do, but please dont forget the visual aspect of the game. nevertheless, thank you for your customer friendly company policy and for really listening to us! and thanks for scrolls :D

This may even influence people to make decisions - at least at lower-level play - based on waiting for their strange scroll to get drawn before they make a move, instead of finishing the match when they could.

Now, since my Photoshop skills are clearly lacking, I was going to try to make an amazing rendition of what a Shiny Kinfolk Brave might look like, but all I got was one with a little different coloring. 

http://i.imgur.com/lIkrY57.jpg

Ways this could work: 

* Shiny scrolls have a shiny border which is very noticeable and looks cool!
* The figure on the board which matches the scroll, has unique coloring, setting it apart from every other one, and it also has a shine to it.

When buying a pack of scrolls:

* Chance to pull a Shiny Rare Scroll- 1%
* Chance to pull a Shiny Uncommon Scroll- 2%
* Chance to pull a Shiny Common Scroll- 7%

I think I did my maths correctly...

I know this is just a cosmetic thing and would only add to collectibility, but I think it would give a lot of people more of a reason to buy packs of scrolls. Since I've been playing for few weeks now, I have just about all the scrolls I want and the temptation to buy a new pack of scrolls is nonexistent. Anyways, I think this addition would bring some added fun to the game, and give people a reason to buy packs of scrolls (ahem, gold sink). 

1/10, is just a random number I thought of. It could be 1/5 packs, 1/15 packs, or even 1/20... it doesn't matter so long as it doesn't feel impossible.

**Important** I decided to hold development on my mod and scrollstrader.com. There are a lot of nice sites out there that are more mature. To be on par with a lot of features i need a bot thats runs 24/7 h and thats just possible for me atm.

I can recommend: http://scrollspost.com/ and http://www.scrollstoolbox.com

The Deck Dubbed Kritical's Secrets
http://www.scrollsguide.com/deckbuilder/#3866

Why Ancestral Totem instead of crimson bull?

Ancestral improves our matchup against order since I've been seeing alot of order players recently.

Pother is also a given against order (those pesky waking stones and spiky 2 unit) its really easy to pick off targets ;).

Transposition is nice to have but only one is needed because you can just keep 1 in ur hand and 2 seems a bit too much.


Druids Burial ground is surprisingly really effective against growth mirrors as well because it completely counters rangers bane and also does really well against a suspected quake.

Purification is vital in this deck because of the recent pot of resist hype on growth mirrors and this makes them overextend a lane while you can laugh and clean up their row!!.

Why do I not run pot of resist?
Because I found out this gives me alot more dead hands than usual although I used to double splash when Noaidi was broken.

The rest is just basic growth stuff everyone has in their decks mainly. I chose to run 2 jarls and 2 godhands for lategame, and once again 3 is a bit too much as it gives you dead hands.

Likewise if I'm looking to buy and other people's ""WTB"" messages.

So what if I hopped into ""trading-wts"", submitted the card(s) I wanted to sell, then joined ""trading-wtb"" and watched for messages from people that might be potential people to trade with. (Alternatively if I'm buying, enter desired cards in ""trading-wtb"" and watch the ""trading-wts"" messages.)

If you see a message in the chat you're watching, initiate a trade and talk details.

Update: Let's give it a go? Join ""wts"" and ""wtb"" (less typing) when you log on and check the messages you care about between games or when you're looking to trade!

Pasted this once in ""Trading"" and got 5 people joining each channel immediately (it's a big block of text but seemed necessary to explain somewhat)

&gt; New Idea: Tired of reading messages from people trying to do the same thing as you are? (e.g. I'm selling something, I don't care about WTS messages). Join/post in ""wts"" if you want to sell or join/post in ""wtb"" if you want to buy. You can also join/read people's posts in the opposite channel to improve the chances you'll find someone to trade with. Let's see if we can make trading a little easier!

Update 2: About 10 people in each channel and I've already sold 3 cards by pasting in WTS and watching people's posts in WTB. So much more efficient and less spam.

Update 3: 25+ people in each channel, seeing some deals go down. Interesting to note that ""wtb"" is decidedly quieter. Also revised ""ad"" text that only takes up 2 lines to paste in other trade channels (I know spamming to reduce spam seems kind of stupid, but trying to spread the word to see if it takes off).

Both of us made a number of incredible moves, and oft as not the other would then counter with an equally impressive turn.

I've created the subreddit, /r/ScrollsDraft which I will be improving over the coming days to support the growing Draft community. There we can discuss strategies, potential implementations into the game client, and hopefully get some more people interested in this game mode so more draft games can be played in the future. This thread is quite long, but I'll try to answer as many questions as possible as well as format it in such a way that it's easily browsable.

**How To Draft**

First of all, I'll discuss what draft is for people who are unfamiliar. Currently, Scrolls has no official draft mode. The draft is completely simulated by [ScrollsGuide](http://www.scrollsguide.com/draft). There are some other draft formats being developed, and I'll discuss those later.

You can play a draft with any number of people, but 8 is optimal. Once 8 people join a draft game the actual drafting begins. Each of the 8 participants are presented with a virtual scrolls pack that contains 7 commons, 2 uncommons, and a rare. You then choose one of these cards that you may want to use in your deck. Once all 8 participants have chosen their scrolls, each participant passes their pack to the next participant (on odd rounds you pass down, on even rounds you pass up). This is automated, all you will see is 9 more scrolls to choose from. After that pick, you have 8 to choose from. This continues until each player only has one scroll left to pick from and these are essentially default picked (and they're generally bad scrolls like Faith Duty). Now everyone has picked 8 scrolls, and the process begins anew with 8 more virtual scrolls packs being distributed. This continues for 8 rounds, until all 8 participants have chosen 80 cards. You then have the option to cut up to 30 of these cards to make a playable deck of 50.

Now, the important thing to mention here is that you need to own a lot of scrolls to effectively draft. Ideally, you want 3 of every scroll in the game. This means you can draft any sort of deck you'd like. If you somehow draft 3 Automata Forges, you can't use any of them if you don't own them. Again, the draft is completely simulated, no actual scroll packs are purchased.

A tournament then follows. There's two ways to conduct this. Some people use a tournament management site like Challonge to keep track of the tournament, but usually it's a lot simpler. There are multiple ways to match participants, but what's becoming popular is a space of 4 to match people sitting the furthest away from each other, so that people who weren't influential over each others' picks play first. Some people prefer to match people who were closer so that the decks are less similar to one another's. It's up to preference, but I'll describe the first method. Let's say these are our participants:

* 1. John
* 2. Bob
* 3. Tim
* 4. Sarah
* 1. Alex
* 2. Sue
* 3. Zach
* 4. Joe

John would play Alex, Bob would play Sue, etc. After the first round, the winner of the ""4 matchup"" will play the winner of the ""2 matchup"" and the winner of the ""3 matchup"" will play the winner of the ""1 matchup."" If there are less than 8 participants, there may be byes or even a round robin point system style tournament.

Draft tournaments can take a lot of time (as much as 1-2 hours depending), so they're almost always single elimination. Drafts can either be for fun, or there may be prizes awarded by whoever facilitated the draft (these are usually conducted on twitch.tv streams). I will list popular streamers who sometimes hold drafts in a section below.

So hopefully by now you're familiar with what draft is and how it's played. 

**Why Draft?**

Personally, I've stopped playing Quick and Ranked Matches due to the stagnant meta game currently. This is not any sort of critique of the game, I just don't have as much fun playing with and against standard decks as I used to, and this is will definitely change in the future. But for now, I'll play a draft game anytime one is available simply because it's more fun for me. Not only is the process of quickly choosing and building decks on the fly incredibly entertaining, the games themselves are generally much more interesting and dynamic than standard games. Unplayed scrolls like Golem Skin and Shrine can suddenly win games. In short, if you love deck building and coming up with on-the-spot strategies, you will love draft.

**Draft Strategy**

All of the following will be my own opinions, you may disagree with them. This section is to facilitate discussion of the draft meta.

* 1. Energy is the most viable faction.

Probably a statement you never thought you'd hear, but it's true. And there are several reasons why Energy is so good at draft. First of all, Energy contains much less synergy than Growth or Order. In a draft, your pool of playable cards is extremely limited, which means even if you get lucky enough to draft a Great Wolf you will not have as many Mangy Wolves / Ragged Wolves / Brother of the Wolfs to support him. Getting both a single Honorable General and a Speed would be considered a successful draft, however it only takes one VD or Spark+Burn or just brute force to end that. Energy scrolls just work better as single units. A Cannon Automaton (which is uncommon!) needs nothing else to make it awesome. Also, you have much fewer ""power cards"" in a draft deck. This makes removal cards such as Violent Dispersal or Burn that specifically target these power cards much more useful.

Another thing that makes Energy such a powerhouse is that structures are actually viable. Very rarely are you ever going to see a Quake, and the chances of seeing 2 in the same game are massively slim. Charge Coils are ridiculously powerful. Ether Pumps are very good. Destroyers put in work. Even Goo Catapults can be useful. Drafting an Automata Forge is essentially an ""I win"" condition.

* 2. Creatures are important.

If you take a look at any standard competitive deck, it's going to be about 40-50% creatures. However, there is much less than 40-50% creatures if you consider all of the scrolls in the game. Therefore, you are always going to be creature starved in draft. Fertile Soil may be tempting, but a Brother of the Wolf can be a game winner. The ability to summon creatures is hugely important in draft, which is why I said drafting an Automata Forge is almost an ""I win"" condition before. Your opponent is also running less creatures than he'd like, which means he has less killing power than you'd expect. Focus on creatures when you draft, don't end up with 6 playables. 3 Bombards are nice, but not when your only ranged units are 2 Gun Automatons.

* 3. Don't underestimate unused scrolls.

Pretty straightforward. Enchantments can be good. Golem Skin + Iron Ogre has won games. A Skirmisher with a Crown of Strength is scary. A Kinfolk Brave with 3 Stag Hearts is usually gg. As I mentioned before, structures 

* 4. Consider what the people around you are drafting.

Remember, on odd rounds the person above you is passing to you, and on even round the person below you is passing to you. By keeping note of what kinds of cards are left in each pack that's passed to you, you can pretty reliably deduce what kinds of decks the people around you are playing. If someone passes you a Great Wolf they're probably not playing Growth, but if you're not seeing any good Order cards the people in front of you are probably playing Order. You can use this to your advantage by picking cards that you think will be valuable to the person you're passing to, or just denying certain factions to keep people from picking them.

**Resources**

As mentioned, /r/ScrollsDraft will be available for discussing and scheduling draft games. If we can get a large enough community I'd like to start some fun topics like rating specific cards within the draft format.

Also, there are many streamers who have done drafts in the past. The most important of these is Cubez as he streams very often almost soley to play draft tournaments with the community.

Yep, I'm looking at you guys) have accomplished.

With new scrolls and more precisely Decay coming soon^^^^TM , the whole meta is bound to change. What I would like to suggest for this subreddit to become more appealing for those (like me) that are not top tier players but strive to become better and are genuinely interested by the meta, deck building and theory crafting is:

* Have a (weekly?) official post discussing ""flavor of the week/15 days/month"" and what strats are rising in popularity in ranked queue.

* ~~Top rated redditors (iScrE4m, artr0x, Blinky, Syl, and so many others!) give some insight on how the meta is shifting. (this is harder to implement and, of course, I realize some of you already provide tons of insight through post, videos and streams; Please don't take this as a demand or as someone who is never satisfied ). I also know it is quite common for those guys to post what deck they have lately most used in Ranked but maybe have some insight on the theory crafting behind the deck (i.e. why run crimson over totem or vice versa).~~ Ignore this, I realize how dumb it is to ask for even more content from them. Sorry for sounding like a spoiled kid ._.'

* Noob friendly official threads: Somewhere people new to the game can get the answers for their questions without:

  A. Not being down-voted to oblivion

  B. Filling up the front page with repetitive questions that some might find trivial/uninteresting

  C. Reduce the number of repeated questions 

^(this idea comes from the ""Monday Mega-Thread"" over /r/leagueoflegends that some of you might be familiar with)

Another issue I have is the ""the down-vote issue"": I feel that here at /r/Scrolls people are really keen of the down-vote and tend to just use it as soon as they disagree with someone ([reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/help/reddiquette) disagrees). Maybe use what some other subs have done with smaller downvote buttons and a message reminding people when they should downvote).

Now, **please**, don't take this as a bashing of the community **or** of the sub. I think both are great and that the mods here are doing everything they can to make it a better place. I'm just trying to provide some constructive criticism and suggestions on how to improve.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HQRC0408mo is a quick example of importing/exporting decks in-game from the site.

When importing, it will automatically use the highest level cards you have. If a deck calls for 3 Honorable General's and you have a: lvl 3, lvl 2 and 2 x lvl 0, it will construct a deck with a lvl 3/2/0 automatically.

If you don't have enough cards to construct a full deck, it will give you a summary of how many cards + which cards you're missing.

Decks are saved into the URL automatically, as soon as you make a change the URL will update. You can immediately import or share the URL, no account required.

A few examples of my decks I exported: [Growth deck](http://www.scrollspost.com/deckbuilder#1;5y;5D;3L;63;5v;3U;OU;5H;4P;5b;5c;5L;y9;xS;5T;5j;zC;3M;5s), [Order deck](http://www.scrollspost.com/deckbuilder#1;Og;40;5I;62;yd;5L;5E;5J;5P;5S;4n;Op;Or;2c;4I;OV;Om;Os;yO) and the notorious [G/O Draw](http://www.scrollspost.com/deckbuilder#1;Og;5C;5D;63;5v;5H;6h;3z;5L;5E;y9;O5;Ob;OW;y5;5o;5j;4I).

I'll add some features to save decks to your account + a way of publishing a deck for people who want that soon.

Replays now include a ""best guess"" reconstruction of the decks used.

I'm not saying that because of this you should agree with my opinions but these are just a few things I've noticed about the game.

1.  Fighting vs growth basically comes down to whoever has the better starting hand.  If a growth player can place down a nice curve of creatures and you have nothing to react with, you lose.  I want to say that the vice versa occurs but growth has quake which is devestating against energy and immediately puts them back in the game from an empty board state.  If energy has an empty board, they have no easy way to recover.  Vs order is a lot more forgiving when it comes to starting hands.

2.  Fighting lower rated players is extremely unfair for the higher rated player.  The game seems to expect higher players to have a 90% winrate with lower players.  ""Oh, you just lost to someone in the 1800s?  -20.""  ""Oh, you won against that same person?  Don't call me impressed.  +6"".

The days of playing noobs (even though I've only been playing for 3 days) are over, and I feel like I've reached this bracket without knowing what I really need to know.

I play a mono order deck, with 30 creatures and 55 cards total. This seems like the best option to me. The difference between 50 and 55 cards for getting a creatures is like .45%. Questions like why having over 50 is considered bad still haven't been answered, and every time I go into a game I just feel like I can't compete. Order earlygame feels miserable as hell. Getting gold seems impossible now since I can't win any game and the gold flow has gone from an avalanche to a trickle.

Why are things like eye of eagle considered good when you could replace it with other creatures? Why is Sister of the Fox good? How am I supposed to control the balance between deck size and resource count?

I'm a CCG noob, yet somehow I climbed to 1600 from 0 in the last 24 hours and the game has become very hard to continue playing.

A lot of this community discusses various decks and what's in them without ever really explaining why it's good. Just... I don't know. Feeling lost as hell.

Edit: So I made two major changes, carrying 2 instead of 3 of the cards I wanted, and throwing in some cards that forced draw. I haven't lost a match yet, and my deck feels slightly more consistent, so that feels like a plus.

As energy, your entire goal is to make sure there's as few creatures on the opponent's side as possible.  By the time there's enough creatures to hit more than 3 or 4 of them with thundersurge, you're so far behind that doing 2 damage to a bunch of creatures doesn't do jack, and double thunder surge is improbable because most people spread out their creatures once one thundersurge hits.

1375205759.0,22,self.Scrolls,1jd0pg,Ideas for new mechanics that could be implemented,34,12,53,http://www.reddit.com/r/Scrolls/comments/1jd0pg/ideas_for_new_mechanics_that_could_be_implemented/,"So I posted a thread about scroll ideas, that disappeared pretty fast... but, I realized that I'd much rather have a discussion over mechanics that could be implemented rather than specific cards.

So, first

* Tile blocking - 

Scrolls is unique in the TCG realm due to the hex board + idol + animated creatures and whatnot, so why not make mechanics that play off of that? In my other thread I had the idea of a creature for order/decay that was a pharaoh that replaces units it kills with a move 0 creature with 0 attack 1 CD and 2 health, I feel like this would inspire some really interesting play for both players. Imagine that your opponent has a ton of bros on the board but you can streamline his units movement due to a tile being blocked in mid row, this gives you time to throw down a creature or two, or find some way to defend. Conversely, if you get streamlined, the unit blocking now has 1 CD, throw a focus/stag heart/desperation (etc.) on it and now it is suddenly working to your advantage. Also, maybe roasted bean pot would be useful finally :D

* Resurrection -

This would be tough to balance obviously, however, it could be really interesting at the same time. Say you have a creature that can resurrect one unit every 2 turns but only if that unit had died in the last turn. This would help with the insane amount of unit removal being added to the game, but also can be avoided by killing the creature that can resurrect others or simply avoiding killing the units you need dead on certain turns.

* Possesion - 

This is one my personal favorites. Imagine a scroll or creature effect that allows you to control one of the enemy units until the end of their turn. Of course, in order for this to not turn into another pother (minus the draw) the movement you choose or the use of the creature's ability would occur at the beginning of your opponent's turn. This would allow you to effectively use say... hexmonger's curse ability on that lumbering muckhead that you can now kill next turn, or move their 2 health brave into a trap of your spikey units on the top 2 or bottom 2 rows. Your opponent couldn't move it back that turn but they could position their units to avoid being moved like you already have to with a staggering muckhead.

* Scroll Search - 

This mechanic is something I think specifically only energy should have access to. Since energy is obviously not about the card draw, why not stick with mojang's theme of quality rather than quantity? Energy is supposed to be all about heavy hitters that can do all the work by themselves. If there were a creature that had an ability to search for one scroll and put it into your hand when countdown = 0, this would allow energy to get their quality cards out and sacrifice for resources to charge up their strong cards (another theme I've noticed with forge and solemn giant) instead of being forced to draw 90 trillion cards and never be able to sacrifice for resources. To balance this you could make the effect require that the card cost energy in order for you to put it into your hand.



So there's my short list of mechanical ideas, discuss, contribute, give feedback. I'll answer any questions and discuss how to balance in the comments!

**ALSO, what are your ideas for new mechanics??**



Edit: Forgot one. - 

* Death shielding -

Another tough to balance but interesting play/counterplay mechanic. This could be a spell or creature ability on countdown. It simply stops the creature that is enchanted from dying one time. This could be done several ways... one being that it reduces the health to 1 if it would have died. Another way could have the scroll be resummoned in metempsychosis style if it dies. In order for this to be balanced it would have to last only a single turn or cause the unit to be a lot less useful if the card had no turn limit.",,False,self,t5_2scq0,1375206796.0,,flair-multi,True,t3_1jd0pg,http://www.reddit.com/r/Scrolls/comments/1jd0pg/ideas_for_new_mechanics_that_could_be_implemented/,

1374345323.0,21,self.Scrolls,1ipgqr,Scrolls needs content ? No game company can compete against its customers when it comes to creating new content.,40,19,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/Scrolls/comments/1ipgqr/scrolls_needs_content_no_game_company_can_compete/,"Hey guys. 

tl;dr : Mojang should give us tools to help them create new content (art/models/animations).

There have been many posts these days about how the lack of content and features is killing the game, and how other online TCGs might attract more people and even draw players from Scrolls.

All of us would like more cards, and at the same time most of us are also well aware of the difficulties the developers might face during the implementation of a set cards. In addition to being a TCGs, the game is also a turn-based strategy game, and animations have to made, along with the art/the stats/the effects of the cards. These have to be implemented/debugged/polished. This takes time, and resources. 

What I'm gonna say is based on Gaben's conference that occured earlier this year, during which he basically said that no game company can compete against its customers in terms of content making potential. For any game, mods can appear, giving new models, new animations, new features, pretty much anything, and the devs who choose to roll with it are often successful.  

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8QEOBgLBQU

Now, let's talk about Team Fortress 2 for a bit. TF2 has never been the AAA game everybody's talking about. Unlike Call of Duty games (god I hate these) or League of Legends (I hate this even more, for having additcted to it during its early days), It's never been THE game everyone NEEDS to play. However, it's still alive after all these years, and slowly growing, thanks to a great community and to the ability Valve gave us to modify it and propose new content (weapons, hats, etc ...). There are people living off the selling of their TF2 hats ! Can you imagine ? 

Now, about Mojang. Mojang == ""the guys who made Minecraft"". I'm not kidding, when I talk about Scrolls with my friends, I say ""a TCG from the guys who made Minecraft"". And everybody knows that if Minecraft attracts so many players, it's because guys like you and I can make amazing stuff with it. 

http://imgur.com/r/minecraft 

See where I'm going with this ? In my opinion, Mojang should help us to help them (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=786PavIEAOQ). A community is a fucking amazing content generator, provided it has got the right tools. There are tons of guys who love Scrolls, and among them are tons of guys who must be talented artists, or some who have notions in animations, and graphics. Wasn't Scrolls made using Unity ? It would be great for Mojang to ask for help, and the simple opportunity (even if there's a lot of competition out there) of having our work actually incorporated to the game would be fucking great ! Any Magic player would love to design a card, even if he does not have the final word on the effect/the stats the card should have.  Mojang, please, give us a way to provide content for your game ! 

How should this be done ? Here are the some steps : 
0. GIVE US A TOOL TO INCORPORATE MODELS/DRAWINGS/ANIMATIONS AND WATCH HOW THEY RENDER INGAME. This is just what we need to go. 
1. Give us a way to upload the art (drawings / animations / models) into a database that use and that we can see and rate as well (because our opinion counts ... think Steam Greenlight) 
2. Review our art : if it's too far from the game's aesthetics, tell us. If it's close but not perfect, either ask us to make some changes or take the art and make some changes yourself. 
3. If our art is selected to be incorporated in the game, give us fucking rewards. Could be a number of boosters, could be gold, could be a mention ""animations designed by *"" in the deck builder, etc"".
4. ??? 
5. PROFIT ! 

Why am I saying all this ? Because what Mojang needs to release a new set of cards is much more expensive than what the others need in terms of time and resources (due to the TBS nature of Scrolls). And Mojang does not have a huge team. I'm a Tribes : Ascend player, and I can say that Tribes is dying. It's dying because it lacks content, fixes, and because the developers do not have resources to spare to fix stuff and add new maps/guns and balance things (most devs at Hirez are now working on their Moba). But I seriously think that if they had given us an SDK from the start, it wouldn't be the same. I don't want another game I love withering like Tribes. After listening to what Gaben said, I deeply believe he is right in the fact that the future of video games business models resides on the inner ability of players to provide content. And that is what I would like Mojang to do. Please Mojang, learn things from your own success !! We players love building stuff, and we'd be more than happy to help you with Scrolls. At lease in my humble opinion. 

On top of that, crafting would be much more relevant if we could actually customize the cards when they reach their highest level, for instance by giving them custom names (think TF2 and how people can name their weapons) and perhaps changing some colors on the models. Of course, the names should be submited for approval ... I wouldn't like to see an Analrapist: Kinfolk Veteran. But giving our cards identities would feel great with the stats, and would give additional value (WOW, this is the card the #3 used during the last tournament). If community-created stuff could be ""crafted"" to improve and modify the look of a unit on the board, how great would it be ?


There you go...English not being my first language, I hope this wasn't too much of a hassle to read. I know implementing ways for the community to propose content would take a bit of time, but on the medium/long run, I'm 99.99% sure it would be worth it. If we want to have expansion packs of 50+ cards every few months, I can't see better ways than making the community contribute.

1374249153.0,20,self.Scrolls,1imyat,Opposite to gloom and doom post,57,37,44,http://www.reddit.com/r/Scrolls/comments/1imyat/opposite_to_gloom_and_doom_post/,"Everyone has been mentioning the potentials in the game so i do not really have to repeat that to much, it has a unique hex board feature and interesting mechanics etc.


So what is the issue? atm many is running around in panic afraid their game is sinking and yelling at the captain to not hit the iceberg. Allow me to take the concerns one by one and counter argue them. And yes i know many already know this or agree to this but the massive outbreak in doom prophecy lately made me want to post this.


**1:Massive drop in players.**

The game was hyped when beta opened its doors but hype only last so long. Many have left now feeling ""mhe not my thing"" or as equal many probebly are feeling so is it ""this has alot of potential and i love it, but nothing much happened lately so i do something else"" and those people will be back, dont worry, same thing when decay is released, another wave of shit ton of players will come back and after a week or so they will take a break and people will start they doom prophecy again. WoW is a entirely different beast but same concept there, people play new content, then are bored, game is ""doomed"" and new content arrives. ""It is the ciiiiiircle of gaaAAAMEEES..."".


**2:There is not enough content**

Of course there is a lack of content, that is what beta is for, to add content and see how it is working out. Yes yes mojangs definition of ""beta"" is pretty much ""released with lack of content"" but that is only based on minecraft, if you look at minecrafts progress rate and goal so is Scrolls their third/second game much better, content alot more often and you can definitely see where this is going and they tell us what plans they have, unlike minecraft there it was pretty much dark in a month and then suddenly we had pixel wolfs for immersion or something, who knows. Here we know whisper, decay, freindlist, tournament and other stuff will be implanted, it just needs some time. And we usually get something new about ever second week or so, that is not bad for a small team with half staff if not more is on vacation.


**3:There is a lack of communication from mojang**

What is it you want specifically? a Vlog? sure they could do more but do not come with that bullshit that they do very little communication. They write in twitch chat, in reddit, in forum, in chats ingame, sends news about coming content and list goes on. I could probably answer your question for them that you have, with information they have given earlier that i have read.


**4:The balance being so bad**

I actually laugh at this because been in other communities for so long, especially starcraft so have i given up on this a long time ago, people will never learn and always complain. But sure let me repeat what has been said several times.

Game history:

Rock-Papper-Scissor:""this is so poor game design, this needs a fix!""

Growth dominance:""remove this fucking quake! this needs a fix!""

Go-Draw dominance:""FUCK THIS SHIT! HOTFIX NOW!""

Growth dominance:""like 80% of top 100 is growth this needs a fix!""

Order dominance:""omg order is so damn op this needs a fix!""

And all of this in like 4-5 weeks, while it has been going on for years in starcraft and people keep complaining how as soon the flavor change for some reason (usully new strategy) so is that op. So excuse me to not take these critique to seriously. I will not deny however the Noaidi had a big impact and did need a fix. Also to all energy players, your time will come, mojang seem to be going a different direction with you, using things like automata forge to keep up with card draw, when you have the tool you need to make the next great strategy so can i guarantee no one will know for a good while how to deal with it and you be blamed to be op.


**5:Mojang needs to step up if they are to compete with other tcg**

Scrolls dont need 5 million players or something, 100k is fine. The important part is mojang makes profit, ingame economy is stimulated and there is big enough player base to get matches in same skill level. And i would not worry about this, yes it is in decline for the moment but that is not relevant, what is relevant is how it is when released. And why will it succeed? Because it is unique, not pay to win and will have several modes later so there will be something for most people. That is all it needs to stick out enough to have its place. This becoming a giant and takes the e-sport scene? that is not needed and not likely but who knows.


If you have more points to come with why the game is doomed then feel free to comment and i will comment back. As final note so do i wish to say that mojang has done a great job with this game, it is not slow and dreadful progress like minecraft, and they listen to community adding test server, fixing noaidi, answering questions in different forums and chatting with people ingame. Even if this will be a small game so will i have allot of fun with it when they make the official release that i can guarantee, if you want to take the lifeboat then i do not mind, i be leaning back on my chair here and adding ice from the iceberg in my drink while you do that.",,False,self,t5_2scq0,1374281193.0,,flair-order,True,t3_1imyat,http://www.reddit.com/r/Scrolls/comments/1imyat/opposite_to_gloom_and_doom_post/,

I think it's the main reason why Energy feels mediocre late game(Can't burn units when you never see them before they hit you) and why ridiculous counter units like Spearmen are ""balanced"" in OvG.


I don't mind if it's something that you can see before it hits you like using Blessing of Haste/Iron Whip or stuff you can defend against like Thunder Surge, but things like Speed + General/Speed + multiple mangonel drops(rare but fun)/God Hand/Quake/ect take away more from the game than they add.  For instance, I don't use a single unit in my Order deck with less than 3 hp because these units are almost never worth the scroll cost.

Stuff like this just leaves both players with smaller scroll selection and fewer meaningful choices in game.

This game doesn't have instants like MTG so having super strong spells with essentially zero counter play(other than save up cards and do it yourself next turn) seems like a bad idea to me.

Seems like it would be better if the more ridiculous things got toned down somewhat and other cards buffed so that we get more diversity.  I mean at this point, I see Quake in 2/3 of all games against Growth and Pother in 3/4 of all games.

Pretty much every solid deck that I have seen has used predictable cards and uses alpha strike/wombo combo stuff to win, so I think changes are needed.

You could argue that there aren't enough scrolls released to really have a lot of variety, but there are enough bad scrolls that I don't really think that that needs to be true.  Order alone has about 10+ scrolls that I would never think about using.  My guess is that the other factions are similar.

I feel this will further the scrolls community by not only adding a professional feel to the game's already massive fan base but also provide a large amount of video's for the newer players.

If successful I would hope that we would start to see consistent names popping up fighting for the top places in these tournaments, furthering not only their glory but bringing brand recognition to scrolls though the means of these 'pro player'.

And Other Card Errors.,29,7,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/Scrolls/comments/1ggzhw/psa_proximity_charge_dont_harm_ranged_units_and/,"Despite the card [Proximity Charge](http://www.scrollsguide.com/wiki/index.php/Proximity_Charge) stating attacking units that kill Proximity Charge are dealt 4 damage, this ability does not apply to ranged units.

1376241541.0,20,self.Scrolls,1k5hs2,Proposed gametext changes to clarify token/non-token creatures.,27,7,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/Scrolls/comments/1k5hs2/proposed_gametext_changes_to_clarify/,"Just did some testing with tychotesla ([replay](http://www.scrollspost.com/replay/5276125-0/atidwell-vs-tychotesla)).  The interactions between bounce and tokens is probably pretty common knowledge by now (because the game won't let you target tokens with bounce), but I think there could be some clarification in gametext to make it more clear.

Cards tested:

Bounce
--------
* Pushback
* Callback
* Divine Mark
* Metempsychosis

Tokens
--------
* Brother of the Wolf
* Rat King
* Forge
* Illthorn Seed
* Bunny
* Proximity Charge

None of the tokens can be bounced with callback or pushback.  You can't even target them.  However, you can target with divine mark - it just will kill the tokens when they bounce.

However, the first Proximity Charge summoned is not a token and can be callback/pushbacked (opposite of how rat king works).

Metempsychosis can be cast on any of the tokens just fine.

I propose Callback, Pushback, and Divine mark be changed to reflect the way they actually work:

Callback
----------
Target non-token unit you control is returned to your hand.

Pushback
----------
Target opponent non-token unit is returned to its owner's hand

Divine Mark
-------------
When enchanted creature is destroyed, it is returned to its owners hand. If it was it was killed by damage from another unit, that unit is returned to its owners hand.  Token creatures are destroyed if they would be returned to their owner's hand.

----------

That wording for divine mark might be better off as some kind of ""rulebook entry"", but since it only effects Divine Mark, might make sense to keep it just on the card.

~~I'd also propose that either Rat King generate one non-token and 2 tokens, or change Proximity Charge to generate 2 tokens, just to get their effects in-sync.~~  See gametext change recommendation in the comments below instead of modifying the mechanics.

So here's the plan. I need you to **reply to this thread** with a few of your details so I can start setting up tournaments.

1. I need to know your in-game name.
2. I need to know your rating.
3. I need to know your total games played.
4. I need to know at what times and dates you are available to play anywhere between 6 and 9 straight matches of scrolls in GMT.

This is so I can match people together with others of similar skill level to get some real fair competition going.
 
When I have a group of 4-8 players of similar skill levels together, I will PM you all on Reddit. From there, **you need to meet up in the chat-room ""TD""** where I will tell you who to duel. While it is not necessary for you to install the replays mod, it is really appreciated as I can possibly begin uploading these to YouTube with commentary in later weeks.

As far as the rewards go, the winner of the tournament will receive a rare scroll. The runner up will receive an uncommon scroll. The third place will receive two common scrolls and all other competitors will receive one common scroll. These scrolls can be any in the game and I will be donating them from my own personal stash or buying them on the market.

It costs me around 1900g-2500g to run one of these tournaments (depending on the number of players), so if you want to donate anything towards this, you can PM me on Reddit or usually find me in the chat-room ""TD"". **Donations are not mandatory**. Anything I get will go straight back into the community, so your donations will just help me run more tournaments.

I will be posting a thread for every tournament we run, unless this becomes so popular and I risk cluttering the subreddit.

I look forward to hearing from everyone and please all give a big round of applause to /u/monkyyy for winning the first tournament on Tuesday night.",,False,self,t5_2scq0,False,,flair-growth,True,t3_1h6b5s,http://www.reddit.com/r/Scrolls/comments/1h6b5s/scrolls_tournament_signup_no_buyin_rewards_are/,

1372010658.0,21,self.Scrolls,1gx2xn,Why people are against GO Draw and why Energy is deemed UP. My look at the situation,28,7,61,http://www.reddit.com/r/Scrolls/comments/1gx2xn/why_people_are_against_go_draw_and_why_energy_is/,"Ok, this is my analysis, so think about it as you like, I'm just telling you how I see the situation. If you disagree, that's fine, but come with agruments. 

Few things first though:

- My rating is around 1739 atm with mostly having played a Gravelock deck with growth splash. Now I use iScre4ms decklist though, as Gravelock is, while fun, not great in this meta. So I'm not the best player around, but I like to think I still know the game well enough to make a post like this. But like I said, this is my opinion, how I view the problem and what I think should be done about it.

- I don't view this game as in Beta, but as in early release. Why? Because there won't be a wipe (in rating or cards people have, at least I haven't heared that they will wipe the rating) and even after release the game will get balance updates. If this was beta there would be a full wipe, or at least a rating wipe (if people can find a source where they state that rating will be wiped, post it, because I can't find it)


Now, with that out of the way, let us start. Lately (well, since yesterday really) an issue got brought up about one deck that's becoming popular in ranked plays. That deck is GO Draw. For those who want to know more about go draw, go to this link and read it: http://www.scrollsguide.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1837&amp;p=18276. There are now people (mostly energy players, which I will get into) who won't play in ranked because of it. 

Now, why do people protest against this deck? Well, there are a few reasons (like it's beoring to play against for most people), but the biggest reason is that it removes energy viability and can still beat order and growth. Is it unbeatable? Nope. But the thing is, there are only a few counters against it, and those counters were either hyper agressive decks, which dominate the higher ratings, or other GO draw decks. This deck is strong because, once it survives the early game, it just gets stronger and stronger. That's why only agressive decks work against it. However, the decktype which really can't build a reliable agressive deck is energy. And guess which deck is deemed underpowered? Yep, energy, bringing me, to my next point: Why is energy deemed UP?

Energy has a lot of strong cards and has some of the best kill spells, like burn, Violent Dispersal and Thunder Surge. It is great at wiping the board and once it's ahead, it's very hard for others to make a come back. It's also very good at defending. However, energy also has major weaknesses. One is the most obvious, it's early game is very slow. This weakness Mojang tried to counteract by giving us Dust Runners, which are great and a good move. Suddenly, our matchup against growth is a bit easier. However, our second weakness, and this is a far bigger weakness than the slow early game, is card draw. Energy only has TWO cards that draw cards. One is burn, which like I said is a great card, but the other is clock library, a card that is so unreliable for card draw and so slow, it's only good once you're already ahead, which like I said earlier, Energy is already good at. Why is this a big weakness you say? Well, this game isn't just about board controll, it's also about card advantage. Even when you're behind on the board, if you have 5 cards in hands and your oponent is top decking, you have choices and can easily make a comeback. Forbiddian explains this very well in his video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSK-_HTNHko. 
And that's why energy is being deemd underpowered. For a game where having card advantage is so important (not just on the board but also in hand) Energy has a hard time getting that advantage. Also, cards that only draw one card, like foxes, pothers and kabonks, are really good because you are able to cylce through your deck to constantly have those cards in hand you need. So in my opinion, Energy needs either a new card draw card (which doesn't suck like library) or a change in library so it's far more reliable (maybe make it two turn cd) 

Now, back to GO Draw. Why didn't we see this deck before? One reason, and one reason only, it didn't have Noaidi. Because of that one card, GO draw has an easier time against growth and order decks (the card does almost nothing against energy, but like I said, energy already can't do much, if anything, against GO draw), meaning it is viable in ranked play, as growth is dominating the ranked. That doesn't mean GO draw can easily beat growth or order now, but it has a far better chance against it. So now there is a rise of players who aren't good, but because of this deck with so few counters, rise in the ratings, while good players see their ratings drop because they're not playing an agressive deck (mostly energy players, like iScre4m). 

But why don't people just change decks? Because a lot of people, like me, want to keep playing energy, as we find it more fun. And removing the viability of one whole colour isn't what I call good balance. And this is why a lot of people complain about this deck, even going as far as refusing to play ranked untill something is done. I'm not sure what I'm going to do, but I'll probably wait 'till Mojang does something to change this whole situation (and I hope it's soon). And Like I said, no, I don't see this as beta as rating doesn't get reset (unless someone proves me otherwise). 
There are situations where you can wait and see, but this is one of those situations where there needs to be an immediate reaction from the developer. And I get the feeling we'll have to wait for quite some time 'till something is done (please prove me wrong Mojang, please prove me wrong)

Edit: It seems they removed the ability for Noaidi to get growth, which I think is a great change. It should make Growth beat GO draw easier, meaning it becomes less of a viable ranked deck.

I am introducing my new tournament series so it's not a one time thing. It's more like a ladder tournament every 2 weeks. The system is kinda different so don't get scared off. Read about it, understand it and join the party.

Usually you guys participating on tournaments which are finished in one day based on a KO-System. This takes a lot of time and leads to frustration since it's only 1 game in the lower brackets, so a lot of people reserved the whole evening for this tournament and got busted in the first round. Well I decided to create some kind of round thing, every day we are playing one [BO3 \( Best of 3  \)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoff_format#Best-of-three_playoff). So, we are starting on **Monday ( 19.08.2013 6pm CET )** and playing the ""[Swiss-System](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss-system_tournament)"" it means I am creating the bracket every day at 6pm based on the last results. The moment the new bracket is live you have 22 hours ( 4pm the next day ) to provide a result ( 1-0, 2-0, 2-1 ). If I don't get the results in time I will tie the game. Within the first 3 hours after the bracket is live each player have to get in contact with his opponent to set up a date. If someone is refusing to contact his opponent right in time it's going to be a free win for him. These scenarios are all worst case the goal is a clean tournament flow without any trouble. So if there is someone making to much trouble, bad attitude, making people feel uncomfortable e.t.c, I don't hesitate to disqualify him instantly. So these is the summary of the whole system. I am going into details now.

__________________________________

**Start:** [19.08.2013 - 6.00 PM CET](http://www.timeanddate.com/library/abbreviations/timezones/eu/cet.html)

**End:** [28.08.2013 - 6.00PM CET](http://www.timeanddate.com/library/abbreviations/timezones/eu/cet.html)

**Entry Fee:** 1.500 Gold

**Mode:** Swiss-System 9 rounds - Best of 3

**Price:** 1. 50%, 
       2. 30%, 
	   3. 10%, 
	   4. 5%, 
	   5. 5% **+ I add 25.000 gold to the price pool**

**Room:** Meet in my channel Heimerdinger

**How to sign up:** Add me ingame ""Heimerdinger"" and transfer me 1.500 gold, you find me in my channel Heimerdinger as well.
_________
So these are the basic rules. Within the next 3 days I am coming up with some additional rules to guarantee a nice tournament experience for everyone. It was important for me to have 22 hours timetable for one Bo3 game, we have a lot of timezones in scrolls, mostly EU&amp;USA, so it's not that hard to find a date for the match.

You guys can bring up your own ideas or offer me help to organize it. Every match-day at 6.00 pm CET I am going to create a new reddit post with the updated bracket and at the end of the day I try to list up all replays in this post. **No matter which kind of rules / changes we add, the timetable will be the same.**

If the whole thing works well we make this every 9 days with a 2 days break between it.


Gogo give me your thoughts and ideas and let's create a great tournament series together.

I have been playing with and against it for a while now and IMO I think it is too good. It sucks the fun out of games for me even if I'm the one playing order. 

When playing with / against growth and energy the matches always feel really tense all the way through. When playing against order though you need to rush them like crazy as once they get to the late game and can play a few imperials it's GG. 

Since order have lots of crazy card combos they can just mass cards with 10-15 in hand at once. It then becomes impossible for either growth or energy to keep up as even if you do fair trades they can just keep playing more beefy units and combos. 

I'm not saying it's impossible to beat order or anything like that, but just that this card just makes it frustrating and not as fun as energy/growth matches. I think the game would play much better without this card. ",,False,self,t5_2scq0,False,,,True,t3_1jfnuu,http://www.reddit.com/r/Scrolls/comments/1jfnuu/is_imperial_resources_too_powerful/,

* Added Tier filters to WTS/WTB
* Added Tier prefix and Tier suffix
* Added Tier2 and Tier3 Multiplier
* Added Never Buy Maximum Total Owned
* Added Column-hiding for Tradeable and Tier1/2/3 on the Table view
* Updated resources to remove non-active sites and add new sites
* WTB/WTS settings now save to the server automatically.
* Theme setting now saves to the server automatically. Additional toggle added to Account screen.
* Switched Scrollpost pricing to use 72 hour price point and properly min/max the buy/sell prices.
* Fixed change password form not showing for some users.
* Alpha collection image-view (privacy controls and filters next release). /collection/AuctionBot (* case sensitive)
* Removed ScrollsPC and switched to ScrollsPost prices.
* Added ScrollsPost ""Suggested"" pricing option to WTS/WTB.
* Added Table Sorting Options.

* Added WTS/WTB append text.
* Added Remember Me option to login.
* Added WTS/WTB message-generation card filtering by resource-type.
* Added ability to do dynamic flash messages.

I'm looking for feedback on what kind of features/filters people would like to have to enhance the crafting experience and better streamline all the data that is now presented. As always, bug reports are very much appreciated.

The latest version of the CollectionSync mod can be installed from the Summoner repository, and will now sync tier information and tradeability.

I think it's clear to most that the game is in a bad state currently. I've only been playing for about 3 weeks, but even so I've noticed a kind of progression:

* Decline in the number of active players ([Drachenlord's post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Scrolls/comments/1i6o26/sub_10k_in_last_24_hours_whats_the_deal/))
* Lethargy from Mojang ([theoriginalak's post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Scrolls/comments/1ifdaz/how_do_we_tell_mojang_that_we_need_more/))
* Most recently, community contributors giving up on the game ([ScrollsPC](http://www.reddit.com/r/Scrolls/comments/1ikx9x/scrollspccom_no_longer_working_suspended/) and [trading.scrollsguide.com](http://www.reddit.com/r/Scrolls/comments/1ikx9x/scrollspccom_no_longer_working_suspended/cb5nsy1))

Of those the last one is **really** worrisome, and I feel that to be the real indicator that this game is dying. In a similar vein, I have given up on the game (for the time being) and will be moving on to other games (I'll especially keep a close eye on some of the competitors springing up, as I do enjoy CCG games a lot).

I'd still like Scrolls to do well, mostly because it isn't pay-to-win, and to that end I'd just like to leave a few comments before I go:

* The game itself has a lot of potential and is fun. Coming from a Magic background, I expected the positioning of units to irritate me, but it actually works really well. I also like the countdown mechanic and the cards being represented by board units;
* Unfortunately, while the game has a lot of potential, it is currently a *bad* game. This is mainly due to the lack of cards and lack of game modes, although some silly issues like frequent disconnects contribute to it as well. I realize it is still in *beta*, but please see my comments below regarding *beta* status.
* Mojang is not reacting to the problems in the right way at all. The common excuse seems to be that the developers are away on vacation, and being a developer myself I do not begrudge them some away time, but to do this shortly after you've released your game (expecting users to pay for it) is a very bad choice.
* The game is going to face stiff competition from the up and coming online CCGs, as well as Magic Online (initially I was torn between getting back into Magic Online or buying Scrolls).
* Scrolls could still prevail, though it seems less and less likely each day that goes by.

Word of mouth on this game has changed from ""you need to check out this awesome new CCG from the Minecraft guys"" to ""Scrolls is pretty stagnant, you should rather wait and see how the other online CCGs are doing.""

So what is needed to try and salvage the situation:

* A massive amount of material and communication from Mojang. They really need to look at companies like Riot and Wizards of the Coast to understand what is required here. Perhaps something like Mark Rosewater's old weekly design posts just to let the community know something is happening.
* Lots and lots of content, both scrolls and features. This won't happen overnight of course, but I doubt ex-Scroll players or new players will really start investing in the game again until it reaches some kind of critical mass. Decay won't be enough.
* Get out of beta, it's a crutch currently and is only irritating players.

I know this *advice* is pretty obvious, and has been posted here before, but perhaps the spin I want to put on it is **there is no quick win available to Scrolls any more, it is too late, and the best they can do now is hope to hit really strongly six months from now.** 

Decay won't make me come back to Scrolls, only if all my friends start playing it and it's on everybody's lips, then I'll give it a shot again. Scrolls' best hope is to release the bare minimum required for this game to be actually good, hold on to the die-hard fan base (which will be very small for the foreseeable future) and make a big buzz about the actual non-beta release. Even then I feel like it will be an uphill battle.

Lastly a short note about the crutch that is *beta* status. I bought this game without even realizing it was still in *beta* (it's not that clear on their website). The concept of *beta* has certainly evolved, likely ever since Gmail remained in near indefinite *beta*, and it is disingenuous to call a generally available, pay for, product *beta*. While perhaps technically correct, all I can say as a player is ""I don't care."" I paid for something which is of poor quality and as such I won't be playing it again until it proves, not that it has the potential to be good, but that it is actually good.",,False,self,t5_2scq0,1374234652.0,,,True,t3_1imhjx,http://www.reddit.com/r/Scrolls/comments/1imhjx/another_doom_and_gloom_post/,

Currently in the beta we've seen a 'scroll trickle' where a few new scrolls get added every 3 weeks or so. Scrolls is unique in this regard as this isn't really possible with tabletop card games. One downside about this method is that the meta game could shift instantly whenever a new scroll is added (as we saw with Noaidi) which would disrupt competitive play.

Another option would be expansions where a ton of new scrolls are released at once but the wait between expansions is longer. This would give us a lot of new deck options to play with at once, but there would be more downtime between new scrolls.

Which method would you prefer: the trickle, expansions, a hybrid of the two, or something completely different?",,False,self,t5_2scq0,False,,,True,t3_1ikhe7,http://www.reddit.com/r/Scrolls/comments/1ikhe7/how_should_new_scrolls_be_implemented/,

  IMO Thunder Surge needs a complete buff/reworking. The card does 2 damage to all connected units for 6 energy. It can be played around so easily and 2 damage isn't that much of a punish for connecting your units. Quake is better in almost every way except it effects your side as well and Speed + Mangonel does 3 damage to a diamond area and for 1 more order can be made to do 6 damage. Either Thunder surge needs to do more damage or lose the connecting needed for it to be good because atm you are almost better playing 2 IB's instead of using 1 Thunder Surge.

I also think cards like Ether pump and charge coil need to be able to be buffed so they can be some what useful. 1 Damage is not that important (especially vs order where most have 4+ Health) ",,False,self,t5_2scq0,False,,flair-energy,True,t3_1ii4sd,http://www.reddit.com/r/Scrolls/comments/1ii4sd/how_can_energy_be_fixed/,

There are much less 1900+ players playing ranked lately. This makes it much more difficult for people to climb the ladder, as you're usually matched against people with much less rating than you (once you're at 1800+ or so). The problem with getting matched against people 200-300 rating lower than you is that if you win the game you earn a paltry amount of rating (I've heard of Kritical receiving -1 for a win), but if you lose the game you lose a large amount of rating. Considering that this is a card game with a luck factor present in every match, it's quite possible to lose to a 1500 rating player and lose 24+ rating for the match. Therefore, to climb right now you need to win approximately 4+ games for every 1, which again is difficult given the luck factor in card games.

So we have a bit of a perpetual problem. High ranked players won't play ranked because they don't want to lose lots of rating to a low ranked player and mid-to-high ranked players don't want to play ranked because there's no higher ranked players to play against.

I think most 1800+ players are aware of this problem. I was watching a stream last night where a 1900ish player got matched against a 1500 player, and he just offered him 1000g to surrender the game so he didn't risk losing tons of rating. The fact that these kinds of things are happening shows that there's a definite problem. So how can we fix it?

The rating system itself should probably be adjusted. You should never receive -1 or +0 for winning a match, but it does happen. Losing a match should perhaps not negatively affect your rating as much as it currently does.

I think the above idea is pretty solid. However, some people were discussing the idea of rating decay yesterday and I think I like it, but I'm curious how other people think about it. Essentially the way it would work is that for every 24 hours without playing ranked, you lose some rating. 30 was the proposed number, which may seem like a lot but if it was something like 5 or 10, I feel that most high ranked players would just accept it instead of risking -25 from a ranked match. The point is to make the possibility of rating decay a worse option than potentially losing a ranked match, to get people away from sitting at the top of the ladder and into playing ranked more.

My thought is that this scrolls is great to deal with weenie decks. Just pick a lane you are losing, pop down decimation and watch the small ones go down. I could see it getting potential in an energy/order deck that's all about burns when there are more synergies between the different resources, but as of now 3 order is a bit of a high cost to splash it in an energy deck, in my opinion.

I'm aware that in the game it says you're guaranteed to get 2 uncommon and 1 rare in the 10 card packs and there was a dev confirmation that the probability split among random cards was 70%/20%/10% c/u/r.

My question is in the 10 card packs is it that you're guaranteed to get **exactly** 7/2/1 or **at least** 7/2/1? Can the common cards randomly be better or are you always guaranteed to get exactly the average distribution when you buy in bulk?

Also, is it worth it to buy the other starter decks? It seems on the surface that if your goal is to amass a large set of cards for building a variety of custom decks that the starter decks get you 50 cards for a larger cost than getting 50 random cards, so if you weren't dead set on particular colors and instead shooting for a variety would it even be worth getting the starter decks?

One last question - I heard they were planning on adding additional factions, is there any info as to when they might do that? Just wondering if it would be worth holding onto gold until another faction is released so I can get some of those cards as well.",,False,self,t5_2scq0,False,,,True,t3_1ggmkt,http://www.reddit.com/r/Scrolls/comments/1ggmkt/newbie_questions_is_there_a_difference_between/,

My suggestion is that there need to be some types of gold sinks in Scrolls to prevent gold from pouring in and packs from being bought and the cards in ""circulation"" continue to rise and decrease in value. This is something I feel strongly about and is related to tournaments but in the end there needs to be much more than that.

I see a tournament option and its greyed out obviously suggesting that tournament modes are in the works so my suggestion for a gold sink/tournament is a draft mode. This is not going to be THE gold sink to fix the gold problem altogether but as long as they balance the cost players pay in as more than what they are giving out it will help in the long run.

For those of you who does not know what a draft mode is, in Magic The Gathering a draft involves 3 booster packs where players open one at a time take a card pass to the left (or right) and keep doing this until all 3 packs are gone, then they make a (small) deck from the cards, play each other, get prizes (more packs), and keep all the cards. The winners got boosters and usually there were varying modes, such as single elimination (one loss and you are out) where the top winners got all the extra packs or a swiss (where everyone plays 3 rounds) and those with the most wins get more packs than those under but usually only the person who lost all 3 rounds gets nothing.

This mode would have an increased fee (above what the packs themselves cost + the prizes given out) to join due. This is my favorite type of tournament (in MTG) and I look forward to it in scrolls if the devs could work it out with a good deck size/number of packs/prizes and fees. I'm sure regular tournaments will also be in there where you bring your deck already made and play and the best get prizes but I love playing with decks you make on the spot.

 

If you are an MTG player, know what drafting is, or just think this idea is neat please speak up so the devs can see.

Someone in the thread on the forums also suggested sealed events as well which i stand behind as well. It would be a little harder with sealed because you don't get to pick all the X color or faction from many packs but it could still be tons of fun with the right deck size and number of packs.",,False,self,t5_2scq0,False,,flair-energy,True,t3_1fw5lo,http://www.reddit.com/r/Scrolls/comments/1fw5lo/gold_sinkstournamentsdrafting/,

1372970866.0,16,self.Scrolls,1hnkgq,Spiky rules.txt clarity and Mechanics Guide (A Spearman and a Wildling walk into a bar...),20,4,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/Scrolls/comments/1hnkgq/spiky_rulestxt_clarity_and_mechanics_guide_a/,"Hi all,

Had this experience today with a Ducal Spearman and a Wildling.

Currently, the spiky tooltip reads:
&gt;""When Ducal Spearman is damaged in combat, Ducal Spearman deals 2 damage to attacking unit.""

In my mind, since my Wildling at the time had 0 attack, it wouldn't be affected by the Spiky. This was not the case. Retroactively it can be justified, since the Wildling *did* do damage, that damage was just 0. But I think perhaps the wording should be changed to:
&gt;""When Ducal Spearman is attacked, Ducal Spearman deals 2 damage to attacking unit.""
for clarity. Or maybe this is not working as intended. 

In any case, a detailed official Mojang Mechanics Manual would be nice to see, and I think situations like this and other interactions (especially with spiky units) reveal a pressing need for such a manual, especially in the context of testing whether those interactions are properly functioning; this is a beta test, after all! As another example, in my experience with Mangy Wolfs and spiky units, an attacking Mangy Wolf with 3 health survives with only one health, while a Mangy Wolf with 2 health dies when attacking, so the Mangy Wolf's heal is neither applied before, simultaneous to, or after the attack. Is this working as intended, or is it a bug? More details on the mechanics of both traits would be helpful in making this determination, and while I understand that not every mechanic intended to be released is currently in the game and that many mechanics currently in place will not make it to release, I believe it is in the best interest of the game and the community to have detailed documentation on game mechanics.

To be useful, this documentation would need to detail:
*How precedence is determined when an ability interacts with other abilities.
*The actual source of the ability (eg. the dustrunner/efficiency dilemma)
*Any oddities which are not immediately clear from the text of the ability.
*Examples of the ability's function in normal and odd cases.

And, more generally:
*Basic mechanics (countdown, movement, sacrificing, 3 card max, etc.)
*Advanced mechanics (real health is removed before temporary health,  attack order when multiple units have 0 countdown, etc.)
*How disconnects are handled
*How the no-discard-pile works

Such documentation would help introduce new players to the game and, as stated above, help players know what is normal and expected and what isn't working properly. And while an official resource from Mojang would be optimal, even a community-created archive of various rules and mechanics experiments would be helpful in the interim.

**Intro:**

My favourite thing about card games is making new Decks and showing your understanding of the game by being able to value cards whenever something in the game changes. This doesn't work as well when people can just copy the top Decks. I'm going to be hosting a series of tournaments with special Deck building rules that mean you have to re-evaluate each card and show that you really understand the mechanics. 

**Prizes:**

1st: 2000g
2nd: 1000g
3rd: 500g

**Rules:**

***Special rule: No rares***

Once the brackets are up, everyone will be messaged on here &amp;/or Scrolls. For each round, you will have 24 hours to complete the match. If you do not complete it in this time, and I can identify one player as the reason for the match failing to happen (example: One player has been on constantly, waiting for the match, and the other has not been on at all), that player will be given a match loss. If not, both players will be disqualified and anyone who would have faced them in a later bracket will be given an automatic win. A replay of each game should be provided by the winner to prove the result.

The tournament is double-elimination, each match is a single game, except the finals are a best of three.

You do not have to submit a Deck-list, and can use a different Deck for every game, but must always obey the 'no rares' rule. 

**Misc:**

Here is a list of people's in-game name, followed by where you can contact them, R means that the username is for reddit, SG means it's on Scrollsguide.

**You have to be in the US**, we got enough active EU mods :p 

Your job will be to click approve on all the posts caught in the spam filter.

Write something in the comment if you're interested, with a photo maybe ? something like a bud light/american flag/eagle/burger/cheerleader in front of your screen with Scrolls running, that should do it.

Personally, I would like to see a larger amount of sacrificing, in the form of creatures that can eat others, being required to cast a scroll, or being a result of a scroll, like Golem Skin or end of Reason already do. Here are some of my ideas to that end, along with what I'd imagine decay's field wipe might look like.

Featured today is the Enchantment Death Cap Berserk

Death Cap Berserk - 3 Growth

Effect: When Death Cap Berserk comes into play, and at the beginning of its following turns, enchanted creature's Countdown is set to 0. At the end of these turns, it is dealt 2 damage.

In my opinion this scroll can be a life saver in a close game where every attack counts, simply because it allows your creature to attack every turn. The problem though is that you have to throw it on a creature with a bit HP, otherwise the poor thing will die within a turn. 

It's a high risk high reward scroll in my opinion, it could win you the game, or you just lost a scroll and a creature for being able to perform one measly attack.

I had a few ideas that might help new players a bit when starting out. Some of these could already be in the works. 

1. Specialize the Tutorial to your precon.

If you start out as order, the tutorial will teach you the basics of the game, and some basic strategies of your deck (perhaps after you beat the tutorial once, you can play it again as the other precons to learn their basic strategies, see their scrolls, etc). 
(perhaps if you want to go farther, you start out by only being able to play the tutorial and you don't finalize your deck choice until after completing the tutorial. For instance, you play the tutorial as energy and when you finish, you're given the option to stay with energy or choose one of the other two precons and play test them). 

2. Did Not Sacrifice Notification in the tutorial only.

I remember another player posting how it would be helpful for newbies to get a notification before ending their turn for so many ranks. Personally I don't think that players that opt out of ranked matches should always be treated as newbies, so I think that if you were to implement this feature, sticking it in the tutorial might be a good idea. 

3. Weekly Trials 

The trials are cool, but when you're done, you're done. I think it'd be cool if the game gave you 3 challenges a week (1 easy, 1 medium, and 1 hard, etc) they could be old ones or new ones.

I decided to save myself a bit of time by creating a script that averages their values and returns a nice rounded number for me to base my trades on. I import these numbers directly in to my Google Drive trading spreadsheet, and I don't have to constantly manually update it while going back and forth between various sites. I thought I'd share the latest data here in case anyone else wanted to make use of it.

Here's the sites I used:

* http://scrollsprices.com/
* http://scrollspc.com/
* http://trading.scrolls.pw/
* http://www.scrollsmarket.com/

And here's the results:

* [All four sites averaged.](https://gist.github.com/antonelli/ca84f3022d378a55fa48#file-all-four)
* [Just scrollsprices.com and scrollspc.com averaged.](https://gist.github.com/antonelli/ca84f3022d378a55fa48#file-best-two)

The first thing I noticed was just how outdated scrollsmarket.com was. The only reason I included it was because I often see people referring to it in trade channels - but the site it self hasn't been updated in over a week, and its values represent that - using Decimation as an example, scrollsmarket.com has it as half the current value:

        ""name"": ""Decimation"",
        ""value"": 680,
        ""value_at_25"": 675,
        ""value_at_50"": 700,
        ""value_at_100"": 700,
        ""source_scrollsprices"": 800,
        ""source_scrollspc"": 800,
        ""source_scrollbulletin"": 721,
        ""source_scrollsmarket"": 400,
        ""sources"": 4

The second thing I noticed was that, during good hours, the Scrolls Trading Bulletin (trading.scrolls.pw) was pretty spot on to the more formally controlled scrollsprices.com and scrollspc.com. The Bulletin looks to be a good source for live trend tracking, and I wonder what kind of history the creator might be keeping. During off hours though, the values can be off.

And finally I noticed that scrollsprices.com and scrollspc.com both follow each other very closely, and the differences between them are near negligible.

Anyway, I hope this data might be useful for some people. It was updated just a couple hours ago. Also if anyone has any other price listing sites that would be good to include, let me know.",,False,self,t5_2scq0,False,,,True,t3_1gqzg9,http://www.reddit.com/r/Scrolls/comments/1gqzg9/scrolls_trading_sites_comparisonaverage_in_json/,

I played an Order deck yesterday, and my opponent did a really good move that surprised me quite a bit.  I had a Wildling at one health and a bear claw'd Kinfolk Brave that had 2 health remaining.  My opponent cast flip and moved the Kinfolk Brave to a different tile adjacent to the Wildling.  Two things happened:

* First, the Wildling look another damage as if a new creature had been summoned near her and died.
* Second, the Kinfolk Brave lost the enchantment he was wearing and immediately died as if he had zero health.

The language on Flip just says only to move the target creature to another area on the board.  It says nothing about re-summoning the creature or removing enchants off the creature.

I've heard that Growth is strong throughout the entire game, and a vast majority of players use growth. I always lean towards the minority, so I'm suspicious of Growth, but if it truly is as good as everyone says, it might be worth going for.

For energy, I've heard that it is very weak early, and completely defense based. With few creatures, it's hard to win a game.

1370696663.0,15,self.Scrolls,1fx9v2,Trading for newbies. Some general things. And some early pricing history.,24,9,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/Scrolls/comments/1fx9v2/trading_for_newbies_some_general_things_and_some/,"Trading can be very valuable once youve beaten all the easy challenges, got some gold and some cards, and know the basics.

Especially if you play order and got some cards of other colors to trade, and you like to buy 10 good random cards for 1000.

---

- ALLCAPS IS BAD. Repeating more than 2x per minute is bad.

- Dont waste anyones time trading or browsing too much. Dont go into trades if you dont have a clear simple deal in mind or have a lot of gold to spend to add flexibility.

- Just join ""trading-2"" and ""trading-3"" and read the SELLING offers for 5 minutes. Please ignore the buying offers that are usually 75% of selling offers. A selling offer is barely ever a rip-off while a buying offer is sometimes put very low. After 5 minutes you are likely having a general updated idea of the most wanted and most traded card prices. i wont mention those here, only try to explain their causes.

- You can open the chat window and have the deck builder open to search for names if you think you have a wanted card.

- it makes much more sense to just say what cards you have to offer (without a gold price in mind, since the easiest trades are card for card trades). Because a potential buyer likely knows what he wants and what he can pay for it while a seller cant keep track of all his cards that easily.

- Order is the least played faction, growth ids the most played. Dont trade order and growth 1 on 1 because due to lack of demand in order cards order cards are cheaper.

- Common order cards sell for as little as 65 gold, sometimes someone eoffers them for 60 each but has many up to 5c that no one wants. You can usually still chose from a lot of different useful ones.

- The ability to chose a card does not cost extra. The price of a card is mostly set by popularity and demand. Most players buy random cards for 100 or 175 each. most players play growth and likely bought random growth cards.

- Common growth cards sell for 50-110 gold. Because everyone has some of them and some cards are just not bough by anyone as much yet.

- Having the same card 4x is useless to anyone. Any 4th or even more card of the same type indicates that no one wanted to buy this card for a long time, making this card worth a lot less. Selling one of 3 cards of the same type is usually good, because its likely increasing to 4. selling the second card should cost extra. Selling the only card of one type of a deck you play often is just a bad idea.

---

Why some cards most popular to be traded for a lot of gold instead of being valued less than 200:

- Kinfolk brave 1000-1600 - Because its a rare growth card that only costs 2 energy. This card is weak but its flexible and can cause a fast win or a risk a slow loss. Valuable for AI matches. Expect its value to rise for a while.

- Great wolf 600-1500 - because most players play growth with a wolf deck and its unlikely to change anytime soon. Do not trade this card too cheaply. 1500 is a reasonable price, 700 is too cheap to miss. This card is a newbies best friend. And we are all newbies for now. If you  can buy it cheaply its like investing in another currency that can likely be resold for a profit. Price may fall if people realize there is other things to do than play wolf decks.

- Kinfolk Jarl 500-800 - because its a rare expensive growth card, needed to survive late games with a growth deck. The more common troubles of growth decks in late games will become, the more expensive this card gets. Currently price is falling slowly. Traded more often because of the overvalued kinfolk brave.

- Speed 900-1100 - (I have no personal experience with this one, but many cards that decrease countdown timers have increased popularity and value).

- God hand 700-1100 - I have not much experience with this card. but its a CARD NAME and its a popular rare one whats still not easy to trade, causing its price to fluctuate while you always see an offer for it.

- Quake 800-1000 - rare card that does lots of damage to a horde of unbuffed units. This is a ward against wolf decks with rising demand.

- Honorable general - 650-750 - the only expensive Order-card. this is what it sells for. so dont trade it 1:1 for one of the upper cards. Thats unlikely a fair trade.

- Waking Stones - 500-650 - similar to Honorable general, difference is that this is  rare defense, more effective against energy-cards than against growth-cards. Traded less often because its defensive only and weaker agaisnt wolfes.

- Wildling 400-500 - Growth card that allows for some specialized PvP  decks with lots of buffs. Dont sell it cheap, wait till more people realize its early potential.

- Bombard 400-500 - Its rare but a specialized energy deck card. low demand decreased its value but its easily worth more to someone who has already 2 bombard cards and such a specialized deck. Expect falling prices.

1370410989.0,16,self.Scrolls,1fpefd,Tips from a seasoned MTG player adapting to Scrolls,16,0,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/Scrolls/comments/1fpefd/tips_from_a_seasoned_mtg_player_adapting_to/,"As the title would suggest, I'm a seasoned MTG player that has been anxiously awaiting the Scrolls open beta. I thought I'd share my findings in how MTG relates (or rather *differs*) from Scrolls for those players adapting from MTG. That said, this is *not* a tutorial on how to play Scrolls, I am going to assume you already know how to play. This *is* about how to play better and breaking yourself from MTG habits that end up hurting your performance rather than help.

So here are my tips, the general idea is in bold followed by some extra 'splaining.

**1. Scrolls is not MTG; don't get frustrated when you fail.** It can be quite annoying and humbling coming from MTG and doing rather poorly in Scrolls; especially to someone (like the Easy AI) who 'plays like a newb'. Remember, *you're* the newbie now, at least for a little bit.

**2. Do not hold on to scrolls in your hand unnecessarily, often discard (sacrifice) them for mana (resource) or draw two.** Yeah, it's tempting to hold on to ""that awesome guy"" scroll or ""the killer spell that you can play in 2-3 turns,"" but don't do it. What you need this turn can very well be the last thing you need next turn.

**3. Everything is played at sorcery speed.** Yes, there are no counterspells, no 'instants'. So remember to strategize properly during your turn, once it is the opponent's turn you are not allowed to act. This related to the second tip in that you should not hold on to control cards ""just in case"" (see tip #4 as well).

**4. Stop worrying about the graveyard.** The graveyard is recycled back into the deck you draw from automatically (and behind the scenes). Your creatures keep dying? You keep casting your 'good' spells? Feel uneasy discarding your 'awesome guy' for mana? Hate to discard that boomerang that you *know* you'll need just for two scrolls? Quit worrying. All of those scrolls will be reshuffled back into your library at some point and you'll see them again. Play what you need to play for the turn. Discard freely for mana/scrolls.

**5. Don't get cozy with your mana (resource) pool.** So you got 5, 6, or maybe even 7 resources and can play your highest casting cost scroll? Great, but don't stop discarding for additional resources yet. The battlefield can change quickly and many times you will have to play several creatures/spells in a single turn to gain the advantage again or simply stay alive. Shorting yourself because you 'had enough' mana before will only cause you to lose when battles get dragged out.

**6. Don't immediately play what you draw out of desperation or excitement.** You may be in a pinch and you draw a scroll that you know is going to help a good bit. Or maybe it's your favorite 'awesome guy' scroll. Think carefully before playing it, especially late-game when you have a higher resource pool. That one scroll might be helpful, but what about sacrificing it for two even better ones? Unless that single scroll is going to win the game for you that turn, I'd recommend discarding it for two more. I'd be willing to say 80% of the time the two you draw are better together than the single one you drew at first. Even if only one of the two you draw is good, you have a spare to discard next turn to prevent being faced with the same dilemma again. Now if both are good, do play them and repeat the discard procedure (see tip #4). If you have bad luck with this, it's probably more to do with your deck lacking consistency rather than your streak of luck.

**7. There is no sideboard so make sure your deck has some situational scrolls.** While there is no sideboarding, you should always take some scrolls that help with the 'what-ifs'. Considering any scroll that is useless at the time is worth a mana (resource) or two more scrolls, it doesn't hurt to pack some in. Now that said, don't overdue it and water down your deck with every possible scenario. There's no reason a deck should not have some removal, burn, control, or prevention if your type has it.

**8. Build cohesive decks and keep your scroll count low.** Unless you're building a 'funny deck', keep it at a maximum of 60 scrolls. The minimum is 50 and the low-to-mid 50s won't hurt either. The point is that your deck should start to 'loop' (once the graveyard is recycled) so that it is consistent. Having a variety of one-of-everything is only going to make your deck hit or miss (and probably more miss). Once you go over 60 you may start to see your deck perform worse in longer matches.

**9. Avoid 'multi-colored' decks until later.** I know it may be tempting once you get some of the scrolls and detect the synergy between Order, Energy, and Growth... but just don't. Let yourself get comfortable with the game, the playstyle, and a good scroll library built up first. 

**10. Utilize the benefits of your deck type.** Each type (Order, Energy, Growth) have certain play-styles which maximize performance of the deck. For example, a few human units for Order will give attack/defense bonuses to the entire row of friendly units. They also have several units that are 'spiky' and make great front-line defenders. Between those two aspects, you can tell formations are very important and moving around is key in an Order-based deck.

**11. Never gauge your deck's performance against the Trial matches.** Trust me, it's hardly an accurate representation of a match. I still speculate that there are 'rigged' calculators and whatnot for these compared to normal matches. Point being, I have decks have been proven to be excellent both in single and multiplayer but are absolutely horrid in many of the Trials. Want to know how your deck fares? Play the AI or someone, don't do a Trial.

**12. Use the trade channel.** At the heart of it all, it's a trading ~~card~~ scroll game. Whether you like to trade for collecting/completion, competitiveness, or simply just as a social thing -- do it. From my interactions it has been quite pleasurable. It's very easy to find what you are looking for and just as easy to trade away what others are seeking. Don't be afraid to trade using gold if nothing interests you or them, it's the only way to buy new random cards/packs.

**13. Sometimes, especially starting out, you lose because you lack the good scrolls.** While player skill and strategy does play a huge part of the game, having access to the uncommon and rare scrolls doesn't hurt. The starter decks do a pretty good job of giving you a place to begin, but there is always room for improvement. Also, having multiples of the more rare scrolls helps draw consistently. Fortunately, this phase doesn't last too long once you start buying additional ones and trading around for the ones you need. This is another reason I mention tip #9 early out.

Please remember that these are tips or 'loose rules', all may have exceptions to them and it is your job to learn when the exceptions apply. However, I can about guarantee you that if you follow these tips you will notice yourself playing much better.

RES highly recommended to view this. I have some more ideas, I just need to commit them to the scroll designer. 

[Magic Well](http://i.imgur.com/Jt6Mu83.png)

Pretty basic. We have a scroll that summons a creature for 1G and a scroll that summons a structure for 1O, so why not summon a spell for 1E. If we lived in a perfect world I'd move this card to Order and Summons to Energy.

[Bladegunner](http://i.imgur.com/jshniUl.png)

First of 3 creatures that appear in the Energy wallpaper that don't have a card. 

[Grenadier](http://i.imgur.com/LMs47sM.png)

I originally made her quite similar to the Storm Runner, but changed this when that scroll was shown. ""Fire Lobber"" adds a fire effect on up to 4 hexes in the standard lobber diamond range. It will deal 1 damage immediately to each unit in those hexes on the next turn, and continue dealing 1 damage to anything that stays in those hexes for 3 turns. It's essentially poisoning 4 hex tiles. I think adding board effects like this is something Scrolls should consider, and I already have plans for a counter card called Purge (1O).

She may be too powerful like this, so I'm considering changing her Attack to - (so her attack can't be buffed, otherwise things might get a little crazy with a Focus or Desperation).

[Machine Mage](http://i.imgur.com/AsKqTYn.png)

The offensive compliment to Machine Priest. I like this thing a lot. Not much more to say about it.

[Gale Runner](http://i.imgur.com/iAliFdF.png)

I came up with this before the Viscera Sage scroll was known about, which is a Decay creature that's quite similar. Again, not a lot to say about this card; I think it has the potential to be quite good for Energy if played correctly.

[Overheat](http://i.imgur.com/yCbXGx6.png)

This was supposed to be a complimentary card to Gale Runner to assist with Energy's ramp, but I'm not sure how viable it would be. Ideally you put it on a Destroyer that you don't need anymore, that way you get 2 Energy for 2 cards but 1 of them presumably was no longer serving a purpose (kind of like a Fertile Soil). You could also put it on a Hellspitter Mortar to get 3 Energy for 2 cards. It's really easy for your opponent to counter, however. This should probably add some Attack to the structure as well.

[Death Ray](http://i.imgur.com/8GuH5Ge.png)

I simply made this because I thought the concept was really cool and totally fit the theme of Energy. Again, I made this before Decay was put on test, but it ended up being really similar to the Puppet Soldier + Nutrition combo. The biggest difference is that this thing does not just work instantly, so it can be countered. Also you can potentially get better trades with it, but it's very counterable (kill it before it goes off or move out of the lane). It's removal and board control all in one, so it fits well with Energy regardless of its viability.

[Oathsworn](http://i.imgur.com/SJMtMRN.png)

Fairly self-explanatory.

[Wartime Conscription](http://i.imgur.com/hDHfOpb.png)

This came about me trying to come up with a clever Order-themed ""comeback card"" that's not Mangonel (btw, I'd like to see Speed only affect creatures please Mojang). I've changed this quite a bit, and have considered added temporary +1 Order for each creature that was destroyed as well, to essentially counter mass removal such as Quake or Necrogeddon. Maybe it's not needed, but it seems like the other factions all have some sort of ""oh crap, this is going badly for me, let me play this card that gets me back in the game.""

[Knight Crusader](http://i.imgur.com/0Fn7tId.png)

So, I thought this guy on the Order wallpaper was an unreleased creature like the Energy ones, but apparently it's just the Knight Scholar. Regardless, this is a card that does things. I like the powerful Order creatures that affect other creatures around them, so I made this.


That's all I have in card form right now. I'm also considering a scroll called Reckoning that costs 7O and gives all friendly creatures Slayer until end of turn. It would essentially be Order's God Hand but would probably also require a General - Speed combo and it would be more of a board clear than God Hand's game finisher.",,False,self,t5_2scq0,1375021467.0,,flair-multi,True,t3_1j7qw9,http://www.reddit.com/r/Scrolls/comments/1j7qw9/since_were_sharing_our_ideas_for_new_scrolls_today/,

I love this game, and i love to see all the communities around it. However, it has come to my attention that around here, several high ranked players just love to dominate everything, Acting like they are the only people who's opinions matter. Whenever someone who is not high ranked would like to pipe in, they are shot down and told they do not have the knowledge or ability to interact in these discussions. Why is this? I realize that if you are higher ranked, you might know more in depth things about the mechanics. However, this doesn't mean that others cannot put in their opinions on the balance of things in low ranked play.

It kept me engaged for several evening gaming sessions as I worked through the single player missions/trials/whatever. By the time I finished them, I had earned like 5 booster packs from unlocking achievements in the various missions, and accrued enough gold or whatever to buy ""The Big Box"" of like 120 cards (10 boosters). So after a few days, not that much time, and spending no real money, I have like 15 packs of boosters to mess around with for deckbuilding.

Cut to Scrolls being released. I figure cool- I trust Mojang, it's not free to play, but I'm willing to spend $20 on something from a developer I feel like I can trust to get things right. Several nights later, I'm not sure how I feel about this. I like the gameplay style better, feels a a little more like a war/board game with the additional positions, little pieces, gaining resources requires sacrifice, etc. but I feel like I'm more or less stuck with my starter deck as I try to slog through the single player trials, which I don't know maybe I am just awful at this game but they seem quite hard with just the (Growth) starter deck and the few cards I've been able to purchase. I've beaten the Easy missions and it's feeling like the cards I have are not going to let me progress any farther.

**Basically I feel like I got similar amounts of time with DoC and Scrolls where I reached the ""my cards aren't good enough, do I grind easy AI games or spend real money"", but with Scrolls, I've already spent real money.**

I'll stick with Scrolls since I'm obviously already invested at least somewhat, and I know it's a beta, etc, etc but as a newbie I haven't felt a lot of the satisfaction that you want to feel a little ways in that makes you feel like you've made some progress from where you started.

That said, I haven't played Scrolls against real people yet, I did play one or two DoC matches against real people because it gave me achievements or something to buy the big booster box.

**Am I just awful at Scrolls or has anyone else experienced this?**

edit: Boldness for the TL;DR crowd

update: Just spent the 2000g given in today's patch to buy up in-faction single scrolls. Huge difference. Deck is getting more consistent and therefore more fun to play because I feel like winning has to do with my deck composition and not just the luck of the draw (as much).

Confirmed by Mojang.)",16,2,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/Scrolls/comments/1khppf/why_it_feels_like_the_ai_cheats_incidentally_it/,"I came across a VERY interesting article some days ago that blew my mind.  It was regarding the game 'Puzzle Quest 2', in which people often suspected the AI of cheating like a miserable beast.  No quantity of developer denials would totally convince them that there wasn't some cheating going on.   

To convince people the AI wasn't cheating, in in-house testing, the AI had to LOSE 3/4 of the time.  

Now, for Scrolls.  There's a sensation in many of the levels that the AI *is* cheating.  Plenty of us have felt it.  Awww, man, he drew that Speed RIGHT when he needed it to sweep the board...you know?  

http://www.reddit.com/r/Scrolls/comments/1kg35p/has_anyone_confirmed_whether_or_not_the_ai/cbowiyd

The AI doesn't cheat.  It just operates intelligently with what's available.  So why does it feel like it does?  Inherent distrust of computer systems built into the psyche?  

Maybe, I've got a theory.  

The computer doesn't look like it takes time to *think*.  As players, we make a move, see what happens, then make another move.  It's how the human mind operates.  The computer plans all of its moves on a given turn ahead of time, then makes them all at once.  It may take it 10 seconds to make those plans (especially when the board is full) but once it starts moving, it all happens very quickly.  

That produces the sensation that the computer isn't reacting to changing situations, like a person would.  It's just got the answers right in front of it, as someone would if they were...well...cheating.  This was especially evident in Puzzle Quest, where the AI would instantly make another move when given a second turn, rather than digging around the board like the player was forced to.

Even though the game is still in beta with a small amount of cards, I am already having trouble keeping up with the more active and hardcore players in terms of cards. I typically get beaten in multiplayer, and it is making the game repetitive for me; as long as I don't win, I cannot buy new cards. The alternative is to play *a lot* of losing or AI games and slowly build up my gold. This is... not very fun.


**The Idea**

I'd like to see a small gold reward for players during downtime. This would help players that don't play often still earn gold for cards. For example, for each hour a person is not playing a game, 2% would be added to a ""bonus gold"" bar, up to a maximum of 200% after 100 hours. This percentage would be applied as a bonus to the gold earned from the next *winning* game the person plays.

For example, if I did not play Scrolls for one day, I would have a bonus of 48%. If I won a quick match and earned 200 gold, I'd also get a down time bonus of 96, for a total of 296 gold. My ""bonus gold"" bar would then be reset to zero. This bonus would not start rising until I had not played a game for a hour.


Many MMOs do this (WoW, LotRo) with exp to help more casual players keep up with the more hardcore people. I think this would help the feeling of accomplishment and competitiveness in Scrolls. Players would also be encouraged to use up that 200% bonus once it was reached, too.

Note that all of these numbers could be changed to be balanced. Thanks for reading.",,False,self,t5_2scq0,False,,flair-energy,True,t3_1jxu77,http://www.reddit.com/r/Scrolls/comments/1jxu77/leveling_the_playing_field_an_offline_gold_bonus/,

One feature in games that I always appreciate is the ability to colorize your units (like Dawn of War or Street Fighter x Tekken).  A color wheel and the ability to colorize portions of clothing, fur, armor, weapons, etc. always gives me the feeling that I have my own unique army/units.  

It can even be something unlocked by some sort of experience system (play the card a certain amount of times and unlock the ability to manipulate the unit's colors on the field of play).  

I dunno, I'm such a sucker for things like that.  I can see myself running a Black/Purple themed Growth deck like no tomorrow.  Just an idea I've had, maybe some of you share the same passion for creating a sense of identity through mechanisms such as this.

I realize purchased skins are usually used as a solid source of revenue, but this can work hand in hand with that system if the custom skins are made customizable as well (a la Street Fighter x Tekken).

If people are worried about things like ""Pink army"" as mentioned below, they could use a bunch of set colors or allow for players to turn custom color visibility off.

I wanted to tell the community about some new stuff that should improve the lives of everyone.

ScrollsPC now offers Live Prices that have been collected from the actual trades that happened ingame. People can submit incorrect info on a website, and people can write incorrect info in a chat room, but when the actual Trade is going on the participants are going to use prices that actually are accurate. 

These Live Prices are collected with the ScrollsPCHelper. ScrollsPCHelper is a plugin that allows you to check prices ingame with chat commands and also sends anonymous data to ScrollsPC (things like what scrolls were used in the trade and how much gold was used). Note, that the data is anonymous and there is no way for me to get access to your password or anything personal like that. If you don't believe me the mod is open source, so you can check it out :)

More info - http://scrollspc.com/forum/showthread.php?tid=4&amp;pid=4

Oh and ScrollsPC now has a community forum with the biggest Trading category out of all Scrolls communities. The forum is also tied in with the website account, so you don't need two accounts. Go and check it out - http://scrollspc.com/forum/ :)

Just wanted to let you guys know, since the mod is up on Summoner, but most users don't even know that the prices used in the plugin are actually taken from actual live trades.

**Idea 1:**

- *Flying cards:*  Owls, Birds, Wyverns, you name it.  What does the flying trait do?  Make you immune to any ground based spells and tile effects.  Which bring us to 2 and 3.


**Idea 2:**

- *Ground Effect:*  Tack this onto cards where it makes sense such as binding roots and quake and other effects that shouldn't logically affect flying creatures.


**Idea 3:**

- *Tile effects:*  This idea came mostly from posting a Fire Deck Idea in one of the other posts.  Basically Tile effects are effects that stay on the board for a certain number of turns that only affect an enemy while on that tile.  This could be used for zone control and could even have charges.  

Possible cards could include cards that add a sticky substance that prevents a player from moving for a turn when they move onto the spot and gets used up, burnt ground that burns opponents while they are on the tile, poison tiles, tiles that increase max cooldown while on it, etc.


**Idea 4:**

- *Burn Effect:*  This came from my fire deck idea, but burn could be similar to poison except it generally is a shorter duration and does -1 damage per turn/on application and reduces attack by 1 as well while debuffed.

Woop woop. People liked it, so I kept working on it. Added all cards for Order and Growth. Energy coming tomorrow. 

Added an explicit filter by resource and one for rarity.

Added two different ways of viewing cards: small cards with gallery view (default, lower bandwidth solution) and big cards (lots of bandwidth used! For the extravagant among us).

I won't link the second one here. It's linked in the first link.

What other features should I add?

What are some scrolls that you think are great but for some reason people do not include them in decks?

I've been working on a really fun Energy/Order deck and two scrolls that have really helped me keep the deck running smoothly are [](#heritage) and *Clock Library*. It's even more fun to combine these two and draw **five** cards when it hits zero countdown. Even if destroyed prematurely that's at least **two** cards.
  
In my Order deck I really like *Divine Mark* which I rarely see played as well. It doubles as a save for your unit and an attack negation, which is great against relentless attackers. Not to mention their unit must be replayed, which can really slow them down if it was something big like Iron Ogre/Cannon Automaton/Jarl/Great Wolf. For 2O cost, how can you beat that?
  
Another is [](#powerbound) which I see used occasionally in mono-Order decks but I think it really shines in decks where Order is not the main faction. In my combo deck it really helps me ramp up Order without it getting in the way of my hand-sacrificing decision. Again, with the Clock Library it's pretty neat. Most turns I have 1O sitting around doing nothing for me so this is a no-brainer unless I desperately need the cards (hence the second paragraph).
  
Lastly, [](#hornofages) has won me the game several times. Rooting your opponent for an entire turn can prove to be exactly what you need both offensively and defensively. Forcing their creatures to waste an attack on an already-broken idol or rendering them unable to move in to defend their last idol.",,False,self,t5_2scq0,1370852203.0,,,True,t3_1g18t7,http://www.reddit.com/r/Scrolls/comments/1g18t7/underrated_underplayed_scrolls_share_your_thoughts/,

I had only a couple of units and hadn't touched any of his idols. I really wanted to resign but I know how amazing comebacks can be so I stuck with it. Soon enough (15/20 rounds) we were on even footing, and I had taken out one of his idols. I got some extremely lucky draws, things like pushback and frost wind, which kept me barely alive. He only had seven resources which meant I could use pushback on his important units to keep him at bay for another turn, and eventually I got one idol (the second) down.  
  
At this point we were still pretty even, I had two idols with 5 and 6 health while he had the top one with four and the third with ten. On one turn I had my 3 units, xbow, Ducal infantry, and a royal vanguard on the third row, all with 0 countdown, which left my second idol completely open with 6 health. I ended up taking out his third idol in one turn, leaving just the first one with 4 health.  
  
Two turns later he had a copper automaton on the top row and my units were still sitting on the third row. I had no idea what I was going to do with about twenty seconds left when a plan popped into my head. I used flip to send his automaton to the bottom row then I put roasted bean potion (ha, coffee :P) on my xbow and used speed to set his countdown to 0, then moved him to the top row and won. It was a very sweet victory. Here's the post game screen: http://i.imgur.com/ss0Vi8p.jpg

First of all, I absoultely love the game artstyle and music. This is one of those rare games where I can listen to that one combat tune over and over and over for hours on time.

Second, this is pretty much my first TCG, and I found this game to be fairly easy to learn.

Third, it would be REALLY nice if there was a ""friends"" -list option, so that I can find friendly and nice people afterwards. Also related to this, there should be a ""whisper""/""tell"" -system so that it's easier to make deals on trade channel for example.

Fourth, there seems to be two disconnect bugs. First, on a certain map (""marsh""? dunno, wet and foresty) occasionally game doesn't start at all (freezes before cards appear) and it ends in my victory, as if enemy surrendered. Second, I've had someone disconnect and game timer count down to 0.. the person reconnected just seconds before that and.. nothing happened. No timeout, game didn't continue etc. I was winning, and my only option was either to restart game or surrender.

Fifth, there really should be a ""join existing game"" -option in case I have to restart Scrolls for some reason. The bug above for example.

1376419979.0,14,self.Scrolls,1kangi,Decay Deck Theorycrafting / Discussion,16,2,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/Scrolls/comments/1kangi/decay_deck_theorycrafting_discussion/,"Since the devs have stated that they feel Decay is fairly balanced and we'll be seeing it on the main server soon, I'd like to get some discussion going about Decay deck composition. 

Here are the cards I feel every Decay deck will run:

* 3x Brain Lice
* 3x Damning Curse
* 3x Ilmire Hunter
* 3x Ilmire Rot Eat
* 3x Ilmire Witch Doctor
* 3x Infectious Blight
* 3x Languid
* 3x Lumbering Muckhead
* 3x Oblivion Seeker

I'm sure some people will probably disagree with those cards being must-haves, but to me it really serves a core of powerful creatures, draw power, and removal. This leaves 27 cards to round out a deck (a couple other cards like Blightbearer will probably be in 90%+ of decks as well but I omitted them from this list because I could see some people not playing them).

From here I feel there's three ways that Decay can go:

**Standard**

[Mock-up](http://www.scrollsguide.com/deckbuilder/#6933)

I call this standard because it functions most closely to the current competitive decks we have now. It's very creature heavy. Your goal here is to essentially play normally. You play creatures when you can to kill your opponent's creatures and keep board control. Tethered Recruit could potentially be replaced here, but it's such a strong way to gain the Order for Pothers/Transpositions. Viscera Sage could be played instead. Soul Steal can be considered for potentially replacing Transposition, as it's a form of removal but also has synergy with your deck as a way to kill your own creatures (it's great on Tethered Recruits).

**Poison**

[Mock-up](http://www.scrollsguide.com/deckbuilder/#6904)

This deck includes Mangy Rat, Miasma Well, and Mire Curse to maintain board control via poison damage. The goal of this deck is to always have at least a couple Miasma Wells to boost your poison damage. Infectious Blight is really important here, and it will require some attention to make sure the Blight stays active on your opponent's board. This deck does not contain the Puppet Soldier / Nutrition combo, which may be a mistake, but the exclusion of Soldier and inclusion of Summons effectively means you have 6 Miasma Wells in your deck to make up for how vulnerable and necessary they are for this deck to function. Infected Gravelocks are a possibility for additional poison damage, but I don't feel they're viable unless Mojang changes their Move 0. It's just way too easy for your opponent to play around them currently. If you do decide to use Infected Gravelocks, I'd recommend also running 3 Transpositions for surprise attacks. Pestis could also actually work in this deck as well. Even under the worst conditions (Pestis unit dies immediately) you gain 1 Mangy Rat for 3 Decay as long as you play it when you're about to kill something.

I'm really interested in seeing how this deck will do after watching Blinky vs. Rastien's 60+ round game. Blinky was playing Order and was winning the game, but Rastien played Mire Curses on all of Blinky's Mangonels that were on the field. As Rastien had Miasma Wells active, there were very few tiles where Blinky could play units without them just dying immediately to the Mire Curse. Poison decks should be really strong, but the games will probably be the longest of any Decay deck type. It will also most likely have trouble in the Decay vs. Decay match-up, unless Miasma Wells are changed to only affect your own poison. Otherwise, this style of play could backfire on you quickly.

**Direct Idol Damage**

[Mock Up](http://www.scrollsguide.com/deckbuilder/#6936)

Probably the most interesting deck type of them all. I also had to contradict my ""must play Decay card"" list and remove Brain Lice and 1 Infectious Blight to fit everything here. Once again, no Puppet Soldier/Nutrition which may be a mistake, but this deck is similar to the Poison deck in that it relies heavily on a single structure, and this time it's Totem of Suffering. This deck has a little less removal / control than the others, so you do risk your opponent just running away with the game. The objective here is to keep as many Totems of Suffering alive as possible. Whenever your creatures die, that's 1 idol damage for every Totem you possess. Every Loyal Darkling you play on the board is guaranteed to do at least 3 direct idol damage as long as you have just one Totem in play. Get all 3 Totems on the board and now each Loyal Darkling does 5 direct idol damage. Also consider I'm running Soul Steal here, so a Loyal Darkling + Soul Steal can deal 5 damage to an idol, and then summon another weak creature that can be subsequently killed for even more idol damage. There are some really interesting possibilities here, and it'll all be about toeing the balance between letting your opponent kill your things but not letting them just overpower you completely. Hex Marks could be played for more idol damage potential, although I'm not sure if it's reliable enough to be included. It would probably be great after a Necrogeddon, and could ensure a win. The possibilities of playing Necrogeddon with 3 Totems of Suffering on the field to just insta-win games is a bit mind blowing.

If we can attack a magma pack to an enemies unit why not use metempsychosis too? It also would shift some of the viability of aggressive growth order.

It would not replace purify, but it would give options. It is also 3 order so it is not exactly the easiest to splash either so I don't think the cost would make it as simple as that.

Neither of those work out to 300+ gold for a winning game though. If I win a game (m=20 and 20i = 60) that took approximately 20 minutes (t=1.5), I should only get either 90 or 120 gold.

[Whinge],18,6,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/Scrolls/comments/1g1oqz/where_is_the_bomb_for_order_whinge/,"I find that in a lot of games that go late order is quite a strong deck, yet relies on good play and board presence.  Yet lacks the high cost card it desperately needs. Imperial resources makes sense thematically and yet, in practice, seems to fall short. What I mean by this can be seen by comparing equivalent 7 cost cards in the other clans.

Godhand is literally a ""win now"" button in any sort of reasonable growth deck. Once late game arrives growth's aggro peters out and yet no problems! Win with Godhand. 

Energy wants the late game to arrive: it walls out its opponent, establishes board control and then follows up with strong cards such as Iron Ogre and Cannon Automaton. 

Yet, Order has none of this. It's high cost cards have no immediate reward. General takes 3 turns to warm up. Even with Speed in hand that's a 9 resource sink for what is really a 2 card, bad, Godhand. 
Then the 7 Cost? Imperial Resources. No comeback mechanic, no applicability in most situations. It's even bad sometimes when you *are* winning. Just 2 card draw and a small global heal.

So my question to this subreddit is: What would make Imperial resources good? What sort of numbers? Alternatively what sort of thematically fitting design would give Order the bomb it needs?
And really lastly (On a whingier note): Why does Growth get both kinfolk brave AND godhand AND Fertile Soil. It has the late game of Energy, the aggression of Growth and then the best draw spell in the game!

Some decks splash a second color for 1 drop spells (often order) and there are some draw/ramp decks that can actually works with multiple colors but it ends here.

**The reason (you can skip this if you want):**

For each resource you more or less have to sacrifice scrolls effectively putting you at a scroll disadvantage. With 6 resources of a color you can play nearly every card of your deck already if it is monocolored. If you have a 2 colored deck and want to play only 5 cost cards of both colors you have to actually sacrifice 10 cards already to play your whole deck and you still might get screwed if you draw the wrong scrolls and don't have the relevant resources yet. It is a double disadvantage and thus not viable. The only effects that currently support multicolored decks a bit more are resource gainers but in the end those still will cost you scrolls or atleast slow you down hard. With the current system it will NEVER be viable to do a complete 50/50 split into 2 colors unless there are some ridiculous combo cards available.

**The possible change:**

What if instead of 5 resources of a kind scrolls would cost 2x+3 for example (2 resources of a kind + 3 times any resource)? It would instantly increase deck variety by a huge amount. I don't see a reason not to do this (beside having to put a lot of reworking into the existing cards but hey .. it is still beta). There still could be true monodeck scrolls that cost 5x etc because they are supposed to be very limited to a specific color.

**Discussion:**

You could say this change would make Scrolls more similiar to traditional TCGs like MTG but let's face the truth. There is a reason they chose this superior resource system there and in many games. Right now deck variety is very limited in terms of multicolor choices which isn't exactly a small problem given there are only 3 (4) different colors out yet. It is still not too late to do this massive change and I'd say better now than never.

So what is your opinion? For me lack of deck variety is the #1 reason why I don't play this game more than I do.

Thank you to all you guys for the awesome comments and suggestions, I've incorporated (very nearly) everything that was suggested, a few of them being: Card tooltips, full sorting on tables, [better filters](http://www.scrollspost.com/pricing/order-growth/rare/1-day/buy-popularity-desc), [generic card search](http://www.scrollspost.com/scrolls), [pricing graphs](http://www.scrollspost.com/scroll/34/quake/market), [trade chat logs](http://www.scrollspost.com/pricing/chat).

Seriously, the suggestions were great! If you have any more or something you want to see, just let me know.

---

One of the things I noticed, was that a lot of people seem to run stores out of game. Which is kind of tedious since you have to manage pricing, what you have available, it doesn't auto update and so on. To try and make the process less effort, ScrollsPost now supports user stores that integrate on various points of the site with auto syncing in-game.

[Here](http://i.imgur.com/WFMi0Bk.png) is an example of the store management UI, you can auto price items as well as quickly set quantities using filters such as ""Keep 3 of everything I have, sell rest"". Quantities are all automatically managed too. If you say you want to buy 1 Imperial Resources and sell 2 Quakes, if you gain an Imperial Resource and a Quake in-game, it will automatically adjust your store so that you are no longer looking for an Imperial Resource, and only need one more Quake.

---


You can view [my store](http://www.scrollspost.com/store/10qe4g6c0ro490zfr003/shadowed) for example, which shows my in-game name and a channel you can reach me by, as well as what I'm selling or buying. Speaking of, I could use 3 Great Wolfs right now, so if you have some, let me know.

There is also a dedicated page to get an overview of what's for sale or purchase on [card store](http://www.scrollspost.com/pricing/stores), or on individual card pages such as [Great Wolf](http://www.scrollspost.com/scroll/38/great-wolf/store).

Card syncing requires the ScrollsPost mod, which you will need [Summoner](http://www.scrollsguide.com/summoner) for. Besides that, just great an account in-game (or on ScrollsPost) and it will automatically sync your card changes whenever you get a new card, trade on away and so on.

**Subreddit Link:**  /r/ScrollsLL



**What is Scrolls Ladder League?**

Scrolls Ladder League is a league that consists seasons that last 2 weeks long. It is made up of multiple ladders(or divisions), where players play against scheduled opponents from their ladder in order to decide who moves up, who remains in the same division and who moves down.

The ultimate goal is work your way up the Ladders and to win Ladder 1. Winning Ladder 1 makes you that particular season's Grand Champion.

At this time, we're deciding on how to work out rewards for Grand Champions and each individual Ladder's champion. Entry fees, in gold, are being considered. Season 1 we're looking to make there be a 100g entry fee per player. Does that sound okay? You would pay the entry fee to me(Pizzarony In-Game) before the Season began.

**How an Example Season Would Go:**

Pizzarony, JoeSchmoe123, BillyBob, NoScopexX420Xx and GruntMan111 are in Ladder 1. They all play 2 games against each other(may change depending on # of participants). Pizzarony ends up with a perfect 6-0 Record. BillyBob comes in second place with a 4-2 record. NoScope finishes 2-4. And GruntMan finishes 0-6. Pizzarony, in this case, would be the Grand Champion, or winner of the League's top Ladder. But say if these were results for Ladder 2, Pizzarony would then move up to Ladder 1, while BillyBob and NoScope remain in Ladder 2, and GruntMan moves down to Ladder 3. 

Make sense? Good. (If you need further explanation, PM me.)

Sign-Ups for Season 1 of the Scrolls Ladder League are open now! Please visit [THIS LINK](http://www.reddit.com/r/ScrollsLL/comments/1gdo66/officialscrolls_ladder_league_season_1_signup/) to sign up.

It's a work in progress, and I'm sure some things will be tweaked here and there. If you have suggestions, PM me!

Picked up Scrolls last night after watching some game play vids.  Love the game so far, but I can't help feeling like I'm missing something about how a battle progresses.

I picked the Order starter deck because I like the whole look of the troops.  Figured I'd play, get the hang of it and work up to purchasing the rest of the starter decks and see which I like the most.

Anyway, the title of this post is pretty much the TL;DR.  My paltry record so far is 4/7.  I normally can win against Growth, but when it comes to Energy I tend to get crushed (not to say that I dominate vs Growth.  I squeak by sometimes.)  Seems like Energy relies on mostly on range, yet the bulk of my Order deck is melee.  Crossbow guys seem like some sort of answer , but it's amazingly hard to hold any kind of position what with all the area of effect explosions mixed with the guns.

I started battling the Easy Trials and got shut down.  Moved to the quick match against Easy AI and got shut down, but not as bad.  I feel like I shouldn't have to employ a crazy technical micromanagement style of disperse/clump up this early on.  I surely don't expect to win every match, and I'm ok with my record so far.  I just feel like there's something integral to the Order playstyle that I'm completely oblivious to.

Are there certain cards in the starter deck that I should strive to replace immediately?  Do I need to just give the game more time to find my rhythm and get comfortable?  Are there certain pitfalls that i should be avoiding with Order?  Is it just a matter of game balance?  

I'd really like to get better and get more enjoyment out of the game.  I hope you guys and gals can help point me in the right direction!

People are going to max out on commons first (I'm maxed out on most of my useful commons), then uncommons, then rares. 

Since there are 29 rares, after 87 cracks we're going to have (at least on average) as many rares as anyone could want.

So here's a few steps to bettering your scrolls experience through trading, and an additional website to check out all things scrolls, including the mod-loader (which is legal to use in game). 

* Ok first since I didn't see this on the sidebar, there's a website called [scrollspost](http://scrollspost.com). Go to this to learn the average price of how much a card sells for (if you'd like to do this manually). This website only serves as a guide to learn what a card has/can go for as the gold going rate can vary person to person. 

* Next,  there's [scrollsguide](http://www.scrollsguide.com). Here you can do many useful things such as post in the forums, view user created content, join draft tournaments, and most importantly download the summoner mod-loader.

*Now, here's the most useful thing you will get by reading this if you don't already have it downloaded. [summoner](http://www.scrollsguide.com/summoner). All you have to do is download this from scrollsguide, and you'll gain access to many useful user created mods (once again, completely legal) in-game, such as a Game replay feature, a collection sync for another website called [scrollstoolbox](http://scrollstoolbox.com), etc, but the main thing discussed in this post again being the in-game price-checker that takes data from scrolls-post and you will see them during your trades. 

Now, of course trades aren't determined by this website solely. You still have the willpower to dictate if you want to sell/buy for more or less than that price. I'm only here to help out those that are completely unsure with prices, and would like a general idea what to pay/sell for in the trading channels by saying the terms ""WTB"" &lt;card name&gt; or ""WTS"" &lt;card name&gt;. If you don't have the mod-loader I suggest getting it because it offers many great features that the devs don't have time for or aren't focused on atm that were implemented by the community instead. This isn't to get back at power-traders in any way, and I'm not here to argue about what's right and what's wrong. 

All I'm doing is offering help to anyone new here, and if there's a mod of /r/scrolls can you please post these links on the side bar for other new players to see in the future. If you like the post upvote it (I could care less for Karma :P) or just leave a comment. Good luck to everyone, and have fun :D.

since everyone says Energy is underpowered or weak I decided to make a small Energy guide with some handy advices.

http://www.scrollsguide.com/deckbuilder/#4903
This is a ranged Energy deck im running at the moment at ~1700 rating.

The main strategy behind energy is to use your spellcards such as Spark, Burn, Violent Dispersal, Thunder Surge or Blind Rage (sometimes also Iron Whip) to constantly clear your opponents board.

Use your structures to protect your creatures. Put important structures in the edges of your board, so their effect comes into play or the enemy is forced to react to prevent the effects of those structures - these are Ether Pump or Automata Forge. Always use Hellspitter Mortar in a protective way in the middle of your board.

Your creatures are very strong, especially your Gravelock Elder combo, so protect them with structures and beefy units like Gravelock Outcast (with combo). Surprise your enemy with cooldownreduction spells like Fury, Bombard or Iron Whip to clear his board (&lt;- clearing enemies board is very important, so you can control the game) and eventually kill his idols. Bombard + Concentrate Fire is a nice combo to surprisingly kill an idol with a Cannon Automaton. Iron Whip or Fury is a nice combo with Copper Automaton, since it attacks in the same turn you summon it.

Stall the game in the early phases with structures and cheap units like Gun Automaton and Scattergunner. Sacrifice Cooldownreduction spells or Concentrate Fire in the early stages of the game, since they're useless without your strong creatures. In the early phases you can also sacrifice Cannon Automatons. Don't sacrifice Violent Dispersal or Burn unless either one of those are the only card in your hand and you don't have enough board control -&gt; sacrifice for 2 cards or you need another Energypoint to do a killercombo. They're very efficient cards, especially Burn; you don't even lose a card after destroying a unit. Try to clear your opponents board with your spells/creatures and try to do that as efficient as possible - for example dont use 3 cards to kill 1 unit; 2 for 1 is sometimes ok, Copper + Ironwhip for example, but never do a 3 for 1. When you have enough Energy you can eventually make plays with your strong units and Bombard/Fury/Concentrate fire.
Also watch high rating Energy players like Sysp (http://www.scrollsguide.com/replays) and practice this strategy alot and you will have more and more fun with your Energy deck. :)",,False,self,t5_2scq0,1373249015.0,,,True,t3_1hsr7l,http://www.reddit.com/r/Scrolls/comments/1hsr7l/energy_some_advices_for_new_player/,

1.) These structures cannot have their damage buffed the same way creatures can via things like crimson bull, champions ring etc. so there damage will always be 1.

2.) The cannot move like creatures which further limits them currently, but it is understandable as they are both structures.

These are both understandable hindrances to the scrolls being structures, however I pose to you this problem.  They currently deal 0 damage to things like cannon automatons, and creatures with the order buff plate armor.  This armor in my mind should only reduce creature damage, and not structure damage, taking into consideration my previous points 1 and 2.  Things like thunder surge, and spark deal the correct amount of damage to these targets, it would only make sense that these 2 structures do the same.

TL;DR These 2 structures should have their damage changed from attack damage to spell damage, or allow their damage to be buffable.",,False,self,t5_2scq0,False,,,True,t3_1h7uz9,http://www.reddit.com/r/Scrolls/comments/1h7uz9/ether_pump_charge_coil_damage_thought/,

1371905335.0,12,self.Scrolls,1guqbq,"[Discussion] To Surrender or not to Surrender, that is the question.",12,0,47,http://www.reddit.com/r/Scrolls/comments/1guqbq/discussion_to_surrender_or_not_to_surrender_that/,"I'm curious what everybody thinks about Surrendering. Having played both MTG and games like DotA previously, to me it's natural to surrender once I feel the board state has run away - I know there may be a tiny chance of survival and a comeback, but unlike the previously mentioned games such a comeback would never be swift - on the contrary, it would most likely drag on for another 20-25 minutes if it would happen.

So there's the first example where I feel surrendering is the proper option - why not just gg go next and try to get in a game where you start off equal? An example is a recent game where my opponent had 3 Ether Pumps ticking, stopping me from ever getting a board going, and meanwhile slowly dealing damage with his gravelocks. I knew it would take a while for him to kill me, and that I could wipe his Ether Pumps with a lucky draw of Incendiaries+Inferno Blast, and maybe come back. On the other hand, since I know he's gonna be killing me very slowly, and the chance of me coming back is very slim, why not surrender?

The second example where I always surrender is when i *know* I've lost. And this is what it seems most people are annoyed about - I don't see why. When the opponents gets his 10 damage haste creature on the lane with my undefended last Idol, there's no reason for me to stay in the game, I just call gg and surrender to save some time. I also believe this gives the opponent some extra gold.

So, /r/scrolls, do you think Surrender should be used like I describe it, or do you find it more honourable to ""stay and fight"" till the death?",,False,self,t5_2scq0,False,,flair-order,True,t3_1guqbq,http://www.reddit.com/r/Scrolls/comments/1guqbq/discussion_to_surrender_or_not_to_surrender_that/,

So I am not an expert and I do not know all the ins and outs. However, tonight while streaming and challenging a few friends to games to try out new decks we discovered a quite glaring issue with card draws.

We know you can have only 3 of a card in deck. Assuming discard pile might work in a chronological order you shouldn't see the first card you discarded in your deck until after the whole deck has been drawn.

However tonight, I'm going to focus on a card that won me a game in a huge way. The card was Focus a +3 attack until end of turn order card. The first time I drew and played the card was on turn 14 and played and drew the 2nd and 3rd of focus on round 20.

Assuming 5 cards at the start and say maybe 10 sac card draws by round 20 I may have gone through the whole deck potentially. However,  I didn't count during the replay, I only watched when I drew and played the focus card. (Round 14 and 20).

On round 23 I drew my 4th focus and on round 26 I drew my 5th focus and won the game.

This is where the issue currently lies. The discard/draw system seems way too random and I will certainly link the game video for you all to see soon so you can see what I am talking about. I haven't heard much on this specific scenario so far and would love to hear thoughts on it if someone knows more.


Edit #2: http://www.twitch.tv/amputec/c/2417815 Video from before match start. I'm fairly close to counting at round 21 I am near 43 cards through my deck. Assuming I may have been off on a few cards not paying attention, I should be near 48 cards or so in a 50 card deck. Even still I am not at the end of my deck and my discard pile has already shuffled back into my deck.

But if Random is Random, and in the next 5 turns I got lucky then whatever. Just seems crazy that I dropped 5 focus in 26 turns",,False,self,t5_2scq0,1371106827.0,,,True,t3_1g933e,http://www.reddit.com/r/Scrolls/comments/1g933e/glaring_draw_issue_with_scrolls/,

1370801269.0,12,self.Scrolls,1fzq3t,New player impressions of the big 3 TCG/CCG games... or why Scrolls is the only one still installed.,22,10,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/Scrolls/comments/1fzq3t/new_player_impressions_of_the_big_3_tcgccg_games/,"So I have never played a TCG/CCG game in my life before last week and decided to see what the hubbub was about. After some research it seemed to me that MtG:Duels of the Planeswalkers, MM: Duel of Champions, and Scrolls are the big 3 out there right now. If I am wrong or missing another major title, forgive me, I didn't even know what the hell TCG or CCG meant a week ago. I'll give my impressions of the three in ascending order.

MtG: Duels of the Planeswalkers. I hated this game. I know MtG is the big daddy that started it all, but compared to the other two, I found the game mechanics to be a total bore. I imagine this style works quite well for an actual sit down card game, but on the computer it was a total snooze fest and I couldn't stand all the timer countdowns and interruptions and having to constantly hit ""continue"". After watching some Hearthstone videos and seeing that it will follow the same structure as this game, I've lost interest in that one as well.

MM: Duel of Champions. Thought this was the most aesthetically pleasing game visually and aurally with the exception of having cards instead of pieces. The dark motif and art style was very pleasing on the eyes. But I just could not get into it. I know these are card games, but the cool thing about being on the PC is those cards can actually be brought to life. As beautiful as those cards were, I just was not excited watching lifeless cards smash into each other. I also hated the feeling that they were using cheap tactics to try and get me to log in each day with the ""gold stashing"". Loved the rows and columns and having an actual hero to defend. If the cards turned into animated pieces as soon as you played them and if their economic model was done better, this might have actually been my favorite. As it stands, I was only entertained for a few days and found it tough to follow all the different cards being played, and mainly because they are all flat and lifeless.

Scrolls. The Burger King-esque color scheme is a bit of a turn off. I think I get the reasoning for it... coloring everything in the same fashion of weathered scrolls, but in my opinion that should have been left for the scrolls themselves and the board and pieces should have been more vibrant. I really like the weathered scrolls themselves and find it to be a nice representation of the ""cards"". The animations and gameplay really set this one apart from the others. I can't count how many times I came back from certain defeat and gradually built a deck that got me over a 1500 elo. Couldn't quite place my finger on it, but this was the only title of the three that ""hooked"" me. Found myself playing for 6 hours yesterday. Just... one.. more... game. The animations are well done and even though I am not a big fan of the artstyle of the pieces, having those scrolls come to life really makes such a difference to me in following the action and making the game exciting. The game may still need some balancing but for the most part my matches have been very competitive. Oh and finding matches... so painless. Love the simple interface and even though I wish there was a grid like placeholder system for the Deck Builder, I still found the Scrolls Deck builder the easiest to use, even if it can become a cluttered mess. I also feel a much better monetization system is in place with Scrolls than the MM game. Whatever pay to win aspect is in there, it is so minor that it is practically non-existent. I've acquired all the scrolls I wanted for my build without spending extra money or trading for scrolls.

In a way, I would love to combine the best aspects of MM:Duel of Champions and Scrolls. Where one shines, the other dulls. Overall though, Scrolls shines where it counts most and my thought when I woke up this morning was, I can't wait to play some Scrolls.

Today, Thursday 15th at 8:30pm BST, twitch.tv/scrollstream will be changing its format slightly. You can still challenge SeeMeScrollin, Rastien, and Grumpcat.. but now you'll win a random rare scroll if you beat your opponent. 

We are also going to play the present version of the Decay Precon on the test server, and we'd like you to tell us which (and how many of each) Decay Scrolls you feel are best suited for the Precon deck (more information on the normal precon requirements to come during the stream). 

Finally, we're lucky enough to have been given early access to a new decay scroll that hasn't hit the test server yet. It'll probably be added to the precon deck, but requires final tweaking, and we'd like your thoughts on what these tweaks should be.

I'm writing this so we can get as many people as possible to voice their thoughts on these areas of the game, your views are valuable.

So, I hope you get the chance to watch the stream but, if not, then watch it the following day at  http://www.youtube.com/user/seemescrollin, and comment on the vid then.

Check http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Scrollstream&amp;iso=20130808T2030&amp;p1=136&amp;ah=2&amp;am=30 for when it's starting in your region.

Why even allow mixing colors when only going 3 resources into a splash is nearly impossible to justify cost wise? Decay might imrpove the situation but why cant we splash more even now with the 3 existing colors?

Changing this should be number 1 priority even if it means completly reworking the current balancing.

He started putting down units every turn and I just kept holding him off with mortars, walls and other lowly units, saccing for cards each turn after getting my resource count to 6 or 7. I had an ether pump up and it went off once, then i got the thunder surge. Now he has order units flooded on the board. only the bottom row was empty, the second row had one or two units on it. After the ether pump only 2 of his guys had more than 2 health. and I had 2 units ready for that. So I thundersurged, moved my 2 units, and wiped his side of the board. He surrendered the next turn when i placed a cannon automaton.

For me it was a fenomenal win because had I not gotten the TS when i did i would probably have lost in about 2 or 3 turns. When going back to the lobby I was excited, and afraid that losing my next game would just make me angry. I felt like i couldnt play anymore because I was hotheaded and would probably make stupid moves the next game because of it. 

I see some guys streaming and just pull game after game and seemingly it does'nt matter to them if they win or lose, its just glhf, gg, on to the next game.

- [**Order vs Energy**](http://www.scrollsguide.com/replays/r/4161648) 

It seems like energy is specifically designed to counter order. They have infinite amounts of unit removal, but that's okay right because it costs them a lot of resources? Well no, because of burn they trade efficiently and not only kill the majority of your creatures with it, but gain a further advantage by drawing a card.

 For every card you summon, they remove it, gaining an advantage until it's hopeless. They have incredibly cheap and cost efficient cards that are also incredibly powerful. I don't know how people can think energy is underpowered; I can never win against them. The standard advice against energy is 'don't group up your units' but that seems impossible to me - order is designed around grouping up in order to buff creatures etc. Splitting up can only be done to a very limited extent.

Ok, this spell, ""potion of resistance"", i have seen it alot lately and i can understand why. It cost 1 energy, and makes your unit for 3 turns a walking waking stone that can potentially have more hp, and deals damage. Compared to waking stone itself, that cost 3order, can not move and can not attack so is its only benefit that the effect is permanent. And yes you can purify and stuff the potion of resistance guy but you can pothery on waking stone, there is always a answear.


So my question is if you feel ""potion of resistance"" is balanced, or if its cost should perhaps be increased or similer. I also believe that same thing can be asked regarding focus, i am a Order player but i do feel that Focus should perhaps be increased to 2 order cost. 


I do like how these low cost effective spells open up some mix faction deck stategy which i want to see, diversity is good. So i dont mind it to much, i just question how balanced it is.


Edit:I am very well aware of the answers you can do, and i know how to play against it, however i wish to note that like no one plays with ""purify"" in their deck and pushback is not always worth it. But it is still not a big issue, i often eather ignore the unit, poke it down or do pushback when it is worth.

When a match starts to really get going and the board starts to fill up, the more clicking the player has to do just to get the information they need to make a strategy decision, the more frustrating and confusing things get.

**Where is a Lobber unit's target area?**

A creature's attack range is easy to see since it's always in a straight line horizontally and--with the exception of Relentless--hits the first target along that line. Lobbers aren't as intuitive. If a player wants to find out what a lobber will hit, they either have to do a little mental math or click the unit to find out.

**What modifications have been made to a creature and how have they been made?**

Enchantments have a huge variety of effects on units and all the shimmer effect communicates is that the unit is under at least one of those effects. Have the unit's stats been attack/health been buffed? Does the unit have any triggers (e.g. ""when this dies..."", ""when this attacks..."", ""when you play a spell..."", etc)? Has the unit's movement been restricted/amplified? Is the unit under the effect of more than one of these things? Clicking on the unit is the only way to find out. 

[As a side note, Royal Vanguard's attack buff gives the exact same shimmer despite not being an enchantment and only lasting until the end of the turn. That also adds to the confusion.]

**What's a unit's maximum health? What's their maximum countdown?**

Players can tell that a unit is going to attack next turn by looking at it on the field. They can tell how much health is left to kill that unit by looking at it on the field. But if they want to know how long it will be until the next attack after this one, or what that creature is going to be healed up to if they don't kill that Machine Priest, clicking on the unit is the only way to find out.",,False,self,t5_2scq0,False,,,True,t3_1jf8qw,http://www.reddit.com/r/Scrolls/comments/1jf8qw/stop_making_me_click_on_stuff_to_get_information/,

I'd like some feedback/advice on this deck because I have only played Order before this, and I have no experience making decks for either Growth or Energy.

This deck is built around the DC Berserk/Iron Ogre combo, with the idea that I don't wan't to rely on that one combo to win me the game.  The gravelock outcasts can also be berserked, thanks to their regeneration ability.

Some concerns I had when testing;

* I'm not a fan of the vitality wells, but I don't know of a better way to keep my creatures healthy for longer.  They stag hearts can be helpful sometimes. **EDIT:**I have vitality wells in my current version because I don't have all the cards I need yet. Sorry!

* This deck feels weak against quake.

* There's a lack of card draw, a common problem with E, but I'm not sure I want to run Fertile soil.

* I feel like the deck has trouble keeping the board clear.

Do they:

A) If there is no valid scroll left in the deck it will find the topmost valid scroll in the discard pile (most recently put there).

B) If there is no valid scroll left in the deck it will find the bottommost valid scroll in the discard pile (least recently put there).

C) Causes your deck to be shuffled and the topmost valid scroll is selected.

Sorry if this has already been covered but I couldn't find any information on it.

EDIT:

So I did some testing because I don't know if anyone actually knows the answer to this. I made a 50 card deck with all unique cards including 4 structures, 4 creatures and 1 copy of each fetch scroll. 
On the first test I discarded all my structures and used summons which brought back the most recently discarded structure and did not shuffle my deck which seemed to indicate A) is how fetches work. 
However when I tested this again it brought back a structure that was the second most recently discarded so this leads to:

D) If there is no valid scroll left in the deck it will find a random valid scroll in the discard pile (most recently put there).

**Imperial Resources**. The card draw is good, the order increase is okay, and the other effects are negligible. All for 7 resources? Basically giving up a turn? And several places in your deck that would've allowed you to draw a useful card? Really? In my opinion, it needs to be either buffed to either 1. Keep it as it is, but allow it to 'overheal' units and idols, so idols would go to 11 health, units with a max of 3 HP would go to 4, etc. OR 2. Increase all its effects to two (2 card draw, 2 idol heal, 2 unit heal, 2 order gain) OR 3. At the very least, reduce the resources cost to what it was before, 6.

But energy, I win maybe only 1 game out of 10 even when facing 15xx guys, and then its just because I got lucky with my draws and the other guy got unlucky. I just don't get it, nothing I try works.

I can do nothing to protect my creatures. I get stones up and they violent dispersal them, my spiky units do nothing since energy is mainly ranged. They kill a big percentage of my units using damage spells, and the rest they focus down with bombard using their high-attack creatures. I can't get enough units out to get board control, and even if I could I couldn't put them in the usual order unit formations since then they'd just get thundersurged into oblivion.

In the mean time they put up all kinds of high-hp walls to protect their creatures, and use pots of resistance on their important creatures. I use pother and pushback as much as I can to try to get attacks trough, but they just throw down more than I can get rid of, then kill off my units.

About the only way I can get an attack in is if I use speed on the same round as I put down the creature, but most of their units have high enough hp that they can just tank that, and then they kill my creature, and you can only do that so many times before you run out of speed cards.

About the only thing I have going over them is card advantage, but that doesn't seem to help.

Firstly, I'm not doing this for any malicious reasons, just for educational purposes.

(I have been using C# for testing all of this and have used NetMon to monitor the traffic between my PC and Scrolls Server)

Firstly the Scrolls game server is located at: **54.208.22.193** on port **8081**.
You can log into the game by sending the following JSON message:

**{ ""msg"":""SignIn"", ""email"":""RSA Encrypted Email Address"", ""password"":""RSA Encrypted Password"" }**


You need to encrypt your email and password using RSA and the public modulus and exponent from the game.
I was able to achieve this by using the following code:

http://pastebin.com/udf0cK53

Once sent, the server returns 3 lines of information (If successful);
[I've hidden all my personal account information]

http://pastebin.com/en2TjhZ5

Once logged in, you can get all the available cards in the game by sending:

**{ ""msg"" : ""CardTypes"" }**

This returns a very long list of every card in the game:

http://pastebin.com/ZXkD9Ts8

The connection automatically closes to the server if it doesn't receive a 'ping' message every 10 seconds:

**{ ""msg"" : ""Ping"" }**

I'm still looking through the packet sniffer, but other commands that can be sent include things such as getting all the avatars, getting other peoples profiles, sending and receiving chat messages (Third party chat clients are possible I presume) but this is a good start for now!

Trading is there via website but its connected with the game.
I mean you manage your runes""Scrolls"" on website and you can put there your ""auction"".
Lets say you putting up 2 x iron ogres on auction.
You can also write description of your auction to describe in which scrolls you are interested with.
Auction will last for like 3-4 days before it disappear.
in that time people can bid your auction and offer you their scrolls or gold for your 2 x iron ogres.
You can leave there also comment if you need more info from guy that putted up auction.

I think I've seen about 5 or 6 different lists floating around now, but here's another template for those who are still seeking a spreadsheet to keep track of your Scrolls, that you are free to make a copy of if you desire: http://goo.gl/osP75

I did link this in an old post a couple days ago, and I noticed a couple people in the Trading sub-forum were using it. There were still some incomplete descriptions and flavour text in that version of the spreadsheet, but thanks to the nice people in the Reddit channel in-game (Hiwashi, Sunoccard, others), the list is now done and completely hand-verified, so you may want to grab a new copy if you had it before. Or otherwise.

I made this for myself with the aim of being sort/filter friendly, so it has more columns than necessary because I wanted to make the list more easily extensible in the future, when there are thousands of cards and ability types are added and sorting options are actually needed for some of the keywords. Also with columns, you can go into List View (View menu -&gt; List) and be able to directly filter for only cards with that attribute if you don't want to actually sort and then have to resort the table again.

And because I'm very much a stats person, it comes with a basic pivot table on the 2nd tab (at the bottom), which auto-updates as you fill in new cards and shows you the breakdown of your cards between Energy/Growth/Order and Common/Uncommon/Rare.

I know we are all eagerly awaiting the new content which seems so close yet so far, but let's not get irrational.
 Mojang have done amazing things over the past four weeks. The [community demanded more](http://www.reddit.com/r/Scrolls/comments/1ifdaz/how_do_we_tell_mojang_that_we_need_more/) community features, content, and transparency, and Mojang have responded in delivering just that. 

The test server is a great tool for ironing out bugs and balance much more quickly and practically than in the main client. The key difference between it and the client, in terms of scroll balancing, is that you get every scroll on the test server. This allows people to mess around with decks this helps the devs quickly and accurately balance the game. 


I think people are so keen on all the new content that they forget about all the inevitable negatives that would come with the elimination of the test server:

* More Bugs.

* An increase in server down time.

* An imbalance of cards.

* It would take longer to balance since on the test server you get every scroll where as you would have to buy them on the main client (scroll rarity may come into factor).

* People would QQ if a card was removed or drastically changed.

* Summoner Mods may cease to work more frequently due to client changes.

* Modders may be discouraged to pursue work on a mod by the constant client changes.


Positives:

* Getting new content faster.

My opinion is that test servers are a privilege, not a right and a tried and proven way of good game development practice.

With a buttload of new content on the horizon let’s all just hold in our scrollual frustration for a bit longer or just go blow your load over another CCG while you wait.

TLDR: Elimination of the test server is a bad idea IMO, let’s all just be patient.

1375846427.0,8,self.Scrolls,1juz0r,Deck Idea : Necrovore (monoD),11,3,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/Scrolls/comments/1juz0r/deck_idea_necrovore_monod/,"Below is a copy of [the post I made over at Scrollsguide](http://www.scrollsguide.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=46&amp;t=2548&amp;p=24159#p24159). I'm hoping to get some more feedback from y'all Redditors.

This is a deck based on [the new Necrogeddon](http://www.scrollsguide.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=2537) and the announcement made by MansOlson that Animovore does/will work on structures and not just creatures (linked thread, page 2).

**Central combos**

*Scavenger Construct + Animovore + deaths (Necrogeddon)*

For each death next to the enchanted Construct, you draw 1 and it is buffed by one instead of damaged by one.
Place the Construct in the middle of your board with Animovore on it, group X expendable creatures around it, and play Necrogeddon : you get X Husks attacking and X instant card draw (as a bonus, Construct is buffed by X).

*Deaths (Necrogeddon) + Totem of Suffering* 

*Necrogeddon + bonus-on-death creatures*

*Poisons + Miasma Well*

**The decklist**

http://www.scrollsguide.com/deckbuilder/#6676

**Resource spread**

1D / 3 : Mangy Rat, Staggering Muckhead, Scavenger Construct

2D / 4 : Animovore, Miasma Well, Languid, Loyal Darkling

3D / 4 : Blightbearer, Soul Steal, Lumbering Muckhead, Brain Lice

4D / 4 : Totem of Suffering, Infectious Blight, Damning Curse, Ilmire Hunter

5D / 1 : Oblivion Seeker

6D / 1 : Necrogeddon

This is a mono resource deck with a lot of low cost scrolls, so it should have pretty decent early/mid game, especially if you can get some draw going with Languid and Construct+Animovore.

**Past and possible future changes**

Pretty much everything is susceptible to change when scrolls themselves are and the deck has not been tested. 

*Update 1* : Rot Eater is out as it works poorly with the deck (what's the point of boosting it if it's going to die 3 turns later). Replaced with Ilmire Hunter, which is not particularly synergistic either but is a strong scroll by itself.

It's also 51 scrolls at the moment, the one to go will be picked upon testing.

**Strategy**

This is based on zero play test so it's very possible that this does not work well at all. 

*Early game* 

Get some cheap creatures out. You can put out a Construct and Animovore early on the second line with some disposable creatures in front. You can start to get a poison engine going with some Wells. Soul Steal and Languid will get rid of some early threats like Brave with a net scroll cost of 0. 
Get a Lumbering Muckhead (or 2 !) out as soon as you can. 
I guess you can get Totems out at this point but I imagine it's a better idea to hold on to them or sac (they are likely to get quaked away mid game). 

*Mid game*

Time to get those Muckheads to go to town. Do not hesitate to Damning Curse big threats (Great Wolves, etc) killing some of your own weak creatures, that will wind the Muckheads and Animovore. Blightbearers and Oblivion Seekers are here to die, use them liberally. 

*Late game*

Hopefully you have build a decent board presence with a Construct + Animovore in the center. If you run low on creatures, some draw should help getting some new ones out fast. Once you do have 4+ creatures around the Construct, it's combo time. Necrogeddon for a strong attack wave and 4+ draw (6+ if one of the creatures was an Oblivion Seeker !). With some luck you'll draw another Necrogeddon to rinse and repeat next turn, ad nauseam !
Try to get one or more Totems of Suffering out just before 'Geddon, as those are quite fragile.

**Matchups**

Again, this is based on 0 testing so I could be way off.

*Growth*

You can compete on early game with some cheap creatures of your own. Languid can neuter an early Brave. You creatures are weaker but you should be able to hold your ground, especially since you have the advantage of removal for early/mid game. Soul Steal will be great against Brave and Vaettrs and maimed creatures ; Damning and poison + Miasma should take care of the bigger threats effectively. If you can get a Construct + Animovore at 4+ health in range of multiple creatures, your opponent is never going to want to Quake you as it would give you loads of draw. That should help keep the Wells and Totems on the board ! 

*Order*

I'm really not sure how that match up would go, I can't wait to test it.
Spiky is going to kill a lot of your stuff, but it's not really a problem since you can profit from it. Damning Curse and boosted poison will come in very handy against the beefy creatures (also, Ilmire Hunter). Pushback and Purification will be a problem for your central Contruct (also, Pushback on a Lumbering about to attack = sadface). Good news is, an Order opponent has no ways to deal with your nasty structures outside of direct creature damage... and Speed Mangonel, which will probably hurt just as much as it does other decks. There's a reasonable chance you can get enough draw going to keep up with Imperial Ressources late game. 

*Energy*

Structure removal is going to hurt a lot. Fortunately nobody runs Incendiaries, let's hope it stays that way. VDs on Lumbering Muckheads will be annoying (but then gain he trades a 6 cost for a 3 cost). It might be challenging to get through Energy's beefy structures as you have no structure removal whatsoever. Poison is a good counter to the omnipresent Potion (but again, not on structures). On the bright side, they'll never be able to keep up with your draw. It might still be a tough matchup.

Some of my opinions are below.

Soul Steal: I love this card. It's a Spark that only affects units it can kill, and it gets you a Staggering Muckhead. That's removal and board presence all in one card, so in terms of card advantage it's a +1. It may only work when a kill is available, but it is not out of the question to sacrifice your own units in decay.

Blightbearer: At first, I was questioning if this card was worth it. Then, I saw it used in real matches and changed my mind. 3 attack is powerful for a 3 drop, but the best part is the effect it has. It can wipe an entire row of units with poison. Good positioning is essential, but this thing can set up some insane combos. I thought the drawback is it can kill your own units, but decay has many moments where that is actually a good thing. I will definitely be having a lot of fun with this one.

Despite that, I really feel that growth &amp; energy have huge advantages in a couple areas.

* Countdown in low levels / Haste
* Board Clearing ability
* Ability to draw cards

----------------------------------------------------------

**[Concept Deck: http://www.scrollsguide.com/deckbuilder/#5246](http://www.scrollsguide.com/deckbuilder/#5246)** 

This is the *concept* deck, I've been trying to use with substitutions because I don't have 3 heritage. 

The concept was to: 

* Increase squishy units to easily be able to regain control of board
* Increase Ability to Draw to prevent diminishing returns due to use of low cost cards
* Add enchantments to ensure that despite the units being squishy they have defensive properties

Cards I don't have 3 of: Magonels, Pother, Heritage

--------------------------------------------------------

**What I need?**

Help. I'm really struggling here. I think I may have strayed too far from Order's strong suit. Patience and waiting for units to stack. However, I hate when my first three turns result in no units and/or when I run out of cards. Any advice/criticism would be appreciated. 

--------------------------------------------------------
**EDIT**

Thanks everyone for the advice!

* Focus on High Health Units
* Suffer the first turns, to get board presence
* Remove enchantments involving units dying (as units should not be)

The decks were pretty consistent. 

* Any Order Unit with more than 3 or more health
* Mangonel for possible board clearing ability
* Flip, Pother, or Tranposition for organizing units
* Blessing of Haste and Speed for turn speed
* Focus for attack strength
* Kabonk for the early game
* Imperial Resources for the late game

Would love any feedback / discussion / thoughts! :)*

* [Gravelock Mercenary](http://i.imgur.com/4gasklx)

I feel pretty good overall about the balance of this card as a respectable mid to late game force.  It might seem OP initially but that 4 countdown can make it utterly useless if you don't protect your other gravelocks adequately.

* [Polymorphal Memorium](http://i.imgur.com/7Duz9rA)

**With the announcement that there will be no memorial cards we are used to, to gain resources in multi-resource decks either for or from decay, I felt this would be a creative way to gain resources, that fit with the decay theme. (I also really liked the card art for this haha)**

* [Putrid Embrace](http://i.imgur.com/YKWqWHn)

**While it might seem counter-intuitive upon reading initially - I really like the thought of having another card other than the paw that gave health.  I understand why they are so valuable - and I felt this was a really cool mechanic for decay to counter growth (as one would think it naturally would)  Ultimately this card would nullify the poison damage on the card, and if you had a means to heal the unit (leeching ring etc.)  The poison damage turns into permanent health creating more unique multi deck options.**

* [Rotten Tendrils](http://i.imgur.com/EyIyxnj)

**Nothing complicated here, just a direct counter, or the yin to Ancestral Totem's yang if you will.**

* [Shadow Rider](http://i.imgur.com/DON0XNr)

**So this guy I debated so many times how to balance him, and I am not quite sure what tweak he needs.  Remove Haste?  Decrease his hp to 1?  Increase his resource cost?  I am not quite sure need help on this one, but I like the mechanic of something reducing a targets damage.  Could provide for creative ways to clog enemy lanes.**

* [Swarm of Souls](http://i.imgur.com/NlIw2Fr)

**This is another card that I really like the concept up, but might still need a tad bit of balancing on it's health and casting cost values, but ultimately I think this is pretty good as it is.**

* [Toxic Spores](http://i.imgur.com/NASjK6q)

**Nothing too unique about this one, it's almost identical to the energy card dealing direct damage, but instead it's higher cost and damage over time, opposed to direct damage.**

* [Unrelenting Strenghth](http://i.imgur.com/rt1Fbkv)

**While it might seem like a wall of text, and verbiage might be a mouthfull, I really like the idea of this spell.  It fits well with the sacrificial theme in decay.  You gain more benefit destroying your own units to help clear a troublesome lane, once.**

*Thanks for taking the time and please feel free to critique the concept cards, I have tons of other ideas, but felt like this was a good sample size based on theory-crafting / anticipation of what decay will hold for us!*

If you sac every turn and get 8 E/G/O, then you've drawn 50 cards by turn 22 (22 auto-draws, 14*2 draws from sac), without even considering any card draw in your deck. This means having 1 or 2 of a scroll can be a much better decision in this game than some other TCGs. Having 1 scroll means that you probably won't have it early game, but definitely will have it late game which can be a very good thing. 2 scrolls is probably good for some situational or expensive scrolls.

Conventional wisdom says that if a card is worth having, it's worth having 3 of, but I want to know **what scrolls do you intentionally only put 1 or 2 of in your deck?** For now, I'm using 1 [Magma Pack](http://www.reddit.com/r/Scrolls/comments/1gzq9b/magma_pack_viable/) since it's useful pretty much only good in the late game, but can very powerful when it's needed.

I just bought into the Scrolls beta last week, and the game just blew away the free time of my last couple of days. I have played mostly against the AI and have beaten all easy and medium trials and three hard ones. 

As a MTG veteran I appreciate the streamlined resource management. No more ways to get mana screwed :) also the hex battle field offers another layer of strategic depth that is very different from most classical TCGs. Playing seems to reward the better player more than the better cards (to a limit), which makes beating some of the harder trials possible. 

That having been said, my main reason for writing this post is that a couple of things seem to be missing for scrolls to be truly great. 

No1 (by a huge margin): more content!!! There are only three factions at the moment and each of these factions has only about 40 cards. There seem to be very few variances in the top decks of each color and a lot of cards are absolute must haves for their faction (Kinfolk Brave e.g). Other cards are absolutely unplayable (Junkyard anyone), and with so few cards to chose from makes the choices even more predetermined.  
In each color there seems to be a deck that wants to be built regardless of your preferences of strategy. Consider just one color in one block of magic. There are dozens of possibilitys for building a deck, which is of course a result of the number of cards. In scrolls there seems to be only one possibility. 

No2: more game modes. As it is now there are only a couple of easy to use battle modes for some quick matches. In itself this is fine, and they should definitely remain. However, having a bigger incentive to play would give the game some more replayability besides boosting your rating. My suggestion would be implementing a booster draft like mode (again copied from MTG) where everybody opens a pack of cards, picks their favorite and gives the rest to the next player. Something similar is planned for Hearthstone afaik. Sealed deck modes would also offer variety, once the card pool has been increased.

Hello everyone, me and my friends started playing scrolls a few weeks ago. I loved it every much, but after a while we started trading and noticed that it was pretty spammy. I offered to build a little tool to make trading between us easier.

Features:

- No registration required.

- Create, edit, delete your posts.

- Search

- Database with prices of scrolls. After creating your posts it calculates if its below or above the average card prices.

(match vs Xardok),8,1,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/Scrolls/comments/1gnhv9/one_of_the_most_rewarding_feelings_ever_match_vs/,"So i was playing someone called Xardok, who i will refer to as he because im not sure of gender but im assuming. He was an amazing player and it was the best match i've ever played. 

The match lasted well over an hour, about 20 minutes to a half hour in I was down to 3 idols with 1 at 1 health and he gets a good turn and we both think he has me beat. he says gg i say gg and then he attacks. Turns out neither of us can count because im left with 1 health. so i have 2 idols on 1 hit and i manage to get a good turn to secure them.

I hold him off from getting a single hit for over half an hour, there were times where if i didnt get an exact card i would have lost or if he had a certain card he would have won, we had gone over 50 rounds when i end up eventually winning the match. by getting everything aligning right and a lucky hit from a hellspitter. Also the match ended less than 5 minutes before a server reset. 

Anyway Xardok if you are reading this that was an amazing match and im sure i wont play one like that again for a long time. hope to play you again someday!

I didn't do a whole lot of research but ended up picking Energy. Now after playing for awhile, from my perspective it seems like the different resources might be a bit unbalanced and a lot of players have picked up on it. 

I feel like Growth is the strongest deck because most of the players I go up against seem to play Growth and 9 times out of 10 I lose to Growth players. Keep in mind I got the game close to it's release in open beta and have a near full Energy deck. I feel like Growth's advantage lies in its mass of character cards with the 'Haste' ability and its crippling enchantments and spells such as Bear Paw, God Hand, Crimson Bull, and Rallying.

I know ultimately it's suggested to eventually form a mixed deck but I feel like they should start off somewhat balanced.

**Galvanic Cascade**

3E

Spell

-Deal 2 damage for each energy spell played this turn, including this spell.

Flavor Txt - *""First there's a tingle, then a bite. Next thing you know...Kaboom!""*

First one is a personal dear wish for energy: a 3 cost kill spell. By it self it is an expensive spark. But you can combine it spark for 6 damage, essentially 2 for 1 most cards, which is a fair trade. I limited it's synergy to energy spell, so you cant abuse low cost cantrips from other factions, and as energy has no low cost cantrips it seems to come out to be fairly useless on its own until you need to specifically kill a big creature and don't have VD in hand. 


**Discharge**

1E

Spell

- Deal a random opponent Unit is 1 damage. If that Unit is destroyed, draw 1 scroll.

Flavor Txt - *""Watch you head boyos, not sure where this is headed!""*

I won't deny it, I was somewhat offended that kabonk was an order card and we didn't have a low cost poke of our own. Though as you can see, even though its cheaper it is far worse than kabonk. Before you write it off though, it is a god send early vaetters and other 1 health annoyances, though probably not worth the card slot on its own it synergizes pretty well with Galvanic Cascade. 


**Arc Technician**

4E

Creature - Human

1 Attack , 2 Cooldown, 2 Health

Ranged*

When Arc Technician comes into play, draw one Spell from your Library.

When Arc Technician is destroyed, draw one Spell from your Library.

Flavor Txt - *~Bzzrt~*

This is my favorite of the bunch, on the face it seems kind of much, but it solve two of energy's biggest problem without being overly heavy handed. Problem one, early to mid game consistency. It's spell summon ability helps insure you have the kill spells to maintain board advantage. When it leaves play, it grants a second spell, but you have less control of when you get that effect, unless you are running Nutrition or other less than common cards. The second issue it resolves is maintaining lategame card advantage. The card is an unwieldy 4E cost, so its not easily abusable and the creature drop is pretty weak. In addition, the card is a soft counter to quake, when it dies it brings to you possible responses to even the playing field.

* Redone replay controls, with Slower/Normal/Faster rather than confusing percentages

To make sure you guys get the fastest updates and fixes possible, I decided to create a new Summoner repo for ScrollsPost (and only ScrollsPost).

Nobody is required to migrate to it. I will continue to update the version on the ScrollsGuide's repo, but I would highly suggest it as you get updates and bug fixes instantly rather than having to wait 1 - 7 days for the version to be approved.

The version on ScrollsPost is already v1.0.7 which fixes a bug in the replay list as well as a bug that caused chat to break if you typed /pcQuake instead of /pc Quake, this has been submitted to ScrollsGuide as well.

I'm curious what scrolls people consider to be underrated. Here's a few of my choices:

**Flip**. When I first started with my Mono Order deck, Flip was one of my favorite cards. Having that much control over my opponent's board felt really powerful, but as I did more research into decks, I noticed no one really played it. I read posts that said that you usually choose between Flip or Pushback, and Pushback is a better card. So I got rid of Flip until recently I noticed thinking to myself ""if only I had a Flip right now..."" So now I have Flip, Pushback, and Pother in my deck, and I don't regret it one bit. Flip wins matches.

**Charge Coil**. I recently played a match with a friend where he got out 3 charge coils quickly along the bottom lane, while his creatures were played in the upper middle lanes. I couldn't do much about the Charge Coils, but they slowly whittled away at my army. I found it nearly impossible to build up my Order units with all the residual damage. I ended up losing that match for a few reasons, and I jokingly said, ""Wow Charge Coils op, huh?"" He told me that he was dropping the Charge Coils because high ranked Energy players don't use them. I understand it's a bit of a gamble; they don't really do much late game when/if your opponent has a lot of units, but in the early game those things will definitely slow you down.

**Catapult of Goo**. The brunt of many jokes, and secretly one of my biggest fears. These are just amazing control lobbers. It's difficult to position to take them out considering anything they hit gets their countdown increased, and with 4 HP they enter the realm of ""probably going to take two attacks to take down."" Put down 2 or 3 of these behind some walls and maybe you can get your opponent to surrender out of sheer frustration.

1372271461.0,9,self.Scrolls,1h4hej,What mechanics would you like to see?,13,4,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/Scrolls/comments/1h4hej/what_mechanics_would_you_like_to_see/,"Here's my thoughts, listed as a mechanic, an example of that mechanic, and then an explanation of that mechanic.

**Mechanic #1:** Cannot Be Sacrificed

* *Sovereign of the Night*
* 6/2/4
* Cost 5
* Creature - Assassin
* Cannot be Sacrificed

This is about as simple as it comes. Cannot be sacrificed means that the card may not be used to generate mana, or to draw two cards. (Maybe it can't even be sacrificed for things like Fertile Soil). The play pattern of the card is interesting. Since you can't actually sacrifice it for cards, if you draw this as your only card, and can't play it, you are stuck for the turn. Or early on you can't sacrifice it for mana to play other cards. It's a very strong negative effect. So why is a strong NEGATIVE effect an interesting mechanic?  Because it allows you to pair it with strong effects to create an interesting bit of tension on the player during deck design. The same way the 4/1/2 automaton that dies after it attacks is empowered by its sacrifice effect, so too can things with 'cannot be sacrificed'.



**Mechanic #2:** Invisibility


* *Nightmine*
* Structure
* -/-/1
* Cost 2
* Invisible (Does not show on the map, cannot be blocked)
* When Nightmine is killed by an attack, it deals 2 damage to the attacker, and you draw 1 scroll

or

* *Thoughtful Assassin*
* Creature - Assassin
* 4/2/1
* Cost 3
* Invisible (Does not show on the map, cannot be blocked)
* Whenever you sacrifice, Assassin loses Invisible until start of your next turn.

The invisible mechanic is somewhat positive, somewhat negative. The idea is that when the invisible creature attacks, it goes straight for the idol. This prevents it from attacking enemy creatures, which is bad, but allows it to progress towards its victory condition, which is good. The two example cards I have here are two styles of this mechanic. The first is the 'nightmine' that is a defensive structure rigged to explode. The enemy doesn't see it, but will destroy it if they attack it. (Unless they deal zero damage I guess). This lets you use it as a hidden defense and play mind games. The game handles invisible creatures by showing that the opponent is casting them, but not showing where they are summoned to. This means that the non owner has to 'figure out' where the unit is if they want to attack it. Obviously some structures/creatures will be able to defend against invisible or reveal it.

The Assassin creature is a different take on Invisibility. It gives you the option of using it as an attacked (But then it will be vulnerable to counter attack and spells), but only if you do not sacrifice on that turn. (In case you were wondering, all these cards were from the same 'set' which is part of why they have the sacrifice theme) We create some tension about whether you want to use the Assassin to develop board position, but be vulnerable, or slowly chip away at enemy idols.



**Mechanic #3:** Punishers


* *Desolate Punisher*
* Creature - Nomad
* Cost 1
* 1/2/1
* Desolate Punisher gains +3 Attack for each destroyed enemy Idol.

The punisher mechanic, as I call it, is for units to become stronger after you have managed to take down some of the enemy's Idols. The play pattern is hopefully to get you to sacrifice more work in taking down that first idol just so your punisher units, or their analogs, can power up.  This Desolate Punisher unit is a pretty terrible 1 cost creature.. unless you have an enemy idol down. Then it's a cheap powerhouse that could let you push through to victory that much faster.  By creating cards that want you to skip the normal 'kill all their guys before they kill your guys' mentality, we create different avenues to victory and more decisions on the part of the player. Sacrifice my powerful kinfolk brave so my first idol doesn't go down? Or let them start dropping 4/2/1 punishers for 1.



**Mechanic #4:** Rank/File


* *Mesmeric Tower*
* Structure
* Cost 4
* -/-/3
* Can only be placed in the front of a row.
* Enemies in the same row as Mesmeric Tower have -1 movement and -1 Attack.

There are two different but related mechanics here. The first is the idea that the position of a structure/creature could be limited or cause modifiers. In this case, the Mesmeric tower can ONLY be put in the front (closest to enemy) of a row. This is a limitation that makes the second effect on the card not completely broken: The structure has a negative effect to opponents in the same row. In this case, the Mesmeric tower will mostly root enemies in one spot, and weaken them. This is very strong of course, since you can lock down some enemies, and the only reason it isn't overpowered, is because of that first effect... You can't put the tower in the back where it could be defended (nor can you stack up multiples of the tower to make all enemies do no damage)

By caring about rank and file positioning in the game, we bank on the biggest feature of Scrolls: The interesting game board. Adjacency has been explored a bit, for synergy purposes. But realizing your units can have an effect on opposing units (or even idols) is pretty interesting. A version of the above tower that didn't have the -1 movement or the front rank clause, would also be an interesting defensive structure (though a much weaker one).",,False,self,t5_2scq0,1372271869.0,,,True,t3_1h4hej,http://www.reddit.com/r/Scrolls/comments/1h4hej/what_mechanics_would_you_like_to_see/,

I've have constructed an order deck - I do well vs other order and energy - but I lose to growth (who doesn't?)

If your idols are so low that they need a 1 HP heal its prob gg anyhow. It also uses 7 resources to cast, so late game I invariably need the resources to try and remove enemy units, Imperial resources doesn't do this.

Also, creatures that I know will die soon make good targets for the Magma Pack. For example, if I have a poisoned creature that can still get one last attack in, or I have an injured or low health creature lined up with a high health enemy that will kill my guy next turn. I've also ended a few games with a magma pack on a iron golem, cannon automaton, or scatter gunner on a 3rd totem.

Cards like New Orders, Horn of Ages, Transposition, and Roasted Bean Potion emphasize this.  

But there's a problem. Movement superiority isn't really important that often. I would guess that the devs imagined a game where players spread out their units, and players with movement superiority could jump in to take out weakly defended units, then jump out. That's not how the game has gone though. You need three idols to win, so it's perfectly viable to ignore half the board. What's more, players almost exclusively arrange their units in phalanxes with high hp units at the front and valuable units in the back. This means that even if you can move a long ways, it's not going to do anything because your opponent has no weak spots to move towards.

This emphasis on grouping units in the same row means that players instead focus on cards that let them overpower or dismantle their opponent's rows.  Hence we have Focus and Blessing of Haste as high-tier cards for overpowering opponents, while Pother, Pushback, and Flip allow you to dismantle your opponent's rows, negating walls and exposing valuable units.

So what do we do from here?  I really don't know. Short of penalizing players somehow for losing idols, I'm not sure what there is to do.

Firstly let me put a disclaimer that I do know that these are pretty much just complaints with no real solution offered, and I absolutely love the game and will continue to play the heck out of it. Also, the game is very new and these issues could quite possibly just be the metagame being too babby to adjust to the strengths of the opposing players faction. I know that moving forward these are the issues I will be trying to strategize to overcome. 

1. Order &gt; Growth. Order has many spells that seem to hard counter growth spells. Most growth strategies are centered around buffing a single unit to all hell, like a wildling, great wolf, kinfolk etc. However order can simply remove the enchants or flip it out of safety and 1 shot it with focus. Pushback also removes enchants. There are many spells that seem to simply hard counter any growth strategy centered on single units. I have lost countless games solely from Flip, and imho it is the only truly broken scroll in the game. It should at least have a resource cost of more than 2. The only way I have beaten order as growth is if I crush the early game which is completely dependent on the other guy not drawing ""spiky 2"" spearmen guys.

2. Growth &gt; Energy (sorta). This one is much less concrete. I have found that Energy has a tough time stopping growth from building to the point of no return unless they simply outplay them hard. Much of energy is based on large area of effect play, and growth can be at or near full strength with only a couple of creatures in play. (not to mention i love using bunnies to block copper automatons). Now this bullet is much less true than the first as Energy has plenty of ways to overcome Growth, especially with direct damage spells and simply better play.

3. Energy&gt;Order. Now, I don't main Energy or Order, but from the friends I have spoken to and by my understanding of the game, Order feels very weak against Energy. Much of Energy is focused on aoe play, while much of Order is focused on clumping up a bunch of creatures for the buffs. These two factors clearly give Energy the advantage. The single target spells of order and positional play mean less (or much, much more) when much of the board is covered in blast zones.

I like *Tick Bomb* because it instantly removes structures, regardless of health. In many cases those structures have greater than three health (like artillery), namely [](#hellspittermortar) and [](#druidburialground). It's also great for those pesky [](#wakingstones).

On the other hand, it can be frustrating to decide which structure to break. While there is an [](#ancestraltotem) or [](#shrine) about, there are other walls in the way of my attackers. There may even be multiples of those totems. In these cases *Incendiaries* comes out on top. It's also good for clearing up those slightly-damaged structures (like [](#uselesscontraption) or *Clock Library* with low health.

I've always been a fan of straight removal rather than board-wide damage, so I'm leaning to staying where I'm at. However, there are a few cases where I had several *Illthorns* in the way and just wanted to clear them out without wasting my ranged attackers.

What are your thoughts on the two? One or both (or neither)?

EDIT: Just had an interesting idea. Instead of either one of these, [](#overdrive) instead on their structures. Considering I'm using *Clock Library* myself, it would double as a speed up for card draw or damage over time on their structures. Think I'm going to go that round instead, especially since the 2 damage is enough to kill the totems on the first turn.",,False,self,t5_2scq0,1370932197.0,,,True,t3_1g3six,http://www.reddit.com/r/Scrolls/comments/1g3six/deck_building_tick_bomb_vs_incendiaries_one_both/,

I've seen a few posts talk about it on the official forums, but haven't seen anyone mention it here yet. I understand why they're not currently available, the game is young and there's more important things to worry about at the time, but in the future it'd be nice to see them implement foils.

I don't think it should work the way MTG does though, where you get a foil every pack. That would probably over saturate this market with foil cards. So, maybe a chance of a foil in 1 out of 5 packs? They'd also have to look a bit different. Besides the card having a shine to it, make the foiled unit glimmer a bit.

It's not really an important suggestion, it's just one of those extra things that card collectors tend to enjoy. Eventually you'll stock pile so many cards that the thrill of opening packs diminishes, but adding foils gives something for more people to go for, and helps increase the value of cards. It's not a gold sink, but it's a good way for someone with a large amount of gold to shift some of his gold to a more casual player who happened to get lucky and nab a rare foil card.

I'm talking about stuff like Quake, Violent dispersal, Burn, Spark, rangers bane(lesser extent), Necrogeddon(soon), Pushback, Blind Rage, Decimation, Divine Mark(Lesser extent), Flip, Frost cards and more. All these cards are somewhat fair(minus decimation), but there is no way to block like 80% of these and as time progresses and these cards ramp up in effects it would be nice to see some full spell protection methods and maybe even idol damage reduction methods.

A few idea's I had is say there is a creature that is played and it becomes essentially a martyr and all damage done to say a honorable general or removals would then transfer to say a Vanguard or scholar. Something like a spell redirection. If say a quake goes off it would hit the vanguard double, but not damage the general at all.

Another option is say a spell too that would do the same thing where damage is redirected. This could still be purified off or pushed back, but the enchanted unit would still be safe until the spell is off the field.

One that I think would be interesting too would be all damage from any spell would be ignored for 3 turns. 

As for idol protection it could be say I enchant a brave and now that brave would take all damage another rows idol would take until dead or would take up to 2 damage instead of the idol.",,False,self,t5_2scq0,False,,flair-multi,True,t3_1j45d3,http://www.reddit.com/r/Scrolls/comments/1j45d3/should_there_be_full_spell_protection_cards_or/,

I main growth, and the more I think about the mirror match-up btw growth players, the more I believe that many matches come down to 2 deciding factors in the early game. Please keep in mind that the following discussion revolves around growth vs growth.

1. Do you go first?
2. Do you have a Kinfolk Brave in your hand by turn 2 and can he survive a possible Ranger's Bane?

If you answer positive to both questions you will win most of the time in growth vs growth. 

The reason I think these 2 factors can determine the outcome of a game is because growth is a deck about board control. In a mirror match-up, the player that gains board control keeps it and wins. Kinfolk Brave is a unit that allows you to clear the board before 5-cost   Veteran comes in. Growth has notorious 3-cost creatures; the Noaidi nerf I think was a bit excessive as it makes him extremely underwhelming unless you splash order and get matched up against an order player (which is not seldom but irrelevant for G vs G). 4-cost Mangy or Brother will die before they get to attack unless dryadic powered. Every other early game creature gets chased down and one shotted. If the player can go first, play Brave, and have something to block/buff for it, he can snowball into a situation that Quake might not even salvage at that point. 

The things I can come up with to prevent getting swept by a single Brave are as followed:

1. If the other player doesn't have a buff in his hand, Ranger's Bane will kill it in 2 turns. 1 for 1 but you will lose at least 2 idol hp or a creature. 

2. Counter with your own Brave, but summon it at the same time with a tank in front of it i.e. Sister in front of Brave. Without buffs he will have to trade his Brave for your Sister, but if he does have something to survive one hit from your Brave then this doesn't work.

Other than those you could potentially root it in place, but that is a 2-cost creature that will still take down an idol, and that also loses board control. I think a lot of games are decided by simply who is going first, and who can have an early Brave that is protected in some way.

http://www.scrollsguide.com/deckbuilder/?d=1817

This deck centers around amassing a large amount of resource and cards and juggling the two haste creatures, especially vets.

Callback and Metempsychosis can be used to refresh the cooldown on a haste unit, get another scroll from a sister of the fox, or get more resources from a structure. They both also act as full heals.

Divine Mark helps keep your Vets in play if they're going to die, as well it can be used for the combo Heritage + Divine Mark + Fertile Soil for a serious amount of bonus scrolls.

Heritage, Imperial Resources, Fertile Soil, and the Memorials act to give you a giant scroll and resource advantage. With call back, metempsychosis and memorials I've been able to get a total of 6 resources by turn 3.

Quake, Frost Gale, Decimate, and Pushback all help to exacerbate your scroll advantage by clearing the board. They can also be used to trigger your Heritage if needed. Decimate is also very useful for weakening the idols enough for a Vet+Focus+Focus to take it out. And you will have that opportunity often seeing as once the deck gets going you'll be playing a good 6 cards per round.

Blessing of Haste will allow your haste units to attack every round you happen to have on in your hand.

Royal Infantrymen act to make your haste creatures beefier, so they're less likely to die in the one round their out and vulnerable. They also act as a good target for Heritage + Fertile Soil which is what most of the other not haste creatures are for.

I used to run Faith Chains in this deck since I tend to kill a lot of my own units, but I've found keeping board advantage and killing the idols with your units is much more effective.

Edit: I edited the deck a bit. I've been having difficulty with high HP units so I threw in a Unleash Inner Power so I can take them down to 2 hp instantly. I also added summons since it can be a problem if you don't get a lot of memorials at the start. I also modified the amount of scrolls per stack to reflect what cards I want to show up the most often.",,False,self,t5_2scq0,1371313391.0,,flair-order,True,t3_1gedpj,http://www.reddit.com/r/Scrolls/comments/1gedpj/craziest_deck_ideas/,

I've seen plenty of questions about which purchase is better for your gold between the Random Scrolls and the Scroll Pack.

Initially I was only purchasing the Scroll Pack for the obvious guaranteed Rare and 2 Uncommons, then I decided to try using only the Random Scrolls and chart my findings.

After buying 200 Random Scrolls I have found a total of 138 Commons, 31 Uncommons and 31 Rares.

Since I was buying the Random Scrolls in groups of 10 at a time, I have found on average 6 commons, 2 uncommons and 2 rare per 10 cards. 

These stats will obviously become more accurate over time and I plan on updating my chart everytime I purchase Random Scrolls. 

However please keep in mind that Random is Random, don't expect to get 5 rares in your first 10 buys.

Cards that use the energy dump mechanic but cost a different resources. An example I thought of would be like a half dead Frankenstein cyborg type creature. It would cost 3 decay have zero atk 1 cd and like 3 hp and then an effect were you can pay energy to increase its Atk for that turn. Or maybe a decay creature that took dmg at the end of every turn if you didn't put energy in to it. Cards like these would be great to splash because even if you were not drawing energy cards you could use your energy every turn. I'm not sure if those example cards would be balanced but I think the concept is great and should be used in the game.

So anyway, this post isn't going to be as lengthy darkblade's complete review, rather it's going to be about the few things I see needing a change. Please remember that my thoughts are subject to change, and that I will take any constructive feedback into consideration.

Puppet soilder plus nutrition - This card combo is insane, while it can be played around... It's the strongest ''comeback'' combo in the game, and should be at least slightly nerfed. Either completely by having nutrition not work on puppet soilder, or by changing puppet soilder's effect changed to deal an amount of damage. Again it can be played around, but it's simply not much fun to do so.

Restless Bones - I would like to see undead as a subtype for most/all of the human types in Decay, if for nothing else than to give Decay some sort of cooldown reduction as I feel that's it's primary weakness. This card might be OP in the future, but it's simply unplayable in this current state of the game.

Rat King - I would prefer this card be a three cost that gives two rats. Right now, I'm not sure if it's just really good, or if it's overpowered. At three it was the best card in the game for various reasons, primarily being that it gave growth a perfect curve. Also because it has amazing synergy with Fertile Soil, Crimson Bull, Ancestral Totem,  and Godhand. And while it's not as game breaking with soil anymore, it's still amazingly good for other synergy's I mentioned. Personally I would prefer it be a three drop that gives two rats since growth is severly lacking on it's three drops.

Illmire Hunter - I don't see why this card needs five health, as a four drop with an amazing effect, I'd like to see it's hp drop down to four.  

Wings Solder and Sister of the Bear - I love the concept of blank cards with great stats, Personally I'd like to see both these cards get a one hp boost. Wings solder is just a weaker crossbowman in it's current form, but given one more hp it would give Order another two cost playable. Sister of the Bear just feels slightly weaker than most other four drops, with one more hp she would be great. Some people might disagree with me, saying these stats are too strong, but considering they have no effect... I feel slightly stronger stats makes sense here.

Fleetness - I think some people see the one cooldown as a lot stronger than it is. The idea of this card is you can double the value of a card for a lower cost than the card you cast it on, but you are putting two cards into one, so if that one card dies two are dead. It seems like a fair risk  versus reward card to me. I would like to see this card changed back to a two cost. It's simply not playable at three. At two it's playable, but not amazing. 

Magnetizer - This card is one of the weakest three drop cards in it's current state, I'd like to see it given one hp and one attack, or have it's cost reduced to two. Again I think it's just so weak because of the one cooldow, which isn't gamebreakingly good as some people believe it to be, it's just good.

Necrogeddon - I haven't had a chance to test this card in it's newer state, I do like the concept a lot better than the old one. But I'd simply need to test it to have concrete thoughts on it.

So that does it for my ''what Yugi would like changed'',  but I don't have any feels of entitlement here, and if nothing is changed, then that's ok too. I just think these changes would be nice. At least on the test server where we can hammer out the cards that are too strong or too weak. I'd also like to see cards released at a faster pace, as this is beta, and even if something isn't perfect, I'd hope we could simply change it on the main servers.",,False,self,t5_2scq0,False,,,True,t3_1jw2f2,http://www.reddit.com/r/Scrolls/comments/1jw2f2/yugis_thougts_on_the_new_scrolls/,

Scrolls Power Tournament (or SPT for short) is a tournament that I have created. The ultimate goal of SPT is to win the Gold Bracket. There will be a first pool round, that will determine whether you play in the Gold Pool or Silver Pool.

Once you know what pool you are in, you will play in another pool to determine your seeding.

The brackets will work just like regular bracket. I will use random.org to determine your place in each pool.

[Here is a mock-up of how the tourney will work](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AuxQbLhF7RiedGFYajk2NUJhNUE3amVjLVhlUmdWQ3c#gid=0)

You will need to pay 500 gold to participate. Payouts will go to the top 4 in the Gold and Silver Pools, and will be decided shortly.

Please leave all questions in the comments or submit them to /r/Scrollspt

Sign-ups will be on /r/Scrollspt soon.

Feel free to PM me with suggestions, or if you wish to help, as I know things will have to be changed once we get up and running.

The deck, if it matters, is as follows:

__

3x Honorable General

3x Royal Vanguard

3x Knight Scholar

3x Royal Spearman

3x Ducal Spearman

3x Royal Skirmisher

3x Ducal Skirmisher

2x Ducal Infantryman [more on this later]

3x Mangonels

__

3x Focus

3x Pother

3x Transposition

3x Blessing of Haste

3x Flip

3x Speed

3x Imperial Resources

3x Kabonk

__

Pretty standard, I think. Instead of 2x Infantryman I've run 2x Pushback or New Orders, both of which have their uses, but recently decided I need some more creatures - especially for board presence early. Even tried Sinmarked Zealots once...

While deck criticism would be appreciated, since I'm always looking to make it better, I'm wondering what types of strategies I must be incorrectly following.

For instance, I pretty much *never* sack Imperial Resources. Is it more expendable than I treat it? I also tend to get rid of Mangonels all the time and then often not have them when needed, yet when I hang onto them they tend to go unused. I definitely need to learn how to better use them, especially in conjunction with Speed - which I tend to use more on Generals, thus making it even more rare for me to be able to pull off the Mangonel/Speed combo more than *maybe* once per game.

I know this is a lot of info to read with vague questions, but general Order tips would be much appreciated.

I have completed a new mod, and I'm looking for people to test it for me and figure out how it's best used. The mod is called TimerChange, and it allows you to set the turn timer to any value (lower than the default 90). You can also enable a total match timer - when this runs out of time you automatically surrender (in effect, losing the game).

The idea is to enable faster and different ways of playing, and to be able to practice against the AI under the regular time pressure (just set the timer to 90).

The Scrollsguide forum topic for the mod is here: http://www.scrollsguide.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=61&amp;t=2338

The source code for the mod is available here: https://github.com/ahockersten/ScrollsTimerChange

The latest DLL is available for download from here: https://github.com/ahockersten/ScrollsTimerChange/releases
(it will be in the official repository if/when it is approved, you know precompiled mods from untrusted sources can do horrible things, right?)

You setup this mod before matches in the chat, by typing for example:

/timerchange 15 (sets a 15 second turn timer and no total timer)

/timerchange 20 15:00 (sets a 20 second turn timer and a 15 minute total timer)

There is no coordination or synchronization between clients, so if you and your friend wants to run a match where you both have 15 second turn timers, you need to set that up separately before the game. I might add something like this later but since it would not be secure against cheating anyway (anyone could modify the mod) it hasn't been a priority.

I haven't figured out what the best way to use this mod is yet, but 10 second/turn matches against the Easy AI are pretty fun. You learn to make decisions on what to sac/play FAST (and easy is suddenly not so easy any more).

It is of course assuming both players have decent starting hands.

1. You cannot choose to take dmg directly to your idol and let your early creatures live (in magic, you could, thereby allowing you to mitigate the first-to-go advantage and letting your creature live to compete for board dominance early/mid game)

2. If a 2 turn attack unit with 2-3 dmg comes out in the middle of the board, its incredibly difficult to avoid getting behind in the board dominance early game (assuming both players have removal/shock spells)

3. Early dominance on the board is difficult to overturn unless with a good pother (even as splash on another type) followed by surge or double quake (most good players wont put many creatures with 2 hp expecting them to live early mid game)

4. There aren't enough viable defensive or counter tactics against early dominance helped tremendously by who goes first. In Magic and other TCG, you can counterspell or put up very strong walls or defensive spells like potion of resistance. However, because of the mechanics of this game where you can simply ignore that one creature, pushback, root, pother, etc, it is not defendable against players who currently dominate the board. There aren't even spells that make the creatures immune to magic that will allow you to have a chance of gaining momentum mid game by putting say, iron golem in the middle of the board that will eventually come into effect 3 turns later.

It's come to that as a ranked energy player, its not even worth trying for a frustrating quick loss or long-drawn out eventual loss against growth players who ESPECIALLY benefit from being able to go first. Even if I have godly starting hand, if growth players have decent starting hand, he will establish early dominance and never let go (unless I get lucky pother + surge). Because the losers dont get much points, I've started to actually just surrender at turn 2-3 if I go second against growth players who've had some decent early drops.

I know this games in beta, and there are balance issues to work, but what could be the solutions to this advantage first-to-go players have, more so than ANY other TCG I've ever played.

Potential solutions I came up with:
1. Increase the cooldown by 1 for the first one or two units the first player plays
2. Decrease the hp of all 5 idols by 1-2 for the first player
3. Free 1st energy to the second player (too extreme I know, this means shifting the first player unless the first player has a 1 drop creature that can be played right away)

Keep in mind, I dont think drawing extra card will do much as it is about how fast you can put out creatures to compete for the board dominance.

So far I've yet to play many ranked games, regardless of having nearly every card, I want to settle on a deck type before getting serious about climbing the ladder.

Gravelocks obviously have great synergy, and I don't see them all that often.  Just bear in mind I'm building this deck to climb the ladder, not compete at the top(yet!).  

If it helps I'll explain some of my logic behind the choices, but seeing as how this is a simple strat and many of the higher ranked folks here can probably deduce the reasoning behind the choices, feel free to skip this wall of text and tell me what I've done wrong :)

Dryadic Power: one of the only enchants I feel comfortable using, combined with outcasts it can make a strong wall.

Gravehawk:  Great if i can get a few gravelocks on the board, and relentless is always great.

Sand pact memorial:  I use 2 growth as a max cost anyway, so a mana ramp with a blocker is great.

Automata Forge:  Great card all around, whether as a wall or a diversion, people hate it and will waste dispersals or 2for1 it often.

Burn: staple of energy decks IMO.

Clockwork Library:  Not to sure about this, great card draw IF it goes off, i use it as a wall and diversion.

Copper Automaton:  A bit iffy on this, great burn card, but easily sniped and wasted.

Fury:  Great card, can turn a fight and clear the board.

Gravelock Elder: obvious card for this deck.

Gravelock Outcast:  Gotta love the regen on this guy, with a dryadic power it's better than a waking stone, and can bait a VD off an elder.

Gravelock Raider:  cheap critter with some potential.

Gun Automaton:  One I'm considering swapping...seems obvious for an energy deck but it doesn't add a whole lot to this strat.

Hellspitter Mortar:  Standard wall, i run 2 to fit an extra library.

Iron Whip:  It's a burn, it's a buff, it's a haste!  To versatile to give up.

Scattergunner:  Another standard energy critter, but another I was considering swapping for something bigger.

Thundersurge:  To great at low levels, almost as good as quake, and oftentimes better imo.

Tribal Memorial:  Not to sure about this, seems obvious, but i only ever need 2 growth, so it feels wasted alot.

Violent Dispersal:  The only straight 1:1 card in the game, and works wonders when a player gets enchant heavy.

Some cards i was considering adding:  

Fertile Soil- Energy needs card draw, but adding it would split my resources even more.

Crimson Bull- Board wide buff would be great for the aggro style i'm going for.

Blind Rage- Can stall or burn a group, but if an opponent plays around thundersurge, this will be much less useful as well.

Sorry if this was a long post, but i really like the idea of a gravelock deck, and would like some input to help me get over ladder anxiety to play this :)  I would really love to hear the weaknesses this deck has.",,False,self,t5_2scq0,False,,,True,t3_1hw218,http://www.reddit.com/r/Scrolls/comments/1hw218/help_me_tweak_a_gravelock_deck/,

* More detailed profiles. I’d like to see Rated Wins/Losses. Right now it just tracks wins and surrenders (is that a bug? I have a ton of surrenders from playing challenges).

* Friends list. Guilds/clans would be nice, too.

* Sort cards in deck builder.  Among other much-needed sorting featuress: Sort/filter by casting cost, sort/filter  by rarity, sort/filter by type (like creature, structure),  filter by undecked (“extra cards you’re not using”), filter by extra copies (cards you have &gt;3).

Some ideas have been taking the current packs out of circulation when the next one comes out.   But I dont think they are going to be able to make and balance new packs fast enough for that to be much fun unless they kidnap a dozen guys from Magic the Gatherings R&amp;D department.  
I was thinking it might be good to add a way to get rid of unwanted cards.   Like in guildwars 2 when the economy got temporary out of control (due to bots, right after fixing that issue) they added a temporary way to get all that excess stuff out of the system. Maybe we need something similar, a way to burn 3-4 of rarity Z to get one card of Z+1. And then at the highest level maybe 2-3 rares for another rare. This causes the cheapest cards to suddenly be bought up and removed from circulation helping to shake up supply and demand. Maybe also 5-6 of a certain color will produce a next rank card of that color?

My main problem with it is that it gets you card advantage without having to outplay your opponent on the board. Normally without this card, if you're opponent is 5 cards ahead of you, it means that they must have outplayed you and got some favourable trades earlier in the game. Winperials is just a magic spell that gives you that advantage without having to out play your opponent at all. 

You can be making even trades all game and then your opponent plays 2-3 imperials and they shoot ahead in card advantage to a point where it is impossible to catch them (unless you also have it in your deck). This is super frustrating to play against and it feels unfair. My opponent didn't capitalize on my mistakes...he just played a magic card advantage spell with nothing I could do against it. 

You could also say that fertile soil is the same but I don't really have a problem with it. I'm not sure why, but it just doesn't feel as scary when you're playing against someone and they use fertile soil a few times. Perhaps it's because it doesn't give you as big of an advantage, or that it doesn't give you resources as well, or maybe it's because growth doesn't have as many insane combos for clearing the board in the late game. I don't know. 

I'd be interested to hear what other people think of these 2 cards. Overall I think it feels much fairer if your opponent can only get card advantage by destroying your units and outplaying you on the board. Quake is much less frustrating that Winperials to me.

Before anyone even mentions Pother, I don't have it. I will put Pother in when I have three of them.

Order:

3x Powerbound--because Tethered Recruit needs to die for the +1 order also, something to sack when I don't need it anymore.

3x Heritage--card draw and because you want Decay to die.

3x Summons--Miasma Well or Waking Stones will only run one or the other.

3x Puri--Because why not?

3x Kabonk--for a while, I took this one out because of Languid. Then I remembered Kabonk kills tiny creatures.

Decay:

3x Mangy Rat--because poison and easy to kill. Also cheap.

3x Husk--honestly, this one just fills in for another 1 drop. I picked him over Staggering Muck because Staggering seems a bit too unreliable, plus I'm running Soul Steal.

3x Infected Gravelock--a pseudo-structure, really. Also, poison.

3x Tethered Recruit--duh.

3x Languid--card draw and making Braves useless. Also making Ilmire Hunters useless.

3x Miasma Well--with all the poison I am running, I figured I'd run it.

3x Blight Bearer--Moar Poison.

3x Lumbering Muckhead--do I need explain?

3x Brainlice--the more I look at this card, the more I don't see it working out as much as I think it should. Still, poison and cards.

2x Soul Steal--to sack Powerbound/Heritaged Tethered. Or to eat your Sister of the Fox or Veatter. Why Staggering Muckhead is not in the deck.

3x Ilmire Hunter--this will probably be killing more things than Lumbering Muckhead.

3x Damning Curse--Yes.

So, for any of you who will ask: how come no Oblivion Seeker, Cursemonger, Life Stealer, or Witchdoctor? Why would I run Oblivion Seeker when I already have so many smaller cards that give me a more immidiate effect? Why run Cursemonger when Lumbering, Hunter, Poison and Damning Curse will kill everything anyway? Why run Witchdoctor if you have only 3 human creatures in your deck?

This would be useful if you have a board full of units with 2 health with a countdown of 0 AND you want to play Quake.  Of course in this scenario after the opponent's turn is over those units would all die from the spell wearing off and their health decreasing to 0, but it would be a heck of a play.

A friend of mine has got me thinking about a new game mode.  
In card games like magic, after a match, you can switch the decks for a rematch, to mix things up. Now, in scrolls, that is currently not possible, thus I hereby suggest this new game mode:

**Best of three**  
Before you start a match, you select a deck, your opponent selects a deck, as usual.  
Now, the *first* game, you use your deck, your opponent his.  
The second game, *your decks are switched*, i.e. you use his deck, he uses your deck.  
If one player managed to win two times, the match ends and he wins.  
Otherwise, a final, deciding game will be played: Here, both can *choose, which of the two decks they want to use*.",,False,self,t5_2scq0,1376059329.0,,flair-energy,True,t3_1k0yum,http://www.reddit.com/r/Scrolls/comments/1k0yum/game_mode_idea_best_of_three/,

A few people in general-1 mentioned one idea that I thought seemed interesting (if the devs have time to implement), so I thought why not share it here.

**Scroll Gambling (name subject to change)**

Here's the overall idea. 

1. Like crafting you place three of a single scroll (or 3 different scrolls of the same rarity) in the crafting area, but instead of an upgraded scroll you'll get a random scroll of that rarity.

1. Another idea, similar to how rune crafting works in LOL is where you craft up to 5 scrolls of a rarity and get a scroll above that. Rares would still only require 3 scrolls to get another random rare (ex. commons require 4 commons to make 1 uncommon and 5 uncommons to make a single rare). 

That's really it for that. It's just something else for those that aren't into actually crafting and have many extra scrolls that they can't sell/trade in market (store doesn't pay a good return at all) or like the idea of gambling scrolls to obtain better scrolls. 

Now here's a slight concern from myself and some in the community.

**Gold earned per game isn't enough for losers or A.I. matches**

This is only a minor problem for me, but may be a large problem for those who will get the game in the future or think the game is more of a ""grind"" than being a fun CCG. ATM there's not many players playing quick match or ranked match, so many people are resorting to A.I. matches. After the introduction to double gold day, it got myself (along with others) thinking that maybe something like this should be more of a frequent thing to keep people playing, and not feel like playing the A.I. or even against actual people is anyway pointless or annoying. Here's a few adjustments/ideas that I think could help with the game.

*  Increasing gold for losers in ranked or quick match by 100g (adjusted for time played) for staying, and award no gold (or a penalty of 50g for match earnings) for forfeiting. Quitting should be discouraged, and it shouldn't be detrimental to someone who wins a match because of a person quitting right before a win or just because of bad draws. *cough* Mulligan *cough* :D 
* Adjusted rates for A.I. matches. An additional 50g for easy, 75g for medium, and 100g more for hard wins vs the A.I.
* Daily bonus gold (similar to a first win of the day bonus)
*or a double gold day once a week. 

A slightly long post, but just a few things to address the concerns of some people in the community, and of course if you have any comments or suggestions feel free to let me know. 

tl;dr A new gold sink idea similar to LOL's rune crafting system with scrolls instead, and gold adjustments for losing games or playing the A.I. 

Edit: Reworked the crafting idea based on feedback.

If your rook is staring down the enemy king and the only thing between them is an opponent's piece, your opponent isn't allowed to move that piece. It's said to be ""pinned"" to that spot. That gives you the opportunity to take it if it's stuck in a vulnerable position.  Similarly in scrolls, once you have two of your opponent's idols down, your opponent is forced to play units in front of each remaining idol to stop you from winning, instead of playing his units where he would like to.

This can potentially turn into an advantage for you. Take out the outside idols and your opponent has to clump up in the middle making easy pickings for lobbers and thundersurge. Kill the top and second-top idol and you have a safe buffer to play units away from your opponent.

The problem of course, is that taking down two idols isn't easy.  You'll probably have to sacrifice board presence to pull it off, which begs the question of whether the payout is worth the cost.
