**Administrative Notes:**

* Later today, an omnibus post will go up in the sidebar that will link to all posts relevant to the current study group.  Just go there whenever you are looking for stuff related to the current Learn JS Properly study group.

* This group will last 7 weeks.

* This study group is based on [this track at JavaScriptIsSexy.com](http://javascriptissexy.com/how-to-learn-javascript-properly/).  This is a new session for the group the author mentions in that post.

* **I encourage you to use the IRC chatroom (linked in the sidebar) at #learnjavascript**.  I plan to hang out in there at least a few hours each week during this session.

* New posts announcing that week's assignments will go up every Monday (sorry this one is not going up on a Monday).

* Feel free to post your questions in this subreddit.  There are a lot of people who know a lot of JS hanging around here.

-----------

**Getting Ready for Week 1 (""Assignments""):**

(1)  Go browse through the JavaScriptIsSexy link posted above.

(2)  Acquire a copy of **either** of the two following books: 

* If you are a total web development n00b, I'd recommend [this book](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596805527/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0596805527&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=interhaptic-20).

* If you know a bit about web development, [you can buy this one **instead**](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006PW2URI/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B006PW2URI&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=interhaptic-20).

(3)  Sign up for an accounts on Stack Overflow.

(4)  Sign up for an account on Codecademy.

(5)  Watch [Discover DevTools](http://discover-devtools.codeschool.com/).  This is important!

Anyways, without further ado...

-----

**FIRST WEEK ASSIGNMENTS:**

1.  If you don't know HTML/CSS pretty well, do the [Web Fundamentals track on Codecademy]( http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/web). 

2.  Read the Preface and Chapters 1 and 2 of JavaScript: The Definitive Guide **OR** read the Introduction and Chapters 1 and 2 of Professional JavaScript for Web Developers.

3.  Work through section 1 of [the JS Track on Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript).

4.  Make a least one comment in this thread about something you learned, found interesting, or didn't understand very well.

**HOW TO DO THE ASSIGNMENTS (IMPORTANT!):**

You're not going to get much out of the reading if all you do is read.  You need to type out all of the example code you encounter in the textbooks in either the Chrome or Firefox console or in [JSfiddle](http://www.jsfiddle.net).   **If you need help figuring out how to use your console or JSfiddle, post below**.  Ideally, you will play with and tweak this code. 

---------
**Miscellaneous stuff about keeping the class social:**  

* If you post a question on /r/LearnJavaScript that relates to these materials/the study group, mark your post with **[JS Properly study group]** or something similar, plz!  I will do this the random (non-mandatory) stuff I will add during the week.

* [IRC Channel]( http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=learnjavascript)

I've decided that we should mostly follow the [""How to Learn JavaScript Properly""]( http://javascriptissexy.com/how-to-learn-javascript-properly/) track.

If you want to be a part of the group, read the link.  **I will begin posting formal assignments on the upcoming Monday.** I will probably, at times, supplement the track with an additional blog post or two or replace parts of it with other resources.


**GETTING STARTED BEFORE MONDAY:**

If you are a total web development n00b, you can [buy this book](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596805527/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0596805527&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=interhaptic-20) or it is [freely available here]( http://www.abaco.edu.pe/biblioteca/manuales/Programacion%20Web/JavaScript/JavaScript%20The%20Definitive%20Guide.pdf).

Also, sign up for accounts on Stack Overflow and Codecademy!

**Bonus assignment before Monday**: Read Chapters 1-4 of [Eloquent JavaScript](http://www.eloquentjavascript.net).

* I will put up a weekly assignment in /r/LearnJavaScript every Monday for the next 6 weeks.

* There is an IRC chat at [#learnjavascript]( http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=learnjavascript).  I plan to start averaging about an hour a day hanging out in there.  I encourage you to, too.

* You can PM /u/Hypnotix to join his Skype study group - send him your Skype username.

* I added more work to Week 1 than we had in the previous session.  I did this to more evenly distribute the work over the 7 weeks -- I think a lot of people dropped out last time because there was a lot more work in the later weeks.  If you feel I am assigning too much, please leave feedback.

**FIRST WEEK ASSIGNMENTS:**

0. Watch [Discover DevTools]( http://discover-devtools.codeschool.com/) if you have not already.

**WEEK 2 REQUIRED ASSIGNMENTS:**

1.  Read chapters 3, 4, and 5 of JavaScript: The Definitive Guide **OR** chapters 3 and 4 and the preface of Professional JavaScript for Web Developers.

2.  Work through sections 2 - 5 of the [JavaScript track on Codecademy](
  http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript).

3.  Solve either Project Euler [Problem 1](http://projecteuler.net/problem=1) or [Problem 2](http://projecteuler.net/problem=2).  Feel free to solve both.  

4. To prepare for Week 3, read the blog post [JS Objects in Detail]( http://javascriptissexy.com/javascript-objects-in-detail/.  If you want to work ahead, [this is the general roadmap I'm using to make these assignments](http://javascriptissexy.com/how-to-learn-javascript-properly/).

**Don't forget:** You should be typing out lots of example code in the console or in [JSFiddle](http://www.jsfiddle.net).  You're not going to learn nearly as much if you don't actually type it out with your own fingers.

**ADMINISTRATIVE STUFF:**

I have heard the complaints about keeping track of things.  I am going to create **ONE** omnibus self.post for this study group.  I will update the omnibus self.post with links to the various threads, including every formal assignment thread (like this one).  **A link to this omnibus post will be posted in the sidebar, under the ""Study Groups"" heading.  If you are ever trying to find out what the assignments are, go to this link in the sidebar.**  I will also include links to the other random threads that we create there.

I've (mostly) come up with a relatively fast-paced plan for the next 4 weeks.  I'll post an assignment every Monday - [Eloquent JS] is probably a good tag for stuff related to this group.

Without further ado - **Week 0 assignments:**

* [Eloquent JavaScript, Chapters 1 through 5](http://eloquentjavascript.net/contents.html).  Next week will be Chapters 6 and 7.  

* [ Developing Google Chrome Extensions](http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/developing-google-chrome-extensions/). Can you get one up and running?  I am making this one of my own projects this week, so hopefully we all learn together.  There are lots of seasoned programmers lurking if we need help.  

* If you don't know how to use Chrome's developer tools, watch [Discover Dev Tools]( http://discover-devtools.codeschool.com/). 

What should we do next week?  Show off greasemonkey scripts?  Or can anybody think of a good project that involves data structures?

My name's Meo. I've been an active JavaScript developer since before exiting college. I have roughly 3 1/2 years of JavaScript experience underneath my belt and 4 years of C#/C++/C OOP experience. 

If you're reading this, hopefully you're one of two persons: a newcomer to JavaScript who wants some advice on syntax, structuring, best practices and 'how do I do ___ with jQuery or CSS.' If you are that type of person... feel free to hit me up anytime with questions. I'm on the computer pretty much 24/7 and am more than happy to work with you and your code. I have extensive experience TA'ing multiple computer science programming courses throughout college and am not a stranger to 'tutoring' in computer science.

Okay, that said... **I need some mentoring, too.** I'm a bit in over my head with a personal project of mine. [I've created a Google Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/streamus/jbnkffmindojffecdhbbmekbmkkfpmjd) which is starting to take on a life of its own. I've written it, from scratch and by myself, in my free time over the last year. 

It is partially written with BackboneJS, but the UI elements have not been converted to such a framework. It leverages RequireJS to implement the AMD module pattern. I've implemented some basic test cases using Jasmine, but I honestly have &lt;1% test coverage. The backend is written using C# with the MVC3 framework, an MSSQL database and NHibernate to map the DB to classes.

Are you a senior developer in those fields? Boy would I love to braindump on you and get feedback. Streamus' architecture is becoming... expansive... and I would like to sanity check my layout with someone else. Things can go so awry when working alone for a year :) I'd like to discuss my applications fragile spots, my concerns, etc... and decide what steps need to be taken to make the project more resilient before it becomes more popular.

I'm not actually expecting you to do any programming. I don't really need help with that anymore.. just discussing architecture and design decisions with someone who has maybe made a successfully app before.

That's all I got. Let me know if either of those sound interesting to you.

Thanks for reading,

Hi, everybody.  I've really enjoyed doing this, and I plan to run another, more interactive session, and with more support (it helps that I've done it now...), soon.  So if you've been standing by or believe you joined too late, just hang out -- there will be a 2nd session soon.  I also think there will be a ""Learn Backbone"" session coming up.  Without further ado...

**ASSIGNMENTS:**

1.  Read **either** chapters 9, 18, 21, and 22 of JavaScript the Definitive Guide **or**  16, 22, and 24 of Professional JavaScript for Web Developers. 

2.  Improve Your Quiz Application Even Further:

— Use [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/)    for the entire page layout, including the quiz elements to make it look more professional. As an added bonus, use the tabs user interface component from Twitter Bootstrap and show 4 different quizzes, one on each tab.

— [Learn Handlebars.js]( http://javascriptissexy.com/handlebars-js-tutorial-learn-everything-about-handlebars-js-javascript-templating/)  and add Handlebars.js templating to the quiz. You should no longer have any HTML in your JavaScript code. Your quiz is getting more advanced bit by bit.

— Keep a record of all the users who take the quiz and show each user how her score ranks amongst the scores from other quiz takers.

**Who are you?**

You've been working for 20 years and are learning programming to change jobs, you're a kid just learning to program, you're a computer science student looking for some real world project experience, or you're trying to start a startup at some point in the future but need to become a better programmer first.

**Why?**

From personal experience, both as a mentee (student) and a mentor, mentoring is an extremely awesome way to go about learning programming, and especially to supplement the *tons* of existing resources that are already out there.

Having access to a mentor enables you to get help quickly, break through sticking points in your building/learning, and ultimately build more cool stuff.

I would like to help connect experienced developers who want to help out aspiring programmers, or even experienced programmers just looking to pick up a new language (e.g. a rubyist trying to learn javascript).

Existing methods of finding mentors are not easy or user friendly in any way. And unfortunately, if you are lucky enough to find one, it's extremely easy for the relationship to fizzle out just as quick as it began - and then the motivation dies off and you find yourself regressing :(


-------

**To potential mentors**

Potential mentors - hopefully a few potential mentees will comment below and explain why they would love to have you so much - but let me try. Not only is mentoring extremely self-rewarding (and studies have actually shown that helping others will make you happy - I personally believe if you want to help others selflessly that's amazing, but if you do it because it makes you happier then there's nothing wrong with that!), but will also give you access to an inspiring and dedicated individual who will be able to give you not only energy, but also feedback and ideas on your own projects.

------

**What will this cost.**

**$0.00** (No catches. Mentors will be volunteers, and mentees will not pay)

Later on to ensure that this stays alive, I'll explore ways of making money, but the core mentorship offering will always be accessible for free to driven individuals. And ultimately I'd really love to be running a program like this!  

-------

**How will this be structured?**

That's something that I'm currently working out. I've worked on two mentorship programs with Stanford University (one that I started, and one that I work on the team of), but I can really use your help with suggestions and ideas, especially in how we can make this as amazing an experience as possible for the mentors, and also how we can entice and attract more mentors.

-----

**What's the status?**

I already have a few mentors and mentees that have expressed interest! I think to keep the experience as good as possible, I'll do the first class with a specific language only - so please do fill out the survey below if you want to be a mentor or mentee and indicate that you are interested in JavaScript and whatever other language you want to learn or teach :)


**What now? How can you help?**

If you could use this service, let me know! Comment below, do the survey, hire a blimp to send me a message, etc :)

Indicate that you want JavaScript and help me work out what people need most by filling this out.

I'll need a bunch of people to fill this out - but the fact is that large groups are always made up of lone individuals! *Your* response alone will make a difference, and will help me shape the program in a direction that is useful for *you*.

If you have experience running mentoring programs, being mentored with programming, or mentoring students before, please send me a message on reddit or email me with [myusername]@stanford.edu

*Cheers guys*

- [Head First JavaScript](http://my.safaribooksonline.com/book/programming/javascript/9780596527747),  a lighter, but solid read.

- [Professional JS for Web Developers]( http://it-ebooks.info/read/1820/).  This book is comprehensive (i.e. really long).

- [Eloquent JavaScript](http://www.eloquentjavascript.net).  Pithy, amusing at times, great mix of web + raw programming.

&gt;*""[...] a structured and insightful road map on how you should learn JavaScript properly and thoroughly.""*

**It's less than $60 for the books, and will take 5-6 weeks of dedication.**


___

***Why are we doing this?*** 
-
Well, I'm a self-taught front-end developer, and want to deepen my knowledge of one of the most fundamental tools in my line of work. Doing so will provide a boost of self-confidence in my abilities, and help me to do a better job at the startup where I work.

Erica has written her fair-share of PHP back in the day, and wants to get back into programming. JavaScript is a simple place to start :-)

***What would happen if you completed this course too?***
-
&gt;*""You [will be] incredibly knowledgeable on the JavaScript programming language, go build modern web applications, a startup, or get an exciting job making a handsome salary near six figures or more.""*

Please send help?,14,4,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/learnjavascript/comments/1hs1x4/im_trying_to_learn_javascript_but_i_have_no_idea/,"Sorry if the answer to this is kind of obvious, but I've been looking at a lot of different websites, and I still don't have a clear understanding.

I know a very small amount of Javascript. I probably wouldn't be able to create anything meaningful with it, but I can work with it enough to add and edit things like flexslider or lightbox. I primarily only work on front end web development. Most everything that I find myself needing for a site can usually be found pre-made by someone else on the web.

Since this is the case, will I be at a strong loss if I don't delve further into JS? The tutorials that I'm reading about online are all great and easy enough to follow (Codecademy and Tizag primarily), yet, as I progress through them, it's hard to retain all the information since I can't think of a single practical application for anything that I'm learning. My focus is on design...what do I need with a pop-up window? In what scenario am I going to have to ask the visitor to tell me their name? I'm not saying they're universally irrelevant, but I don't see what they can do for me personally.  In the meantime, all the Javascript that I find that deals with aesthetics seems a lot more complex than the basic stuff that I'm learning.  

So I'm not sure where to go with this. My terminology is probably off since, like I said, I'm not super familiar with JS, but are there any beginner tutorials that focus on the ""visual""/""point and click interactivity"" element of the language as opposed to the, ""Retrieve a name and add these two variables together"" element of the language? Is there any way to start directly working with images and visuals as opposed to so much textual information?

And if there is no good way to jump directly into that, is there anything that I can learn about backend or frontend development to help me contextualize the things that I *can* learn right now? I've learned to change the color of text, do alerts, add numbers, do counting and lists...yet I don't have a firm grasp on why I or many other people would ever need or want to do this. And yet almost every tutorial seems to want to show you these things. Why?

Sorry if this post is difficult to follow. I just don't have too much of an idea of what I'm doing here. Please give me a hand if you can.

**In this thread:** 

Post about how it's going, what you're struggling with, etc.  

If you've written solutions to Project Euler 1 or 2, post them below.  **Read and critique each other's answers.**

If you're found any good resources, post links!

**Finally, extra credit for this week**:  Chapters 7 and 8 of [Eloquent JavaScript](http://www.eloquentjavascript.net//contents.html).  But only read this if you've already read Chapters 1-6.  If you haven't done that, finish those first.  

Note: Eloquent JS is a hard book to read if you're new to programming.  Do not feel stupid if you're struggling, or if you're not ready to read Chapters 7 or 8 this week.  One approach I have taken with it is: If I can't understand three paragraphs in a row (like, at all), I start googling around.

I'm sure this will all come to me with time and experience as I do more coding, but I would really appreciate any links to good articles on the topic that other people have found helpful.

	if (choice1 === choice2);
	return(""The result is a tie!"");

			position: 0,
			items: [{
				position: 0,
				text: 'Clear Queue',
				onClick: function () {
					self.clear();
				}
			}]
		});

		ContextMenuView.show({
			top: event.pageY,
			left: event.pageX + 1
		});

		return false;
	}

The idea is that you can leverage bubbling up contextmenu events from nested views. Each view calls .addGroup and adds the items it wants / references to corresponding functions. The topmost parent view calls show and returns false to stop the default contextmenu event.

I would love to have feedback on anything and everything. My coding style, my commenting, my Backbone usage... if you have any questions or comments on why I did anything, feel free to ask. I'm very active here / elsewhere on Reddit. :)

Hello!

I'm going to post some code which represents a PlaylistItem's View. A Playlist could have thousands of PlaylistItems. As such, it's important to make sure my PlaylistItem's render method is as efficient as possible. Currently, I'm applying some modifications to the DOM element after I've set its HTML. I would like some help changing my code such that the initial HTML set is all that is necessary.

[Here's a much more reading-friendly Gist!](https://gist.github.com/MeoMix/6224386)

	define([
		'utility'
	], function (Utility) {
		'use strict';

		var PlaylistItemView = Backbone.View.extend({
			tagName: 'li',
			
			className: 'playlistItem',
			
			template: _.template($('#playlistItemTemplate').html()),
			
			render: function() {
				this.$el.html(this.template(this.model.toJSON()));
				
				//  TODO: Probably renamed this to playlistitemid to avoid confusion with listitem's id.
				this.$el.attr('data-itemid', this.model.get('id'));

				var videoDuration = this.model.get('video').get('duration');
				var author = this.model.get('video').get('author');

				var playlistItemInfo = Utility.prettyPrintTime(videoDuration) + ' by ' + author;
				this.$el.find('span.playlistItemInfo').text(playlistItemInfo);

				Utility.scrollElementInsideParent(this.$el.find('span.playlitItemTitle'));

				return this;
			},
			
			initialize: function() {
				this.listenTo(this.model, 'destroy', this.remove);
			}

		});

		return PlaylistItemView;
	});


And here's Utility.js:

	//  Provides helper methods for non-specific functionality.
	define({

		scrollElementInsideParent: function(element) {
			//  Scroll the element if its too long to read.
			$(element).mouseover(function () {
				var distanceToMove = $(this).width() - $(this).parent().width();

				$(this).animate({
					marginLeft: ""-"" + distanceToMove + ""px""
				}, {
					//  Just a feel good value; scales as the text gets longer
					duration: 15 * distanceToMove,
					easing: 'linear'
				});

			}).mouseout(function () {
				$(this).stop(true).animate({ marginLeft: 0 });
			});
		},       

		//  Takes a time in seconds and converts it to a displayable format of H:mm:ss or mm:ss.
		prettyPrintTime: function(timeInSeconds) {
			if (isNaN(timeInSeconds)) {
				timeInSeconds = 0;
			}

			var hours = Math.floor(timeInSeconds / 3600);
			var remainingSeconds = timeInSeconds % 3600;

			var minutes = Math.floor(remainingSeconds / 60);
			remainingSeconds = remainingSeconds % 60;

			//  These lines ensure two-digits
			if (minutes &lt; 10) {
				minutes = ""0"" + minutes;
			}

			if (remainingSeconds &lt; 10) {
				remainingSeconds = ""0"" + remainingSeconds;
			}

			var timeString = minutes + ':' + remainingSeconds;

			if (hours &gt; 0) {
				timeString = hours + ':' + timeString;
			}

			return timeString;
		}

	});


Here's the PlaylistItem Template:

	&lt;script type=""text/template"" id=""playlistItemTemplate""&gt;
		
		&lt;div class=""playlistItemVideoImage"" style=""background-image: url(http://img.youtube.com/vi/&lt;%- video.get('id')%&gt;/default.jpg)""&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;
		
		&lt;div class=""textWrapper""&gt;
			&lt;span class=""playlistItemTitle""&gt;&lt;%- title %&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
			&lt;span class=""playlistItemInfo""&gt;&lt;!--Set inside render to utilize utility.js--&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	
	&lt;/script&gt;

What do you guys think of the code? And what do you guys think I should be doing to optimize while also maintaining code clarity?

I plan to introduce lazy-loading for the background-image such that I don't incur image loads until needed the image is visible. Do you guys see anything else obviously terrible?

I have a small project in mind and would like some advice. I want to create a password protected website where the homepage looks like an table of contents for a book (expandable/collaspable). The chapters are countries and the sections are cities. 

I would then have add/remove/edit which would alter the sections. 

Add would bring up a blank web form. The webform could be filled out and submitted. Once submitted, it would create a new page and all the information from the form would be located in this new page in certain locations with certain formatting. This added city would then also be added to the table of countents and linked to this page.


Remove would delete a city chosen from a dropdown menu.


Edit would bring up a prefilled web form from one of the already existing cities you have selected. You can add or edit the data in the web form and resubmit it.

This is the basic concept with smaller things I will add over time.

My questions are:
1) Is this just using HTML and JS?
2) Is this a fairly easy project? Could I learn all the coding needed to create this within a month or two? (I have some programming experience from universtiy, but not much.)
3) What sort of special techniques/functions/etc would I need to know for this?
4) Would I be able to achieve a lot of this through cut/paste from sources online?

Sorry for such a long post, but thank you in advance for any help.

I figured this might be a place for people to try to talk about their understanding of this and perhaps correct misunderstandings that we have.  

I see that the 
    for in loop
method allows me to loop through and state all of the properties of an object.   The big concern with using for in loops is that they will return inherited properties.  So it is a good idea to filter them out (ie. extend() function).  Similarly, hasOwnProperty() checks to see if something is a property of an object, but not inherited.  Lastly, ""The enumerable attribute specifies whether the property name is returned by a
for/in loop"" (Javascript the Definitive Guide)  So The propertyIsEnumerable() refines the hasOwnProperty() test. ""It returns true only if the named property is an own property and its enumerable attribute is true.""
-Question:  what is the value of properties having the attribute/characteristic of enumerability?  Why would I sometimes not want something to show up in a for in loop?

Next I want to bring up the concept of getters and setters.  I think they are a method??(Function inside an object).  They can be helpful to reset the value a property.  Is this the functional use of them?

Last topic that I want to discuss is the Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor() function and Object.defineProperties.  The first allows you to see the four attributes of a property.  If you are working with a data property (think value) then the four attributes are: value, writable, enumerable, and configurable.  If you are working with a accessor property(think method/function/getter&amp;setter)  the four attributes are:  get, set, enumerable, and configurable.
To me it seems that these tools are helpful when creating libraries (granted that you there is some value in adjusting the default of these attributes).  What about other uses?  Any ideas?

Okay, thats what I wanted to talk about, what misunderstandings do I have, what questions do you have?

I'm coming from a background in ActionScript, and I've learned only the basics of JavaScript, which I've been using for some HTML5 canvas applications.

In Flash/AS3, I'm used to having the ability to store data in an external XML file, which can then be loaded and parsed to control aspects of the application.

I'm now looking to build an application using HTML5 canvas which will animate some objects according to certain parameter sets. I thought I'd store the parameters in an external XML file as I would in Flash - should I be using JSON instead? I envision the app being built with a drop down menu or combobox which would automatically populate according to the XML. When a selection is made with the combobox, animation parameters change.

I'm Googling away to learn how to do this, but I'm getting confused by all the information (especially since some of the information looks old and I'm not worried about, say, IE6 compatibility).

Source: https://github.com/mandeeps/CheerUp/blob/master/js/script.js

It displays the top photos in imgur's /r/aww gallery one at a time, in random order. It's intended for use on mobile so I've set it to preload a large number of images for offline use, but on lower res screens it will select smaller versions of the images to decrease data consumption. I know there are better approaches to this, just not sure what they are. 

You can see it in action here - it's called ['Cheer Up!'](http://mandeeps.github.io/CheerUp/) and that's what it does for me, at least when imgur responds... 

It's supposed to be installable as a Firefox/FirefoxOS/Firefox for Android hosted app (though I don't have hardware to test on beyond one Android phone running FF nightly), and can be saved to the homescreen on iOS+Android. 

There's a bunch of things I want to add to it later, like storing images as blobs in indexedDB instead of depending on the browser cache, letting users pick what gallery they want to see, and improving preloading performance by limiting how many are loaded at a time and only downloading more after the user has seen several photos. 

One problem I know of is that the ajax request to imgur can fail and that isn't being handled well at present.

This makes sense because jquery only runs once the page is first loaded, and doesn't react retroactively.

I added a bit of scripting that added all the classes that get applied at start, but the accordion effect doesn't get applied to new posts that are added. Which is strange, because I'd assume that the DOM the jquery references should be able to update when more content is added to the DOM.

Starting off I've encountered something that I need help to understand. 

I've made a constructor for player objects, and want to keep the score variable private.  I added methods to the object constructor to add to the score and to get the score. 

When adding the methods directly into the constructor like this:

    var Player = function(name){
        this.name = name;
    	var playerScore = 0;
        this.addToScore = function(rollScore){
            playerScore += rollScore;
        };
        this.getScore = function(){
            return playerScore;
        };
    };
    
    p1 = new Player(""Joe"");
    p1.addToScore(500);
    console.log(p1.getScore()); // this logs '500'

it seems to work fine. I'm able to access the score with my method.
But then I was reading that this way of adding methods might not be the best since I'm creating new function objects for those methods each time I create a new Player instance. So I wanted to try using the prototype way of adding them and tried this:

    var Player = function(name){
        this.name = name;
    	var playerScore = 0;
    };
    
    Player.prototype.addToScore = function(rollScore){
    	this.playerScore += rollScore;
    };
    Player.prototype.getScore = function(){
    	return this.playerScore;
    };
    
    
    p1 = new Player(""Joe"");
    p1.addToScore(500);
    console.log(p1.getScore()); // this logs 'NaN'


I'm sure I'm doing something pretty noobish, hope my question isn't too dumb, but why can't the second way access the playerScore variable?

I gave up on this particular problem after spending quite some time trying to finish it - I had been using the nested ""if / else"" syntax as suggested but I just could not get it working.  I proceeded with the course and a few modules later ""and/or/not"" was introduced so I backtracked and solved the problem using an ""and"" condition.

Suggested syntax:

    if (condition) {
        if (condition) {
            return ""some string"";
        } else {
            return ""some other string"";
        }
}

The solution I used (after being introduced to and/or):

	if (choice1 == choice2) {
		return(""The result is a tie!"");
	} else if (choice1 == ""rock"" &amp;&amp; choice2 == ""scissors"") {
			return(""rock wins"");
        }

I completed Part 2 with ease but Part 3 had me stumped completely until I used the &amp;&amp; syntax:

    var compare = function(choice1, choice2) {
	if (choice1 == choice2) {
		return(""The result is a tie!"");
	} if (choice1 == ""rock"") {
		if (choice2 == ""scissors"") {
			return(""rock wins"");
		} else {
			return(""paper wins"");

-------

**ASSIGNMENTS:**

\1.  Read either:

* Chapters 10, 14, and 17 of JavaScript: The Definitive Guide, or 

* Chapters 13 and 20 of Professional JS for Web Developers

\2. Make these improvements to your quizzes:

* Add client-side data validation: make sure the user answers each question before proceeding to the next question.

* Add a “Back” button to allow the user to go back and change her answer. The user can go back up to the first question. For the questions that the user has answered already, be sure to show the radio button selected, so that the user is not forced to answer the questions again, which she has completed.

*  Use jQuery to add animation (fade out the current question and fade in the next question).

([relevant link]( http://javascriptissexy.com/how-to-learn-javascript-properly/))

\3. Post a comment here with a link to a [JSfiddle](http://www.jsfiddle.net) or [Codepens]( http://www.codepen.io/pen/) demonstration of your quiz by next Monday.

\4.  Read at least one other person's quiz code.  Offer praise and constructive criticism!

https://github.com/raddevon/TheList/blob/dev/js/colorSlide.js

I have an unordered list of input fields that will ultimately make up an editable to-do list. The idea is that, when the user hovers over the input field, a colored div is injected into the DOM which will then animate cover the length of the input field. When the field is focused, this highlight will remain active until another field is focused. Unfortunately, that doesn't happen.

Here's where I activate the plugin for my input elements:

And here's the live list app so you can see how it (doesn't) work:

https://rawgithub.com/raddevon/TheList/dev/index.html

One thing I'm noticing is that my `this` variable seems to be pointing to the window. I'm guessing this is due to my plugin wrapper that gives the plugin the ability to chain. Assuming that's my problem (and I'm not sure it is), how can I get the currently selected element into my wrapper?

Currently to do so, they can click an image that then redirects to a duplicated page with a different background assigned in HTML, but I want to insert a JS script that will change the background on the same HTML page (this saves me from constantly duplicating the page and manually changing the background on each as I add more backgrounds, and also saves me updating all the links in the other pages)

I want the script to run when the user clicks a button (the button will actually be an image file I have designed).

I would like the script to randomly select a background from a folder with lots of images in it, all named uniformly e.g (bg1, bg2, bg3, bg4 etc), or even just to start on bg1 and move up while also eliminating chances of the same background being used twice, if possible.

My HTML background code is

      &lt;img src=""backgrounds/bg1.jpg"" alt=""bg"" id=""bg"" /&gt;

Here are three examples of code that work the same way to demonstrate: 

Ex1
---------------------------------
&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML&gt;
&lt;HTML&gt;

	&lt;HEAD&gt;
	&lt;/HEAD&gt;
	&lt;BODY&gt;
		&lt;SCRIPT&gt;
			var x = 100;
			var y = 100;
		&lt;/SCRIPT&gt;

		&lt;SCRIPT&gt;
			alert(x + y);
		&lt;/SCRIPT&gt;
	&lt;/BODY&gt;
&lt;/HTML&gt;

Ex2
---------------------------------
&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML&gt;
&lt;HTML&gt;

	&lt;HEAD&gt;
		&lt;SCRIPT&gt;
			var x = 100;
			var y = 100;
		&lt;/SCRIPT&gt;
	&lt;/HEAD&gt;
	&lt;BODY&gt;
		&lt;SCRIPT&gt;
			alert(x + y);
		&lt;/SCRIPT&gt;
	&lt;/BODY&gt;
&lt;/HTML&gt;

Ex3
---------------------------------
&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML&gt;
&lt;HTML&gt;

	&lt;HEAD&gt;
	&lt;/HEAD&gt;
	&lt;BODY&gt;
		&lt;SCRIPT&gt;
			var x = 100;
			var y = 100;
			alert(x + y);
		&lt;/SCRIPT&gt;
	&lt;/BODY&gt;
&lt;/HTML&gt;


So looking at all these, the variables x an y are defined in different places before being used in the 'alert'.  So it looks like variables that are declared withing one set of '&lt;script&gt;' tags are still usable within other sets of '&lt;script&gt;' tags, correct?  This doesn't jive with me for some reason, but is obviously the case. 

Are these then global variables?  Is it a best practice to set all these global variables as the first thing you do in a script? 

These varialbes will retain their values as long as the page is loaded?

Is there a way to send a variable into this to have access to it inside the success function?  I'm thinking that I will just have to parse my html for the information itself.

First of all let me say that I really like this subreddit, I've attended the first ""Learn Javascript Properly"" but not in it's entirety, and now I'm doing the Summer Session. (Actually that's why I registered in the first place)

It might seem silly of me (new to Javascript) but I would like some pointers in creating a really simple webapp, just to demonstrate and explain how all these technologies integrate together, and familiarize with some concepts. So here are my thoughts on a basic app. I know it's not optimal or follows any best practices, but hopefully you guys will help me figure things out! I understand that this is not stackoverflow, but my example is too generic to post in stackoverflow, and so far I don't need help with the coding, as much as I need help with the concepts, and fully grasping the underpinnings of a Web app.


Let's assume we have a web application for ordering beverages, and we wanna use Backbone, Nodejs+Express and MongoDB to store our data.

We are going to need 2 backbone models
One that represents the beverage


      Myapp.Models.Beverage = Backbone.Model.extend ({
          name: '',
          type:'',
          description:''
      });



And one that represents the order


     Myapp.Models.Order = Backbone.Model.extend({
         order_number: '',
         Table:'',  
         Beverages: [{
             name:'',
             quantity:''
         }]
     });

Now, if I've understood things correctly the app will present the user with an order view. In the order view, the user can input their table (for simplicity let's assume they know their table) They can also click a button that says: ""Add Beverage"" which will render the Beverage View and allow the user to select from a drop-down list the beverage they want and the quantity. Beverages (which are populated automatically from the DB) are stored in the database, and served in JSON using NodeJs+Express (but how this is done, is still beyond me). Also the user is able to filter through beverages by their type (long drink, cocktail, beer, wine, non-alcoholic) from another dropdown.


Is the above way of thinking correct, or am I fundamentally wrong? Maybe the order should be a collection of beverages (plus order number and table?) How would you organize your code around a something like this? I would appreciate explanations of concepts instead of dropping some code, specially on the backend stack (node+express), although both would be nice!


Questions: 
How do the conditional drop-downs work? This is the hardest part for me to grasp since everything is involved! The beverages are populated from the server that fetches them from the DB, and they are filtered out depending on the ""type"" dropdown, rendered into the view etc...",,False,self,t5_2tugi,False,,,True,t3_1hxmak,http://www.reddit.com/r/learnjavascript/comments/1hxmak/help_with_concepts_and_best_practices_for_a/,

The success callback just reloads the child with content within its parent, and it works perfectly. There will just be a random time that it will not run the javascript at all, and do the HTML's default submit behavior. 

The page that the forms link to DOES redirect back to the main page, but only if the 'ajax' property is absent from the 'data' sent from the javascript (i.e. the only way this would happen is if the js never ran). I can confirm that every time the JS ran at all, the ajax property was generated and received correctly, so the problem is completely to do with the form submission simply not being caught and handled by the JS.

I'm writing a JS/jQuery to-do list app for a class. My current stumbling block is a colored highlight effect that should trigger on `mouseenter` events for each item in the list. 

The list items will have a left border colored depending on the proximity of the due date. On `mouseenter`, the border color will expand out to the full width of the list item. I've accomplished this by injecting a `div` with a background color matching the left border and CSS transitioning it to the width of the trigger element.

The effect works just as I had hoped, but each of the list items animate the highlight on the first list item only. I know the problem, but I'm not sure of the best approach for a fix. The sliding color `div` is being created one time for the first element. Then, the other `li` elements are having their `mouseenter` events bound to animating that first `div`.

What's the best approach here to insure I create a distinct `div` for each of the list items? I'm sure there are some fundamental problems with the way I've written this, but I'd like to get input from some experienced coders to help me move in the right direction.",,False,self,t5_2tugi,False,,,True,t3_1eg4wd,http://www.reddit.com/r/learnjavascript/comments/1eg4wd/creating_new_elements_for_each_trigger_in_a/,

basically I have been doing web design for 2 months, haven't really gotten into Javascript but I do use it on my websites just by copy/pasting from google etc (all opensource)
Now here is the code I used on my most recent design:


    $(document).ready(function(){
        $('a[href^=""#""]').bind('click.smoothscroll',function (e) {
            e.preventDefault();

            var target = this.hash,
        $target = $(target);

        $('html, body').stop().animate({
        'scrollTop': $target.offset().top
        }, 900, 'swing', function () {
        window.location.hash = target;
        });
        });
    });


Quick Summary, it makes the page smoothscroll to a different part of the page when an anchor tag is pressed, I just know it does that, I don't know how though.
I probably won't delve into learning Javascript for a while but I would like a basic understanding just to get me by for a while.
If its not asking too much (it probably is) I was wondering if someone could give me a breakdown of each line (what bits do what etc).",,False,self,t5_2tugi,False,,,True,t3_1c2zqs,http://www.reddit.com/r/learnjavascript/comments/1c2zqs/explain_this_to_me_if_you_could_xpost_from/,

        if (document.danceform.tempo[i].checked==true){

I can't figure out why, when everything checks out (i.e. user has selected a 'tempo' and at least one 'move') the form just gets submitted without ever executing any code in the block marked above. Ideally, I'd like to not submit the form at all.

Each issue is just a short article about some aspect of programming in JavaScript. 

The newsletter is focused more on the language than the latest libraries, frameworks, or cool tech demos. It is aimed at intermediate JS developers, or beginners at JS who already know another language.

Some of you might be wondering why I didn't just start a blog. I've found that there is something terribly compelling about having something just show up in your inbox without having to go looking for it. And I'm hoping that this will end up helping developers who want to improve their skills but don't have a lot of time on their hands.

If you have any feedback or suggestions, I'd love to hear them.

However, since I'd like to run the different data sets through the same javascript process, it would help me to have a general filter function instead of having to write a specific one for each data set.

Right now I'm doing something like the following, but there must be a standard way of doing this that I don't know about right?

    filterParams = function(arr, params) {
        var new_array = arr.filter(function(item) {
            var select = 1
            for(obj in params) { //create the filter criteria based on varying set of parameters
                var select = select &amp;&amp; params[obj] === item[obj];
            }
            return select;
        });
        return new_array;
    }

This way I can call

    filterParams(arr, {fname: ""gary"", lname: ""smith""})

or I can call

    filterParams(arr, {city: ""seattle""})

and either way the function will properly sort the data that's being passed.

I will list down what I think the DOM is and my questions will be inline


1.The DOM is a fully object-oriented representation of the web page.The W3C DOM standard forms the basis of the DOM implemented in most modern browsers.

*So does the DOM talk about how an XML/HTML document is represented as an object model ?*

2.The DOM does not specify that documents must be implemented as a tree or a grove, nor does it specify how the relationships among objects be implemented. 

*In what other ways can the document be represented ?*

3.When you do something like this -

document.write('welcome to my home page!');

The document object is provided by the DOM.The write methods are the interfaces that are exposed to JavaScript by the DOM.

*So the objects and it's methods are created as JavaScript objects by the DOM parser and then presented to the JavaScript engine? Or the objects and methods are within the DOM parsing engine in their own native language ? and is exposed to the JavaScript engine ? if this is so then what is responsible for translating from JavaScript to the native language*


4.What are language bindings ?

The language binding is the set of objects native to the language in question that implements each of the interfaces in the DOM specification.

Developers can create language bindings from the DOM to their language simply by following the IDL (Interface Definition Language) in the DOM specification. 

*So if the DOM parsing engine is implemented in say C++, does that mean that when you create language bindings by following the IDL, you are just creating objects in the specific language, i.e C++ that your DOM parsing engine is built with ?*",,False,self,t5_2tugi,1370268249.0,,,True,t3_1fkgzi,http://www.reddit.com/r/learnjavascript/comments/1fkgzi/few_clarifications_needed_about_the_dom/,

dwr/engine.js and jquery-1.8.3.js both use ""$"" to start functions and dwr overwrites jquery.

I solved the problem by using the $.noConflict() method of jquery.
I change my script below to:

    &lt;script&gt;
        (function($) {
             var tags = availableTags;
                  $( ""#user-input"" ).autocomplete({ minLength: 5 },{
                          source: function( request, response ) {
                                   var matcher = new RegExp( $.ui.autocomplete.escapeRegex( request.term ), ""i"" );
                                   response($.grep( tags, function( item ){
                                         return matcher.test( item );
                                   }) );
                          }

           })(jQuery);

     &lt;/script&gt;
**/Edit**

Hello! Someone in learnprogramming told me that you might be able to help me out:

I am working on a Chatbot running on an Apache Tomcat Server.

My task is to implement an Autocomplete function for the user-input.

My script works just fine when I use it on a plain html site with just a textbox on it, but when I try to include it into the .jpsx file of the Chatbot it does not work.

This is the script I use:

    &lt;input id=""autocomplete""/&gt;
    &lt;script&gt;
    var tags = availableTags;
    $(""#autocomplete"").autocomplete({
        source: function (request, response) {
            var matcher = new RegExp(""^"" +
    $.ui.autocomplete.escapeRegex(request.term), ""i"");
            response($.grep(tags, function (item) {
                return matcher.test(item);
            }));
        }
    });
    &lt;/script&gt; 

The Bot uses the DWR Library. When I remove

    &lt;script type=""text/javascript"" src=""dwr/util.js""&gt;&lt;!--  --&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

from the html head, the Chatbot functionallity doesn't work anymore, but my autocomplete does.

Someone had a similar problem [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1519165/jquery-autocomplete-with-dwr#) , but I don't understand the given solution, in particular what ""data"" means in the example.

I have been sitting here now for 5 hours and tried like a million different approaches and don't know what to do next.

I'd be really glad if somebody could help me, thanks!

I'm a bit short on time so I'm going to copy-paste my original question here   

For my programming 101 course we had the assignement of making an RSS webpage with multiple feeds(static/pre-determined) that could be switched through using jQuery, which was the API we were supposed to toy around with. I was able to make such a page, but the method I used seems a bit...inelegant.    

Basically I made ten feeds using a feed generator on generateit.net so they would keep up to date, load every one of them into the page at first, .hide() all of them, and then use buttons to toggle their visibility.([link to the page in question](http://flauntfive.net) , I'm having trouble punching it in in JSfiddle so I made a [somewhat-working](http://jsfiddle.net/BCmSJ/) one so you could see the basic JavaScript code)   

I'm pretty sure there should be a way to just load the scripts in with a button press without having to put them into the HTML page beforehand (or in the &lt;head&gt; maybe?).
I've tried it with the .html(), .load() and .getscript() methods but haven't had any working result yet. Is there something I'm missing? I'm a rookie so don't hesitate to point out the easy mistakes.

I'm new to JavaScript, and before I came across this book I had been writing mostly procedural JS.  I do have experience with OO programming in PHP and Java, but I'm hung up on a few things in JS.  I really liked the idea of the 'revealing module' pattern because it's so class-like, so I attempted to refactor some of my code utilizing this design pattern.  The issue I ran into was this:

I separated my code based on functionality where I previously had a litany of functions.  So it turned out I had four major groups -- something like, action, validate, format, display.  I turned each of these collections of functions with distinct functionality into modules.

For example:

    var validate = function () {
  
      function dateTime () {
        //validate and return date  
      }

      function variable () {
        //validate and return variable
      }
  
      return {
        dateTime : dateTime,
        variable : variable
      };
    }();

etc.

The issue is that the order in which I instantiate these objects matters because they're variables, not functions, not classes (of course).  It's not like any JS interpreter will look ahead and prep the objects I'm working with.  I want to use these modules together but I can't because of this issue.  Am I using this design pattern the wrong way?  Should I be thinking about this differently?",,False,self,t5_2tugi,False,,,True,t3_1kp75x,http://www.reddit.com/r/learnjavascript/comments/1kp75x/how_to_use_the_module_pattern_in_js/,

So I'm having trouble with a concept here, and haven't had any luck on google. Basically what I need to do is have a popup open (which I can do) and have my manipulations in the popup modify the parent window. What I have to do in my code is too complicated to explain so I just want to learn by example. Say my parent window is this shown in JS Fiddle: [Parent window](http://jsfiddle.net/t3pvA/)

So now say in my popup window I want to be able to input a value and have that be var x in my parent window, aka the map zoom. So if I input 2 into my popup window, the map instantly updates the zoom to 2. 

I found [this example online](http://www.tonybhimani.com/2011/10/16/javascript-controlling-a-popup-windows-parent-window/), but the functions being used aren't quite the same as what I'm looking for, so I am confused.

The sequence of triangle numbers is generated by adding the natural numbers. So the 7th triangle number would be 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28. The first ten terms would be:

1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...

Let us list the factors of the first seven triangle numbers:

 1: 1

 3: 1,3

 6: 1,2,3,6

10: 1,2,5,10

15: 1,3,5,15

21: 1,3,7,21

28: 1,2,4,7,14,28

We can see that 28 is the first triangle number to have over five divisors.

What is the value of the first triangle number to have over five hundred divisors?

I'm working on a project for work and am running into issues figuring out how best to handle a clients request.

Here's what I'm looking at:
http://puu.sh/40eZL.png

Given the above picture, it's fairly obvious what I'm trying to accomplish. The users will click the left/right arrows to cycle through the various food options that they have to choose from.

Issues I'm running into, and why no jQuery plugins seem to be able to accomplish what I need:

- The images need to be smaller to the left / right, and slowly increase in size towards the middle
- The images need to ""slide"" left/right, increasing+decreasing in size as they become more centered
- The center image (whichever food happens to be slid to the middle position) actually has a different image src than the rest; whichever one is in the middle has an ""active"" image which gives it a white outline as you can see by the picture.

So I need to make this selection slider from scratch and don't even know where to begin given the constraints listed above.

**NOTE:** I've looked at a dozen 'jQuery slider' plugins - even ones with the mac-like ""dock"" effect (elements not in the middle are smaller) - but none allow me to do position the elements like they are in the above picture (in an every-so-slight curve downwards towards the middle). 

Also none of them allow me to ""detect which image is the middle image"" so I can't change its src attribute to the active version of the food image.

Stuck and hoping some JavaScript ninja out there would be willing to help me / point me in the right direction,

Cheers

I'm curious how people structure this. If you're building the back end on CodeIgniter, for example, would you still use a CI view to return the markup that the use sees, or would you keep that service entirely isolated in its own directory (e.g. if your application is located at /MyWebApp/index.html, your CI setup would be somewhere like /MyWebApp/data)?

Also, slightly unrelated (and probably highly subjective), but what frameworks do people like for generating page elements based on data from a RESTful service? For example, if I want to show a login field in the header only if the user's not already logged in, and show some buttons otherwise, could I set that up as a view in Angular, or would that be overkill?

I posted this to r/Javascript, and they suggested I post here. I am very new to JS, so please bear with me.

I have a JS Calculator on a site I am doing for a client. The claculator script was taken from [this](http://www.javascript-coder.com/javascript-form/javascript-calculator-script.phtml) tutorial, and I have modified it (Probably very badly) to do a few other things as well.


The script uses an array of pre-determined values, depending on which radio button a user has checked, to work out the 'savings' that my client's product yields. My question is: How can I include an input where a user enters a 'custom' price? How do I take the value from the textbox/input, and add that to the array so that it is used in the equation?

[Here](http://clients.brey.co.za/jsproblem/azisa-calculator.html) is the page with the calculator, and [here](http://clients.brey.co.za/jsproblem/js/main.js) is my JS file.

The equation is as follows. (The price of the product + 22% IF a user checks the 'Azisa Price' option OR + 0 if the user checks the 'Cash Price' Option) Divided by 12 and then +35 as a handling fee. The 'custom price' needs to be included in the function that adds 22%, IF a user has checked the 'Azisa Price' option.


Any help would be greatly appreciated, thank you for your time.

The structure and scale means I can't provide a JSFiddle so if you want to try it out you need to grab the source and open index.html.

Its not complete, but the foundation is in, mostly. It is bigger than the previous game with a lot of changes. The biggest change is that the game is no longer turn based, it uses an Active Time Battle system similar to FF IV. The aesthetics have been changed to look a bit nicer, and my use of canvas is slightly heaver than last time. The ATB system also called for use of a simple game loop. It runs at about 30 FPS, this is intentional.

    for (var key in obj) {
      console.log(key);
    }

but it only returned `undefined`.  Am I understanding this correctly?

I'm a fairly young and inexperienced script-kiddie who got started with Javascript a while ago. A few weeks back, I decided to try my hand at making a tiny chrome plugin, and so I did.

The plugin, [GameBanana Enhancer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gamebanana-enhancer/cnbgkpfgibfgmniadmbmelngcjfjdcje), is one I created to allow users to customize their experience on a semi-minor game customization website, [gamebanana.com](http://gamebanana.com). Everything has gone fine and dandy until I decided to try my hand at custom-builting drag-and-drop functionality into the settings page.

Source of opt.js can be found [here](http://pastebin.com/iSJ0s5MF).

Drag-and-drop works fine, but you'll often find that after saving, a significant part of the column you dragged through has been deleted. I save my columns in a 2-dimensional-array, with each column being their own entry consisting of further entries of JSON objects each being their own module

    [{ ""module"" : { ""name"":""feature"", ""locked"":true } }, { ""module"" : { ""name"":""sprays"" } }]

I do this so that I can later add in other types than modules if needed, as well as have multiple properties pr. module (such as name, locked, etc.). I believe my problem lies in the doDrag() function, specifically the splicing:

    // --- Move 'em around ---
    // If it's not hovering over itself
    if (!(targetCol == elmCol &amp;&amp; targetNum == elmNum)) {
    	document.querySelectorAll(""#columnGrid .column"")[targetCol].insertBefore(dragElm, document.querySelectorAll(""#columnGrid .column"")[targetCol].children[targetNum]);
    	columnSetup[targetCol].splice(targetNum,0,columnSetup[elmCol][elmNum]);
    	columnSetup[elmCol].splice(elmNum,1)

 - Finished one HTML5 game tutorial on [youtube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n7ZjhwXF8o). I thought i understood everything, but when i started to get something done by myself i got lost horribly. I know i cant learn everything overnight :)




So right now i am trying to learn js by creating my own game, by searching how to do various parts and learning in the meantime. 




Is there anyone who could guide me to good tutorials, guides or whatever for what i need to learn before i can create a HTML5 game?

Click that same area again (clicking the second image), and you'll get Pikachu back. This part works fine (the top half of my javascript). The trouble is trying to figure out how to set a cookie. All I want is for the state of the first image's visibility to be remembered whenever a user refreshes the page or goes to another page.

The whole point to this is because I do know there are people who don't like floating images, let alone floating gifs. However, I also know there are people who will find it charming. I want to satisfy both people. But I just can't get this cookie stuff to work.

The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^^2 = 385
The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,

(1 + 2 + ... + 10)2 = 55^2 = 3025
Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025  385 = 2640.

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.

My solution:

    var sum_squared=0;
    var squared_sums=0;

    function sum_square_difference(num){
    	for (i=1;i&lt;=num;i++){
    		sum_squared += i;

I know a fair amount of Python, PHP, HTML, CSS and I am going to start learning JavaScript...but then I was thinking: ""hmm maybe I should just learn Dart, it's new and shiny, it's backed by Google, and is meant (operative word is meant, not will) to replace Javascript.
Of course there are a lot of cons to learning Dart.
1 - We all know Google has a some what flighty reputation when it comes to knew products or initiatives. They drop 'em like nobody's business.
2 - Dart is young, not well-tested, JavaScript is mature, well-documented and there are a ton of frameworks for it.
3 - Learning JavaScript will make learning Dart easy, so just learn JavaScript in case Dart ""shits the bed"".
4 - Dart compiles to JavaScript with dart2js .

Basically, I want a script to be an automatic-voter on imgur. Occasionally I see a user or post get plagued by scripted downvoters or mass fury and want to try and counteract that.

The script(s) needs to do two things:

1. Send a keypress of [

2. Click each instance of `&lt;div title=""like"" class=""arrow up "" type=""caption""/&gt;` or `&lt;div title=""dislike"" class=""arrow down "" type=""caption""/&gt;` on the page (two separate scripts, one to vote up, one down)

3. OPTIONAL: Send a keypress of the right arrow key, and repeat the process.

I would, of course, be extremely grateful to receive a fully-assembled script, but I'm also willing to try and assemble it myself from separate pieces if you provide them. If I'm feeling particularly competent, I'll show my gratitude by changing the HTML targets to reddit's upvote arrows and loosing the script on your profile pages.

**One thing I learned:**

When adding animations, it took me a bit to make sure that everything turned out right. During the animation, the user still can click on the button which initially caused premature selection, skipping a question. What I did to remedy this was to create a conditional statement that exited the click handler if my quiz div was being animated. I did this by putting the following at the top of the click handler:

    if($('#quiz').is(':animated')) {
        return false;

I've almost finished the HTML/CSS course at www.codecademy.com and I've definitely learnt from it, but my goal was to be able to start creating websites which looked a bit better than just

body {background-color:green;
font-type: Verdana;} etc etc

Because I don't really know what to do with my new-found skills, or how I should use them, I've kind of been put off learning anything else and packing it in. Is javascript that much different that it will help me create reach my goal of a website which isn't straight out the '90s?


 PS. If I've forgotten to mention anything, I'm sure someone will politely mention it in the comments.

Currently a student in IT/network security (pretty general stuff), and I stumbled upon this [net-force.nl site](http://www.net-force.nl/challenges/) to learn a bit more about exploits. Their register page seems closed so I can't really take a look at their forum for more informations.


I'm looking for some help here from those who already did those challenges or have a much better understanding than me (not hard).


I'm hitting a wall particularly on challenges 108/109 (Javascript) and 205/206 (Java Applets):




- 108: 

I can't seem to understand how to decode all those 'I' and 'L', even after reading [this link](http://comusic6.tripod.com/108Crack.html). Can someone enlighten me ?




- 109:
 
It seems like the password that we enter is computed, hashed, then compared to the given hash ""B5A2DC0F6DB6C5C12F61ABA44B3A5FBE"".
I tried running a bruteforce but it's taking too long, is there something else that I missed ?




- 205:

Ok, from the source code there is a Applet5.class that I download.
When decompiled, we can see several other classes like PasswordEncrypt.class and AccessDescriptor.class that I also download.

In AccessDescriptor.class, we can already get the username ""Administrator""

    private String[] users = { ""Administrator"" };

The line we are looking at in particular to get the password is:

     this.encrypt = new PasswordEncrypt();

then from the constructor of PasswordEncrypt there is :

    URL localURL = new URL(""http://www.net-force.nl/challenge/level205/password.obj"");

This file is most likely a serialized object (AccessDescriptor).
So i'm trying to unserialize it and get the password with the ""getPassword"" method, but it's returning random values everytime.
Am I on the right way or the opposite?




- 206:

I'm having a hard time understanding the decompiled code. It looks a bit like the 205 but with a bit more complexity (Permissions, etc).


Any help is appreciated ! (also, I hope i'm on the right subreddit)",,False,self,t5_2tugi,1366491742.0,,,True,t3_1crfva,http://www.reddit.com/r/learnjavascript/comments/1crfva/netforcenl_challenges_help_needed/,
