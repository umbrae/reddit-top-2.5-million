Hi there. I am the idea guy/coder/amateur designer behind The Athenaeum, a hobby project that functions like an ""IMDB of art history,"" linking artists to artworks to museums, etc with user-created content.

The Athenaeum is [here](http://www.the-athenaeum.org)

We're growing and making progress on the feature set, and I would like thoughts on what to add/fix/change to make this a useful tool. I put this up on r/art, and it was suggested to cross-post here.

If so inclined, take a look and share your thoughts! All critiques welcome no matter how harsh. ;-)

(coming in with a BA after a gap year working full time at a museum. I'll get my Masters as part of the PhD program, so it's fully funded.), My interests are curatorial, but not exclusively so. I'm interested in hearing experiences from those who are currently in a graduate program, or those who have completed/left an advanced degree. 

What were the positives and negatives of the experience? How was adjusting to the workload? What did you wish you had prepared for/read beforehand? I'll read whatever you've got.  

(I've also heard plenty of doom and gloom about employment prospects, and hearing more of it is pointless. I'm fully aware it's difficult to get a job, but the school I'm headed to will give me as good a chance of employment as any other program.) 

So yea, any advice? I've heard quite a lot from advisers, professors and curators, but not as much from current graduate students.

Thus, I have been introduced to the constant historical objectification of women. Alas, studying the various eras pre-1970s, feminism was never a part of the lecture. We exist in a patriarchal society, a society whose gender inequalities are more extreme the more you go back in time. So, we looked at reclining nudes, nude muses, nude goddesses and so forth. And, when presented with the nude female body — painted by males — over and over again, no one snickered. No one made lewd comments under their breath. We studied, and respected, the art for art's sake.

Today our professor lectured on first wave feminist art, specifically Carolee Shneemann's *Scroll* performance. Not only was there constant giggling, but someone had the gall to say ""I wonder if it smells like fish"" and in a nearly inaudible voice, ask the female professor if she had ever participated in a performance like that. These, among other rude and offensive comments, have made me question how far society has come. 

If you don't like it, or don't agree with it, fine. You don't have to like everything you learn. But you're a college student.

Cool, right? It is titled: A woman disguised as a man holding a parrot.

 And the info at the bottom read: It is likely that this sculpture depicts a woman dressed as a foreign man, a common practice during the Tang dynasty. 

It kind of just left out the whole point really. Why would women in the Tang Dynasty dress as foreign men? I've been all around google but can't really locate anything that's worth something. And why is she holding a parrot? I guess I am basically asking for the iconography of this piece.

The consensus is that they were disregarded historically, and then at some stage during the 20th century they were rediscovered, and accepted into the canon of Art History.
I'm interested in the way that this came about, and presume it has something to do with early feminist art history, but no one seems to address it directly. Does anyone know who it was that popularised any of these artists (or other women artists that have had similar treatment), or if there was a specific impetus for people to do so?

In planning my education I've always gone with trying to do something that gets you well paying jobs. But I'm kinda having some doubts.

I really like the connection between social circumstance (i.e. history) and the art that's produced in a given time or location. I'm fascinated by the philosophical and political outlooks that cause waves and fluctuations in subjects and style. I do not, however, have the slightest artistic ability.

So I'm sort of wondering what job opportunities education in this field or related fields offer and also whether the paragraph above sounds like I'd have a good time with the subject.

1330895875.0,12,self.ArtHistory,qhlb0,Seeking clarification on Cubism,12,0,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/ArtHistory/comments/qhlb0/seeking_clarification_on_cubism/,"I recently decided to read up on Cubism so I hit up my college library and picked out the first book on the subject that I liked the look of, which happened to be *The Cubist Epoch* by Douglas Cooper. I started the book seeking two answers: what influenced the movement to begin with, and what defines Cubism generally.
The first question I feel has been answered well enough and I am content with the answers I have, though even on my second read I'm having trouble forming in my mind a concise and understandable definition of Cubism. There are fragments of answers here and there, though for me the book seems riddled with seeming contradictions and vague terms so I'd greatly appreciate it if someone here could clarify for me!

One area I find trouble is that of the 'faceting' technique Cubism uses, as there is a quote from Braque that states he aimed to *'portray every physical aspect of a woman, just as a house must be drawn in plan, elevation and section'* in order to '*expose the absolute, and not merely the factitious woman'*, which suggests him painting not what he sees literally in the one scene, but what he knows about the scene and how it interacts with the space, how it appears from all angles, the quality that each viewpoint expresses, etc. He follows this up with a quote later on, describing Braque's works at l'Estaque, the author states *'as opposed to allowing the landscape to impose itself upon him as an organised set of forms, he imposed his own sense of reality on the landscape'* However, the author previously states that the problems with Impressionism, and what the Cubists rebelled against was the fact the Impressionists were '*more concerned with expressing an idea than trying to present the world around them*'  and had *'lost sight of the solider aspects of reality'*. Is there not some contradiction in his argument here? Surely isn't him imposing his own sense of reality upon a scene not the same as what the Impressionists were doing? 

In addition, I find it difficult to grasp these 'solider aspects of reality' the Cubists were arguably striving towards, especially when considering the works of Picasso and Braque around 1910-11. In the section discussing this period, Cooper argues their basic intention was *'to recreate visual reality as completely as possible in a self sufficing, non-imitative art form*', however, I find this supposed movement towards reality hard to grasp when their work is progressing from pieces such [Les Demoiselles](http://smarthistory.khanacademy.org/assets/images/images/avignon.jpg) to [Harbour in Normandy](http://www.friendsofart.net/static/images/art3/georges-braque-harbour-in-normandy.jpg) to [Still Life with a Clarinet](http://uploads6.wikipaintings.org/images/pablo-picasso/clarinet-1911.jpg), ie. becoming more abstract. 

Sorry if this is incoherent, but I guess my overall question is what is the Cubist relation to depicting reality? Is it looking at reality in an unsophisticated way and appreciating the underlying forms and relations of space in a scene, or somehow painting it just as you see it? And is Cubism concerned with depicting visual reality, and if so how do we account for the increasingly abstract works produced by Braque and Picasso from 1909-10 onwards?

[A wooden Bison that belonged to my Great Grandfather (he was born in the Western United States in the 1890's) We have no idea where he got it](http://imgur.com/a/szifr)

Edit: The Bison is an interesting piece only because it belonged to my Great Grandfather.  Since he was born in the American West in the 1890's (he had children very late in life) I felt it was a good idea to post it.  He also worked for some kind of commission during the Great Depression.  I am not exactly sure what it was; I know he was payed by the government to travel to the Native American tribes and interview them.  I know that some of these tribes were dying out and are no longer in existence.  The idea was to preserve the history before it vanished.  Its VERY heavy, made of some kind of dense hardwood.  A lot of work went into this buffalo/bison.  I can tell because its hand carved (I've worked with wood since I was a freshman in high school).  I posted this because we don't know where he got it.  He could have gotten it during his childhood in the last remnants of the 'Wild West' or he could have gotten it while traveling to Native American communities in the 1930's.  He could have also gotten it during World War 1 (he was an American, but could not wait for the American's to get into the war so he joined the Canadian army instead.)  The man was well traveled.  Either way, its rather old, well crafted, and according to my Mother and Aunt, he always kept it close at hand.

There is so much more...but this should do it for now.  ANY help or information would be awesome! 

Edit: All 3 grandchildren are in college, so if they are worth something Great!  Mostly we want to know about the history, how to care for them... just get more information (more information is always good).

Hello, fellow art history nerds! In case you haven't noticed, our humble subreddit recently passed the 2,000 subscriber mark. It's a great moment for /r/ArtHistory, but unfortunately not one I can take credit for. Of course, reddit is growing at the same pace, and now there is a veritable cornucopia of art subreddits for the discerning redditor.

When I first arrived at this subreddit, it was closer to an all-purpose art article subreddit. In the past few months, a few other subreddits, like /r/ArtSphere, have sprung up with similar ideals. With that in mind, I think it's time for us to ponder /r/ArtHistory- of what it is now, of what it could be.

Feel free to answer as many of the questions below as you'd like- if you feel I forgot/neglected a topic, please bring it up!

____

What should /r/ArtHistory's goals be?

How satisfied are you with the subreddit? What content would you like to see more/less of here?

Would you like to see a ruleset for the subreddit develop? If so, could you suggest the rules you would like implemented?

Should we try to foster a stronger sense of community? If so, what needs to be done to encourage it?

___

Thanks, everyone! I truly enjoy moderating here, and hope to make /r/ArtHistory better in any way I can.

We went to the Galleria dell'Accademia and of course it was great to see Michelangelo's ""David"" but I think something else stuck with me more: [the ""Slaves""](http://www.walkaboutflorence.com/sites/default/files/styles/original/public/Michelangelo_Slaves_Prisoner_Prigioni_Florence_Italy.jpg) (please correct me if I'm using the wrong name, this was a while ago). These were half-finished; part sculpture, part marble slab so that the figures seemed to be struggling with/emerging from the raw marble. I was amazed by the concept and the insight it provided into both the mind and the technique of the creator.

I mentioned them to someone today who told me he was pretty sure Michelangelo just stopped the sculptures because the project fell through. As far as the concept/thought behind the work goes, this was a little upsetting to me. It looks like my friend was at least partially right but I'd like to think that, even if it wasn't the original intention, Michelangelo must have been able to appreciate these as more than ""unrealized works.""

I'm interested in museum studies but I don't know if I'm socially adept enough to be a decent curator. 

So I'm thinking about getting a PhD in art history and teaching at the postsecondary level. My focus and major area of interest is contemporary Chinese art.

Pros:

I am a prolific and decent writer, and my field will allow me to put forth a lot of work on a subject that still needs a lot of fleshing out by art historians. 

I like art history, okay, I just really like it. 

Cons:

I am about 30,000 in debt for my bachelor's degree in a combination of Stafford and private loans. Part of the reason I wanted to shoot through my Master's is because I expected to get a job as a librarian and start paying it back quickly. (Wow only 30,000, good for me, I hadn't added it up yet)


The key motivation for what I do is a combination of a passion for art history and a desire for my future children to live extremely well and be healthy and shit. Can anyone here with a PhD give me insight on how well starting a family meshes with this kind of career, especially for women? I only have so many fertile years, you know.

I cannot afford to travel to China on my own steam--I would need a job--and I don't feel I could earn a PhD in contemporary Chinese art without at the very least visiting the country. Obviously. So I'm wondering if the degree would actually take even longer since I'd spend ideally a few years in China. 

My advisor offered to get me a job near Shanghai after I graduate--he has good connections. I'm not too sure about it yet though. 

Ugh this is the worst time to have a career crisis. I have to start applying to grad schools soon. 

Also if you know a better subreddit to post this in, please let me know!

EDIT: REALLY? Only thirty thousand for my bachelor's degree?

I was wondering if anyone out there might be able to help me identify this Byzantine Icon.

So far, I have that is is possibly 16th Century, it is a New Testament Trinity, depicting The Father, The Son and The Holy Spirit.

It is 62.5 x 35 cm and 27mm thick, tempura on canvas on board.

This is its provenance: Provenance: The painter, the archaeologist and the collector Halvor Bagge. The Halvor Bagge collection of icons was exhibited: The Danish Museum of Decorative Arts 1913, The Museum of Decorative Arts in Oslo 1914, Kunstgewerbemuseum in Berlin 1914, Ehrich Galleries, 5th Avenue in New York 1915, Röhsska Konstslöjdmuseet in Gothenburg 1915 and The Art Museum of the University of Lund 1918. Halvor Bagge's collection is discussed in Jens Fleischer's ""Rundt om en søjlehelgen"", in ""Meddelelser fra Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek"" (1993), p. 59-71.

I’m currently finishing my undergraduate art history degree in Paris and I’m thinking of doing my master degree in America or Canada (starting Fall 2013). The problem is, it is very difficult to appreciate the quality of each university via their websites only and I don’t know any American who is studying this subject over here. I would say my English level is pretty good (I’ve been attending summer schools in England) and I’ll be passing the TOEFL test next month. My area of study is modern and contemporary art, especially 20th century prints, but I’m not against getting into curatorship or museum studies in general. 

Could you tell me which universities have not only good reputation but also interesting internship programs? Thank you very much! (and please excuse me if there's any grammatical error)

I have a paper due soon, which is comparing two different sculptures and the first question I have to answer is about its medium/technique. Now the problem is that I think I'm getting style confused with technique. For example, I'm writing about how the sculptor positions people to tell the story and its effects, but I'm not sure if that's technique or not.

Let's say I'm doing it on the [Stele of Hammurabi](https://www.google.com/search?q=stele+of+hammurabi&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=og&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wi&amp;authuser=0&amp;ei=c7mrUbW8JcqxrgHm5YCQBw&amp;biw=1205&amp;bih=679&amp;sei=dbmrUfijG9St4AP7j4HYCA#facrc=_&amp;imgrc=cGge8iNS-qu2YM%3A%3B62lU9Em9OInPqM%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.historians.org%252Ftl%252Flessonplans%252Fnc%252Fkinard%252FHammura1.jpg%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.historians.org%252Ftl%252Flessonplans%252Fnc%252Fkinard%252Fhammurabi.htm%3B1060%3B1497) (I'm really not so I'm not cheating). How would you talk about the sculptor's medium/ technique? Do you talk about how the people are designed/what they portray? Do you talk about how they create the relief? I really have no clue. Any help would be most appreciated. Thank you!

Edit: Thank you everyone! I emailed the professor just to make sure I was on the right track (discussing relief and also composition- hierarchy of scale, registers, focal point, and perspective) and she said I was. You all really helped me understand how to discuss the artworks better and how clear I should be with my vocabulary so thank you very much.

Can they be considered artists if they never actually make anything? if so then why is Michelangelo's name attached to david? Should we not look at Hirst as more of a client and instead have his assistants names attached to it? after reading this I couldnt shake these thoughts: 

""It's often been proposed, seriously, that Damien Hirst is a greater artist than Michelangelo because he had the idea for a shark in a tank whereas Michelangelo didn't have the idea for his David.""

That was not the only time Michelangelo's name was used alongisde Hirst's. Here hirst himself says 

""People don’t like contemporary art but all art starts life as contemporary - I can't really see a difference. Michelangelo was definitely getting that, everybody was getting it. I’m sure there were people in caves going, ‘I like your cave but I hate that crap you've got on the wall’

So Hirst himself sees Michelangelo as the artist and not just a workhand.
What are your thoughts on this? Any good historical reasons for this?

I'm not an art specialist so please be forgiving if I make some huge error when referencing something. A friend recently came into possession of this piece and I was curious about its origins. What I (think) I know:
 * It's a version of The Dormition of the Virgin.
 * The writing above the apostles (I presume the men surrounding Mary are the 12 apostles) is Russian (I may be wrong).
 * The earliest versions of this painting appeared in the 10th century and are still being produced today.
 * That's about all I have at the moment but I would greatly appreciate help with identifying roughly when it may have been painted, by whom if at all possible, and any other history of the piece itself. Thanks in advance.

I'm a freshman at Rhode Island School of Design and had some questions about the theme of the course. I was also wondering if you guys could share some stories and ideas from your courses.

Basically it was a lecture series class with a discussion group. Basic midterms finals and papers were assigned and it wasn't a terribly difficult course as long as you were on top of things. 

We did a full summary of art history by focusing on major periods in AH, but it was obvious that many were left out and the lecturers were steering the course in a specific direction. The themes that they focused on were power (especially political and social) that is represented through art and meaning through representation. These seem like basic building blocks for more complex studies, but I definitely got the sense that in the second half of the course, basically from the renaissance on, we focused a lot on issues surrounding patriarchy and the constructed social society where males rule and control. Especially in controlling what is created. These ideas are somewhat new to me and definitely weren't delineated in High School art history. It left me with a sour taste in my mouth understanding this thread that runs through so much of AH. It's kind of like discovering the dirty secret behind something. 

I was wondering if anyone had a similar experience, or had any comments. Is this the way a AH101 course is usually taught? ",,False,,t5_2r7pk,False,,,True,t3_ekwru,http://www.reddit.com/r/ArtHistory/comments/ekwru/history_of_art_and_visual_culture_101_what_i/,

First, here's some background info:

-I am seventeen years old and I have just graduated from high school and am attending a community college to get my AA, then transfer to some school for art history.
-Related to art history studies, I have taken art appreciation I, art in other cultures, humanities I&amp;II (It was really just on western art), and A.P. art history
-I am really only interested in western world art history, mostly from post impressionist era to art before 1945
-I have over six years in fine arts training through both magnet school classes and outside workshops, but have recently discovered that I hate making art a lot, and more love the history and study of it.
-I am very depressed about the idea that the only thing I am interested in/ like is the least lucrative career in the art industry.
-I hate the idea of being a teacher or professor at all.
- I think I would like to study world history in general, but (and this is embarrassing), am absolutely  terrible at regular history THOUGH, I *am* good at art history

Some of the questions that I can think of right now:
1. What degree in art history has the biggest return on investment?
2. What careers pay the most?/ are in the highest demand THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH BEING A TEACHER
3. Are there any law related jobs having to do with art history?
4. Should I minor in something different just in case art doesn't work out and, if so, what subject?
5.What schools' programs (both undergrad and grad) have the most respected art history programs?
6. Geographically, what places are the best to look for jobs related to art history?

 I've posted similar questions before but I don't think I was clear enough the first time, so the answers weren't helpful.

So I'm an undergraduate student who just finished her second year. I'm primarily an Asian Studies major, but shortly after entering college discovered a gigantic passion for art history, and now I'm a double major. :)

I am planning on going to graduate school (maybe taking a year or two to teach English abroad in Korea or Japan after undergrad, though). What are the good schools for an art history graduate program? I've googled around but really it's hard to find anything coherent online (I just word of mouth from individuals more, anyway). What are master's programs generally like? I hadn't been planning on going to grad school until I decided to take up art history, so I'm at a loss for all this. 

I've been looking at Boston University a lot, mainly because they have an Asian Art History program, which is my line of study. 

Also, I'm wondering what sort of career options are out there- ideally I'd like something where I could travel/work abroad, which was my original goal for a career. Ideally I'd love to work for a museum or teach at a college, but I'm pretty sure that requires a doctorate level education, and honestly I don't think I have what it takes for that. :\

**Before I begin I would like to point out that this is a serious post. I do not wish to offend or spark a debate. I'm simply looking for academic answers.**

I am currently writing an essay about the rise and fall of avant-garde modernism in Paris during the 20th Century and of course one of the key elements has to be the German invasion of France in 1940. I want to tie in a particular quote about so-called ""degenerate art"" which goes a little something like this:

*""As for the degenerate artists, I forbid them to force their so-called experiences upon the public. If they do see fields blue, they are deranged, and should go to an asylum. If they only pretend to see them blue, they are criminals, and should go to prison. I will purge the nation of them.""* ~ Adolf Hitler

The problem is I can't seem to find the source anywhere. One website suggests that an abbreviated version of this quote was attributed to Hitler by Dorothy Thompson, N.Y. Post, Jan 3, 1944, which is about as far as the trail leads to...yet this also appears to be something he would typically say in a speech to rile up his audience...

This isn't a field I'm particularly well-versed in, naturally, but this is an important, albeit depressing and grim, part of art history and wondered if any of you could help me out?

After looking around a bit I realized it is an icon (I didn't really know anything about them until today), Russian I think, and I was wondering if anyone here can tell me anything about it.

You can view the images here: http://imgur.com/a/8mQ82 and http://imgur.com/a/N6pH4

It is 14.4 inches tall by 9.75 inches wide, and appears to be painted over plaster and cloth which has been applied to a wood board. On the back of the panel there is a wax seal showing what appears to be St. Basil's Cathedral, with some writing. The golden color that the figure is on appears to be gold leaf but I'm not completely sure.  It appears as if the figure is holding a sword in the left hand but it could be a quill.  At first I thought the wax seal was something like would be found on a piece from a tourist shop but I'm not so sure.

I've searched around and can't find any Russian icon images showing a figure like this, with those particular items (a book, a cross, and a sword(?))

Is it just some kitschy contemporary piece sold in a tourist shop? Is it something else?

Can you tell me anything about this piece based on the images and info? Who is the figure and what time period might this be from?

The video talked heavily about the idea of the definition of art. If a man takes urinals and puts them in an art gallery, is it art? Is it his masterpiece? It was all very interesting, but one piece stuck out the most to me and that's the one I need help identifying. I don't remember much, but this is what I can recall.

* it was made in the 1900s
* it was about the progression of the universe
* This is the key unique characteristic!
the artist modeled the creation process of the piece after the progression of the universe. So first their were insignificant and ""chaotic"" markings, which eventually became shapes, and eventually color, etc.


Unfortunately, this is all I can remember. I don't know the decade, or the medium, arist, or title. I've searched and searched and have come up with zilch. Can you guys help me rediscover this awesome work?

**EDIT**

Thank you guys for your help so far! I'm sorry that I've given you guys such a general timeframe to work with and almost no description of the work itself. This is what I can remember, and hopefully this helps:

* It was completely abstract. The image wasn't based upon the observance of physical objects, such as a moon or night sky. It was the artist's own rendition of the universe ina very unique way. I seem to remember a grey background with a few circles representing cosmic bodies (stars, planets).
How he made the piece was just as important in the video I saw as was the finished product of his efforts. He started from nothing (big bang theory), chaos ensued -- which I think he represented by adding the background, then slowly things started coming into existence and forming -- represented by the addition of circles ranging from small to larger.

* The concept was abstract and the ultimate image seemed pretty minimalist considering that his art was representing the cosmos.

* The only word I can think of to describe the style of how the objects appear is...defined? The images didn't look like something you'd see from Fauvism or Impressionism. There were pretty clear lines and edges.

The picture in question is a wall painting dating at the end of the 18th century (baroque/classicism), found on a vault in a curia.


There are many deities around Zeus (or Jupiter), and the Olymp on this picture, and Zeus seems to be the connection between all the deities depicted (father, brother, or master).


The deity is depicted as follows:
**He is male, depicted in his left profile, as a young man, with wings, almost nude (wearing nothing but a drapery). In his right hand he is holding a mask of an adult man with horns (possibly a devil mask?), and his left hand a mask of an old man on a stick (possibly a head of an old man on a spear).**


The deities we've managed to rule out are Cupidon, Ianos and Mercury, so this is probably someone else.

For months Wyeth worked on nothing but the grass; then, much more quickly, delineated the buildings at the top of the hill. Finally, he came to the figure itself. Her body is turned away from us, so that we get to know her simply through the twist of her torso, the clench of her right fist, the tension of her right arm and the slight disarray of her thick, dark hair. Against the subdued tone of the brown grass, the pink of her dress feels almost explosive. Wyeth recalls that, after sketching the figure,* ""I put this pink tone on her shoulder—and it almost blew me across the room.""

*Finishing the painting brought a sense of fatigue and let-down. When he was done, Wyeth hung it over the sofa in his living room. Visitors hardly glanced at it. In October, when he shipped the painting to a New York City gallery, he told his wife, Betsy,* ""This picture is a complete flat tire.""

Whilst being a little dated, I've found it's sparked something of a renaissance (sorry) in my own interest in pre-Modernist art. While watching the episode *Fallacies of Hope* (I think), I reacquainted myself with some of the artists from 19th Century France, and (re)stumbled upon **Romans of the Decadence** by Thomas Couture. However, it wasn't quite as I remembered from my first exposure to it. The mood seems less ominous  and I seemed to remember when I first studied it, the addition of ""barbarians"" lurking in the shadows behind the pillars, waiting for the right opportunity. I therefore concluded that either I added these own details myself (but I was sure I remembered my lecturer pointing them out), or there is another work of similar theme I can't track down. Can anyone shed any light on this for me? Would be much appreciated.

tl;dr, looking for a (probably) mid-nineteenth century painting with a neoclassical/romantic style, and possible Raphael/Veronese influence in use of space. The subject is orgy and decadence of the late Romans, with barbarians lurking in the shadows. Anyone? Thanks in advance.

This new thread also [cross-posted on r/Art](http://www.reddit.com/r/Art/comments/1dupkg/update_on_the_athenaeum_an_imdb_of_art_history_i/).

**TL/DR**: Over about 10 years, I've built a free art history portal based on user submissions, kind of like an ""IMDB of art history"" - linking artists, artworks, museums, etc together. It's called **The Athenaeum**, and you can check it out [here](http://www.the-athenaeum.org). We just hit 100,000 artworks, I've made some updates since the first post, and I'd like feedback/ideas. If it's ok, I'll do this about every three months or so as I develop the site.


**MODS**: I don't want to do anything out-of-line with repeat posts, so if this is the wrong place or the wrong kind of message, please let me know. But as a long time redditor who built this thing, I hope it's ok. Plus, the discussion last time was really fruitful, and I think it's a natural resource for r/art to be aware of.


**PSA**: Reddit will overload the site for a while, and you'll get database messages like ""Unable to connect to PostgreSQL server: could not fork new process for connection: Resource temporarily unavailable"". It's not a bug, just too much traffic. Usually you can reload a few times and get in the door. I'm working on a server upgrade in the next few months.



**Changes since original post**

* Updated look: People said the site looked dated, so I've changed the background gif and brought in Google fonts across most pages and elements.
* Better search: I was in the middle of a search update last time, and it was buggy. Lots to do yet, but you should find a working (art and artists) search box on most pages now.
* Better logging in/registration: Upgraded the forum and removed captchas, using a different way of trapping spam. Should make registering/logging in easier.
* Showing copyright status: This has been a ton of work, but artists and artworks should ""know"" their copyright status (i.e., estimated copyright status, per US law), and artist and artwork pages have a Copyright tab to explain the reasoning in plain English. Copyright symbols shown in lists of artworks so you don't have to go all the way to the image to find out it's just a thumbnail.
* Random artworks: We now have a random artworks page linked from the home page that loads 12 random artworks at a time.
* Sorting of people is now LASTNAME, Firstname.


**Ideas from original post still being worked on**

* Art movements/schools/styles: I've begun this, but it's not yet functional. Even then, will take some work to get the most common schools tagged.
* Contact page: Need a contact page instead of the footer going straight to e-mail. This is easy, and is probably next.
* ""Mini galleries"" in various places - Maybe on artist listing pages, or on artist bio pages. Need to think about best way to do this from page load/bandwidth perspective, but it's coming.
* Fixing the ""hack"" to get full-res of copyrighted works: Not going to link to it, but was pointed out that you can get high-res versions of copyrighted artworks through manipulating URLs. Fixing it without adding a lot of overhead to image loading will take some finesse.
* Responsive design, i.e., ""Make it work better on my phone"": I don't know when I will get to this; the amount of work to do it right makes my head spin.

**How to help**: Not sure what's ok to say in the post, so if you want to help one way or other (beyond feedback here), PM me or look on the site for ways to do so. 


Ok, so what do you like? What do you hate? What do you wish we did? Be direct - your feedback helps us build a better resource!

I've recently seen some of his work in a lecture and am unable to contact the lecturer. The photo that was shows is of a huge machine-like mobile sculpture. It looked like it's made out of a lot of combined elements including wheels, gears, chains, pipes, ropes, tracks, umbrellas and all sorts of similar objects. I've been told that it moves and uses all the gears, wheels, chains and stuff to create a piece moving, spinning, revolving in unison. The individual elements were colored (red, blue, green, yellow etc.).

I believe it is an artist of the former century. I am sure that he used lithography often as a sketching technique. The pieces are of large scale. 

I am not sure but i think that he used no electricity in his work (I am not sure how the pieces moved exactly).

Here is an image of a work by artist Andrew Smith. It is the closest one i could find to the works of the artist I'm looking for. The ones I'm looking for are bigger, more compact and far more complex.

I'm new here, and I come here crawling on my knees begging for help.

I'm in grad school for an MFA in Animation, and I'm currently enrolled in ""Contemporary Art History (ARTH 701).  It's a required course.

Firstly, I am not a scholar.  I'm not a writer, and I'm not a test taker.  I have trouble reading due to dyslexia.  Go ahead and point out my sweet novelty account. :P

I'll make this short and sweet, and if this doesn't belong here.. downvote me.  **I haven't tried [/r/homeworkhelp](/r/homeworkhelp) - and because I feel this is a bit more loaded of a question which requires some more specific help.**

Essentially the assignment calls for a 10+ page research paper with presentation on an artist and a specific piece of art and an issue.

I'll cut right to the chase though, I've already submitted a thesis and outline to have it shot down saying it's too broad.  I get a chance for a resubmit, and subsequently this also determines the final paper obviously.

My proposal was to look into the secret artworks of Ted Geisel (Dr. Seuss) and analyze a small selection of them and try to determine what movement he belonged to.  The issue which I proposed is that some experts kind of argue over where he stands in art history due to his widely varying style of his ""secret art"" collection (NOT illustration/books!)

I won't elaborate on the conversation I had with her in emails but the summary of it is this quoted text:

*Historiographical research does not mean a survey.  It means you choose one piece and you trace its conception from the reasons, inspiration, etc all the way to perception and critic (with and against opinions on it).  Take your time and will talk face to face.  Read more focused scholarly articles on Seuss and you have enough time to decide.  The revision is due next week (See syllabus).*

So.  Can you guys help me come up with a specific piece of Seuss that was controversial enough to analyze his inspirations, reasons, and how the piece was received?  This 10 page paper includes biography and some background stuff. 

She's reiterated several times that I need to read ""scholarly articles"", so even if you can't help me...  do you know of some research I could use?  Journals?  News articles?

I would *really* appreciate it, everyone.  I wouldn't stumble into a small community and ask a loaded question like this, which is probably way out of bounds compared to what you normally see, but she won't let me change artists.

I have tried everything I can googling him, and all I can turn up is Philip Otter Runge. 

On the back is a small bio : Runge was born near Bad Durrheim ( in the black forest) Germany in 1929. He completed his elementary (art... maybe? has a hole ) education in Stuttgart and then enrolled in the Munich Kunstwerkschule. Under the tutelage of Prof. (destroyed but looks like Beminer) he embraced the style of painting, of the Munich Romantic School. in 1947 Runge exhibited in Munich, in 1949 he presented a one man show in Vienna, and in 1950 exhibited in Bassel Switzerland. The two shows outside germnay brought Runge international recognition. Art critics evaluating the classical landscapes, commented that it was ""equal to the School of the Old Masters"".    

If anyone can find more on him, or help me Look I would much appreciate it.

I have a vague recollection as a kid seeing a stained glass image of Jesus where his right hand was up in the typical blessing pose and his left was down at his side, facing away from us. I remember being told that left hand position meant something along the lines of there being a hidden side to God/Divinity that isn't meant for us to see. It was probably my mom who told me--she had a bachelors in art history and a masters in divinity so she was up on this stuff. Now I wish I'd paid more attention to her.

If it helps any, this image was almost certainly in an Anglican or Episcopal church or cathedral.

It's something that's stayed with me all these years and I got curious about it today and tried looking it up to confirm it. Now I can't even find a picture of Jesus with his left hand at his side, facing back! It's always holding a crook or a lamb or scripture or his heart or whatever.

I thought, being a passionate art historian, I could move forward with a movement that resonates with me and with pure emotion (which then wouldn’t negate the first tattoo – since it would be in-keeping with the ideas that our emotions spur our action in art.) 

The original tattoo is black – so I was thinking of some derivative of a [Malevich painting](http://www.europic-art.com/pic/7/7189.jpg)?

   Greetings fellow medievalists and medieval enthusiasts! I am in need of your help. I need to locate a particular image my wife came across while doing archival research. 


The image is a full page illuminated crucifixion with Mary and John and two hooded monks below the crucified Christ, flanking the skull of Adam. It is a Trecento illumination from central Italy that was cut out of a Missal. It also contains a collectors stamp of ""gr"" enclosed in a circle in the lower left corner. If you have any information of the whereabouts of the image, I would be most grateful. She has looked in different databases, starting with the British Library and has not been so lucky. If you have come across it or believe you have a clue as to its whereabouts please send me a message.

It seems so archaic looking in comparison to other Roman works. It looks like a captive barbarian, probably a victory relief, as he is flanked by Roman military standards. Other than that, I'm lost. The barbarian is unbearded, which is unlike normal barbaric images. The closest things I have found in style are the Arch of Septimus Severus (A provincial Severan work) and certain parts of the Arch of Constantine in Rome. This dates it anywhere from the early 3rd century (~203) to the early 4th century (315). Does anyone have any idea how I could narrow down the date range and try to pin down a location? The style seems so unique I almost want to say it's a fake (but that would be upsetting and easy, so, as such, I'm asking for others' opinions)! Album of images is attached.

So I have an academic predicament here.  I have an incomplete for an Art History course taken last semester and I had all of this semester (which is almost over now) to finish a ten page paper on a topic from Neoclassical or Romantic art history (19th century).  It's not like I haven't been trying, believe me.  I have been studying the paintings and Native American history relentlessly.  

I chose Benjamin West with a focus on his depictions of Native Americans because his inclusion of American Indians in his paintings is often very enigmatic and creates a beautiful effect (see ""The Death of General Wolfe,"" ""Penn's Treaty with the Indians,"" or ""A Portrait of Guy Johnson"").  I was sold as soon as I laid eyes on these paintings.  Circumstances surrounding the creation of the paintings were unusual.  He was really the only person painting Native Americans at the time, and he did so with greater attention to detail regarding dress and other Native customs than any other hacks that dared to approach the subject.  And compared to his other paintings (his catalog is enormous) these few are very different.  A lot of art historians say West invented modern history painting since he was the first to depict a historic event with his subjects in their contemporary dress instead of using Classical, Biblical, or mythological references to make the subject look impressive.

General Wolfe: http://www.sightswithin.com/Benjamin.West/The_Death_of_General_Wolfe/Cropped.jpg
Penn's Treaty: http://withart.visitphilly.com/images/uploads/artwork/WEST_B-1878_1_10.jpg
Guy Johnson: http://www.staroilpainting.com/images/shop/product/b0747a2c1c59f07321ffb3376c2b8dee.jpg

So I chose an oddball topic, which I think is where I ended up in trouble.  It's the independent research area I'm having difficulty with: introduce an independent topic with which to study Benjamin West's paintings and back it up with visual analysis (my professor was very specific).  In what context can I, a lowly undergrad, discuss Benjamin West's paintings of Native Americans with a fresh approach?  I'm at my fucking wit's end here.  I'm so desperate I'm considering comparisons to various saintly or religious figures (lame).  The Indian in ""A Portrait of Guy Johnson"" looks like a St. Francis of Assisi to me, but does that line up?
