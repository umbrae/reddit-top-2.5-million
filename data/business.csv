I can't help but to notice that the only stories that manage to gain even the slightest bit of momentum in this subreddit are the ones that involve something around the lines of ""So and so didn't pay taxes"" or ""Look at what this big bad corporation did.""  

While these stories may be appropriate for different political subreddits, I do not feel these stories are anywhere near appropriate for /r/business.

Too many times I've seen some stretched out, uneducated, politically slanted rantings of some blog posted here about a company that had billions of dollars of revenue and didn't pay a dime of tax. For the love of god, this isn't some astonishing story in the business world. It's how businesses and America's taxation system fucking works.
