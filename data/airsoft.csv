For about 75% of that time I literally thought about death all the time. The peace I would feel from my obsessions made dying seem palatable. 

But then out of nowhere, I rediscovered the hobby after a few years of being dormant. It was as if all the brain power going towards my disorder had been re directed towards something I loved, not something that I hated (the OCD). 

Tinkering with gearboxes, looking for parts and obsessively researching technician skills and different upgrades all provided what I desperately needed...a distraction. I'm not saying that my OCD has gone away but the severity has dropped dramatically, in some part because I found something that I really like. I know this isn't r/OCD and whatnot but I thought it would be cool to share how this hobby has done more for me than just provide a good time.

Anyway, a couple games in I see one of them and I give a short three round burst to his chest. He looks me in the face and turns around and keeps playing. After the game was over I walked up to him and calmly told him to call his hits next time and he responded with a typical ""I can do whatever I want nyah nyah nyah attitude."" I wasn't surprised. So when the next game came around I made it my mission to hunt this little prick. When I found him and shot him again he didn't call his hits again and instead flipped me the bird when I told him to call his hits. So I shot him again on full auto....with a dual sector gear set up...shooting 340 fps....five second long trigger pull. The kid walked off the field and my vengeance was sweet. Then when the game was over and I walked off I saw the kid sitting in the waiting room...crying. Needless to say, the sweet vengeance vanished and the ""Wow I am a douchebag"" feeling set in pretty fast.

An airsoft tech, working on customer's guns out of his dorm room at NYU, was recently arrested and charged with five counts of unlawful possession of a weapon with intent to sell. 
You can tell how incredibly biased the article is by just reading the first sentence. ""Some college kids wait tables, others turn their dorm room into a weapons factory."" I encourage all of you to contact the ""writers"" of this piece and give them some feedback on their article.

Just picked this up yesterday at Home Depot! You can check if they have them near you on their website (I got mine in South Plainfield, NJ). They also have them on amazon. It's way better than most soft-shell gun cases I've seen, and a lot cheaper than a Pelican or LBT case! It's got four locking tabs and three lock options to keep it shut tight.

1365073312.0,141,self.airsoft,1bnjfb,Just got fucked over by skittish liberals,185,44,125,http://www.reddit.com/r/airsoft/comments/1bnjfb/just_got_fucked_over_by_skittish_liberals/,"Ugh, I really don't know what to say.

My buddy and I both run the airsoft club in this liberal arts college, and we have been catching a lot of shit from the administration. But this latest round is making us wonder if it's worth the hassle.

It began before we even started the club or any activity in the first place. I tried to be as proactive as possible and reached out to school administration that we were here, that we had at least 40++ people who signed the club charter and we were going to start club activities. One of the things we asked for was permission to store our equipment at a secure place in campus. They immediately said no, so I rented a spot at $70/month out of my own pocket.

The problems started happening when the first day of activities were about to begin. There was a game that was to begin at 9am, but the storage spot would only open at 10am, so we took our stuff out the night before and arranged to hold a meeting at one of the common areas where we would put our equipment together in one spot (with all guns kept securely and discretely in gun bags, mind) where my buddy and I would conduct a safety check to make sure that other members had the proper equipment and also to ensure that if the cops pulled one of us over, they wouldn't flip the shit. One of the school's private security personnel saw us, confiscated all our stuff and we went through tons of shenanigans. It involved 4 weeks of depriving us of our equipment and the school administration putting the two of us on the judiciary board without giving us notice so that we ""will not show up"" for our trial and pass summary judgment. We were notified of it only after another student working for the school told us about it and we had to threaten legal action for them to back off, and they did. As we were labelling and tagging our stuff for campus security, one of the security personnel told us was that it was okay as long as our stuff stayed in our cars.

And that's what we did. We both became increasingly OCD about making sure that NOBODY had a reason to be freaked out or feel threatened by our activity, and our stuff NEVER left our cars. Then just yesterday, we found a security car blockading his car by parking just adjacent of it. They demanded for him to let them search his car and he refused, because of the shenanigans we previously experienced. They even called in the cops to try to get a search warrant for it. The cop couldn't believe that he was being called to search a car for airsoft guns, but kicked the request upstairs 3 times anyway and got denied all 3 times, so the cop said to my buddy, ""I have no reason to search the car, you're free to go.""

Despite that, security personnel still blockaded his car, and so his buddy was given a ride by his mutual friend around campus to get things sorted out. While doing so, they were being followed by the director of security, where she took down our mutual friend's license number, found his personal cell number and called him up demanding to know what my buddy was up to. Then we got summoned to her office where my buddy gets told that because of his refusal to allow her personnel to search his car, he got ""administratively removed"" from campus with only one hour to pack up and leave, and no, he still could not have his car.

That's the end of the shenanigans. I honestly don't know why the school has been expending so much effort on fucking with us when we have a legal activity going on and neither of us have any problems with conduct, while school security turns a blatant blind eye to rampant drugs &amp; alcohol abuse, widespread vandalism and worse. Should we just give up or hire a lawyer to fight this shit?

**UPDATE**

The aggrieved party decided not to get his lawyer to sue the school because he is pretty close to graduating and because of his rare major, he decided it's not worth ruining his academic career over. I'm sorry - if this happened to me the school would have received my lawyer's letter yesterday.

The outcome is this: our equipment is going to be confiscated indefinitely and the aggrieved party is going to face two judiciary board charges for a) possession of a ""weapon"" that was found in his room after campus security raided it. It is a ""knife"" that is a blunt ornament piece bought from a street market in Israel and b) refusal to obey the orders of a school official. Charge a) should be easy to slap down since the ""knife"" is no more harmful than a letter opener, and b) is up for grabs because we just found out that the rent-a-cops gave inconsistent information (they made the school president panic because somehow they told him that there was ""a student with a firearm who locked himself in his car"").

They also want the aggrieved party to apologize to the director of public safety because he was apparently being mean to her and her feelings were hurt when he refused to let her personnel search his car.",,False,,t5_2qi2x,1365133855.0,,,True,t3_1bnjfb,http://www.reddit.com/r/airsoft/comments/1bnjfb/just_got_fucked_over_by_skittish_liberals/,

We were greeted by a number of young kids who were babbling about playing CoD the day before. We dismiss it and go about getting ready. First game one of the kids holds his hands up, walking out with his hands and weapon raised saying he was hit and when my back is turned attempts to kill me. Yelling ""PSYCH!!!"". His team mate killed me because he can't hit shit.

Following this game we had a manhunt Esq ~ game where the objective was to find the players in the city and kill them. At the end of the game it's discovered that I wasn't found and in turn, thus the game wasn't technically over, but the ref had called the game. Upon hearing this, the same kid as before full auto's me from 4ft away saying ""Got you now!!. This was 20 seconds of the Ref announcing game over.

Well now you're banned and getting assault charges.,157,35,109,http://www.reddit.com/r/airsoft/comments/1fb5f4/story_time_so_you_want_to_be_a_dick_well_now/,"So I'll start by saying that I am a jr. Ref at my local field which I will not name just for the fact that it is going to Court. Anyway I'm 16 but a very respected and aggressive player.

So it begins with us playing a game where you have a certain path to follow and along the path their are key objective buildings that you must capture to move your spawn closer to keep pushing up. Anywho the next building we have to get is fairly large with three windows facing us one window on each side of the door. No ones pushing on our team so I decide to start it and ask for covering fire and run up to the side of the building (their were no guns shooting out of the windows at the time, this is important later)


So the doors on the far right side of the building I'm on the middle left, I go to clear and shoot the guy in the right window with my shotgun. I move on to the left one and see a kid crouched facing the other way. I shoot him and then a person in the corrner that I dident see shoots me in my plate Carrie  with his rifle point blank (20ft engagement for 400fps) alright not too big of a deal, it happens to me a lot because I tend to scare a lot of people do they act on their instinct, I explane that is against the rule to shoot me so close with the rifle. He starts babbling on about how I can shoot people so close but he can't ect.. And how I didn't call my hits when I ran to the building (no one was even shooting when I ran)
I tell him that I'll call the hit as long as he does. 

He says somthing and turns like he's going to walk away, but in a split second he turns points his rifle at my face and sends 5 rd burst point blank directly to my face. Two getting caught by my glasses two getting caught by my shmog, and one hitting my ear causing bleeding. I point him out to the ref and what not. He talks to the owner then I get brought in for him to apologized, an I told him ""I do not accept your apology on the grounds that you could have blinded me, deafened me, taken a tooth out. You assaulted me because YOU did not follow the rules because YOU decide to be an inconsiderate asswhole who could have ruined my entire future as a functioning human and you are oh so lucky I'm not sueing you"" the owner said it was my call weather he gets banned or not at first I told him to not let him back for a while. 

Then his friends who were a table away from us, started being dicks to my friends and I. So I let the owner know that I wish for him and his friends to never be allowed back. And during this time, the dude threatened a marine/army colonel (don't know for sure other than he's a colonel) that he was going to shoot him with a real gun. He didn't say it directly to him, but to his friends and their were many witnesses. So now because of that he his now being reported because of the threat, and I'm now in the process of getting him assault charges. Btw this dudes 21 I'm 16. Things arnt going to be well for him for a while.

1358816132.0,116,self.airsoft,170w1m,Beginner's Guide to MOLLE ,132,16,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/airsoft/comments/170w1m/beginners_guide_to_molle/,"So recently, I've been seeing a bunch of posts about ""is dis vest gud?"" or ""biaying dis kowol vest, wil mai magaziens fit in it????"" Stuff like that. Not to trying to ridicule anyone, since a lot of people have started with these vests, just making a point using facts. What vests are they talking about? [These](http://www.evike.com/product_info.php?products_id=28496). Tactical vests with already-installed pouches. I like to call them pre-made vests. I see a LOT of people wearing them at airsoft games. 


But what's wrong with these vests? Why shouldn't a noob, or any other player, wear one?

Its all about customization and tacticalability (shut up, I would call that a word). I've asked a couple of people with these vests if they really use every single pouch on there. Most of the time, they will say no, or say that they use the pouches for other things. Most of these vests come with a variety of different pouches. The most common is a triple-M4 mag pouch, double-pistol mag pouch, shotgun shell pouch, holster, and a few others. If you want to buy one, ask yourself this.Do you really see yourself using a shotgun, pistol, AND M4? What if you have an AK or other gun that uses larger/different magazines? 

Despite what I just said, the number one problem is customization. In that you can't customize it. What if you want a dump pouch? Nope. Can't add stuff. What if the set-up is uncomfortable, or you are a lefty and can't really get to your magazines without fumbling for them? Can't do anything about that. However, there is hope. MOLLE.



What is MOLLE? Pronounced ""Mol-lee"" or as in the name ""Molly"", MOLLE stands for Modular Lightweight Load-carrying Equipment (taken from the [wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOLLE)). Basically, it is a system of attaching pouches to a vest using tiny horizontal (and occasionally diagonal) [straps](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-EnK3hLK1j9A/TjryP_YKxYI/AAAAAAAAAe8/iZVR_NY83uQ/s1600/molle.jpg). The pouches themselves have long vertical straps, while the vest will have the horizontal straps. [Here](http://www.cheaperthandirt.com/ctd_images/bgprod/MOLLE-434.jpg) is an average MOLLE vest, and [here](http://www.armorytechairsoft.com/7883-thickbox/tmc-molle-cqb-universal-double-mag-pouch-olive-drab.jpg) is what the back of a mag pouch looks like.

**Advantages**

The advantage of MOLLE is that, like I said before, it is good for customization. Why run a bunch of useless pouches when you can have only what you need in any position you want? For instance, I have 3 M4 magazines (that I use), a pistol, two pistol magazines, and a knife. So, as my first MOLLE vest, I bought a simple vest, a triple M4 magazine pouch, a double pistol magazine pouch, dump pouch for empty magazines, a left-leg drop leg panel for the knife, and a right-leg drop-leg holster. Its a rather high-speed loadout, and is fairly light, compared to an average pre-made vest. Worked for me for 4 years.

**Buying your gear**

One of the hardest things is finding gear that you like. You could go with a simple vest, a [plate carrier](http://www.evike.com/product_info.php?products_id=29609) (although I wouldn't recommend it for a first vest), a [chest rig](http://www.evike.com/product_info.php?cPath=30_596&amp;products_id=35997), or a [harness with battle belt](http://www.evike.com/product_info.php?cPath=30_596&amp;products_id=30911). All depends on your preference. Do you want the highest-speed loadout possible, or do you want to be somewhat bulky but able to carry a lot? I prefer a simple vest due to the chest protection, although I will be switching to a plate carrier in a few weeks. You could probably get away with a battle belt, because you have room for a pistol mag pouch, rifle mag pouch, holster, and dump pouch. If you don't want to get hit in the chest, get a chest rig/vest/plate carrier.

Where should you buy your gear from, and what manufacturer should you get it from? The two best places are Evike and AirsoftGI in my opinion. Both ship pretty fast if you live in the US, and the prices are fairly decent and similar to each other. I think ASGI has more of a variety of plate carriers and vests, however. As for manufacturers, Flyye and Pantac are your best options. Although pretty expensive, their tactical gear is superb and very durable. If you can't afford either of them, Condor is a good place to start. Before a bunch of angry airsoft players show up at my door, I want to say that  I've personally never had any problems with Condor other than the buckles on my vest getting busted from being shot too much. To be honest, its really just hit and miss, and treating your gear well. This is also due to the fact that Condor has a LOT of different pouches and gear options. Vests and plate carriers usually retail for about $30-$100, depending on what you get. Pretty sweet deal, if you ask me. Also, make sure to get your gear in the same color. The reason I say this is that when I bought all my gear, I just picked out what I wanted, ignoring what color it was. I ended up with mostly digital ACU, but most of my mag pouches were different colors. Remember to get a color scheme that you think will be best suited to what you play. Don't get woodland-style gear if you play in the desert, and so on. 

**Weaving your MOLLE**

You just got your gear in the mail, and have no idea what to do with it. It might look easy. After all, you just thread the vertical straps on the pouches through the horizontal straps on the vest, right? Wrong. MOLLE weaving is harder than it looks. There IS a technique, and it takes a little while to get used to, and once took my friend 3 hours to get get all of his pouches on. Even some experienced players don't know the [correct](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oA6lpgApF0c) way. I didn't until 3 months ago for goodness sake. This way really helps because your pouches will not slide up and down on your vest, which in turn causes less noise and such.

**Conclusion**

Hope you found this helpful. One of the reasons I made this is so people could just link it to new players on this subreddit asking about something. If I forgot anything, let me know. Enjoy your new gear. Hopefully it will last a long time. And don't buy too many [pouches](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrAIFP2pfew)!

Over time though any paint job will experience wear through normal use and the areas that get the most action (like the grip, stock, foregrip) will be the first ones to get scratched up. I typically triple and quadruple coat those areas with clear coat just to help make it last longer but there is no paint job that will stay on forever.  The great thing about the A-TACS pattern is that it actually tends to look better as some of the busy areas start to get some wear.

Bright plastic shells for minors and more restrictions on how they are sold and transported. I am asking everyone here to please, regardless of where you live, do the following:
 
* **DO NOT PLAY WITH AIRSOFT ANTHING IN PARKS, SCHOOLS, OR OTHER PUBLIC PLACES.** Not only is this a good way to get placed in police custody, you rifle/pistol confiscated, and/or ticketed, there is always the possibility of being shot. For example:

1. http://news.yahoo.com/man-toy-gun-shot-killed-police-fla-073336410.html
2. http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/01/10-year-old-boy-arrested-after-pointing-toy-gun-at-woman.html

* Use a gun bag for transportation, and keep it in the bag until you are home, at the field, or inside the shop. 
* Observe the 4 rules posted about firearms on the sidebar. You come to CA and ignore those on the fields I play, you may get an earful from myself or the other Marine and Army vets that airsoft there.
* Lastly, use common sense. If you have to stop and think if its a good idea then don't do it. If you don't normally stop to do so, please do.

Look, have fun. I mean it. This is a great hobby with wonderful and intelligent people playing it. But do not be the one the local law makers use to ""make an example of"".

My attitude changed when I looked more into it, the matches look fun as long as people remain honest about when they get hit.         

One thing I noticed is a LOT of serious hating on backyard airsoft, so much so that some forums won't even allow DISCUSSION of it. Personally I find such an elitist attitude unproductive. They bitch about cheap ""Walmart guns"", that backyard airsofters use.         
       
The underlying issue here is money. Take the despised ""Walmart guns"" that some have even called to be banned. No one with money is going to go out and buy a cheap ass gun that is likely to jam, break, and definitely put them at a disadvantage against players with $$$ guns. People buy what they can afford. The same goes for where to play. Some people can't afford to drop $25 every time they want to play, not to mention in some locations the airsoft arena/field may be over an hour away, so then even if you have the money transportation becomes an issue.          
       
The leet answer to this is if you can't afford better guns and arena fee's, don't play airsoft. Nice try, FAIL. People with short money who want to play are GOING to play, rather than shitting on them wouldn't it be better to post on the safest possible way to play backyard airsoft? Yard needs to be fenced in or surrounded by some woods, avoid public areas etc?

This generally sucks and wrecks an otherwise fun days shot. Myself and some chums have been thinking about this and have come up with a couple of ways to avoid it from happening so I thought I would share our simple 5 step program:

1 - Remember that your shot may not have hit them. It's tricky to track a 6mm BB travelling at a couple hundred feet per second at 30+ feet, even before you take into account being in a firefight or that a twig can screw its flight path.

2 - Accept that people sometimes honestly don't notice getting hit. Folks wear a lot of kit on the field so they may not have felt the zing or heard the ping. We all do it, so forgive them as you know it could easily be you next time.

3 - Keep on playing fair. If your taking your hits the other team will be far more likely to take their hits. Going rogue and tanking through just fuels the fire, ending up in a messy 'shot to yelled' situation. 

4 - Don't be the guy to yell ""Take your fucking hits"". Suppress the urge, remember 'it's just a game', and carry on playing whilst running through 1, 2 &amp; 3. Maybe let them know during a reset or offer a polite 'dude, got ya' but keep it friendly. If it's getting you steamed take a break for a bit, whatever it takes to avoid throwing epithets around.

5 - Let the ref know about it. You paid to play, not to marshal, so help them do their job. Part of their job is letting players know when they get things wrong, so letting them get on with it isn't a bad thing. Most of the time the guy who got it wrong will go 'shit, my bad' and up their game. If they don't then the ref will throw them out of the game, simple as, and if that doesn't happen then look for a field with better players &amp; better refs.

The above may not work for everyone but we've used it and had a fine  time on the field as a result of it. It's not affected our win/lose ratio but it's made things a lot more fun, so IMO we've won hands down from it.",,False,,t5_2qi2x,False,,,True,t3_1da8ld,http://www.reddit.com/r/airsoft/comments/1da8ld/how_to_avoid_people_yelling_take_your_fucking_hits/,

A fully upgraded ($942) spring sniper, from start to finish.",113,15,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/airsoft/comments/1fe1r2/a_10_year_long_airsoft_dream_finally_realized_a/,"So I started playing airsoft about 12 years ago. not long after I started playing, the Tokyo Marui VSR-10 came out. It was heralded as a good lower price point competitor to the Maruzen APS-2 sniper system and it saw a lot of promise.

I bought a TM VSR-10 pro sniper not long after they came out and set about upgrading it. Being so young (14-15), I didn't really understand the inner workings of the TM VSR-10 system, and there wasn't a lot of information out there on the platform yet since it was so new. I had a local shop do some upgrades for me. 

I had a complete second cylinder kit that shot about 580 FPS with 0.2's, the first in the world DBC 6.01mm vsr-10 430mm tightbore, a scope, a TM scope mount and silencer attachment, a King Arms 200x40mm silencer, and a spare magazine. The rifle worked great but the accuracy with it wasn't as good as I wanted it to be due to the hook to the right from the VSR-10 hopup design on high FPS setups. I also didn't have any local fields where I was able to use it with the upgraded cylinder since the local field limit at the time everywhere was 400 FPS. After attending my first big event where I was able to use the upgraded cylinder on the field and having a poor time due to how the OP was run, I sold the rifle. This was back in late 2005 or 2006. I also quit airsoft at the time, since I didn't enjoy the local games or fields that were available.

Fast forward to September 2010. I got back into airsoft after I picked up a used JG 416 with 2 magazines and a battery for only $140. (it had a tightbore and it was redone internally, still running great.) After getting into the BST scene on airsoft forum, I started getting an itch to get back into airsoft sniping. There were a lot more local fields now I could use a sniper rifle at, and the amount I knew about VSR-10's compared to before was immensely greater. I was looking for a good deal on a sniper rifle, and I finally found what I was looking for.

[Here's what I found finally in August 2012.](http://i.imgur.com/kt5xpje) It looked like crap and it was based on a JG BAR-10, but the internal parts were good quality ones and the price was right. ($235) A local shop had a whole TM VSR-10 in parts in the back I got my hands on that wasn't operable. I dropped all of the parts into the TM body, and now I had all of the upgrade parts in a TM Rifle. The only non TM part was the BAR-10 cylinder.

I started using the rifle and although I had a good time with it, I desired more performance. The path to this was through more upgrades, so I looked to the best VSR-10 upgrade parts maker, PDI.

I put together a list and saved up, and in two separate orders, I got just over $500 of parts from X-Fire, and that was with going with a less expensive cylinder option. (Saved $45)

[Here is the result of all of my time and effort put into the rifle.](http://i.imgur.com/W0CTm3w)

Parts List with cost:

- Toyko Marui VSR-10 Real Shock: $204

- PDI Raven Cylinder Set: $99

- PDI HD Piston with a 90° piston end: $55

- PDI TM VSR 200 spring: $18

- PDI V-Trigger: $148

- PDI Hopup Chamber: $68

- PDI W hold AEG Bucking: $8

- PDI 6.05mm x 430mm VSR-10 Tight Bore Barrel: $80

- PDI Barrel Spacers: $18

- PDI Light Outer Barrel: $71

- PDI G-Spec Silencer Adapter: $18

- PDI Stock Screws: $10

- King Arms 200mm x 40mm Light Weight Silencer: $35

- Leapers 3-12x44 SWAT Illuminated Scope: $110

My total cost out of pocket was less because of savings from getting a few of these used. (The scope, VSR-10 and V Trigger, saved $268. Will save more if I finish selling off the Laylax parts) Still, building this rifle form start to finish and seeing it work how I want is a great feeling. The only other thing I want to do to it is cosmetic. (Laylax bolt handle) Maybe in the future I'll get a Palsonite cylinder set for a second bolt. I will be getting more springs so I can set the FPS where I want it.

As for performance, it can shoot a variety of FPS levels with spring swaps. Currently with the 200 spring it shoots an average FPS of 390 on the dot using 0.29g Maruzen Super Grand Master BB's. With 0.2's I'm getting 430 FPS, so I'm going to boost the power a little more for a local field which plans on setting a bolt action FPS limit of 450. As for accuracy it's really good, though I haven't been able to test it past 150ft yet.

Starting in 1958, construction finished up around 1963. Designed to with stand a Nuke outside of a mile, it become  vulnerable once ICBM became more accurate. This bunker is equipped with the generating capacity of 500 Kilowatts, an EMP shielded data center, and the filtering capabilities to operate on 1% outside air with zero radiation leakage. The bottom level sits approx. 40 ft underground. The two levels combined accommodate a total of 64,000 sq/ft of floor space. It was decommissioned in 1996 and turned over the county. The county operated glider schools and cadets from the bunker until the early 2000's when it was sold to the previous owner. The previous owner almost allowed the bunker to deteriorate past the point of recovery. He lost it in a tax sale where it was sold to the current owner. 


Among other business interests we are opening our doors during the weekends for Airsoft. Soon we will have an online registration site. here you will be able to pre-register and pay for your place in the weekend events. 


However, before we get this under way we need to acquire the deed to the property. Unfortunately the county is holding the deed for no legal reason. The owner has set up a website with a petition and more information about the deed here: savethebunker.com (sign it if you have time, we need this deed)


We plan on having many more CQB events and many regular gaming days. As an Electronics technician I am working on quite a few different ideas for props like bombs, servers, computer terminals... all the top secret stuff you might interact with while in a bunker. And I plan to make it all work and integrate into the gameplay. 


If you'd like to keep up with the bunker itself and when we are planning games, I can give you a link to our facebook page. 


Oh, and if you have any questions... ask me anything!

That link is to an article explaining gear ratios and how to compute them. A while ago I computed the exact gear ratio of a SHS 13:1 gear set to be 13.65:1, which was important to figuring out my motor speed. It also meant that the SHS 13:1 gears were 37% (18.72 (stock ratio) divided by 13.65) faster than normal gears, good for knowing what your RPS would be if you're going for a specific one.


Recently I was thinking of possibly putting 16:1 gears into an AEG of mine to boost my ROF a little. To know what it would be, I checked the gear ratio on a SHS 16:1, and it's actually 17.28:1. I checked a second time, and got the same result. I also checked 16:1 gear sets from Super Shooter and Ares, both also 17.28:1 ratio instead of the advertized 16:1.

Turns out the only 16:1 gear set I've found so far that is indeed 16:1 is one by a company called X-Player, which has only 9 bevel to spur teeth and 30 spur to bevel teeth, giving it a 16.0:1 gear ratio exactly.



TL:DR, 16:1 gear sets from most companies aren't 16:1 at all, and only offer a speed boost of 8%, which IMO isn't worth the time or money of getting and installing a set of them.",,False,,t5_2qi2x,False,,,True,t3_1bjf1r,http://www.reddit.com/r/airsoft/comments/1bjf1r/so_it_turns_out_almost_all_161_gears_are_actually/,

I was an avid Halo 4/BF3 player. At one point in my life, I sincerely enjoyed gaming. I thought it was *me*. 

But since I've been getting more into airsoft, my eyes have been opened. I believe that in every regard, airsoft is better than any video game you can play. Here's my reasoning for that. 

1. In airsoft, **there's very little ""hate""**. Trash talking in video games is just plain foul and unhealthy. I can't tell you how much rage video games instills in people. It's disgusting. 

2. **If you die, it's usually your fault.** No such thing as lag. All there is is you and your gun ... and your team, I guess. Doesn't get any more pure than that. 

3. **Skill in airsoft is based on knowing how to be a soldier**. In video games, you run around with no regards to cover (think CoD and Halo FFA). There's no incentive to live and play intelligently. In airsoft, there is, even in respawn gametypes. Why? **You don't want to get shot, that's why.** It hurts, or to some, it does. 

4. **99% of the time, the better man/team wins**. Dedicated individuals win, not walk-on kids who grab rentals.

It all started when I purchased a g36.  Originally I used digital MARPAT which works very well in the pacific northwest woodlands.  However, I did not like running around with a g36 while wearing Marine camo.  Ever since, I have been collecting Bundeswehr inspired gear.  Although not finished, I am pretty happy with what I have so far, so I wanted to share it with you all.


[This is the album](http://imgur.com/a/75A0R)


Details are in the captions including the approximate costs of everything, but to summarize:


The primary gun I run with was originally a JG g36c (400 fps variation purchased from Evike).  Since then, I have:

* Added a Prometheus tightbore, r-hopped it, barrel stabilization
* Gearbox durability upgrades (AOE correction/sorbo, reshim, regrease)
* New motor, I believe it is a g&amp;p 120, wish I knew about the Lonex's then
* Wired to deans, but just running 7.4 LiPos
* Some minor exterior modifications including sponge painted camo


I do wish I had a better way to store the battery, since I cannot fit it into the handguard. Also since the Bundeswehr do not use PEQ boxes (as far as I know, they use a laser light module), I have resorted to just strapping a battery bag and trying to make it a bit less conspicuous.  All in all, I am very happy with the performance of the gun.


I forgot to include my g&amp;g m14 in the pictures, which I unfortunately do not use too much due to its size and weight.  Very pretty gun though!

I hope you enjoy the pics, as always I am open to comments and suggestions :)

I go by the name PGids/Mgunner, I've been playing for 5 years, sniping the whole time in the wonderful state of Maine. I've been inside a VSR10 and clones more time then I'd like to count, and I have just recently started a new project with a Tanaka M700 AICS. My last rifle was a fully PDI'd BAR10. 

I have noticed a lot of questions in thus subreddit about Sniper rifles and such, sooooo here we go. I'll probably do a part two and three on other important stuff.

Don't start sniping when you first get into airsoft. I made that choice, and had some serious doubts, but over came it and now im too deep into it to afford to get out if I wanted too, but i'd never do that :D

Rule number one: This is expensive. plan to spend a lot, don't cheap out on shit or it'll break and you have to buy the same part again.

If you plan on regularly using a bolt action sniper rifle (BASR), and want to be able to compete with AEG's, plan to drop loads of money into them. Avoid BASRs made by AGM like the plague. They are made out of spec and with proprietary parts and this becomes a wicked pain when you want to upgrade. If you want a Spring rifle, the TM VSR10 or JG BAR10 (the VSRs cheaper clone) are the top two choices for spring M700s. If your looking for an L96, go with a TSD or UTG.  The TM L96 is also on the market, more expensive, but the build quality is much higher and you get correct mag placement. (Thanks Vorpalbunnie!)

As for upgrading procedure: Accuracy, THEN FPS. I see way too many people building 550 BASR and then upgrading the barrel and hopup. Get a nice tightbore, then bucking if wanted/needed, get a new houp chamber. The R and ER hops are also something to consider, as are Long range barrels. After you get a nice tightbore ( I'd recommend some but I'm a diehard PDI fan so I'm biased) and bucking, start working on the ''power train'' of your gun. #1 mistake I see people do is drop in a massive spring and expect their stock cylinder parts and trigger mech parts to hold up to it. Upgrade your sears/trigger mech first, then your piston, spring guide, and finally a spring. Don't plan on this being cheap, expect to shell out at least $300. Look, you already have a high FPS BASR! Well, don't expect too much until you spend a considerable amount of time tuning it.

Tuning your rifle lets you get the best of what you have in it. I've found that the majority of it is trial and error. Change something, doesn't work, try something else until you find what works best. This ranges from amount of teflon tape on areas that need to be air tight to the tightness of screws.

Gas rifles (Tanaka, KJW) are a whole different monster, I'll do another part on those if enough people are interested.

That concludes part one, AMA on anything pertaining to BASR's. I'll have Part two up soon if this goes well.

Here's some of the things I heard:

* The AIM SVD is godlike,and has no issues with CO2 mags
* The KWA M93r's full auto is a ""glitch"" and is actually not supposed to be there.
* Cyma makes shitty M14s. 
* You can't upgrade a Cyma  M14 into a decent DMR platform.

So I'm **finally** getting on the long road to start my own company. I'm traveling abroad after the summer to work and save up my capital for the company I want to start.

My plan is to buy a 3D-printer and a solid PC to use CAD on and develop airsoft parts. In the beginning I'll probably print stuff for others for money just to keep the balance on the +side.

I want my company to design new, revolutionary parts for airsoft. Meaning not cloning some other company and make a cheaper version of it. I only want to create *new* internal stuff like improved hop-up chambers and new gearbox designs that are compatible with older ones.

And *if* I actually get this company of the ground and it's successful, one of the top priorities will be to get the legal right to make and sell airsoft replicas from sci-fi games &amp; movies ^^^^at ^^^^an ^^^^extremely ^^^^high ^^^^price.  
I've already made some early sketches for a ""gearbox"" design Staff from Star Gate.

**TL;DR:** Anywhore. This is what I need from you guys right now!

* I'm looking for someone to design the logo! I have a pretty good idea on how I want it to look but I can't... hmm... express myself with painting. I will pay for it of course.


* Since the Swedish airsoft community is really small, I will have to rely on being able to export my products. To get anything sold I figure I'll have to sponsor some ""famous"" people within the airsoft community with my products. Which people would that be? CrazyNCman? GMR?

* What is something you would want to see in airsoft that isn't there?

**Note:**

I know, ""small guy, big dreams"". But both my parents have founded several successful companies since they were in their twenties and they'll be helping me getting started with the bureaucracy and giving me guidance.

 I've decided to dedicate a year to get this company started. After that I hope to be able to run it while I study Mechanical Engineering.

I start laughing very quietly cause I don't want to give away our position. I say ""dude just go shit.""

I'm waiting for him to be done, but at that exact moment, I hear what I thought was an AEG start crackling, and a second later, two more, then three. bbs are flying everywhere, while my friend is hunched over taking a shit.  Branches break and fall down upon him, it seemed like hours. He looked at me and was about to shed a single, manly tear, but got hit in the ass, which caused him to shit all over his combat pants, and little bit on his boots.

In all *seriousness*, what the hell is the point? I know having a rubber K bar may complete someones loadout, they may even get a chance to use it as a safety kill. I am not opposed to this at all. But wouldn't it be a lot more efficient to just say ""bang""? Or invest in a real, nice knife to complete the loadout? One which they will use a lot more in game or in real life? Because this rubber knife thing has now turned into nerf swords, foam balls, inner barrels used as blow guns, spoons... fucking *spoons*... I would much rather have a gun trained on someone in case the response of my enemy would be to not respect the fact I just threw a stuffed animal at him and decides to bang kill me. Idk... I know I'm on a rant, and I know its all for LULZ, and everyone plays different and I wouldn't want to stifle anyone's creativity/imagination... but airsofters have always distanced themselves from the stereotypes of playing with toys and being cosplayers/larpers. And I don't think nerf swords help that gap grow. 

Upvote, downvote, whatever makes you happy, but this is a discussion so post your opinions. Lets try to downvote rude comments rather than opposing standpoints this time, yeah? 


EDIT: FYI, I am not suggesting you bring a real knife to a CQB field and try to safety kill someone with it. I am saying if you spend $20 on a rubber knife, and you have it primarily for looks, I would suggest getting a real knife. You can usually bring it to outdoor ops, it looks cool, AND you can use it in real world scenarios for the rest of your life. Unless you use your rubber knife a lot, which I respect.

I spent 90% of the time walking up and down hills over and over, then trying to find my team's triage point. The last part was fun, though. Leave your opinions on the game if you want.

Considering his condition, we suggested something closer or an indoor venue, but he insisted it be at our field or nowhere. We need your help in making this the best event possible for him.

He can’t do too much running around so we are sending the call out to try to get as many military vehicles there as possible for him to move around in.

We also need a great group of players for him to play with. So if you have the time please think about coming to VT that weekend to help him have an amazing event.

Here in France, we need your help against Cybergun. Why? They lock the airsoft market. To sum up, they trademarked terms like ""BLOW-BACK"", ""AIRSOFT GUN"", ""SOFTAIR"", ""HOP-UP"", and even names of airsoft companies they don't even import : MARUI, MARUZEN, KSC... 

They simply locked the market. Every airsoft gun bought outside Cybergun is illegal here... And we all know how overpriced these rebranded cheap guns are. So, let's take, for example, the Cyma CM.028. Asia (RSOV) : $90. USA : (Evike) : $110. Poland : (Taiwangun) : €85/$105. France : €110/$136. Cybergun ... €170/$211!

Summer time is here and its all fun and games until someone is puking and passing out from heat exhaustion/dehydration. Here are some things to remember to bring with you when you go out to shoot people.

1. Drink water starting a couple **hours** before. If you're going to be out on the field for 6-8 hours you're going to want to prepare. Drink about 1-2 liters of water and make sure you're nice and hydrated the night before. You will thank yourself later.

2. Bring water/sports drinks with you. If you're drinking sports drinks, make sure you drink it ALONG with your water and not to REPLACE it.

3. That little plastic water bottle you got out of the vending machine isn't going to be enough. Bring at *least* 6 of those, you're better off having more than you need than not enough. 

4. If you want, bring an ice chest. It's always nice to get some cold water after you've been out sweating and running around. But don't drink cold water exclusively, it takes energy for your body to warm the water up so it can be digested. Keep a couple bottles out that are warm so your body can absorb the water faster.

5. Sunscreen, motherfuckers. We don't want you getting skin cancer or some shit like that so protect yourself.

6. Also, chapstick. Who wants to go home to their girlfriends and be kissing them with torn up, dried out nastyass lips? Nobody. Do you and your girlfriend a favor and remain kissable.

7. Have a first-aid kit. This is something you should have no matter what the season is, but now's a good reminder. Airsoft can be somewhat dangerous and you want to be able to take care of things if there's a minor emergency.

8. Eat a good breakfast. A lot of the kids I see passing out and getting sick and whatnot always give the same answer when I ask them if they ate breakfast: ""No."" Eating is important, especially breakfast, so make sure you get something nice and hearty like some part of an animal in you before you go out. Also have something planned for lunch like a PBJ sammich. Bitches love PBJ sammiches. 

9. Check for ticks. Damn things are like little vampires and you'll get Lyme disease if you aren't careful.  [Read up](http://www.tickencounter.org/prevention/how_to_remove_a_tick_video) on how to get the buggers removed.

That's all I can think of for now, but if you have anything else you'd like to add then leave it in the comments. I'll add it to the big list later.

***FEAR NOT***, lazy asses. I'd like to show you the magical world of [Google](https://www.google.com/)! Did you know that simply searching for the product you are looking for can yield some fantastic results?! WOW! It's like it was meant to be used as a *search* engine! Can't find that darn item you were looking for on a particular airsoft distributor website? They've got a search bar as well! Now, I'm no genius, but if I wanted to find something in particular, I would go there first. ""But I still have a question!"" calm your self, young padawan. Before posting you may also want to search for it on reddit itself! Right on top of the sidebar (we'll get into that shortly) there is a ""Search Reddit"" bar. Now, that little bar of technological wizardry is there to *search* for things. Much like Google, but at a smaller, more defined scale. Want to know about a certain website like airsoftmegastore? Search away! What about those darn, confusing brands. Well, little tike, I can guarantee there was a post or two on that as well. So get searching!

If you think it is faster to post on this subreddit than to search for your question first, then I leave you with this [link](http://i.imgur.com/vS06G9y.png)

___________________________________________________________

Second on our agenda is using that odd little section of the subreddit. I know, it's a bit to the right of your screen and not so flashy and colorful, but I can assure you it is there. The sidebar! Would you like to know how to use it!? Of course you don't, so I'll teach you anyway. On that sidebar, there are various amounts of words and sentences. Some are shorter and some are longer. And, you know what, it can help you with your silly questions! There's the [FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/airsoft/wiki/index), a [beginners guide to buying a gun](https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1O0JcqcWZoALiYIdzXpphdoNHH1VFIeMpRHjatU9mBgo), and even links to other subreddits! 

Golly, that must be a fine and dandy place to look at before posting!

We have been making carbon fiber silencers with anodized aluminum end caps, and the first batch is complete! 

 [Here is an album](http://imgur.com/a/ieXpz) showing some completed pictures and some on-gun shots.  

We have a thread on Airsoft Mechanics including weights and prices along with additional info.  You will need to sign in to view it.  [Here is the for sale thread](http://forums.airsoftmechanics.com/index.php?topic=8759.0).

Ill give a brief description if you dont want to sign in to see the post.
They are, in fact, 100% carbon fiber tubing, not carbon fiber wrapped aluminum or anything like that.  The end caps are 6061 Aluminum, turned on a CNC lathe by a professional machine shop - we made several in both CCW and CW 14mm threads.  They were then anodized professionally by a company that Scatterplot and I have worked with in the past.  We have had parts done by them for our day jobs, and they do exceptional work.  They are also available in a polished or matte ""raw"" color.  (they WILL be sealed though, not just bare aluminum).

The CF tubes were sanded smooth and coated with a high strength, 2 part epoxy that was oven-cured.  The epoxy we use is similar to automotive clearcoat, so its very tough/hard, UV resistant, etc.  

The end caps are epoxied in with industrial strength 2-part epoxy recommended by the carbon fiber manufacturer.  

That might be more than you want to know, but we are VERY excited about these!  They *are* for sale, but im going to leave out details to adhere to the forum rules.  If anyone is interested or has any questions, please message me or scatterplot!

Since a lot of people have asked:

Pricing is $65 for the 160mm length, and $75 for the 260mm length + shipping

I know that most of my 40mm launchers these days are very nice, expensive models like the Deep Fire AT4, Apple Airsoft RPG-7, etc, but I started launching things in airsoft using a very simple 2"" PVC pipe launcher which uses 40mm shells to propel your foam round. I used these with the Nerf Vortex Howler footballs with great effect, but frankly, those got too expensive and hard to find. I've modified my original design from a 2"" bore down to a 1.5"" bore to allow the use of much more common 40mm foam rounds, like the M385 or M29 rounds from Milsim Labs. 

Here's a photo tutorial of what you need. This is a short launcher, you can make it a bit longer for more effective range. The double wall design used in the 1.5"" conversion allows you to mount rails, sights, grips, etc on the outer body of the launcher. 

To fire it, you simply push the button on the back of your shell with your finger. I've never encountered a shell I couldn't fire this way, and I've got weak girly fingers. 

What you need for a build like this:
20-30"" long piece of Sch 40 PVC pipe, both in 1.5"" and 2"" inner diameters. These are your inner and outer bodies, so make the 1.5"" one slightly shorter than your planned length. 

Fernco Proflex 3001-215 Rubber coupler, found at plumbing stores. 2""x1.5"" rubber coupler, slips over the 2"" pipe and holds your 40mm shell in the other end. 

40mm gas shell - this is the most expensive part, costing $20-50 for the shell, depending on what you get. 


Cut your pipes to your desired length, keeping the 1.5"" bit slightly shorter than the 2"" pipe. Wrap some tape around the 1.5"" pipe to give it a snug fit inside the 2"" pipe. Shove the 1.5"" pipe into the 2"" pipe. Add a bit of tape or velcro to the base of the 2"" pipe to help the rubber coupler stay nice and snug. Insert shell, and you're ready to go. Accessorize it however you want, with paint, rails, bipods, etc. However you want to run it, this thing will give you a great base to work with. To reload it, you can pull the rubber coupler off and breach load your round/refill your shell. It's modular in that you can pop the inner barrel out and use it for 2"" projectiles, like nerf footballs, etc. 

Performance-wise, this thing will deliver 200-300' arc'd mortar style firing with a foam round, or 150-200' with BBs. It's a great platform to tinker with, and since it's so cheap, you can make a whole bunch of them.

At first I was like ""Oh cool. A beginner kid's finally getting a decent starter gun."" Then I realized he was aiming the gun all over the place while pulling the trigger. Granted the magazine was out and the battery was not in, that still does not excuse such poor trigger discipline. I wanted to say something but I just kept quiet. No sense in starting an argument with a father and son. Then while looking at some gas blowbacks, in my peripheral vision, I see that the barrel of the gun is literally pointed at the side of my head. I instinctively move out of the way and the dad says ""Relax. None of the guns are loaded, stop being so dramatic."" I just looked at the guy. I couldn't believe what this moron was saying. You have that kind of idiotic view towards gun safety and you're buying your twelve year old son an item that could easily blind someone? You've got to be fucking kidding me. I coldly said, ""All guns are always loaded. Anyone applicable to be around a firearm of any kind should know that."" Needles to say he shut up but I was still mad. Seriously dude, you're forty something years old and you're letting your kid scan a weapon around with other people while pulling the trigger? I'm 19 and I've known better since I was 10 and starting shooting with my Red Ryder. It was a clear sign that neither him or his son should be allowed anywhere near any kind of gun, real steel or airsoft. I left the store fuming and quite frankly it's been eating at me all day. Sorry for the rant but I just needed to vent. 

TL;DR some guy told me to chill out when I noticed his son's horrible trigger discipline. Got pissed and laid some BASIC firearms safety on him to shut him up. ",,False,,t5_2qi2x,False,,,True,t3_1gyikg,http://www.reddit.com/r/airsoft/comments/1gyikg/yet_another_rant/,

I co-run an airsoft ""production"" company called [TAG Operations](http://tagairsoft.org/operations/) and we're always trying to throw in new and interesting props in our games ([the UAV for example](http://www.reddit.com/r/airsoft/comments/1cvh0c/airsoft_uav_in_action/)). I looked everywhere for a custom ""milsim"" prop company to buy these things, but wasn't happy with what I found. I'm pretty confident with DIY, so I decided to take it upon myself to make this one.

This is only the first rendition, and I plan to make major improvements (better case/housing is a first). The annoying buzzer at the end can also be substituted with something much more realistic ;) (but still safe and legal). The code can be easily changed to have a custom input defuse code, but currently creates a random one each time the power is turned on. I have a key power switch on the way, so players can't simply turn it off to ""defuse"" it.

If anyone is interested in me making them one, let me know what kind of specs you want and I'll give you a price point.",,False,,t5_2qi2x,False,,,True,t3_1czc56,http://www.reddit.com/r/airsoft/comments/1czc56/airsoft_c4_prop/,

Here are my impression.,69,10,45,http://www.reddit.com/r/airsoft/comments/w92wq/i_played_airsoft_for_the_first_time_today_here/,"It was one of the most fun times I've had in a long time. I went to [SC Village](http://www.giantairsoft.com/) in southern California, and I played every game that day, except for the last one.

It was ridiculous fun.

My very first match consisted of me turning a corner, and getting shot in the finger from 100 feet away. Rather anticlimactic.

My second match, however, was a whole other story. 

It was about 4 vs. 4, Force on Force (team deathmatch), and our team *dominated.* It was me (20) and three well behaved 13-14 year-olds, against the sleeveless Hispanic group of doom.

My team was able to out-strategize the enemy team, leading to an awesome win.

Some highlights:

Me Vs Guy-on-upper-walkway-who-didn't-like-to-call-his-hits: I was firing all over this guy, and he wouldn't call it. 

""Fuck it,"" I say, ""I'll **make** him call it.""

I proceed to zip from one cover to the next, my posse of middle schoolers obeying my deep manly tones and covering me and the objective. I jump in the lower floor of the building, and ""**BANGBANG, SURRENDER!**"" both him and one of his teammates in 1 second. I spin around and aim up the stairs, and I spot another enemy who just looked down the stairs. He surrenders without me having to say anything. Feels good.

Awesome teamwork throughout a larger team to perfectly defend a ""Plant the bomb"" objective.

Not dying in full gear in 97 degree heat.

People calling me ""Cowboy."" I like my hat. :3

Most of you on here are young, as can tell by most of the whut am bestest threads, If not, then listen to this as well

When you are assaulting an area, and you hear someone in an obviously commanding voice start yelling about pushing, moving, or anything of that sort, listen to him.

Its a game, these BBs don't hurt that bad. So hop up out of your trench and bum rush guns ablaze. Its an awesome feeling!

Reason I say this, is when we were playing we had their team pushed to their one last trench. We could have wiped them out had our team pushed, but everyone was too afraid to do it. So I ran, all by my lonesome, and slammed down infront of the trench behind a dirt cover, waiting.

1364148610.0,61,self.airsoft,1ax9e7,Custom built DMR (with home-made outer barrel!) ,70,9,37,http://www.reddit.com/r/airsoft/comments/1ax9e7/custom_built_dmr_with_homemade_outer_barrel/,"You can see a brief album [here](http://imgur.com/a/5L6ho) as well as some pictures of me with it in game play (game play has different optic and no flash hider yet).  
  
Anyways, here is a list of all of the parts:  
Base gun: G&amp;G GR-15 Raider  
**INTERNALS**  
* Stock G&amp;G gears and  steel-toothed piston  
* Modified (blow-back disabled) cylinder  
* ICS M120 spring and metal air nozzle  
* Marui piston head and steel cylinder head  
* G&amp;P 70 degree hard bucking  
* Mad Bull Python V II 590 mm tight bore inner barrel  
* Classic Army High torque motor  
* Deans for battery connectors  
* HS shims and white-lithium gear lubricant  
  
Here is where it gets interesting.  I bought a longer rail, but I couldn't find a proper outer barrel for it.  So, I decided to make one instead. I went to Menards and bought a 1 inch diameter aluminum pipe and some 1 1/4 PVC pipe.  I made couplings for the aluminum inner-outer barrel and then bolted it directly to the screw hole mounts on the rail.  I then made small inner barrel supporter spacers out of acrylic that I cut with a laser cutter and secured them to the inside.  I then made a cap/""flash hider"" for the very end of the barrel with SolidWorks and then used a 3-D printer to fabricate it which I then painted black and then JB welded to the aluminum pipe.  Every thing was cut to length in respect to the MB inner barrel and it all turned out very nicely.  
Total cost for the outer barrel (besides the rail) was **$8.**  

Performance wise, I get very tight grouping of about a head-sized target at about 130-170 feet.  Velocity, on the other hand isn't all that great.  With the longer barrel and hard bucking, I get around 350 fps with .25g bbs.  Could be better, but hey, accuracy is where it's at!   
All in all, I am very please with the way that this turned out.  What do you guys think of it?  

(Bonus points: With all of these modifications, I don't really know what to classify this gun as any longer.  What do you think this gun should be called?  It's no longer a GR-15, its more or less like an SR-25.  Any ideas?  Thanks!)

My question to you folks, particularly non-techs, is would you buy a gearbox that is made to order? The number of choices would be substantial, you would essentially be able to choose each piece of the gearbox separately and would be given the cost for each choice you make.

Choices would include:

* Bearing/Bushings (6,7,8,9mm)
* Gear ratio (13:1, 14:1, 16:1, 18:1, 32:1, 200:100, 300:100) (dual sector [for applicable ratios])
* Piston type (aluminum, poly carb, metal, teeth)(short stroked)(Swiss Cheesed) 
* Piston head (air brake, padded) (ported, non-ported)
* Wiring (front, rear) (silver, standard, silicon)(MOSFET)
* Cylinder (Volume balanced) (one of the standard port locations) 
* Cylinder head (Standard polycarb, double o-ring aluminum)
* Air nozzle (o-ring) (aluminum, polycarb)
* Spring guide (bearings) (Quick Change)
* Tappet plate (sanded to increase contact)
* Spring (M90-M150)

Of course, standard in every box would be AoE correction, shimming, lubing, and compression perfection/testing. It would essentially be a drop in gearbox built to your own specs.

Shoots about 200 fps and can't hit much of anything past 70 feet. But that 80 bucks is what made me fall in love with the sport. That's what matters to me, that I found out it's something I want to do. If the cheapest gun I could have bought was 200, I wouldn't have ever gotten into airsoft. Now since I know what I'm doing I don't mind dropping 300 on a gun if it's worth it, but I also know which ones are worth it, someone who is new to the game will not know these things. I think it's perfectly acceptable for a virgin airsofter to waste 60-100 bucks to realize that it's a great game and worth spending more bucks on good gear.

More of a story than an actual topic, but...

In high school, I was really into paintball. Like REALLY into it. I thought about it day and night, spent all of my free time thinking up tactics on speedball fields, the works.

It wasn't long until I joined a team. But the cost of having a gun equivalent to a P* in airsoft to play tournament paintball and to maintain gear was expensive. So in order to pay for everything and to avoid being one of those whiny teens who's parents buy all their gear, I picked up a job. Worked everyday after school and sometimes weekends to afford all of my gear.

Eventually, I was able to get all of the gear I wanted through hard work... but then came the dreaded Prom time. I asked the girl I wanted to take, she said yes. Then the realization hit me: you ain't got no mo' money, dude.

I wasn't going to ask my parents for money nor was I going to back out of going to prom. So I did what any desperate teen with a whole bunch of shit would do; I sold my gear... all of it.

Being on such a tight timeline I sold 2.5k worth of gear in under 1 week for less than $600. Heartbreak.

Long story short, she never really liked me and was more or less using me for prom. Heartbreak.

I had never felt depression before, but after having lost my entire high school hobby ""experience"" I was in a deep deep sad sulking hole.

After college started, a buddy of mine introduced me to airsoft and I was instantly hooked. It was first love all over again.

It's a fun hobby, but it really and truly does break my heart to see the paintball and airsoft communities hate eachother so much. Both have up's and down's but in the end, we're all just grown men AND WOMEN shooting eachother with toy guns.

Thanks for listening to me vent, I hope everyone has a nice day!

Just was wondering what the biggest douche/a-hole moment you've had in airsoft (as in someone else cheating, etc.). I'll go first. A few days ago, while playing at my local CQB arena, the game had just ended and a kid took his mask off ( At my field, they are very strict about the not taking off the mask rule) and so I jumped on him and put his mask on and I told him ""hey, don't take your mask off, you can still get hit by a bb after the game"" and he said ok. After that, I told the ref that he took his mask off and the ref talked to him about it and he was on his way. Then, some little kid ( no older than 12) starts telling me to not be a ""tattletale"". His stupidity blew my mind. I responded with telling him I was just making sure he doesn't do it again so he doesn't go blind. The kid then decides that he is going to tell the ref that I took my mask off and goes and tells him. I go over there and I calmly tell the ref that he's lying and to ignore him. The kid then stops after one of my friends (who is 6"") towers over him and tells him to stop. The kid shits his pants and stops. TL;DR kid takes his mask off, I put it back on for him, little kid says not to be tattletale, says I took my mask off, tall friend makes kid shit pants",,False,,t5_2qi2x,False,,,True,t3_18r03x,http://www.reddit.com/r/airsoft/comments/18r03x/biggest_ahole_moment_while_playing_airsoft/,

I have been playing airsoft for more then 14 years, (back when we had to import whole pallets of stuff from japan in 4000 dollar increments as a group to get anything decent... and had to have someone speaking japanese on the phone to do it.)  I have been the head of a regional airsoft association, (the Chicago Airsoft Association) for more then 6 years, and the founder of a team that just celebrated it's 10 year anniversary. 

I have military exp, law enforcement exp... and I really want to contribute to this sub reddit and help share my knowledge of airsoft, running teams, running associations, running huge scale games, and new methods of statistics that the CAA has devised that I feel will change the game for the better, and open up airsoft to a whole new level of play that virtually eliminates the usual cheating aspect.  (we use math to pinpoint certain aspects of possible cheating, video, etc)

But after sitting here, and trying to contribute, or even find something useful to contribute... I have to tell you, there is not very much for me to contribute.  There is only so much that you can say about a pic of a new gun besides ""cool""

I have to tell you, this reddit is by far one of the weakest sources of actual information, players, games, and intel from any point on the internet that I have found yet.

The reason this is bothersome, is because I see sparks and moments of genius here... and I know that people could throw actual information and intel here to make the community a better place to be in.   I see real solid people here posting things, but for some reason everyone just wants to post a picture of whatever gun they have or ask about loadout questions.

1362774822.0,53,self.airsoft,19xk19,A whole different world in Eastern Europe: an introduction to the Hungarian airsoft community,66,13,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/airsoft/comments/19xk19/a_whole_different_world_in_eastern_europe_an/,"Having played airsoft in my home country for 3.5 years and frequented /r/airsoft for approximately a year now, I cannot help but notice that there are staggering differences between Hungary and the US in terms of airsoft culture and community. This post is meant to start a conversation in order to determine how great these differences actually are, learn some useful things from you that could be transplanted here and while we're at it, tell you some horror stories. So let's start with...

**Legal status of airsoft weapons**

Nothing special here, the laws are similar to other countries. Airsoft weapons are legal and classified as air guns, brandishing them in public is illegal and gets you a sentence of 2-8 years for firearms law violation. Their operation is restricted to official shooting ranges and private property that is surrounded by a fence.

**Fields and event organization**

From what I understand after having browsed /r/airsoft for a while, there are people in the US who establish and maintain fields with the express purpose of organizing airsoft events for profit. They care about the game and are interested in making it better for those playing on their field.

That is not the case here. Those who organize games are mostly regular players with over-the-average charisma and acquaintances in the right places. What usually happens is that a player knows someone who has suitable property. This can be as simple as a forested plot of land, but abandoned buildings are the most sought after. They either negotiate rent or the owner lets the team play on his property free of charge. The landlord's work is finished here, most of them don't even care about what happens on their property as long as they get their rent and/or no one calls the cops.

Another difference is the quality of the fields. No offense, but from what I've seen in videos, most American CQB fields look very artificial to me. Crates and stuff arranged in a warehouse, rooms made out of plywood to imitate a CQB environment. The reason why that is different here is that Hungary was communist from 1949 to 1989. That means forced industrialization, agricultural collectivization, Soviet occupation and more. Factories were built and kolkhozy (I guess that is the plural of kolkhoz) were created by the hundreds. Soviet occupational forces stayed in their own barracks, separately from our own soldiers.

The system eventually failed, because, let's admit, this country can't support the industry the communists wanted it to and kolkhozy are a pretty stupid form of agricultural organization. The Soviet Army left and soon after, conscription in the Hungarian Army was abolished. Factories, kolkhoz buildings, all Soviet and some Hungarian military bases were left standing abandoned until airsoft became a thing here. And man, I love playing at those places. They have this very distinct atmosphere, as if you were playing S.T.A.L.K.E.R, but in real life. You can almost see the ghosts of the past.

The only problem is, some of these fields are insanely dangerous. Good boots are a must if you don't want your feet or ankles to get hurt, but they can't save you from everything. There was a case where my friend almost fell down a manhole at an old military base, not getting hurt only because of a good dose of luck. The manhole cover had been stolen by metal thieves. They will steal anything that is metal from these places, even entire staircases.

**Rules**

While event organizers in the US are apparently given a free hand in making up their own rules, we have a central set of rules (the MASZ; Magyar Airsoft Szabályzat; Hungarian Code of Airsoft) made by the most reputable figures in the country, the gods of Hungarian airsoft, residing somewhere in/around the Capital, Budapest (although most country folks like me kind of hate them). If you organize a game not using these rules, expect most people not to show up and aggregator sites to refuse to spread the word about it.

The ""Book"" regulates basic things like safety, FPS limits, what counts as a hit, what to do if someone doesn't call a hit (shoot again), etc, and leaves game mechanics like medics and respawning up to the organizer. It also categorizes weapons and sets up category-specific limitations, e.g. the maximum mag capacity of sniper rifles is 40 and 600 for any AEG unless it has a bipod or is the replica of a machine gun.

Organizers can amend this set of rules to make it stricter, but not more liberal.

**Players**

Players come from all ages and walks of life, like in most other countries. Women are rare, but we are happy to play with them and treat them equally. The oldest player I know is 49 and the youngest is 16 and the latter won't change. Why, you ask? Because the MASZ specifies the minimum age as 16 years. I often see that you regard 12-year-olds as a nuisance, we are free of them.

But it comes at a cost. Those younger than 16 often go playing illegally, without the property owner's permission, thereby committing trespassing and posing a great threat to themselves, others and us. They almost never get caught though, because people here take the law very lightly. There was an incident about two years ago, where a 13-year-old boy fell off the attic of a kolkhoz building at an illegal event and died on scene. It made national news. The press asked a central figure of Hungarian airsoft, who said that it had not been an airsoft-related accident, as this was an illegal event. I think it would have been preventable if we had let them play with us.

**Weapons and equipment**

Whenever someone here posts pictures of their collection, I think to myself ""these Americans and their shitloads of guns"". Our standard of life is not quite as good as that of those living in Western countries, so most of us can't afford that many guns. We mostly buy one gun and slowly upgrade that, replacing parts for better ones over the years. Of course, it is common to have an assault rifle and a sidearm, but two weapons of the same category are considered excessive. Snipers are rare because it is very expensive to build a good sniper rifle.

There are few stores in the country and we dislike them because most of them have high prices and bad business ethics. We mostly get our things from abroad and let skilled players do tech jobs, who do it for free. Customs are not a problem when importing stuff. That is because there are no customs inspections within the EU and even when ordering from elsewhere, (Russia, Hong Kong, etc) it is cheaper than buying the same thing at home.

That is all for now. Sorry for the wall of text and feel free to ask me anything.
tl;dr: greetings from Hungary, where things are different. Sorry, can't really sum this up.

Pretty happy with how it turned out.

The gun was originally a TM SR16 but everything other that the RIS and outer barrel is changed out.


You can probably see for yourself what ive done with it externally. Most noticeably is probably the new stock and grip. The body is a G&amp;P metal body. I also cut off the front sight with a dremel :P 


The internals are also completely changed out.
The gearbox is all Lonex, even the gearbox shell.
Barrel is a Prometheus 6.03 barrel. Hop up is a Prometheus NEO Strike chamber and uses a Prometheus purple rubber.

Thats all, currently waiting for a M600C flashlight copy to arrive fir it to be complete, atleast for now:)

These were acquired while working at a local store around 2007 or so.    

  
[MGC 10/22 SSS](http://i.imgur.com/UDdxXEI.jpg)

The MGC rifle was a NBB platform with no hop up. Buddies and I modified a TM AK hop up to work, although we had some alignment issues. Later, we chopped up a TM M4 plastic lower and attached it to the receiver. Running around with an 80 round midcap firing a NBB trigger left my fingers tired at the end of the day. Last modification was to drill and tap the Green gas reservoir and route a MagnumBB Cold Shot Unit.   
  
[Twin TM UZI's.](http://i.imgur.com/JlMtwAt)  

These were probably the most ""Don't-give-a-shit, Lets-have-fun!"" guns I have used. Picked them up as parts guns and found out that the sector gears had been blown. Sat on them for 3 months and luckily Den Trinity resupplied their UZI parts and I was able to fix them up again. 260 FPS Dual Wielding smg's of terror.
  
  
[KHC Maverick Shotgun](http://i.imgur.com/FLkWZvm)  
  

This was my fallback/workhorse. If I was out of battery juice or Co2, I pulled this beast out. Hopper-fed 4 barreled shogun, pretty much the predecessor to the TM Tri-Shot Benelli's. Shot 280 per bb and was near impossible to cock without that forward grip.  
  
[Maruzen M93r BV](http://i.imgur.com/sUHssrd)
60 round midcaps with semi and auto. Absolutely decimated on Pistol/Shotgun Nights. Sports an LRB and shoots a good 150 feet. Made a boop-boop-boop-boop-boop-boop sound when it fired.    
 
[Kokosai Crimebuster](http://i.imgur.com/Q5f83Mw)  
Did not hold onto this for too long. Ended up finding a very motivated buyer.   
  
[ToyTec M203  ](http://i.imgur.com/IK3ezrx)
  
Bought in this condition. The Toytec M203's were basically GBB smgs in an m203 body. The way the feed/barrel was setup lent the m203 to have a STUPID amount of hop up. Something like aiming at a man's feet to nail him in the torso at 50 feet with .28's.  Pull this out for WTF's and giggles. It had a simple ""recoil"" mechanism. Not so much recoil as it was a more rocking feeling.  
  
[Gen 1 Marushin M500 6mm](http://i.imgur.com/KAajCQp)  
  
So much fun, and so impractical. Had a 6.10mm barrel and was converted to external gas. Pretty rare in 2007, so I was allowed to use in a few cqb fields. Removed the limiter from 3 rounds to 5 rounds. Sold in 2009.    
  
[Custom M203 aka BOHICA](http://i.imgur.com/658WqhP)
Classic Army M203 on a Wooden frame with fixed stock, rails and a muzzle break. BOHICA + 15 various 40mm rounds and a satchel full of nerf rounds was my loadout for awhile. When using a PB4 + Nerf, the muzzle break actually worked and you can see a gusher of vapor direct sideways after firing. Was a trip.

[Tanaka M700](http://i.imgur.com/WlCpbxo)  
Tanaka M700 with upgraded G&amp;G internals, VSr-10 Hop up conversion and a MagnumBB Coldshot. Hogged out the stock on a remington 710 and dubbed her my ""Deer Hunter""
  
  
Sadly, sold most of these to cover tuition and textbook purchases. 
That is all of them for now. If I can find more, I'll post up later.

People  fail to grasp some pretty basic tactics that mean alot when the mag hits the receiver. I figured I'd list some basic things that will help any team, organized or pickup, do better. These mostly apply to CQB or short game modes on smaller fields, rather than games on fields that cover serveral acres.

-When the game starts, no matter what you want to push up as far as you can. In games with unlimited respawns, just run as far up as you can, then take cover somewhere that allows you to cover slower players as they come up on line. The idea is not just to get far up, but get to a spot that you can prevent the other team from doing the same.

-There are several different firing Techniques that should be used to help advance your team forward. Firing semi auto, in bursts of 3-5 rounds at ipen targets is a good way to get some kills on unexpecting players, but if they know you're there, you'll need to try something else. Suppressing fire is a huge part of a successful team. Suppressing fire is often overlooked as it can use a ton of ammo and, by definition does not produce hits. It simply keeps the enemy behind cover while a teammate positions himself better. This is key in gaining ground. suppressing fire doesn't need to be full auto, as long as the enemy knows you're firing at him, it will work. You can also use firing techniques to keep players from going places you don't want them. even if you cant get a clean shot on them. When you fire on a certain area, say the left side of a cover, any players behind it will naturally stay to the other side. If there's a cover a player is behind, and one side is particularly difficult to effectively engage, shoot at that side to guide the enemy to the easier side, where you can get a much easier hit. 

-Before the game starts, plan to allocate more players to one side of the field than the other. Have the weak side dig in where they can, then have the strong side bound forward using suppressing fire. If done right you will be able to engage players from multiple angles and take more ground faster than an even assault would.

I'm gonna stop there. I congratulate you if you made it all through.

So I usually mess around and plink, play seriously, but plink.

So my friend is covering me as I sprint to a vantage point.

I have no ammo and our previous place was unstable to stay in.

So I place in my mag and hear battle cries; Instincts activate and I fuckin bolt.

I turn around to see the enemies, a bunch of chubby kids with JG's chasing me with pool noodles and foam swords.

I snap my stock back and empty my 30round mag on them, or at least I try. I slam into a wooden bunker and tumble down the hill.

The kids proceed to kill my friend and chase me.

Im dizzy and confused but I sprint a little, me being a good runner, ive gained some distance from the prepubescent lard puffs. I shoot one bb at a kid before my bolt locks back. Damn. That was my last mag.

I pull out my pistol. Shit I forgot to fill the mag with bb's.

Now there are about 3 kids charging at me. I put away my weapons and deploy my guns bipod so it can stand and not get dirty.

I proceed to draw my foam axe.

*First swing* I whacked this kid in ths side of the head. He calls hit.

Now the the other one is drawing near and with his Jabba the hut buddy tailing about 20 meters away.

I go to attack, but he blocks. I draw my springer while blocking his foam pool noodle and shoot his sweat soaked shirt. He calls hit.

The next kid was nearly there. He looked so similar to Gabe Newell, I just lost it. I couldnt stop laughing.

By the time he reaches me crying and laughing on the ground the game time is over and its a draw.

Small gallery: http://imgur.com/a/34iNS

All of my CADPAT gear comes from cpgear.com (Wheeler's) and is definitely 100% real/authentic CADPAT - no, it's not illegal for civilians/non-Canadians to get CADPAT (that's a gross misinterpretation of ""it would be illegal for a soldier to sell the gear off his back that his government issued him"").

The BDU top is the OTW Shirt, and the pants are sadly no longer listed on CPGEAR (they're pretty good quality - normal pants pockets, plus large butt pockets and 2 large thigh pockets, sad to see they're not listed on their site anymore).

On my head is their CADPAT boonie - I also have a skullcap (actually on underneath the hat... strange habit but it keeps my head camouflaged if my hat gets snagged by a tree branch and winds up on my back). I do have a ""Jesse James Mask"" as CPgear calls it, which is basically a face-bandana with velcro. I usually wear that over my pasty white Alaskan face when I'm playing (I'm also in ESS goggles and not sunglasses).

Finally, the vest. It's the MoFOCR (Modular Fighting Order Carrier Rig... pretty sure that's a backronym!) with 3 double mag pouches, a generic utility pouch, and a medical pouch (basically the generic utility pouch with some internal retention abilities and it zips to fold open instead of just from the top). On my back is a 3L hydration carrier for my P* air tank, and a CADPAT hydration tube cover to cover most of my air hose.

Then there's the P* gun... I built that up from scratch (which is the most expensive way to do it), but it was built to have a mixture of OD, FDE, and black parts on it so that I didn't have a 100% black gun that stuck out against my CADPAT gear. It used to be shorter (9"" REC7 barrel and 7"" DD Lite rail) but I decided to get a little crazy this weekend and throw the longest barrel I could find in it - a ~509mm (I think) inner barrel in a 20"" outer barrel: it stuck out past the outer barrel a bit so I grabbed the ridiculously long suppressor off of my old APS2 and threw it on there (the brass threads for the APS2 are on the business end - that's the silly brass color you can see at the end of the suppressor). I'd like to get a shorter suppressor for this, but keep the long barrel, as it's tuned to DMR specs for our field.",,False,,t5_2qi2x,False,,,True,t3_1i9j5f,http://www.reddit.com/r/airsoft/comments/1i9j5f/my_cadpat_almost_in_its_natural_environment/,

Good platform but there is just way too many. Why not be different and unique instead of just getting another M4? The reasoning people buy M4s is usually ""there's a lot of parts and mags for them."" So, what guns are M4 compatible? What guns use M4 mags? What guns use V2 gearboxes? Or both.

**Guns that use M4 mags.**

Real Sword Type 97

G36 w/ m4 magwell. Easy to install.

Famas with small modifications. Unfortunately you're still stuck with a mediocre body and terrible gearbox design.

PDW

Type 89

SL8 W/ M4 magwell. Same as G36

Tavor

L85

FNC

F2000 (Already seen this catch on locally. Very happy about that. Love the F2000)

Scar-L

Sig 556

APS UAR

Robinson Armament XCR

ACR

Magpull PTS PDR

JG's Ika Zuchi (IE the tumor M4)

M249 can but who's not going to be using the box mag?

Echo 1 AR57 (Not out yet)

P90 with box mag if that counts

ICS L86

MK46


Sure I've missed more guns here.

**Guns that use a V2 gearbox.**


PDW

FNC

Scar

XCR

ACR (Depends on the manufacturer. Some use an odd V3)

JG's Ika Zuchi (IE the tumor M4)

Echo 1 AR57

MP5

This list could get huge and I'm sure there's a ton more. 

There's some disadvantages like external parts usually not working. Some exceptions. I don't really care to ""tacticool"" my gun up though. Granted I get how convenient extra parts are. I think it's worth it to have something different and unique. Let's not even get into how many guns use V3s and V6 gearboxes and how easy parts are to get for those.

I turned the corner and surrendered them both. But when I turned the corner the kid who I wasn't chasing had his gun down and brought it up and yelled surrender after I had already surrendered him. I continued to play cause I felt he was out and I wasn't (the field's rules even say the adjusting player is out) but then people yelled at me that I was out. They started yelling at me to learn the rules etc. I didn't argue and stopped playing cause I figured if all these people were yelling at me then I was probably wrong. But the round ended right after and people were mad at me. I apologized and said I wouldn't do it again but I genuinely feel I had the drop on those two and they didn't know I was coming. But maybe I was wrong. I even admitted I might have been wrong and apologized but people were still mad at me. The next round this guy shot me with a grenade launcher point blank (i dont even know if they're allowed because ive never seen anyone use them) and mumbled something about me being a cheater. I'm not a cheater. I take pride in playing honorably. I mean I call myself out if a bb just whizzes past my ear and I can feel the wind cause I know the other player is going to think he hit me if it was that close and I don't want to be branded a cheater I even called myself out on my own ricochet today cause I heard something hit my helmet and only later realized that it was my own ricochet.

WOAH, WOAH

HOLD THE FUCK UP, HOMESTUCK

I know what you're thinking, the fuck is this shit? Cheap ANSI rated glasses AND cheap as fuck inserts? Yes, kid, you heard me right.

For a long time now, I've been wearing my prescription lenses WITH my ESS NVG's. This was stupid and awkward. My glasses would fog up easily because of this, and it was just uncomfortable as all shit. Well, I went to the mall, went to Oakley, got a quote for like 300-400 dollars. The fuck is that shit? Do I look like I shit money?

So I said nope. Was going to stick with my awkward prescrips + NVG's.

Well, I went online, saw those fancy inserts you can use.

Went to my local damn store, asked ""hey, fuckers, how much would it cost to get this shit done, nah meen?"" and they be all like ""200 dollars"".

Fuck that.

Went home, jerry rigged me some damn homemade inserts with old lenses.

Fuck that too. There's this thing called PD, or pupillary distance or some shit. It fucks you. It makes your eyes strain if the lenses are not set correctly.

So, I was like, fuck that, prescrips + NVG's.

Went online, googled this shit. Saw this shit called rx-safety nah meen. Saw that I could get some ESS ICE's + inserts + prescrip lenses for 120.

Wwaaaaaaatttttttttt, so I ordered them, placed my prescription in that shit, and waited 5 days. Got them in the mail.

Bam. ANSI rated poly-carb lenses in the front to take shotgun blasts from and still have my lenses; I'd probably die from that, but it's ok, my eyes are safe. The insert behind that shit, and I see clear, no fog issues, and I can take out this exact insert and place it in my NVG's.

Win, win.

Now I don't look like a bitch with my full seal goggles, awkwardly placed prescriptions. Now I look GMRpls. ",,False,,t5_2qi2x,False,,,True,t3_1khbjk,http://www.reddit.com/r/airsoft/comments/1khbjk/to_people_who_hate_wearing_their_prescription/,

**Background**:North Korea is about to launch a missile towards the united states. But first they have to take nuclear materials (box with bottles of Gatorade) from a refinery to a missile silo. Once they reach the missile silo they have to transfer the materials to a missile (move it form one box to another 10ft away) and defend it until they finish calculations to launch (a series of easy math questions).

**Mission objective**: The Americans have to intercept the materials or identify the materials by taking a picture of them and sending it to HQ (send a text with the picture of the Gatorades to game control). once the message has been sent the North Koreans have 10 minutes to finish the calculations, until air support destroys the silo (game over)

**How North Koreans win**: They have to transfer the radioactive materials and finish the calculations, getting at at least 80% percent of them correct.

**Special players**:

* Scientists: both sides have scientists that are the only people allowed to carry the radioactive materials. Scientists are heavily armored, have no guns, and can only be killed by melee (two hand touch). North Korea has more than the Americans.

* Medics: both sides also have medics. The number of medics is dependent on the number of players Medics take 20 
seconds to heal a person **note people can spawn without medics by walking outside the battle and waiting for a 
minute. So the game is not over when the medics die.**

WHAT!?) and I gotta say I love it. http://imgur.com/a/lmptn 

It shoots Semi-auto only, about 380-390. although I heard that if you clean up the bucking from the silicon oil, it shoots about 430.I haven't got the chance to test the  range or grouping yet.

Disassembly on this quite easy and fast. It should be able to be taken apart and back together in under 10 minutes or so.( I had trouble with some parts but after the initial assembly it should be a breeze.)

There are some things to be careful with. The spade connectors are a bit loose, so careful when tugging the connector out. The front piece is held by a tiny hex screw under the front sight. This piece literally keeps the gun together so it is very important. Also I gotta admit that shooting it as an AEG isn't as fun as if it were a gas blowback, but that's just a minor nitpick for me. 

This is a nice skirmishable gun(40 bbs for each magazine and you get two magazines.) for devoted WWII fans.With the price tag, I can understand how it might not be for everyone. This was my purchase of the year though and I am very happy with my purchase.

I set up a [beta website](http://www.aegbuilder.com) for experienced and knowledgeable airsofters to sign up. I'm looking for experienced airsofters who know their way around an AEG. [Here](http://www.aegbuilder.com/?page_id=41) is a bit more info on how I plan on doing the beta.

The purpose is to get a good group of people together who can translate their knowledge into the database so new airsofters and other people who aren't as experienced can get efficient access to this knowledge. I think it'd help the sport out a lot if it gets big and comprehensive enough.

There is a bit of incentive to do the work of putting in the compatibility info, so I'm offering prizes and stuff but haven't worked out the details of how it would work yet (voting, points and using those points as ""raffle tickets"" is the current idea).
Development wise we are behind schedule because of some problems we ran into but I am still very much committed to the project since I got bit by the airsoft bug (been going every weekend to my local CQB place!) and it'd be awesome if the sport was more mainstream and had more players.

Topic of today's Story Sunday:  Best Kill Streaks.

Mine:  I had to rush a tower with my friends offering fire support behind me.  I was using my G&amp;G UMG and nothing else, which i would soon learn why that was a bad idea.  Around 10ft into the building, i made contact with my first enemy, took him nicely, and proceeded to clear the other 10 guys out.  Rushing a staircase, i made contact with around 5 more guys, three i downed with my gun, two with a well placed grenade.  Now rushing the last point of the tower, i turn a corner and run into a guy, literally.  We both laid on the ground, and he reached for his shotgun before i could reach for my UMG.  I took a tri-shot to the face from 3ft away.  Ouch.

http://imgur.com/a/F01dH

I play the majority of my games in a CQB arena, which is why the majority of these are focused on CQB combat.

Guns included:

G&amp;G GR300, 330 fps

TM 5-7, don't have an fps currently :(

UTG Tri-Shot

KWA Mp7, 340 fps with CQB bolt. Don't remember with High-Power

And lastly, my pride and joy,

G&amp;P M4, 320 fps CQB, 398 with Carbine.

The G&amp;P was built from the ground up over the course of a year and a half to get to the point its at now.  Took so long because I'm dirt poor xD

Main Parts list:
All G&amp;P externals, Zombie Killer lower, Fighting Cat upper/front for CQB

Crane Stock (only non-metal section apart from the handgrip)

G&amp;P Carbine length RIS front/upper for field use.

Internals:

G&amp;P m120 motor

G&amp;P Standard gear set

G&amp;P full metal short-stroked piston

Guarder Bore-Up kit for the cylinder
    
--Cylinder
    
--Piston head
   
 --Air nozzle

G&amp;P M120 Spring

ProWin Hop-Up Chamber(x2, one for cqb and one for carbine)

Prometheus 208mm, 6.03 inner barrel for CQB

Prometheus 363mm, 6.03 inner barrel for Carbine

Wiring is currently Deans, I changed it when I installed the Crane stock. At first, it was small tamiya, wired to the front, and I used a PEQ-box style battery. 

I grew sick of this quickly and got the crane to free up rail space, and make life a little easier. I do miss the standard M4 style stock, and the ability to look for other stock styles due to having to rely on the crane for battery storage.

Let me know what you think!

No, really. This website, http://www.airsoftanswers.com/ , should be posted in the sidebar. It's essentially a ""Yahoo Answers"" for airsoft related questions and seems like it would greatly benefit from more traffic and exposure. That, and **you** can even edit the FAQ on r/airsoft [here](http://code.reddit.com/wiki/help/faqs/airsoft?action=edit) to have more in-depth guides on how to fix things among other questions.



I believe speak for many when I say that I have no problem when people ask good questions, but when they ask questions without searching well or even bothering to google it, then this is why we see ""DARP DARP MY AFG GRIP DUSNT FIT WUT AM DO"" type questions plaguing the front page.



Searching. Isn't. Hard. Seriously, http://www.google.com is your best friend. I use more than I want to admit. Most of the time there is someone out there that has/had the same exact problem you are looking the answer for. You can't be helpless. Type in key word of whatever your problem may be, look at diagrams online to find the name of the part you broke, find the part in an online store to find the name of it, its all there for you. The internet is filled with countless guides regarding airsoft. [Here](http://mashable.com/2011/11/24/google-search-infographic/) is an awesome guide that shows you how you can search way more effectively to gather the information you seek. *""Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime.""*



The same questions just clutter up the page and bring down the cool threads like the occasional ""memorable stories"" or people making threads showing off their inexpensive ghillies.

I will go ahead and share mine. I was at the  field and a few guys from my squad and 1 other squad were pinned down. One of the kids was about 12 and had a [very expensive gun](http://www.airsoftgi.com/product_info.php?products_id=3823) (yes this is the exact model he had, I didn't just choose the most expensive model I saw). I asked him to lay down some covering fire so we could move. Just my luck the kid is using .12 bbs that are just flying everywhere. We got lucky and a few guys from a different squad flanked flanked them and we were able to get out of there. When that game was over I approached the kid and asked him where he got his gun, as you might expect, his parents bought it for him. I told him he probably shouldn't use .12 gram bbs because they were inaccurate past 10ft and would destroy his gun. His response ""I only use .12s because I want a super high FPS"" I tried to explain to him fps didn't matter and accuracy was more important but of course he wasn't having it. 
Note: He also had a TON of gear. A bunch of flashbangs, a GBB that I don't know the brand of, a nice plate carrier, tons of mags and pouches, a helmet with a go-pro on it, and full multicam.

I know many of the people that come here asking about starter guns aren't even legal driving age yet, so here are some things I catch kids doing.

You damned squeakies got some reading to do.

* Thou shalt not ask others if they want to sell their things.

This is rude beyond compare, and is insultingly demeaning to the person you're asking.  It doesn't matter how much you're offering for it, piss off.  All you'll end up doing is pissing the person off.  Some of us take great lengths to find our stuff and treasure it.  Unless someone specifically mentions they have something for sale, do not ask.

* Thou shalt not try to hock YOUR stuff

This is mostly aimed at wandering hockers. Unless you expect some serious lowballs, don't try to sell your stuff at the field.  Don't expect to get anywhere near what you paid either.  We don't know the condition, how many rounds have been through it, how often you cleaned it, or if you were a retard and got silicone oil in your hop-up.  We can't even be sure you didn't just grab it off the table over yonder and are trying to fence stolen goods.  We don't want it.  This goes double for places that have a shop attached.  That's kind of rude to the people running the store.

* Thou shalt not judge other people's equipment, lest ye be judged.

Not everyone has mommy and daddy's platinum card to max out at Evike.com.  Most of us work for a living.  Most of us don't see the point in spending a few grand on a full costume when a uniform, vest and gun is all we really need.  Don't judge other peoples' guns. (Compliments are always welcome though)  Even the kid showing up with the clear Sporting Goods Store Special.  Even the most experienced Milsimmer can be taken out by a transparent green pump springer.  This however doesn't apply to team assignment. Nobody should be stuck on a team of rentals and springers while the other side has guys with highly modified AEGs with high ROF gearboxes.

* Thou shalt not bum gear off strangers.

I don't care if you give me collateral, piss off.  I barely lend to my friends, what makes you think I'm going to lend some scrub I just met one of my rifles that costs on average $150.  I've seen loaners come back with broken magazines, cracked receivers, lunched gears, etc.  Sometimes they don't come back at all.  So, no.   You should have brought your own gun.

* Thou shalt bring your own ammo.

Unless we're talking a several hour long Operation, you should be able to stretch your hi-cap mag for a quick 4 round skirmish.  I'm not giving you one of my magazines, loaded with MY ammo, both costing me money.  See previous commandment above for other reasons why you shouldn't bum stuff.  And I swear to god if I see another kid wandering the field asking if anybody has BBs, I will shoot them myself, regardless of team.  If you're out of ammo, you're out of the game.  Period. Head back to the safe area and resupply.

* If thou hast borrowed something, make an OBSESSIVE effort to return it.

Don't assume because the person who lent it to you isn't hounding you that you get to keep something.  They might have either forgotten, or haven't been able to find you yet.  If someone was foolish enough to lend you something, make an obsessive effort to return it.

* Thou Shalt not touch!

If it ain't yours, don't touch it.  If you didn't drop it, don't pick it up.  If you didn't throw it, don't retrieve it.  Leave things where they lay.  You may oogle someone's gun at their table, but unless you are offered permission to touch it, or you ask for such, do not touch it.

* Thou. shalt. not. steal.

My shit is labelled in several locations including internal locations you wouldn't even begin to know about.  If you steal my shit, I'll break your fingers.  Multiple times.  With pliers.  I always have pliers.  I WILL go fucking old school on you.  If you see someone else stealing, MAKE SOME NOISE.  Make it abundantly clear what you see, make it very conspicuous.  Stop the thief from leaving by all legal means.  There is a degree of honor and faith in each other intrinsic to Airsoft, both on and off the field.  Lets not steal from each other, and lets make it clear that theft will NEVER be tolerated or turned a blind eye towards it.",,False,,t5_2qi2x,1369817601.0,,,True,t3_1f9bh6,http://www.reddit.com/r/airsoft/comments/1f9bh6/some_general_commandments_that_arent_covered_in/,

Each upper is distinct, so they all have their own hopup and inner barrel. This means I can literally just pop the front pin out, slide off one upper, and slide on any other upper I want. They are configured as a 14.5"" with a M203 (barrel mounted), 14.5"" with a free float 7"" DD Lite rail, and a 8"" with a DD Lite Rail and integral suppressor. Been thinking of changing the 14.5"" barrel on the second upper for a 12"" barrel, but we'll see.

[Here's a video of an upper swap, pretty old, before I switched bodies, did internal work, and put together the M203 launcher and before I went LiPo on it](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-Ke8yfLBrc#t=08m29s)

Total cost for the externals (the rifle pictures with all 3 uppers) is $624. This doesn't count accessories, like magazines, M203 shells, M203 charger, EOTech (replica), etc etc. If you add all of that on there, it makes it a LOT more expensive, but I view all of those as general items. The only ones that get used only with this platform are the M203 shells, which I only spent about $160 on, which for 4 CO2 shells with the madbull CO2 charger, is an amazing deal. ($350+ new for just those)

I see quite a few people who call themselves snipers on the field wearing ghillie suits. Truth is, not all ghillies are created equal, but they all are for the same job, to break up your outline.

*First off, a brief history (TBH: I'm tl;dring the Wikipedia page)*

They were invented by Scottish gamekeepers to resemble heavy foliage and to be used as a portable hunting blinds. The first military unit to use them were the British Army's Lovat scouts in 1916.

Ghillies are a type of artificial cryptic camouflage, basically meaning it's man-made and it is supposed to make you blend into your background. It breaks up the noticeable shape of the human outline; most noticeable are your head and shoulders. 

Some do this better than others. Any ghillie that you buy [premade](http://www.gandermountain.com/modperl/product/details.cgi?pdesc=Red-Rock-Outdoors-Mens-5-Piece-Ghillie-Suit&amp;i=451990&amp;r=view&amp;aID=503I1&amp;cvsfa=2586&amp;cvsfe=2&amp;cvsfhu=343531393930&amp;s_kwcid=goobasecontent_goobasecontent_filler&amp;cID=GSHOP_451990) will take serious work to even be usable. I'll break it down: first, there is black in it, which isn't common enough to be needed or wanted in a ghillie. Second: those types are SUPER bright compared to the pictures and wont blend in to anything until you get it dirty and beat the hell out of it. Third: the texture is the same every where if you don't use vegetation which is hard because it doesn't come with any places for you to put it. This being said, the best choices ae for you to make one yourself, or to buy one second hand off someone who knew what they were doing.

Making one yourself will give you the maximum amount of customization, both in style and color choice. I made my own, and it was actually a fun project that kept me off the Xbox and 360 for a while. There are hundreds of guides on Google and Youtube, so I'm not going to get into that, but I will tell you mine is made from scratch, based off a full set of Woodland Tiger stripe, and is a crawler type. I sewed all of my netting on the blouse and boonie, cut, dyed and destrung all of my burlap,  and tied all of my jute on.

You have several choices to make when considering building one: What is my AO? What color's should I use? Where should I put jute? How will I attach netting? 

For Woodland AO's: Greens and browns, varying in darnesses for both are your best bet, Desert AO's: Tan's and browns, with a little light green is probably your best bet. 

For the style of ghillie, look to your playing style. If you spend alot of time prone, use a crawler (Jute on the back of blouse and pant only) so you don't get hung up on everything. If you play with an AEG and need access to a chest rig or plate carrier, considering making a home-made [viper hood](http://www.tacticalconcealment.com/pd-viper-hood.cfm) if you don't wan't to blow your budget. If you don't fit either of those, maybe a full body ghillie with jute on everything would be best, then again, it will weigh a ton and be very hot. For the hood vs. Boonie debate, I use a Boonie, that's just what I had, I think I'd prefer it over a hood though. 

Another thing you could use is a [Ghillie TOG/Webtex Concealment Vest](http://www.amazon.com/Sniper-Ghillie-Foundation-Hydration-Compatible/dp/B00655C426) which takes out a whole aspect of construction. I have never used these but a fellow sniper, *RangerScarecrow*, offered to lend a hand with some [pictures](http://imgur.com/a/R9DF4) of one in action. Thanks Scarecrow!

As for attaching netting, I sewed every other square on with the upholstery thread which is very strong, the backed that up with super glue.

If your going to dye your own burlap and destring it, be prepared, it is fairly messy and time consuming. I used dye from Tactical Concealment, and I find it the best because you don't have to darken/lighten any of the colors to get what you want, you can just buy them.

As a rule of thumb, Ghillies are very hot and require you to drink alot more and be aware of your own condition while playing. Make sure you dont over do it and take it off when ever possible to avoid heat stroke and drink plenty to fend off dehydration.

One more thing. be aware of ''black holes'' caused by your muzzle and more often your scope. [Here](http://i.imgur.com/oIQhy.jpg) is an otherwise badass photo of me, ruined by my scope looking like a giant black blob and my rifle rag being too tan. They can be solved by adding a killflash over your scope's lense, either a slit type or netting type.

That's all folks! Thanks for reading. As usual, AMA about ghillies and/or concealing yourself on the field.

I've been using airsoft to motivate me to be healthier for a while now, but with admin'ing etc. it lost the push it used to give me when I just went out an played...and huffed and puffed. I started smoking in the Marines, almost exactly 19 years ago. My days of my body being able to absorb the abuse of smoking while running 5 miles in body armor (and still drunk from the night before) are past. 

I've been wanting to quit for a while, but the more I thought about that 30 (fucking) hour Op in a Georgia summer sank home that I need to get my shit wired ASAP if I want to truly enjoy it and kick ass. I pulled my weight at SoCo (and home games) in 110°+/100% humidity, and I imagine how much additional booty stomping I can do with some more PT and no smoking.

I may be rambling, but I realized something awesome about airsoft, particularly MilSim (and similar sports I guess) after a long discussion with wifey, as she was upset that airsoft (and not her) was giving me the kick to get in shape/quit smoking; this hobby/sport/wtf-ever allows me as an adult professional man, to go out and safely synthesize a lot of what it is to be a primal male.

Also, when a football is thrown, how fast do you think it is thrown? Maybe 50 fps tops? Well, you are throwing an object much heavier and less aerodynamic than a bb at a speed 7 or 8 times slower, yet you can hit a person right in the chest at 150 feet. You know why?

I had previously posted my GlockPod a few times on here, but never given it its own post. So, here you go. 


It's a CYMA CM030 G18C AEP with a rail mount, as well as a rail to rail coupler made out of two M4 carry handles. It's easily able to be mounted and dismounted to pretty much any gun with a rail. You can also push the button at the rear of the slide to pop the gun itself out in case you need to use it on its own. 



So, why did I make the GlockPod? Double the firepower is one reason, two guns popping off at full auto is certainly terrifying. Also, when attached to a high powered gun, you can use the relatively low powered glock inside your MED if someone gets close without having to switch to your secondary. Plus, it's just awesome. I'm probably going to make a new video of this gun soon.

Well I finally got the SR25 lower back (thanks Zardicahr, sounds great!) and decided to make a mock up of the SR-16. SR25 still needs a little work done (externally only, I'm missing a single part for the PRS stock that stops the wobbling, and the Noveske rail likes to wobble too...), but otherwise it's practically done (I also need a scope...I only have $20 in my bank account though D:). The SR16 is nowhere near done yet, in these photos it's using a custom JG gearbox that needs deans, but that box is intended to go into an SR15 I'm putting up for sale soon (need deans and some external parts for it still). I just slapped the gearbox in there and put together the rest for fun. The G&amp;P gearbox I'm planning to use for it is nowhere near done. But I think it looks good. It's pictured alongside the SR25 and the two CQB N4s in the second album, all looking sexy as hell.

[My guns](http://i.imgur.com/VV12oklh.jpg)


______________________________________________________________________________


[My Primary](http://i.imgur.com/UxmEhqch.jpg): Real Sword Type 56-1. Please excuse the rotation.

This gun is my *pride and joy*. You can't really say much to justify the greatness of a company which designed its own gearbox to break free from the original Marui design (which wasn't real steel spec) just so that they could use de-milled Norinco type 56's as externals.
 
Internal upgrades include:
 
* A Prometheus purple bucking (which really wasn't necessary) 

* [A real steel railed sight](http://i.imgur.com/pASw51q.jpg), which I added for ease of aiming. Not that I aim anyway :). 

Of course though, I have a backup gun. If something goes wrong with the RS, or more frequently, when it is so hot outside that using the T56 would give me third degree burns. Steel gets hot, even on a gun as cool as the Real Sword. 

______________________________

[Tokyo Marui Ak-47](http://i.imgur.com/rSZajWmh.jpg).

Not much to say about this gun. Though I could most likely snap this in half if I dropped it or fell on it, the internals are this are just like the real sword. 

They'll **never** break, and has a hop up that would make even the most Upgraded stock guns pale in comparison. 

____________________________

My Sidearm- The infamous WE Browning Hi-Power. 

The biggest failure I own.......I still love it. 

There is **no hop-up unit** on it. Coupled with the extremely heavy trigger pull, getting kills at 100 feet is quite the task.

But I love the real steel design, so I use it. Besides, I reason that I shouldn't be engaging people at a 150 feet anyway, so it's fine. (this is my failed attempt at justifying my love of an awful weapon). 

_____________________________________________________________________________________

[Anti tactical/swagpul Vest](http://i.imgur.com/wBKozvth.jpg) - I don't care much for what I use for vests as long as it is **practical** and it **works**, which is why I use this simple molle vest. It's light, fully customizable, I can run 8 mags at a time, and I won't have a heatstroke in it. It's just great for me. 

[My complete loadout](http://i.imgur.com/8exDPiOh.jpg) - It isn't the prettiest or the high-speediest low-draggiest by any means. But it's extremely cheap (save the guns), and It is beyond practical. I know that it will always function, just like my Real Sword and Marui, and that's what matters for me.


__________________________________________________________________

[Bonus Picture](http://i.imgur.com/DgYg5EW.jpg) - It's the cat by Nature, which is a really good company. I've only done some external upgrades, as I really like the Block II Americat look.

Otherwise I've left it completely stock for 10 years and it still runs incredibly well. External quality is on par with real sword.

Reddit's content is driven by the people and judged by the people. This subreddit's content is so unoriginal and boring because it is so tightly monitored by the mods. Shouldn't we be able to choose what is good and what is bad? It is our choice what gets upvoted and what gets downvoted. Mods are here just to monitor what is going on, they are not here to ban this and ban that. 

Some say we should create a new subreddit for loadouts, guns and whatnot. Why would we spread our small subreddit of 5,500 to several tiny subreddits? We should not have a to create a subreddit for this when we already have one right here! Out of the 5,500 subs only a couple hundred are actually active, most are people who no longer care to see the repetitive posts here. 

This subreddit will die and everyone will leave if this is not fixed. I for one do not want to see this happen. Could the mods please listen to what the people have to say? This is our subreddit and we drive everything that happens on it. Why can't we choose what happens here? 

Thanks for listening what I have had to say everybody. 

EDIT: The point I am trying to get across is that the mods will not give what the community really wants. The community drives the subreddit and the mods dont trust the community. After the whole DMR incident mods cracked down but what they did was not helpful. People could still post their ""DMR"" through a text post but they didn't. The mods have decided to punish us for the actions of few. They have been choking the whole subreddit of content for over 6 months now! I just say its been long enough and its time to get it back.

Compiled from varies previous posts
The exact web address is not listed, to find it, google it (duh)


1) EVIKE.com - just kidding just kidding 

But really-


1) Clandestine Airsoft - great for internal parts, and parts that are difficult to obtain elsewhere. Seems they have pretty competitive prices as well. Nice quality - SHS, Lonex, etc. 

2) Airsoft Store Canada - I live in the US and have personally ordered from here. Pretty much a Canadian version of Clandestine. Many internal parts and they stock only the best! Very competitive prices and reasonably priced + quick shipping.
(exact web address: airsoftstore.ca)

3) Ehobby Asia - from the reviews, this Asian company has low prices on good products but ships rather slow. A good trade off if you do not need what you order quickly. I have visited the sight looking for gear, and they stock quite a few products. 

4) Tiger Tactical Airsoft - being a US retailer AND having their website set up like it is makes this a great choice. Many options for selecting the right gear/guns/parts you need. Here is an example. I wanted an M4 magazine. So I went to magazines &gt; AEG/Electric &gt; M4/M16, and BAM ! They had many different types and brands I had not known about. 

5) Your local Airsoft shop/store - yes, it may cost a bit more, but if you need some shims or a new piston and you need it soon, the best place without paying outrages overnight shipping, is your local store. Supporting them is also important, and surprisingly, the tac gear at my shop is about the same as online. 

Sorry I couldn't research these more, ran out of time !

As a South Floridian I've always had trouble finding good places to play, and judging by other posts on this subreddit I'm not alone. What they're trying to do is raise money to build this airsoft exclusive field. They already have the land, and all the approval they need from Palm Beach County to go ahead and build the field. From what I've read the main cost problem is building a fence around the field, as it will be located in a public park. Obviously its necessary to shield other park goers from stray BB's.

Now we get to the good stuff, the awesome giveaways they're doing to fundraise. They've received donations for these giveaways from airsoft GI and other companies. Firstly [this](http://sfaainc.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/sig-e1358717169886.png?w=590&amp;h=393) is what they will be giving away to one of the FB page's fans once it reaches 3,000 likes. Secondly there is [this raffle](http://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash4/382330_511579435550109_820420132_n.png) going on.

Anyway, I just thought I would share this with you guys because the thought of a county sanctioned airsoft field is pretty cool. I'm surprised the county signed off on this and is giving them land inside a public park to do this. For one, you would expect the reaction from county board directors to be more along the lines of ""Guns in a public park? Are you crazy? You're teaching our children violence!"" But I guess they're looking at it more along the logical lines of if we give people a safe place to play, there wont be so many playing airsoft in dangerous areas where they aren't supposed to.

1) When you are finished shooting your gun (AEG's) and not going to use it for at least 24 hours, fire it twice on semi. This decompresses the spring.

2) always carry an extra mag (or two) than you need, there have been many situations where I have run out if ammo. Unless you use high caps.

3) Take time to pick a tactical vest. You cannot just ""go get a vest"". Figure out what is going to suit your needs and then go from there. Find the right style: are you LMG gunner or a person who rushes ahead? Do you need a few mags for short games or many for lengthy games.

4) Choose your BB's Wisely. Walmart or Academy Crossman BBs arent going to cut it. Invest in a good brand like King Arms, Matrix, or other Name brand stuff. Just remember, many a gun has been destroyed by bad BBs.
Always buy.2 or better BBs. I personally use .23 or .27 for better range.

5)Lube up those gas guns. My KWA MKII was ruined by me not properly Lubricating my gun. Silicone oil works well, and using green gas will greatly help.

I saw this video over on the r/milsim.

Note the use of a blank firing REAL shotgun to simulate the use of real shotgun rounds to shoot the hinges off the door.  To me, the use of real guns anywhere close to airsoft guns is about as stupid as you can get.  Ask Brandon Lee whether or not a blank round can kill you (mistakes happen, maybe there's a rock stuck in the barrel of that shotgun).

Note the lack of ear pro on most of the people in that video when shooting that real shotgun, and when using the simulated bangers (probably Thunder Bs or something similar)

Note the piss poor room entry done by a lot of the guys in the video (I understand they're training, but why would you not show the results of the training).

I have no objection to doing CQB training for airsoft.  I've attended and taught them.  What I DO have a problem with is the lack of basic safety in an airsoft environment.

Please, don't be these guys.

Edit: Holy shit, how did I miss this the first time?  At 0:36, one guy is pointing what appears to be the REAL SHOTGUN AT THE GUY ON THE GROUND!

[The album is here.](http://imgur.com/a/hqe5P)

The SVD is an old CA SVD that I got for cheap. Highly upgraded, but I'm not sure of the specifics. It does perform extremely well though, a very capable DMR/sniper rifle. It's a bit externally beat up though, as you can see.

*EDIT- what I do know about the SVD is that it has a real steel optic, and that almost nothing internally is stock. The only part I specifically know about for a fact is the Bravo AMU #3 computerized MOSFET which it has, it gives it a very nice trigger response, despit having 4 gears to pull and pulling an insanely heavy spring. The gun chronos at about 550 fps on .20's.

My PC is a FirstSpear Strandhögg. I'm not sure if anyone else on here has one of these, it's not very common. In my opinion, it's the best PC on the market, it's extremely light and versatile, still being able to carry everything I need for a long game. I have a Tactical Tailor triple M4 pouch and Blue Force Gear ten speed triple M4 pouch on the front giving me room for 6 mags, plus two more that I keep on my belt. I have a PIG three liter hydration carrier on the back for water and my Polarstar air tank when I'm using that. I also have my team patch, callsign patch, and /r/airsoft patch on my hydration carrier.

*EDIT- I use foam cutouts in my PC because I find them to be much more comfy than regular dummy plates. They are soft and cushioned but also provide rigidity. It's like wearing a cloud.

I just looked over the wiki and it seemed to confirm my research so far.  I was wondering if you guys could provide me with some input as well, so I could hear from some of the experts.

I am a medic instructor at a National Guard schoolhouse that teaches a variety of classes to units deploying.  We're trying to ramp up the training a bit in our MOUT shoothouse for our tactical lanes where students are tested on the skills they received in a simulated real-world environment, so we're looking into airsoft.  We want them to be able to demonstrate their skills while simulated rounds are flying.  I'm looking for a bulk order of about a dozen or so AEGs, preferably with metal externals (or at least something durable that will stand up to heavy usage).  The budget is semi-flexible, but we're aiming for a dozen at $150 or so per gun.  It has to be an M4/M16 variant.  We're not worried too much about mag changes to cut down on parts that can get lost.. The intent is to just have something we can use indoors, so that also means we don't need anything that shoots super far (and since paintball and sim-rounds are a no-go indoors).

1) I'm leaning towards G&amp;G or ICS.  Just need a base model that's reliable and will stand up to abuse.  Thoughts?  Any other brands?

2) How long do these batteries last before a recharge is needed?  I'm thinking we'll need a few backup batteries and chargers.

3)  Will a local store carry this much stock where I could walk in and make a purchase, or should I look primarily online?

4)  Anywhere I may be able to bring the price down per gun with a bulk order like this?

Thanks guys.",,False,,t5_2qi2x,False,,,True,t3_1g2ymh,http://www.reddit.com/r/airsoft/comments/1g2ymh/info_for_a_military_member_and_airsoft_noobie/,

My other gun isn't working right now, and I didn't actually own a vest until then.) So thanks ASGI! Luv ya gais &lt;3

Now here comes the ""Sort of..."". I got and unboxed that package late last night, and so didn't get to play around with it until today. So I charged up my battery, loaded up a mag, donned a badass mask, set up a target, lined up my red dot, and squeezed the trigger... Nothing. I flip it to auto and try again. Nothing. I go back inside, charge the battery (pointless, the thing was full anyway) and try. Nothing. Upside down. Nothing.
And by nothing I mean absolutely nothing. No engine turning, no gearbox movement. Absolutely nothing happened. I checked the fuse, which might have been tripped during its rough journey across the country or something, but it was in perfect condition. 
I'm hesitant to open this thing up. I Googled this, and what seemed likely to me is that the motor connectors were undone. I've never dealt with a motor before. I feel like I'll screw it up beyond repair or something. It's brand new, and I'm not entirely sure what that'll do to my warranty if I have to send it back.

There's alot of banter about whether or not it is legal/illegal to remove them.

Here is the federal law, word for word.

&gt; No person shall manufacture, enter into commerce, ship, transport, or receive any toy, look-alike, or imitation firearm (""device"") covered by this part as set forth in [§1150.1](http://law.justia.com/cfr/title15/15-3.1.3.7.1.html#15:3.1.3.7.1.0.33.1) of this part unless such device contains, or has affixed to it, one of the markings set forth in [§1150.3](http://law.justia.com/cfr/title15/15-3.1.3.7.1.html#15:3.1.3.7.1.0.33.3) of this part, or unless this prohibition has been waived by [§1150.4](http://law.justia.com/cfr/title15/15-3.1.3.7.1.html#15:3.1.3.7.1.0.33.4) of this part.

[Source](http://law.justia.com/cfr/title15/15-3.1.3.7.1.html)

On a federal level, the orange tip can be legally removed once in private possession. The tip is ONLY required for importation, sale, and transport.

Now, on the state/local level, things change a bit. Depending on your local laws, you may be required to keep the orange tip on when not in your place of residence or a designated airsoft facility/field. A quick google search can let you know what your local laws are.

This information is based on US law, and applies to Canada as well (so far as I can understand). I won't delve into UK and other countries' laws, as that's another headache for another day.

So, in short, feel free to remove your orange tip. But if you're looking to sell your gun, you'd better have held on to that orange tip, or find a replacement.

I hope this can help answer some questions, and I will be willing to answer any that you may have. Also, if anyone has anything to add, I'll be glad to hear it!

In the list below, you will find some chinese airsoft retailers and my experience with them. There are some shops I haven't tried but am aware of. Please note, I have not purchased any replicas from these sites because I see too much risk in it. On to the list.

================================

[Airsoft Park](www.airsoftpark.com) - One of my favorite places to order from. This store has a large selection of popular gear and it's typically in stock. Prices are a bit high but the incredible staff and free shipping make up for it. 3 orders with them and they have all been very pleasant.

[WarIdiot](http://www.waridiot.com/) - I've placed one order with these guys. Free shipping and fair prices. Large selection on parts for GBBs and AEGs. Had a good experience and found out they are also known as [AsiaAirsoft](http://www.asiaairsoft.com/) which also offers free shipping and a large selection of different items. Like the WarIdiot order, AsiaAirsoft pulled through with good service and quality goods.

[GreenBase Trading Co](http://greenbase.hk/) - This has to be my favorite site to browse. Enormous collection of items at incredible prices. Prices are lowered when you register as a member and discounted prices for larger orders. No free shipping and it's a punch in the dick when you see the bill. Spent $500+ on gear and parts and paid ~$100 in shipping. Before I placed the order, some replica optics had trademarks and had a bad feeling about them entering customs. Luckily they use DHL and the delivery was very quick, about a week. Had a great experience with them. If you end up using GreenBase to order gear, order with a friend or two and take advantage of their pricing system.

[Airsoft-Club](http://airsoft-club.com/shop/) - Never used them though they seem like a legit shop. I've browsed their inventory a dozen times and it get's updated and new things are added.

[eHobbyAsia](http://shop.ehobbyasia.com/) - Very well known oversea retailer and has been around for years. Never ordered from them but have talked to staff and they were nice people. No free shipping.

1356095542.0,44,self.airsoft,1584ci,My Customized Gear and Air Rig for Polar Stars,51,7,43,http://www.reddit.com/r/airsoft/comments/1584ci/my_customized_gear_and_air_rig_for_polar_stars/,"[Album here](http://imgur.com/a/Sbrk3). (I turned into a pillow for this photoshoot.)


A natural tradeoff for a Fusion Engine user is finding a place where to put the tank. Its pretty standard to see tanks HPA in backpacks, but after a couple of times of playing with a tank in my MAP pack, I found that I didn't like it. The weight displacement was terrible. Playing with a new gear setup allows you to see what works and what doesn't. It was time to remodel my rig.


My goal was something lightweight, small, holds all the gear I need (No need for a pistol), looks tacticool, and unlike my other rigs of the past --  let me shoulder a gun comfortably.


I went against light Plate Carriers like the JPC and the Banshee because I wanted a full range of motion and not be limited as to how I shoulder my gun. Chest rigs like the LBT 1961a's were considered, but ultimately too much for what I needed it to do.


This rig was my first big step into the world of quality gear. Coming from Condor gear, I learned my lesson and I was not going to half-ass things this time. Pictured in the album is the latest revision of my rig, which I am very fond of. After about a year of development, this is where it stands.


Most of the gear is real, the repro stuff either could not be found in the RS world, or was too costly. In either case, the repro stuff is of a MUCH higher quality than your standard ACM gear. I drew the line at a $50 MC Eagle Double Dual M4/M16 mag pouch. I would need two, and an MBITR pouch of the same price. Not going to happen. I am happy to say that the only Condor on my gear is a blood type patch.


I don't need a pistol. It's nice to have, but its just another thing to take care of and I've hardly ever needed them. By the time I would use it, I would be screwed anyway, so I would rather take the extra space a pistol would take and focus it on my primary so that I wouldn't need a pistol in the first place.


I also do not need a dump pouch. Clever reloading techniques nullify the need for one.


I'm not trigger happy, so I definitely do not need any more than 6 mags to last me quite a few games.


The pouches also allow to place 2 MP5 mags in each slot, whenever I decide to use it instead of my 416. This may become an issue however, once I acquire different types of guns. When it comes to that, I may get HSGI TACOs in the future. I'll figure something out.


Nearly everything in this loadout was customized to my liking, making for a very effective and consequently unique loadout.


------


The Ingredients:


* OSOE Micro Chest Rig - 8 Columns, Slick


* 2 Flyye Dual Double M4/M16 Mag Pouches


* HSGI Leg Rig with 2 M4 Fastmags (Not Pictured)


* Another HSGI Leg Rig


* Flyye MBITR Pouch


* ICOM F4S


* U94 Nexus PTT


* Tons of spare nylon straps and Velcro


Modifications:


* Hidden strap clips on the front of the chest rig, this allows you to shoulder a gun with just about nothing in the way between the stock and your shoulder.


* Custom mount for the VIP Strobe, provides a secure platform that doesn't slide around.


* Custom PTT and hydration tube mount, doesn't slide around.


* Folding the lids of the mag pouches inwards so as to provide a secure place to hold a magazine without it falling out.


* Custom mount for a Velcro name tape


* Laid Velcro down to keep the main pouch in the rig easily accessible, for dead rags and the like. Edit: To clarify, I added velcro to the already existing velcro on the inside, keeping the pouch permanently open. The rig lays so flat that this is not an issue.


* Modified HSGI Leg Rig (detailed below)


* The Air Rig assembly (detailed below)


[The Air Rig](http://i.imgur.com/jGcUCh.jpg):


This came about though some dumb luck and my persistence to not get rid of my 47ci 3000psi steel tank. I love my fusion engines, but I needed to find a comfortable solution for my tank. Larger tanks like those made of carbon fiber I found too big to wear, and the smaller versions were just too fat and expensive. I considered building a triple tank rig using three 8ci tanks, but I scrapped the idea due to it being too much of a hassle for the insane price tag I would have been.


Just looking through gear on eHobby, I stumbled upon a water bottle pouch, thanks to eHobby's shitty search functions. (Because apparently a search for mag pouches also includes water carriers. This worked in my favor, so I'm not even mad. Leave it like this, eHobby.) Anyway, this pouch caught my eye, so I took a look at its dimensions, very helpfully provided by eHobby. The pouch matched up my tank almost exactly.


I decided I would mount my tank horizontally, so I would have space on my back without looking like a scuba diver. This would bring about another issue: How could I now mount my regulator? I decided to not be worthless, so I drew up some possible designs, and a trip to the hardware store later, I had the elbows I needed to pull this off. I ended up with [this](http://i.imgur.com/UbCixh.jpg).


One issue I predicted was the tank rotating in place, so it was wrapped with non-slip padding for cabinets and slowly slid, millimeter by millimeter in the pouch over the course of half an hour. No more sliding, but is it ever coming out again? Who knows, haha. Doesn't matter right now.


Finding a place to put my tank was nice and all, but without a backpack, where was I to put my hydration system? I only had a tall bladder, and I didn't like the options LBT or Tactical Tailor had for hydration. I thought, ""lets fold this hydration bladder in half, and use a square-ish pouch to mount inside."" Luckily enough, I found the most perfect pouch for this job: the ""Spec-Ops Square Utility Pouch"", by Pantac.


This new combination of hardware was mounted via MALICE clips to another HSGI leg rig. This leg rig was modded so that it could instead serve as MOLLE real-estate on my back. It is also easily detachable so you can refill your tank or hydration.


This combination of air rig and hydration solves multiple problems, and to top it off, it is extremely comfortable. I don't notice the tank on me.


Ingredients:


* Guerrilla Air 47ci 3000psi Tank


* Flyye Water Bottle Pouch


* Amped Airsoft Regulator


* 1/4"" Elbows from Hardware Store


* Ninja Paintball Coil Hose w/ Slide Check


* Full Clip Paintball Air Line Cover


* Two short MALICE clips


Luxury, AKA stuff that makes the look:


This is the stuff I wouldn't buy at full price, but if the opportunity presented itself, I would buy them at a very discounted price because why the hell not?


* Name tape


* Milspec Monkey Mini US Flag, because 'MURICA


* Condor Blood Type Patch


* Custom Callsign Patch (Mostly experimental, threw it on for shits n' giggles)


* 2 Chemlights


* Dummy VIP Strobe


* Dummy Smoke Grenade (Not Pictured)

------

When I was looking for a new loadout, I looked though *countless* pages of multiple forums from all over the world of different ""factions"" and playstyles to get inspiration and ideas. Ultimately, gathering inspiration from thousands of pictures and a couple of games and impressions, I came up with this. I'm posting mine as a result from all those findings to inspire others who are also looking to build a new loadout or air rig. Maybe it can work for someone else too.



All of this comes together to make the most comfortable and effective rig I've ever built.



TL;DR: **Item's names do not limit their functions.** Do not be afraid to modify your gear.

I'm currently building a web app to more easily buy a load out of a gun and maybe other gear as well. I am going for something like Pimp My Gun that is a visual designer and is able to pull prices (for example lowest prices on AirsoftGI, Amazon and Google Shopping etc.), reviews/ratings and compatibility info on the fly as you build your AEG.

I need suggestions though as to what features I should include that I haven't thought of. Is the extreme graphic customizability of Pimp My Gun something you guys value? Or are regular product images ""arranged"" as if they were put on a gun OK?

What other pertinent info do you guys think should be on there that you guys consider when buying a AEG or airsoft gear? Should I build a FPS and gun stats database? Currently in the works is a general compatibility database (i.e. this mag works for this model/manufacturer  gun).

Also, this might be difficult to implement but if people think itd be a killer feature, I'd be putting in a feature where you can put in your google wallet, amazon account or Airsoft GI account info and have your load out automatically ordered and put in your cart for easy check out on the respective vendor sites.

PM me or post your comments here for suggestions on how I can make a helpful tool for the airsoft community.

Thanks

So... I have be popping in and out, checking threads and all that, and something has come to my attention that has been bothering me of recent.

DMRs.

Look a DMR and a Sniper Rifle are two rifles that have been upgraded to the point that they shoot very far in comparison to their stock counterparts.

DMRs/Sniper Rifles are not:

* Non-upgraded rifles of any kind  (that's a RIFLE)

* A rifle that shoots very hard without range (that's not *needed* in DMRs!)

* Something that everyone should have.

Every post with DMR in the title is someone who has a long rifle that shoots okay, with not much inside it. Same with Sniper Rifle posts.. they are rifles with nothing upgraded and just look cool.

I love DMRs, I've owned 3, and I love Sniper Rifles, I've owned 4 of those. When I see DMR and Sniper Rifles in the title, I would LOVE to see someones beautiful creation that I can congratulate the person on. NOT some rifle that needs upgrade

&gt;Sidenote.

* Any rifle can be a DMR.. that does not mean every rifle SHOULD be a DMR.

For example, my friend Skywalker: http://s10.postimg.org/i9ckei2cp/2013_05_20_22_33_32.jpg

Pushing 400 fps with at least 285 feet of range (ER-Hop baby!) and you cannot hear it within 10 feet of it thanks to internal foam.

* Some rifles have better range and internals than others, but they are still not DMR class!

A&amp;K SR25s are cute, and they're internals are *ok* but some parts will still have to be swapped for durability. Plus the larger mags are just a pain in the ASS. Having owned an G&amp;G M14 DMR, those mags we HORRIBLE to find..

* To make a DMR or Sniper Rifle, you need skills, TLC, some DIY mods, and money for parts. That is how you make beasts that are well known on the field. However, you CAN make a DMR class weapon for an M4 or a L96 for all of 200$.

M4s are easily the most versatile weapon on the market with the most aftermarket abilities. Swapping a few correct parts and a new hopup and you can have a monster. My best DMR was a JG M16 that only had the motor, spring, spring guide, piston, wiring, and ER-Hop. A good tech also helps (Star_Folder) who put all of this together using extra parts lying around the house. To this day he still says that is one of the straightest shooting guns he has built.

It didnt turn out that bad surprisinglly. *still a work in progress*

Base Model was a boneyaeded JG TCW, got it up to par, never got around to Building the gearbox to a Race-car Spec. but atm 22 bps, 394 FPS. The Springer pictured is for looks, I use a Stubby grip as a handstop. 

Over an M4, this is 3 inches longer, Dosent need a Riser rail to get a good cheek weld with a Paintball mask, and at the same time can be used without a mask and still have a great sight radius. Externally it's FAR from finished, but Going for a more Tactical job then this and leaning more to a Bravo CPW-esque build more then just because i like setting forums on fire... 

And... lastly.

I'm here to tell you if anyone has any questions or would like for me to design a part, I'm the one to go to on this subreddit. 

I have access to both a high quality 3D printer (Dimension BST 768), Solidworks 2011, 2012, and 2013 beta on my home pc. [If i can get it working also a decent quality laser cutter/engraver]

If you know how to CAD feel free to send me a part file and a kind request with a few bucks for shipping and I'll make you any part. Small parts could be made for $1-2 and larger parts more expensive.

If you want me to Design a part for you that i don't have easy access to. I would ask you to either send me the part in your possession, or the whole gun.

I made the stupid mistake of using bbs which has spilled out of my bb-bag on the prep table at a game arena. I didn't realize they were dirty bbs until after a quick game of speed-ball when I noticed the bbs in my speed-loader were all gunked up with stuff. By the time I realized, it was too late, the damage had been done. 

From 270 fps, I dropped to a measly 90 fps.

Dirty BB jams in hop-up. Compression jam leads to a compression hang of the piston within the gearbox, causing the gear and piston to mis-time and eventually leading to piston stripping.

I had my [A&amp;K SVD with the scope and a second mag](http://i.imgur.com/WyhU7h.jpg) and they gave all the squad leaders and snipers [synchronized pocket watches](http://i.imgur.com/8jdLQ.jpg) to signal and time with. Before the game started, we saw the other team during the briefing. I was holding on to my SVD and saw a gun with a gas G22. He and I nodded at each other, seeing the other eyeing the rifles.

We started the day's games, and after the first two, a trend had developed. I was widely considered ""Enemy #1"" by the opposing team for having an incredibly accurate and quiet rifle, and also the ability to escape from almost every situation and just disappear to start dropping targets on another part of the fields. The guy with the G22 did the same, and even better than I did. After the games I learned that he had been asked by his team to hunt me down each game and kill me. My team didn't ask me to do that, but I took it on as a personal goal.

The day wore on, neither of us killed the other. We shot and missed, saw each other and nodded, then slunk off to try again later.

10 minutes into the last game, I was signaling with my watch, when it was torn out of my hand. I dropped, pulled my TM Sig226, and looked around. About 15 or so meters away, I saw the guy with the G22. He had me dead to rights, but merely nodded and disappeared. I grabbed the watch and realized that he was a [better shot than I thought](http://i.imgur.com/pTc3h.jpg).

The game went on for another half hour I think. During our final push, I finally saw him and shot him. He scanned and found me, smiled and left the field. I found him afterwards and after we chatted for a bit, asked why he didn't shoot me when he shot my watch. He replied: ""Because it was more challenging to hit that, and I would have called it a cheap kill. I like to know people can at least shoot back if they see me first."" With that, he walked off and I haven't seen him since.

He should have shot me, but that watch is one badass souvenir.

First we have an A&amp;K LR300 long. As with all A&amp;Ks, the external metal quality is pretty great. But, the hop up is pretty much useless. Got it from a Mystery Box.

Next is an Echo 1 M28 with a cool paint job. I bought it off /u/felixthegreat47 broken for a great price, and fixed it up with a ""Rangers Customs"" piston, S trigger, and spring guide. It was a fun experience that involved much pain.

After that is my beloved Daytona Gun MP5A4. HPA powered, full steel internals, a heavy recoil weight, and yes, it loves to be HK-slapped.

Finally is a gun haven't really shown here. A JAC AR-15 from the late 80s. These guns use the bullet valve system, which is about as simple as it gets.

It has seen a lot of action, and its receiver has the cracks to show it. I plan on fixing it up ASAP.

2 impulse buys here. A WE Hi-Capa Dragon from /u/comandobee and a KZ75 from /u/greatwatermelon.

I'm a sucker for the Cz75 design, and the KZ75 just happens to shoot great.

The Hi-Capa was bought more for something to play with. I love race guns, and the split slide looks really cool. Haven't shot it once.

In the last year I have accumulated the following.

I'm from the UK so licencing and trades will be different to their US counterparts. They are in the order that I purchased them

[KWA SR16](http://imgur.com/CXfPPwC) - First gun after getting back into the hobby. Has a PTS AFG2 on the front, some generic rail covers, MAG magwell grip and a clone 551. Flip up sites are the ones that come with the gun as standard. This is currently shooting way to hot for UK sites so is used as a single shot, DMR weapon. The UK version of this is distributed by ASG and has full LMT trades. Purchased with 5 Lonex flash mags

[KWA USP .45 Match](http://imgur.com/t41ZZ7Y) - Next up I needed a sidearm as if you take a gun hit at our site, the gun is out of action till you respawn. Bought this thinking it would be slightly smaller than it is. It is Desert Eagle sized, absolutly massive gun but fits nicely in my large hands. Picked this up with 2 extra mags. Had real difficulty finding a holster that would fit it that isn't a drop leg so I bought...

[KWA Glock 19](http://imgur.com/kFJbVpP) - I used to own a KJW Glock 19 before selling all my kit to go to Uni, they are a good sized backup. Purchased with 2 extra mags and a Bolle molle hoster so it goes on my vest

After buying the M16 and mags etc, I was firmly in that family of guns so my next purchases needed to use the same mags. Wanting a smaller gun I bought a 

[KWA LMT Defender Patrol Carbine](http://imgur.com/QKF2IfU) - Not entirely sure what the actually KWA name for this is but they are sold under that name in the UK. It's a CQB length M4. Wanting something more tacticool, I Magpul'd the hell out of the gun. MOE Front Hand guard, MOW Pistol Grip, MOE Stock, AFG on the MOE rails. Added a Madbul tight bore that was longer than the gun so it runs completely through the silencer. G&amp;P T1 sits on top, really like this style of sight

At this point I also wanted to switch out to midcaps instead of running just highs. Picked up 6 120 P-Mags and added ranger plates for more tacticool points. After this, I wanted something a little different, something you don't see every day.

[G&amp;P Stoner 63](http://imgur.com/TllaMyc) - I've always wanted a LMG but could never man up about carrying the weight all day. Then I spotted G&amp;P's Stoner 63, it's a halfway house between full on support gun and assault rifle. 1200 round box mag that auto winds with the trigger. I've fitted a Noveske noise amplifier on the front. I want to strip the trades off it to fit in more with the era of the gun. The rate of fire and noise the gun makes is superb, a true terror weapon. I run this with a behemoth of a battery, a 9.6v 4600mah


[G&amp;P Viper Long](http://imgur.com/hHvSt8w) - My latest gun, built for Land Warrior Airsoft by G&amp;P, I've only skirmished with it once and it was beautiful. M4 base with Danial Defence front rail. VOLTOR flash hider, upper and lower reciever and stock. Clubfoot pistol grip, G&amp;P rail covers and Aimpoint finish it off. Running this with my PMAGs and it shoots 348-350 every shot, 350 being our site limit.

My proposed design kind of looks like [this.](http://image.made-in-china.com/2f0j00RCAtdGehrFqD/Emergency-Water-Bag-With-Nozzle.jpg) You could still have the resealable zipper on top with the nozzle on side.

-Pantac Battle Belt with Blackhawk Serpa, 2 Pistol pouches, 2 flash bang pouch (Fits XM204's), and a dump pouch

I'm going to play airsoft tomorrow for the first time since the end of October. This is the longest break I've had from airsoft in the past 28 months, in which I've made a minimum of 1 game per month. I will be going to CQB City, which is a 48,000ft² indoor airsoft field composed mostly of hard cover and a few small bits of soft cover. I will have hydration at spawn, which I should be visiting every 1-10 minutes.

This will also be the first game where I will be taking out my new toy, the M203 launcher with the five pictured grenades. I built the launcher onto the upper as the 3rd distinct upper for my M4, which I built from the ground up. Four of the grenades pictured are CO2 capable, and can run at 800psi, which makes for insane range (100ft on a flat flight with 0.28's), actual felt recoil (from a 8lb rifle), and quite an intimidating sound. (The four Co2 grenades will range across more than half of the field) The fifth grenade is an old school Mosquito Molds 8mm shell, holds 54 BB's and they FLY like no other out the barrel. Has serious range and a good bounce to the BB;s for ricochets. 

So what do you guys all think? Good to go, or do you feel like the M203 launcher wont perform? I personally thing it will do well and surprise a lot of people, since these shower shells have more than double the effective range of most shells you can buy.

I was at the chrono station to get all my guns chronoed. After tagging all of my guns, the last one is my polar star PR-15. The ref asks says ""Let me guess, 400 here and 550 out on the field?"" before he tested the gun. I replied ""Nope, 350 constant"".

I pride myself on being a very honorable player and make sure members on my team are playing honorably as well, so I took a little offense to this.

I've heard that they are also banned on some fields down in Los Angeles, CA

So /r/airsoft, is this the whole ""If he has a gun, he's a criminal"" thing? Because that's what it feels like.

Pistol: WE Glock 17

Sight: Swiss Arms Aimpoint

Foregrip: Magpul Vertical Forgrip


Got this last week, so I thought I'd let you guys know how I'm going on with it.

I bought it because I mainly play CQB and wanted to spice things up a little bit and it turns out it's a quality piece of kit, worth every penny (Got it for £99 in the UK from PatrolBase.co.uk). The kit makes my pistol sound like a beast, and increases the crack of the gas a hell of a lot, you can hear it from one side of our site to the other and strikes fear into people. Easy to install as well, takes about two minutes to add / remove the Glock, needing the removal of just two pins!

First thing I want to say is how well it affects your personal accuracy. I ran the Glock as my main and had really good results with it thinking I was a good shot, but as soon as I got the kit on I realised just how much of a poor pistol shooter I actually was!

I've made some changes to the kit itself, such as swopping the flip down foregrip for a nicer feeling vertical one. My problem was that the grip was a curved, backless, shape which felt weird to hold. Although the stock grip was defiantly sturdy (if not a bit hard to pull down) it just didn't feel right for me. I'm also looking into buying an extended barrel for the Glock itself to boost the FPS of the pistol (Currently 240 in English weather, but was up to 320 in the 32c we've been having these last two weeks), only thing to watch is when the barrel cocks up is if it catches in the outer barrel of the kit.

One of the problems for me with this piece of kit is that I run with an s-10 gas mask to protect my beautiful face, so in order to be able to use the sight I needed to use my raised Aimpoint from my m4. Due to the distance between the upper rail and the barrel of the pistol it means that I can’t sight the gun up to point at 25 yards, I've had to lower the dot as much as possible, and put the hop fully on. Minor problem to be fair, if you aim for the head, you're going to at least hit the chest.

Another problem for the gun is because of the way it’s a screw-less release system, at the back of the gun underneath where the charging handle sits there is a gap which cannot be closed unless held together with tape or glue. This changes the sound of the gun, but has no effect on the use, other than slight wobble if you pull the grip to the right. I'm looking at modding it but drilling a hole right through and placing a bolt in.

As I say, really nice piece of kit, though wouldn't recommend it outdoors with a stock pistol, but indoors this thing is a beast!

Kinda new around here, but I just recently bought a new AEG, with the intentions of getting more range out of it than my previous JG M4 S-System. I bought a Airsoft GI FMG4 SPEC-V, and I love it so far!

(EDIT: Yes I know it's *another* M4, sue me. :P I wanted a VTAC rail)

Like I said, I needed something with a bit more range, and this ended up being a great choice. So far, I've installed a Madbull 6.03 509mm barrel, and a Maple Leaf 75 degree bucking. The weapon is still fairly new; only 5-6 mags through it, so the new bucking may still be breaking in, but currently I'm able to hit man-sized targets within 180 feet in several shots on semi quite easily. The range tops out around ~200 feet, with shots becoming harder on semi, but still do-able on auto. Shooting an estimated (New bucking, FPS readings were fluctuating) ~350 FPS with .28's at 16 RPS on a 9.6 1600mah

This is not meant to be a ""DMR"" (I know how you guys are... ;D) but I may plan on mounting an optic some time down the road.

Now before you hate on this, let me tell you HOW i teach them.

Step 1: Stand the student between a wall and 5 targets

Step 2: Tell the student to shoot the targets then find cover

Step 3: Open fire on the student after 20 seconds

Step 3.5: if student was hit or did not find proper cover, simply tell them what they did wrong and then suggest something different.

Step 4: Have the student shoot at you while your behind cover.

Step 5: Return Fire and see if student finds proper cover.

Step 6: Have Student retrieve an objective while under fire.

Step 6.5: If student fails 5 or 6, simply swap places so that the student may see from your angle what he did wrong.

Step 7: Bring the student to a local airsoft field and have him/her on your squad.

Step 8: ensure student is effective on the field with you.

Step 9: Congratulate student on being good at airsoft, and let them be free.

Step 10: Profit (its non-profit) in the fact that you helped someone who wasn't confident in their ability become confident.


Secretly, its not as much 'training' them as it is letting them figure out how airsoft really works.  So far ive helped 7 people and its worked pretty damn well...

Daytona's and P*'s,44,9,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/airsoft/comments/143xmc/very_detailed_comparison_between_hpa_guns_and/,"Hey, on another from called ""Mid west airsofters"" I saw ""Mongoose"" one of the main ref's and player for MAG from CAA put up a post, saying he was going to get his second or third gun ""Daytona'd"". So i asked him...      ""How do you find a Daytona, money and maintenance wise compared to an AEG? With the External tanks, are they a definite pro or con over a standard battery and gearbox? And lastly, Daytona Vs Polar star. 
Just things I've always wanted to ask a user...""                      
**The response i got was one of the best comparisons I've ever seen. Anyone who has ever wondered, like myself, should take the time to read this. The reason I'm posting it on here is just so more people can see it, as it was posted on such a small form.** So without further to do here it is.  
                             
First and foremost I will tell you that I personally prefer the HPA system over traditional AEG's, spring powered guns, and gas in mag guns. As a matter of fact, I just sold my last AEG so I could fund my DaytonaGun FAL.       
        
People who are against P* and DaytonaGun will give you three chief complaints; money, running an external air rig, and changing velocity. 
          
1. Money       
Yes. These systems will be more expensive than your traditional AEG. People will look at the cost of the weapons system coupled with the need for a tank and a regulator and are intimidated. I bought my set ups in pieces. First the gun, then later the tanks and regulators. Now that I have air tanks and regulators, the cost of each additional HPA powered weapon that I buy drops because I already have tanks and regulators. The great thing about these systems is the lack of a need for upgrading internals. The only thing that may need to be changed is the barrel and hop up. But you would do that on an AEG too wouldn't you? Other than that, these systems are field ready out of the box. No need to check compression, no need to buy new gears or a mosfet or a new motor or worry if my battery is powerful enough to run the motor. Looking at overall cost, an AEG may have a lower start up cost, but in the long run I still feel that these systems are worth it. The only maintenance required is to hit it with some silicone lubricaton every once in a while.      
      
2. External Air Rig      
Some players feel that the need for an external air source is the limiting factor in deciding against these systems. Some players think that it's unrealstic for an air line to be coming out of the gun. It comes down to preference. I run my airline through my load bearing gear so that it is difficult to see. And I put my tank in a back pack. The air line is relatively difficult to spot and I am not limited to shooting only right or left handed. With enough line, you can easily switch which shoulder you shoot with. I can also quiclkly disconnect my airline via QD fittings should I ever need to ditch my gun. You can also purchase hose cover to make your airline blend in with your gear even more. Here of some pictures of my running an HPA weapon and as you can see, the airline is difficult to spot.        
[pictures](http://imgur.com/a/fZF9G)      
      
I will also mention that filling an air tank is alot easier than charging a battery. If someone's battery dies at a game, it will take some time to get that battery back up and running. An air tank is filled in seconds and is good for thousands of rounds. As far as traveling to events that may not have an air compressor on hand to refill your tanks, you have a few options. The first is to have the tank filled before you leave to attend such an event. In addition, with the increase in popularity of the P* fusion engine, retailers that sponsor these guns often bring an air compressor so that these users can fill their tanks. Great examples are Operations Northern Light, Irene and Faded Giant. While the facilities for these events did not have fill stations on hand, the sponsors (Amped Airsoft, Polar Star) brought an air compressor with them so that HPA users could fill their air all weekend long.      
      
2a. HPA vs GIM (Gas in mag)
Some players will argue that you get more realism out of a Gas in Mag weapon. Yes that's probably true; the mags hold less rounds and the gun does kick to a degree. But I have yet to find a gas in mag system that does not suffer from that same short comings that all GIM guns suffer from. Variable performance based on temperature is my biggest complaint as they don't function well in cold weather. The external air rig negates this as the air flowing into the system is the same everytime. My velocity won't drop because it is cold out. And it won't go up because it is warm out. I can adjust my velocity where I want it to be via my external rig and then lock it using an approved tournament lock. In addition, if you compare the kick of a gas in mag system vs a DaytonaGun, the DG blows it out of the water.       
      
3. Changing velocity
Some players have complained that it's just too easy to change the velocity on these systems. It is a fact that it is relatively easy to change the velocity, especially if you are running a secondary regulator. The way to keep players who may want to turn up their velocity in check is to enforce the use of a tournament lock. This lock will prevent the player from turning their velocity up. At various games, I have seen various ways of policing the HPA systems. For example, at Irene this past year, They would put a sticker on your weapon that said what pressure you were running and what the gun chronoed at. I showed them my tournament lock and they told me it was not needed. as staff would be spot checking guns in the field. To me, this is not a good way to police the HPA users out there. I personally was not spot checked all weekend, nor did I see anyone being spot checked. This is why MAG requires a tournament lock for HPA users at all of its games. In addition, many AEGs these days have quick spring change features. Who is to stop a player from heading to the safe zone and quickly swapping a spring for more velocity? In the same vein, spot checks must be done to keep everyone safe.       
      
4. Maintenance. 
You asked about maintenance for these systems. I touched on this a little bit before. These guns are relativity maintenance free. The DaytonaGuns require a silicon lubrication once over every once in a while. For the P* system, it is recommended to disassemble and lubricate the O-Rings for every three games that you play, although I don't know anyone who does this religiously.  The DG's are based on what is known as ""classic"" airsoft designs. If you look into classic airsoft weapons, you will find that they stopped being manufactured in the 1990's. Most of them are still running today (if you can find them ) and they haven't been made in 20 years. In addition, the sole distributor for DG in the US is based right here in Illinois. Should an issue ever arise, you can always contact him.       
      
5. P* vs DG
This really comes down to preference. I have both systems and have run with both extensively. The P* offers more end use customization due to the addition of a computerized Fire Control Unit FCU. You can adjust settings like ROF, how long your poppet valve stays open, how long your air nozzle stays back to allow slower feeding magazines to work, etc. DG offers an unparalleled kick back. Many have said that it recoils more than a 22 rifle. There is also much satisfaction to be had when firing due to the crisp sound and movement of the bolt. Even racking the gun is quite satisfying. Couple this with the fact that there aren't that many DG users out there when compared to P* and you have a case to get one.       
      
Overall it comes down to personal preference. Can you build an AEG that will have similar performance to a DG or P*? Yes. Do DG and P* cost more? Yes. Is it worth it to me to run these systems? Yes. Are these systems for everyone? No.       
      
I hope I answered all of your questions :) (yes he did)

But I figured you guys would like it.

 This group that I used to play with was doing a weekend long event, and at the end of the first day we where doing a night time game of capture the flag. I was wearing a ghillies suit and packing a bolt action sniper. I was practically invisible in the dark. I flanked their entire team and belly crawled right into their base. I was laying in the grass thinking about how to go about my next move. I could hear enemies all around me talking, whenever someone moved back to there base I heard then whisper ""duct"" then the person approaching would say ""tape"". I realized what I had just learned, there code word for identifying friendlies. So I took note of as many camper positions as I could, then proceeded to get mowed down by a wave of guys returning from spawn.

So I go to respawn, waiting the five or so minutes. While in the spawn area I strip off the ghillies suit and swap out for my M4. Then proceed to walk directly towards the enemy flag. I casually walk up, weapon lower and whisper ""duct"" and get a ""tape"" from several places in the grass scattered around there base. I walk up and sit beside an enemy who is leaning on a fence watching the flag. I then have a five minute conversation with him, feeding him false intel about my teams movements and defence. Another guy walks up and sits next to us to rest. I take a good look around and there is only one or two other guys in the base. I stood up without saying a word and walk ten paces. I looked at the two guys I had being chatting with and said; ""Hey guys, I think I smell a rat"" I then mercilessly gunned them down ""SURPRISE MOTHER FUCKERS!!!"" I had to quickly turn and dispatch the other guy before he realized what was going on. Then I ran and stole there flag.

1371362233.0,34,self.airsoft,1gfwyj,I still have active wholesale accounts and can get guns for cheaper to you guys.,53,19,123,http://www.reddit.com/r/airsoft/comments/1gfwyj/i_still_have_active_wholesale_accounts_and_can/,"As many of you know I used to run a business. Well Machinima offered me a job years ago so I took that job and closed my shop down then. Business isn't exactly a fun job and I was a bit naive in thinking I'd be doing all hobby and no business. How ever, I still have my whole sale accounts open so if I want to get guns cheap I can do that. I receive absolutely no profit from doing this. Now, there is a catch how ever. This is a lot of work doing orders for people and I'm really not interested in getting back into business. How ever, I am not sponsored on my airsoft channel which means every thing I do on my Jarek4 account comes from my own pocket. This is very expensive and just isn't a realistic thing to do for me. How ever, if you were to order through me and give me the okay to make some videos on it that would solve that issue. I don't skirmish with these. I basically take them out of the box and do in depth quality checks for my videos. Essentially more quality control. Once the videos are done I clean the products up and they go back in the box and shipped to the rightful owner. I've done this a few times for subscribers in the past with their generosity.

TL;DR version. I can get guns for $20-50 or so cheaper than retail price for you guys. Price reduction varies on product obviously. I can make videos of said product and keep my channel alive as well as checking to make sure the gun works as promised. I receive no profit from the gun purchased through me (usually I lose money on shipping doing this) and only receive money from machinima for the videos. Both parties win.

[Click here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTrhh6a0d00) if you want an example of what exactly I do in reviews. If you haven't seen my videos in a long time I'd recommend looking at it as I've really put a lot of effort into improving and my videos are quite different now. 

Thank you for your consideration. I'm looking at ways to improve the community. I think being able to get things for cheaper is a good start.

EDIT: Wholesaler names include spartan imports, tsd, evike (Yes evike. They're actually a fairly large wholesaler as well as regular retailer now), and ukarms. If it's on Evike I can get it for cheaper. Very few exceptions. Keep in mind I work at night. I won't be replying around the times of 5am-4pm. 

DOUBLE EDIT: If you want a price check please provide a link to the gun you are referring to. Preferably on Evike. It just makes this easier. 

TRIPLE EDIT: Sorry guys, I'm not looking at picking up any M4s. I'll make exceptions to things like the 417 because that's a little different. I just don't want my channel to become the M4 channel. There's too many of them. Let's think original and get a gun that's unique. Plenty of other guns use M4 mags and parts. Look here. http://www.reddit.com/r/airsoft/comments/1gdy53/list_of_guns_that_are_m4_compatible_but_are_not/

POSSIBLE LAST EDIT: It seems my wholesaler caught on to what I have been doing and has disabled my whole sale accounts. I can still get things but obviously not at that discount. Unless their website is messing up which I wouldn't doubt. If this is true though I'm a bit annoyed. It's not as if they aren't still making money.

The Operation Lion Claws Military Simulation Series began as a way to honor our military and the sport of mil-sim airsoft. These values have remained paramount throughout our twelve year history. We expect that same respect to be shown by our players. Following the rules and playing with honor are the most important things our players do.
Unfortunately, we have a team that refuses to follow even the most basic rules and shows total disrespect for our VIPs, staff, and other players. This teams utter lack of respect towards our military personal and VIPs over the Memorial Day weekend Operations left us no other option but to ban them. We try to work with all of our teams and players. We do not ban teams from our operations without great debate and numerous attempts at intervention.
After repeated violations and warnings, the team known as The Green Mountain Rangers are banned from all OLCMSS functions. All players who have registered under that team name or are associated with them are banned from all OLCMSS functions. Any player who ends their association with said team may appeal to have their ban lifted and be moved to probationary status pending deliberations by our staff.
All other teams or individuals that wish to follow in the footsteps of the Green Mountain Rangers by disrespecting the rules, players, staff, VIPs, and themselves are given notice that we will not tolerate such behavior at our Operations.

Being an easily amused guy with a short attention span spurs me to constantly try new guns. So I felt that change was necessary. 

Left my house with three guns, $140, and ¥6000; here's what I got (told in my usual fashion).

Lets start with my most ""SIGnificant"" purchase:

[A real steel Sig P229 case](http://i.imgur.com/IIrMxkg.jpg)

Pretty cool right? Definitely worth the ¥6000 I paid for it. I am one happy operator.

Oh? You want to see inside? 

[Okay](http://i.imgur.com/ef9xT0v.jpg) you can take a look.


Just a [TM P226R](http://i.imgur.com/TALiqK7.jpg), nothing special. Except it feels kind of heavy and inefficient....could it be?

Yes it has the full steel guarder frame and slide installed (with the necessary internal upgrades). Now I need to track down green gas or KJW CO2 mags.

Came with 3 mags, 2 with high-flow valves, one standard.

How did I get it for only ¥6000? 

Because I paid $140 for 

[This](http://i.imgur.com/ksQ0AWB.jpg)

It's a **Hi** capacity case that can carry a good amount of items.

In fact, its capacity is so *Hi* that it can fit [one of these in it](http://i.imgur.com/7IFoKxK.jpg). 

This is actually a gift for someone's birthday that I am currently converting him to airsoft.

Of course it's a [TM 5.1 with a few custom parts.](http://i.imgur.com/9prK8ew.jpg) But the slide is still plastic, so performance is top-notch.

1367100390.0,39,self.airsoft,1d8lq1,My thoughts on the grand opening for GI Tactical (East Coast),41,2,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/airsoft/comments/1d8lq1/my_thoughts_on_the_grand_opening_for_gi_tactical/,"Today I hit the grand opening for Airsoft GI's new store on the East Coast, GI Tactical. It was about a 1.5 hour drive from my area (Northern VA, the closest field is Airsoft CQB). I came not expecting much, but was blown away. The store opened at 10. I got there at 9:15, and the line was already wrapped around the building! Luckily, I was still able to get the early bird red tickets (for the first 200 people), but did not win anything. A friend of mine, however, won a Condor Plate Carrier from the raffle. I waited about 2.5 hours (including the 45 mins before opening) to get into the store. I did meet some awesome people, including Bob ""The Axe Man"" Hildebrand. There were also outdoor booths from Valken Tactical, Polarstar, Tactical Response Unleashed (the local field), Ballahack Airsoft (location of TvB 4 and 4.5, complete with a physical model of the field!), and a couple others. I picked up a nice polarstar patch for my ACS, and TIL that they're (unofficial estimate) about 1-2 months away from finishing an M249 engine!

They only let 80 people into the store at a time. This reduced the population inside, but at the same time this was stupid because to participate in the raffles (other than the early bird one) you had to stay until 4. 

*First impressions:* 
Wow. It's a pretty large building, and according to the staff, better than the CA location. Very well organized, different companies and items separated. 

*Stuff:*
Massive gun wall with everything from JGs to VFCs. I was able to handle many guns that I'd never thought about, from the VFC HK417 350C, Kriss Vector, ASGI Custom VFC MK17 (SCAR-H), and too many others. If they ran out of rifles in the back stockroom, then they'd pick the display model right off, box it, and sell it to you. 

There's a huge section devoted to tactical gear, ranging from gun bags to packs, to BDU's. A lot of it is taken up by Condor Gear. There's also a Pantac bin, complete with a company representative. 

Flashlights, GBB SMGs, pistols, and sights/scopes were held in glass display cases. Batteries are held in another case, and are bought at checkout.

*Staff/Transactions/Etc:*
The staff were very very friendly, and would do almost anything for you. Unfortunately, with so many customers, they were overwhelmed and service was somewhat slow.

The store was very very chaotic. People were running left and right and took a relatively large amount of time to get service.

The lines to checkout were extremely unorganized (4 in total). It was hard to decipher which was which, and I ended up waiting an 1 hour and 15 to get to the front. I am inclined to believe there were more people waiting to checkout than there were shopping.

*Post-Checkout:*
I ended up buying the last VFC HK416 they had (it was the display one). Took a picture with the Elite Force representative there. I left around 2:30, and there was still a solid line of people waiting. 
I walked out and got a free swag bag. More patches, a draw string bag, a KJW paper portfolio, and a couple more tote bags. 

*TL;DR/Overview:* It was a chaotic opening, but went smoothly. I spent most of my time waiting than actually browsing. The staff were very friendly, but there weren't enough for the opening. I did see and talk to a ton of semi-celebrities from the GiTV videos. They had a huge stock/selection of items, from a massive gun wall to almost half a store of tactical gear. Overall, I'd give them a 9/10. 

If anyone has questions or comments I'll definitely reply when I can. This was a shortened version of my thoughts and experiences.

This is just my little collection. These are all guns I use in the field. I used to have a much more extensive collection but I cut down because they were all just wallhangers.

- KWA CQR MOD 1
- G&amp;G UMG
- WE G17
- A Bat (If all else fails)

I'm currently upgrading the CQR MOD to be somewhat of a DMR. I've already improved air seals and put a type 1 cylinder in. Will be putting in more parts in the future.

The UMG is my CQB gun and performs admirably.

The WE G17 is just too damn cool looking. I had a light on the rail but the battery recently died so I took it off.
I also replaced the outer barrel with a TM one. Looks beautiful.

The bat is if I'm all out. Yup. ",,False,,t5_2qi2x,1365558771.0,,,True,t3_1c16bn,http://www.reddit.com/r/airsoft/comments/1c16bn/my_little_collection/,

Everything except the RPK74m is a WE GBBR. Somehow the Glock got into there. 

The AKs74ns have real plum handguards and pistol grips, as well as real flash hiders, and the AKs74uns have real pistol grips. They've all got the Ra-Tech steel internals as well. 3/4 of them also have the FG airsoft recoil kit, which barely limits the bolt travel but vastly increases the rate of fire.

[Here] (http://www.airsoftgi.com/product_info.php?cPath=139_24_150&amp;products_id=6337) is what I picked out. Unfortunately, I saw that ASGI did not have a secure website (I don't like giving my credit card number to unsecure websites). So I decided to order it by phone. The nice ASGI employee (named Anthony) graciously took my order. He asked me if I already had a battery and charger for it, and I said no, because it went over my budget (I already knew this, and I did have a charger, just not the recommended nunchuck style battery for it). I said that I would order that later. He then told me that the AEG was 15% off, which had not been mentioned on the website. Instead of buying only the gun for $300, I instead got it for $270, including the battery. Plus he said that I would get a free ASGI t-shirt and a free bag of HQ bb's since this was my first order from ASGI. 

So, thank you ASGI, Anthony, and reddit for helping me pick out a great AEG and getting it for less than I thought I would pay.",,False,,t5_2qi2x,False,,,True,t3_15qwv2,http://www.reddit.com/r/airsoft/comments/15qwv2/thanks_asgi/,

When i got into airsoft I bought a Box of awesomeness from evike. It came with a Javelin M4 and some stuff like a sweatshirt and dead rag and other small things (I used the M4 for a while then sold it) Anyways the sweatshirt came up from the back of my closet, almost 2 years later, when going though some old stuff. Picked it up, not remembering what it was at first then I saw the logo on it and it blew my mind. (Picture at the end) Just to think of the days playing with my crap M4 in shorts,(this was a wayyy early javelin 10x worse than now days ;) ) and to find a old sweatshirt with a logo that i would recognize anywhere now. (kind of the clash between my old newb self and a (unheard of to me at the time) ""milsim logo)  Anyways it gave me a reminder that is very important for airsofters as a whole, of every level to realize, everyone started somewhere.
