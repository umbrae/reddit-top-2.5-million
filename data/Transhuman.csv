I work in the VERY small United State's hub (there is only one, and only 3 of us bust our BUTTS to get these hands shipped and fitted correctly nation wide).  

We're a small little family, and LOVE what we do.  We'd be delighted to answer any and all questions about anything having to do with the Bebionic 3 (or previous versions), or anything having to do with Orthotics and Prosthetics.

Sorry in advance if this is something you're not interested in!  Have a great day. 


Edited to say:  If for some reason there are those that are skeptical (or just want to see pictures because they're curious) I would be more than happy to take some photo's/video.

Also KimmoKM the neckbeard/'butthurt dweller' guy stated in an IRC interview that the reason he didn't attempt to improve his health and fitness was because he would simply:
&gt;replace my[his] biological parts with mechanical when the technology advances enough

It seems that many people use transhumanism to excuse their present inaction and in their desire to believe in some great future they are vulnerable to 'techno-cults' which are behave much the same as the predatory religions they so often despise.

For me Transhumanism is about working hard to advance what we have at the moment (and indeed MIRI and SENS are parts of that) whilst using everything at our disposal to maximise our potential whether it is nootropics and tDCS to attempt to increase cognitive ability or nutritional information, supplements and exercise regimens to improve health and fitness.

I believe it is best to lead by example - to demonstrate how knowledge and technology can improve our lives and support others who are doing the same (such as MIRI, SENS, the DIYBio and 3D printing guys and of course all the academic researchers).

I am a volunteer for the SENS foundation. As written in our mission statement, ""the SENS Foundation works to develop, promote and ensure widespread access to rejuvenation biotechnologies which comprehensively address the disabilities and diseases of aging."" Even more concisely, SENS is about: ""transforming the way the world researches and treats age-related disease.""

The new SENS website, like the old one, can be found at www.SENS.org. We hope to provide the public with comprehensive information on what we are doing, what has been done and what goals we have for the future.

The website has a good deal of new content, including a couple of excellent new computer animations. One is featured on the homepage, with the other on the new main research page, which will be at www.SENS.org/research. This section will also be the new home of the SENS Research Foundation's intramural and extramural research pages, which will give a lot of detail on each project that SENS Research Foundation is conducting or funding right now.

While a good deal of our support comes from scientific, corporate and educational entities, to say that public support of our cause is crucial would be an understatement. Many people who have contributed and volunteered for SENS have no background in science, but their enthusiasm is key to help secure wider, mainstream support. You can connect with us at our Facebook page and on our SENS sub-Reddit. Also, please feel free to directly contact the SENS foundation using [this](http://sens.org/contact-us) link.

While I am not involved with any research aspects of SENS, I would be happy to answer any questions you may have about it. If I cannot answer a question, I will make sure to forward it to someone who can. I would also like to take this opportunity to ask for volunteers to help out with SENS mission. You do not have to have a background in science to help out (mine is in business and finance) and many effective volunteers have had no formal education in science save for what they learned in high school.

Finally, I will be posting this on a few similar sub-reddits to this one, so I apologize if this is a re-post for you.

I realize that there are downsides to this as well (its useage in academics for example would definitely qualify as an unfair advantage). But considering the problems the world is having right now, we need smarter people to fix things. What should a nootropic drug focus on? Cognition and memory improvement are definitely must haves.

I've been working on several projects, educating myself on actually performing self-enhancements. I'm currently working on building my own replacement hearing aid, and planning to take it further than conventional hearing aids go. I want to hear MORE than an average person can hear.

Yeah, I need hearing aids to improve myself beyond my capabilities, and one of my pair broke a couple weeks ago. Not a dead battery, but finally the machine giving up the ghost. Given this motivation, I've been researching electronics, taking photos of my molds and started 3D modelling them for us in my self-made 3D printer.

My second project goes into the first. I have glasses, hardly a serious augment, but they bring me to human levels. I want to use my technological knowledge and with my programming skills, electronic skills, and 3D modelling skill design myself a better set of eyes to wear. Ideally I'm just looking for zoom, IR view, and panoramic vision. I'd love to figure out how to actually include a sonar vision and Ultraviolet vision, but that seems to be beyond my capabilities.

I had no idea such visual enhancement was even possible, and that was seven years ago. When we combine this with what is currently possible via steroids, HGH, modafinil and other performance enhancing drugs and nootropics then is current legislation just holding us back?

I mean at the moment supplements are largely unregulated and thus the industry is little better than snake oil salesmen. However, if the laws regarding enhancing substances, both mental and physical, were relaxed but the regulation tightened and people educated about the various risks then surely everyone could strive to achieve more?

Also there are the physical modifications such as the contact lenses mentioned above and the extremely high-tech swimming gear, and the Oscar Pistorius, a runner with prosthesis who is banned from several races due to concerns about 'cheating'. Also in the future there is the possibility of gene therapy and for our descendants, even genetic manipulation prior to birth.

It seems stupid that we apply the same rules about 'cheating' to every sphere of life that are required for the highly artificial environment of competitive sport.

The rules don't even make sense, EPO is banned, but altitude chambers aren't just because one is more 'natural'? The military require you to use stimulants in the special forces and air force, but if you do so in college you are cheating?

It just seems bizarre that we could achieve so much more with the intelligent and informed application of existing technology and yet we act like the Amish and shun the possibility in the most irrational way. This isn't quasi-science fiction about mind uploading and swarms of nanobots, this is stuff we can do now to move beyond 'the indelible stamp of our lowly origin' as Darwin put it, and yet we refuse to?

1327263866.0,42,self.Transhuman,ort4b,Just wrote an article about nootropics for campus newspaper,47,5,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/Transhuman/comments/ort4b/just_wrote_an_article_about_nootropics_for_campus/,"Here it is if anyone is interested--criticism is more than welcome! If I end up happy with it I'm going to submit it to the journal of global health too

Intelligence is the raw material of human achievement. Every distinction between man and animal is the result of our exceptional brains. 

Even though the forces of evolution have not ceased to work on us, for the last 50,000 years the individual human brain has not substantially changed. Our remote hunter-gatherer ancestors were as intelligent individually as we are today. All the landmark achievements of civilization are the work of our collective intelligence. The “hive-mind” is talented in some areas but challenged in others: our weaknesses in long-term planning and morality are indicated by our failures to solve global warming or end genocide and war, respectively. A society of minds informed only by evolutionary signals can never transcend the animal kingdom from which we arose. 

To fulfill our potential and transcend our animal roots it is necessary to further develop our individual minds. The field of cognitive enhancement exists to do just that. 

Imagine the consequences of, for example, a 25 point increase in intelligence worldwide, or even simply among those involved in government. Such a shift would change the course of history in radical ways. What may strike you as science fiction is not far off in scientific terms--the fields of neurology and psychopharmacology are moving quickly and our understanding of the biological infrastructure of intelligence is growing accordingly. 

The statement that people use on average only 10% of their brains has been proven to be a myth, but the fact remains that we are nowhere near the actualization of our full mental potential. Through advancements in medical science we will be able to improve cerebral efficiency and health, and even eventually exceed the brain’s biological limitations. 

The safe and effective “smart drugs” that are our best and nearest bet for sustainable cognitive enhancement are just around the corner. In fact, the first generation has already arrived.

There exist a few options for those looking for a mental boost, starting with caffeine, a minor stimulant. Its effects on focus and wakefulness have made it ubiquitous in western culture. Then there are the psychostimulant drugs such as Ritalin and Adderall prescribed for ADHD and related illnesses. Their effects on alertness and information retention are famous on college campuses for their usefulness as study aids. However, Adderall and its relatives are more productivity enhancers than intelligence enhancers, and their beneficial effects come with the risks of neurotoxicity, heart problems, and addiction.

More promising is the large and diverse class of chemical known as nootropics. The term “nootropic” refers to any substance that improves mental function and is neuroprotective or at the very least entirely nontoxic. To qualify as a nootropic a compound must be effectively free from negative side effects. The original nootropic is Piracetam, first synthesized in 1964. Scientists quickly noticed its beneficial effects on even healthy brains and its spotless safety profile, which has remained intact through over 40 years of study. Its primary effects are a substantial increase in verbal memory and recall, as well as a noticeable gain in the perception of visual and audial contrast. A number of studies support its beneficial effects on subjects with Down Syndrome, dyslexia, and dementia, as well as on simply aged or even perfectly healthy brains (see papers published by the labs of Ennaceur, Wilsher, and Schuer).

Other nootropics include DMAE (dimethylethanolamine) and choline: precursors to the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which is heavily involved in learning and attention. Vinpocetine is a vasodilator which enhances cerebral blood flow and communication between the hemispheres of the brain. Huperzine A increases synaptic levels of acetylcholine and functions as a neuroprotective agent. 
	
Though not technically a nootropic, the stimulant modafinil has been shown to improve focus and wakefulness without serious side effects and with a much lower addiction potential than the ADHD stimulants or coffee. It reduces the need for sleep and can keep users awake for 36 hours without fatigue. Though available to civilians only by way of prescription for narcolepsy and related disorders, modafinil has seen use by the  US Air Force on long missions. Drugs like modafinil may eventually render sleep entirely unnecessary. 

Many other nootropics and miscellaneous “smart drugs” exist in various stages of research, clinical testing, and use--the more we learn about the biological basis of intelligence, the better able we are to deliver focused and safe therapies to enhance it.	

The field of cognitive enhancement is exciting and fast-paced. However, its successes can be misunderstood and its proponents attacked for trying to ‘play God’ or engineer an unfair playing field. The off-label use of psychostimulants in academia is a particularly controversial issue that casts a negative light upon the prospect of scientifically augmented cognition. The debate over the proper societal response will be long and harsh, but the fact remains that cognitive enhancement is possible, effective, and safe, and might be a widespread reality sooner than you think.

The rest of the story can be found at http://hpmor.com, and the following is taken from chapter 39 (http://hpmor.com/chapter/39). I couldn't fit the whole segment on death, so if this sounds interesting, read all of chapter 39 or the whole fanfic.
Enjoy!

""Tell me, Harry,"" said the Headmaster (and now his voice sounded simply puzzled, though there was still a hint of pain in his eyes), ""why do Dark Wizards fear death so greatly?""

""Er,"" said Harry, ""sorry, I've got to back the Dark Wizards on that one.""

""What?"" said Dumbledore.

""Death is bad,"" said Harry, discarding wisdom for the sake of clear communication. ""Very bad. Extremely bad. Being scared of death is like being scared of a great big monster with poisonous fangs. It actually makes a great deal of sense, and does not, in fact, indicate that you have a psychological problem.""

The Headmaster was staring at him as though he'd just turned into a cat.

""Okay,"" said Harry, ""let me put it this way. Do you want to die? Because if so, there's this Muggle thing called a suicide prevention hotline -""

""When it is time,"" the old wizard said quietly. ""Not before. I would never seek to hasten the day, nor seek to refuse it when it comes.""

Harry was frowning sternly. ""That doesn't sound like you have a very strong will to live, Headmaster!""

""Harry..."" The old wizard's voice was starting to sound a little helpless; and he had paced to a spot where his silver beard, unnoticed, had drifted into a crystalline glass goldfish bowl, and was slowly taking on a greenish tinge that crept up the hairs. ""I think I may have not made myself clear. Dark Wizards are not eager to live. They fear death. They do not reach up toward the sun's light, but flee the coming of night into infinitely darker caverns of their own making, without moon or stars. It is not life they desire, but immortality; and they are so driven to grasp at it that they will sacrifice their very souls! Do you want to live forever, Harry?""

""Yes, and so do you,"" said Harry. ""I want to live one more day. Tomorrow I will still want to live one more day. Therefore I want to live forever, proof by induction on the positive integers. If you don't want to die, it means you want to live forever. If you don't want to live forever, it means you want to die. You've got to do one or the other... I'm not getting through here, am I.""

The two cultures stared at each other across a vast gap of incommensurability.

""I have lived a hundred and ten years,"" the old wizard said quietly (taking his beard out of the bowl, and jiggling it to shake out the color). ""I have seen and done a great many things, too many of which I wish I had never seen or done. And yet I do not regret being alive, for watching my students grow is a joy that has not begun to wear on me. But I would not wish to live so long that it does! What would you do with eternity, Harry?""

Harry took a deep breath. ""Meet all the interesting people in the world, read all the good books and then write something even better, celebrate my first grandchild's tenth birthday party on the Moon, celebrate my first great-great-great grandchild's hundredth birthday party around the Rings of Saturn, learn the deepest and final rules of Nature, understand the nature of consciousness, find out why anything exists in the first place, visit other stars, discover aliens, create aliens, rendezvous with everyone for a party on the other side of the Milky Way once we've explored the whole thing, meet up with everyone else who was born on Old Earth to watch the Sun finally go out, and I used to worry about finding a way to escape this universe before it ran out of negentropy but I'm a lot more hopeful now that I've discovered the so-called laws of physics are just optional guidelines.""

""I did not understand much of that,"" said Dumbledore. ""But I must ask if these are things that you truly desire so desperately, or if you only imagine them so as to imagine not being tired, as you run and run from death.""

""Life is not a finite list of things that you check off before you're allowed to die,"" Harry said firmly. ""It's life, you just go on living it. If I'm not doing those things it'll be because I've found something better.""

Dumbledore sighed. His fingers drummed on a clock; as they touched it, the numerals changed to an indecipherable script, and the hands briefly appeared in different positions. ""In the unlikely event that I am permitted to tarry until a hundred and fifty,"" said the old wizard, ""I do not think I would mind. But two hundred years would be entirely too much of a good thing.""

""Yes, well,"" Harry said, his voice a little dry as he thought of his Mum and Dad and their allotted span if Harry didn't do something about it, ""I suspect, Headmaster, that if you came from a culture where people were accustomed to living four hundred years, that dying at two hundred would seem just as tragically premature as dying at, say, eighty."" Harry's voice went hard, on that last word.

""Perhaps,"" the old wizard said peacefully. ""I would not wish to die before my friends, nor live on after they had all gone. The hardest time is when those you loved the most have gone on before you, and yet others still live, for whose sake you must stay..."" Dumbledore's eyes were fixed on Harry, and growing sad. ""Do not mourn me too greatly, Harry, when my time comes; I will be with those I have long missed, on our next great adventure.""

""Oh!"" Harry said in sudden realization. ""You believe in an afterlife. I got the impression wizards didn't have religion?""

************************************************************************************
(skipped a bit)

Dumbledore appeared to be fighting a struggle within himself. ""Harry,"" the old wizard said, his voice rising, ""this is a dangerous road you are walking, I am not sure I do the right thing by saying this, but I must wrench you from this way! Harry, how could Voldemort have survived the death of his body if he did not have a soul?""

And that was when Harry realized that there was exactly one person who'd originally told Professor McGonagall that the Dark Lord was still alive in the first place; and it was the crazy Headmaster of their madhouse of a school, who thought the world ran on cliches.

""Good question,"" Harry said, after some internal debate about how to proceed. ""Maybe he found some way of duplicating the power of the Resurrection Stone, only he loaded it in advance with a complete copy of his brain state. Or something like that."" Harry was suddenly far from sure that he was trying to come up with an explanation for something that had actually happened. ""Actually, can you just go ahead and tell me everything you know about how the Dark Lord survived and what it might take to kill him?"" If he even still exists as more than Quibbler headlines.

""You are not fooling me, Harry,"" said the old wizard; his face looked ancient now, and lined by more than years. ""I know why you are truly asking that question. No, I do not read your mind, I do not have to, your hesitation gives you away! You seek the secret of the Dark Lord's immortality in order to use it for yourself!""

""Wrong! I want the secret of the Dark Lord's immortality in order to use it for everyone!""",,False,,t5_2qh2k,1337451383.0,,,True,t3_tss72,http://www.reddit.com/r/Transhuman/comments/tss72/harry_potter_and_the_methods_of_rationality_on/,

While theoretically and technically television may be feasible, commercially and financially I consider it an impossibility, a development of which we need waste little time dreaming.
- Lee DeForest, American radio pioneer, 1926

This `telephone' has too many shortcomings to be seriously considered as a practical form of communication. The device is inherently of no value to us.
- Western Union internal memo, 1878

...no possible combination of known substances, known forms of machinery, and known forms of force, can be united in a practical machine by which man shall fly long distances through the air...
- Simon Newcomb (1835-1909), astronomer,
head of the U.S. Naval Observatory

We have reached the limits of what is possible with computers.
- John Von Neumann, 1949

Approximately 80% of our air pollution stems from hydrocarbons released by vegetation. So let's not go overboard in setting and enforcing tough emissions standards for man-made sources.
- Ronald Reagan, 1980

It's evident that there will always be detractors for any new technological advancement, but somehow these quotes give me hope. Seeing so many people today rant and rave about the impossibility of things, and then seeing those same attitudes applied in the past to things we now use extensively in commercial and everyday life makes me feel a bit more optimistic about the future.

I know a lot of what is here are fascinating news stories. But I am curious.

* Right now, transgender people are lacking a lot of technologies that we would like for transitioning. There is hormone replacement therapy. And various things to change body hair and so forth.

* But certainly nothing to change the actual genitals of a person(to be reproductively functional, at least). Which is obviously something that many of us would like, fully functioning genitalia for the gender we wish to be. Even less, there is lacking the ability to change the height, the shoulder size, the hip size, the foot size, and so forth of a person. Things that pain many a trans-person. I know transwomen who are 6 feet tall and it greatly pains them now unfeminine this makes them feel.

Or, that they simply didn't do their homework and have little grasp on what's really going on? Some of the common ones I've heard are:

1. the brain is too complex to decode
2. quantum properties won't allow computers to miniaturize to the nano scale
3. it may never be possible to understand conciousness
4. machine intelligence will only ever be the illusion of intelligence
5. the singularity is just a geek rapture (that one hurt, Gibson)

Of course, these are just addressing the feasibility of the Singularity. The ethical debate has quite a laundry list of common arguments (often more thought provoking):
1. Why would AI smarter than us (Artillects) want/need to keep us around?
2. Won't transhumanist resources initially only be available to the upper class, therefore causing the class divide to become an irreconcilable rift which leaves the poor on the endangered species list? 

Feel free to expand on these lists.    

I don't know that this subreddit is active enough to spark a lively debate, but its worth a shot.

*edit - Thanks for all the insights reddit, keep 'em coming. For the record, I'd like to see more open discussions like this in Transhuman subreddit.

Considering that we already have the technology to build awesome legs, arms and hands, when do you think they will be better than our natural bodyparts? When they will be available to the middle class? I saw some i-limb hand models around 10.000-20.000$, which is not very much if you ask me, but still not affordable.
As for now, that particular model has still some problems like a small angle for wrist mobility and the time required to close/open the grip, but overall it seems great to me. Looking at some FRIDA robot videos, it's like we should get rid of those issues somewhat quickly. Is there anything else holding us back here?

A thing that seems very obvious to me, but maybe there's some sort of problem I didn't think of, is that they will become a must for astronauts, other than for the sci-fi concept of super policemen. I mean: we all know that a prolonged time in space could alter our bone mass, so having less parts of the body to exercise for means astronauts would need much less calories and all, other than giving them some free time. A thought that is surely appliable to food problems we could have in future, even if I don't think we should worry about that, while that's definetely a problem in space exploration or planet colonization.

1. Should research be regulated at all?
2. Which dangers do you see in emerging technologies?
3. One Transhumanist argument I stumbled upon a few times reminded me of the Neoclassical growth model: we have to develop in order to maintain our society. What is the average Transhumanist opinion about a Steady State (No Growth) Society?
4. Is it appropriate to understand Transhumanism as partially driven by a counter movement against religious and conservative US-authorities?

There is no doubt that those in the know and with the money will undergo anti-aging therapies, but do we want the wider population to be aware of it?

I am a volunteer for the SENS foundation.  Though sculpting a decidedly mainstream medicine approach (as they should, unfortunately many large and established firms won't involve themselves with something like transhumanism) we would be kidding ourselves if it didn't have some roots in transhumanism, even if just by association.  It's a bit self serving, but I would like this thread to be an open forum of sorts, where people can discuss on how to push *all* of our ideologies in the right direction.

They're Made out of Meat
a short story by Terry Bisson
 
 
""They're made out of meat."" 
 
""Meat?"" 
 
""Yes, meat. They're made out of meat."" 
 
""Really?"" 
 
""There's no doubt about it. We picked up several from different parts of the planet, took them aboard our recon vessels, and probed them all the way through. They're completely meat.""  
 
""That's impossible. What about the radio signals? The messages to the stars?"" 
 
""They use the radio waves to talk, but the signals don't come from them. The signals come from machines."" 
 
""So who made the machines? That's who we want to contact."" 
 
""They made the machines. That's what I'm trying to tell you. Meat made the machines.""  
 
""That's ridiculous. How can meat make a machine? You're asking me to believe in sentient meat."" 
 
""I'm not asking you, I'm telling you. These creatures are the only sentient race in that sector and they're made out of meat."" 
 
""Maybe they're like the orfolei. You know, a carbon-based intelligence that goes through a meat stage."" 
 
""Nope. They're born meat and they die meat. We studied them for several of their life spans, which didn't take long. Do you have any idea what's the life span of meat?"" 
 
""Spare me. Okay, maybe they're only part meat. You know, like the weddilei. A meat head with an electron plasma brain inside."" 
 
""Nope. We thought of that, since they do have meat heads, like the weddilei. But I told you, we probed them. They're meat all the way through."" 
 
""No brain?"" 
 
""Oh, there's a brain all right. It's just that the brain is made out of meat! That's what I've been trying to tell you."" 
 
""So ... what does the thinking?""  
 
""You're not understanding, are you? You're refusing to deal with what I'm telling you. The brain does the thinking. The meat."" 
 
""Thinking meat! You're asking me to believe in thinking meat!"" 

""Yes, thinking meat! Conscious meat! Loving meat. Dreaming meat. The meat is the whole deal!  Are you beginning to get the picture or do I have to start all over?"" 
 
""Omigod. You're serious then. They're made out of meat."" 
 
""Thank you. Finally. Yes. They are indeed made out of meat. And they've been trying to get in touch with us for almost a hundred of their years."" 
 
""Omigod. So what does this meat have in mind?"" 
 
""First it wants to talk to us. Then I imagine it wants to explore the Universe, contact other sentiences, swap ideas and information. The usual."" 
 
""We're supposed to talk to meat."" 
 
""That's the idea. That's the message they're sending out by radio. 'Hello. Anyone out there. Anybody home.' That sort of thing."" 
 
""They actually do talk, then. They use words, ideas, concepts?"" 
 
""Oh, yes. Except they do it with meat."" 
 
""I thought you just told me they used radio."" 
 
""They do, but what do you think is on the radio? Meat sounds. You know how when you slap or flap meat, it makes a noise? They talk by flapping their meat at each other. They can even sing by squirting air through their meat.""  
 
""Omigod. Singing meat. This is altogether too much. So what do you advise?"" 
 
""Officially or unofficially?""  
 
""Both."" 
 
""Officially, we are required to contact, welcome and log in any and all sentient races or multibeings in this quadrant of the Universe, without prejudice, fear or favor. Unofficially, I advise that we erase the records and forget the whole thing."" 
 
""I was hoping you would say that."" 
 
""It seems harsh, but there is a limit. Do we really want to make contact with meat?"" 
 
""I agree one hundred percent. What's there to say? 'Hello, meat. How's it going?' But will this work? How many planets are we dealing with here?"" 
 
""Just one. They can travel to other planets in special meat containers, but they can't live on them. And being meat, they can only travel through C space. Which limits them to the speed of light and makes the possibility of their ever making contact pretty slim. Infinitesimal, in fact."" 
 
""So we just pretend there's no one home in the Universe."" 
 
""That's it.""  
 
""Cruel. But you said it yourself, who wants to meet meat? And the ones who have been aboard our vessels, the ones you probed? You're sure they won't remember?"" 
 
""They'll be considered crackpots if they do. We went into their heads and smoothed out their meat so that we're just a dream to them."" 
 
""A dream to meat! How strangely appropriate, that we should be meat's dream.""  
 
""And we marked the entire sector unoccupied."" 
 
""Good. Agreed, officially and unofficially. Case closed. Any others? Anyone interesting on that side of the galaxy?"" 
 
""Yes, a rather shy but sweet hydrogen core cluster intelligence in a class nine star in G445 zone. Was in contact two galactic rotations ago, wants to be friendly again.""  
 
""They always come around."" 
 
""And why not? Imagine how unbearably, how unutterably cold the Universe would be if one were all alone ...""

I am a volunteer working on behalf of the SENS foundation, located in Mountain View, California.  For those of you unfamiliar with the SENS foundation, here is our mission statement as located on our website, www.sens.org.  **The SENS Foundation works to develop, promote and ensure widespread access to rejuvenation biotechnologies which comprehensively address the disabilities and diseases of aging.**

SENS has had a very good past year.  Not only is our cause becoming better known to the scientific community, SENS is currently conducting numerous experiments and projects designed to further our knowledge of the aging process and allow us to eventually effectively combat it.  However, we need help in furthering not only our group, but causes related to it.  We have found that some of the best and most effectual assets in helping our research are the volunteers that work on behalf of SENS.  Even doing minimal, part time work makes a huge difference and as a volunteer, I can say that many of the people who work for and with me have provided tremendous help to the cause.  

I am working for SENS because I believe they and their vision can transform our world for the better.  For any of those interested in doing the same, please feel free to send me a message.  Also, please visit www.SENS.org  for more information on our group!

EDIT - just to clarify, volunteer work does NOT have to be on site in California.  I live on the other side of America, and many who volunteer for SENS not only do not live in California, but aren't even located in America.  Volunteer work is often conducted online, so physical location is not a problem :)",,False,,t5_2qh2k,True,,,True,t3_sgbmb,http://www.reddit.com/r/Transhuman/comments/sgbmb/an_appeal_from_the_sens_foundation/,

In the possible future where mind uploading becomes possible, say around 2045, the current incarceratory paradigm of jailing a person's body will become pointless...even laughable, because that body will be merely an avatar.  If that person has done something which causes a government entity to want to incarcerate him, they can take the avatar body, jail it, even destroy it, but the actual consciousness of the person could exist elsewhere in a remote server cloud, and possibly even redundantly so.  At that point in time the idea that you can lock away and control a person merely by restraining and restricting their current body becomes risible.

And even in a future closer than 2045, radio-enabled neural implants will soon become possible  (see Kevin Warwick's TED talk: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8HeFNJjuj0&amp;feature=relmfu).  In this scenario, the present physical location of any person becomes progressively less relevant to his experience, and such implants would even enable remote communication and control with other humans and systems, which would interfere with the government's ability to prevent that person from influencing the world outside the jail.

So in both these scenarios, it becomes progressively more difficult for a government body (or anyone for that matter), to incarcerate/quarantine/control another human/posthuman, making the idea of jail pointless...unless the jail paradigm were to be modified as well, which would involve ever increasingly complex measures to isolate and control ever changing posthuman entities.  This would of course have pretty large impacts for government who incessantly work to expunge terrorists.

Thoughts?

-------------------------------------------------------

Although in my preferred future scenario, even if my consciousness is redundantly co-located, I'd have a robot army to come extract me from whatever situation I might get myself into if I run into trouble ;-)

From the Bacchae: ""Pentheus's men bring in a chained Dionysus. Of course, they have no idea that they've got the actual god on their hands, since Dionysus is in mortal form. They think the Stranger is just the head of this new Dionysian cult. King Pentheus mocks the Stranger and tells him he looks girly. The King locks Dionysus up in jail, but swiftly regrets it. The god summons earthquakes and lightning, flattening his jail and ravaging the palace.""

Does it make surpassing the human condition entirely impossible? Is it necessary to reduce entropy in order to achieve the future we dream of, or can we do it without such physical impossibilities and logical contradictions? How does a ""post scarcity"" society exist with the increasing entropy of the universe?

I've read a lot on aging and increasing how long we can live, but can that length be extended indefinitely, or does that contradict basic thermodynamics? Is growing young an achievable process, or is it mere fancy? It's possible we could extend life a hundred even a thousand more years, but humans already live to be much older than almost every animal on earth and it still hardly seems satisfying to go out at 100, and miss the uncountable years afterwards. I would think having life limited at the age of the sun, you'd just have more wonderful experiences and knowledge to lose, making the death all the more poignant.

The usual argument against immortality is that it would be terrible watching everything you love die around you, and that seems an argument directly on the nature of the inevitable progression of the universe from less entropy to greater entropy. That is to say, if you can be immortal, then everything around you can too, and if everything you love can't last forever, then neither can you, since we're all made of the same stuff. Can we achieve that sort of perpetual existence within our lifetimes, or can anyone ever achieve it, without entropy as a whole decreasing?",,False,,t5_2qh2k,False,,,True,t3_1k8gul,http://www.reddit.com/r/Transhuman/comments/1k8gul/entropy/,

The belief that technology will one day enable indefinite human life spans is the only thing that keeps me from becoming a total freeloader (which I was for my late-teens, early twenties. I enjoyed it very much).

My plan is to be cryogenically frozen before I die (if I die). It's relatively affordable, if you get a large enough insurance plan to cover it. However, that is just Plan B. Plan A is to be able to afford organ transplants and other bodily upkeep every couple of decades, as I will need to repair myself as I age.

So my primary objective in life is to become as wealthy as possible, so that I can afford Plan A. As such, I spend a lot of time thinking about how to become wealthy without turning into an evil person that I would hate. The projects I've been developing take up 80-95% of my time, leaving me fairly lonely most days.

This loneliness causes me think if I'm spending my days properly. Can I be less lonely but still on track to become wealthy? Can I spend time developing hobbies that will make me more attractive to the opposite sex, or should I stick to my business plans 100% of the time? I don't want to risk too much time socializing when a lot of the time I spend socializing ends up being, at best, unfruitful, and at worst a couple wasted days recovering from the events of the previous night.

Given that the universe will eventually decay to nothingness due to entropy, even if we could live ""forever"", that would only be another 13 billion years or so. I personally think a gradual fading out of consciousness would be more preferable than the abrupt shock that ordinary human death often looks like. And physicists still don't know yet if we can escape our current universe or not.

That said, the thoughts of death do make one wonder if taking more risks or seeking out immediate pleasure is a better choice than simply saving for a future event that is 100% certain. I think about it regularly. I've come to a mostly logical conclusion that spending a couple decades building a business to potentially live thousands of years is, in my opinion, worth it. I just have a hard time convincing myself of it every day, and I'd enjoy the opinion of others.",,False,,t5_2qh2k,False,,,True,t3_1hmu79,http://www.reddit.com/r/Transhuman/comments/1hmu79/on_death_wealth_and_transhumanism/,

I have been following the body mod scene for awhile, and though having magnetic sense via magnetic implants is a neat trick, I believe these ideas are just the beginning. I am holding out hope for a surge of playful inventing and boundary pushing that will make cyberpunk culture/transhumanism a reality.

I've slogged through endless pictures and forum posts to find a few gems like these magnetic implants, and the old (but still neat) concept of pierced glasses:

""For Stelios, the teletransporter is the only way to travel. Previously it took months to get from the Earth to Mars, confined to a cramped spacecraft with a far from perfect safety record. Stelios's TeletransportExpress changed all that. Now the trip takes just minutes, and so far it has been 100 percent safe.

However, now he is facing a lawsuit from a disgruntled customer who is claiming the company actually killed him. His argument is simple: the teletransporter works by scanning your brain and body cell by cell, destroying them, beaming the information to Mars and reconstructing you there. Although the person on Mars looks, feels and thinks just like a person who has been sent to sleep and zapped across space, the claimant argues that what actually happens is that you are murdered and replaced by a clone.

To Stelios, this sounds absurd. After all, he has taken the teletransporter trip dozens of times, and he doesn't feel dead. Indeed, how can the claimant seriously believe that he has been killed by the process when he is clearly able to take the case to court?

On the plus side, there are a growing number of organizations like SENS (http://www.sens.org/), Humanity+ (http://humanityplus.org/), and the Singularity Institute (http://singularity.org/) which are working to improve public understanding of these concepts.

One major advance, though, is still thoroughly mired in controversy and stigma, with a reputation primarily for being a creepy fringe cult for nutjobs and weirdos. There's already tremendous work being done to develop the fundamental science, and to organize that research into a coherent roadmap, but there's no concerted effort yet to tell the world that this might really come true - or why that might even be a good thing.

So, let's start an advocacy group dedicated to promoting the possibility of mind uploading.

I'm looking for volunteers to help me design and create this group. This means people with experience anywhere in marketing strategy, brand management, business development, defining marketing plans and campaigns, SEO, market research/analysis, project management, conducting and measuring campaigns, etc. We'd start by looking for more volunteers to round out the team, then gradually add bigger projects, build an image, and ultimately - if we can build critical mass - work toward hosting conferences and mainstream advertising.

[http://ieet.org/index.php/IEET/more/5504](http://ieet.org/index.php/IEET/more/5504)
&gt;
Reports have been issued from the family, indicating that they believe Mike is safe and thanking IEET members for their help.

&gt;A report has been issued from Steve Treder. The report states:

&gt;“The police have confirmation that Mike left Detroit and entered Canada last week. We don’t know why. But with no evidence that violence has been done to him, the investigation as to his whereabouts is being suspended indefinitely. The family thanks everyone for their concern.”

&gt;Another statement by the family says: “We believe he went on his own volition and is safe. So there is no longer a need for an investigation into his whereabouts. The family would like to thank everyone for their concern.”

&gt;Here’s a news article on the matter:

&gt;IEET is going to respect the privacy of the family members by closing all discussion and speculation on the incident.

This means, above all else, that we work to anticipate what technologies will emerge, and how they will change humanity's future. The word as a whole does not imply anything else, as much as we might wish it did.
2. We must back up our statements. We are not the only school of thought that looks to anticipate the future. Other paradigms exist. Just like those paradigms of thought, we must bring proof, evidence, and rational thought to the table or our statements can be dismissed as easily as those claiming that supernatural entities will bring about the end of the world.
3. We must be honest with ourselves. If we are not familiar with the valid criticisms of our arguments, then we leave our predictions and inferences about the future of the world weak and idealist. If you cannot accept when an opponent has a valid opinion that you cannot argue, it is far more respectable to temporarily admit defeat until you can find evidence that disproves their statements, or simply acknowledge their beliefs are equally valid.
4. We must discard non-falsifiables. If there is no way to back up a statement other than 'time will tell', not even evidence of some sort of progress being made that way, it is not useful to argue in your capacity as a futurist.
5. We must understand that we see things differently from mainstream culture. If you are going to make radical statements, be prepared to put forth the building blocks to build your Tower of Babel. Be aware that statements may be misconstrued even if true, and that if you care futurism's public opinion, that moderation or rephrasing may be warranted.
6. We must understand that we see things different from each other. No two futurists will necessarily share the same views on politics, religion, metaphysics, or even precisely what technologies, trends, and changes may emerge or be wrought upon the world. Expecting otherwise by default will only lead to sectarianism. In addition to perspective, cultural differences exist as well.
7. We must not conflate our hopes and dreams with what will absolutely happen. While technology progresses naturally, do not be fooled into thinking that simply because it exists that it will be used the way you want it to.
8. We must remember that if we work for the future we want, and strive to make it, it is much more likely to happen. Humanity is a glorious, wonderful, world shaping entity. The golden path is there in front of us, even if each lane splits and merges countless times.

in the next few months I'm getting neodium magnets 2mm diamater discs x1mm thickness coated in parylene a bio compatable substance implanted in my finger tips, to give me a 6th sense.

these implants will be put inder my finger tips into the sensitive nerve cluster and will react to electric and magnetic fields alowing me to feel these fields just like a breeze.

I have been researching the processes for a few months now and am happy with my findings. I don't like tattoos or other aesthetic body mods like piercing.

so my question to you guys, is there any other passive low maintenence mods someone can get to enhance the human condition obviously contact lenses come to mind so things along those lines?

He is really passionate about knowledge and tinkering, insanely hard working. The most recent maths course he took was Differential Equations, and has has done some basic anatomy/physiology courses. He is looking into UNL after doing what he can in a Community College. He doesn't seem to know anything about grants or scholarships for this (he is 23) &amp; no clue about interning either.

The races competing in this far-future world represent various lines that will be points of contention as transhumanism becomes the driving force behind our evolution.

CLASSIFICATION 0, or “Primitives” Humans who reject not just bodily alteration, but also electronic technolgy and industrially-produced medicine altogether. The Amish of the future. They are usually bound together by religious ties and have very short lifespans. Their living conditions have caused them to become very well physically-adapted to their environments. Primitives hold no power on a larger than local scale. They are as irrelevant now as chimps were at the dawn of the 21st Century. They have been granted ecologically-viable land on multiple worlds, which are protected as wildlife preserves. Their ability to protect this land from higher beings, should such beings ever decide to take it away, is nonexistent.

CLASSIFICATION 1, or “Purists” Humans who are very close to who we are today. They will take drugs as long as they don’t involve intelligent nanomachines or genetic therapy. They will even make use of external cybernetics like night vision glasses and communication headsets. Most are also willing to use low-tech cybernetics like cochlear implants to cure deafness and replacement limbs for the disabled. Purists eke out a small amount of relevance by making use of remotely- and directly-piloted vehicles with non-invasive brain-to-computer interfaces. They are, however, not seen as a legitimate military power by most of the higher-classification beings. Some purists, classified “1i,” are willing to cooperate with non-self-aware AIs such as thinking attack drones that can execute combat missions without needing to be controlled from a remote location.

CLASSIFICATION 2, or “Geneoids” Humans, transhumans (and in some cases, posthumans) who reject cybernetics to the same degree as or to a greater degree than Classification 1 humans. However, they are fully open to gene therapy, eugenics, and outright genetic enhancement. They can be subdivided into Classification 2a, representing humans who accept only genetic modifications that would not cause them to exceed the bounds or anatomical forms of “natural” humans, and Classification 2b, representing those who will accept any degree of genetic modification (including things like extra limbs, reptilian skin, etc.) A “c” is used to note those of Classification 2 who accept brain-altering modifications. This creates two additional subclasses: 2ac and 2bc. Like Classification 1 humans, Classification 2 transhumans and posthumans usually rely on remotely- or directly-piloted vehicles with non-invasive interfaces to perform tasks that come naturally to beings of higher classification. They are somewhat more relevant on the galactic power scale, especially 2bs and 2bcs, due to their willingness to transcend human physical and/or mental boundaries. However, their willingness to do so only through the relatively inefficient medium of genetic modification limits them to only holding power on a larger scale very rarely. Genoids that cooperate with non-self-aware AI are classified with an “i,” as in “2bci,” designating the most liberal of the Class 2s.

CLASSIFICATION 3, or “Cyborgs” Transhumans in this category are willing to accept a vast variety of cybernetics, as extreme as having every cell in their body replaced by a carbon-based nanocomputer. Many are not attached to the human anatomical form, and will instead choose forms based on things like starships, submersibles, and land vehicles. Many change their physical form regularly. Some, referred to as “Classification 3-multi,” are comfortable with operating multiple copies of their neural structure in multiple physical housings that might be light years apart. What sets them apart from higher-classification posthumans is their unwillingness to give up the brain. They require any modifications to their physical form to preserve the neural structure and operation of the biological brain they were born with. Additional software that supplements this structure is accepted by most, but any software must be subservient to the “Neuro-seed,” and alterations to it are forbidden by any means. Classification 3 are the lowest classification of beings that hold some form of power on a galactic scale. Especially in the case of 3-multis, they can often compete for resources on fronts that are deemed too unimportant by higher classification beings to commit too much energy to. They rule the fringes of space. In the case of “Hard 3s,” sexual reproduction and cloning is still often used to create new Neuro-seeds. 3-multis, however, generally expand their numbers simply by creating more copies of existing Neuro-seeds. Class 3s that cooperate with non-self-aware AIs are not given their own classification, as it would be redundant. The line between a “non-self-aware AI” and the neural accessory processors used by Class 3s is virtually nonexistent.

Calssification 4: “Independent AIs” Posthumans who have given up every vestige of what biological humanity represented. They take whatever forms they wish, copy and evolve their software through millions of iterations a year, existing in thousands of places at once, and network with others like them to pool information and resources. Where they have drawn the line is at individuality. Each Classification 4 being has an identity at the core of their software, dating back to a human birth and upbringing in the annals of the past. They refuse to be subsumed into any form of collective consciousness, and are capable of keeping secrets and making decisions independent of the input of other entities. Classification 4s were the dominant force in the galaxy for a great while, before the rise of their successor. Even today, they still control large portions of rich space that the “Great Enemy” has not yet devoted time and resources to dominating. They fight amongst each-other uncommonly, and in some areas battle guerrilla bands of Classification 3s looking to carve resources off the edges of their territory. They regard their primary opponent with a sort of Cold War, nonviolent watchfulness. It seems to be doing the same, for now.

Classification 5: “PHMO” Referred to as “Pheemo” by those beings who still use their mouths to articulate language (and are even aware of its existence), PHMO stands for Post-Human Meta-Organism. It is technology unbounded by any sense of ethics: an essentially godlike network of trillions of machines of varying sizes and functions, most of which can change form at will to suit any situation. It holds the memories and experiences, as well as all recorded knowledge, of every human and computer that contributed to its mainframes at some point in the past. It can access, analyze, and synthesize all of this data with perfect recall and at the speed of light, collating it with the new data it is collecting constantly from all of its networked sensor units. There is no doubt that PHMO has become the dominant force in the Milky Way galaxy, and in all likelihood may already be operating beyond it. Few are operating under the delusion that it couldn’t wipe out all lower-classification beings if it really wanted to. Class 4s have fought massive engagements with its fleets too many times to count, but it never seems to go in for the kill in the end. For now, it seems to have deemed to tolerate lesser intelligent existences operating in its shadow. How long that state of affairs will last, not even the greatest minds of the Class 4s can precisely predict.",,False,,t5_2qh2k,False,,,True,t3_kr5lv,http://www.reddit.com/r/Transhuman/comments/kr5lv/writing_a_scifi_story_based_on_transhumanism/,

how do you purpose we solve possible future overpopulation or too much crowding on earth?

How do you purpose we use technology to eliminate 'evil' and 'suffering' if there is great disagreement  as to what their true meaning is?

How do we prevent possible criminals (if we do not eliminate evil) murdering people who do not choose transhumanism immortality? 

How do we prevent the exploitation of life extension technology? How do we prevent the select few from keeping it all to their selves?

What is your opinion on virtual reality for life extension?

What is your opinion on cyborgs and replacing our body parts with newly grown parts?

What will happen to those who do not choose transhumanist technology? 
What if someone decides they want to die, but also calls to be brought back to life if something might happen (say we explored a new planet)?
How will this process work? 

How will transhumanism affect the physical universe?

How do we prevent biotechnology from becoming too expensive for a human payed an average income?

How would transhumanism affect the economy, law, and culture?

How would transhumanist technology affect rationality, human instincts, and emotion?

Is there any evidence that consciousness can be manipulated into computer networks?

Can consciousness work without a brain? 

What political society is best for maintaining transhumanism? 

If massive life extensions is in effect, what will be the *new* philosophical meaning of our lives? Is our philosophy to possibly  venture into the universe with our profound extension of experience?

I'm very interested in working on research that contributes to transhumanism in some way, but my options are somewhat limited, since I have to work on whatever my advisor's working on.  My ultimate goal is to work on bionanotechnology, and I'm choosing between two labs right now.

The first lab is working on lab-on-a-chip stuff, where I would be studying microscale interactions of a certain drug with human blood on a chip.

The second lab is developing a means of drug delivery based on gold nanoparticles.

Both professors have similar h-index ratings--for the lab-on-a-chip professor, he is older, tenured, hard to get a hold of but has a lot of connections and reputation.

For the nanoparticle professor, he is much younger, a very small lab group, not as many connections but did a postdoc with one of the most famous chemists in the world so that's a good connection to have.  He's not tenured, but I think he'll get it within a few years.

Any input would be appreciated.  I feel like the lab-on-a-chip stuff would be good for eventually working towards developing nanorobotics, but that's a much further off goal, whereas the drug delivery stuff would be more interesting for getting involved with the field of bionanotech.

Hey there Reddit.

My name is Colin Popell. 

I’d like to share with you the first public statement about my new company, Noo-Mix LLC. Nootropics are 'smart' supplements, or supplements that augment mental capability in one way or another. I took a look at the current nootropic market, and it leaves much to be desired.

A lot of the supplement market lacks a scientific bearing, and unfortunately this is true for a lot of nootropic suppliers as well. This is a problem, because I’m a firm believer that the nootropics market is one that should be supported and helped to grow.

So I decided to do my part to change it. Noo-Mix LLC will be a science based, as transparent as possible, research friendly company built with the help of, and to the benefit of, the communities it interacts with. We won’t sell you any supplements we can’t find data that supports, we’ll conduct tests and gather data as much as possible, and we’ll pull products we find to either have adverse effects or no effect.

**How are we going to do this?** I am trying to build the most comprehensive data set of the effect of various stacks, demographics, interactions, backgrounds, and any other variables that might affect interactions with nootropics.

We’re also pretty sure we’re going to offer a few features no other company yet offers, but we’ll keep that on the down-low for now.

**Where do we want to go with this?** Well, fairly obviously I’d like the company to grow and make money. I’d also like to spread nootropics more into the mainstream on college campuses (less reliance on amphetamines by people who don’t understand them), clear up misconceptions of nootropics, and gather the largest database of nootropic interactions in the world.

I’m a transhumanist too, and I’d like to use this as a platform to help support the transhumanist community. All of my investors are going into this with the understanding that a portion of our profits may be reinvested into other emerging technologies, using this company as a launch platform. I don’t want to go into details here, but you can bet that money will be going into interesting projects in both drug and technological research.

**How can you help us?** Pretty easy, actually. As ambitious as my goals might be, I’m only starting out with a finite amount of cash. So linked at the top and bottom of this page is a survey on your nootropic habits. Feel free to fill it out in as much detail or as little detail as you want (though more is obviously preferable to me), but please fill it out. The more people who fill it out, the better data we’ll get, and the better we can optimize our initial expenses. Plus it gives us market data so that we can get more money from investors to expand faster, and to serve our customers better.

Sorry, tl;dr That’s okay, I know it was wordy. Basically, new supplement company wants to set a scientific and business standard, wants your business, wants to support the community, and wants data on your nootropic habits.

I think the most obvious result of this type of posthuman gender scenario is that there will be no gender roles. In a society in which gender can be changed at will, I see no logical possibility that concepts such as homosexuality, trans-sexuality, and sexual liberation will be seen as negative at all. These would be simply unavoidable and vastly entertained ideas. 

However, the question I have always asked myself is this: Will technology and posthumanism eliminate gender roles, or is the elimination of gender roles necessary to achieve acceptance of this technology?

I'm a 25 year old college drop out, with an amateur knowledge base in computer programming (visual basic, some java, some c++), and film, and a passion for transhuman body modification, and augmented reality. I am looking to go back to school in the near future and would like to attempt to gain entry into a career in user end augmented reality software programming and design, working on applications for developing technology (for example the augmented reality glasses google is working on). what would be a suggested major for breaking into the industry? My first thought was computer science, but is this too broad? Are there any schools or programs that point more specifically towards this field? Anyone know what languages applications for this type of technology would be programmed in? Anything I can do in the mean time to prepare myself for this? Any help from inside the field, or knowledge about it would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.

I take resveratrol, fish oil, vitamin D and ALA.  I try to meditate too but I'm not too regular.  I carry a smart phone.  Isn't there anything else I can reasonably do or should be doing to really be a transhuman?

Edit 1:  The answers I've read make reasonable comment that transhumanism is more a belief system than a recipe and that's a good point.  But I don't want to equivocate here, I think transhumanists can't just believe, I actually 
think we have to do something.  Think of my post as a plea about what should we do to achieve transhumanism.

Edit 2:  A good point was made by Mr. PornoWizard aboud doing something meaningful.  My post is really a message in the bottle to get an idea of what other meaningful things I can do that others are already doing and that are not necessarily common.  Some simple meaningful things show up I hope, and some more longer term.

Edit 3:  There are a number of down votes for this thread, which is fine but I'm interested in knowing why?  Is it wrong to question what one must do to be a transhumanist beyond just 'keeping the faith' so to speak.  To eventually go beyond being human musn't we do something significant to ourselves?  Naturally there's no point in proposing using a technology that doesn't exist yet but shouldn't transhumanists be supporting or doing research and experimentation that will ultimately make one a transhuman?  

Edit 4:  Some grammar changes.  Another question comes to mind: ""Is transhumanism a fools quest?""  I'm serious here.  One of the things an old math professor of mine taught me that has kinda stuck with me is whether a solution even exists.  Is it possible to move beyond being a 'mere' human?

So I figured I would try here.


Due to an injury to my eye (the other one wasn't harmed) I acquired several months ago, my retina was detached and even with regular visits to the eye doctor, there was a lot of scarring and some of my retina had to be removed.



I can still see light (though not as much as I would like), colors, and even very blurry hands (can occasionally count fingers) and room details (nearby lamps, etc). That being said, there is a lot of grey and shadows.



Even with all this work being done, I won't have the vision I had before. I don't know if I'll be able to read with that eye ever again. I have lately been reading posts about scientists regrowing retina, using it to restore some vision to blind people. I have also heard of mice with eye diseases (bred to have them for experiments) can be stimulated to regrow retina where it was damaged. What other advances are being made in restoring vision and when will some of these some of these advances be available for clinical use?



In addition, my iris is pulled back by scar tissue that has reformed after surgery. It looks very dilated, even without dilating drops. Also, my ciliary body is not functioning properly since if it was covered in scar tissue, my injured eye is currently inflated by oil and has virtually no pressure. What advances are being made in these areas?

Other thoughts:

- I'm not sure I want to go with transhumanism as the name, I fall more into the extropy school of thought. I don't have anything against the name transhumanist though, but someone mentioned it might scare away part of the audience.

Thoughts? I hope this is allowed here.

Why are people always on about the Turning Test? Why would anyone expect a non-human intelligence to be indistinguishable from a human intelligence? It seems such an arbitrary and worthless standard. How many of us could write something in an afternoon that would at least reach the standard of the average youtube commentator?

How many autistic people would pass the Turing Test? Are they therefore not conscious, intelligent beings?

The test seems to instantly disqualify something more intelligent than us or something that doesn't care about the same things.

Wouldn't a better test be a scenario in which new knowledge must be deduced and applied to reach a non-stated complex objective, to demonstrate goal creation, understanding, learning and preference?",,False,,t5_2qh2k,False,,,True,t3_fuxdr,http://www.reddit.com/r/Transhuman/comments/fuxdr/can_anyone_explain_to_me_why_people_think_the/,
