1351619220.0,592,self.drums,12cjmt,"Question: Would anyone be interested in downloading a folder with 900 or so popular/current ""drumless"" songs?",655,63,157,http://www.reddit.com/r/drums/comments/12cjmt/question_would_anyone_be_interested_in/,"I happened across this download a while back and, while the quality varies from track to track, it's really fun to play along with all these current songs!

It appears to be all the songs from Rockband, just with the drum track left out.

I only ask beforehand because I'll have to figure out a place to host it (probably Google Drive or something) and take the time to upload it - so I just want to see if there's interest.

Cheers Drummit!

EDIT: Please upvote if you're interested. Not for my karma's sake (it's a self post) but to make sure it gets as many eyes as possible. Thanks!

EDIT: Ok so there's obviously a huge demand for this. I'm really stoked that I can hook so many people up with this! I wasn't sure if it was just old news or whatever. I know it has been such a pleasure to drum with for me.

SO - I'm just at work right now and the files are on my computer at home. **As soon as I get home** I'll figure out the best way to upload everything and then I'll post up a link as soon as humanly possible.

Thanks for all the feedback drummiters!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

NEWEST EDIT:Ok, so I hate to be the bearer of bad news but I'm having a little trouble making this happen. It's still **definitely** going to happen, but it looks like it's 5.8 Gigs (actually 1,300 songs :p) and I don't have a ton of options for uploading this beast in a way that will be easy for everyone to grab.

I want to break them into smaller folders, but here's where it gets stupid - I just installed Windows 8 on my PC yesterday and I'm encountering painful bugs. Explorer actually crashes when I right-click or try to create a new folder... so yea... that makes uploading it in several folders tricky.

Anyway, I'm going to focus on trying to fix my Win 8 install right now and I will upload this stuff as soon as I can. I'm **really** sorry for the delay here folks. I'm doing my best. Bear with me :)

Just a little teaser for the time-being: [Here's the list I exported of all the files.](http://nickp.ca/RrNGFv) Sorry, it's a bit ugly.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

**FINAL FUCKING EDIT:**

Well shit. After all this pain and anguish, someone in the comments ([Doodeyfoodle](http://www.reddit.com/user/Doodeyfoodle)) just posted [a link to a Pirate Bay torrent](http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6764455/Drumless#filelistContainer) that has basically all the same songs I do. I actually collected mine across some random sites and put them together, but this torrent appears to have virtually all the same files (someone else probably curated them a year ago like I did).

So there you have it, a freely available torrent you can download with all the majesty that I promised... And me looking like a dumbass and not getting to be the hero /r/drums deserves.

Sorry folks :(

Again, here's the sacred file: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6764455/Drumless#filelistContainer

**If anyone is interested I'd be willing to go through the files and pick out the best quality ones and put up a significantly condensed version if you guys don't want to torrent 6 gigs**",,False,,t5_2qie5,1351656084.0,,,True,t3_12cjmt,http://www.reddit.com/r/drums/comments/12cjmt/question_would_anyone_be_interested_in/,

1369412615.0,165,self.drums,1ez874,Lately I've seen a lot of questions about how to mic a kit. I work in a recording studio and I thought I'd share some of my knowledge and experience with drummit!,180,15,44,http://www.reddit.com/r/drums/comments/1ez874/lately_ive_seen_a_lot_of_questions_about_how_to/,"**Where to begin?**

Before you even think about hitting record, you want to ensure that what you're recording sounds decent. If you want an awesome drum recording, the best place to start is an decent sounding kit. Contrary to what a lot of people believe, great gear doesn't necessarily mean great sound.

Never underestimate the importance of how you tune your drums. A mediocre kit with nice heads, tuned properly, is almost always going to sound better than an expensive kit without enough consideration gone into tuning. The [Drum Tuning Bible](http://www.menet.umn.edu/~kgeisler/Tuning.pdf), (which is linked on this subreddit) is a great place to start.

Clean your cymbals! Clean, polished cymbals will sound significantly brighter and more crisp than dull and dirty ones. This is due to them being able to move more freely, without the higher frequencies being choked and dampened by dirt/dust and oxidization. That being said, preference is a factor. Sometimes it is desirable to have duller, softer sounding cymbals, (some are made that way).

Other consideration that need to be made are:

* The Room
* Microphone Position
* Microphone Choice (If you have the option)

As a general rule, the room contributes to approximately 20% of the overall sound quality, even for drums that are close-miked. Mic position contributes another (approximate) 20% of your sound quality. Think of mic placement as your 'acoustic EQ' - placement is responsible for the 'blend' in your mix. Mic choice is seen as accounting for about 10% of your total sound quality, it's the difference between a 'good' and a 'great' sound. The remaining 50% of overall sound quality is the player, and the kit itself, (as discussed above).

**Miking Techniques:**

Stereo Miking.

Stereo miking = two microphones in different places, resulting in a stereo image, (two channels with different signals). Stereo miking allows you to convey a more realistic view of the size and width of your kit. Note that adding more than one mic will result in [phase interaction](http://www.mediacollege.com/audio/01/wave-interaction.html), i.e. same sound, similar volume. The following are some examples of stereo miking -

* [Spaced pair technique](http://i.imgur.com/WBJIaKC.jpg) (A-B):

This is when two microphones are placed parallel to each other, facing the sound source. When using the AB technique you must apply the 3:1 rule - this means that for every 1 unit of of measurement from the sound source, your mics must be 3x that distance from each other. For example, if your stereo pair is 1 meter from the sound source, your mics must be 3 meters apart. Either cardioid or omnidirectional mics would typically be used for this technique.

* [X-Y Technique](http://i.imgur.com/d3stmx6.jpg):

For X-Y, (also known as incident pair) the capsule ends of two cardioid microphones are positioned [on top of each other](http://i.imgur.com/WYou948.jpg), at a recommended angle of 90 - 135 degrees. The angle will determine the centre image/stereo width. X-Y will not produce a stereo image as wide as that of A-B, but you're are far less likely to run into any phasing issues. X-Y produces a good centre image.

**Some other Stereo Miking Techniques** which I will list and let you research yourself:

* [MS (Mid-Side) Technique](http://www.haydenloft.com/Home/techniques_files/mid_side.php) - (My personal favourite but by far the most complicated)
* [Blumlein](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blumlein_Pair)
* [NOS stereo technique](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOS_stereo_technique)
* [ORTF stereo technique](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ORTF_stereo_technique)
* [Binaural technique](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binaural_recording)

All of the above techniques can be used for 'Room Miking' - which are ambient microphones positioned in front of the kit that can later be blended with other drum tracks to give an additional 'room feel'. This can be subjective to processing without affecting the overall drum presence. Distance to the drum kit is quite critical and will require some experimenting - (the 'whichever sounds best' rule).

**Ambient or close-miking?**

* Ambient recording with spot mics will retain the stereo image and natural ambiance of the kit, but requires a good sounding recording environment.
* Close-miking will result in more flexibility during mixdown, and sounds can be processed and balanced individually. Ambient sound is less prominent.

**Miking the kit:**

* Overheads:

Overheads are the best place to asses the kit and get the drum sound you're after. Use either A-B (between 60cm - 130cm apart), or X-Y. Place the mics about 1 meter above the drummer's head and aim them at the cymbals. Excessive movement of the cymbals may cause the [Doppler effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppler_effect) if mics are too close. Keep in mind that with X-Y the left mic picks up the right side of the kit and vice versa. Use only condenser mics and engage the pad switch if available. Cardioid mics are most typically used, however omni and fig-of-8s can work as well.

* Kick Drum:

Dynamic mics with a large diaphragm, (e.g. [AKG D112](http://www.akg.com/D112-1039.html?pid=940) or a [Sure BETA 52A](http://www.shure.com/americas/products/microphones/beta/beta-52a-kick-drum-microphone)) are typically used to mic the kick as the generated SPL ([sound pressure level](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_pressure)) is too much for most condenser mics - I am referring to when the mic in positioned inside the kick drum itself. Having your microphone placed inside them kick drum shell (typically aimed at the beater, slightly off-axis) will produce a drier, more present sound, whereas outside the kick drum will result in a more ambient sound. If I have the option I will always do both, giving me the ability to blend the two signals and produce a fatter sound. Resonance of the drum will need to be dampened by a cushion(s) or similar. Beware of squeaky foot pedals.

* Snare:

A mic on the top head is going to give you the punch and a mic on the bottom will give you rattle. Keep in mind that if you have both a top and bottom mic, they will be out of phase - invert one's phase during mix. Aim the top mic at the centre of the skin, (not at the rim or lugs) making sure it is off-axis to the hats and the toms to reduce spill/bleed. To achieve a fatter sound, make use of the [proximity effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximity_effect_%28audio%29) by moving the mic closer to the skin. Make sure the bottom mic is also off-axis to the kick for the same reason. Typical mics used on snare would be a [Shure SM57](http://www.shure.com/americas/products/microphones/sm/sm57-instrument-microphone) or [BETA 57A](http://www.shure.com/americas/products/microphones/beta/beta-57a-instrument-microphone) - any dynamic vocal mic will work on the bottom head.

* Toms:

Toms are almost always going to have a mic on the top head. A bottom mic can be added but it will be very phase sensitive and generally lacks the clarity of a single top mic. Be sure to never aim a mic directly at a piece of dampening. The classical method of placement is to have the mic about 5cm/2 inches off the head above the rim, at a 45-degree angle aimed at the centre of the head. You can take the proximity effect into account with toms as well. For lower volume recordings you can use condenser mics (make sure you enable the pad switch). My personal favourite mic on toms is the [Sennheiser MD 421-II](http://en-us.sennheiser.com/recording-microphone-broadcasting-applications-md-421-ii). [Shure BETA 56A](http://www.shure.com/americas/products/microphones/beta/beta-56a-instrument-microphone)'s are also great on toms.

* Hats:

Hihats will often cut through into the other mics which is pretty unavoidable, but no biggie. To achieve more definition place a spot-mic on the hats, preferably a condenser with the pad switch on. During mix you'll want to roll off all the lower frequencies on your hats and they can be blended in at low level - (as a lot of their sound will be from the other mics). Be weary of the airflow generated by the opening and closing of the hats which will easily distort a sensitive condenser. To avoid this, the typical placement would be angle the mic at about 45 - 90 degrees to the hats, aimed at the edge of the cymbal for a shimmering sound, and at the bell for a harder sound. Position the mic so it is shielded from the snare and off-axis to the toms. A trusty Shure SM57 is also an acceptable mic to use on hats.

* Ride:

Your overheads should be sufficient to capture the ride, though lower and softer cymbals may require a spot mic. The ride cymbal is much the same as the hats.

**Conclusion:**

I really can't stress the listening test enough. *Never* be satisfied with just placing a mic and assuming it will sound good. No matter how good you think it sounds, it can *always* sound better.

Not everyone will have access to the large number of inputs/microphones necessary for a full-scale kit mic-up, but all the above information can be used as guidelines so you can experiment with what is available, and achieve the best sound possible.

I am happy to answer any more questions you may have regarding miking up drums, and recording in general.

1. Once a week, a rudiment is presented to the community.     
2. Drummit members have one week to apply the rudiment to the kit in a creative and musical way and upload a video of them playing to the sub.
3. A winner is decided at the end of the week through the mighty power of the upvote.

What do you win?  The awe and admiration of the drummit community and the knowledge that you've inspired us all to continue honing our skills.

Literally just type in ""drum cover"" on youtube and she WILL show up in the first page. She's a fine drummer, I just don't think she's anything special.

I was chatting with a guy about this in the top post on drummit about the Super Bowl drummer. I was told I was being sexist. You know what's REALLY sexist? Paying more attention to a drummer just because she's female. I don't think a lot of people understand this seemingly reverse sexism thing. They think watching female drummers is doing some sort of justice to society when really, they're just ignoring all the great male drummers out there.

I never once said that a drummer who is male is automatically better, but what pisses me off is that some people will watch an adequate female drummer over a great male drummer because b00bz. 

Am I just ranting? I guess.. Thoughts please.

Edit: lots of people are saying things along the lines of ""she's doing what she loves, why should that piss me off?"" And I'd like to give my counter for that before I go get my school work done:

The fact that she is doing what she loves is great. That in and of itself does not piss me off. I'm glad she gets paid to do what she loves, that's so awesome for her. I'm not jealous of anything, I'm not asking for views on *my* YouTube account, I'm not asking for people to watch me. I'm pissed because there are hundreds, if not thousands of great drummers going unnoticed because they don't have tits. If you are a drummer or musician and you have dreams, if that doesn't piss you off then I don't know what will.

Edit 2: yes we get it, if you try to make me look like an idiot you'll get upvoted.

1370249143.0,106,self.drums,1fkkk5,Wisdom for the aspiring professional drummer,116,10,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/drums/comments/1fkkk5/wisdom_for_the_aspiring_professional_drummer/,"Here is some wisdom I have gained in my relatively short 9 years of playing:


**1.) Practice with a metronome (whenever possible) at varying tempos:**

It is of the utmost importance that you dedicate part of your practice time to playing very slowly. This will help you to ""program"" your limbs through muscle memory and encourage good technique. This allows you to play with confidence and as little tension as possible when you speed up.

It is helpful to set tempo goals for any practice material, and achieve said goals by increasing tempo in incremental steps on your metronome.


**2.) Establishing Good Fundamental Technique:**

Good technique will save your equipment, and more importantly, your BODY from damage. Good Technique will also help maximize results and minimize downtime due to injury and stress. 

You are developing your ""sound"" and ""feel"" on your instrument, as they are basically the only things that separate you from a drum machine. Tone is as important on our instrument as it is for a woodwind player. Stay relaxed and breath while you play; stretch before!


**3.) Reading, listening, and learning to communicate with your drums:**

Music is a language. You should be both musically literate, and articulate as a part of today's music workforce. There is no easy way to develop your reading skills, so you must practice reading every day to ensure you are developing these assets. There are no short cuts. The more hard work and time you dedicate to your instrument and yourself will pay off.


**4.) Be organized, focused, and driven:**

Track your progress. Keep a spiral notebook for your practice routines to ensure that you are putting in adequate time to things you want to learn, and not wasting time on things you already know. This may seem like work, because it IS. You want this to be your job. Start working now and you will thank yourself later.

When you practice, it would behoove you to clear your mind and FOCUS. Think about the task at hand and nothing else. Down the road you will be playing gigs and inevitably you will have a bad day. If you let your emotions get the best of you, you may not get a call back. That's money out of your pocket, and possibly even bridges burned resulting in less gigs in the future.

Also, you will eventually come to doubt yourself on your quest. I think every professional musician I know has considered throwing in the towel and getting a 9-5 job. This is no easy task. You must have faith in yourself. You CAN do this, and if you are dedicated you WILL be a professional musician. How much money you make and your quality of life will be the fruits of your labor. So get to work!


**5.) Be yourself (that's what's really cool...) and save your $$$!**

When you interact with real, working musician's you are really just dealing with regular people. Do not try to be something you are not. Don't try with exceeding fervor to sound or look like someone who's playing you admire. Learn from them, and apply it to your own life/playing.

Stay healthy and avoid hard drugs, alcohol abuse, etc.
I know everyone has their own demons they must battle, but I'm just stating facts here. Heroin/Coke will more than likely not make you a better drummer, nor will it make you more fun or reliable to work with in a professional environment. Plus, let's be realistic: you cannot afford these things.

...and speaking of affording things. Have you ever noticed how expensive drum gear is? As a professional drummer you will be expected to have reliable, professional level gear. I won't go into detail with this now, but if you'd like I'll expand on that later.


Here are some practice materials that have helped me immensely:

**General Tips (;TLDR):**

Stay Healthy,
Find a good instructor,
Join your H.S. or a C.C. band,
Join a band, or be in one with your friends; attend jams/open mics,
Practice everyday no matter how you feel,
Save your $$; this will shit will get expensive,
YOUTUBE IS YOUR FRIEND,
Discipline is an acquired skill: cultivate it through practice,
Maintain good social relationships,
Set goals; destroy them,
Have fun with it,
Stretch,
Love life,

Hopefully some of you will find this helpful! If you have anything to add please do! We drummers need to stick together!

I love you /r/drums!

I grew up in Las Vegas, NV for most of my life and as such I was fortunate enough to typically be living in a house where I could play my acoustic drum set and practice with my band in my own home. When I moved to Los Angeles that all changed. I was living in a studio apartment on the first floor of a an 8 unit building and as such could not have my drum kit set up and be able to play it. 




To play with a band we had to rent hourly studios or sign a lease with a full lock out building far away and share it with other bands. All expensive and required lots of travel.
I solved this by purchasing a small entry line Roland V- Drum kit, a TD-6V.



The kit was nice, compact and the the aftermarket VEX kit add ons and VDrum library had some incredible sounds/features. I was playing it for almost 7 months when I got back behind my full DW kit again. What I thought was this; Holy shit I suck at playing a real kit. Everything is so far away and gigantic. 


I decided that playing a small V-drum kit was getting me into some bad habits when I'd play live with a real kit so I did the next best thing. I converted my DW kit to be like a Roland V-drum kit with mesh heads, rubber cymbals, and triggers. I found an even cheaper solution to get around paying for rental studios as well I’ll discuss in a second. 



The goal was to keep my acoustic Drum Workshop kit in my apartment, convert it to be mostly silent and then have my band mates over to my place to rehearse. This required a few things- a V-drum module, triggers, mesh heads, electronic cymbals, and finally some type of headphone hub we could all get the instruments into and hear with. 



So I ordered everything from RMC Audio; tAt the time of this write up the 14"" Roland mesh heads were on back order. I had decided to upgrade to a Roland TD-12 with all roland cymbals; CY-15 ride (x1), CY-14 crashes (x2), CY-8 china (x1), and VH-12 hi-hats.




Anyways; here is my progress through the conversion.



Here is the 4 pc Drum Workshop kit I'm starting with. There is a 22"" bass drum, 16"" suspended floor tom, 12"" suspended tom, and solid bronze DW 14"" snare.

All the items I've purchased from this conversion came from RMC Audio; They were fast, knowledgeable and had great pricing. I will be getting the rest of my items from them as well.

I decided to start with the bass drum.
Here we have 1 Hart 22"" mesh head, and the Roland RT-10K drum trigger.
[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/PixTU.jpg)



I started by removing both the batter and logo heads, the internal muffle pad and cleaned the shell inside and out. The logo head was a bit dirty with finger prints and dust, so I cleaned that as well.
[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/t2rto.jpg)



While everything was apart I tightened and checked all the hardware.
[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/xGUF5.jpg)



I then re-installed the front DW logo head and made sure to orientate the hoop so the split in the wrap would be on the bottom so it wouldn't show when the kit was assembled.

Next up I re-installed the foam muffle for the front head and to help make the mesh head less bouncy. 
[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/A82Bd.jpg)



Now for the Hart Dynamics 22"" mesh head installation; again I made sure to orientate the head and hoop so they would be aesthetically pleasing when set up to play.

Installing the RT-10K trigger and setting the trigger height was next. The package includes the single zone trigger, rim protectors (x2) stereo cable, and manual.
[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/q71fW.jpg)



I decided to mount the trigger on the bottom right to make sure there was no interference from the double bass pedal or linkage. I peeled the plastic off the clear hoop protectors and installed them on both sides of the hoop in my desired install spot.
[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/stJCu.jpg)



To install the RT-10K trigger you must loosen the mount all the way and use a drum key to loosen the trigger depth mount. Just install over the hoop and tighten the trigger.
[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/xjcwa.jpg)



You want the piezzo cone to be compressed 2-3mm when installed. You just push down slightly right in front of the cone and then tighten the mount while you leave your finger there. Release and watch the cone compress slightly. You are now done and can install the cable and setup your module.
[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/mDakv.jpg)

Here is the 12"" DW suspended tom, the pair of Roland 12"" mesh heads, and the RT-10T single zone trigger.
[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/pyFpI.jpg)



The process is the same for all of this stuff. Remove the old acoustic heads, clean the shell inside and out, tighten the hardware, install mesh heads, and trigger.

16"" suspended DW floor tom was up next. These are a pair of Hart Dynamics 16"" heads, and another Roland RT-10T trigger.

The finished product:

Electric:

To get it to this point I had to special order a DW remote cable hi hat bracket and mount to hang off the hi hat stand for the TD-12 module. It all works incredibly well once you spend time getting the head tension, and triggers settings dialed in. 



Once the conversion was finished we needed a way to all play together in silence in my apartment. I came across a product called the Jamhub. (We use the Greenroom version)
http://jamhub.com/products/greenroom.html
(These days we play at my guitarist’s house in his converted garage.)


It’s a silent rehearsal studio. 
What it does is take inputs from up to 6 different instruments and allow each user to have their own headphone mix of the entire band. If I want less bass I dial it back in my mix. If I want to hear mostly me, I crank myself up to give myself what I want. Essentially it stops volume wars with everyone turning themselves up to be louder to hear themselves better. We also have the ability to add a mic into each channel to talk to each other or record room ambience or a singer (if we had one.)



The device is really quite genius. 



When we do end up playing a show I just swap heads and trade out cymbals and I’m ready for a gig. About 1 hr to swap to an acoustic kit, and two hours to convert back to electronic. 
Here is my kit being set up at the Blizzard Entertainment 2012 Blizz Summerfest stage by a pro stage hand.
Acoustic:

The other bonus about playing electronically through the jamhub is grabbing a recorded practice with high sound quality through one of the 6 channels. We are a 3 pc instrumental band that plays post-surf rock and only need 3 of the 6 channels; we put put 1 to a HN4 recording device, the other 2 to a laptop running logic (to grab individual separated tracks) and use the direct out on the Roland module to grab drum tracks to the laptop. 



Here is one of our songs; The band is called The Ghosts of Searchlight, and the song is called Sixteen Weeks on Shadow Point. 
Jamhub:
http://soundcloud.com/ovalteens/shadowpoint-20120531
Live:
http://soundcloud.com/ovalteens/2012-blizz-summerfest-16-weeks



The first version is us practicing the song at home through the jamhub and using the electric drums, the second is playing live with all acoustic drums at a festival outdoors; pardon the wind noise on this recording.



Hope this helps some of you wondering how you can live quietly as a drummer.

Regardless of how you might feel about the game, it has a neat feature that makes it a valuable tool for real drummers.

For those of you who don't know how Rock Band works, here's some info.  The game uses master tracks for most songs.  It separates and isolates the audio between: Vocals, Drums, Bass, Guitar, and Keyboards.  When you fail to hit the corresponding note on the screen; the audio doesn't play for that note on your track.

Here's how RockBand is awesome.  (All of this is for Rock Band 3, but should also work with other entries in the series)

* In the pause menu, set ""No Fail Mode"" to the ""On"" position.  This means that the song won't fail out and stop no matter how many notes you miss.  And for this, you'll be missing a lot of notes.

* Disconnect the audio-out cable from your TV and plug it into the ""audio in"" port or microphone port on your computer.  You will most likely need an RCA-3.5mm adapter to do this.

* Open up an audio recording program.  I use [Audacity](http://audacity.sourceforge.net/), it's free, simple, and works great.

* Start recording.

*  Start the song on RockBand, but don't hit any notes.  If you've followed the instructions, the song will play without the drum track.

* When the song's over, stop the recording, clip the beginning and end of the song, and save to MP3.

* Play songs on headphones or stereo and jam away!

Using this method, I have built a library of over 100 drumless songs to play along to.  The best part is that they're songs I actually like and it's free! (if you already own the game, that is).

Rock Band has an awesome library of songs, and with this method you can play along to the songs how you want to, able to add your own style.  Hope someone here finds this useful, I think it's a neat way to utilize Rock Band.",,False,,t5_2qie5,False,,,True,t3_18l835,http://www.reddit.com/r/drums/comments/18l835/easy_way_to_make_playalong_tracks/,

Here's some from this morning. When spring comes around and my snare is done, I'll take it outside for some shots. I can stand on the shop to get some true overheads then. Anyways, here ya go! Best I can do for now.

http://imgur.com/a/3EleF

**Kit** is a 1968 Rogers kit. (Much like Darren King's, I'm his biggest fan, don't argue with me) Sizes: 20""x14"" kick, 16""x16"" floor, 12""x8"" rack.

**Snare** is a 1967 Ludwig Acrolite. Keystone badge. Fantastic all around snare. I have a home-built stave 13""x6.75"" on the way. Most of you have seen it.

**Hardware** is mostly DW, but before I head out this Summer I'm planning to upgrade it all. Stands will be DW 6000 flush base stuff, including the 3 snare snare stands I'll need. Pedals will both be Tama Speedcobras. Not sure if I'll go double or not yet. Probably will find a new throne sometime too. Also looking for an oriental rug, haha. If anybody knows a good place to find an oriental style rug for cheap, hit me up!

**Cymbals** left to right:
Meinl Byzance 14"" Extra Dry Medium Hats
Meinl Byzance 20"" Traditional Extra Thin Hammered Crash
Meinl Byzance 22"" Vintage Sand Ride
Meinl Byzance 21"" Traditional Medium Crash
Meinl Byzance 20"" Extra Dry Thin Crash

Also, my **cowbell** is a Meinl Hand-hammered. His name is Edwin. He is most important.


EDIT: Last photo some of you may recognize. Update on that, I've built the jig to round out the inside, hardware is ordered, but the single flange hoops and the George Way 845 throw off are on backorder.

22"" Paiste Signature Dry Heavy Ride (This thing is fucking DISCONTINUED!!!)

14"" Paiste Signature Dark Crisp Hats

19"" Sabian Paragon China


...and some random felts, a bell I made out of a paiste sig crash, and a clutch.  I'm so angry not knowing where they are, and thinking that the asshole might have just sold them as, scrap metal.  Knowing that may have been the fate of my dear dear ride, almost brings tears to my eyes.  And I have no idea what I'm gonna do for my gig tomorrow.  

I guess all I'm asking is that if anyone happens to come across the 22"" dry heavy ride online, please PM me.  I want that back so bad.  =(

I'm gonna cry myself to sleep now.

So anyway, what I've done is use their tuning calculator here:

http://www.tune-bot.com/tuningcalculator.aspx

To find which frequency the heads are supposed to be at. 

I then opened up a Dog-Whistle app on my phone, which allows you to punch in a specific frequency and then hear it when you tap the whistle, and tuned each head to the wanted frequency by ear.

Their default settings are relatively low pitches for the toms, so if you want them tuned higher, you can use their guide here:

http://www.tune-bot.com/drum-tuning.html

You'll have to do a little math, but they explain it very well, and then you can just use a tone generator or dog-whistle app to hear what frequency the heads should be at.",,False,,t5_2qie5,False,,,True,t3_14a3qy,http://www.reddit.com/r/drums/comments/14a3qy/an_easy_way_to_tune_your_toms_i_figured_out/,

I told him I was looking for new cymbals and he basically went though a lot of the products and he also explained that the reason some of the cymbals they have are so pricey is because of their tin content ( why b8's are called b8 due to the 8% tin content) and thus producing darker sounds. overall we talked for about ten minuets on our favorite cymbals and which ones he used and why, it was nice to be able to talk to a good employee like that. thanks zildjian! also, his name was Dave if anyone wants to know.",,False,,t5_2qie5,False,,,True,t3_zcugx,http://www.reddit.com/r/drums/comments/zcugx/so_i_contacted_zildjian_support_today/,

Should I just go fuck myself?",106,35,65,http://www.reddit.com/r/drums/comments/pxzha/rdrumporn_and_rdrumcovers_would_be_a_welcome/,"Perhaps it's just me, but jesus, I'm so tired of seeing all your drum kits and covers.  No offense to those who have posted, but I've seen drums before, and so I'm good there.   Yes, I see you've got a five piece kit with some cool cymbals.  Good for you.

When I got here, the subreddit was more for advice/instruction/questions/problems.  Now it's people who post really bad covers of really bad songs that their ""friends"" did.  I don't want to see that.  In fact, I have no interest in seeing that.  I can unsub, but I'd hate to miss out on the good stuff.

So, can someone create and mod /r/drumporn and [/r/drumcovers](/r/drumcovers) so we can move this type stuff over there.  Then we can change the rules here to reflect that? 

I mean, there was an image posted here recently where the guy still had the tags on his new Gretsch kit.  Like straight out of the store and set up in his living room.  I know what they look like, because I can see them in the store too.  Why do we need to see that?  What good does that do for any of us?

Does anybody really care to look at every single person's drum kit here?  Or hear bad metal cover after bad metal cover on a daily basis?  Can we direct that somewhere else?  Am I on an island here?  If I am, I'll happily go fuck myself.
