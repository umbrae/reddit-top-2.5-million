You dumb cunts have totally ruined my life. 

Here's how it was: three months ago I was a happy man. I had a good job, a girlfriend, a cat, and otherwise basically everything I needed to provide a comfortable, happy life for myself and the woman I intended to marry someday. We both have your OH SO PATHETIC, OMG HOW COULD YOU STEM DEGREES that  you bitches hate so much and we were both working good, decent jobs and we lived in a nice apartment, basically coming home from work every day to hang out and play video games or have sex or whatever. We were happy is my point.

Then she started reading your shit-slinging subreddit and you bitches taught her to hate men.

It started with her not liking video games any more. We were playing ME3, more or less together, taking turns being the one playing/watching (WOW I BET YOU'LL MAKE THAT SEXIST SOMEHOW, BTW) and she stopped wanting to play because EDI doesn't wear clothes...? Whatever, you feminazi cunts, she's a fucking robot, of course she doesn't wear clothes. She was made to inflitrate human society, so of course she's sexually attractive. You dumb bitches can't separate logic from real sexism AND YOU CORRUPTED HER WITH YOUR STUPIDITY. SHE WAS INNOCENT OF YOUR HATRED UNTIL YOU LIED ABOUT WHAT REAL WOMEN ACT LIKE, YOU FUCKING FEMINAZI BRABURNERS.

But it gets worse, right? Not only does she stop wanting to BOND, doesn't feel like she has to do ANY WORK in the relationship, but she starts bitching at every movie or TV show we watch, whining about how women wear sexy clothing (because only ugly women are real, hurr) or whatever, and starts doing nothing but reading your shit subreddit and whatever hateful anti-man books she can get her hands on. We were talking abotu having a kid someday, and suddenly she won't even hear about it because she's too good to someday give up her job to HAVE A CHILD LIKE A NORMAL FUCKING WOMAN.

Long story short she broke up with me last night. She's out with her friends right fucking now, probably looking for one of her lesbians to hook up with and leave me in the dust. But the fact is that this? This is why people on reddit hate you. You fucking bitches do nothing but teach women to hate good men and make life hard for us, and then don't sympathize when we're left behind just because we don't make $100K a year or whatever.

First, I see this problem everywhere, in every subreddit, this tendency to anthropomorphize reddit as a single entity. The problem with that is that it isn't. Some men like women with make up. Some men like women without make up. Some women like outspoken and confident men. Some women like men who are shy and sweet. Some men like women who will quietly obey them. Some men like women who will be their equal and partner. This is the nature of the game. There are posts that call Obama a saint and posts that call him the Antichrist. How can he be both?

Secondly, we were just as screwed up by the culture wars as you were. Both in our perception of you and our perception of ourselves. As a man I'm supposed to make enough money to support the family or I'm a failure, but I'm a misogynist if my wife is a stay at home mom. I'm supposed to be fit and cut and muscular, but I'm assumed to be a muscle bound  idiot if I get too big. I'm never supposed to cry, but I can't be emotionally unavailable. 

If I spent all my time trying to live up to society's ideal man, I would never be happy. So I gave up trying to please all women and decided to please one. My wife. So that's what all you women out there who get so worked up about gender roles and misogyny need to understand. Instead of trying to please all men, find one man that pleases you, and decided whether he's worth pleasing

And this brings me to my third an final point. It is NOT misogyny to want a certain kind of woman. There's nothing wrong with having standards, and there's nothing wrong with you if you decide I'm not worth the trouble of meeting those standards. That just means I don't meet yours. And it is NOT sexism to ask your partner to do things they wouldn't normally do. Sacrifice is part of any relationship and it goes both ways.

The long-story-short of this message is that the biggest shitlords here are you. Yes, I'm looking at you. You regulars of SRS are some of the worst fucking people I have ever had the morbid pleasure of observing. You see, every so often, I'll come across a group of people who manage to redefine my view of what constitutes the 'worst of the worst' on the internet. I'm posting here not because I want to make you angry, nor because I want to convince you of the error of your ways. In fact, in true SRS fashion, I am here to rant; I'm here to rant like an impotent and impetuous child because I am ashamed that you--under the guise feminism, an admirable movement that I consider myself a part of--have collectively managed to outdo all the religious fundamentalists and all the racist bigots with your unapologetic intolerance and childishness.

I suppose that a lot of my frustration stems from confusion. Why the fuck do you guys even exist? You clearly all think that Reddit is a terrible place. So why do you stick around? All you guys do is sit around and make each other angry. You literally have no mind toward improving Reddit--in fact, you expressly forbid it in your rules. What the fuck, SRS? It's beyond sad that so many of you have nothing better to do except stay on a site that you hate, actively seek out things that make you angry, and then post them to a forum to pile on the hate.

And if you're reciting to yourself that tired old excuse that this place is therapeutic, give it a fucking rest. Half your posts have trigger warnings on them. Everything on here is actually meant to make you angry--there is nothing therapeutic about that. You are a machine of counterproductive cynicism, and don't tell me otherwise, because I've fucking seen regulars talking about how the need a break from this place. Somehow, it never even occurs to them that that is a major indication that this place is unhealthy.

Unhealthy is an understatement. This place is a cesspool of unnecessary anger and self-pity. 

Tell me: has it ever crossed your mind that this place does more harm than good? Let's forget the fact that you stand on shaky ground when it comes to the psychological health of your actual members. How does SRS look from the outside?

I'll tell you exactly how it looks: insane. Completely, utterly insane.

I am not exaggerating. I'm not using ""insane"" to mean poorly-thought-out or stupid or disagreeable. I am literally telling you that to an outsider, it is at first very, very hard to believe that the average SRS member does not suffer from some form of mania. The constant references to male genitalia, the lazy satire, the way every goddamn thread plays out in exactly (once again, I am not being hyperbolic; I truly mean exactly) the same way--and my god, the sheer childishness of it all! Do you think that you're shocking someone with your phallic emoticons? Do you think that you're actually making fun of someone with the art in your sidebar, or the bad spelling and grammar? Sometimes, things happen on such a scale that only understatement can properly convey their enormity. And this is such a case, where I am deserted by all other words and can only say that you, as a community, are immature. Immature and childish. 

Don't get me wrong--it's your right to act this way. It's not as though there aren't a thousand other subreddits that are at least close to as immature as yours (though I hesitate to agree that there are any that actually surpass your impressive immaturity). But it never seems to cross anyone's mind that this is bad for the image of feminism on the internet. What is someone supposed to think when they come here? Sure, some of them get sucked in and become regulars. But the vast majority of them revile you. You are hated. For the third time, I feel the need to say outright that I am not exaggerating. All of Reddit loathes you. Your most-upvoted thread of all time is one that blasts you and calls you out for your ridiculousness. That is a special dishonor that few subreddits can match. And every person who comes across here and reacts badly is that much more likely to dismiss feminism and act in precisely the manner that you all so profoundly hate. 

Don't tell me that reasonable people will embrace your message, because believe me, they won't. The vast majority of the things submitted to this shithole are harmless jokes. Your sense of superiority over the people who tell these jokes--or, indeed, the people who receive them without throwing a preachy tantrum--is insufferable. Yes, sometimes these jokes are off-color, but that means nothing in today's society. Do you stand up in protest at the offensive jokes told during a roast? Then why the fuck would you do the same here? What you don't understand is that the basis for the overwhelming majority of these ""racist"" or ""sexist"" jokes is not discrimination but solidarity. The internet promotes unity, and this unity makes people comfortable with this type of joke. All you do is disrupt this unity and make people uncomfortable. You don't point out the elephant in the room; you fucking construct it out of paper straws and fight tooth and nail to stop anyone from knocking it down. And that drives reasonable people away from you and away from your cause. 

And the worst part is simply how spiteful you all are. People who are at worst slightly ignorant (but far more likely simply making a harmless joke) become the target of absolutely ludicrous quantities of hatred here. And the hatred isn't limited to their ""misogyny""--no, you all, without exception, resort to personal and totally uncalled-for insults.

Never in my life have I called a woman a cunt. It is not something that I will be comfortable with; but I'll be damned if I wasn't tempted to apply that term to you, SRS. And don't pretend that that makes me worse than you, because it doesn't. You bitch and whine when people use gendered slurs against women, but have no problem with constantly shouting about how Reddit is filled with sexually inept neckbeards. Fucking wake up, SRS. Only a man can be a neckbeard, and believe it or not, that's a fucking gendered slur. Didn't seem so bad using it all the time, did it? Well that's how the whole world feels when it uses the word 'bitch' to describe women like you. 

I was wrong earlier; this is mostly a rant, but it's more than that. I know that this will not be read by the general SRS population. In fact, I know that it will mostly likely only be read by one mod before being removed, and perhaps that single mod won't even read it all the way through. But that doesn't matter to me, because I am a feminist, and I do not like the idea of people like you lumping yourselves together with people like me on a community as large as Reddit. 

So I'll post this more than once. I won't inundate you with spam, though I very easily could. No, instead I'll only submit it every couple weeks, maybe every couple months. My hope is that at some point, a mod will read it all the way through before deleting it. If that happens, I don't know what will follow--but I wish that maybe something here will strike a chord with them, and they could change something. 

Good day, SRS. May this message find you well. ",,False,,t5_2s4m9,False,,,True,t3_vk5e3,http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/vk5e3/effort_shit_shit_everywhere/,
1353978015.0,868,self.ShitRedditSays,13ufh3,[Effort] What makes Gina a Good Girl?,1175,307,305,http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/13ufh3/effort_what_makes_gina_a_good_girl/,"Meet [Greg](http://www.quickmeme.com/Good-Guy-Greg/). Greg is an Advice Animal (loosely speaking, anyway). Greg is a Good Guy. Ostensibly he's an example of little things people do that make life better - things like [making sure people are comfortable](http://i.qkme.me/3pha3b.jpg). However, some people felt that there should be a woman equivalent to Greg. And so, [Gina](http://www.quickmeme.com/Good-Girl-Gina) was born.

Logically Gina's main purpose would be to demonstrate situations where a girl rather than a guy did something nice, or where the good deed is gender-specific. Since Redditors are logical people, she became a pretty standard and inoffensive meme. Actually that last part was a lie, as I'll demonstrate.

After seeing what I thought was the hundredth Gina who cooked breakfast after giving a guy a blowjob while he smoked a joint and played Nintendo, I decided to try and capture the essence of the meme. I scraped the information from every Gina meme uploaded to quickmeme up until September 27, 2012. From there, I categorized each one as one or more of the following:

**Sexualized or objectified:** Gina is presented as a sex object, a prize to be attained, etc. Maybe [she helps out during sex](http://i.qkme.me/3pkrjl.jpg). Or perhaps she [performs impromptu oral sex](http://i.qkme.me/3ou3af.jpg). Or even if the submitter isn't actively having sex with her, [she's still a target for lust](http://i.qkme.me/3pkmv7.jpg)


**Performs oral sex:** [This is pretty straightforward](http://i.qkme.me/3p2qip.jpg). There's the occasional lesbian submission, though they're few and far between and I don't know if they're jokes.


**Has anal sex:** [Again, fairly straightforward](http://i.qkme.me/3q61qm.jpg).


**References to her period:** A noticeable minority of GGG submissions contained references to her period. Typically these involved [her providing sexual pleasure](http://i.qkme.me/3pkfcz.jpg) or sometimes [disappearing altogether](http://i.qkme.me/3pknry.jpg) because hey, women are only good for sex, right? (Note: this category is only instances where periods are mentioned. A few aren't derogatory.)


**Sexually gratifies someone:** Gina gratifies someone sexually. [Maybe she doesn't want to](http://i.qkme.me/3qziz7.jpg) or [maybe she suggests it herself](http://i.qkme.me/3opy0e.jpg). Or perhaps [she acts as a masturbation aid](http://i.qkme.me/3pl0xu.jpg). Regardless, she's helping someone get their rocks off.


**Making sure she (or someone else) is sexually available:** Sometimes Gina doesn't want to have sex, [but still performs her wifely duty](http://i.qkme.me/3qzk8m.jpg). Other times [she'll give you nudes](http://i.qkme.me/3p1ns0.jpg). She also doesn't care about being [stalked](http://i.qkme.me/3q1wom.jpg) or [leered at](http://i.qkme.me/3p4o2i.jpg). And if there's nothing she can do, maybe she can [provide another woman](http://i.qkme.me/3p69cy.jpg).


**Policing her dating and sex life:** First and foremost, [she doesn't put you in the dreaded Friendzone](http://i.qkme.me/3pkmv7.jpg). She dates men who are [Reddit-approved](http://i.qkme.me/3oneo9.jpg). And of course if she's taken [she makes it clear](http://i.qkme.me/3pzqv7.jpg), because her top priority is informing others about her relationship. And that's [in all situations](http://i.qkme.me/3qm9jb.jpg), by the way. Oh, and [she's not being devious about it](http://i.qkme.me/3p1rpe.jpg). She also [doesn't cheat](http://i.qkme.me/3p2ptz.jpg) the second her significant other is away (nb: after reading all of these memes, I can only assume this is a natural female impulse).


**Uses approved media or approves of it:**. Gina [shares your taste in video games](http://i.qkme.me/3prs99.jpg). She [also won't submit you to her interests](http://i.qkme.me/3pj5pq.jpg).


**Takes part in or approves of your lifestyle:** This one is more oriented to weed and booze. She [brings her own weed](http://i.qkme.me/3qplk7.jpg), [buys you beer](http://i.qkme.me/3pks3z.jpg), and [nurses you back to health from a hangover](http://i.qkme.me/3pgs06.jpg).


**She isn't a stereotype:** Unlike all those other girls, [she dates Nice Guys](http://i.qkme.me/3pkmw7.jpg). [She doesn't think she's fat](http://i.qkme.me/3qko5g.jpg). [She doesn't fake being upset](http://i.qkme.me/3qdz1z.jpg), and [realizes there was no reason for that anyway](http://i.qkme.me/3pkt7k.jpg). [She's not indecisive](http://i.qkme.me/3pkpg7.jpg), and she [leaves the toilet seat up](http://i.qkme.me/3qhcqp.jpg). (Seriously you have no idea how often those last two came up. Goddamnit reddit get better jokes.)


**She doesn't rock the boat:** Did Gina break up with her boyfriend? It's hard to tell because [she's not talking about it on Facebook](http://i.qkme.me/3osnrv.jpg). Her lunch is [also not on Facebook](http://i.qkme.me/3qizdn.jpg). Nor is [her latest hairstyle](http://i.qkme.me/3qctem.jpg). [She certainly won't](http://i.qkme.me/3qsdbc.jpg) [self-identify as a nerd](http://i.qkme.me/3qoc54.jpg). And she definitely won't commit the cardinal sin of [identifying herself as a woman](http://i.qkme.me/3opevy.jpg).


**Provides food or drink:** And of course, Gina [makes dinner](http://i.qkme.me/3p2me9.jpg). [And sandwiches](http://i.qkme.me/3q2jg9.jpg).


**Other horrible shit:** Some submissions make [casual use of slurs](http://i.qkme.me/3qe9jj.jpg). [Sometimes submissions are just terrible (TW).](http://i.qkme.me/3p9er6.jpg)

Here are some graphs for you to enjoy. The weighted statistics are weighted by the view count on quickmeme's website, which I feel is a rough proxy for karma (ie a higher view count implies the submission received more karma). The unweighted statistics might be prone to duplicate entries.

So what can we glean from all this? If someone wants to be a Good Girl, then reddit already has it figured out. A Good Girl is an object to be lusted after. A Good Girl makes sure you're sexually satisfied, either by her or someone else. A Good Girl defies stereotypes, unless they play into your desires, like when she cooks for you. A Good Girl plays your video games and watches your movies, and she'll bring you food and drinks and drugs, but a Good Girl won't talk about any of those things, because she is a Good Girl.

You guys do nothing for you cause. If all you do is poke at and piss at the most trivial jokes, you are NOT helping your cause. If you put down men and whites in some attempt to make them know ""how it feels,"" you are NOT helping your cause. And if you think butting your head into every conversation that doesn't concern you, you are NOT helping your goddamn cause.

I get it: you're all butthurt, but you can circle around your little group and all share in the delusion that you're really some expert trolls who are just putting Redditors in their place. Fortunately for you, one is unable to read body language over the Internet, so when your lip quivers at someone making the slightest joke about women, or your nose ruffles when you hear someone slamming obese people, no one knows how butthurt you really are. Except me. I know because I'm not fucking stupid and have been around shits like you all my life.

I consider myself a progressive, but you're hurting everyone in this way. Learn to grow up and handle things like an idiot instead of spamming your overdone gifs of your fat bird, as if it's some clever instrument for telling people off. Just because you have your own group applauding your sarcastic and demeaning tone when arguing with a ""shitlord,"" doesn't mean that you make a good point. You guys are so caught up in each other, you don't even debate the others because you have the larger audience, and therefore know you'll ""win.""

I could write a lot more, but I just wanted you guys to know that what you're doing is harmful to progressives everywhere. I'm not some fat ""beardmad neckbeard"" either. I'm 5'11,"" 210 pounds, 12-13% bodyfat, and I can bench almost 315 pounds. So no, I have no problem getting girls. And no, I don't objectify or oversexualize them just because I make jokes about their womanness or comment on their attractiveness in picture threads. I'm just being a human instead of trying to fight it to seem morally superior. The first thing we see in anyone is appearance, can you blame us for judging someone like that when it's the only thing we know about them?

Tl;dr: You guys aren't helping yourselves. You're only further convincing each other and driving everyone else away.

Edit: So since your own admins can't stop me from posting (banning me doesn't mean I can no longer edit this message), let me address one last thing:

I never said whites or men were oppressed. I never fucking said that and yet, you're saying I did...? I just said picking on them is stupid and doesn't help your cause. You guys are so quick to jump on oppression when not everything is exactly perfect but freely extend it to the groups you don't like. No, whites and men are not necessarily oppressed, which is exactly why I didn't say it. All you guys can do is use strawmen arguments and attack in swarms, because you might actually feel like you're not right about everything otherwise. Why not take on people by yourself? Why do you have to recruit your whole fucking battalion like it's too much on your own? It's just... amazing that you guys can't realize that everyone else thinks you guys are wrong.

Edit 2: I only told you guys how much I can bench so you couldn't call me some pathetic fat idiot. I am very much physically equipped, at least the 9s and 10s that approach me think so. If I didn't tell you how much I could bench, you'd all just continue making strawman arguments about me being fat (which is only bad if it you're a man according to you guys), so I just had to get that out. It's a double-edged sword; I'll get criticized either way.

Edit 3: I made a new thread to point out just what happened after the creation of this one, only to have the admins quickly delete it and ban my second account on here. Here is what it stated:

[Link to the original thread, ""Shit Shit Reddit Says Says.""](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/1cdhv1/shit_shit_reddit_says_says/)

I made a thread on this subreddit recently condemning the actions of Shit Reddit Says and was met with much ridicule. I yielded a number of responses that poked fun at me publicly, but privately it was a whole different story...

I was bombarded with private message after private message of posters continually calling me fat, gay, pathetic, stupid, with many suggesting I should kill myself. Please know that I meant no ill-will by what I posted on here and only meant the best (at the very least, I think you can all agree that I'm not a harmful person). 

Though many people here seem to actively fight bullying, it seems to be a different story when no one else can see what they're saying. I do believe many of you mean well-I really do-but I hope that you find what you see detestable regardless of how much you may detest me. There's a lot more than what I included in the link below, but this should give you a good taste of the kind of attacks I received.

Those in charge of this subreddit, I am willing to hand over the names of the abuse and have you do to them what you please. This post is not meant to shame your subreddit or the many members it holds; rather, it seeks to publicize what was meant to be kept private. This is the quiet side of things, but very real verbal abuse all the same.

Reddit.com is a social website that allows its user to share and discuss content such as videos, photos, articles, websites, and so on.

Reddit is massively popular (http://blog.reddit.com/2012/01/2-billion-beyond.html), especially with young people (http://en.reddit.com/r/misc/comments/nevz9/results_of_the_reddit_demographics_survey_in_pie/).

Reddit is split into subcommunities known as ""subreddits,"" meaning that while reddit exists as a website, it consists of the sum of its subcommunities. People can subscribe to each community and participate by sharing and commenting.

Unfortunately, the reddit community as a whole also harbors and caters to pedophiles, distributors of child pornography, rapists, peeping Toms, and sex offenders. 

Last fall, Anderson Cooper aired a report exposing the child pornography hosted on the site, ultimately leading to the largest subreddit devoted to it being shut down. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuMdQRRLoYg&amp;feature=related  http://www.reddit.com/r/jailbait

Dozens of subreddits took its place. 

Reddit users, as well as people in the media, have criticized Reddit's permissive attitude towards child exploitation. Unfortunately, while admins didn't ban sexualized images of children on paper until last February (http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2012/02/policy-shift-reddit-bans-child-pornography.html), the rule remains unenforced, indicating that they are more interested in shielding themselves from bad press than protecting innocent kids.

A list of ""jailbait"" (child porn) forums that are currently on reddit:

* girlsinschooluniforms
* volleyballgirls
* TeenSex
* realteens
* LatinaJailbait
* MidgetJailbait
* johnnybait
* FirstRight
* Underage
* Jail_bait
* Jailbaits
* NSFW_JAILBAIT_TUBE
* PregnantJailbait
* PhotoPlunder
* FacebookCleavage
* japanese_idols
* AngieVerona


Some of these forums are hidden and invite only which makes it impossible to know how many actually exist.

The owners of reddit know there is active trading of child porn on their forums and refuse to do anything about it. Any reports are deleted and ignored. Further, Reddit's cofounder simply dismisses the issue and blames the exploited children whose pictures are being traded: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXZYvrue1BE

Included in the Anderson Cooper report was the statement by Reddit General Manager Erik Martin which defends the child pornography remaining on the site: ""We’re a free speech site and the cost of that is there’s offensive stuff on there … Once we start taking down some things we find offensive, then we’re no longer a free speech site and no longer a platform for everyone. We’re exerting editorial control and that’s not what we are."" http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2012/02/policy-shift-reddit-bans-child-pornography.html




The former leader of the child pornography rings, Violentacrez, is often in direct contact with the owners of the site. Erik Martin (aka hueypriest) went so far as to warn Violentacrez before reluctantly making the announcement last February. http://pastebin.com/eWhyDXCH

&gt;(4:03:13 PM) hueypriest: want to give you a heads up

&gt;(4:04:00 PM) hueypriest: we're making a policy change regarding jailbait type content. Don't really have a choice.

Reddit also has subreddits which publish images of women's and underage girls' private areas, including ""upskirt"" and ""downblouse"" pictures, without the knowledge or consent of their subjects. The users of these subreddits trade tips on how to stalk and photograph women and minors and encourage each other to go out and take more such pictures.

A list of these forums currently on Reddit include:

* CreepShots
* Upskirt
* Downblouse
* yogapants
* Voyeur

A majority of these images are of girls in high school classroom settings.

Creepshots' FAQ states:
""Creepshots are CANDID. If a person is posing for and/or aware that a picture is being taken, then it ceases to be candid and thus is no longer a creepshot. A creepshot captures the natural, raw sexiness of the subject without their vain attempts at putting on a show for the camera. That is the essence of the creepshot, that is what makes a true creepshot worth the effort and that is why this sub-reddit exists.""

One user, called SFJohnny, secretly video tapes himself raping and beating hundreds of women and girls, and shares them on reddit. http://i.imgur.com/1Hkpt.png

Not only is this all of this disgusting, it's illegal as per the Video Voyeurism Act of 2004.

&gt;Whoever, in the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States, has the intent to capture an image of a private area of an individual without their consent, and knowingly does so under circumstances in which the individual has a reasonable expectation of privacy, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than one year, or both.


Other forums are explicitly devoted to filming sexual assaults and sharing them on reddit as pornography for other users. These include:

* RapingWomen
* RapingTrannies
* StruggleFucking
* AbusePorn
* BeatingTrannies
* BeatingWomen


Sick to your stomach yet? Here's more awful Reddit things:

* A pedophile's confession -http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/mz0au/iama_man_who_at_24_met_a_14_yr_old_girl_and_lost/
* Thousands of rapists being supported by the community -http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/jul/29/rapist-confessions-reddit
* A subreddit called ""seduction"" devoted to teaching men how to rape women 
* A subreddit called ""Incest"" devoted to child molestation
* A subreddit called ""Pics of Dead Kids""

**WHAT DO WE DO WITH THIS?!**


Reddit is the most popular with college aged asshats in the US. Lots o' colleges have a black list for websites that contain child pornography or illegal material. Find as many emails for schools as you can and mass email this sucker out.

Act Local. If you're in America, I bet there's 20 churches near your home. Each church could have around 100 CONCERNED PARENTS that go to PTA meetings and talk to other parents. Send the ""Redditbomb"" to local politicians and churches. Let them see that their children are using a website that exploits and sexualizes children.

You can send tips to the FBI all day (god knows I do), but I think a grassroots campaign could do wonders.

Do you know how BORING local news is? Can you imagine if your local news could run a ""IS YOUR CHILD POSTING IN A PEDOPHILE WEBSITE? STATISTICALLY THERE'S AN 80% CHANCE!"" story? Holy shitballs they'd be all over it.

**Project PANDA distribution list**

Churches, PTAs, Schools

* Act Local send it to nearby high schools and churches. If you're in America, there's easily 20 churches near your home. Each church will have 30 to several thousand parents that go to PTA meetings and talk to other parents. Send the it to local politicians schools and churches. Let them see that their children are using a website that exploits and sexualizes children.

You act extremely aggressively to anything that is anti-anything, then when people complain, you insult/turn away/say that they are crying.

I mean, I'm not even mad, I just pity you guys, since you are all so disillusioned about the world, to think that everything everyone says is serious, and not in jest.

And even when something is said seriously, you guys don't look at both sides, you look at which ever you enjoy. I don't do this, I look at both sides.

I'm going to guess that 90% of you are

* female/gay male
* white
* middle class
* at least high school education, but most likely in college/out of college (with a degree in liberal arts)
* 22-32
* really got upset with #occupyanything
* libertarian

I feel sorry for you guys. I mean, just earlier, I saw a comment that an ""SRSer should date another SRSer"", which is ironic. You plead for equality, then act better than everyone else and only want to associate with others of the same mind.

Bracing for ""you're such a baby, go cry, you're so dumb"" instead of any logical arguments.

**SPOILER**: There's no reason to act like this.

As for the actual question: How can you guys do this in a serious manner? I'm *not* trying to undercut importance of equality (although it'd take a world revolution/apocalypse/catastrophe to have everyone be equal, just saying). But you guys are like ostriches - do whatever you want, run around, stir shit up, then anytime someone asks anything about you, you ignore it and wait for it to go away.

Why aren't you guys going apeshit over things in 4chan? They are usually sexist/racist, but you choose to trawl Reddit. 

Let me answer that for you: they wouldn't care. Reddit gives you a name, and with a name comes a reputation. But 4chan is anonymous. So anything you guys would say would get ignored.

*Today, Destiny was dropped from his team. Here's an excerpt from the press statmenet from ROOT*




&gt;In the last incident that Steven was involved in not long ago, our sponsors received a lot of negative feedback through e-mail about the whole situation, when it comes to Steven, we know that this isn't the first or the last time this will happen. The Chatlog wasn't pretty and it brought us a lot of negative publicity. It also, obviously, doesn’t reflect the opinions of our entire team and even though I believe it’s just silly talk between friends and it should be a private matter, we can't remotely agree or celebrate some of the things said in it, for this reason, TT1 and Fayth are receiving a warning and will be suspended from participating in clanwars and internal team activities for a month or more.
&gt;As a team that is trying to grow and become a respectable organization in a growing industry; a team that was created and is ran by professional gamers, situations like this hurt us and our future chances of success. Our current sponsors were very understanding of the situation and for that I thank them. But that is not to say doors won't close in the future because of previous incidents. If you've ever worked in a restaurant, say, as a waiter, you will know how much bigger of a deal it is to have negative feedback and someone telling the manager or writing a letter to the ownership of the restaurant about you being a crappy waiter than to have someone commend you on how great you are doing.

&gt;We release Steven today because there are 25+ people working hard every day to make ROOT grow and we don't want their efforts to be in vain. We release Destiny today because as selfish as it may sound, I'd rather release Steven today than disband our team tomorrow due to lack of financial support.

Like someone else pointed out, Stephano gets arrested but he's untouchable because he places well at tournaments. Destiny could be making a comeback, but in the midst of all the personal issues Destiny is going through, dealing with all the other fallout from MLG, his team of FRIENDS doesn't even support him through it.

*More doubt that this could possibly have been about his actions:*

[""If only Alex Garfield didn't equip every internet bottom dweller with the powerful information of what to do to immediately disrupt people's professional status in gaming.
Certainly Destiny did something bad here, but I would be pretty surprised to see that the people who reached out to the sponsors were honestly offended and not just long-time Destiny haters jumping on an opportunity.
The inability of anyone to grow from mistakes without being punished severely in this space is becoming quite scary. This particular instance already had plenty of its own native punishment without losing your team as well.

She responds by posting pictures of his dick, angering his fans. Destiny again responds, this time threatening to contact her school and get her financial aid cut.",784,262,313,http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/ytijd/effortpost_starcraft_2_player_steve_bonnell_aka/,"There is a well-known Starcraft 2 player, Steven Bonnell, also known as 'Destiny' who has been caught up in a rather disgraceful scandal, causing him to pull out of a MLG championship. Despite having a girlfriend, he took advantage of a *much* younger fan known as 'Bluetea', and then shared naked pictures of her with his friends calling her, amongst other names 'Shrek' and 'Butterface'.

Understandably feeling humiliated, she somehow was able to gain access to his Twitter account where she then leaked dick pictures he had been sending her. In her own words, and [from this thread ([+14] but she deleted her account)](http://www.reddit.com/r/destiny/comments/yt1a8/to_spare_erin_heres_whats_going_on/)

&gt; I'll come out and say this is Bluetea. I really have nothing to lose.
Long story short, Steven leaked nude pictures of me to his Skype friends. He then joked about how ""fucking hideous"" my face is compared to my ""beautiful body."" They joked about how I look like Shrek. I do have a big nose, I guess.

&gt; Someone who apparently was in the chat room emailed me from a gmail account consisting of a bunch of random numbers. It had the chat log.

&gt; When I confronted him about it, he first feigned ignorance. When it became clear he was then just going to ignore me, I snapped. I had his email password from when I used to help schedule his lessons. I changed his email password, which enabled me to change his Twitter and Skype passwords. I have a folder full of dick picks and, because I am so nice, tried to choose the most flattering to post.

&gt; My actions resulted from the build-up of many things he's done to me that I don't have time to mention, but his betrayal of my trust was the last straw. I hope you enjoy his penis.

&gt; TL;DR - Don't leak nudes of me because I will steal your Twitter and post pictures of your dick.)

How does Steven Bonnell respond?

[By threatening to contact her work and school so he can get her scholarships and financial aid removed [+75]](http://www.reddit.com/r/Destiny/comments/yt1a8/to_spare_erin_heres_whats_going_on/c5yk784)

&gt;Was to two people***, not an entire chat room of people, two people that I consider pretty close friends.

&gt; I never feigned ignorance, just didn't want to get into it right before an MLG.

&gt; I can't imagine how you can think that people will never, ever, ever talk about anything personal or private amongst their friends. Maybe I'm just stupid, but I can't see myself caring at all if you shared pictures between your close friends, especially given the fact that I'd never see any of them in real life.

&gt; Glad you think you have a right to every single private conversation I ever have, though. Posting pictures of my dick to 37k people + cutting me off from access to my e-mail/twitter is probably reasonable payback for me discussing something personal with two friends.

&gt; **Thanks for the new work location, I wonder what your boss will think of this. Or your dean, for that matter. I wonder if it'd affect your scholarship or financial aid?**

[Imgur screenshot in case he deletes his comment](http://i.imgur.com/S8CqU.png)

The thread itself is full of his fans coming out with comments like this

[1: ""Umm Bluetea is a slut [+63]](http://www.reddit.com/r/Destiny/comments/yt1a8/to_spare_erin_heres_whats_going_on/c5yk88u)

[2: He insulted her behind closed doors in a private chat log nobody would ever see. She insulted him to the entire internet. Yeah, that's fair [+21]](http://www.reddit.com/r/Destiny/comments/yt1a8/to_spare_erin_heres_whats_going_on/c5ykuez)

And of course, no SRS thread would be complete without the obligatory calling-a-woman-a-cunt, even when the guy is completely in the wrong, in this case, because he has to pull out of his match:

[3: We'd be pissed if he didn't play since he's doing so well, **and even if he lost because of this cunt,** then we'll know he at least tried his best. [+22]](http://www.reddit.com/r/Destiny/comments/yswyt/a_plea_to_the_public/c5ykjo6)

And to top it all off, his poor girlfriend is brought out to protect him, partially because of a case of mistaken identity, as some people think she leaked the sick pictures. Her name is /u/Erisann [and she responds in this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/Destiny/comments/yswyt/a_plea_to_the_public/) coming to his defence.

How does she feel about the fact her boyfriend is showing dick pictures of himself to his female Starcraft fans?

[Even she doesn't know [+11]](http://www.reddit.com/r/Destiny/comments/yswyt/a_plea_to_the_public/c5ym8iq)

**tl;dr** Guy shares nude pictures of a female fan and calls her Shrek and Butterface, she responds by posting his dick pictures on Twitter, he threatens to call her school and work and get her school scholarship and financial aid cut, his fans rush to his defence.

**UPDATE:**

Destiny has created [this new thread currently at [+17]](http://www.reddit.com/r/Destiny/comments/ytouh/as_cool_as_this_is/)

Of particular interest are his exchanges to cattypakes who asks [why do people defend you? [-9]](http://www.reddit.com/r/Destiny/comments/ytouh/as_cool_as_this_is/c5ypoh6). Steve Bonnell responds and then eventually makes it clear that he is [indeed very much determined to get 'just punishment' [+6]](http://www.reddit.com/r/Destiny/comments/ytouh/as_cool_as_this_is/c5ypwxi):

&gt; It's not about ""teaching someone a lesson"", it's just punishment. I'm pretty sure what she did was illegal on quite a few levels, and the fact that it's damaging to a business that I use to support my family makes me a little less willing to ""turn the other cheek"".

&gt; Yeah, I acted pretty scumbaggish and shared her picture with a couple friends. But for her to leak a bunch of shit to 40k people? Why on earth wouldn't I share that with her employer and school when she tried to effectively destroy my livelihood?

This should be a happy occasion, but honestly, my reaction is much more ambivalent. Rather than the reddit admins taking responsibility for what happens in their community, CreepShots is gone because [someone doxxed and blackmailed their top mod](http://i.imgur.com/AL52y.png).

It's hard not to see the irony in CreepShots being shut down over privacy concerns, and it's encouraging that having an online account that traffics in child exploitation is becoming a bigger and bigger liability.  But this isn't time to call it a day and rest on our laurels. Project PANDA isn't about threatening people in real life, it's about appealing to their basic human decency.

Unfortunately, with few exceptions, the admins have held fast to their do-nothing approach towards pRedditors, which means there will be a replacement /r/CreepShots within days, and the cycle of exploitation will go on.

So if you're reading this and thinking that you can ""help"" by doing stuff like this in the future - don't.  We have a lot more to lose in a doxxing war than the creeps do, and it's no substitute for pressing the admins to make structural changes, which is what we have been doing, and will keep doing. 

If you want to do your part, keep spreading the word about [Project PANDA](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/1006qd/meta_project_panda_the_fuckredditbomb/), and help the [coverage that's already out there](http://jezebel.com/5943873/reddit-users-go-rogue-revolt-against-sick-child-porn-forums) go viral. Let's give the admins a choice: take a courageous stand against predators in our community, or get used to having people say ""oh, you mean that creepy jailbait site?"" when you tell them what you do for a living.

1348946713.0,387,self.ShitRedditSays,10ofpb,"[Effort Post] [TW] User steelbender0 posts illegal pictures of ""pilled out sister in law"", admits to raping her",521,134,180,http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/10ofpb/effort_post_tw_user_steelbender0_posts_illegal/,"*(Cross-post from [r/creepshaming](http://www.reddit.com/r/creepshaming/comments/10nv53/tw_steelbender0_posts_illegal_pictures_of_pilled))*

**User steelbender0 has repeatedly engaged in criminal behavior. In the past, he has taken illegal pictures of a woman and posted them to r/creepshots. In a recent post, he admits to raping her.**

----------------------------------------------------------------

[User steelbender0's first post](http://www.reddit.com/r/CreepShots/comments/ygyyq/pilled_out_sister_in_law_creepshhhh/) was published a month ago. The pictures show a scantily clad woman fast asleep inside a private residence. According to the post title, she is his sister-in-law and she is apparently drugged.

These photos violate the ""reasonable expectation of privacy"" clause in most laws regarding candid photography. And, as if to humiliate this woman further, steelbender0 also posts clear images of her face in the comments.

[Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/Siu2f.png)

The users of /r/creepshots rewarded steelbender0's immoral, illegal, and downright frightening behavior with +155 upvotes and much positive feedback.

- Users frasier_crane, dj00713, and fap2u4u thank and congratulate steelbender0 for violating his sister in law.

- Users sanchop69, fap2u4u, and rr_cali ask for more pictures. FanboyChumChum thinks steelbender0 should have taken (also illegal) downblouse photographs. Zenike asks for video.

- Users treytable and FuckAllTheWomen actually tell steelbender0 he should sexually assault this woman the next time she's asleep.

Only two users express any qualms about what happened to this woman. Everyone else is treating her as though she were a buffet table. It is horrifying.

----------------------------------------------------------------

Tragically, it seems that the positive feedback from r/creepshots users encouraged steelbender0 to repeat and even escalate his crimes. [Steelbender0 again posted illegal images of his sister-in-law](http://www.reddit.com/r/CreepShots/comments/10nc3a/pilled_out_sister_in_laws_a/)  today. (The moderators removed the post, though the pictures, etc. are still up.)

[Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/1XYFL.png)

**Besides once again taking and publishing illegal photographs of this woman, steelbender0 admits to raping her while she was drugged**:

&gt;I don't drug her, she does it herself. That's the best part about it. I'll tell you this because I know a lot of redditors won't catch this here. She is horny and so am I. So shit, if she wants to give me the pus when she's experiencing euphoria why the fuck not????????? Yeah yeah her sister just stepped out for a few minutes to go get milk??? Kill me!!. Otherwise get rid of this sub reddit. Or give me props and let me continue what I am doin, I aint killin anyone ya herd???

**The images are apparently from a video steelbender0 made of himself assaulting this woman**:

&gt;That photo came from a 3 minute long video where I had some good fun...Trying to keep the party rolling if you know what I mean and she's down! fo sho! CREEEEP!~ While the girlfriend is away.

Further down:

&gt;I did fuck the shit out of her though if you really must know. Feel free to tell her sister.

Several users express disgust, but others don't seem to think there's anything wrong. Kruppeh and rubberwellies demand access to the rape video. SickestPuppy actually gives steelbender0 advice on equipment he can use to secretly videotape this woman again. **These men are validating and enabling criminal behavior**

Steelbender0 is completely unabashed about his crimes. What's truly alarming is that it seems that **he did all of this for the approval of the r/creepshots community**. He states:

&gt;Yall give me the proper votes...I'll get the goodness. Fuck that dumb shit, I honestly would rather be sneaking around the house without my iphone and having fun, but I'm gettin this shit for yalls!

He promises that he'll post the video of him raping his sister-in-law if he gets enough upvotes (perhaps he was inspired by [this incident](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/zkk52/tweffort_post_i_am_a_consumer_of_prostitution/)):

&gt;I will post the video if this gets what ""I"" consider enough up votes. Come on people damn!

That's right. This man committed evil and illegal acts for imaginary internet points.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Though steelbender0's posts are heinous, it shouldn't surprise anyone that r/creepshots is a haven for predators.

- Recently a teacher who took creepshots of his high school students was caught and fired. [It turned out that he was grooming a 16-year-old girl he met through Reddit.](http://www.thecitizen.com/articles/09-28-2012/coweta-teacher-fired-posting-pics-students-creepshots). This man is currently being investigated by Ohio police. 

- Despite rule changes, [users are still taking and publishing pictures of underage girls](http://www.reddit.com/r/creepshaming/comments/10lauc/despite_rule_changes_at_rcreepshots_creeps_are/).

- [One r/creepshots user recently attempted to obstruct justice](http://www.reddit.com/r/creepshaming/comments/10guj4/obstruction_of_justice_creeplove356_attempts_to/) by warning the target of an ongoing police investigation. The suspect apparently attempted to buy sex from an underage girl.

- Steelbender0 started by taking creepy, invasive pictures of a woman and escalated to raping her. He is just the latest r/creepshots user to engage in immoral and illegal behavior. It's unlikely he'll be the last.

R/creepshots is devoted to [enabling](http://www.reddit.com/r/creepshaming/comments/zu1j1/throwaway13689_shares_photography_tips_with_other/), [normalizing](http://www.reddit.com/r/creepshaming/comments/10mz8d/dochopper_taking_pictures_of_women_without_their/), and [supporting](http://www.reddit.com/r/creepshaming/comments/10gvfg/keep_it_up_predditors_turn_rcreepshots_into_the/) men who [fetishize non-consent](http://i.imgur.com/zAIFT.png) and [treat women as public property](http://www.reddit.com/r/creepshaming/comments/10hhkw/effort_post_creeps_blame_their_victims/). It was only a matter of time before one or more of its users did something far worse than take a picture.

**Reddit is enabling criminal and predatory behavior. How many more women [and girls](http://www.reddit.com/r/creepshaming/comments/101z6x/effort_post_evidence_rcreepshots_violates_reddit/) are going to be hurt before Reddit shuts r/creepshots down?**

1346103941.0,353,self.ShitRedditSays,yxc2m,[Effortpost] The antifeminist history of r/feminism: past and present,485,132,73,http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/yxc2m/effortpost_the_antifeminist_history_of_rfeminism/,"Note:

This post is broken down into three parts.

Quick Resources for easy digesting:

The sidebar of /r/feminism reads

&gt; Welcome to the feminism community! This is a space for discussing and promoting awareness of issues related to equality for women.

&gt; Please help us preserve the intent of this space as a place for feminists to work together.

CSS coding has even been used to change ""readers"" and ""users here now"" to ""supporters of equality for women.""

But as nicely as the sidebar can be dressed up to be, it does not accurately reflect the atmosphere of the subreddit.

About six months ago, [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/Feminism/comments/ozc2e/how_rfeminism_makes_me_feel/) sprung up in r/feminism - with hundreds of upvotes and comments, it is the most upvoted thread in the entire subreddit. The comic illustrated how MRAs and antifeminists dominated discussions and were incredibly hostile to feminists and how the moderators weren't adequately taking care of the problems being voiced; the comic ended with the feminist Redditor departing from the subreddit.

Six months later, and the comic would need only minor alterations - perhaps a panel with a moderator valiantly defending the MRAs and whacking a feminist on the head with a mallet reading ""BANNED."" Or maybe something like [this](http://i.imgur.com/oCiFV.png).

There has long since been a problem in r/feminism with MRAs, antifeminists, and nonfeminists overpowering discussions in threads. Some of the first comments in threads - some of the most upvoted comments - are often made by people who are negative of feminism or negative of the thread. Threads are commonly derailed (click [here](http://derailingfordummies.com/) ([mirror](http://birdofparadox.wordpress.com/derailing-for-dummies-google-cache-reconstruction/)) and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/qf33g/effort_derailing_101/)  for explanations of common derailing tactics), points are dismissed, and peoples' posts are often broken down and dissected with the most asinine arguments by people who are not simply critical of feminism, but are hostile and antagonistic toward it.

Let's be clear about what the problem is: The issue is not that r/feminism isn't some echo-chamber for everybody to agree in. The problem isn't that there's dissent or disagreement. The problem is that a *very large portion* of comments in r/feminism are antagonistic towards feminism or dismissive of threads. Basic principles of feminism aren't simply debated - they're openly rejected by people who think feminism is little more than a joke. The subreddit /r/WhereAreTheFeminists has been documenting instances of antifeminist comments in r/feminism, many of which are the first comments in the thread or some of the most upvoted. 

Imagine what a subreddit like r/Democrats would be if a significant percentage of the users posting in it were Republicans. Imagine what kind of discussion would take place if the majority of the threads began with comments about how the article was mean to Republicans, or that the issue presented isn't an important one. Imagine what r/evolution would be like if the majority of posters were creationists who think basic principles like natural selection are ridiculous.

**Feminists cannot engage in feminist discussion in r/feminism because so much of the discourse is antifeminist in nature.**

This is perhaps the biggest issue with the subreddit, but hostility toward feminism in r/feminism has manifested itself in different ways.  Over the course of several weeks, r/feminism had developed a downvoting problem, where as many as half the threads on the first page (and almost always, at least 8-9 threads) either had a score of zero or less than zero. 

The moderators have made some efforts to clean up the subreddit, but their attempts have been inadequate, and it has been extremely difficult to get them to take action. It took three threads ([1](http://www.reddit.com/r/Feminism/comments/vtox9/psa_take_a_look_at_the_new_queue_if_you_havent/), [2](http://www.reddit.com/r/Feminism/comments/wjhpf/meta_more_than_half_the_threads_on_the_new_page/), [3](http://www.reddit.com/r/Feminism/comments/x39rw/what_the_hell_is_going_on_here/)) before the moderators dealt with the downvoting problem (solution: remove downvote arrow!)  Some of the worst trolls in the subreddit, after months of trolling and months of complaining about the trolls, were banned, although some remained, and new ones are rolling in. Where MRAs and antifeminists have been excused and forgiven repeatedly, many feminist users have received messages, ban threats, and even bans for language and tone, largely built out of frustration about the state of the subreddit.  /r/Meta_Meta_Feminism was recently created to document instances of abuse and injustice by the moderators.

**In recent months, there has been a change with the moderators: those who have not become inactive have become increasingly hostile to feminism and the feminist userbase.** 

r/feminism has 5 moderators, down from 7: scurvy_wench left and the_quietness was removed as moderator within the past few weeks. The userbase was not informed of this.


impotent_rage - Recently did not post for a span of three weeks; similar large gaps.

(Edit as of October 24, 2012: 

wabi-sabi, a [total](http://www.reddit.com/r/Meta_Feminism/comments/y9151/why_is_wabisabi_a_moderator_of_rmeta_feminism_but/c5tki5s) shitlord, either had his account deleted or banned, and no longer shows in the mod listings on the subreddit.

MidnightAria was made a moderator. No announcement was given, no input by r/feminist users was provided. The account is an alt of somebody, having been inactive for four months prior to being modded.) 



That brings us to demmian, basically the only moderator who posts in r/feminism and who is the primary catalyst (followed by impotent_rage) behind the current and recent instances of abuse of the userbase.


First, a history:

Although r/feminism was created about three years ago, the original founder and sole moderator abandoned the subreddit. People found the subreddit and turned it into a shithole of spam and other garbage. A year or so ago, a user by the name of Cliffor made a thread in /r/redditrequest asking for transfer of the subreddit to his account. Cliffor was a very well known MRA troll at the time; sodypop (r/2XChromosomes moderator) and kloo2yoo (r/mensrights founder) saw this request at about the same time, and asked the site administrators not to give Cliffor the subreddit. The admin gave them both access to the subreddit.

Shortly after, users became outraged that kloo2yoo was made a moderator of the subreddit, as he is passionately antifeminist (going so far as to compare feminism to [brainwashing](http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/f5bvx/brainwashing_techniques_and_feminism/)). He left and sodypop sought out new moderators.

An interesting observation can be made in sodypop's [thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/Feminism/comments/h09g1/rfeminism_is_looking_for_some_moderators/) about choosing new moderators: Donna_Juanita and avnerd were both nominated by multiple people in the subreddit, but impotent_rage was not. sodypop, who was *not* previously a regular member of r/feminism, made as a moderator somebody nobody else in the subreddit had voted for - and made her a moderator before he made the others moderators.

Fast forward a few months, and you get to the comic I posted earlier. Fast forward a few months further, and you get a thread like [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/Feminism/comments/sojal/this_is_why_im_so_close_to_unsubscribing/), with more sentiments regarding the hostility toward feminists in a feminist subreddit.

Getting the moderators to moderate has proven to be very difficult, and every feature the moderators have implemented has also been used by them to abuse and mistreat their users.


For the purposes of understanding the situation with r/feminism, it’s helpful to think of r/feminism and r/AskFeminists as the same unit. Both overlap in their moderators, and r/AskFeminists was made *for* r/feminism, in order to reduce the amount of discussion by nonfeminists in r/feminism. 

However, in the same way that women-related subreddits have become overrun with men and MRAs (some people joke about how r/AskWomen might as well be r/TellWomen), so to did r/AskFeminists become overrun with nonfeminists and antifeminists.

This became such a problem that the moderators decided to implement a flair system in r/AskFeminists to distinguish between casual users and people who were well versed in feminism – “Feminist Contributors” as well as “Feminist Expert.” Nobody was ever given the “Feminist Expert” flair – except for me, and that was only for a few hours.  Nonfeminists and antifeminists were asked not to make top-level replies. You didn’t need the flair to post top-replies, but you did need show that you were a feminist.

Now, as you’ll notice in [this thread]( http://www.reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/comments/tmnpd/we_have_a_new_system_of_flairs_to_identify_our/), nobody is flaired. There’s a story for this.

---

###SRS is unequivocally against the doxxing of anyone.

Why?

If a SRSter starts or even seems to support doxxing, it's going to bring a lot of harm to the community because there are a lot of irrational and scary as shit dudes out there who already want us gone.

So if any of us even appears to support doxxing, it is something that will harm every single one of us because it gives shitlords license to come up with their shitty own justifications for doxxing us. We have so much more to lose than a bunch of pedos/white supremacists/MRA's/whatevers. The safety of SRSters matters more than anything else.

**If you see someone talking about or trying to dox SRSters or anyone, send me a message.**

**It will get taken care of very quickly.**

The admins take doxxing very seriously and it doesn't matter who does it. So they will be equally as fast to crack down on SRSters who are trying to dox or even talk/joke about supporting doxxing.

But they aren't the only ones who will be on your ass. The glorious mass hammer of the Femperial Gynquisitor stretches across the entire Fempire and she will make sure that doxxers never find a home in it. It is something that seriously and truly threatens the entire community so **don't fucking even think about doing it.**

Is that clear for everyone? Good. Now let's get back to advancing the Fempire in the name of BRD.

Woops! Those fields actually matter a whole lot in the real world (this is why MRA's sadly accomplish nothing in the real world in terms of legitimate activism). It's also why atheists in /r/atheism will always stay in /r/atheism.

Let's not forget that child pornography is one of those few things that even in this highly polarized climate, both conservatives and liberals in the real world will come together and stand vehemently against.

And that's even before we get into the media and how they feel about child pornography or creepshots; the look on Anderson Cooper's face  during the VA interview on CNN just says it all.

I read some post in one of the unfemp subs where it said SRS is winning the propaganda war or whatever and then there are those hilarious posts by demmian trying to counter our message or whatever they think they're doing.

This isn't even a war though; that would imply that Reddit understands how to even fight let alone where and when to fight.

Right now, they're all in their big man babby cribs (or private mod subreddits) crying because no one in the real world gives a shit about their explanation on why ephebophilidelphia is soooo different from pedophilia (and then they wonder why no one ever trusts them with their kids).

The real world isn't going to care that Reddit is a bunch of city states or that there is all this nuance in how the content is handled by moderators and not admins or that SRS is a bunch of man-hating meanies with weird emoticons and memes.

And unlike other things that Reddit tries to talk about authoritatively, good PR/marketing is not something you can learn from reading a bunch of Wikipedia articles or even textbooks.

Here is a free pro-tip to all the aforementioned nerds trying to improve reddit's completely destroyed public image: you don't bring up how you give pizza to a couple randos on the internet in defense to the all the massive traffic brought in from taking and sharing non-consensual sexual pictures of women and children.

lmao

pls discuss and openly gloat about how we are the best at everything

**Possible points of discussion:**

* How did Reddit/Redditors end up this way (ie not understanding why bringing up charity pizza does not cancel out creepshots/child porn)
* What do you think will happen next to Reddit, its power users, and its regular users?
* On a scale of 1 to amazing, just how much do you like Gabby, the most charmingest and modest archangelle in the fempire

We've had some instances recently around the Fempire where cissexist comments were upvoted and embraced by the community. Beyond that, we haven't been perfect when it comes to checking ourselves on ableism, racism, and misogyny. So knowing that, heed this:

1. If you're privileged in any way, which most of us are, consider if you've been jerking over issues you don't completely understand. Edit: This goes for those of you who are a minority under one axis of oppression, but still have privilege along others. You're bound to fuck up. People get banned every day for jerking too far, using slurs, or just just being an oppressive fuckhead in general. This is getting way out of hand. **You should constantly reevaluate how privilege affects the way you participate in the Fempire, and that includes Prime.**

2. [Read this. All of it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/125lon/yo_cis_srsers_we_need_to_have_a_talk/) Get learned on issues you don't know about before jerking about them, or posting to SRS about it. While you're at it, read [all the required reading for SRSD](http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/11luw7/metaupdated_required_reading/). 

3. Cissexism will no longer be tolerated as part of the jerk. Consider this your warning. There are plenty of resources for you in /r/SRSDiscussion and failing that, /r/SRSRecovery. Ignorance is not an excuse.  

All of this is on us as a moderator team as well. We've let this go on and even participated for too long without addressing it, and for that we apologize. Rule X still stands, but it won't get in the way of you calling someone out for saying something oppressive, even if that includes Archangelles or other Fempire mods. None of us are perfect or immune from criticism. Report any comments you find to be cissexist, ableist, or generally oppressive, and we'll try to get to it in a timely manner. If someone argues with you after you've called them out, report it and [let us know](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FShitRedditSays).

I have never had the Internet effect me in such a way as this subreddit has. you all have opened my eyes to things I couldn't see before. not only the blatant sexism, racism, ageism, pedophilia, LGBT hate, rape jokes, and creepiness of reddit, but really in pop culture. I think women, minorities, the LGBT community, and religions that have been so long the butt of so many cruel, insensitive and unfunny jokes, and persecuted in society for thousands of years have a long way to go to reach equality, but the first step must be educating people that these inequalities still exist. this community is fantastic for that. 

I haven't been on reddit long, but I used to love it. I would read the comments, laugh and look at the next post. after discovering this subreddit, I saw it everywhere. and I couldn't believe real people thought like this. reddit is supposed to be such a ""progressive"" site but how is it progressive to want kiddie porn, degrade women in every thread, mock transgendered people, dehumanize minorities, mock others' religion, and let people know that you masturbated to them? all for imaginary Internet points that do nothing to better the world, yourself, or your peers. 

anyway, I'm just saying this is a great place in a world of darkness and the exact opposite of what this site claims to be. the mods in here actually care about what they do, and the users actually care about the content. everyone owns up to what they say and doesn't just claim ""it's just the Internet so my attitude towards things don't matter LOL""

http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hunf5/iama_sex_offender_convicted_of_possession_of/

**To summarise** - OP joined an online community created to distribute child porn, and downloaded and got off to images of minors performing sex acts. The FBI targetted this community, OP got arrested, charged, admitted guilt and got a 5 year probation order and lifetime registry entry rather than 20 year sentence if he'd pleaded innocent and lost. OP now has to undergo regular therapy and probabation meetings.

OP at no point has stated he feels he has done anything wrong, doesn't believe he's a pedophile, totally doesn't deserve all the things that have happened to him, and the therapy and probation meetings he's had have made him mentally ill, and he believes the feds and justice system has ruined his life.

Reddit agree, and are upvoting anything sympathetic to the OP, and agressively downvoting ANYTHING remotely critical of the OP or his actions, and in fact downvoting anything remotely critical of child abuse.

Also a lot of OP's story doesn't add up - being made to take polygraphs where that shouldn't happen, therapists telling him he's evil etc. But of course that doesn't matter to reddit when it comes to defending pedos.

there's no way that you can get assent in a disclaimer at the bottom of an email, it's ridiculous, there's no precedent near it. the kardashian case is criminal harassment, which isn't really similar, and besides, it was a threat rather than a real case. if the kardashians can't make a case from it, this company have no chance.

Alright Seddit, this is my first [FR]. I was readin' through all of yours to get an idea of how to follow up with this One Night Stand, and then I decided I might as well write one myself!

Me and my buddy, ages 17 and 15 respectively, are invited out to an invite only house party at my gay friend's house. He hooks us up with liquor and women, since we threw a cool house party ourselves a while back. We get into state on the way there, talking about previous plays with this girl my buddy is after. For reference purposes, he's Alex.

NOTE: I am graduated, hence posting it here. If you'd like, I'd be happy to x-post this to r/highseddit.

We get to the house party very early, to help set up and smoke a joint before things get started. We do just that, and by the time the party heats up, we have a good buzz going from a few games of beer pong. It quickly fills with LBs, something I wasn't hoping for. However, things are going well, the party is okay. I'm slipping in and out of state because there are so few women.

Fast forward to around 11pm. Jello shooters come out, and I take one to this girl (HB 7-8) who's sitting by herself on her phone. I usually don't approach women, they approach me, so this was a step out of my comfort zone, but I didn't really give a shit, since the worst she could do is reject me, am I right? Not to mention I was drunk. I chat her up, offer her a jello shooter, and realize she's pretty shy. This works well for me, because I'm not the smoothest PUA so any insecurity women have works greatly to my advantage. The conversation ends, I end up sitting there awkwardly, and she eventually gets up and goes to the group of girls standing by the beer pong table. No big deal, this happens, I start a conversation with the dude next to me.

Fast forward a little more, my wingmen - Alex and a girl who's telling HB 7 how hot I am - are feeding her booze and telling her about how bad she should bang me. This probably isn't something Seddit sees a lot, but these are drunk teenaged girls we're talking about, not experienced clubbers. All the while, Alex and his girl (another HB7) are having copious amounts of sex in the shower, hottub, bedroom, and upstairs bathroom. I end up approaching her again, and in a drunken slosh of words, get her to follow me downstairs. It's sexy time. I take her on this bed that happens to be right in front of the bathroom door, and after a short exchange of poorly assembled sentences, we make out - right as the homosexual host leaves the bathroom. I DGAF, but we stop, and he points to a room to our left, and says ""That's your room"". We head to it, close the door, and get down to business. As it turns out, she just got out of a relationship a month ago and has only had sex with one guy, and doesn't want to have it again - After removing some clothes and making out for a good 45 minutes, she changes her attitude. We have some of the worst sex I've had, and probably some of the best sex she's had, for a good 20 minutes. We stop, then go at it again in a few minutes, finish, and pass out in each other's arms (aww!).

I just texted her a few minutes ago (today is the day after) about making future plans to hang out.

I think the biggest problem I encountered was her lack of confidence - I shine when I have a girl who will reflect my confidence back to me. Let me know what you think, Seddit.

Some of the most balanced, insightful, inspirational and hilarious threads I have ever seen on reddit come directly from here. It’s a breath of fresh air from the mountainous pile of shit festering in this site. 

I know you probably heard the story before. I’ve been on reddit since 2007 (obviously not this account) mainly as a lurker. I enjoy listening more than hearing myself speak. 

Originally, I thought reddit was the bestest site in the universe. Being exposed to so much of everything life has to offer and listening to a lot of interesting people and their thoughts was such an amazing feeling. 

Gradually, things started to change for the worst. I lose hope in humanity every time I read the evil and hateful things they say to and/or about women, people of color, overweight and obese people, and the entire LGBT community…mainly anybody who is not white, straight and male. What really started to get to me was the open pedophilia and, especially as a black man, the blatant racism. 

Soooooo much shit from such an amazing set of supposed progressive intellectuals.

And the sad part about it is that a lot of this simple, cheap, unfunny crap is generated just so they can get a high score of karma. How pathetic!!!

I have learned to avoid most of the larger subreddits, especially r/videos and r/WTF. The smaller niche subreddits are the only reason I continue to stick around. Well, that and r/shitredditsays :D
Anyway, thank you for you! Keep on keepin’ on and all that good stuff.

&gt; Just because you disagree with the content doesn't mean the content should be taken down. As long as it's legal anything should go. What you're asking for is censorship, which I find disgusting.

&gt; I know this will be downvoted because people like to downvote offensive things. I know you people find this offensive. I find this offensive. However just because you find something offensive doesn't mean it should be deleted, removed, or have users posting it banned. If it ever crosses a legal threshold it's a different story. What some people here are asking for is a complete deletion of all content in that subreddit. What you're asking for is censorship. Imagine for a second millions of christians lobbying this website to remove /r/atheism because they find it offensive. Imagine them getting their way. Now you know what it's like to live in Korea or China. It's bullshit. I've always taken pride in redditors and their ability to oppose rights infringement. Whether gay marriage, religious oppression, censorship, police brutality, or the war on drugs. However when I see threads like this it makes me truly sad. [(+51)](http://i.imgur.com/INkpf.png)

Only if they were naked pictures of children would a court need to determine the intent (whether it was for artistic purposes or lascivious).

&gt; a.) i'm fucking FLABBERGASTED at reddit's baldfaced hypocrisy -- where's the outrage over the MULTIPLE subreddits whose sole dedication is gore/snuff content? i made a post weeks ago questioning their morality and was down-voted into oblivion.

&gt; b.) can you honestly, in the same fucking breath, baw about SOPA and then turn around and implore reddit to take down /r/preteen_girls, as if it were a moral imperative?

&gt; c.) practically speaking, shit like this, however gross, serves to divert the (perfectly natural and not of their choosing) urges of these guys into an activity that's not fucking your children. you want to shut down their only channel and push them even nearer the brink?

&gt; Wait, what was that whole thing about SOPA/PIPA and how internet censorship was the worst possible thing that could ever happen? I'm pretty sure everyone on here unleashed pure molten fury over that. And now you're saying you want this part of the Internet censored because it bothers you?

&gt; Ooooookay.

&gt; EDIT: I keep getting notifications of replies to this, and apparently people can't read. I'm NOT comparing SOPA/PIPA to censorship on reddit. ALL I'm saying is that, based on the reactions to those, the general feeling on reddit is ""censorship = bad"". Yet, here, even though this isn't illegal, it bothers people, so they request for it to be censored or removed. It's just ironic, is all. I didn't think my point was that hard to get, haha. I'm not here to compare the situation of SOPA/PIPA to a random sub-reddit being censored, and I'm not here to discuss and debate over the definition of what censorship is. I was just making a point that the hivemind is a little hypocritical and ironic. Jesus. [(+17)](http://i.imgur.com/aJrxw.png)

&gt; Tell that to all the forever alone guys who are virgins. Tell that to all the rape fantasies out there. You can't simply equate desire to the action. You are essentially of the same mindset that my desire to run over 5000 pedestrians in GTA means I WANT to do that in real life. You think that me and my gfs rape fantasies imply I will be raping peeps soon. There is a difference between fantasy and the action. You can't STOP people from having these desires. Be they jailbait, preteen, murder, rape fantasies, or violent video games.

&gt; By your logic, we should cut the desire out of people's brains, since desire leads to action. I bet 99% of pedophiles don't act on their urges, because they know it's wrong, but unfortunately have something wrong with them, which they realize. Many seek therapy, many DO look at this type of porn probably, and many would never ever want to hurt a child and actually rape a child.

&gt; Sociopaths are not pedophiles. I would equate pedophiles more to homosexuals, IN THE FACT THAT, it is NOT a choice. No person wakes up and says I've decided that little children please me more. They realize it's a problem in today's society.

&gt; I can't believe there are people that think desire will lead to action. 1984 much? I am disappoint.

&gt; Oh, another example, every couple where the bf masturabates to other women on porn? I'd say about 99.9% of relationships. You just argued that they all desire to cheat on their partner. [(+15)](http://i.imgur.com/3noWZ.png)

&gt; Probably an unpopular opinion, but, I don't really see the big deal, as long as it stays within certain boundaries. If that satisfies pedophiles/hebophiles enough to not go any further than fapping to pics of girls that were in no way damaged by the taking of photographs, why judge?

&gt; Giving it a quick browse, it does seem plenty of the material could be considered cp in The Netherlands, though. Those with focus on private parts and unnatural poses. [(+13)](http://i.imgur.com/UwIkK.png)

###Law &amp; Order: SVU: Reddit
*Starring:*

[](/smug) as Special Detective Reddit Hivemind

[](/niwrad) as The Chief

     **Interior: Chief's Office 8:32am**

[](/smug) You wanted to see me, Chief?

[](/niwrad) Yes, come in Detective. We've got a serious problem and I'm counting on you clean it up. I've got more than 50 cases on my desk here of alleged rape, pedophilia, and other assorted sex crimes. It's a damn shame. Making the site look bad too.

[](/smug) Wow. Rape is really bad. I'll get right on it and make sure that justice is served.

[](/niwrad) Knew I could count on you, Detective.

    **Interior: Special Detective Reddit Hivemind's Office 1:32pm**

[](/niwrad) Detective! What are you doing here with your feet up on the desk? You should be out there solving that stack of cases.

[](/smug) It's all good, Chief. I solved them all.

[](/niwrad) How's that possible? That's not possible. You better explain yourself, detective.

[](/smug) Well, it turns out that no crimes were committed.

[](/niwrad) I'm listening…

[](/smug) Sure thing. Let me break it down for you.

[](/smug) In a lot of cases, it wasn't a rape at all, just [some girl offhandedly saying it was rape](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1257p7/whats_the_most_fucked_up_story_youve_ever_heard/c6s9rx6) [+21] this can be a real problem because it gets innocent bros into trouble. Then you have situations where a underage woman lied about her age and [tricked the guy into sex](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/124d72/this_was_attached_to_an_application_that_came_to/c6s5aec) [+137]

[](/niwrad) Don't they know how much that can fuck up someone's life?

[](/smug) Exactly. Similarly, we have some situations where the girl sneaks into an adult place and does adult things. The dudes photographing her [distributed her photo in good faith to a mega porn company](http://www.reddit.com/r/offbeat/comments/124gok/woman_says_she_was_exploited_in_girls_gone_wild/c6s2yhz) [+31] and now *she's* the one complaining.

[](/niwrad) Jeeze. She should take it as a compliment.

[](/smug) In other cases, what happened was [the woman overreacted](http://www.reddit.com/r/nottheonion/comments/124l2d/man_asks_do_i_know_you_says_no_i_dont_walks_away/c6s3xsq) [+81] to a threat that just wasn't real yet.

[](/niwrad) Why don't they wait until they've been beaten before coming to us?

[](/smug) Beyond that, there's a lot of situations where innocent dudes [mistook silence for consent](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/rhfnv/my_sexed_teacher_says_this_is_ok_because_he_didnt/c45w0tl?context=2) [+299]

[](/niwrad) How was he to know?

[](/smug) And then there's the usual made up stories to get out of [cheating on their boyfriends](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/123a64/this_guy_whipped_out_his_dong_at_a_feminist_pride/c6s1pkg) [-35], vague situations, instances where she just wasn't resistant enough, and so on.

[](/niwrad) See this kind of thing every day.

[](/smug) Exactly. On the lighter side, sometimes it's not rape at all, [just a lucky young man getting it on with a hot older lady.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/122it6/whats_the_worst_thing_you_have_ever_done/c6rlt48) [+2627]

[](/niwrad) Nice work, kid.

[](/niwrad) And nice work to you too, Special Detective Reddit Hivemind. Your methods may be unorthodox but I can't argue with your results. This will free the squad up to deal with legitimate rapes, and forcible rapists.

TRIGGER WARNING FOR ALL OF THE FOLLOWING LINKS - most center around an extremely graphic threat of sexual assault

* Beardpocalypse is the story of the time that a Men's Rights Activist and YouTube celebrity deleted his account following an SRS-induced public meltdown, the likes of which we may never see again.  Our journey begins [here,](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/peojo/personally_im_sick_of_all_the_pansyass_emo/c3owrie) where The Amazing Atheist aka TJ notices that ICumWhenIKillMen's username is evidence of rank hypocrisy afoot in SRS, and proceeds to take a dump in the thread in order to alert us.
* After an unceremonious benning, he decides to cry about it to [Mensrights.](http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/pfejx/i_love_how_the_whiny_feminist_morality_brigade/)  Because Mensrights doesn't allow links to SRS, his post is removed - meaning that once [SRS finds the thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSMeta/comments/pfo27/theamazingatheist_loves_srs/) ([cross-post](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/pfw6j/meta_internet_celebrity_the_amazing_atheist_is/)), it's basically just us and TJ in there for HOURS.
* Aaaaand the rape threats start.  TJ submits [pretty much the worst comment ever posted to reddit,](http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/pfejx/i_love_how_the_whiny_feminist_morality_brigade/c3p2ccl?context=5) in which he openly tries to trigger a rape survivor.  ([SRS thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/pg29r/trigger_warningmeta_theamazingatheist_truly_is/))
* Around this time he pauses to vlog about his ongoing meltdown and appears [real mad](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ciysnuaikuor6vj/Arguing_on_the_Internet._Why.mp4) on cam.  Recommended viewing. [edit: he tried taking it down but luckily I saved it for posterity.]
* Despite his vlog's central theme, such as it is, being the folly of internet arguments, TJ plunges headfirst back into the thread - again, a removed MR thread consisting entirely of SRS regulars - and continues his meltdown for several more hours, until it climaxes with veerserif's complete and utter smackdown of TJ, and his response: [""congratulations on ripping my fucking soul out.""](http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/pfejx/i_love_how_the_whiny_feminist_morality_brigade/c3p2srn?context=9)
* At this point the rest of the internet notices the sheer scale of the ownage and starts to show up in the thread.  [PZ Myers to veerserif on the fallout:](http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/pfejx/i_love_how_the_whiny_feminist_morality_brigade/c3p60ce?context=1) ""He just became a pariah in the rational part of the atheist community.""

* SRS mods post [a couple short love notes](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/pgti8/mod_mail_bag_trigger_warning_taa_drops_some_mad/) from TJ.
* Finally, [TJ ""apologizes""](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/pgufe/meta_so_the_amazing_atheist_messaged_me_an_apology/) to the rape survivor he had threatened and harassed earlier.

1345367741.0,260,self.ShitRedditSays,ygtx2,[Effort- trigger warning] This is what rape culture looks like.  ,394,134,104,http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/ygtx2/effort_trigger_warning_this_is_what_rape_culture/,"TW for this whole post.  

I read [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/yfn0p/seizure_sex_is_amazing_and_i_didnt_stop_55/) submission, by YourWaterloo, and since I'm the type of person who ignores all the, ""DO NOT ENTER, SHITZONE AHEAD"" signage, I had to look at the original post, which was a veritable poo tornado. A tornadoo.  This is where the humor ends, because it gets bleak as shit from now on.  

As you already know from the original thread, a rapist describes how he raped his girlfriend, by continuing to have ""sex"" (rape) with her while she was seizing, and therefor unconscious.  Apparently, to reddit rapist B-roox, it was much more important that he gets sex out of his girlfriend, than to you know, make sure she's okay, and also, uh, *not rape her.*  

And so he did rape her.

But this seems to be a concept that is *so very very hard to grasp,* even in this extremely cut and dry case.  It isn't one of these hypothetical cases reddit brings up where the woman is ""only slightly drunk, and regrets it the morning after,"" (which makes *so much sense* because if she regretted it, she'd *totally* want to make it public and open herself up to invasive scrutiny). No, this isn't even one of reddit's imaginary borderline cases.  She was unconscious.  She could not consent.  And nobody can argue that he just didn't *know* that people are unconscious during seizures, because [he wrote](http://i.imgur.com/r2VhQ.png), ""Well. I did do that, but that wasn't me. **Also, people are unconscious while seizing so...**"" [emphasis mine]. 

So here we have a guy, who *knew full well what he was doing,* [to a completely unconscious woman:](http://i.imgur.com/mrcUx.png)
&gt;""I was dating an epileptic. She started seizing. I'm ashamed to say that it was amazing and I didn't stop.""  
&gt;EDIT: For those of you morons who are calling me horrible names because I didn't stop to help her, there's nothing you can do for someone who is having a seizure outside of making sure they don't physically hurt themselves, which I did (we were in a bed). Again, no harm was caused in the making of this sex.

&gt;EDIT 2: It's hilarious how far some of you people are removed from reality. Im not even going to dignify your criticisms with responses anymore.

Oh, he doesn't consider himself a rapist.  Of course he doesn't.  And do you know why? Well, let's see how most redditors respond to him.  

[""Ride the Lightning"" \[+515\]](http://i.imgur.com/GRy54.png)

[""Are you the same person that finished when she was seizing because you thought she was coming, and then she got super pissed at you?"" \[+64\]](http://i.imgur.com/gQvPz.png) 

[""I thought I just gave you the best orgasm of your life and you had to fucking ruin it"" \[+58\]](http://i.imgur.com/BbdgI.png)

To be fair, there *are* comments calling him out for being a rapist, and it's really fucking sad that they are such a relief, because they *should* be par for the course.  

""How does it feel to be a rapist"" [+27]

And this is how others respond:

[""How does it feel to be a moron?"" \[+25\]](http://i.imgur.com/iruIx.png)

[""You're an idiot. Obviously, based on the question, they were already having sex. He said he made sure she was safe, which is literally the only thing you can do while somebody is having a seizure. "" \[+10\]](http://i.imgur.com/DXB30.png)

[
""Yeah he should have stopped, but he didn't rape her."" \[+9\]](http://i.imgur.com/33IfS.png)

[""Well she did give consent for them to have sex in the first place... Had he have stopped, would he have been a rapist for the .whatever amount of seconds his dick would have still been inside her? I agree he should have stopped, but there was consent, so he did not rape her."" \[+11\]](http://i.imgur.com/T6OeL.png)

And now here's another person calling out the rapist:

""This just in: what you did is exactly what the typical rapist does."" [+18]

To which someone replies, 

[""Have consensual sex with a person, and continue when he/she starts seizing? That's the *typical* rape scenario in your mind?""\[+39\]](http://i.imgur.com/OsPF7.png)

Here's another gem down thread, and by gem, I mean horrible and vomit inducing: 

[""Doesn't matter, had seizure"" \[+20\]](http://i.imgur.com/xeIAD.png)

Now, for the final kicker.  Here is a very insightful post (no sarcasm here) by seewatudidthere: 

&gt;Rarely do rapists think they're rapists. Rape culture teaches us that rape only happens in a violent way where women kick and scream for you to get off of them, when in reality rape is any time somebody is penetrated without consent. She may have given consent to begin with, but that consent is revoked as soon as she is unable to revoke it herself (eg passed out, unconscious, seizure). In that situation I would have felt so incredibly violated. Unless your girlfriend explicitly gave you consent to have sex with her even if she had a seizure (which she obviously didn't), you raped her.

To which someone replies, 

[""Whenever I see the made-up phrase ""rape culture"", I know to stop reading."" \[+11\]

[""durrr rape culture durrr patriarchy durrr"" \[+10\]
](http://i.imgur.com/ysNUe.png)

This is what rape culture is.  A rapist being defended.  A rapist telling his story, and getting mostly laughs or pats on the back.  A rapist not considering themself a rapist, because others condone the behavior, joke about it, laud it. And then, after having all of this *right out in the open,* to be told that rape culture doesn't exist.  That it's just a silly thing the feminists made up.  

This is what rape culture is, and it's fucking depressing.

You have been thus warned. 

first of all i just wanted to add that this post comes with a massive trigger warning for ALL the links. a big, big one. and a MASSIVE virus warning for all outside sites. i vetted this post with a mod before hand but i am willing to change it if there are any more problems.

know what makes me mad? well Reddit a lot, but also certain parts of reddit. /r/upskirts and /r/upskirt for instance. i don't like any of them. but i know something they don't know. i know i've been collecting data on them. i know how illegal their shit is and i know about PANDA and i know the media is watching what we're doing. i have a friend travelling to europe soon for a wedding in rome. i'm going to make it a little safer for her before she goes.

this is my first submission to project PANDA, but it won't be my last.
allow me to introduce a rising star on /r/upskirts and r/upskirt, /u/EmbraChula . supposedly a woman, this person likes to post illegal upskirt pics from the church steps of france, rome and the subways of russia, but most often from the steps of french and roman churches. that's right, this person hangs out in front of churches to get upskirt shots. wedding parties are a particular favorite. as of now she is one of /r/upskirt and /r/upskirts most avid posters, even going as far to request /r/upskirts after it was abandoned a while ago. often upskirts of younger women and women at weddings are what she focuses on but anyone is fair game. the videos are by and far the worst. she also posts lots of ""hidden camera"" upskirt videos that are from websites that host quite a large variety of illegal material. here's one example:

[upskirt video posted 23 hours ago to /r/upskirts uploaded from a virus heavy site](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xa37fs_windy-upskirt_sexy?search_algo=2)

[and before anyone asks, here is a screenshot to prove all this illegal shit was posted after an alleged takedown was supposed to happen, despite new rules that i am so sure are being super-enforced...](http://imgur.com/9M17w)

so /u/ just go and look it up if you want more. or you know what? ignore the evidence and save your soul because that username and the person behind it is basically a deposition waiting to happen. i think it's okay in this case to go after a specific user, and not just a sub, because 1) she is a mod, and it proves that the mods cannot, will not, and actually like participating in distributing exploitation porn here and 2) it proves that although lip service is being given to cleaning up /r/creepshots and their ilk, there is a lot more work to do and just going after /r/creepshots will not work, which is why- 3) there needs to be a site-wide change to keep this shit off Reddit as a whole, and not just go after subreddits, because there are some people and mods here that are really dedicated to keeping reddit shitty. 

on a side note, i also think it is reasonable to assume that this person may not be a woman, or at least not the woman she says. or it could be a bot. the writing style and worrying lack of empathy towards other women just doesn't feel right. nevertheless: i reported the photos, the shots, and the locations and i let the police in moscow, paris, and rome to be on the lookout for an upskirt photographer in the photo locations. honestly, i don't know what will happen with that since the language barrier made things difficult and sadly, crimes like this are often not high priority. it helps to have photos and web addresses though, and if nothing else the police in Rome absolutely DO NOT like to hear that brides on church steps are being exploited like this one was five hours ago, well after /r/upskirts said they would knock this shit off. and they ARE going to be on the lookout for upskirt lurkers at weddings.

One very important caveat: Those findings do NOT mean that abusing children is okay because ""they'll get over it."" 

Which is exactly what that quote I used as the OP is saying.

- Two terrible sources: both written in the 1980s, one only a summary, and the other written by a pedophile who was the founder of the ""pro-pedophile movement"" 
- TOTALLY misunderstanding Freud's interpretation of patients telling him about sexual abuse (he actually was so shocked at its prevalence that he convinced himself the women were making it up)
- Quietly promoting incestual sexual abuse within his post; OP calls it ""early sexual activity with their families"".  Ain't that cute and euphemistic?
- Conflates children's sexuality with an automatic ability to consent to and participate in sexual acts
- Claims pedophilia was just fine and dandy worldwide (tip: it wasn't) until the 1980s obsession with ritual sexual abuse (which turned out to be not going on) but also apparently the pro-pedophilia community has glommed onto it to blame all their legal woes on it...or something.

Oh, **r/Science**, I expected more of you. I thought unsubstantiated bullshit was a no-no there, and especially bullshit promoting abuse of people, including children. Certainly 25-30 year old sources are a no-no, yet the post still stands.

&gt;With todays fear of sexuality and politicians desire to be 'tough on crime' coupled with peoples belief that children are fragile crystal glass that have to be monitored at all times pedophiles make for easy scapegoats. 

Won't someone think about the pedophiles?

1350625705.0,254,self.ShitRedditSays,11qguc,ViolentAcrez - A severe disconnect or a cover up. A year in review.,356,102,79,http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/11qguc/violentacrez_a_severe_disconnect_or_a_cover_up_a/,"ViolentAcrez, after being outed and suffering real life consequences from his actions, has distanced himself from his online moniker claiming it was all trolling. Today we will walk you through the life of ViolentAcrez as told by his now deleted comments. We will look at his trolling and his supposed characters love for girls who are in their early to mid teens. 

I was first introduced to ViolentAcrez by Anderson Cooper, and eventually found SRS, which I found out was responsible for getting the media involved. What I know of him comes from reading online during the last year about the long history he has had on reddit. 

This will be a long winded attack on ViolentAcrez and how even if he was just doing it because of trolling, his actions were still wrong, the reddit admins wrong to conspire with him and allow his actions to shape the structure of their community and the people in it. The poor public relations campaign by Violent Acrez and the admins still fails to take responsibility for anything, offering nothing more than conciliatory apologies and weak excuses. A company that has no regard for its community, doesn't see the need for a communications director, puts people in positions that they are unqualified to be in, and promotes programmers and gamers into positions that they have no previous background in. 

This is partially a story about ViolentAcrez, but also a bigger story showing the failure of the people who run Reddit to address growing community issues, focusing solely on growing the community sacrificing the community in the process. This is why you have heard on every communication by those higher up that it is ""unsavory"" ""a bit of a pickle"" ""distasteful"" and all the other arguments, is because they don't want to involve themselves properly with the community, they want it to run itself.

Subreddit Drama and Violent Acrez:

My first interaction with this person comes 3 months ago. A 14 year old actress is in a comedy video, multiple people are arguing about ecoliphebolia and it gets posted to SRD. [VA is in the linked SRD](http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/vqxts/dora_the_explorer_movie_trailerid_watch_the_hell/c56v90f) thread beneath the first deleted comment. You can tell because a beloved SRSter blueorpheus is in there wondering why he got downvoted for calling VA a piece of shit. 

[Here is the SRD thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/vrems/some_people_in_rvideos_find_a_14_year_old_actress/c5702rb?context=3) where he is back to being his real self, an atheist, and arguing against the catholic church with me. 

Here comes the last time I interact with VA before he is outed and deleted his account. The reason for deleting the account was that he was ""tired of reddit"" and that he was moving on. This is untrue, he was an easy way for him to disassociate himself from his previous actions, even if they were just trolling. In the Chen article he talks about how he stands by his previous actions, which is also untrue, because he deleted his account for being done with reddit, and then uses other accounts to stay on reddit. It's like he's a lizard, shedding its skin, he's even kind of apologizing for his actions. The problem with this idea is that actions become ingrained over time, even if you are just joking around or trolling, these ideas have ways of leaking out into 'the real you'. 

The foreshadowing of some of my comments and his comments is a little mind blowing.  This was from [SRD a month ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/yz2re/drama_in_rnews_as_uviolentacrez_calls_all_gun/c602ydi?context=3), where VA snapped and started posting links to a visualize.us account for jailbait. Here is [googles cache of it](http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:-g5TlZkWO_8J:vi.sualize.us/violentacrez/%3Fvideos+http://vi.sualize.us/violentacrez/&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl), which doesn't contain any jailbait, but shows  he had 69 images and the tags he used for those. 

He gets banned from SRD, and I reported him to the admins for posting links to jailbait, but nothing happened.  Here is the rest of the [comments from that SRD post](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/yz2re/drama_in_rnews_as_uviolentacrez_calls_all_gun/c603x24?context=3).

VA replies to me

&gt;Wow, entire *minutes* per day!  All the *work*!

&gt;*Yawn*  Every time I create something like my Pinterest, The Concerned Citizens Brigade leaps into action to get me shut down.  I like watching you monkeys jump.  **You amuse me, and cause no lasting harm.**  Keep it up.

Someone replies to him, at the time I thought it was hilarious, but the CNN interview is his senate hearing. 

&gt;you're like a sad and pathetic Frank Zappa.

&gt;i'm afraid you'll never get your senate hearing. does that... change things for you?

Now here is where we examine the disconnect. Even if it was a troll and not real, this is all mostly done for attention. Even the CNN interview, trying to get the people who once supported him on his side. Naively thinking that years of posting porn and jailbait has won him the respect of his peers. He is a sick man, in any way you view this. 

A very small part of me feels sorry for him, his wife, his kids. I feel sorry mostly for his kids, because they don't have a choice if he is their dad or not. His wife I really can't feel sorry for considering she stays with him and prefers to be willfully ignorant of his dark side. I do feel sorry that she has medical issues, but if his family and providing for his wife was his main concern, he would have given up reddit long ago. I wanted him in jail and reported him multiple times to the police and FBI. In my opinion he got off lucky with only losing his job. 

[Ex SRD mod upset with VA being banned and not being given a warning for posting jailbait. Where I explain why he won't be banned from reddit.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/yz2re/drama_in_rnews_as_uviolentacrez_calls_all_gun/c60q0aj?context=3)

Looking back through [the years](http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/7okgl/reddit_awards_best_reddit_of_2008_comment_here_w/), the multiple twitter messages to employees at reddit, and the congeniality between the admins and him, and it paints a much different picture than those at Reddit would like you to believe. Awards for being a pimp daddy, trophies, all were thanks to VA driving up content for this website, which drove up hits, which made more profit. 

The severe disconnect is also very apparent on the employees at reddit. It's like overseeing a gang, and not wanting to admit that they kill and steal. In the beginning of reddit there were only a few people posting content. VA symbolized efficient automated means to drive up content, and thus users. In the reddit employees opinion, this was a good thing as long as they didn't have to deal with the ethical side of what was being posted. This is why they distance themselves from the idea of having any control of subreddits, when they do by having friends, power users, and employees as mods. They don't have to take responsibility for anything posted here, because there is no content actually hosted here, and subreddits are 'city states' which control themselves. 

Here are a few more interesting links:

[Violent Acrez AMA where](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/c5866/by_request_i_am_reddits_creepy_uncle_violentacrez/) a large portion of comments had been removed by admins, or VA before he deleted. Most of the comments deleted were about his sexual exploits with his teenage step daughter, and a few other condemning comments of his.

###THE SMOKING GUN

VA known for being proud of his online infamy and achievements, still has not deleted his imgur. He isn't sorry. He, like everyone who can see through the mess of excuses is saying, is only sorry that he got caught. Begging for money and jobs online shows how far he has fallen. From being a megalomaniacal sociopath, to a beaten man

HIS IMGUR IS STILL UP WARNING THROUGH GOOGLING HIS NAME AND IMGUR CONTAINS JAILBAIT


I do think maybe he was trying to reform a little, he modded Lauralei in a trans* subreddit he modded, and he made a few changes to previous subreddits he modded. This reformation was not in any way what he spent his time on reddit doing. In the big picture, it shouldn't even be a consideration.

---

###Final Conclusions

The people who run reddit rely on volunteers to run their site because it is cheap, but in the long run the quality of the website declines and the social issues increase. These social issues reach a boiling point, or due to media attention they rise to the surface and the people who run reddit are forced to deal with it. One has to wonder if the lack of focus on the community is due to not caring, or because if they did it would require more employees and would cut into profit. When do the social issues start hitting their bottom line? Instead of properly dealing with the issues, they face the fall out of people feeling they don't value their privacy, don't value their time spent here, and don't value them. 

This website can't sustain itself like this while still having a policy of allowing teenagers as young as 13 allowed on the website. Without even needing an account you can on occasion view adult material. The admins and VA are now being dragged kicking and screaming by the media through the mud of  their actions that shaped their community, and they have cried the entire way.

I know this subreddit is SRSbsns, but I would like to be *serious* for a moment. I have a favor to ask. Some of you may recognize me. I moderate more than 70 subreddits, including /r/pics, /r/EarthPorn and /r/ITookAPicture, among others. I want to talk to you about reports.

Moderators of the default subreddits look at reports very closely. Believe me when I say that a mere 10 reports is almost unheard of in a default subreddit unless the comment or submission is a *blatant* violation of the rules or TOS. Most of the default subreddits have a hands-off approach when it comes to moderating comments (there are usually simply too many violations to enforce consistently so the mods don't even try). However the comments that get reported are the ones that are reviewed by a mod. Comments with 10+ reports are reviewed very closely and are often removed.

Now, some of you may be content to simply participate in this circlejerk for the lulz, but I know that a large percentage of you are genuinely concerned about the pervasiveness of racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic or otherwise hateful comments. All of those are blatant violations of the ~~TOS~~ User Agreement. Mods are supposed to *enforce* the UA. Personally I remove any comment that violates the UA if I see it in the reports queue.

Here's the favor: if you see a comment submitted here that is a blatant violation of the UA, **please report it.** Its a simple click, and it puts it on the mods radar. Laughing about it isn't going to change anything. Reporting it might.

My wife and I got married in 2008. We were two young, horny legal adults who were deeply in love. We also brought our unresolved issues into the marriage. Our first year was awesome, but in year two we started a slow descent into chaos. I started getting jealous of her friends, especially the guys. She is bisexual and has told me countless times that her women friends were more of a threat than her male friends, but my jealousy was directed squarely at the men. I started getting more and more manipulative, sometimes exhibiting  boderline controlling behavior. I was in a lot of pain, very fearful, and was unable to talk about it, while also struggling with my own sexuality.

We pressed on, having some really great times and some really shitty times. Our fights were getting worse. She had called me a ""misogynist"" more than once, and even though I didn't know what that word meant, I was sure she was wrong &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;. I am a very liberal displaced southerner, not one of these knuckle-dragging rednecks. I was convinced that *she* was wrong for having so many friends and being so popular, and I let her know it. Looking back on this, I have more proof of how much she loves me than any man should ever need.

I joined reddit on January 18, 2011, after a few months of lurking. I ""jumped on the bandwagon"" became a regular shitposter, racking up considerable comment karma, until one day a bot told me that my comment had been linked to on [/r/ShitRedditSays](/r/ShitRedditSays). I don't remember the comment, but I remember it was posted by office_fisting_party, who I promptly pulled a one-man bridge on. I started posting ""Fuck SRS"" in any thread that I thought they would show up in, hoping to make SRS famous(ly hated). If [/r/antisrs](/r/antisrs) had existed then, I would have probably been all over it. I even checked out /r/mensrights, but my liberal upbringing and general intelligence kept me out of there. 

I used to lurk SRS, hoping to find some sort of smoking gun with which to crucify you. What I found was *actual* shitposts that redditors were *actually* upvoting. I went to wikipedia and looked up ""misogyny"" and said, ""Holy shit, that's me!"" It was on a subconsious level, but I definately showed signs of woman hating. (This is why I try to give redditors a chance. Many of them don't *know* they are shitlords.) 

Here comes the [TW]. This is the first and only time I have ever laid hands on my wife. I knew my anger could get out of control, so I had developed, as a sort of sick coping mechanism, the habit of rushing out the door when our fights got too intense. I would yell at her, scare her, make my kids cry, and slam the door behind me. I always told her it was so I could calm down and clear my head, and then we could continue our discussion rationally. I know now it was all about manipulation and control. 

Well, one Sunday, when I was on my way out that door again, she decided to stand in my way. It wasn't courage that made her do it, it was love. I grabbed her by her arms and physically moved her. She didn't fall down, she didn't cry out, she just looked at me. I cannot describe the look of fear in her eyes, but those who have seen it need no description.

I cannot change the past, but I can change the future. I grew up in an abusive household, and it is my greatest wish that my children do not. My sense of male privilege, my misogyny, my anger, and ultimately my fear almost destroyed the greatest woman I will ever know. 

Since that day, I am no longer willing to be angry at my wife. That's the best way I can describe it: the *will* just isn't there anymore. The only redditing I do is in the fempire, and I wouldn't have it any other way. You see, before I got to SRS, I always believed I was right. I never realized that scaring someone or manipulating/controlling them was abuse, even though that's how my family was when I was growing up. Now, thanks to SRS, I can't bullshit myself anymore. I can't give myself an excuse for my actions that I believe. If I have feelings I can't deal with today, I have to (gulp) talk about them.

My wife and I are moving out of state in a few weeks. She has been the biggest help to me since that fateful Sunday. I am now ok with her, because I am ok with me. I identify as pansexual now, which I have always known deep inside but was never able to let out until I talked to her about it. That's how I live my life today. I talk about things going on inside me and when she talks, I listen. The only alternative is to let my anger build until it destroys her. I love her so much. I will do anything to never see that look in her eyes again. And without SRS, well, I don't even want to know where we'd be.


Thank you, SRSters, from the bottom of my heart.

---
**Q: What is SRS?**

**A:** In short, a circlejerk. A lot of people get really, really sick of the bigoted shit upvoted on this site and our community functions as a break room for them to laugh, vent and commiserate without being dismissed, silenced through downvotes or needing to explain why the comments suck over and over. This is why the mods are quick to ban and why the rules to keep it a circlejerk are so stringent. It may come off as asshole-ish, but part of the appeal of the sub is that for once we're the majority. It's our space and we don't have to make room for people who don't ""get it"".
More to the point, SRS is a place for those who already know why something might be considered offensive; not for those who wish to find out why.

**Q: Why mock people?**

**A:** Take a second to think about how unwelcoming this site is for some groups. SRS lets those groups know that there is a faction of vocal dissenters and they aren't alone. Most of the commenters who post disparaging remarks about a race/gender/sexual orientation take for granted they'll rarely, if ever, have to face similar remarks about their own race/gender/orientation; all the  while refusing to empathize with the subject of their scorn. These people are usually the ones that get up in arms when the tables are turned and they are suddenly faced with the uncomfortable reality of having become an object of scorn and ridicule themselves. Not only is it hilarious to watch, but it occasionally causes people to question their remarks.


**Q: How is cutting off rational discourse going to make a difference? If you want to change reddit, shouldn't you explain why something is wrong?**



**A:** We are not here to ""change reddit."" We don't expect reddit to change. We know most redditors don't really give a shit. They aren't interested in listening and most don't want to sacrifice the upvotes they'll get for a rape joke, even at the expense of triggering a rape victim. Having said that, a large portion of our users have absolutely taken shitposters to task through sincere debate in the past, and many still do. But realize that it is a tiresome, fruitless experience 98% of the time and we have found fighting fire with fire to be substantially more gratifying.

Users who still have the patience to engage in debate are directed to [/r/SRSDiscussion](/r/SRSDiscussion). However, SRS prime is a circlejerk and nothing more.

**Q: Okay, but you catch more flies with honey than vinegar. More people would be on your side if you weren't so aggressive.**

**A:** This is called a [tone argument](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Tone_argument) and has been used to silence and dismiss marginalized groups for a long time. At the end of the day, these groups are allowed to express their feelings in what ever ways they see fit (so long as they don't break any laws). Telling a minority to ""be less angry"" about their status and treatment in order to make the majority more comfortable is, frankly, bullshit. Especially when those making the tone argument are the ones least affected.

**Q: Aren't you a downvote brigade?**

**A:** No. The accusation itself makes it easy for our detractors to garner support, though, so don't expect to stop hearing it anytime soon.

We do our best to make it clear that SRS's goal is to highlight terrible *upvoted posts*; not to downvote them as some sort of punishment. Being a downvote brigade would ruin the fun and ultimately lead to the demise of the subreddit. In every conceivable way, it's in our best interest to leave posts upvoted. Linking to a post with little or negative karma would be a pretty terrible way of showcasing the shit reddit says. 

**Q: What's up with those reply bots I see that respond to comments featured on SRS?**

**A:** Those bots do not belong to SRS. They were created by angry redditors in what we can only guess is an attempt at revenge for being featured. They bring a noteworthy portion of new subscribers to SRS, though, so we love them and their creators. Thanks, friends! ♥


**Q: It seems like posts are cherry picked and then held up to be representative of reddit as a whole. Isn't that unfair?**

**A:** If reddit can boast that certain acts of philanthropy are representative of all reddit (when obviously not all redditors were involved in donation drives, for example), there is no reason reddit should not also be held accountable for fostering an environment that encourages bigoted comments. Redditors may not like being called out on it, but those views are equally representative of the user-base. They can't have it both ways.

**Q: Doesn't all the hate towards white, straight men make SRS just as bigoted?**

**A:** 9 times out of 10 when someone calls out a shitposter for their sexist/racist/phobic joke or comment, they are drowned out and downvoted by the hivemind. But SRS is like a bizarro reddit where the tables are turned and your typical redditor is in the minority. If someone comes in to shame one of us for cracking jokes at the expense of young, white, middle class, cis, able-bodied, straight men that comprise most of reddit's user-base, they can expect the same behavior from us.

Turning the tables like this and watching reddit's reaction to us has been telling. It's important to understand that much of what we do here is satirical. We ridicule thoughtless, abusive and dehumanizing mindsets by reversing the position of privilege and parroting the standard defenses contrived to excuse them. Shitlords who have never dealt with prejudice -- and willfully ignore the views of those who have -- use justifications (Free speech impediment!/Just a joke!/White male discrimination!) that decenter and dismiss a complaint without ever having to actually acknowledge it and are, frankly, a bit ridiculous. 

When you get down to it, what some of these people really don't like about SRS is that it holds a mirror up to the [inherent advantages](http://www.thefreedictionary.com/privilege) that come with being in any majority. As a community, we're able to point out the [hypocrisy](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/o5dup/is_the_irony_of_reddit_lost_on_its_idiotic/) of [reddit's majority](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/o0dwm/effortpustule_make_fun_of_blacks_lol_make_fun_of/) by assuming the role of a majority ourselves. The difference is that our ""hypocrisy"" is intentional.  The people we're mocking are supposed to feel uncomfortable. It's our way of letting them know how we experience reddit on a daily basis. 

Incidentally, you might also be interested to know that our subscribers are primarily [young, white men](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/nzipz/meta_srs_survey_results/) themselves. 

**Q: Do you seriously think that white men enjoy special privilege on reddit?**

**A:** [Yes](http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/nygqe/effort_privilege_101/)

**Q: Ok I think I get it, and I agree with almost everything SRS says, but when I asked why a post was considered offensive I was berated and banned. Why?**

**A:** Once more for those in back: SRS is not for questions or discussion. In order to keep the sub from being overrun by concern trolls and shitposters, we have to be quick on the ban trigger. We've seen what happens to other psuedo-safe spaces that lacked vigilant moderation, so we have a zero tolerance policy when it comes to rule breaking.  If you felt you were banned unfairly, message the mods. We cant guarantee you'll be unbanned, but we're usually willing to look into it. 

To avoid being banned, don't step out of circlejerk formation. If you don't understand why a comment was submitted, don't defend the comment, just move on. Misguided attempts at ""satire"" that reproduce bigotry, attempting to derail threads, and posting personal information, are all easy ways to incur the wrath of the Archangelles.  

Be good, stroke in time and you'll do well.

However, I'm going to look at the responses to two examples, one from a man and one from a woman.

[The top post from a man:](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/116p62/cheaters_of_reddit_tell_us_why_you_are_currently/c6jsjyp)

&gt;The girl who had been my life, my companion was becoming a stranger. And when I did get to see her, I didn't even feel like a part of her life. She barely touched me, and I was lucky if we slept together once a month. When we did fuck, it felt like going through the motions. She wasn't present, she didn't initiate. It was passionless, robotic.

&gt; ...

&gt;But then the girl from the apartment next door started coming around. She laughed at my jokes. She told me how much she liked being around me. She would call to check up on me. She made me feel appreciated. One night we had drinks together and I slipped.

&gt;I never told my girlfriend. And we never broke up. A year later we're still together in a passionless long distance relationship. [+1868]

The top responses:

[Empathetic advice:](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/116p62/cheaters_of_reddit_tell_us_why_you_are_currently/c6jsnep)

&gt;Damn dude, sounds like you should end this relationship. [+2260]

[Bashing the OP's girlfriend:](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/116p62/cheaters_of_reddit_tell_us_why_you_are_currently/c6jsmiu)

&gt; I almost guarantee she [cheated on you], man. [+643]

[Both of the above posts fit into one post:](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/116p62/cheaters_of_reddit_tell_us_why_you_are_currently/c6jspjl)

&gt; I think it might be time to let her go, man. It's clearly not working out, what's stopping you? You've found a girl who is more fitting of you at this point, and let's be brutally honest, your college girl isn't not banging other dudes. Best of luck. [+370]

Alright, so it's pretty clear Reddit is empathetic toward cheaters, right? [Now let's look at a woman who admits to cheating:](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/116p62/cheaters_of_reddit_tell_us_why_you_are_currently/c6jsh8i)

&gt;I have cheated on boyfriends and been involved with several married men. I am not going to give you some lame excuse. I cheat because I honestly like the attention. In every relationship there comes a time when you do not have that attention anymore. Things settle in and then it gets boring.

&gt;I could break up with them, but I do not really want to. They meet the emotional need to be held and intellectually stimulated, and the new guy meets the excitement and physicality. [+744]

Different wording than the man, but it expresses the same sentiments, the feeling of being uncared for by an SO and thus relishing in the attention of others. So how does Reddit respond to a woman?

[Calling her selfish:](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/116p62/cheaters_of_reddit_tell_us_why_you_are_currently/c6jsj0e)

&gt; I feel as if you're missing the word ""selfish"" in your whole explanation. [+1188]

[Pure, unadulterated hatred:](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/116p62/cheaters_of_reddit_tell_us_why_you_are_currently/c6jskum)

&gt; Sounds like someone I know. I hate you with a burning passion =) [+126]

[Saying she has no morals and is an attention \[slur\]\:](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/116p62/cheaters_of_reddit_tell_us_why_you_are_currently/c6jsm3e)

&gt; I like that you're actually admitting to being an attention whore, so please note my upvote was for your honesty, not your lack of morals. [+95]

Hmm, this confuses me. On one hand, Reddit is sympathetic to cheaters. On another, Reddit condemns them.

What could possibly cause this flip-flop?!

She's a badass feminist who loves gaming culture and doesn't take shit. She's been incredibly strong in the face of serious sexual harassment, using it to fuel further discussion about the toxicity of gaming culture. 

[](/seemerollin)

As you can imagine, reddit is not so taken with her. 

Cue [this thread](/http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/17eu0z/its_been_9_months_since_feminist_martyr_anita/) (currently sitting at +1827)

&gt;It's been 9 months since feminist martyr Anita Sarkeesian received $150,000+ in sympathy donations, yet she's not yet produced a single entry in her ""Tropes vs. Gaming"" series. Ya'll got fleeced.

Who knew that people donating to a cause they feel strongly about and to better their community is ""sympathy donations"". Are redditors not familiar with the term ""any publicity is good publicity""? Or maybe they're just upset they've already made her point for her.

So what *are* reddit's silencing tactics, you ask?

Well, young Brds, they are varied and icky.

**First we have the implications that she is unfit for the job. Because of course redditors are knowledgeable about critical studies and feminist criticism and are qualified to make this judgement.**

&gt;[That's because she's kind of incompetent and has no idea what she's doing. Also, I doubt many people on [1] /r/gaming gave her any money.](/http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/17eu0z/its_been_9_months_since_feminist_martyr_anita/c84xetu) [+13]

""I have no evidence for this but 'I just don't like her' doesn't sound as good""

&gt;[I wish people would stop calling this woman a feminist. She's not a feminist. She's an idiot.](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/17eu0z/its_been_9_months_since_feminist_martyr_anita/c84ybh5) [+11]

Because these terms are mutually exclusive. Also, I would know what a feminist is and am definitely qualified to look at her feminist CV and tell you that she is a fraud. 

&gt;[well that's obviously because she is not really a gamer. if she was, she wouldn't even need money to buy those games, she would've played most of them already throughout her life like most of us did. she also bought those games in a hurry without much research so she can pose for that photo with a pile of games.] (http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/17eu0z/its_been_9_months_since_feminist_martyr_anita/c84xo2e) [+15]

""real gamer"". Nuff said.

**Secondly, she has a conflict of interest!**  (because wimminz)

&gt;[Her job now is to get mad at misogyny. She's doing everything she can to keep it going. Her criteria for a sexist depiction of a female are almost impossible to dodge so she'll forever be necessary. When she first created the kickstarter she made sure all the hate comments were funelled into the video for her kickstarter on youtube. She moderates the comments so any reasonable argument against her points disappears while clear cut praise and abuse comes to the forefront. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/17eu0z/its_been_9_months_since_feminist_martyr_anita/c84yhop) [+6]

TIL all film, food, art and culture critics *want* the things they critique to be bad. Because critique is only about blasting stuff for being bad. &lt;-- this is why people need more humanities in their life!

&gt;[That said, most of the donations probably were sympathy donations, less people donating because of her cause and more donating to her because the internet is a horrible place filled with misogynist assholes. Which, again, makes it kind of really fucking terrible that she so obviously fails at what she claims to want to do. I'd rather someone like Lindsey Ellis do this. Sure, I don't think she really knows that much about being a 'hardcore gamer', but she has shown that she's actually capable of reviewing something with a critical eye, and both having feminist views and being able to step outside them instead of going ""PATRIARCHY!""](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/17eu0z/its_been_9_months_since_feminist_martyr_anita/c84xetu) [+4]

""What do you mean, have I ever studied feminism? That isn't a legitimate thing to learn about, it's all just wild assumptions, which are obviously not included in my detailed and level-headed analysis of this situation.""

We absolutely do not want SRSers to be hurt by their participation here, and we recognize that being surrounded by triggering stuff all the time can be pretty damn toxic.

&gt;Check, check, check it out:

&gt;You've likely been told you're beautiful, hot, etc. by men and boys from a young age. You've seen men and boys blatantly check out your body from a young age. Men way too old to be looking at you that way saying things they shouldn't be saying. And while the media bombards you with the message that unless you're a 5'10"", 115 pound waif, you're fat; unless you wear Maybellene, you're ugly; men will tell you and show you that you are, in fact, attractive. It's been going on so long that it's just annoying now, but it happens.

&gt;Now, imagine if no man ever looked at you your whole life. No man ever told you how pretty you look today. You can count on one hand how many times a man has looked at you or complimented you in that way. But, dig this, the media's still telling you you're unattractive. The difference now is that you have constant reinforcement that they're right, they're absolutely right. No man truly finds you attractive, your boyfriends and lovers just told you you are because that's what they're supposed to do.

&gt;That's what being a man is like. Women don't tell us we're attractive out of the blue. Women don't stare at us. And the media tells us that without P90X we'll forever remain unattractive. And we don't receive any contrary experiences. Girlfriends and lovers tell us we're attractive because that's what we want to hear, not because it's true.

I don't know what it is with these guys but they never seem to get the point.

Apparently during a video chat player incontrol got into an argument with Destiny (the very same) yet it is incontrol who is being misogynistic.

When r/starcraft threw a fit over his dickish behavior he proceeds to say they are 'menstruating' and if incontrol was running a business meeting, Destiny would be ""running coffee for us or taking phone calls in a low cut skirt"".

Also I don't know if I'll have friends to hang out with this weekend so if there are a bunch of you in Austin maybe we could hang and have drinks or something Friday night? I dunno. Just a thought.

UPDATE: I think the panel went well. It was packed and there were a decent number of self-described redditors in the audience. We were critical but also mentioned reddit's ""wins,"" like bus lady, sopa, and kony 2012 skepticism. Q&amp;A began w the guy who owns imgur attempting to filibuster w a list of all the good deeds reddit has done. By the time he got to ""gift exchange"" I interrupted and pointed out we gave examples of both good and bad and that we couldn't possibly cover all of either.  Then asked if those good deeds made up for the blatant bigotry we had gone over earlier. He tried to speak over me and continue reading his list of good things. I told him he was rude and off topic and politely told him to stfu. It was fun!

Several other mangry redditors commented. One asked us if we thought the US or China did a better job re: free speech. Lol.

The panel audio was recorded and will go on the SXSW podcast but who knows when.

""Even noxious bigotry deserves consideration and debate!""

&gt; I've been supportive of the changes from the start but I draw the line at the ""bigotry"" rule.
I don't like the undercurrent of bigoted hatred in this subreddit, most apparent when it comes to all things muslim (""muslim immigrants are baby-rapist murderers/secret terrorists/Not Like Us"", basically sweeping generalizations that wouldn't look out of place on Stormfront) but if this sub is to represent the views of the atheist community it should also include those views, no matter how noxious, so they can be debated and ridiculed for what they are.[[21]](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1g98v0/policy_setting_a_positive_direction_for_the/cai05gm)

With bonus mod reply: 

&gt;Great question. Automod alerts us of any comment that includes those terms, which is how I just found yours. It really depends on the context. If it's a comment like the one I just removed:

&gt;&gt;good im glad that fag got expelled. if I was there I would have spit on her face and torched that dike

&gt;it's pretty clear what the intention is. If you're discussing it in context, the comment won't be removed.

""You're turning into atheismplus!"" 

&gt;5 leaves a lot of room for interpretation, and is basically a free pass to moderate whatever you want.

&gt; If a discussion is made about how much of homosexuality is choice and how much is determined pre-birth, that could easily be censored by a mod going ""homophobia! it's not a choice! delete! ban!""

&gt;What if we complain about the idiocy of the A+ movement, a topic that definitely concerns atheism and atheist communities? If a mod is part of A+, they could see that as bigotry/sexism/what have you.

&gt;And as others have said, what of ""intolerance"" to religions/religious concepts/etc? [[+21]](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1g98v0/policy_setting_a_positive_direction_for_the/cahztse)

&gt;&gt; Exactly.

&gt;&gt; Let these people expose themselves and let everyone tell them to grow a pair.

""Banning bigotry is a slippery slope to banning freezed peaches."" 

&gt;Defining bigotry is a notoriously slippery activity. One person's bigot is another person's outspoken slaughterer of sacred cows. Also, ironic humour is something that is indulged in by intelligent people, and it has the value of subtlety and cleverness. I have seen too many sites become humourless and heavy-handed through well-meaning attempts to ""clean up"" humorous or ironically-intended content. Please try not to go down that road and instead give people the benefit of the doubt as often as possible. Always be very, very careful about censoring anything. Freedom of speech includes the freedom to offend, and that includes things that offend us. Once you start restricting speech - even speech that you judge to be hateful or bigoted - you are on a very slippery slope indeed.

**Part II** ([x-post](http://www.reddit.com/r/creepshaming/comments/101z6x/effort_post_evidence_rcreepshots_violates_reddit/) from r/creepshaming) will highlight particular users who are specifically preying on young teenage girls during the schoolday. 

There are several contributors to r/creepshots who seem to either attend or work at high schools. Many of their submissions feature students in the background wearing backpacks and classrooms with  books and furniture that are clearly meant for a high school setting. The following are three particularly troubling cases:

----------------------------------------------------------------------

**Case 1: Ssj3trunks8**

Most of user Ssj3trunks8's photographs seem to have been taken at the same high school. A number of his submissions are 'upskirt' pictures, which are [illegal](http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/108/s1301) according to U.S. law:

[One](http://www.reddit.com/r/CreepShots/comments/w6qsz/short_skirt/)

[Two](http://www.reddit.com/r/Upskirt/comments/uy1cf/nice_blue_panties_in_class/)

[Three](http://www.reddit.com/r/Upskirt/comments/uz47n/another_upskirt_in_class_flower_panties/)

[Four](http://www.reddit.com/r/CreepShots/comments/ur2ap/another_upskirt_from_different_chick_in_class/)

[Five](http://www.reddit.com/r/CreepShots/comments/uqslk/up_skirt_in_my_class/)

[Six](http://www.reddit.com/r/CreepShots/comments/uwnd2/nice_thong_slip/)

[Seven](http://www.reddit.com/r/CreepShots/comments/urxx3/thong_slips_in_classalbum/)

[Eight](http://www.reddit.com/r/CreepShots/comments/uq8ce/girl_in_my_class_bending_over_18/)

[Nine](http://www.reddit.com/r/girlsinyogapants/comments/ur1yn/bending_over_in_class_repost_from_rcreepshots/)

Notice that the only commenter who [questions the age of the girl](http://www.reddit.com/r/girlsinyogapants/comments/ur1yn/bending_over_in_class_repost_from_rcreepshots/c4y03z5) in a picture is [repeatedly](http://www.reddit.com/r/girlsinyogapants/comments/ur1yn/bending_over_in_class_repost_from_rcreepshots/c4y040t) downvoted into invisibility. This is a regular occurrence in such subreddits. In a [different post in r/creepshots by a different user, (rectalpenguin)](http://www.reddit.com/r/CreepShots/comments/zw56m/album_of_a_girl_in_my_class/), another person protests, ""These under age submissions need to stop"" and is also heavily downvoted.

Both of these users are violating the voyeur subreddits' unofficial ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" policy regarding the age of subjects in pictures. Everyone, including mods, pretend that the subjects of these pictures are 18+, despite obvious clues that they are younger. Besides not caring about violating the privacy of the women and girls they target, the submitters and users of voyeur subreddits also don't seem to care if they're breaking the law or not.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
**Case 2: throwaway13689**

Judging from the multiple submissions featuring girls in a high school setting, user throwaway13689 appears to be preying on his classmates. He all about admits it in the comments to [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/CreepShots/comments/zm6k4/nice_cheeks/). 

I won't list every submission, since they are largely the same: a young girl wearing shorts, photographed from behind. What I will point out is how throwaway13689's predatory behavior is reinforced and encouraged by the users of r/creepshots and other voyeur subreddits: 

Here, [user NotC compliments throwaway13689](http://www.reddit.com/r/CreepShots/comments/zktqi/white_shorts/) for being a dedicated stalker:

&gt;The dedication you put into it. You followed this girl down a long hallway and beyond and still managed to center each shot, even though they are lopsided. You maintained a distance of a few feet the whole time even though there were few people going your direction.

In response, throwaway13689 says, ""Haha thank you. **Practice makes perfect.**"" Judging by the number of photographs he's uploaded to Reddit so far (**close to 500!**), it seems throwaway13689 has had a LOT of practice preying on his schoolmates.

In this series of posts ([one](http://www.reddit.com/r/CreepShots/comments/zmltw/sparkly_jean_shorts_and_nice_legs/), [two](http://www.reddit.com/r/CreepShots/comments/zut65/sparkly_jean_shorts_nice_ass_part_2/), [three](http://www.reddit.com/r/CreepShots/comments/zutty/sparkly_jean_shorts_nice_legs_part_3/)) throwaway13689 appears to have followed one particular girl around school for quite some time. Users steelbender0 and Abdullah-Oblongata respond with nothing but enthusiasm to throwaway13689's dedication to stalking this girl as she went about her day in school.

In [this post, steelbender0](http://www.reddit.com/r/CreepShots/comments/zm5l7/pink_sweater/) raves, ""Love following you, get to school more often. BTW where is this place, I must know.""

Hardly anyone ever asks whether the girls in throwaway13689's pictures are of age or not. [This is one of the only examples](http://www.reddit.com/r/CreepShots/comments/zmkz2/chunky_ass_in_tight_jean_shorts/) I've found where another user questions the age of the subject in the photograph. Neither throwaway13689 nor the mods do anything to confirm whether the girl in this picture (who is clearly very young) is a minor or not. The post in question is still up.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Case 3: Weagleweaglewde**

Now we come to the most disturbing case of all. This user has submitted a picture of a girl 13 days ago entitled, [""Hot senior chick in one of my classes""](http://www.reddit.com/r/CreepShots/comments/zbtbz/hot_senior_chick_in_one_of_my_classes/). Notice the perspective of the picture. This person is sitting in *front* of the class, right where the teacher is usually located. Strange, huh?

But maybe Weagleweaglewde is just another student? [Nope](http://www.reddit.com/r/amiugly/comments/1000f9/16f_here/c69axsq?context=3),  he's [definitely not a student](http://www.reddit.com/r/gonewild/comments/zs653/totally_caught_my_hot_professor_staring_down_my/c679t70?context=3).

Weagleweaglewde's submissions have been positively received by the r/creepshots community with a net total of 64 upvotes and positive feedback. Users creepytech,  rusrius99, and FireChrome have requested that Weagleweaglewde continue taking pictures in this class. Ramb0command0 commented, 

&gt;If you are a student that just happens to be at the front of the class: well played.
&gt;If you are the teacher: .................................................well played

It seems that all the positive feedback from r/creepshots was encouraging, since Weagleweaglewde submitted [another picture](http://www.reddit.com/r/CreepShots/comments/zjc9t/pink/) just 4 days later. This one also featured a young-looking girl sitting in a classroom. 

Who knows how many more pictures of his students Weagleweaglewde will eventually take and put online for perverts to enjoy?

**Weagleweaglewde is not only a predator, but he's in position of power over young girls.** Will his abuse of this power end at taking and uploading inappropriate pictures of his students? [Or will he feel emboldened to go even further someday?](http://www.reddit.com/r/AmISexy/comments/zqqb5/my_girlfriend_in_highschool_doesnt_think_shes/c6713l9?context=3)

----------------------------------------------------------------------

What's particularly disturbing about the voyeur subreddits is that individuals are having their perverse, invasive, and illegal behavior validated and encouraged by many others. The ""great community"" of r/creepshots (a quote from their sidebar) showers submitters with upvotes, positive comments, and sometimes [explicit requests for more images of the same girl](http://www.reddit.com/r/CreepShots/comments/zuigi/chick_i_sit_next_to_in_class/). In short, these voyeur subreddits normalize and encourage predatory behavior.

Students should be able to attend class without having their privacy violated by fellow students and trusted authority figures like teachers. Girls should be able to go to school without worrying that sexually suggestive images of them are being uploaded to popular websites like Reddit for thousands to view and ogle.

**How many more girls are going to be violated and exploited before these subreddits are taken down?**

BURY IT BURY IT BURY IT

&gt;While this is true, I'm noticing a lot of people lately specifically targeting ""users of reddit"" or ""users of this site"" for their reprehensible behaviors.

&gt;I think it's important to note that the users of this site are just ordinary people, and ordinary people are fucking reprehensible things. It has nothing to do with reddit.com. This is just what happens when technology gets to a point where all of the ordinary, reprehensible idiots (aka everybody) has the ability to instantly share any and all information under anonymity.

&gt;I'm not trying to excuse anyone for their behavior, just trying to add additional context because it's not a reddit.com problem, it's a humanity+technology problem.

Reddit responds predictably.

The top comment: ""What a load of nonsense. People on reddit looked at pictures and discussed them. That's what reddit does every day.

Second-from-top reply to that comment: ""People want to blame that on someone. Or they want to blame it on an entity. They need a brand to blame. So they blame Reddit for being a huge, largely democratic discussion forum. Or they blame the Internet generally, for being yet larger and yet more anarchic.

And some self-righteous twat with no special insight on the topic writes an editorial like the one linked, which tsk-tsks at everyone for sharing ideas too readily.

Blame human nature. And flee for a less free cultural environment, if you must. Flee for a censored and controlled media, and unfree forums for public discussion. As that would avoid this problem of ideas going viral. There were relatively few such issues, in the TV news era.

But blaming it on a brand or a culture is bollocks. It's the price of ideas being exchanged so quickly, widely and freely. Ideas have power. And they can do no harm if you don't let people have them.

But I don't see that as a solution. Nor do I think that ""the Internet"" invented wrong conclusions, self-indulgent reasoning, retributive overreactions, or wishful thinking.""[+22](http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueReddit/comments/1cobhb/the_internets_shameful_false_id/c9imur3?context=1)

[SRS starts here,](http://www.reddit.com/r/LadyBashing/comments/b2qo2/this_reddit_seems_to_be_the_epitome_of_irony/c0l6ani) at the bottom of a post on /r/LadyBashing.  At least, the roots of SRS as we know it, the reasons it's evolved the way it has, it all makes a hell of a lot of sense after spending a few minutes sifting through the ruins of /r/LadyBashing.

The idea behind that sub was basically the same as SRS, except it focused only on sexism.  Anyway, [mensrights killed it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/LadyBashing/comments/b2qo2/this_reddit_seems_to_be_the_epitome_of_irony/c0kopoo)  They invaded the sub and overwhelmed it with their [votes](http://www.reddit.com/r/LadyBashing/comments/9ya8h/one_vigilant_day/) and their mansplaining and their [concern trolling](http://www.reddit.com/r/LadyBashing/comments/9kurc/do_you_think_maybe_were_getting_a_little_too/) and their [what-about-the-menzing.](http://www.reddit.com/r/LadyBashing/comments/9nj9z/can_i_post_male_bashing_here_too_this_comment/)

All this to say, SRS was by no means the first attempt to catalog the shit reddit  says, nor was LadyBashing (check their sidebar for even earlier examples), and the Fempire's evolution and outlook were informed by how reddit had dealt with our predecessors.

**GENESIS - Fall 2010**

[In the beginning,](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/dk30k/lets_play_guess_the_redditor_housing/) there was [reddit_sux.](http://www.reddit.com/user/reddit_sux)  Some poor soul, documenting the shit reddit says, basically alone, save for a few weary refugees from LadyBashing and other mostly [\(but not totally\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/TransphobiaProject/) inactive subs.  reddit_sux created [the original SRS pastime,](http://web.archive.org/web/20101101061224/http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays) our oldest tradition, the game [""Guess the Redditor,""](http://www.reddit.com/user/reddit_sux/submitted/) in which you read comments and guess which ones come from reddit, and which ones come from Stormfront.

**DARK AGES - Winter &amp; Spring 2011**

Like untold millions of others, reddit's relentless shittiness eventually drove reddit_sux to peace the fuck out.  In their absence, people would occasionally submit shit reddit said to SRS, but nothing would ever get more than a handful of comments, and sometimes the sub would go weeks without a post.  Some rando named InstantKarma got ahold of the sub in a redditrequest but didn't do anything to grow it and promptly abandoned it himself.  (In a fun little episode, he returned one year and 20,000 subscribers later to denounce what SRS had become.)

**REVIVAL - Summer &amp; Fall 2011**

At some point, some goons in the SomethingAwful thread dedicated to pointing out reddit's shittiness found SRS and circlejerked some of the shit we had highlighted.  A few of them became [regular contributors to the sub,](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/j9cwg/yo_rmensrights/) and then, a year ago, [mods.](http://www.reddit.com/r/redditrequest/comments/j94lu/request_only_mod_of_rshitredditsays_is_idle/)  From here on out SRS had a steady flow of [content](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/jflzd/good_little_list_of_some_of_reddits_racism/) and growth.

Switching to bullets now because everything after this is, in the words of Homer Simpson, just a bunch of stuff that happened.

I even know exactly where this photo was taken. uggghhhh. 

It was posted in /r/funny because what's more HIL-AIR-I-US than taking a picture of someone without their consent and posting it on an internet forum that millions of people frequent? I don't even know how I'm containing my laughter right now! The title of the post is ""I'm Not Sure What to Conclude From This"" (uhhh that you're a terrible person.)

1337101814.0,215,self.ShitRedditSays,togcz,[META] On ableism,393,178,200,http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/togcz/meta_on_ableism/,"Yesterday, a regular, long-time contributor to SRS made a post that inspired me to hit the ben button.  The user in question had made a derisive comment, in which they joked that ""Redditors have poor control over their voluntary bodily functions."" This is an extremely ableist joke to make, and clearly some discipline was in order.

It was not, however, this comment that was alarming to me; SRSers, like every other group of people on this planet, fuck up on a pretty regular basis.  What was alarming was SRS's collective response to it.By the time I saw it and removed it, it had accumulated nineteen net upvotes.  It was displayed in my RES as [19|0].  Nobody had reported it.  Nobody had called it out.  Almost twenty people on SRS had seen this comment and decided it was worthy of their passive approval, and everybody, until I came along, had mindlessly overlooked the fact that a very ableist comment was being mindlessly approved of in SRS.

This is far from being the first such event, either.  I have been noticing these things happening, again and again, for a long time, and I have talked with other disabled SRSers who have experienced the same. Little effort has been made, however, to make this a welcoming community for SRSers with disabilities.

Until now, that is.  I have decided that I am unwilling to watch yet another progressive community, this time my own, collectively act like casual bigotry against me and people like me is acceptable.  It's not, and no longer will it be treated as such.  From this point on, ableism will be much less tolerated in SRS.  Those who make ableist comments in SRS or affiliated subreddits will be reprimanded and, likely, benned.  Everyone is encouraged to call it out where they see it, and to report it (either by hitting the report button, sending in a modmail or contacting me directly, in PMs on reddit or in the IRC, where I’m usually logged in as ‘razi’ even though I’m not often in the main channel).  The passive toleration of ableism on SRS is *over*.

If you get benned for ableism, do know that you are welcome to appeal it; ideally, respond to the ben message with a link to the offending comment and an explanation that demonstrates that you understand exactly why what you said was problematic, and chances are that we will have mercy on you.

Otherwise, I encourage everyone to educate themselves about ableism.  There are plenty of resources out there on the subject -- I spent about ten minutes compiling some links about it, which will be listed at the bottom of this post (and feel free to add more) -- and hopefully I will start writing soon about my own experiences as a disabled person over in /r/SRSDisabilities.  Mostly, though, just please remember that we, people with disabilities, are among you, that this is our community just as much as anyone else’s, and that it is your responsibility to refrain from being carelessly hostile to us if you wish to remain part of this community.

Let's see what ""comforting words"" they have to offer.

One person asks, [""are you social enough?""](/http://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/19co3m/men_of_reddit_what_comforting_words_do_you_have/c8mz3io)[+3].  OP responds that she is quite social.

Better rearrange your social life to seem more trustworthy. [+7]

What's that? Getting rejected makes you feel bad about yourself?  Well:

&gt;[That's a good thing to learn. If you hadn't you might have been stuck waiting for someone cooler and more good looking than you thinking that it was just ""having standards.""](/http://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/19co3m/men_of_reddit_what_comforting_words_do_you_have/c8n32dv)

Also, consider [lowering your standards](/http://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/19co3m/men_of_reddit_what_comforting_words_do_you_have/c8n2huc)[+23].

Then there's this guy:

&gt;[I'm not sure why I should take the time to offer comforting words to a gender that has rarely, if ever, offered me the same.](/http://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/19co3m/men_of_reddit_what_comforting_words_do_you_have/c8n27u6)[+9]  

But, what we really, really must know before replying... are you fat?  

Based on no information at all, [you're probably fat :-)](/http://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/19co3m/men_of_reddit_what_comforting_words_do_you_have/c8mxquk)[+6] (he actually used a smily, after calling her fat)

In fact, a lot of them think she is probably fat, then they [scold her for getting offended](/http://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/19co3m/men_of_reddit_what_comforting_words_do_you_have/c8n1hbd)[+13], and by ""scold"" I mean also [call her a bitch](/http://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/19co3m/men_of_reddit_what_comforting_words_do_you_have/c8nhxxh)[+2].  Despite no evidence but the words she types, she's wrong and [""literally"" is fat](/http://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/19co3m/men_of_reddit_what_comforting_words_do_you_have/c8n4wdd)[+2].  And why not, after all:

2. In the comment section, [down arrows become Upvotes.](http://i.imgur.com/Z4IVK.png) Comments would appear to have negative karma when they've been upvoted. Shitposts would appear in the positive range, and still be hidden if they reach the 5 vote threshold.

2. **Confuse the shitlords** who come in here and try to downvote the entire front page and the comments.

Another video of Police [using excessive force on a defenceless man](http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/wry7r/do_you_think_this_is_police_brutality_the_system/) [+1496] has all of Reddit's feels:

* [The way he conducts himself would imply he enjoys inflicting pain on others while disguising it as duty.](http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/wry7r/do_you_think_this_is_police_brutality_the_system/c5fy2x2) [+543]
* [That seems to be enjoyment of causing him pain.](http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/wry7r/do_you_think_this_is_police_brutality_the_system/c5fzdil) [+75]
* [That was pure ""I'm pissed off and going to punish you"", plain and simple.](http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/wry7r/do_you_think_this_is_police_brutality_the_system/c5g2nbo) [+36]
* [**No one deserves that treatment for just talking**](http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/wry7r/do_you_think_this_is_police_brutality_the_system/c5g2ogs) [+3]

So let's examine how [Reddit reacts](http://www.reddit.com/r/JusticePorn/comments/ztxy0/get_outta_the_vehicle_lady_git_outta_da_car_lady/) when a 77-year-old grandma is pulled over for speeding. She starts off by explaining to the officer that she's in desperate need of a bathroom because of a bladder infection. He interrupts her, instantly escalating the situation, and **25 seconds** into the traffic stop he threatens her with arrest. **30 seconds** into the video he's physically assaulting her, not *five seconds* after explaining her obligations to comply. **56 seconds** after first saying hello, he brutally pulls the defenceless 77-year-old onto the pavement. I stopped watching there, because fuck that shit =/

By all expectations, this should be seen as a classic case of a poorly trained policeman escalating a situation without reason, and punishing a defenceless member of the public for showing any sort of defiance. And by 'expectations' of course I mean 'you're wrong'. Because in Reddit's hierarchy of hate, elderly women fall way below male police officers:

Where the heteronormative man rapes one womyn at a time in his dull, savage way, the sinister transsexual seeks to take by force the Feminine itself into his own body and symbolically rape ALL womyn through the heteromimical ritual penetration of his own surgically inverted penis-as-appropriated-vagina.

&gt; I'm all for feminist dialogue, I'm just against feminist militantism and stupidity, which a lot of the stuff (especially on the internet) tends to be. As a friend of mine once said, 'feminism was much better before the feminists got involved'.

&gt; ____

&gt; http://www.reddit.com/r/antisrs/comments/x6n5h/does_the_majority_of_rantisrs_objects_to_feminist/c5js7sc

&gt; I object to inane, subjectivist postmodernist dialogue in all its forms, and to all attempts to pass off interpretivist socciology or non-experimental psychology ala Freud/Jung as science desrving any intellectual authority. To the extent that large segments of academic feminism build their discourse around these rotting corpses, I reject that discourse, while maintaining a commitment to fair and equal treatment for women. If that makes me not a feminist, then I don't want to be one...of course, that would probably put me solidly in the company of most of the original founders of feminism, so no sweat lost.


&gt; ____

&gt; I don't even know anymore. I'm all for equality, but when I read all this crazy shit that calls itself feminist, I'm tempted to say that I do.


&gt; ____

&gt; http://www.reddit.com/r/antisrs/comments/x6n5h/does_the_majority_of_rantisrs_objects_to_feminist/c5jrc7h

&gt; Feminism does not allow for dialogue. It's either their way or the highway. So the question makes no sense.

Now, upon watching the video, it is absolutely clear that **this video is not meant to be something sexual or arousing**. In fact, as a former GW poster (an exhibitionist who unfortunately became too fearful of doxxing and the dissemination of photos without consent), I found it quite inspiring that Lady G would be so open with her body as to perform with it in this way. Ain't nothin' shameful about a woman's body, the video said to me. In fact, her nakedness seemed to be a ""non-issue,"" sexually speaking, in the performance, and appeared to me to be focused on demonstrating this method of meditation/exercise.

**Women's bodies should not be sexualized 100% of the time (unless the woman in question wants to be sexualized 100% of the time). For indeed, a woman should decide when she wants to be sexualized.**

[A survey](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/171wki/women_of_reddit_if_you_could_change_one_thing/) launched today to gauge whether men can take criticism from women in a constructive way has found that 98% percent of men on reddit can not, in fact, take any criticism at all.

An additional 95% has also decided to return the criticism to the women themselves, generally blaming bad male behavior on women.

Here are some excerpts from the survey.

**Criticism**:

&gt; To understand that no means no, no does not mean that we just ""need some convincing"" [+86]

Reactions:

&gt; [Do you have any fucking idea](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/171wki/women_of_reddit_if_you_could_change_one_thing/c81gwcf) how many times a woman has feigned disinterest, that I respected and said ""OK. See ya,"" and then had her turn around and say much later ""Why didn't you just try harder?""

&gt; because no means no, you self defeating twat. Women say that, but they can't parse it with their need to feel valued by pursuit. [+75]

.

&gt; [I'm sure that ""yes"" means ""yes, but I'm going to need more convincing"" more often than not.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/171wki/women_of_reddit_if_you_could_change_one_thing/c81gims) [+7]

**Criticism**:

&gt; Don't try to solve all my problems, just LISTEN. [+73]

Reactions:

&gt; [If we say something: ""OMG just listen!""](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/171wki/women_of_reddit_if_you_could_change_one_thing/c81fq5f)

&gt; If we stay quiet and only listen: ""OMG do you even care?!?"" [+58]

**Criticism**:

&gt; I know, I'm sick of guys whinging about the friend zone. Sorry that I want some male interaction but don't want to date you! [+18]

Reactions:

&gt; [The problem there starts when some women \(not all, but many\) will act like they want a sexual relationship](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/171wki/women_of_reddit_if_you_could_change_one_thing/c81gcr4) (excessive flirting, getting all 'huggy', etc.) for weeks on end and then, at the end of it, say that they want to be just friends. There is nothing more frustrating in the world than being led on and having your time wasted by somebody that you thought was attracted to you. [+31]

**Criticism**:

&gt; Slut-shaming. Or avoiding a woman because she is perceived to be a slut. (I'd change this about women too) [+51]

Reactions:

&gt; [Women are far more harsh and far more cruel to other women regarding ""slut-shaming"" than men could ever be. At least in civilized countries.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/171wki/women_of_reddit_if_you_could_change_one_thing/c81g53d) [+32]

**Criticism**:

&gt; the ""i can do this, i am a man""-behavior, when we are just trying to HELP. (yeah, i know, it's hard to admit, but the ability to fix a bike does not come with the possession of a penis.) [+38]

Reactions:

&gt; [Try to see it from his perspective](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/171wki/women_of_reddit_if_you_could_change_one_thing/c81gzey). Most guys see fixing stuff as some sort of challenge, a chance where he can learn/proof something to other or to himself. If you help him, then you take that from him and he still won't be able to do it alone. Its like a puzzle and someone else tells you the solution. [+9]

We have contacted a specialist, Dr. Stefani D. Ildz, who has this to say: ""It appears that the men in that thread can not calmly take criticism, and feel instead a childish need to blame someone else for their problem, point out that others are just as bad or paint themselves as the true victims of the criticized behavior."" 

""We will be launching Feminist Re-education and Work Center in the second quarter of the year, hoping to stem the tide of mangry dudebros. Funding has kindly been provided by the 'Women for the Exploitation of Friendzoned Guys', a grassroots organization working to exploit free labor and gifts from friendzoned men all over the world.""

**FUCKING TRIGGER WARNING**

The top post in /r/sex right now is [this horrifying personal account of someone being sexually assaulted.](http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/zp0mp/he_was_drunk_and_terrified_me/) Many posters are trying to be supportive, which is good, but because this is Reddit, we can't have nice things like supporting a rape survivor without our Armchair Detectives casting skepticism on any story involving rape.

You might wonder, after reading the account, what details they could possibly go off of in order to conclude that the story must be fake. So, Internet Detectives, what have you found?

The following are all [from one \[+79\] comment:](http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/zp0mp/he_was_drunk_and_terrified_me/c66ibog)

&gt;This has to be someone trolling. There are FAR too many intimate details in the OP's post for someone that was essentially raped. 

Yup, it can't be real, because they *remembered too much about it*. 

&gt;I want everyone to really think hard about this and how they would likely act if they were raped.

Followed by a quote of the story with elements bolded with regards to what the rapist was doing to her. 

&gt;All over your face? Not just... on your face? This is the second time you mentioned his cum.

She's using slightly more descriptive language than I might have? Well then, **case fucking closed** she's making it all up obviously.

The saddest part about this particular thread though? She felt compelled to respond with *pictures of her abused body* to appease this douchey motherfucker. That she felt like she had to do that just goes to show how fucked up such a response even is. His response to that is highly downvoted, luckily, but essentially it's not enough to convince Internet Detective #1.

Of course, this dude isn't the only Internet Detective on the case! [Let's ask another one what they think. \[+12\]](http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/zp0mp/he_was_drunk_and_terrified_me/c66ionb)

&gt; Going to Reddit first, not to family or friends?

Yeah, because no one could ever be in an unsupportive environment with no one else to turn to. Survivors would have absolutely no apprehension about sharing the details of a rape with people they knew first, and this guy of all people certainly knows what it's like to be in that situation at all!

&gt;Not going to the cops because it is her birthday FRIDAY?

Fuck this guy. One of the last things she has to look forward to in the short term is that in a few days she'll be able to celebrate her birth. And because she doesn't want that one day to be ruined by an intrusive police investigation and scandal, she is apprehensive about reporting it. Yet to this guy, who can't even fathom what she's going through, that's all the proof he needs that she's making it all up.

&gt;Either it happened and she is looking for attention desperately

Uh, yes. All human communication that has ever existed is looking for attention by the very fact that it's being said. She's looking for attention because she's looking for *help*, and Internet Detective drops this line like that's the worst thing in the world. ""Ooh look, another feeeemale looking for ATTENTION amiriteguys""

&gt;why else would she come here if she won't listen to advice, keep dating him and won't go to the cops?

Yes, sir, you figured it out. This person isn't a rape survivor, they just felt like making up a huge, detailed story with photos on an anonymous account on Reddit. If it weren't for you, she would have gotten away with the many things she would have to gain in that situation, including... oh wait, there's *no reason someone would make this up*. What motive could they possibly have to do something like that? They're not incriminating anyone, they gain nothing from posting the story online, they have no incentive to do something like this.

Finally, [one more Internet Detective \[+11\].](http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/zp0mp/he_was_drunk_and_terrified_me/c66ihbc) There are more, but I'm getting too sick to keep doing this. 

&gt;Ok, so I'm not trying to be a dick but how was he throat fucking you and biting at the same time? 

This doesn't take much thought. He was lying on top of her.

&gt;From how many times you mentioned him playing with your breasts and how many times you kept saying he throat fucked you. I'm sorry if I seem insensitive but it just seems like a fap story to me.

And she would have gotten away with it, if only she didn't use so many details.

The OP responds to this post, but it's heavily downvoted because a significant chunk of the hivemind can be convinced that anyone is faking anything with zero evidence or logic. 

I know this isn't a very good effortpost, but I'm honestly so upset by this thread that it's hard for me to think clearly.

Obviously the above comments are extremely problematic, but you might be surprised that the image post in question didn't even make it near the front page of r/pics.

[This](http://www.reddit.com/r/ImGoingToHellForThis/comments/1axfp6/i_was_just_stating_a_fact/) is the thread that frontpaged on /r/all and is currently sits at the number 4 spot overall. Notice that in the screencap, the top-level racist-as-fuck comment sits at -9. Now, an hour later, that comment has over 400 upvotes. 

Normally, /r/ImGoingToHellForThis is low-hanging fruit and fairly easy to ignore, but they are now actively encouraging their readers to go elsewhere on reddit and bombard comment sections with their...*ignorance*. In this case, Reddit isn't just organically making racist comments on mainstream subreddits and upvoting them blindly; they're actively recognizing that these comments are shitlord-y, posting screenshots, and egging on the shitlords.

Warren Farrell is doing an IAmA right now. I'm not linking to it because I'm asking y'all to keep your circlejerking contained to this post/SRS and not in his AMA simply because it's always more fun to jerk in the Prime and I think we all want to see him answer some actual questions about, for example, all the fucked up shit he has said below:

[From](http://manboobz.com/2012/11/21/what-mens-rights-guru-warren-farrell-actually-said-about-the-allegedly-positive-aspects-of-incest-note-its-even-more-repugnant-than-that-sounds/): 

&gt; Mother-son incest represents 10 percent of the incidence and is 70 percent positive, 20 percent mixed, and 10 percent negative for the son. For the mother it is mostly positive. **Farrell points out that boys don’t seem to suffer, not even from the negative experience. “Girls are much more influenced by the dictates of society and are more willing to take on sexual guilt**.”

That quote literally is a case of actual misandry.

Also:

&gt; The father-daughter scene, ineluctably complicated by feelings of dominance and control, is not nearly so sanguine. Despite some advertisements, calling explicitly for positive female experiences, Farrell discovered that 85 percent of the daughters admitted to having negative attitudes toward their incest. Only 15 percent felt positive about the experience. **On the other hand, statistics from the vantage of the fathers involved were almost the reverse — 60 percent positive 10 percent mixed, and 20 percent negative. “Either men see these relationships differently,” comments Farrell, “or I am getting selective reporting from women.”**

Also:

&gt; In a typical traumatic case, an authoritarian father, unhappily married in a sexually repressed household and probably unemployed, drunkenly imposes himself on his young daughter. **Genital petting may have started as early as age eight with first intercourse occurring around twelve. Since the father otherwise extends very little attention to his daughter, his sexual advances may be one of the few pleasant experiences she has with him.**

Also:

&gt; “When I get my most glowing positive cases, 6 out of 200, the incest is part of the family’s open, sensual style of life, wherein sex is an outgrowth of warmth and affection. **It is more likely that the father has good sex with his wife, and his wife is likely to know and approve — and in one or two cases to join in [the incest].**”

[Also](http://articles.latimes.com/1993-08-09/news/vw-22148_1_feminist-warren-farrell):

&gt; Sexual harassment legislation is a male-only chastity belt. With women holding the key.

Also:

&gt; The powerful woman doesn't feel the effect of her secretary's miniskirt power, cleavage power and flirtation power. Men do.

&gt;
&gt;I understand there is probably more to the story than 'he tells you and bam the wedding's off,' however it's the reaction in the comments that bothers me. People think it's okay to desert someone because they have the urge for pedophilia? This kind of intolerance is part of the problem, without the support of loved ones how would you fare in battling any of your weaknesses?

Anyways, [here](http://reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/16jfs7/wow_that_escalated_quickly/) is a link to a video of domestic abuse. A (much larger) man corners a woman, pushes her with her back into her television, starts acting like a gorilla and kicks it. The woman then tries to push back, and at this ""provocation"" (self defense) he beats her and she starts crying. The kids are clearly distressed by this. All the comments are about how they both were bad and the woman instigated the violence:

[Both are equally to blame +32](http://np.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/16jfs7/wow_that_escalated_quickly/c7wm0v0)

And then there are the response, which completely blames the woman, and advocates violence against women, which is at +33:

&gt;Then when he attempts to bypass her physical barrier she escalates the situation into actual violence. Maybe this wasn't intentional, but if it was I've seen women intentionally do stupid shit just because she knows it'll set him off. And if that is the case, she got what she deserved, and then started crying when she realized the door she had opened. I don't advocate unnecessary violence against women, particularly in front of their children. However, depending on the person, a certain amount of violence is necessary, if for no other reason than to realize how powerless they really are to change the situation they landed themselves in. Some people need to realize that they WILL be held accountable for their actions.

If you want to rape children, you need help. If you want to rape *a subset of children,* it's obviously because you just care about them *too damn much* and want to protect them!

You see, it's because men get all confused! And they're slaves to their **HORMONAL IMPULSES** to protect young children!

[](/dicktater)

&amp;nbsp;

Of course, not everyone agreed, which is why Kaizer_Soze edited that first comment to cross out the final sentence. What *did* Reddit disagree with?

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

**Dangerous schism among pedo apologists! THE UNITY HAS BEEN DISRUPTED!**

****

Of course, we have the usual pedophile peanut gallery downthread. Here's an interesting development:

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;&gt; [pedophilia is no more a ""disorder"" than homosexuality&amp;hellip; From an evolutionary standpoint they both represent failure, but the difference is consent. (+21)](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/113ii8/eli5_the_lolita_effect/c6j40p0)

I could call your attention to the old pedophilia = homosexuality canard. I could call your attention to how Reddit's main problem with pedophilia is &amp;ldquo;from an evolutionary standpoint,&amp;rdquo; and the reply clarified that it is, in fact, the *only* problem. I could call your attention to how nobody here understands how *disorder* is actually a *medically-defined term.* But that's nothing new.

Instead, let me call your attention to one unique dynamic here: A pedo apologist replied to another pedo apologist because they weren't being *enough* of a pedo apologist. And let me also point out, the first comment is at (31|10) right now and the second (27|0). Straying from the pedo apologist orthodoxy = downvotes.

But wait, that wasn't the only reply!

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; [Hmm, I never really thought about homosexuality as a disorder, I suppose strictly speaking it is a non-destructive disorder (+8)](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/113ii8/eli5_the_lolita_effect/c6j49a2)

That's got to be a first. A pedo apologist brings out the canard that if pedophilia is a disorder, homosexuality must be too &amp;ndash; and someone just turns back and says &amp;ldquo;you know what? homosexuality *is* a disorder!&amp;rdquo; **IT'S THE 1950s UP IN HURR!**

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

**What does this thread need? MORE PEDO APOLOGY!**

Has Reddit *ever* said &amp;ldquo;okay fellas, pack it up; child rapists have been sufficiently defended today&amp;rdquo;? Is there an off-button on the pedo apology reflex?

&amp;nbsp;

Remember, whenever someone says &amp;ldquo;if there's grass on the field, play ball!&amp;rdquo; it's just a **TOP GEAR JOKE**! Nobody would *ever* say that seriously, and even if someone did &amp;ndash; which they wouldn't, not in a million years &amp;ndash; they'd be downvoted to oblivion.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; [It is perfectly normal, just not sanctioned by this society (assuming you live in the US.)

So, I'd seen /r/Creepshots mentioned once or twice recently, and a link in /r/funny led me there to see exactly how terrible it was. And it is one of the most infuriating and saddest examples of this stuff that I've ever seen. Clearly, this is not one of the most highly-publicized subreddits, but it's getting mentioned relatively frequently, and while there's been some disgust, there's also been some approval.

How does this lovely community describe itself?

&gt;Creepshots are CANDID. **If a person is posing for and/or aware that a picture is being taken, then it ceases to be candid and thus is no longer a creepshot.** A creepshot captures the natural, raw sexiness of the subject without their vain attempts at putting on a show for the camera. That is the essence of the creepshot, that is what makes a true creepshot worth the effort and **that is why we're all proud to be creepers.**

Awesome.

&gt;Message the mods anytime, we are a friendly bunch and are here to help.

No you're not, you're a terrible bunch and you're here to endorse and commit sex crimes and make sure some of us never feel safe ever.

&gt;About 2/3 of them are first-timers I've **coaxed** into trying it... many of whom I've **deceived** into their first, and often last, prostitution experience. (I typically indicate that they'll become my mistress for thousands of dollars per month, then never call for a second date after **defiling** them for $150). They don't know about the camera, except one who discovered it.""

Nearly every comment is encouraging OP to post the videos. I didn't read every single one in the longest comment thread (which we'll get to later,) but it looked like they were all encouraging OP. Not even a single hint of doubt or the thought that it might be okay. I don't know why I expected better from this community.

&gt;No joking, I'd LOVE to see the one where she found the cam, specifically the look on her face when she realizes. I've a huge voyeurism fetish, and while the clips may not real fit here, could you PM me about getting a copy. [+27]

yes i would love to see the look on the face of a person who has just realized that she has been violated
i am rape culture given human form

Oh, look! A heavily downvoted post! Could it be someone with a shred of respect for other people telling OP how terrible this is?
Oh, wow, it's a mod! And they're even saying
&gt;MOD here, no, this is not the correct forum. [-15]

Are they trying to inject the tiniest bit of decency into this community dedicated to violating people and sharing the records for all to see?!

&gt; /r/creepshots is for candid street shots, not home made sex videos (hot as they may be). Sorry. Maybe post them to motherless.com and share the links with people who request them via pm?

Oh.
...Oh.
.......I think I might throw up.

OP replies, and cue over 150 posts, almost every single one asking OP to PM the videos to them.
About 150 people are in on this. Around one hundred and fifty individual human beings think violation and rape are acceptable, awesome, and hot, and want the video.

This is disgusting. I'm sorry for the lack of screenshots, and I'm sorry if this post is low quality, but I just can't do any more. If anyone wants to, feel free to go in yourselves and take screenshots or post more of the replies or whatever else. I'm going to try not to cry.

I just... I can't... Is it so much to ask people to have the tiniest iota of respect for other human beings? Sometimes I just want to give up on humanity.


(Also... as a socially awkward person, who's sad that social awkwardness is often associated with creepiness, I think I'd appreciate it if we kept any benign awkwardness these vile people may or may not have out of the discussion. There's more than enough in there to make us all sick without resorting to that.)

**UPDATE:** Holy fucking shit, he posted a picture of the face of the woman who caught him videotaping her. It's right there in the thread, but... I wouldn't recommend it for anyone who cares about people.

Reddit user /u/combatwombater posted a [thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/qse0k/got_dumped_by_the_love_of_my_life_so_i_chopped) recently in [/r/pics](/r/pics). Here is the picture she posted:

[Oooh!](http://i.imgur.com/2o0Ii.jpg)

In the thread she explains that she decided to chop off her locks after breaking up with her partner. Presumably, one might think posting this to reddit is some sort of cathartic release. Perhaps she's looking for encouragement, or a ""you go girl!"" sort of response. And of course, that's entirely all right. We are all of us human. We like to feel wanted, accepted, and a part of things.

Unless you're a redditor, of course. Redditors revel in the fact that they are nihilistic disgusting shitbags and hate that anyone else should enter their space and not fit the profile. So let's see how they reacted to this lady's pictures.

---

From the very start, people were complaining about karma-whoring and how much of a bitch the lady is. So I was of course pleased to see this as the top comment, apparently admonishing the community for being disgusting creepy fuckfaces,

So there we have it. For so long we have seen redditors own the pretention that they are part of a good community. A caring community. A community that has empathy for others. One that donates to charity and helps out people in need. A moral force for good in the world. But no longer.

Nope. Now reddit is filled with shitbags who are entirely aware that they are shitbags, and are okay with this. The shittest of members are unironically venerated as something to aspire to. The values of shitbags have crept into the reddit consciousness. Redditors don't even believe their own bullshit about being a good community any more. Reddit is place that hates whores, bitches, women and phonies. And they're pleased with this state of affairs. I wonder if they'll ever be any less angry, though.

Let's Play!,313,114,78,http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/12ve1y/reddit_or_stormfront_lets_play/,"Welcome, Scorntroopers, to the new edition of our long standing series, Guess The Hate Site! The game is simple: a list of comments is posted, and you have to guess whether they come from reddit or Stormfront's forum.

Today's game title is ""Five Muslim extremists attacked a gay club in Paris beating the bouncers and spraying some attendants, including the vice president of IDAHO, with tear gas""

Ready to play? let's go!

1.

&gt; its just the religion of peace folks, nothing to see here. 

2.

&gt; This is what I dont understand - why any self-respecting progressive liberal would support mass immmigration of people who are [1] anything but  liberal and progressive?

3.

&gt; Speaking a modicum of English and filling in all the required paperwork is NOT ENOUGH. You really must demonstrate that you WANT to be British, or American, or Canadian, and not just to continue being Indian, Pakistani etc complete with your own laws and backwards religions and practices brought from your homeland.

4.

&gt; The bouncers and the club-goers need to realize that this was not an attack but just an enhanced facet of the vibrancy of vigorous multi-culturalism. 

5.

&gt; It is hard to move forward when we keep immigrating people living in the stone age into our society. They bring with them a backwards and often violent culture. They don't wish to adapt and move forward, they're stuck in time.

6.

&gt; If they are French-born, just throw them in a hole for the rest of their lives for terrorism. 

7.

&gt; Throw them out of France. We don't need them here, or next door. They're against what we believe in. We do not need to share a land with them. Their aim is not to integrate, but to ""settle"" and procreate. They don't want to be a part of the west, they want to replace it with the east.

8.

&gt; Shhh, we call them ""youths"", not Muslim Extremists.

9.

&gt; Such a peace loving religion.

10.

&gt; I'm sure the Muslim community will be outraged that some of it's members committed such an atrocity. I mean, it's not like Islam is violent or anything. 

11.

&gt; And that's basically what happens when you fail to understand the difference between ""granting citizenship to those who will bring good"" and ""letting anyone in"".

12.

&gt; Muslim apologists that are just as ignorant as the 'extremists'. Y'all need to fuck off and either A) get the fuck out of the 'West' or B) Stop attacking our way of life. People are gay, girls talk to boys, and your prophet was a pedophile. Deal with it. 

13.

&gt; Here come the apologists for savag.. I mean muslims. Go on, tell us how it is all the fault of the West and that we are 'Islamophobes'.

14.

&gt; Extremist Mulsims are taking over Europe, and no one wants to do anything about it. They HATE the western world, so they need to get out.

15.

&gt; 8-10% of France is Muslim (6 million people). France needs their own reconquista.

So, how did you guess? was it 50-50, was it more or less all Stormfront or reddit?

Well if you answered 'yes' to the last question I have good news for ya!

[+7]",284,92,156,http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/yhz8q/trigger_warning_domestic_violence_mra_article/,"###Seriously, trigger warning for DV

So a few months back the owner of In Mala Fide, a mens rights site, wrote ""The Necessity of Domestic Violence"". It's exactly what the title says. [Here's a mirror I made of it](http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSBusiness/comments/qa0qa/X/c5ecrkm), but seriously don't fucking read it if you even remotely think it might affect you. It's pretty much the worst article ever. Let me just quote one line from it, so you get what I'm talking about here:

&gt;Women should be terrorized by their men; it’s the only thing that makes them behave better than chimps.

Anyway, r/FeMRA decides to have a discussion about it! Unsurprisingly, some of them support it. The following post is by ghebert001.

&gt;I think that in most discussions on domestic violence, not only are we told that men are bad, women are victims, but we're also led to believe that men beat women just because. Maybe dinner was overcooked, maybe she put too much eyeliner on, maybe it was Tuesday...I would assume the majority of men who hit their girlfriends or wives don't do it ""just because""...they do it because the woman keeps emotionally manipulating and abusing the poor guy to the point where, non-violent as he may be, he reaches his breaking point, snaps and then proceeds to lay the smackdown as they say. Violence is not okay, but sometimes it's inevitable.

'domestic violence is bad, but...'

And then GirlWritesWhat shows up:

&gt;&gt;&gt;[I used to live under a young couple with a baby. I'd listen as she followed him from room to room upstairs, stomping, slamming things, throwing things, screaming. After about an hour, he'd eventually hit her, and everything would go quiet. An hour after that, they'd be out with the baby in the stroller, looking perfectly content with each other.](http://www.reddit.com/r/FeMRA/comments/y0nod/X/c5rjmh3?context=1)

&gt;&gt;&gt;A man I know who has experience with men in abusive relationships would get his clients to answer a questionare. Things like, ""after the violence, did you have sex?"" ""If so, how would you rate the sex?"" 100% of men in reciprocally abusive relationships said ""yes"" to the first, and ""scorching"" to the second.

&gt;&gt;&gt;He also posited that the much-quoted cycle of violence--the build-up, the explosion, the honeymoon period--correlates with foreplay, orgasm and post-coital bliss.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Erin Pizzey called it ""consensual violence"", and said in the main, that was the type she'd see at her shelter. It is also the type that results in the most severe injuries in women, surprise surprise, likely because our ""never EVER hit a woman"" mentality has those men waiting until they completely lose control of their emotions before giving their women what they're demanding.

&gt;&gt;&gt;The DV in Sleeping with the Enemy is the most rare form out there, half as common as ""matriarchal terrorism"", and injuries are typically less severe. It's seriously foolish to treat all cases like the most rare type, and refuse to address women's instigation and participation in violence.

&gt;&gt;&gt;**I don't really find too much in the article that strikes me as seriously ethically questionable.** DV isn't pretty. Neither is the article.

&gt;&gt;Correct me if I'm wrong, but a good summary of what you're saying is ""Violence isn't right but a slap here and there is better than the guy taking all of her nagging and exploding in such a way that he beats her within an inch of her life"".

&gt;[That's pretty much it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/FeMRA/comments/y0nod/jto_brought_up_the_point_so_here_it_is_ferdinand/c5rl768?context=3)

&gt;I also think it would be good for women to take boxing or karate or some other form of training, not only because it helps you be more confident in your ability to defend yourself against muggings and stuff like that, but that would demonstrate to women that getting hit isn't going to break them into little pieces. Women aren't made out of spun glass, and allowing them to believe they are does them no favors.

Yep, beating women a little bit is better than beating women a lot and it's basically inevitable so don't bother to stop it! Oh and women should take martial arts so that we learn not to be scared of being beaten.

Basically, fuck everything.

To try to rectifiy that, I have taken a couple of glances into it for the period, and logged the most egregious cases; I didn't read it more than superficially so let me assure you that my list of MR poop is by no means exhaustive. Do not let this post dissuade you from making similar shitmining operations yourself.

First, an important mens issue: [Should men get a say in the abortion?](http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/o7x50/should_men_get_a_say_in_abortion/)

Top comment:
&gt;Just give men the ability to renounce fatherhood.

So short, so succinct. I guess this is how it feels to be logic'd! 

___

Then another: [Does anyone else hate the whole ""You're so different from other men"" Speech? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/o718i/does_anyone_else_hate_the_whole_youre_so/)

Top comment: 
&gt;The correct response is ""fuck you and your trying to friendzone me using sexist comments""

This submission is also a bit sad, since the OP turns out to be a 17 year old. I don't think r/MR is a healthy place to be for a person in his formative years :/ [This one is even worse](http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/odmz4/i_am_a_14_year_old_boy_and_i_want_to_join_the/)  
___

[Won't someone think of the rapists?](http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/oaxlz/guy_beats_up_accused_rapist_of_his_friend_has_no/c3fv8j1)

&gt;On another note. It's kind of fucked up that our culture has such an unusual amount of hatred towards rapists.

___

But r/MR is not only for people who hates women. It also brainstorms about [ways in which the MRM can help women](http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/o7ibc/ways_in_which_the_mrm_can_help_women/). Top comment:
&gt;This is like asking why you should teach your children discipline.[...]
&gt;Hell, most of us aren't even asking for men to be treated as well as women. We are asking for women to not be treated SO MUCH better than men.

There you got it boys, straight from the horses mouth - MRA's are not first and foremost about treating men better, but about treating women worse - MRA's in a nutshell.

___

The above principle is embodied in this post: [""Here's an example of how and why many people believe that rape is everywhere... because their definition of rape includes every sexual misadventure""](http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/ovwah/heres_an_example_of_how_and_why_many_people/)

The link is to a case of r/atheism victim-blaming which was featured on reddit. The comments are surprisingly reasonable, altho that might be because it was SRS'd. Be certain to look up gems from the submitter, Whisper. At least hardwarequestions gives us the usual MRA fare when he says that ""AppleGods(victim) sounds like a delusional sheltered teen. Forget her.""  
___

If there is one thing MRA's are horrified at, it is women. When [this picture](http://i.imgur.com/8eJT4.jpg) is posted to MRA under the headline [""Is anyone else seeing this image around now, and find it similarly upsetting?""](http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/oy939/is_anyone_else_seeing_this_image_around_now_and/), the top comment is the following gem:

&gt;I am afraid of you. I am afraid you will decide that I am looking at your boobs and successfully sue me for sexual harassment. I am afraid you will get drunk and hit on me, then the sexual harassment thing again. I am afraid to speak to you for fear you might in some way, somehow, decide what I have said offends your femininity, again with the suing. I am afraid not to talk to you, because not talking to you and talking to others represents being sexist and is therefore sexual harassment (this actually happened to me, I almost got fired). I am afraid to sleep with you because you might decide it was rape. I am afraid to not sleep with you because you might accuse me of rape to get even, and today that accusation is as bad as having done the deed. I am afraid to fall in love with you because you would have sole control over any and all children we have until birth, when I pick up financial responsibility for said children even if I didn't want sad children.

&gt;Yes, I am afraid of you, but I shouldn't have to be.

I also know for sure that no one will be surprised when they find out that [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/orsnn/brothelowningredditor_attacked_and_downvoted_for/) was hit hard by the MRA's.

Bonus:
&gt;Oh let's just say what we already know here. When it comes to rape, feminists consider ""innocent until proven guilty"" a nuisance they'd like to get rid of.

&gt;They got rid of it already. They just try to further increase the burden of proof to prove one's innocence.

Or is it...? Nope! Top comment:

&gt;This sounds perfectly reasonable to me (assuming she didn't coerce the teen in any way). Now let's start sentencing males in a similar situation the same way and I'll be happy.

I'm sure there are more equalists out there that *also* can't wait to make their 16 year old students pregnant!

Rape apologist and PUA extraordinaire BobSutan has a diverse portfolio of hobbies. When not harassing rape victims, he also [fights the good fight against inhumane prison practices](http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/orp4x/debtors_prisons_are_alive_and_well_in_the_us/)

&gt;An estimated 50,000 people, mainly men, are in jail in the US for owing money.

How this ties into MR issues is not immediately apparent; but the reason is that some of these men are in prison for not paying child protection money to the pussy mafia, as the third comment points out to people like me, who didn't get that connection at first.

In this highly upvoted post, one of the highest on the frontpage at thetime of its posting I think, we learn that [girls r gross!](http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/okho8/dear_mensrights/)

&gt;Since preschool, I've gravitated more towards females for friends. They seemed more compassionate and less crude( I know that I'll catch a lot of shit for that) but more recently, I've gotten a chance to see how very wrong younger me was. I've seen people turn on me in a flash. And I'll tell you one thing. All were women. I'm not saying that all of my female friends abandoned me, one or two stayed. But a vast majority left me. But my male friends(However small) stayed by my side. This was not at all misogynistic, they just didn't believe that I did it. Which leads me to a time honored conclusion. Women judge Men as rapists until proven innocent.

The kid can be forgiven for having and idiotic opinion; he is 15. The rest of MR that upvotes this so highly, cannot.

One category has been kinda underrepresented in these posts. I look to rectify this in [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/nzo8p/media_focus_on_rapes_and_other_female_miseries/), in which we are treated to the mother of all ""**what about the menz**"" posts. 

&gt;My concern with this article comes from what’s missing—at least up until the very end. “I’m still chilled by the matter-of-fact explanation I received as to why it is women who collect firewood, even though they’re the ones who are raped,” says Kristof. “‘It’s simple,’ one woman here explained. ‘When the men go out, they’re killed. The women are only raped.’”

&gt;Well, that new information changes things a bit, doesn’t it? So why then could this editorial not be titled “A Policy of Murder”? Why is all its emphasis on the rape of women and none of its emphasis on the murder of men?

&gt;Because men are inherently disposable and meant to die in wars silly.

This one was also highly upvoted. Bonus from that post:

There is a [buttload of poop](http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/1cm6zj/i_know_this_will_be_controversial_but_society/) going on over in /r/sex right now. 

/u/Maxxters submitted [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=hE9FFvIYPg8) which attempts to place sexual assault within its broader social context. In this case, the scenario follows a women who goes out to a club and gets progressively drunker until she is verifiably wasted; eventually she is led out of the club and taken back to her home by a man who intends to have sex with her, even though she is clearly too drunk to consent, enthusiastically or otherwise. The video uses the scenario to urge individuals to take action if they feel that anyone is too drunk to be fully cognizant of the situation or to give consent, uncomfortable, or unsafe. Understanding and acting on nonverbal cues of potential discomfort or lack of safety is a central part of the video. [TRIGGER WARNING on the video and on the comments.]

But luckily the redditors of /r/sex are prepared to call this video on its shit.

I click to open the comments.

Victim blaming... victim blaming *everywhere*.

And /u/librtee_com wins gold.

&gt; [I agree; all these people should step in and help her.
But there is one person who is overlooked as having a responsibility to step in and avert this: the woman herself.
I find it rather shocking that at no place in this video does it suggest that the woman should avoid drinking herself into a stupor. That the sole responsibility for avoiding the rape falls on those around her.
Again, they SHOULD help. But binge drinking is inherently dangerous, and this video seems to take it for granted and even encourage it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/1cm6zj/i_know_this_will_be_controversial_but_society/c9hwvl6) [+45 -- +75/-30]

/u/Dubstercat agrees, and [thinks that a PSA to this effect should be added to the end of the video](http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/1cm6zj/i_know_this_will_be_controversial_but_society/c9hz45h) [+11 -- +16/-6]. 

[](/ironicat)

/u/Maxxters steps in with what is clearly a controversial interjection: 

&gt; [Binge drinking is one thing. Rape and sexual assault are completely different. When a person chooses to binge drink, they are not choosing to be sexually assaulted.](http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/1cm6zj/i_know_this_will_be_controversial_but_society/c9hx3ad) [+4 -- +49/-44]

But /u/librtee_com is onto her totally misogynistic outlook on the situation: 

&gt; [If I make a video suggesting you shouldn't walk through the ghetto at 3AM, am I supporting robbery?
No. It's just common sense.
Binge drinking is not 'wrong,' it's just potentially dangerous. Guy, girl, at home, at a club, in your home town, in a foreign country - binge drinking is a potentially dangerous activity. Fact.
This video steps through every person and what they can do to help this person, and yet totally ignores any steps the woman herself could have taken to protect herself.
It just paints the woman as this hapless victim who is in no control over her life, who just bumbles through passively going along without a thought into an obviously dangerous situation, and there is nothing she can do about it.
In fact, this video infuriates me. The whole 'don't blame the victim' line infuriates me. It is dis-empowering, it teaches women to be hapless victims who have no control over their lives, who have no self-determination or ability to fight back, who are just easy targets of rape until some white knight on a horse comes along and saves them.
Fuck that. The creepy guy shouldn't have done what he did. The bystanders should have done something. But fuck, if you really think we shouldn't discuss what the woman can do to avoid the situation, you have a really twisted and demeaning idea of women.](http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/1cm6zj/i_know_this_will_be_controversial_but_society/c9hxi0y) [+47 -- +70/-23]

Yes, we need to be concentrating on empowering victims of rape and sexual assault by allowing them to shoulder their rightful burden of responsibility! If you knowingly decide to drink a lotta drinks, you should expect and prepare to be raped. (But ""All men are rapists!"" is misandry!! Isn't it?) 

[](/ironicat)

/u/Sionainn gets honourable mention in this category: 

&gt; [I'm sorry but where's the part about the chick taking responsibility for herself by not drinking so much she can't control her actions. This is putting the blame for her actions on everyone else. Obviously the guy is trying to get her drunk and take advantage, BUT she is a grown up who got drunk on her own. I'm tired of everyone being blamed except for the woman.](http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/1cm6zj/i_know_this_will_be_controversial_but_society/c9hvir9) [+19 -- +51/-32]

**""I am sick of everyone being blamed for rape except the rape victim, goddamnit! SICK!""**

But although our gold medal in victim-blaming is a shoe-in, the competition for **Best Irony** is a little tighter. Let's take a look at our competitors:

/u/sexinthepark was left a little confused by the whole thing:

&gt; [There was no way for those random strangers to know that she was unwilling to have sex, nor that the guy wasn't her bf or fwb. She never expresses any discomfort. I know that lack of consent is not the same as consent, but she kisses him, she dances with him, they go back to her apartment. How is anyone supposed to know that she doesn't want sex?](http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/1cm6zj/i_know_this_will_be_controversial_but_society/c9hztrv) [+50 -- +62/-12]

&gt; There was no way for those random strangers to know

&gt; **How is anyone supposed to know?**

[](/ironicat)

/u/raebear serves up a piping hot dose of irony with a shot of Special Snowflake:

&gt; [Am I the only woman in the world who thinks that getting drunk and having sex isn't the same as being raped? I don't see what happened in this video as being sexual assault. Did she say ""no"" anywhere in the video? Did I miss that part?](http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/1cm6zj/i_know_this_will_be_controversial_but_society/c9hzbaq) [+36 -- +51/-15]

[](/ironicat)

/u/Maxxters appears throughout the thread valiantly replying to comments like these, but again, her reply to /u/raebear's comment leaves the /r/sex community divided: 

&gt; [Do you really believe that the woman in the video actually wanted to have sex? And that she was in a state where she was capable of saying no? You don't believe that the man in the video was taking advantage of her?
That's terrifying that just because she didn't say ""no"", you don't believe anything was wrong here. No, just having drunken sex isn't rape. It's the absence of enthusiastic consent that is the problem. It's obvious she was uncomfortable with the situation, yet didn't have the capacity to stop what was happening.](http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/1cm6zj/i_know_this_will_be_controversial_but_society/c9hzf6o) [+0 -- +27/-27]

But /u/raebear isn't about to cotton to all this bullcrap. *She* would never be incapable of saying ""no.""

&gt; [When are we ever in a state where we're incapable of saying no? Unless I'm unconscious or dead or have too much peanut butter in my mouth, I can form the word ""no.""](http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/1cm6zj/i_know_this_will_be_controversial_but_society/c9i04x0) [+28 -- +39/-11]

&gt; When are we ever in a state where we're incapable of saying no?

(Some bonus general horrificness here): 

&gt; Unless I'm unconscious or dead

&gt; **Unless I'm unconscious or dead**

[Yup.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steubenville_High_School_rape_case)

/u/dz1262 wants to break it all down to the facts in a step-by-step analysis of the situation: 

&gt; [Amount of drinks he forced her to drink. 0
Home they went back to. Hers.
Action he took when he first came up to dance and she didn't want to. He stopped.
Amount of alcohol he was also drinking. A hell of a lot too.
Amount of drinks he spikes? Zero
Amount of the conversation we hear on whose idea it was to do what? Zero.
Regretting a your decision to have sex is not rape. Not remembering having sex is not rape.](http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/1cm6zj/i_know_this_will_be_controversial_but_society/c9i1pcg) [+31 -- +43/-12]

&gt; **Not remembering having sex is not rape**

Anyway, SRS. I'm outta juice. Suffice it to say that considering the **EXACT FUCKING POINT OF THE VIDEO**, the level of irony in this comment thread is on the ridiculous.

This is because SRS is literally run by goons.*

It's my first effort post since my return! Hooray!

Brad Wardell, CEO of Stardock, is not a good person. [He's actually a very bad person](http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/95062-Stardock-CEO-Boycotts-UPS-Over-Fox-News).

But up until very recently, the whole world did not know just how bad of a person he really is. That all changed today when [Kotaku actually did some great journalism and took a gigantic shit all over this piece of sexist garbage](http://kotaku.com/5940401/pc-gaming-studio-said-she-ruined-their-game-but-only-after-she-sued-the-boss-for-sexual-harassment).

You can read the article to get a really detailed timeline of what happened, but in the interest of brevity, here's a very short summary (with quotes from Kotaku). Lmao, it's not short at all.

From 2008 to 2010, Stardock CEO Brad Wardell repeatedly sexually harassed Alexandra Miseta, the manager of marketing; the harassment was physical, verbal, and electronic

&gt; E-mail messages included in the records go back as far as March, 2008, and include a link to a sexually explicit YouTube video, a comment that Miseta was chosen to go to a conference ""not just because you're 'hot',"" and **a 100-question 'purity test' that he asked her to take and then send him her score from.** The purity test includes questions like, ""Have you engaged in group sex?,"" 'Have you engaged in intercourse with an unconscious person, while conscious?,"" and, ""Have you had anal intercourse?""

&gt; Witness depositions included in the case documents refer to **multiple comments from Wardell to female employees about their breast and bra sizes**, and **one incident where he asked Miseta to attend a media tour because ""[her] nipples look better on TV.""** They also describe a time on a media tour when Wardell's visit to the hotel room Miseta and another female colleague were sharing made Miseta feel uncomfortable.

&gt; In May 2010, during a dinner on a media tour, **Wardell touched Miseta's hair**.

That last bit of physical harassment led to Miseta emailing Wardell and making an extremely professional and polite email to **her harasser**. Here is an excerpt:

&gt; 1. Please never touch my hair or any of my body parts; not even jokingly.

&gt; 2. Please do not talk about my private life or about my boyfriend/future husband in any terms especially negative terms.

&gt; 3. Please be careful with your ""jokes"" which are at many times inappropriate, sexist, vulgar and very embarrassing not only to me, but everyone present.

&gt; 4. Please keep your negative personal opinions of others (including family members and/or coworkers) not present at the time of your comments, to yourself. I feel, at times, it puts me in a very uncomfortable position.

&gt; With the above few behavioral changes, I'm hoping our previously friendly and professional relationship can be reestablished.

Wow! What a nice email; I'm sure Brad will respond in kind! And he actually does in the beginning with ""Thank you for bringing these up to me as I certainly do not want you to feel uncomfortable at work."" But all the basic human decency dies right there:

&gt; 3, **however is not acceptable to me. I am an inappropriate, sexist, vulgar, and embarrassing person and I'm not inclined to change my behavior. If this is a problem, you will need to find another job.**

&gt; 4, Again, I am not willing to adapt my behavior to suit others. IF you find my behavior problematic, I recommend finding another job.

&gt; **I'm not some manager or coworker of yours. I own the company. It, and your job here, exist to suit my purposes**, not vice versa. **The company is not an end unto itself, it is a means to an end which is to further the objectives of its shareholders (in this case, me).**

[...]

&gt; I sincerely apologize for offending you while on our trip. I certainly would never intentionally try to upset you or make you uncomfortable and will endeavor to avoid doing so in the future. **However, I won't change my basic personality to suit anyone (i.e. being an inappropriate, sexist, vulgar and embarrassing person)**.

Huh! Taking his advice to leave, Alexandra does leave her horrible job at Stardock. But the story doesn't end there!

Shortly after she leaves in August 2010, Stardock releases Elemental, one massive turd of a game. [Like, a really profoundly anaconda of unrequited fecal matter](http://kotaku.com/5662673/developer-turns-to-mod-maker-to-fix-broken-game). In December of 2010, Alexandra files a lawsuit against Wardell for sexual harassment. But how are these two things related? I'll get back to that in a hot minute.

Well, lawsuits involving sexual harassment take a long ass time. *Miseta v. Wardell* has been working its way through the court system for the last year and a half and it was actually the summer of this year for the court to hear arguments about the motion to dismiss the Miseta's claim. On July 13, the judge denied the motion to dismiss.

Wardell mad. He real mad.

So remember like two paragraphs back how I talked about Elemental being a horrible game? **Three weeks after Wardell loses the motion to dismiss**, Stardock filed a complaint against Miseta for $1 million in damages. Their claim is that ""Miseta ""deleted, destroyed, and/or stole"" the Elemental marketing materials, analytics, and trade show information"". Huh! That's a quite serious allegation! Let's see what people who worked at the company say...

&gt; Witness statements found in the response from Miseta's attorneys, however, contradict the claim. **One employee specifically testified in her deposition that Miseta gave her a week's advance notice that she would be leaving Stardock, so that she ""knew where [Miseta's] files were"" and had access to relevant Google docs. Others had no recollection of Wardell or HR manager Angela Marshall (Wardell's sister-in-law) ever mentioning missing documents causing trouble with Elemental.**

&gt; **A former Stardock employee, speaking with Kotaku on the condition of anonymity, confirmed that a mere two weeks before launch, Elemental had many technical issues that had nothing to do with its marketing. The employee also added that at the time, nobody mentioned any materials having gone missing or any sabotage having taken place and showed Kotaku communications from Wardell that indicated satisfaction with how Miseta's staff replacement was taking over the review kit and review guide process**.

Right, so Wardell isn't just a huge misogynist and sexist piece of shit; he's also a filthy god damn liar.

*Sidenote: How fucked up is it that the HR person is fucking related to the sexual-harassment-happy CEO? Jeez, what a friendly and safe workplace!*

TL;DR: **Woman gets sexually harassed by a dudebro and stands up for herself. Dudebro doubles down on his misogyny and tells her to leave. She leaves and then sues his ass. Dudebro tries to get the case dismissed but fails miserably. Dudebro is super mad and then makes up some total bullshit about how the woman helped fuck up a game that was actually complete ass for totally unrelated reasons.**

Now, you'll be forgiven for thinking it ends there. But god damn, [we've only just begun](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__VQX2Xn7tI)!

You see, Wardell likes to post god awful shit on the internet. He likes to post a lot of god awful shit on the internet. And to the guaranteed horror and frustration of his legal counsel, he just *loves* to dig himself deeper online. I'll just post links and highlights as it gets all pretty wordy along with images from Wardell's motion to dismiss the sexual harassment lawsuit. There is some pure gold in all of this:

[First response on a forum](http://www.quartertothree.com/game-talk/showpost.php?p=3211297&amp;postcount=187)

&gt; ... She later emailed me telling me she was mad about the incident - to which I apologized for hurting her feeligs but also insisted that I watch what jokes I tell around the office. (To understand the context, **we're a relaxed software company, lots of Family guy jokes, Simpsons references, Robot Chicken references**, etc.)...

Family guy jokes: truly a spitting image of professionalism.

[But it don't stop](http://www.littletinyfrogs.com/article/430919/No_its_not_up_to_everyone_else_to_adapt_to_you):

&gt; **And just in case it wasn't obvious enough: No one has ever been ""sexually harassed"" here.** If someone is told jokes they deem inappropriate, they have every right to ask that they not be repeated. If someone kept telling that person similar jokes, that would be, imo, harassment and illegal. But it's NOT okay to demand that everyone else, when not in your presence, conform to whatever standards of behavior you think they should have.

Wait, hasn't he said that he's a vulgar sexist and all that?

[And he has a Twitter](https://twitter.com/draginol/status/243781762055024640) and he's not afraid to use it!

&gt; It should be pointed out that Stardock's lead developer is female, our COO is female, our marketing lead is female. 

*Feeeeeemales!*

Would you like to see what victim blaming looks like when it's in a summary dismissal?

&gt; [During work hours at Stardock, she worked on a website for a Mixed Martial Arts clothing company as a side job, which contained pictures of her scantily clad with comments about her ""hot ass"". **Plaintiff was thus a willing participant and contributor to the environment which she now portends to have found offensive**.](http://i.imgur.com/cM3CA.png)

[](/stare)

All those ""comments"" he's talking about? [There was one and it was from Facebook](http://i.imgur.com/Onw8M.jpg).

Maybe I'm just being too harsh on the guy! Oh...

&gt; Bring in for an interview with me:...Wendy Inhathong (She's pre-law, **very smart, not particularly pretty but very ambitious**)

Remember the purity test thing?

&gt; [I wasn't making it up.](http://i.imgur.com/kReCF.png)

Wait, I thought Brad Wardell said no sexual harassment happened at Stardock?

&gt; [Hence if I ""jokingly"" touched Alexandra's hair or teased her about her fiancee, I respect her request that this should cease. **However, my general obnoxiousness is not subject to change and I would terminate the corporation and all jobs within it if I felt my rights were being curtailed.**](http://i.imgur.com/zmy9s.jpg)

I saved the best for last though:

&gt; [Defendant responded by telling Plaintiff that **""if the government wants to take anything away from my company, that's when I shut it down. The way I see it I can walk around naked in my office and if I can't then I won't have one.""](http://i.imgur.com/znPUa.png)**

1348598380.0,190,self.ShitRedditSays,10golo,[Too Much Effort] A FEEEEMALE's dog dies due to negligence by an airline? Internet Rationalization Squad Reddit is here to see the real criminal is brought to justice.,278,88,101,http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/10golo/too_much_effort_a_feeeemales_dog_dies_due_to/,"http://www.reddit.com/r/offbeat/comments/10ftqw/united_airlines_killed_our_golden_retriever_bea/

The backstory: A woman was on her way back to San Francisco with her SO and their two dogs. She paid $1,800 for some Pet Care service that United Airlines offered, which she assumed included, I dunno, *keeping her dogs alive*. United Airlines thought it meant something else, so when she landed and attempted to pick up her two doggies, some baggage handler informed her one of them died en route. They then lied to her about her dog being taken to a vet for autopsy, when in actuality she was in a back room while a supervisor decided how to handle the situation.

Now reddit, having read this heart-wrenching story, decides the *real* criminal is the woman who would dare adopt a dog to show, would dare have a career as a model, and would dare be a woman in general.

Let's begin, shall we?

---

[Top comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/offbeat/comments/10ftqw/united_airlines_killed_our_golden_retriever_bea/c6d57p8) is an ex-baggage handler excusing the airlines because ""cargo holds on passenger planes are cramped, dark, loud, and not a fun place to be"" and ""We also didn't go out of our way to be wonderful and caring to the pet. Didn't have the time to."" Of course, they have time to charge her $1,800, right?

""But GVP,"" you may say, ""That's not that bad! Just normal Reddit Contrarianism®."" And you would be right— if it was the only comment.

&gt;[For $1800 they could probably hire someone to drive the dogs across country with minimal risk. If you truly love your pet that much, don't shove it in the cargo hold like one of your suitcases.](http://www.reddit.com/r/offbeat/comments/10ftqw/united_airlines_killed_our_golden_retriever_bea/c6d5fn4?context=3) [+208]

To paraphrase, we know the history of the term ""feminazi"" and how it's been used by anti-feminist right wingers to discredit the feminist movement. However, since the term was appropriated wrongly in the first place, we feel that it's not our place to try and reappropriate these terms or to make joking references to a genocide and an incredibly sensitive Jewish heritage. In the same vein, joking references to Hitler, even as a sarcastic counter to antags who wrongly use it to refer to SRSters, are inappropriate. We know people outside of SRS use these words and phrases in a disrespectful manner. We should not do the same for the sake of circlejerking.

Basically, all the top questions seem to be white-rights advocates complaining about perceived unfairness to whites, and forcing the poor girl to apologise for incidents of racism from black people, which has absolutely nothing to do with the topic.

Then there's this beauty defending the need for r/niggers because of ""oppression"" against racist people, and that it isn't really racist after all:

[Or maybe it's impossible to live a normal life while publicly holding the beliefs, so they have to be kept underground.
/r/niggers is meant to be a light-hearted/joke subreddit with connotations about racial differences. Hence the reason that there are giant cartoony watermelons and fried chicken in the top banner. If it was meant to be taken seriously it would have a serious presentation. To say /r/niggers is racist and should be banned (although I haven't seen you say that, but most people think this) would be the equivalent of saying Dave Chapelle should be banned from doing stand-up because he has ""racist"" material in his routine.](http://www.reddit.com/r/casualiama/comments/14dx4x/i_am_a_black_girl_that_just_briefly_read_through/c7ccslg) [+10]

Unlike the above guy who went straight up for unabashed casual racism, this guy at least tries to hide it by forcing her to explain why white people are being ""oppressed"" by affirmative action:

"" [How do you feel about affirmative action and quota hires?

&gt;You claimed you want to ""Raise awareness"" of racism, yet you clearly only want to show alleged racism where blacks are the perceived victims. Why don't you (or the media) talk about the Farm Murders in South Africa or Zimbabwe? Why don't you discuss how the blacks in those nations have gone from bad to worse now that Whitey is dispossessed? Why don't you discuss how much more black-on-White violence occurs in American than white-on-black?

Some more shit from the rest of the thread:

---

I was pretty excited to learn that /r/feminisms existed as an alternative to /r/feminism, where moderator /u/Demmian removes anything that conflicts with MRAs, and who has what at that time was the most ass-backward non-transparent moderation I had ever seen.

Unfortunately, /r/feminisms is very much exactly the same thing, except replace /u/Demmian with /u/yellowmix, and MRAs with TERFs - and remove *any* pretense at transparency whatsoever.

I'll start with the most recent incidents. Here are two threads recently posted in /r/feminisms:

http://www.reddit.com/r/feminisms/comments/1e96kr/the_transgender_candidate/

You see a lot of [deleted], but zero moderator posts giving any indication of what's happened. What you *don't* see is a whole bunch of other posts that didn't have responses to them. Here's a selection of removed posts (obviously mine are the only ones I have access to):

* [A detailed explanation of why the idea that acceptance of transgender people is positively correlated with homophobia and misogyny is horseshit.](http://i.imgur.com/paTR3On.png)

* /u/Granny_Weatherwax [asked whether veronalady had linked to her own blog, and noted she should seek help for her unhealthy obsession](http://i.imgur.com/FOlZwaw.png) (note: [she has acknowledged that it is](http://i.imgur.com/d7Q5Jof.png)), and I [linked another of her blog posts for reference](http://i.imgur.com/eRUGK3Z.png).

* Here, [two different lengthy posts have been removed](http://i.imgur.com/dvrgWbX.png). It certainly isn't okay to expect people to take responsibility for their hateful speech.

* Granny_Weatherwax linked [this image](http://i.imgur.com/id5R5.jpg). /u/girlsoftheinternet responded completely off-topic, complaining that Serano didn't ""make the case convincingly at all that trans women are female"". [Apparently noting that that doesn't have anything to do with anything isn't allowed.](http://i.imgur.com/r6Is2kO.png)

* [This is the comment chain I referred to above](http://i.imgur.com/pT2dKIi.png), noting that I was ""still waiting"". The ""So rebut it"" link goes to the first post above - the lengthy look at what was wrong with veronalady's ""isn't it interesting?"" BS (which hadn't been removed at the time, but is now).

BTW, for /u/Granny_Weatherwax's removed comments in that thread, you can dig back a couple of pages in her profile.

The second thread:

http://www.reddit.com/r/feminisms/comments/1e2mk6/who_owns_gender_trouble_and_strife/

* [Here are a bunch of removed comments.](http://i.imgur.com/gHn3G9H.png) The first several are mostly bickering - fair enough. But then again, we see lengthy discussion and argumentation removed - with the TERF posts left standing.

As an aside, funny story: yellowmix has decided that the term ""TERF"" (which stands for variations on ""trans-exclusionary radical feminist"", and is a hell of a lot nicer than other terms I've seen used, like ""badfem"", ""radscum"", or ""shithead"") isn't acceptable (because it ""attacks feminists"") and has threatened to ban people for using it. Meanwhile, calling trans women ""men"" is a-okay.

* [Here's a discussion of Julia Serano's ideas](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/feminisms/comments/1e2mk6/who_owns_gender_trouble_and_strife/c9z1s1i?context=3). Hey, it looks mostly intact! Cool. But wait, [what's that [deleted\] at the end](http://i.imgur.com/NUwtaKa.png)? Add ""questioning TERFs as to their actual, specific beliefs"" to the list of things that aren't allowed on /r/feminisms.

* Oh, but [telling people ""FUCK YOU""](http://i.imgur.com/r3AEuU2.png)? Nothing wrong there - at least, if you're a TERF talking to a trans woman.

Oooof course.

Moving on...

A few months back, in [a thread about Wordpress ostensibly shutting down Gendertrender](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/feminisms/comments/16w6st/if_you_care_about_the_censorship_of_women_read/), /u/girlsoftheinternet asks, in response to complaints about the cissexist shit being posted, ""should they ban us then?"". [Lengthy response answering that question in good faith? Removed.](http://i.imgur.com/gCLRtFX.png)

Note that this thread was tagged as ""BRIGADE WARNING"", despite pretty much everyone present being regular /r/feminisms users, and the thread not having been linked anywhere - on the basis, as far as I can tell, of a bunch of trans users arguing. That **must** mean there's some kind of brigade going on, right?! 

[I posted a thread about this](http://i.imgur.com/Vqn0Eii.png), but of course, predictably, it was censored. When I messaged their modmail, I was told by yellowmix (who is the only /r/feminisms moderator who has *ever* responded to *anything* - and I'm pretty sure until recently they were the *only* active moderator) that that was because they were ""planning to post a meta thread on the subject soon"". [They did post a survey](http://www.reddit.com/r/feminisms/comments/1722uf/community_feedback_session_the_inaugural/) that seems likely to have been on this subject (evidently I missed it when it was going on - go figure), but no follow-up ever occurred, and there's no indication of what the results were, much less of anything ever coming of it. 

[Here's an incredibly nasty post about how trans women aren't *real* women.](http://www.reddit.com/r/feminisms/comments/15od3l/natalie_reed_4th_wave_transfeminism/c7ra64g) Gosh - I wonder what all that ""[deleted]"" is?

(**Brief aside**: it's not acceptable to ""criticize feminists"" in any way. Okay, sure! But these people are *identifying themselves as ""trans-critical feminists""* - they are actively criticizing trans people, trans people who are feminists, and trans feminism as a perspective.

There are more examples, to be sure, but I've since lost them.

**This is an ongoing problem with /r/feminisms.** It claims to be ""inclusive"", but while it's totally allowed for people to shit all over trans women (while pretending trans men don't exist, of course), it's *not* okay to argue back.

In the absence of literally any response or feedback explaining why post after post, comment after comment, has been deleted, all I can see is that the moderators (or more likely just yellowmix, who again seems for a long time to have been the *only* moderator who had been active on reddit in months, before bringing on a few new people only recently) are protecting their TERF buddies and silencing people who disagree with them.",,False,,t5_2s4m9,False,,flair,True,t3_1eirp6,http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/1eirp6/guest_effortpost_rfeminisms_moderators/,

The original post discusses discrimination ugly women face by men, so, naturally, the men pile in to tell women how it's totally just as hard for them and men can be ugly too! So far, so Reddit. 

However, what surprised me in this thread was the sheer number of people telling women off for daring to talk about their problems in the main womens' subreddit - and, since the number of comments on the post were still fairly small, I decided to do a bit of counting. 

This is as of 12:22PM GMT, when the thread is 8 hours old. I also discounted a subthread where a woman specifically asked for men's opinions. (So bear in mind *there was already a specific area of the thread set aside for men to talk about themselves*) 

Overall number of comments: 79

Number of separate commenters just there to tell women that men totes have it bad too: 17 

Number of top-level comments agreeing with the sentiment of the post: 15

Number of top-level comments about the poor men: 8

Number of top-level comments agreeing that don't have long strings of deraily arguments in the subsequent comments: 5

So, to sum up: If someone posts anything related to a womens' issue that might also affect men in the womens' subreddit and you comment on it with anything vaguely supportive, you have a 2/3rds chance of being corrected for daring not to include the poor men in your comment. If you don't post and just scroll through the comments, a third of them will be there to remind you once again about the poor men, in case you forgot for entire seconds that it's also a problem which affects them.",,False,,t5_2s4m9,False,,,True,t3_16qysq,http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/16qysq/tiny_effort_women_attempt_to_discuss_experiences/,

Goddamn, I could write a whole post about that shitty thing.

Great sentiment right?

Top comment,

[I'm legitimately confused, how does 'PARTY WITH SLUTS' imply there's a lack of consent going on?](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/zi0wc/many_of_the_guys_in_my_school_have_party_with/c64rhce) +310

I kind of thought that was obvious. Frat boys who where shirts like these prey on women who are very drunk, or try to feed women alcohol. Men like this who wear shirts saying ""party with sluts"" probably aren't too worried about getting consent and more concerned about ""getting laid"", which is how women who attend these parties get so taken advantage of. They are calling these women SLUTS to further degrade them and use them for their own pleasure

___

[""Party with Consent"" sounds contrived and doesn't convey a positive message. Maybe if the original was ""Party with rape"" the shirt would make sense.](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/zi0wc/many_of_the_guys_in_my_school_have_party_with/c64t66d) +25

[If OP is in college I don't see what's inappropriate about the shirts. (PARTY WITH SLUTS) If high school, than yeah probably inappropriate.](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/zi0wc/many_of_the_guys_in_my_school_have_party_with/c64s0wx) +13

___

I am surprised that so many in this thread are defending the use of the word ""slut"" in this context. The men are saying slut to degrade women and reduce them to nothing more than their own sex object

[What if all the guys bought the shirts to support all the Slut Walks that were happening?](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/zi0wc/many_of_the_guys_in_my_school_have_party_with/c64tgvz)

These men aren't calling these women sluts because they believe these women are sexually indepedent and empowered...Using the word slut back to refer to these women BACK in the SAME way these men are is just reinforcing their misogyny 

[the shirts are clearly showing a positive feeling towards sluts, if anything they're saying 'party with girls who like giving consent' which should please everyone, including the sluts.](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/zi0wc/many_of_the_guys_in_my_school_have_party_with/c64soqi)

WHEN YOU SEE A MAN WEARING A SHIRT THAT SAYS ""PARTY WITH SLUTS"" I THINK IT IS SAFE TO ASSUME HE MORE THAN LIKELY DOES NOT RESPECT WOMEN AND IS WEARING THE SHIRT BECAUSE HE IS A HUGE MISOGYNIST

If you missed the statement, that's probably because the only website you look at is reddit. While the direct link to the speech was submitted hundreds of times to various different subreddits, a grand total of zero made it to the front page. [Only one submission received over 10 karma, with a lot more submissions in the deep negatives.](http://www.reddit.com/search?q=obama&amp;sort=new)

What did make it to the front page was reddit's vewy vewy med reaction.

**Numero Uno Med Post**

In Advice Animals, you'll find this super thoughtful submission titled [""Scumbag Obama on Surveillance""](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/1io8kg/scumbag_obama_on_surveillance/) with an upvote total of +748! Good work guys!

In it, the author lays out their thesis that Obama should care more about NSA spying if he doesn't like direct and personal racism. Obama, this affects white people now. You should care more about the white people.

**Numero Dos Med Bro**

This one comes from the grand halls of /r/conspiracy, so you know its going to be nuanced and thoughtful. It's titled [""Obama's Sweeping Trayvon Statement SUCCESSFULLY Distracted The Media \(&amp; Masses\) From Today's NSA Re-Authorization!""](http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1io0sf/obamas_sweeping_trayvon_statement_successfully/) with a score of +1294.

I don't even want to look at those comments bc I'm sure the NSA will upload a virus INTO MY BRAIN.

**Numero Tres Med Host**

Our third, and sadly final front page post about Obama's statements come from /r/cringpics. Yes, Obama's statement on how he's directly been affected by racism was so terrible to white reddit that it makes them cringe.

It's titled [""Obama just posted this on his official Facebook page, this is just getting ridiculous now...""](http://www.reddit.com/r/cringepics/comments/1iofhl/obama_just_posted_this_on_his_official_facebook/) with an upvote total of +394. It's a direct quote from his statement in which Obama sympathized with Trayvon, saying he could have been the victim 35 years ago. I just cringed so hard at reddit the skin peeled back from my skull.

This isn't everything, really, just a few of the ones that made me laugh. The bulk of the deletions were victim-blaming (""but she mentioned her anus! Open season!""), so I haven't included them.

It used to be that I'd only delete comments on Skepchick that were really, truly out of bounds. If someone said something idiotic but polite, I'd let it through. That's changed now due to the sheer number of idiotic comments in moderation. I let a few through here and there and the Skepchick commenters tear them to shreds, but if I let them all through, the idiots would dominate the conversation and that's the antithesis of the community we have built on the site. It would be r/atheism, I guess, where a few intelligent people valiantly battle against a flood of morons and a [post in which I argue for compassion](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/nt5x6/a_response_to_reddit_makes_me_hate_atheists/c3bub46) is currently at -3.


So yeah, if you're wondering why these didn't make it onto the site, the answer is: basic moral and intellectual standards.

OK! First let's dispense with the usual uncreative shit:

[""get back in the kitchen, bitch""](http://i.imgur.com/veHt5.png)

[""GO SUCK A COWS DICK YOU FEMINIST WHORE""](http://i.imgur.com/DGBq0.png) (That one was because I 'started swearing.' It's true, I did use the word 'shitty'.)

[""Back to the kitchen with you, Twatson""](http://i.imgur.com/rS5h3.png) crt56a via Reddit message

[eatadickdyke@whineycunt.com](http://i.imgur.com/hUsjT.png) via Skepchick message

And there's always [at least one guy](http://i.imgur.com/N9ozv.png) who tries to get me ""fired"" from the podcast I co-host.

OK, on to the other deleted comments:

[Comments don't count until they have at least 30,000 upvotes.](http://i.imgur.com/wFHX6.png) Also, individuals within a group giving to charity means that individuals within that group can do whatever they want!

&gt;Just to make sure I’m clear on this, you’ve shown posts with about 1,000 upvotes (most of which have at least half as many corresponding downvotes) in a subreddit with over 300,000 subscribers, and that’s what you want to tar the entire community with?
&gt;0.30% of the community are what make you hate reddit?
&gt;Are you aware that the number of atheist redditors who donated actual cash to ‘Doctors without Borders’ during the atheism donation drive far exceeds the 1,000 upvoters on the (admittedly disgraceful) comments above?

[What's the difference between the photo of the girl holding up a book and the three photos of guys holding books?](http://i.imgur.com/doHKe.png)
&gt;There’s a clear difference: she’s smiling whereas the guys are not, some are even out of focus. It’s likely that some men would also show up their faces, my anecdotal evidence is that it’s common to find pics of women showing their faces but not among men, perhaps men are more concerned about criticism against their looks or their vanity, so they’re more prone to repress themselves, or perhaps my memory is biased because I’m a man.

[Remember when all those boys were chased out of the community by an avalanche of rape jokes, misandry, and sexual come-ons?](http://i.imgur.com/7IrIE.png)

&gt;What I find telling is that you wouldn’t give a shit if this were occurring to a boy.
&gt;I’m not defending their behavior in anyway, but that’s because I don’t like double standards regardless of what side I find myself on.

[I auto-delete any comment that refers to human males as ""men"" and human females as ""females""](http://i.imgur.com/oary5.png)
&gt;Obviously females have been (and still are) prejudiced against more than men, but that’s a little ridiculous. Men, too, can be put in difficult situations due to their gender. If you don’t think so I’ll just leave these here… more to come if you really think men shouldn’t be allowed to have a voice when they feel they’ve been wronged for whatever reason (ie divorce cases)
&gt;http://reason.com/blog/2011/11/28/gag-order-silences-parents-of-boy-charge
&gt;And you should read about “Joe Paterno”. I imagine you all would be up in arms if a sex offender was given was a slap on the wrist and fired from his job, hhmm?

[A special message from Wow.you.whiney.bitch@******.us](http://i.imgur.com/V7mkW.png):
&gt;grow a thicker skin

[This makes me feel way better.](http://i.imgur.com/VPyBI.png)
&gt;Most of the people on there…are in no way actually thinking of raping kidnapping or doing anything horrible to that girl.

[Don't shoot down potential allies for equality. Love, *****femnazi@*****.com](http://i.imgur.com/LSKoR.png)

[Victim-blaming done right](http://i.imgur.com/VaAdQ.png)
&gt;…And 15 year olds don't like to jokes [sic] about sex? I don't see what you're getting at there.

[A few examples of baffled Redditors who don't understand the 1st amendment](http://i.imgur.com/r5fsB.png):

&gt;I find it extremely telling that you did not approve either of my comments in which I tell you that you overreacted

[Why did you women bring up the sex of the poster? WHY DID YOU DO THAT??](http://i.imgur.com/xQuU2.png)

&gt;Are you seeking special treatment because you have breasts? I don't expect to have any type of treatment a all being a male on the internet. I never bring my sex up at all, besides in threads like these.

[""Why are you targeting us when you should be aiming your disgust at Muslim men?""](http://i.imgur.com/OpUQD.png)

&gt;Do you know that they rape girls for going to school?

There are more coming in by the minute, but I'll end there so I can do something else with my day. Thanks again to /srs for making me laugh at the things I would otherwise just rage at.

No, really. Usually when I write these things Redditors have found some “new” and “exotic” type of person to marvel at and be crude towards, but this time it’s just lesbians. And the fact that these women in general, and the woman who OP posted about in particular, *exist* is too much for Reddit to handle. 

Before we get into the particulars; some context. [The thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/18isml/my_lesbian_friend_for_the_win/) in question revolves around a /r/funny submission of a [letter](http://i.imgur.com/GkVMvrZ.jpg) written by a lesbian to some stranger who was whispering about her orientation in her apartment’s laundry room. At the time of this posting it had been in the /r/all top 50, and had received around 1060 net karma with 410 comments.

As always, we’ll look at what was said first and then try to make sense of it afterwards. Fair warning: a lot of this stuff is probably triggering and all of it is gross. Not everything I’ve included is highly upvoted, but is instead indicative of the prevailing attitudes in the thread. Everything linked here had a positive vote total at the time I wrote this.

 With all of that out of the way, let’s shun our fiat currency and dive in.

So what did we learn? Well, the way I see it the three categories I’ve outlined are not only the three salient ‘jerks going on here, but are also textbook bigotry: 

First, Reddit just does not understand that the things that they say can hurt others. They don’t get that it’s incredibly uncomfortable for a stranger to show up and comment on your sexuality, gender, or race (along with many other axes!) because you have no idea what their intention is. They don’t get that being a minority can be scary. They seem to forget that *within their own lifetimes* violence against gender and sexual minorities has not only been condoned, but encouraged. They assume that the default experience is that of a straight, white cis man and that anyone who has a different perspective on situations that do not threaten SAWCSMs is overreacting.

Second, if you’re a minority and you stick your head up, Reddit cannot wait to cut it off. Just look at the types of insults that are being thrown around here. Reddit criticizes her by going after her gender and her orientation. This isn’t even them justifying the use of slurs as “linguistic drift” or “reclamation”, it’s straight up using slurs to put someone in their place. Compare and contrast with ‘jerk number one.  

Third, Redditors love binaries. They love the idea of men and women, they love the idea of normalcy and deviance, and they love the idea of good types of minorities and bad types of minorities. This is literally the same ‘jerk as “I don’t hate black people, I hate n*****s”. I don’t hate gays, I hate f**s. And unlike the “every white man is a special snowflake who deserves to be judged on their individual merits (which are so clearly superior- doh’ho’ho)” ‘jerk, every single member of every single minority is a representative of everyone in their minority and all minorities. Reddit, your compassion for GSMs is a mile wide and an inch deep. You love Jane Q. Taxpayer if she keeps her queerness to herself, but as soon as she’s someone whom you actually have to deal with you can’t wait to throw her under the bus.

And all this together has the cumulative impact of establishing straight men as gatekeepers of the rights, privileges, and inclusion that are incumbent to the liberal utopia that Redditors seem to believe that they have created. Ironically, I think that [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/18isml/my_lesbian_friend_for_the_win/c8fa7l0) comment sums it up the best. If the oppressed aren’t up to your standards, if they make you feel uncomfortable, or weird, or are mean to you, then fuck ‘em. They get no rights. They get no privileges. They get no inclusion. It’s literally an acknowledgement that you hold all the cards, all the power, in that situation. It is definitionally privilege.


In closing, not as a representative of all gender and sexual minorities, but as one myself: Fuck you, Reddit. Fuck you and your ally flair and your hatred of the Catholic Church and the Boy Scouts. We don’t need or want your lukewarm, self-important alliance. We don’t want your permission to be who we are and we don’t give a shit about your acceptance. Either you support inclusion of *all* GSMs or you don’t support the inclusion of *any* of us.

Featured is aerospace engineer, pilot, astronaut, and all-around bad ass [Marsha Ivins](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marsha_Ivins).

Some of the comments in [the thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/gifs/comments/16zwaj/meanwhile_in_space/) are actually pretty cool, including a 7th grader giving a fairly decent explanation for why hitting your head in space would still hurt.

However, despite all of the accomplishments of this woman, she is still a woman, and thus in reddit's eyes she is not a person to hold in esteem, but rather an object.

I already linked to this comment in the previous submission, but I just want to rant about it a bit more: 

&gt;[If you wanted to pinpoint the most primitive culture on the entire planet, that of Papua New Guinea would be the strongest contender for the top spot.](http://np.reddit.com/r/news/comments/1csqvy/a_us_academic_has_been_gangraped_by_an_armed_mob/c9jmyxi) 

&gt;[This is a place that still practices cannibalism, believes wholeheartedly in magic and thinks indoor plumbing is the work of the devil.](http://np.reddit.com/r/news/comments/1csqvy/a_us_academic_has_been_gangraped_by_an_armed_mob/c9jmyxi)  [+83|-13]

What the fuck.  Okay, firstly cannibalism is quite rare in PNG these days.  Also, in my opinion at least, there is nothing inherently immoral about cannibalism.  Murder is certainly wrong, but not all cannibalism practised in PNG was due to headhunting, and even when it was, cannibalism wasn't the reason for the tribal warfare.  I've even heard anecdotally that when one PNG tribe was visited by an anthropologist just after World War II and was explaining the events to them, they were shocked at how immoral the Western world was that they would kill people and then just *waste* the bodies!  Secondly superstitious belief is only ""magic"" when non-white people have it.  Haitians, Africans and Papuans believe in magic.  White people believe in god (wow, I'm so brave!), lucky numbers, miracles and astrology.

MOST IMPORTANTLY, Papua New Guinea is the most culturally diverse country on Earth.  It has over 800 cultural/ethnic groups which can be EXTREMELY different from one other.  Treating them as a homogenous entity is completely racist and ridiculous.  Also, what the fuck is ""cultural evolution?"" and how is it not obvious that calling one culture  ""primitive"" compared to another is completely subjective?

Reddit is always happy to soliloquise about how different the cultures of the different American states are, or the countries in Europe.  But when it comes to the most culturally diverse country on Earth (coincidentally full of POC), ""meh it's all one culture"".  

When one commenter calls them out:

&gt;[Are you seriously making a connection between 'primitive' cultures/practices and rape?](http://np.reddit.com/r/news/comments/1csqvy/a_us_academic_has_been_gangraped_by_an_armed_mob/c9job9b) [+21|-27]

another Redditor responds:

&gt;[That would be wrong why?](http://np.reddit.com/r/news/comments/1csqvy/a_us_academic_has_been_gangraped_by_an_armed_mob/c9jouso) [+30|-9]

A [brilliant, clearly informed, comment](http://np.reddit.com/r/news/comments/1csqvy/a_us_academic_has_been_gangraped_by_an_armed_mob/c9joaua) explaining the problem with the OP's reasoning, but is downvoted by Reddit because it's not STEMy or racist enough presumably [+45|-49]

Then there's this shitstain of a comment:

&gt;[Papua has little law, still has cannibals, people wear only penis sheathes and feathers in the highlands, and rape is so culturally acceptable they have a huge festival (called the yam festival) in parts where any man wandering around is fair game for forced sex.  So, what do you expect?](http://np.reddit.com/r/news/comments/1csqvy/a_us_academic_has_been_gangraped_by_an_armed_mob/c9jmwum) [+22|-10]

Again, mention of the actually fairly infrequent cannibalism. So primitive!11.  Apparently they should wear the exact same clothes as white people, even though it's really fucking hot and humid in PNG. I mean, did you know they don't even wear fedoras?!?!

Then mention of the yam festival, which somehow manages to include casual racism with ""WHAT ABOUT THE MENZ?"" while being completely wrong.  Firstly, this mass female-on-male rape is attributed to the [Kilivila of the Trobriand Islands](http://thedogster3.wordpress.com/extra/).  These people are no more culturally, linguistically or ethnically similar to New Guinea Highlanders than the average redditor is.  Also, it's probably completely apocryphal.  I know because I read about this supposed behaviour in the course of writing my thesis on [Papuan Tip languages](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papuan_Tip_languages), of which Kilivila is one and I personally asked [the world's biggest expert on Trobriand Islanders](http://www.mpi.nl/people/senft-gunter), who said he'd never witnessed it over the 30 or so years he'd been travelling there.

Note, as of my posting this, almost no sympathy for the poor woman who got sexually assaulted.  For Redditors, this article just represents yet another chance to go on a racist circlejerk.  I'm going to go lie down and weep now :(

A Wisconsin school district runs a few programs emphasizing diversity and racial issues. One of these programs, Volunteers in Service to America, has a list of suggestions for students who wish to become more aware of racial issues, one of which includes wearing a wristband which reads ""White Privilege"" as a reminder to be more conscious of privilege on a day-to-day basis. Not as a matter of policy or a mandatory policy even for students who are trying to be conscious of these things, but just a suggestion, peripherally linked to one program the school supports.

So naturally it was posted to /r/libertarian and [blown out of proportion in the most transparent move from covert to overt racism many of that sub's users have ever made](http://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/1a55ey/wisconsin_education_officials_want_students_to/). The second highest-rated parent comment in the thread:

&gt; If anyone is getting fucked in America today, it's white people. The table is tilted, and whites have to put in more effort to get the same returns as minorities. College grants anyone... how many minority grants are there? Literally giving kids money because their skin is a certain color. White kids don't get that shit. **It's not the fault of white kids that minority children are more likely to have worthless piece of shit parents**. Political correctness is ruining this country. [Emphasis added] [+24]

What does any of this have to do with free markets and minimal government? Not much! But apparently I was wrong to give these people the benefit of a doubt just because my libertarian friends IRL support a safety net, and are conscious of privilege and the effects of governmental policies (the drug war, ""tough on crime"" legislation, racial profiling, foreign policy) on disadvantaged groups worldwide and in the United States in particular. No - /r/libertarian has gone straight-up Stormfront. The comments in this thread are more than just being young and ignorant and believing that you live in a ""just world"" where everybody has an even shot and success is earned, and are seriously some of the nastiest stuff I've seen in recent memory. I can't laugh at this stuff yet but maybe some of you more seasoned veterans can:

&gt; This sort of thing is the face of true racism. I (as a white guy) am told that because I look similar to people who did bad things a hundred years ago, I need to feel guilty and beg forgiveness from people who do not look like me. [+16]

Yeah, an isolated example from one area of the country blown out of proportion by a right-wing website (and one which affects literally zero people negatively), is the ""face of true racism."" So is, apparently, made to feel vaguely guilty for a couple of minutes on one particular day. When will white people ever get a break from the constant abuse hurled their way? Suddenly becoming conscious of how subtle messages and depictions might affect people once they're of your race isn't suspicious at all.

But now we're back in the mire, and this one's terrible:

&gt; Examples of White Privilege:

&gt; Pronouncing words properly.

&gt; Literacy.

&gt; Growing up with two parents in the home.

&gt; Conscientious family decision to value education.

&gt; Teaching personal responsibility to children.

&gt; Cooking meals at home and eating properly (as opposed to buying cereal and gatorade at 7/11 with EBT).

&gt; Not robbing or stabbing people.

&gt; Do all whites engage in the culture of ""white privilege""? Absolutely not. Do most? For the most part, yes.

&gt; For those interested in the topic, check AmRen.com daily. America's white, affluent, intelligent, educated, heterosexual, responsible, and successful male is today's jew. [+12]

See, discrimination is justified because minorities are merely violent, ignorant degenerates! ""Privilege"" is just code for being born as a better ""kind"" of person! There's a word that starts with ""r"" and rhymes with ""mace schism"" that this guy would probably reject as a fair description of his comments!

There *are* some awesome people in that thread working to various levels of success to overturn the dominant narrative, and most of them are in the positives, indicating a sympathetic audience.

#### More Complicated Things

Privilege Denying Dude is a bit more complicated than the stuff we've been doing up until now.

    [*thing at the top* **thing at the bottom**](/privilege)

Note one asterisk each side for the top one, two each side for the bottom.

This gets you, e.g.

[*objectified?* **personally i would be flattered to be treated as a sex object**](/privilege)

Disingenuous Liberal works along the same principles:

    [*thing at the top* **thing at the bottom**](/liberal)

Goes to, e.g.

[*Sorry, I was totally being sexist when I said that* **But next time, could you be more polite when you call me out for it?**](/liberal)

Hueypriest smoking poo also works like this.

    [*thing at the top* **thing at the bottom**](/huey)


goes to e.g. 

[*my* **penis**](/huey)

&gt;Yes, it's widespread. Erin Pizzy received death threats, and her dog was murdered, by SRS-type feminists, because she dared to point out that women can be perpetrators of domestic violence.

Why is it that only Erin Pizzey and the MRAs claim she got death threats and was forced into exile? Am I missing something here? All I can find is Erin Pizzey saying she received death threats and MRAs parroting that. Also, lol at throwing SRS under the bus.

Someone posted a video of a woman yelling at MRAs. Erin's thoughts?

&gt;Number 1 – Is feminism a cult?
&gt;I have to say, for me feminism displays al the behaviours of a cult. Using the B.I.T.E. Model it controls Behaviour, Information, Thinking and Emotions. The whole issue of Undue Influence and people joining in because they believe it will make them appear a better person and also provide instant sisterliness and group membership, it's significant. If you do things the right way, you are a good feminist. If you don't, it allows the feminist cult members to detect you and cast you out. Ex-feminists also have the same pattern of recovery as cult members. It's spooky. Do you see feminism as a cult, and what are the most cult like elements of feminism, that you have encountered?

Um. I don't even know what to say to that. Erin thinks feminists are a culty bunch though.

&gt;I certainly think - and this is why I work for A Voice for Men - which is probably the most forward-thinking and the best platform for those of us who want to end the war, to support men and women. I almost think, rather like South Africa, and Apartheid, we can see traces of this in the Gender War.
&gt;
&gt;What we need to recognize is that actually the Gender War was declared by the feminists in the late 60s and 70s to create a billion dollar industry that would ringfence a huge amount of money i.e. a billion for VAWA alone, by excluding men.
&gt;
&gt;If I had to suggest, I might suggest something like Desmund Tutu and others' ""Truth and Reconciliation Commission"" after Apartheid to help men's and women's leaders come together.

Really? The ""Gender War"" that don't real is like apartheid? [The More You Know *](http://stream1.gifsoup.com/view/204031/the-more-you-know-o.gif)

&gt;Well he's more than welcome to try, but because actually what will happen is that a few women will come out of that world in those areas that suit men's brains better than women's, and do well, but most of them won't, and they'll just leave and go on to other professions or to have children or family. That's what's been happening all the time when they've had quotas.

[In a similar vein:](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/tijm2/my_students_are_your_future_6th_grade_paper_on/c4my1i8)

&gt;I teach some of these kids. It has nothing to do with their ""shortcomings."" Some of them are just lazy apathetic turds. I went into teaching very passionate, with that same ""Every student deserves an education"" mindset. However, some students do not want to learn. You cannot reach everyone. I agree that positive detailed feedback is a must, and I pride myself on it, but that last sentence is a world of fuck you just don't understand. The more time you spend focusing on the ones who absolutely refuse to learn, the less time you can spend on the ones who deserve to be the leaders of tomorrow. The student who wrote this put no effort into researching the material and could have just as easily been high while writing it. If this teacher writes ""You should be more specific with your information,"" do you think he would care?

This is also my first post and first effort post, though I've been lurking and occasionally commenting for a while.  

So some enterprising individual posted a picture of a middle school girl with your standard silly but ultimately harmless photo edits. I did a million of them when I was that age that thankfully no one reuploaded to another site to mock with later. [Link to post.](http://www.reddit.com/r/cringepics/comments/175y1x/classic_vidya/) The whole concept (and honestly most of /r/cringepics probably) is shitty enough as it is but it, oh wait, it gets worse. 

This middle school aged girl has facial hair?! She didn't fall from the sky with perfect eyebrows and without hair anywhere but her head? Let's delve into the comments. They are almost all 100% shit.

[Age](http://i.imgur.com/opp3T.png)

[Gender Identity](http://i.imgur.com/RaohT.png)

Again we have a majority of **men**, making up **57%**. That's still far, FAR less uneven than Reddit's 80%.

\* where ""other"" includes the choices genderqueer, nonbinary, and agender

Similar to the last survey, **85%** of SRSers are **cisgender**, and our trans\* elite ruling class comprises about 5%.

Cis | 88% | 85%
Trans\* | 5% | 5%

[Sexual Orientation](http://i.imgur.com/TZX6U.png)

There is a slight majority of **heterosexual people** at **56%**, followed by bisexual, gynesexual and pansexual people. This is pretty similar to the second survey's results.

| | | |
:--|:--|:--
&amp;nbsp; | Survey 2 | Survey 3

Gynesexual | 2% | 13%
Androsexual | 1% | 7%
Skoliosexual | 1% | 6%
Unsure/questioning | 4% | 6%

*n.b. for the 3rd survey, people could choose more than one box, hence the higher percentages generally.*

There was a similar set of results for [romantic orientation](http://i.imgur.com/GEQkz.png).

:--|:--|:--

Skolioromantic | 1% | 4%
Unsure/questioning | 7% | 7%

Same disclaimer for sexuality applies here.

By comparison, Reddit's 2011 survey says: 

 * Straight: 92%
 * Gay: 3%
 * Bi: 5%

(and yes there were only three choices, and no box to write in.)

[Location](http://i.imgur.com/NYn9G.png)

Once again, we can see that SRS is primarly North American, with a staggering **79%** of users currently residing there. That's fairly close to Reddit's own 80%, which is not very surprising.

##Disability

~~No graph for this one, due to Google Docs weirdness.~~ [Graphs provided by the brilliant SND2!](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/11c3f2/meta_the_long_wait_thurvey_threesults/c6lb4nh)

Counting the entries in the .csv shows that, out of 941 responses to this question, 852 identified as ablebodied/neurotypical. That's **90.5%**.

Do note, though, that I forgot to put ""neurotypical"" on until fairly late after the survey had opened, and I got several people saying that they weren't neurotypical but they were ablebodied and so picked the ""yes, ablebodied"" option. That number should be lower, but there is still a clear majority of ablebodied and neurotypical SRSters.

[Race](http://i.imgur.com/mKiJf.png)

Believe me, I am fully aware of how fucked-up the race question is on every survey, and let me say in advance that I'm sorry :C

The closest approximation we managed to come up with this time was to ask about white privilege. Using that metric, **85%** of the surveyors benefit from white privilege. I am also aware that I messed up the follow-up question, so take this number with a grain of salt. Nevertheless, it's probably safe to say that SRSters are mainly white, and PoCs are the minority.

[Religious views](http://i.imgur.com/DBwqL.png)

The majority of SRSters are athiest, with the next biggest segment being agnostic SRSters.

| | | |
:--|:--|:--
&amp;nbsp; | Survey 2 | Survey 3
Atheist | 68% | 59%
Theist | 8% | 7%
Agnostic | 32% | 33%
Spiritual/religious | 12% | 17%
Nonspiritual/nonreligious | 25% | 23%

[Reddit use](http://i.imgur.com/aun4R.png)

The graph's very nearly symmetrical, which is nice. There's a clear peak of users who have been on Reddit for over a year, but under two years, at 35%. That's slightly up from Survey 2's 31%, but the general shape of the graph stays the same.

[SRS History](http://i.imgur.com/slG98.png)

This time there are many more long-time SRSters, with 41% of those surveyed having signed up with the Fempire for 6 months - 1 year. By contrast, in survey 2, 23% of those surveyed had been with the Fempire for that same bracket, with the majority in the 3 months - 6 months category. Again, not surprising, given that Survey 2 is about 6 months old.

(As a side note: from about 10k subs to 24k in six months? Wow.)

[Finding SRS](http://i.imgur.com/qIUX6.png)

This is, personally, my favourite part of the entire survey. Why? Because, as you have probably guessed...

...those very same people who call us slurs and tell us to slink back to our feminazi lairs (*hssssss*) are responsible for the **majority of new recruits**.

That's right.

^I'm&amp;nbsp;not&amp;nbsp;counting&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;participants&amp;nbsp;who&amp;nbsp;entered&amp;nbsp;""unsure/can't&amp;nbsp;remember""&amp;nbsp;for&amp;nbsp;this&amp;nbsp;question.

| | | |
:--|:--|:--
&amp;nbsp; | Raw numbers | Percentage
Negative discussion | 320 | 44.2%
Positive discussion | 140 | 19.3%
Botnet | 113 | 15.6%
Another site | 122 | 16.9%
Random button | 29 | 4.01%
Total | 724 | --

Two things about this table:
1. This is pre-Project PANDA, so the numbers will probably be a little different.
2. Many of the old bots are now defunct.

[Favourite Aspects](http://i.imgur.com/la0Ex.png)

These are all pretty even, but the biggest draws seem to be **the community, learning opportunities, and strict mod policies** at 68%, 65% and 64% respectively. Who said feminazis aren't great?

(Not you, I hope, because then we'd have to drag you to the Fempire Re-education Station. ALL HAIL THE ARCHANGELLES!)

Scrolling through the ""other"" entries, many of the responses are along the lines of ""not being questioned"", and ""it makes Reddit so very mad"".

[Knighthood and Starbursts!](http://i.imgur.com/giB0y.png)

Although about a third of SRSters eschew the White Knighthood in favour of meeting shitlords with a glorious hail of dildzbullets as a scorntrooper, 21% of those surveyed are part of the Titanium White Knights. These brave folk dazzle shitlords everywhere, sending them scurrying back to their burrows while they gallantly ride in under the banner of Common Human Decency, with the traditional battlecry, ""Reddit Delenda Est!"" echoing in the air.

I'm sorry to say, though, that colourism is still a problem, with 33% clearly favouring pink Starbursts. Obviously, this is the result of some sort of oppression against other Starburst colours. I recommend we institute some sort of selective Starburst campaign to boost the opportunities of the Oppressed 11 - yellow and orange Starbursts.

[Femperial Service](http://i.imgur.com/7OASC.png)

The Misandry Militia is easily most popular, sitting at a comfy 29%. Ladies, you have to ramp up your recruiting campaigns - especially the Bennedzilla Battalions (7%) and the Downvote Brigadiers (8%). Honestly.

**SAWCSM REPORT, bought to you by the very amazing Pyrolytic!**

(For the purposes of this analysis, SAWCSM = Straight Ablebodied White-privilege-having Cisgendered Male)

Firstly, a SAWCSM percentage table. By 5/5, it means hitting all five categories; 4/5 means four categories, and so on.

:--|:--|:--
&amp;nbsp; | Raw numbers | Percentage
5/5 | 297 | 31.4%
4/5 | 312 | 33.2%
3/5 | 189 | 20.0%
2/5 | 104 | 11.0%
1/5 | 36 | 3.81%
0/5 | 8 | 0.85%

Next let's take a look at some of the most common non-SAWCSM letter combinations. The two most numerous, after SAWCsMs (297) were SAWCsW (Straight etc. Women, 122) and OAWCsM (not heterosexual, ablebodied white etc., 122). Right under that was OAWCsW (not heterosexual AWCs Women, 111). Those three together make up a cool 37.5% of those surveyed.

So, essentially, the vast, VAST majority of SRSters experience oppression on at least one axis. There's a higher percentage of SAWCSMs in this survey, compared to survey 2 (29%), which is probably a reflection of the larger subscriber numbers. If you're drawing from Redditors, you're going to get people who reflect Reddit's demographic trends.

###IN CONCLUSION:

WE'RE STILL AWESOME FUCK YEAH

Also, the easiest way to spot a troll is to give them a blank text box. Because, of all those hundreds of responses in the ""describe the Fempire"" box... there is a hell of a lot of love for the Fempire, a lot of relief and happiness and also amazing misanderandical anger.

SRS is...

    Radical, militant, satirical, postmodern, funny, clever. Mostly it's just a relief that I'm not the only one.

...in a nutshell.

1359659175.0,161,self.ShitRedditSays,17n7fu,[EFFORT] India tells Redditors that women deserve respect. Redditors respectfully disagree. ,245,84,66,http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/17n7fu/effort_india_tells_redditors_that_women_deserve/,"Earlier today, progressive and family-friendly subreddit /r/pics posted [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/17m4ky/the_times_of_india_is_running_14_page_ads_on_why/) image from an Indian newspaper. It basically says that if you're a man who treats women poorly, you're half a man. Such misandry cannot go unpunished! Luckily, the friendly MRAs of Reddit are on the case!

--------

&gt; Just so everyone knows, the Times of India is actually a really shitty paper that is known for sensationalism and siding with politicians based on 'bought' articles. While running this 1/4th page ad is a good thing, it is very much so a marketing gimmeck... 

Remember folks: rape is a product!

&gt; ... India is so hopped up on the issue of rape right now that everyone is speaking against it just to get some the attention and favour of the general public. [\[+129\]](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/17m4ky/the_times_of_india_is_running_14_page_ads_on_why/c86uizo)

All of this marketing hooplah just serves to distract from the REAL problem here -- that more people are aware of and speaking out against rape.

Most people, without questioning, just buy into that popular notion that women deserve respect. But fear not: redditors are not so dense! /u/earllemongrab1 is here to level the playing field!

&gt; What is the definition of womanhood?

&gt; Is it a flat belly, curled hair, and thin arms?

&gt; Is it umpteen hours spent on the treadmill?

&gt; Is it rash driving and drunken parties?

&gt; The definition of womanhood is not

&gt; the size of your bra

&gt; But the space between your ears.

&gt; How you think is how womanly you are.

&gt; The true test of your womanhood is

&gt; how you treat a man.

&gt; All men. Any man. Every man.

&gt; If you do not respect a man

&gt; you are only half a woman. [\[+11\]](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/17m4ky/the_times_of_india_is_running_14_page_ads_on_why/c86xdqw)

A nice rewritten version of the poem that forces Reddit's female readers to check their damn privilege! Thankfully, the MRAs are here to ensure that when the issue of womens' rights comes up, nobody steps on the steel-toes of reddit's endangered population of heterosexual, cisgender men. 

But nahhhh. It is a fun and insightful rewrite of the OP's poem, but doesn't fully address our issue. It's time that we *really* get intellectual about this!

&gt; It is 50% right.
There is no value in respecting women then acting like an arse to other men. Women do not deserve special recognition, they deserve equal recognition.
The real message is for humans to love other humans. I appreciate the circumstances surrounding this ad but it does kind of demonize men and victimize women in its tone of delivery. [\[+33\]](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/17m4ky/the_times_of_india_is_running_14_page_ads_on_why/c86v2wc)

It's important to know that disrespectful people don't deserve respect -- *especially* women. We also must be careful, in our deep and stimulating discussions about womens' rights, to not unfairly demonize men. Sure, statistics show that they're responsible for [99% of all rapes committed in the United States](http://www.oneinfourusa.org/statistics.php), but eh. Statistics are misandric by nature, anyway.

So instead of compiling a list of who exactly reddit hates, I think it'd be interesting to see who reddit **doesn't** hate. I'll search the thread for a few keywords, let's see if reddit has something against its own demographic; I'll filter out results that are irrelevant (e.g. ""American"" used as an adjective and not to indicate prejudice against Americans):

[1606] ,280,122,130,http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/10zuvw/effort_title_emma_watson_says_shes_down_for_nude/,"Hear hear, people! Reddit's collective penis goes mad at the thought of a nude Emma Watson! But what is that, you say, there is a downside? *NON!* Oh the cruelty when this desire is conflicted by the prospect of it being an adaptation of the famous book '50 Shades of Grey'.


Some comments:

“I wanna see her buthole”

&gt; “See, at first I got excited for this...but then realized she's going to be lathered in makeup, maybe even some CGI work...and will be tits only and it will be okay. I'd much rather see her in a filthy sex tape filmed with an HD flip cam or something...jesus christ.”
[+298 and +9 points](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/10z09f/emma_watson_says_shes_down_for_nude_scenes_as/c6hvo11)

“gentleman, prepare your boners” [+25](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/10z09f/emma_watson_says_shes_down_for_nude_scenes_as/c6hvbry)

“fapping to the article” [+27](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/10z09f/emma_watson_says_shes_down_for_nude_scenes_as/c6hvws3)

“50 Faps a Day.” [+25](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/10z09f/emma_watson_says_shes_down_for_nude_scenes_as/c6hy257)

“Erecto patronus!” [+362](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/10z09f/emma_watson_says_shes_down_for_nude_scenes_as/c6hv38y)


But that is not all you see, some MENZ just respect Emma too much for them to accept that she might want to go nude for a movie!

“I couldn't respect her after such a role.
EDIT: That's one hell of a controversial post.” [+14](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/10z09f/emma_watson_says_shes_down_for_nude_scenes_as/c6hxzo0)

“I have too much respect for Emma Watson for her to do such a lousy sex scene. It would be hot no doubt, but no! I will refuse to be bought by twilight fanfiction, nice try! Someone find her something that isn't as shitty as 50 Shades of Grey to go into because that could kill her career like Twilight has done to Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart” [+421](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/10z09f/emma_watson_says_shes_down_for_nude_scenes_as/c6hvcyh)

“The thing that makes Emma Watson so sexy is the fact that she doesn't wear a bunch of slutty clothing. She dresses fairly modest and lets you use your imagination.” [+2](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/10z09f/emma_watson_says_shes_down_for_nude_scenes_as/c6hxx8q)

Long whiny white person nonsense including:

&gt;I lived for years in the Middle East and couldn't believe how overt the racism was. There was this hierarchy where certain peoples were at the top and others, like Asians, were considered dirt. [+122]

You may notice that that has absolutely nothing to do with the OP's question. Anyhow, a reply:

Yep white people who don't watch certain types of porn because they're racist are the real victims of racism. (edit: To clarify, I meant because the white people are racist, not because the porn is racist. Porn being racist rarely stops white people from watching it.)

Also, u/rapist666 fears for white-European culture:

&gt;[So making a European nation into a non-European nation is supposed to be an improvement? What is made better by taking away its identity, culture, and heritage?](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/18x5a2/why_are_white_communities_the_only_ones_that_need/c8isumg) [+12]

Miraculously, they did, and their answer isn't that bad at least relative to the rest of the comment section, and even comes close to being insightful in spots:

&gt;My thought about it is that white people don't want to integrate with minority communities, but would rather have the minority communities integrate with their ways of living. We have laws and scholarships that cater directly to minorities so that they can join our standards of living.  

&gt;For example: If there was a group of 10 people and a group of 3 people, and you were in the group of 10 people, would you rather have the people in the smaller group join your group, or would you rather leave your larger group to join the smaller one?  

&gt;[In both cases you're increasing diversity, but in different ways. However this example doesn't include cultural differences, wealth differences, or a history of racism and segregation between the separate groups.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/18x5a2/why_are_white_communities_the_only_ones_that_need/c8irq9v)

-----

And another top level comment that doesn't even attempt to answer the OP's question:

&gt;[Minorities are racist.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/18x5a2/why_are_white_communities_the_only_ones_that_need/c8irqx9) [+19]

In truth, power has cycled between Asia, North Africa and Europe pretty consistently since the establishment of Sumeria some 4,500 years ago. ... There were times when Europeans did rule a decent amount, but our modern concept of the Imperialistic white man is only about 500 years old. This is in no way meant to be a complete representation of world history. I'm just a little upset any time the whole ""White people ruled everything"" mantra is brought out, because history is a constant flow of power, mostly resting around the Mediterranean and the Middle East *where there are no white people ever*.""](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/1gmoog/world_history_in_one_sentence/calsaq6)

TIL because white people dominated and decimated entire continents for the past 500 years, and our history books are pretty much only written from the perspectives of white people, a little meme like this is totally harmful to the entire white race. God bless white people. Special enough to maintain a hegemonic grip on racial supremacy, but innocent enough that we can brush off their history as ""a flash in the dark.""

&gt;Same course, professor, refused to acknowledge any progress in race relations in our country over the last 100 years. Reason, doing so would demotivate the current generation from fighting harder. This was UPenn, an Ivy league school.

There's a single comment after that about a man with similar clothing whose dog is doing a similar thing, that's cool. Aaaaand then we're back to classic reddit, as fohr takes their cue from the top comment and even improving upon it:

He claimed to someone named Robert Parker that his owner, free black colonist Anthony Johnson, had held him past his term. Parker told Johnson that if he did not release Casor, Parker would testify in court to this fact; under local laws, this might cause the forfeiture of some of Johnson's land. Under duress, Johnson freed Casor, who entered into seven years' servitude with Parker. Johnson, who felt he had been cheated, sued Parker to repossess Casor. A Northampton County court ruled for Johnson, declaring that Parker illegally was detaining Casor from his rightful master who legally held him ""for the duration of his life"".

WALL OF TEXT/INCOHERENT ANALOGY/LOCKSNKEYSYA'LL:

&gt;[I wish I could find it again but there was a post somewhere that described the current feminist movement. It likened it to society being a shopping cart with a bad wheel. So as you pushed the cart along, it kept veering off to the right/left (direction, not political). Feminism was the force that was used to get it to stop veering off so much. It helped compensate for the broken wheel.
But over time, the wheel had begun to work normally again. But feminism is still there, trying to compensate for a broken wheel that isn't broken anymore. Still applying the same force.
Basically, it's been quietly determined by many that since apparently men still rule the world, then obviously men have all the advantages. And any perceived inequalities on the part of men are deserved for the years of oppression and inequality for women in the past.
I'm no longer a sub of MR, mostly because of the QQ that goes on there instead of people trying to actually solve a problem. But there are SO many valid issues that MR brings up. Just remember that bringing them up around anyone who isn't of the mindset of an egalitarian will probably being some level of hate down on you.

The opening of the post:

&gt;Some of you may be aware of the Guy Gamerzzz steam group, well over the past few days it was reported and disabled by a feminist and her army of drones.

&gt;The group in question was close to 7000 members and in no way conducted sexism or harassment.

&gt;Why should this large community be shut down when there are dozens of female groups, with more prejudice undertones go free?

&gt;1. Some guy trolls her in tf2
&gt;2. She rants about him being an ass on her blog
&gt;3. **People in the group encourage each other to go to her blog and harass her**

Excerpt from submission:

&gt;My sister found upskirt pictures of herself on a family friend's son's phone. She is 17 and he is 15. I understand that they are both minors but I am seriously disturbed by this thought. The guy has been harassing her lately for sex as he is 'desperate to lose his virginity' and keeps sending her texts to pester her. They have never been romantically involved and he is merely a family friend.

&gt;She has spoken to me and my dad about this. My dad seems to think that she should not confront him as this would ruin the relationship with their family and could ruin this kid's life. He also said that it's her fault because she wore a short skirt that day. (I am so angry at my dad for saying this) I personally completely disagree with not confronting him, I think that some sort of action should be taken - whether this is confrontation or legal action.

Naturally, predditors look at this guy as one of their own.

SRS has close to 25,000 subscribers, and one of the rules is to not touch the poop.  People active on SRS are one of the main populations that would be downvoting shitty things on Reddit if SRS didn't exist, so if we (well just you unbanned folks now) aren't downvoting, then it makes shitty posts more upvoted than they ""should"" be.  I'm off to go downvote some bigotry now, it's been great chatting with you all.

A Voice for Men continues to list this woman's details. They run a doxxing site called Register-Her. I won't link AVfM of course, but you can find it in the posts above, if you can stomach the place.

If your answer was none, you were mostly right.",246,96,130,http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/19iwhw/effort_ever_wondered_what_wise_words_of_wisdom/,"[The original post](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/19gm2y/is_this_wrong/) is a Confession Bear meme that reads: [""My friend has been suffering from anorexia for almost a month. I think she's starting to look hot""](http://i.imgur.com/IxianhW.jpg)

Wow. I don't even know what to say about that. Let's turn to the comment section to see what Reddit can come up with.

&gt;[""nothing wrong with that. Some people find the super skinny look attractive.""](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/19gm2y/is_this_wrong/c8ntvtm)[+16]

So there's nothing wrong with encouraging eating disorders. How else are girls going to meet Redditors' incredibly high standards?

Then of course we have the people who are really looking out for the friend's interests. Oh wait, no they're not. They just think the OP should help because he might get laid. Great.

&gt;""Yes it's wrong, if she's anorexic, as a friend you should be helping her. Not thinking 'I'd tap that'""

&gt;[""Why not both?""](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/19gm2y/is_this_wrong/c8nudk5?context=1)[+50]

But wait, there's more.

&gt;[""Because you help her deal with the disorder she has... And then you tap her because you're that good friend that helped and needs to be rewarded.""](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/19gm2y/is_this_wrong/c8nx4gc)[+15]

And more.

&gt;[""Maybe, just maybe, you'll get something out of it. But chances are that you probably won't.""](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/19gm2y/is_this_wrong/c8nvmex)[+22]

And then, because really trivializing eating disorders isn't enough, we get to a discussion of a Reddit classic: the friend zone.

&gt;[""Or he'll get friend zoned because that's actually how the world works.""](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/19gm2y/is_this_wrong/c8ny1m5)[+23]

For comparison the person saying that the friend zone doesn't exist get's downvoted.

&gt;[""Being nice and a good friend is the bare minimum anyone has to do to be attractive. The friend zone doesn't exist.""](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/19gm2y/is_this_wrong/c8o0zi2)[-14]

In other less upvoted but still despicable news we have the person who doubts the girl actually has an eating disorder.

&gt;[Someone can start getting thin and not eating and it's called ""suffering from anorexia"" within 30 days? Did she say,""Hey guys, I've got anorexia.""? And is she walking all lanky with curled hands and sucked in cheeks? Serious question.. A month?""](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/19gm2y/is_this_wrong/c8nxo0k)[+14]

The person who thinks only skinny people can have eating disorders.

&gt;[""Slightly unrelated, but I once saw a girl who was fairly overweight overtly claim to be anorexic as she bit into her slice of pizza. She definitely suffered from a myriad of other problems, but anorexia was not one of them.""](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/19gm2y/is_this_wrong/c8oahom)[+2]

And the person who has a purely academic interest in the subject.

&gt;[""How hot are we talking. I think we need pics, for science.""](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/19gm2y/is_this_wrong/c8o1a74)[+5]

For the record, there are also a lot of people in there sharing a lot of support and information for people with eating disorders, so I'm not completely hopeless about the future of humanity.

We shouldnt be saying that, well people have been racist for a long time, so to counter that we are going to treat these people special and give them extra things that other races can't have. You can either not stand for people saying homosexuals aren't equal, or you can treat them specially and give them extra things that a heterosexual person cannot have.

It descends into chaotic arguing from there. Luckily, a number of posters called people out on their shittyness. Unfortunately, more shitlords came to argue back. Everyone is downvoting and upvoting everyone else and canceling shit out. Apparently, it is rage arrow clicking FTW. 

Finally, I’d like to point out that all typos and grammatical errors belong to the posters. My autocorrect actually helped them out quite a bit.

Hello everyone. 

Let's start out with saying that cheating is not a nice thing to do. If someone confesses to cheating on their spouses, we might even politely tell them that we disapprove of such behavior. 

However, there are worse crimes *(like, say, blackmailing)* and there are mitigating circumstances. *(like being abused by your spouse).*

So naturally, when [a woman asks for help on these issues](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/11o13j/im_30f_fearful_of_nude_photos_being_leaked_to_my/), people express sympathy and give her advice on how to deal with a husband that used to be abusive, and how to seek protection from the person blackmailing her.

JUST KIDDING. THIS IS REDDIT AFTER ALL.

To summarize: woman has her self-esteem destroyed by abusive husband. Seeks some comfort by chatting with a man who treats her nicely. Sends him naked pictures. She wants to end the thing. Man is now blackmailing her, threatening to send the pics to her workplace and husband.

**So obviously, everyone on /r/relationships needs to tell this woman looking for help what a terrible person she is and how everything is her fault.**

- [Top comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/11o13j/im_30f_fearful_of_nude_photos_being_leaked_to_my/c6o44s4) says she was cheating. How dare she not show nudes to her husband btw??? And how dare she threaten the HUSBANDS job by being blackmailed. It seems clear that he's the real victim. Expresses contempt by saying he would absolutely divorce someone like her. (+128)

- [This lovely comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/11o13j/im_30f_fearful_of_nude_photos_being_leaked_to_my/c6o671x) is brave enough to call the woman a liar right away. She claims to be abused? Clearly a ""cop out"". She just wants to ""gain sympathy"". Continues to scold the woman for giving into the pressure of blackmail. ""You contacted him? Seriously?""  Calls a victim of abuse and blackmail **Childish and cowardly**. Keeps going on about the husbands rights and what HE deserves to know. (+58)


Okay, so far no one really condemned the person blackmailing. Minimal decency in [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/11o13j/im_30f_fearful_of_nude_photos_being_leaked_to_my/c6o5ozw) post at least acknowledging that the guy is doing something illegal. Instead we have hundreds of upvotes for people railing on the victim. What's next?


- [Here we go](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/11o13j/im_30f_fearful_of_nude_photos_being_leaked_to_my/c6o58vw). In an abusive relationship and just looking for someone to treat you with decency? YOU are the bad person, YOU get to be spelled in all caps and YOU ""get what you deserve"", and apparently that's blackmail (+76)


Rarely has there ever been such a lack of empathy in one place. So far, no one wasted a thought about how distressed the woman might be over this, being threatened to have her nudes leaked at her workplace.


- I can't even make fun of [this one](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/11o13j/im_30f_fearful_of_nude_photos_being_leaked_to_my/c6o654b). Verbatim: ""You cheated on your husband, but then you even were unfair to the guy you cheated with because you just cut him off with no explanation.""

- [This one also gloats over her misfortune](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/11o13j/im_30f_fearful_of_nude_photos_being_leaked_to_my/c6o4kvo) saying ""Karma is a motherfucker"" and again blaming her for not sharing naked pictures with her abusive husband, but with someone else. Apparently when you marry someone, you not only owe them your body but also pictures of it. (+43)

- ""[woman up](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/11o13j/im_30f_fearful_of_nude_photos_being_leaked_to_my/c6o4kvo)"" (+10)

- You are [dishonest and selfish](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/11o13j/im_30f_fearful_of_nude_photos_being_leaked_to_my/c6o67ir) you silly victim. (+19)

- My own comment is still [in there](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/11o13j/im_30f_fearful_of_nude_photos_being_leaked_to_my/c6o8vvg) but apparently wanting to help the woman to be stopped being blackmailed is [morally bankrupt](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/11o13j/im_30f_fearful_of_nude_photos_being_leaked_to_my/c6o996m) and direct quote, ""[being black mailed now does not absolve her from both emotional and physical adultery.](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/11o13j/im_30f_fearful_of_nude_photos_being_leaked_to_my/c6o9kdc)"" (+5).

We had a staggering **1138** responses in the few days it was open, and over half of them (some 700+ responses) came in on the first day alone.

[The old survey results](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/nzipz/meta_srs_survey_results/), if you want to compare.

*~Special Notice: The [SAWCSM Report](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/s5v68/meta_srs_survey_20_results/c4boqmg) is now available.~*

&amp;nbsp;

**[Age](http://i.imgur.com/Re0uH.png)**

Quite similar to the last time, the vast majority of our users are in the **18-29** age group, which makes up 80% of our userbase. Within that group, slightly more SRSers are in the 18-22 group than in the 23 - 29 group (41% vs. 39%).

&amp;nbsp;

**[Gender Identity](http://i.imgur.com/GPfm2.png)**

Once again the results show a majority of SRSers are men, with **59% identifying as men** and **32% identifying as women**. 2% identify as nonbinary, 3% as genderqueer, 2% as unsure or questioning, and 1% as no gender.

For the purposes of comparison (click for source; I've looked for the 2XC survey but can't find it again):

| | | | | 
:--|:--|:--|:--
&amp;nbsp; | r/SRS | [Reddit](http://blog.reddit.com/2011/09/who-in-world-is-reddit-results-are-in.html) | r/2XC
Male | 59% | 80.7% | 15%
Female | 32% | 18.7% | 80%
Other \* | 8% | - | 5%
No response | - | 0.614% | -
Number of responses | 1131 | 32 754 | 852

\*I included all of the other 4 options in the SRS survey and the ""Transwoman/Transman"" (these are the options taken directly from the 2XC survey) answers for the 2XC survey, because the options don't quite match up.

A further **88%** of our users **identify as cisgender**, while **5% identify as transgender**, and another 5% unsure or questioning. This 5% is obviously our entire ruling class. All hail the trans\* elite!

&amp;nbsp;

**[Sexual-Asexual Spectrum](http://i.imgur.com/93lhV.png), [Sexual](http://i.imgur.com/pDqX0.png) &amp; [Romantic](http://i.imgur.com/Ngmie.png) Orientation**

Not surprisingly, the majority of SRSers **identify as sexual (81%)**, with 9% identifying as gray- or demisexual, 3% as asexual, and 5% as unsure or questioning. 

That links in very closely with the results for sexual and romantic orientation. As expected, 3% identified as asexual for sexual orientation. The majority of SRSers are **heterosexual (56%)**, followed by bisexual (12%), pansexual (9%) and homosexual (8%). Romantic orientation is also broadly similar, with **55% identifying as heteroromantic**, followed by panromantic (11%), biromantic (8%), and homoromantic (7%).

Overall, though, we've a pretty diverse spread.

(Sidenote: heteroromantic is a funny word. I think it's the ""roro"" in the middle. Heh.)

&amp;nbsp;



**[Race and Place of Residence](http://i.imgur.com/j6Vk5.png)**

NOTE: Yes I know the question is super problematic; if you've got ideas for improvements, don't hesitate to mention them in the comments. The difficulty came in creating a question on race that didn't overlap with ethnicity, that could be applied internationally, not just in America. (And don't even get started on ethnicity...)

14% of SRSers do not identify as white, so it's probably safe to say that the overwhelming **majority of SRSers are white**, or are at least generally perceived as white. **73%** of our users come from **North America**, with 17% from Europe and 5% from Oceania - not that surprising, given that this is an English-speaking site.

&amp;nbsp;

**[Education](http://i.imgur.com/6badM.png), [Religious Views](http://i.imgur.com/8Ww1W.png) and [Employment](http://i.imgur.com/FGA4U.png)**

The majority of SRSers have had **some college, but no degree (38%)**. Given the results for age, this is probably what we'd expect. 31% of SRSers surveyed have a bachelor degree, and 12% have a graduate degree.

**68% of those surveyed identify as atheists**, 32% as agnostic, and 8% as theists, so there goes the ""SRS is a fundamentalist Christian centre!"" accusation.

**51% of those surveyed are students**, which again is in line with the results for education and age. 43% are currently employed. 

&amp;nbsp;



**[Reddit use](http://i.imgur.com/O7ATO.png) and [SRS History](http://i.imgur.com/BpEa2.png)**

These graphs look like a bell curve, but sideways... anyway! Most of the survey takers have used Reddit for **1 to 2 years**. As for SRS usage, the majority have used SRS for **3 to 6 months**. Most of the survey takers have used SRS for quite some time; only 7% have been on SRS for under a month.

&amp;nbsp;

**[Finding SRS](http://i.imgur.com/yHOZE.png)**

Most of our users got here from **non-SRS subreddits ~~complaining~~ talking about us (24%)**. The next highest draw is our hard-working bot network, with 18% of survey takers saying that they found out about SRS through their efforts. Thanks, bots!

&amp;nbsp;

**[Favourite aspects of SRS](http://i.imgur.com/HWcNF.png)**

These were all pretty equal, though as it turns out a slight majority like SRS for its **educational aspects**, and the **discussions from minority perspectives** (63% and 67%, respectively). This is very interesting, particularly as SRS's stated goal is to act as a massive circlejerk (52%, by the way.) 30 people were scrupulously honest, and admitted to trolling SRS. As for the ""other"" responses, many of them were along the lines of ""venting at shitlords"" or ""being taken seriously and not being dismissed out of hand"".

&amp;nbsp;

**Interest in [Activism, feminist issues](http://i.imgur.com/fg4lD.png), [GSM issues, racial issues](http://i.imgur.com/vVZ5j.png), [class issues and environmental issues](http://i.imgur.com/4Uco0.png)**

Broadly speaking, SRSers tend to **care very strongly about feminist, racial, GSM and class issues.** As these issues tend to be a focus in this sub, it's hardly surprising. We're not quite so concerned about the environment. For the most part SRSers are willing to engage in activism offline, with 56% of users choosing a 4 or a 5. 

&amp;nbsp;

**[Favourite Fempire subs](http://i.imgur.com/KOYR9.png)**

There were so many options, it broke Google Docs. The graph won't load at all.

SRS's favourite non-r/SRS Fempire sub is **r/SRSDiscussion at 73%**, followed by r/SRSMeta (47%), r/SRSBusiness(41%), r/SRSGaming (33%) and r/daww (32%). This makes sense, since the majority of survey takers indicated that they liked the discussion aspects of SRS most. Interestingly enough, talking with SRSers in IRC and the mods of SRSD will give you a *very* different impression...

(I'm a bit surprised that r/daww didn't get as many votes. Everyone loves r/daww. EVERYONE.)

&amp;nbsp;

**[Patriarchy Smashing and DAGS OR CATZ?!](http://i.imgur.com/zJXul.png)**

Clearly, the most important questions have been saved for last.

I am pleased to report that 95% of survey takers fully agree with smashing the patriarchy and/or the intersecting matrix of oppression, as they well should. FORWARD THE GYNOCRACY!

We also seem to have more cat lovers than dag lovers - but even more than that, we have 40% of our users breaking free of the dog/cat paradigm into a post-pet-binary lifestyle.

&amp;nbsp;



The parting remarks were interesting. Its purpose was to act as a troll detector, but literally hundreds of survey takers (well, 514 of them) instead used it to drop a message. I can attest to personally reading every one of them. No, I didn't have much to do.

They were incredibly heartwarming.

Really! So many of them were messages of support, thanking the Archangelles for making a non-shitty space on Reddit, or for making them less shitlordy, or introducing different issues to them. Loads of people wrote - well, *essays* - about how SRS genuinely helped change them for the better. Mad propz to the person who wrote us a sonnet, which I shall now copy-paste verbatim (if you don't want it up, o anonymous poet, PM me and I will take it down ASAP):

    a glorious apparition is before me,
    standing proud beneath a stormy sky,
    i behold the most righteous gynocracy,
    with my so unworthy eye

    beneath these skies lie a thousand redditors,
    slain by our lady's splendiforous saints,
    those stern and strict editors,
    with their legions in war paints!

    but the battle-hardened grow weary,
    and our hands tremble with this weight,
    of a task that would leave us teary,
    and so we see our storm abate.

    despite this it remains our true desire,
    to see reddit as capable of something higher.

There were also some messages to tone down the moderation or the circlejerking, but they were definitely in the minority.

&amp;nbsp;

So what have we learned from the survey take two? That we're mostly comprised of men, mostly cisgender, slightly-over-half heterosexual heteroromantics, pretty damn white, fairly young, mainly atheist, educated people, which considering that we're on Reddit, isn't at all a shock. But what's even more important is that all of these people are  presumably *not shitlords*. Reddit, take note.

[/r/cringe posts a link to how cringe-worthy an episode of ""To Catch a Predator"" is. The video depicts a 19-year-old man who talked in great depth about how much of a ""turn on"" it is that a girl is not yet 14 (shown in the chat logs), and shows him getting caught visiting the house of said 13-year-old girl for sex.](http://www.reddit.com/r/cringe/comments/14pqm9/to_catch_a_predators_most_cringeworthy_video/)

Now, you would think that the *reason* that this video is so ""cringe-worthy"" would be the fact that a grown man is trying to have sex with a 13-year-old girl... right? *Right?*

Before we get started, a little disclaimer: please understand that this effortpost is NOT set out to demonize casual sex.

Here is why: **this is not about the morality of casual sex at all, it is the [*arguably misogynistic tactics*](http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/oacfr/is_pick_up_artistry_of_the_type_we_see_in/) used to ""get"" sex.** It is very possible to have mutually satisfying casual sex with a partner that you look at as a full human being with their own important thoughts and emotions, separate from yourself and the encounter, who does not cease to be after you have [""f-closed""](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=F-close) them. You do not have to want a relationship with a woman to treat her like a human being. One of my main objections to PUA is that it treats women way [too much like video games or table top RPGs](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/hjvs8/my_secret_that_has_been_perfect_55_in_getting/c1vyxs5) to be played and then discarded.

Sedditors (/r/seduction) [contend](http://www.reddit.com/r/OkCupid/comments/p6rqd/iama_guy_who_has_had_great_success_on_okcupid/c3nb3t2) that the focus of PUA is on [inner](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=inner%20game) [game](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/gjqim/the_definitive_seddit_inner_game_collection/). I think that we can all agree that improving your self-esteem and becoming more confident is a clear net good.

Outer game techniques - which go beyond [simple flirtation](http://www.sirc.org/publik/flirt.html) are often taught in a series of manual-like steps that read like the directions to the worksheets you used to do in third grade. Some PUA also focus on some aspects of [neuro-linguistic programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuro-linguistic_programming) (called NLP) in the form of [patterns](http://www.pualingo.com/pua-definitions/pattern/) that

&gt; are combined to create a hypnotic autosuggestion in the target, which can later be recalled to solicit a desired response.

The freakiest of these [patterns](http://www.fastseduction.com/guide/03_Approaching/11_The_Patterns/) is [The Door Pattern](http://www.fastseduction.com/guide/03_Approaching/11_The_Patterns/p_door.shtml).

&gt;&gt; **Yes, but we don't try to shut down your subs.**

Wooooooooooooooooooooow.

Oh yeah, that little bit in bold got +9 upvotes.

The post pointing out that the MRA just associated /r/beatingwomen with /r/MensRights? It got downvoted :\

By the way, the subreddit in question is /r/Feminism. The thread was actually invaded by /r/MensRights and the best part of it all? [The highest voted post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Feminism/comments/108klq/i_dont_know_if_this_can_actually_make_a/c6bbqgs) is from the person who initially posted it to /r/MensRights in the first place. And what did he say to get ~127 points?

&gt; I didn't know /r/Feminism was pro-censorship. Nice to know, I guess.

&gt; You know what, the more I think about it, maybe I should become pro-censorship as well. I demand /r/Feminism to be removed! I find it deeply offensive and it protomotes violence against men!

&gt; ...

&gt; Sarcasm and kidding aside, calling for the ban of anything is very dangerous. Especially when vague words such as ""Aggressive Misogyny"" are used. Aggressive Misogyny? Do you people have any idea how broadly that can be applied and interpreted? If this petition is successful, who would be next? If /r/SocialConservative begins to advocate for America to embrace traditional gender roles for women, would that be considered ""Aggressive Misogyny""? I'm sure a lot of people on /r/Feminism would agree. /r/SocialConserative, now banned. Thanks /r/Feminism and Change.org!

&gt; And for crying outloud! Are you people really going to advocate Reddit to ban /r/Christianity because they are against sex change operations? I'm sure that can be considered ""Transphobia"". /r/Christianity, now banned. Thanks /r/Feminism and Change.org!

&gt; Everyone who up voted this, and who signed that petition, should be ashamed of themselves.

Right.

There's so much more to post from that shit-heap of a thread, but honestly, you all should just check it out on your own. Consider it some independent study into the minds of white male supremacists, their hatred for women and feminists, and their inability to understand what freedom of speech actually entails.

&gt;Getting too much pleasure out of pissing others off, no matter how fucking shitty those others are, is never good and seems like an easy way to fuck up a good mission. 

This always has been our mission. I very much enjoy pissing off reddit. It's my hobby. When I'm bored, I tell reddit to go fuck itself and call them the KKK. Bc they are. Or do people not remember the Stormfront OR Reddit posts? Or know about the 100's of neo nazi's that use reddit as a recruiting station?


If you honestly believe that SRS has a goal to ""fix"" reddit, save urself the time and unsubscribe. If anything, I want to watch reddit crash and burn.

Reddit user /u/Psycochem posted a [thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/qt7qd/got_the_job_of_my_life_so_i_chopped_off_my_hair/) recently in /r/pics. Here is the picture he posted:

[Oooh!](http://i.imgur.com/JwIA0.jpg)

In the thread he explains that he decided to chop off his locks after acquiring the job of his dreams. Presumably, one might think posting this to reddit is some sort of cathartic release. Perhaps he's looking for encouragement, or a ""hey well done man!"" sort of response. And of course, that's entirely all right. We are all of us human. We like to feel wanted, accepted, and a part of things.

So let's see how redditors reacted to this dude's pictures.

[](/dobb) [Another joke](http://i.imgur.com/djJxd.png)

Whilst these comments are all gently ribbing the guy for his appearance in the before panel, they are all seemingly good-natured (for redditors, at least). Everyone seems to agree that the guy has made the right decision.

It wasn't all sweetness. Just like the other thread in which a girl had a haircut, this guy had his detractors. Thankfully they were all downvoted and people called them out for being mean. Like this next one:

My wife died today of an unexpected complication from a longtime illness. She was a social worker (though she had been too disabled to work for a while) and a deep believer in social justice and if I ever said anything worth saying against hatred and bigotry there's a good chance it was because of her.

She wasn't a redditor, but if she had been she'd be here busting heads with the best of them.

I don't know you guys that well but I really appreciate you and I just wanted to say we lost one of the good guys today, and I lost much more. 

I have been letting people we know online know what happened, and I wanted to stop by here and say something and just say there's somebody you guys all would have loved that we lost today.  And I appreciate you guys being there because you've all got part of what was wonderful about her.

So thank you.

This is probably kinda incoherent and I apologize if so.

However, I'm an over[under?]-achiever and for that reason, I'm going to do y'all one better[worse?]. Read on. 

It all started one fateful morning on the fourteenth day of September, 2012 when yours truly was up extremely early and had nothing better to do but skip around reddit. Then he/she came across [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/zuuel/fuck_its_happening_im_sitting_here_and_its/), wherein a seemingly able-bodied redditor is using the disabled stall, then witnesses a wheelchair user waiting outside. The redditor takes a picture and posts it on r/pics.

Now ignoring the obvious shittiness of the fact that the redditor decided to take a picture of the phenomenon of disabled people using the restroom instead of just, you know, finishing the fuck up and getting off the pot, it didn't seem all that bad. 

But seeing as this is Reddit and the community are discussing disabled people, it was only a matter of time before trouble found itself here. 

----

&gt; [""So I totally understand that disabled people require extra room to maneuver in a bathroom stall, but why does that mean they should never have to wait?

Because it's really an ""off chance"" that disabled people need to use the restroom and it's also unrealistic for them to expect the stalls *built for them* to be vacant. 

&gt; [""yep. it's handicap-accessible, not handicap-only."" (+100)](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/zuuel/fuck_its_happening_im_sitting_here_and_its/c67zxmt)

Just like those parking spaces, right? The only difference is that you get a ticket for those. 

&gt; ... sometimes they [the disabled] just can't wait.""

&gt;&gt; [""That actually happens to non-disabled people, too."" (+20)](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/zuuel/fuck_its_happening_im_sitting_here_and_its/c681hmu)

Because your situation is totally the same as someone who may be paralyzed from the waist down. 

And now for our grand finale (because I need to get to class and I am starting to become nauseous)...

&gt; [""No fuck you if you think I got to use the tiny stall because my legs work. Unless it is at the Special Olympics you can take any fucking stall you want, and they can wait like anyone else would have to. That stall isn't reserved for crips, sure you can be first in line to use it because you need it.""

My theory is that within about 3 months Reddit will be completely indistinguishable from 4chan in its comments.  I mean this has already happened with subs like /r/spacedicks, /r/imgoingtohellforthis and of course /r/4chan.  There are likely others as well, but you get the gist.

Lately, though, I've been noticing 4chan-isms coming out into some of the default subs.  This is probably also to be expected as the 4chan kids get tired of just smearing their version of fecal matter only over their own sections of the site.  With a lax moderation policy they see what they can get away with and so they push the boundaries.  The first ones of the defaults to go will likely be /r/WTF, /r/funny and potentially /r/videos.  I imagine the last to fall will be /r/askscience, but I imagine in the face of the looming wave of adolescents hopped up on Mt. Dew and Cool Ranch Doritos even they will fall leaving the fempire as the last bastion of decency.

So, anyways, to back this theory up I'm going to do effort posts when I see them to try and document the decline.  If anyone else sees similar and wants to contribute their own reports please do so and just use the next sequential episode number and link back to the previous episode(s).  So, without further ado, the evidence.

**The thread**:  [""I'm just going to take a piss on the drive-throu, order my food, leave and pretend you didn't see me.""](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/y2x63/im_just_going_to_take_a_piss_on_the_drivethrou/) from /r/WTF 

**The 4chan memes:**

*1. [OP is Faggot](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/y2x63/im_just_going_to_take_a_piss_on_the_drivethrou/c5rwey7)* [[+53 (81/28)]](http://i.imgur.com/RCJap.png)

So this is one I've elsewhere and is pretty standard as far as 4chan goes.  I imagine earlier in the cycle this would likely have been downvoted, but by this point it's become pretty normalized.

*2. N*****s gonna nig [Example 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/y2x63/im_just_going_to_take_a_piss_on_the_drivethrou/c5rwff0)* [[-8 (12/20]](http://i.imgur.com/rudqD.png) and *[Example 2](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/y2x63/im_just_going_to_take_a_piss_on_the_drivethrou/c5rw6ve)* [[-4 (34/38)]](http://i.imgur.com/ZE9WZ.png)

So both of these are negative: why am I including them?  Well, they're the baseline reading for this meme.  I have the hypothesis that over time it is going to change and these posts will actually start being upvoted as the 4chan-nature takes a deeper root.  You can already see that in example 2 is has 34 upvotes and a couple of the replies indicate it started its life with positive upvotes before getting voted down.  Example 1 actually has one reply which suggests toning the language down, but keeping the sentiment the same, in order to appeal to a wider Reddit audience.

*3. Blatant racism.  [Example](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/y2x63/im_just_going_to_take_a_piss_on_the_drivethrou/c5rw2zl?context=2)* [[13(34/21)]](http://i.imgur.com/c1ZJW.png)

I wasn't sure what exactly to call this one.  I mean blatant, open racism has been part of Reddit culture for a while now, but I think most Redditors believe themselves to be ""above"" that.  They don't use racist language... unless, of course, it's in a totes hilarious joke.  Further down the page of the original thread there were a number of posts that were simply people saying N*****.  At this point they were, again, mostly downvoted, but I expect that will change over time.

---

So I know this one is light in content, but it's just the first field report.  Hopefully more will come in over time and they'll really start fleshing this idea out.  Maybe the moderation staff here will see what's going on and put their foot down, but I find that highly doubtful especially given the near-fetish levels of free speech love Reddit has.

A woman is messaged on facebook for over 6 months by a guy that she doesn't want to talk to. Naturally she posts it to reddit to complain about how overly attached and weird this dude is bc redditors love the Overly Attached Girlfriend meme.

&gt;Instead of ignoring the hate and focusing on the problems within the community themselves, they are, in essence, engendering it in the community they are trying to lift up and creating a forum to advance the idea that self-reliance is unacceptable and hate is something to accept as truth.

That's why /r/relationships exists to serve as a high quality venue for advice! Does your boyfriend spend too much time on his cellphone? Does your girlfriend have a totally annoying male best friend who, like, is totes orbiting and kinos her all the time? Have you forgotten how to get a lawyer, delete your Facebook, or need advice on choosing the right gym for you? Everyone at /r/relationship are experts in relationship and marital counseling and they can help you, hooray! [What should you do if your roommate got an e-mail that your boyfriend maybe raped somebody?](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/q1noh/boyfriend_accused_of_rape/) 

Wait. Whoa. 

That's kind of a fucked up question to ask the Internet. Let's see what they say! 

[Bitches be crazy, but more importantly, it'd be better for you to know what happened (or perhaps didn't happen) to make her start this kind of rumor. Rape, or even the accusation of it, is enough to ruin someone's life; it's not something to be thrown around lightly. Either some motivation exists to have provoked her into it, or she's really that crazy. Either way, it's important that you know.](http://i.imgur.com/ydN2g.png) - +33

[When I was in college one my friends was accused of rape. I know for a fact that the accuser was full of shit and was doing it for attention because my friend was with me the entire time this fictitious rape happened. An alarming amount of women think it's fine to make up these fake rape stories for sympathy/attention, it is not. My friend confronted the accuser after she spread all the rumors and recanted the rape claim.](http://i.imgur.com/KeBPm.png) - +15

[yeah, it really saddens me how common it is for women to make up rape stories. There are an alarmingly high number of women who have actually been raped/molested and no one believes them, it's disgusting. I am so thankful that as a woman I have never had to go through that.](http://i.imgur.com/KeBPm.png) - +7

[Okay. Stop it. I replied to you earlier, and I'm doing so again now because I don't think this is fair of you at all. What indication do you have to believe this? You have dozens of comments urging you not to; common sense of most everyone in this thread is saying this entire thing is bullshit. You said yourself that your boyfriend has been good to you for years...and you are still believing this is possible. If you were my girlfriend, and I'd been falsely accused of rape, I would feel so betrayed by you and your actions.](http://i.imgur.com/OjF2F.png) - +7

[From what you told us, I would believe him, especially if he's never given you reason not to trust him. While I understand a lot of that stuff goes unreported, I also believe if you are going to destroy someone's reputation and life that way, you better be willing to step up and report it to the police. That has not happened here, so I am inclined to call BS.](http://i.imgur.com/KeBPm.png) - +2

This is downvoted, but GODDAMN: [I agree. My current bf was accused of ""raping"" the same girl repeatedly. However, she was the one telling him a month earlier that ANOTHER guy had been ""raping"" her for over a summer. After they fucked for a few months, she told the OTHER guy (that she accused of rape) that my now bf had raped HER. The other guy believed her and came over ready to fight. It's probably just some stupid cunt trying to get revenge the only way she knows how- cry rape.](http://i.imgur.com/yqEyi.png) - -2. MAZEL TOV ON YOUR HIGH QUALITY RELATIONSHIP!

[](/edgypost)

____

/r/relationships solved that conundrum for me. I am satsified that ""bitches"" are ""crazy"" and that any woman who was actually raped would go directly to the police station and report her rape before passing go or collecting $200! With all of my shitty personal beliefs confirmed, I believe we now can take an /r/relationships intermission. Intermission will last approximately 2 days. Snacks will be served in the lobby.

______________________

A lot can happen in 2 days, I guess. [Turns out, he did it! He confessed to doing it!](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/q46q2/update_boyfriend_actually_did_rape_someone/) Most people in the thread are like, OOPSIE POOPSIE! But a few winners decide to hold out. People change! He was afraid to tell her the truth because she would judge him unfairly! She shouldn't be mad! How dare she attempt to get a restraining order? What about his inalienable gun rights? GOD, /r/relationships, WHY ARE YOU SUCH A HYPOCRITE? WHERE ARE YOUR IDEALS AND PRINCIPLES?

[But somethings just shouldn't be discussed in relationships. I don't tell girlfriends that I was sexually abused, homeless, involved in a gang, etc. It's just not relevant anymore now. Your boyfriend is trying to leave that behind and start fresh and you are punishing him for an act over five years ago. I don't think that was fair at all. He didn't ever hurt you and it seems clear he's developed since. Perhaps I just empathize with the dark past concept.](http://i.imgur.com/8K8hh.png) - +4. He's *developed* since then? 

[He hasn't done anything to her yet or made any threats. She has no grounds for a restraining order. When you get a restraining order against someone it also removes some of their civil rights (such as the right to own a gun) so you can't put a restraining order on someone without cause. The rape thing is all hearsay and won't fly in court.](http://i.imgur.com/mWykO.png) - +7 Oh yeah, I am TOTES WORRIED about this guy being denied a gun...OH WAIT. [](/ronpaul)

[Devil's advocate: Maybe he didn't want to say anything because he's ashamed of his past. He wants to forgot that dark time and forget it ever happened. He didn't want to worry the girl.I thought r/Relationships mantra was to not let the past affect the current relationship, but I see the hypocrisy is glaring. Although it some cases it can be warranted.](http://i.imgur.com/mWykO.png) - +7

This pile of shit then went on to complain all over the place, asking for a bridge.

###THERE ARE FEMINISTS AFOOT, ASSEMBLE SHITBRIGADE

And they did. And still are!

Once you let reddit know that there's feminists around, they're all over that. ""I'M GOING TO DEBATE YOU WITH FREESPEECHFREESPEECHFRESPPEECH"" And then they take yer internet points. And I was saving up for a bike. 

Anywho, the threads on atheism and skeptic are fucking hilarious. Here's my favorite quotes:

&gt;You do recognize that ""social justice"" in the presence and acceptance of discrimination against men, even if it is true that men face less discrimination than women, is not social justice of any kind, right? You can't have social justice and support the systematic silencing of an entire gender group...well, you can but it makes the term social justice completely meaningless.

The Shitbird herself:

&gt;user ashadocat just created /r/HumanistAtheism which is intended to be a similar sort of idea as atheismplus (concerned with social justice, minorities not being discriminated against, etc.) but without the lack of willingness to debate freaking anything.

now, we all know how much reddit hates cheaters right? most of us could probably dig up a thread where a sad sack approaches AskReddit for advice on how to handle his cheating girlfriend and there is no shortage of venomous, disgusting advice that ranges from elaborate psychological abuse to murder (Golden Misogyny awards, anyone?). 

Oh, but that's when there's a woman on trial. Let's see how reddit [handles] (http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/1aji6o/miss_trixie_owns_a_cheater_on_rrelationships/) it when its a fellow SIR. 

Well, first of its in best of which means obligatory ""WHY IS THIS IN BESTOF""

&gt;This is what passes for bestof quality these days? OP is obviously a bad husband and possibly a piece of shit, but this comment reads like some teenage jilted lover on a crusade to out all men as bastards at heart. [+281]

i missed the part where she was out to get 'all men' and not just the guy she was replying to. Guily conscience much?


&gt;Spot on. The whole thing screams of ""I was cheated on and now I'm taking it out on you"". Perhaps they should rename that sub to /r/judgeme. [+114]

THIS. SO MUCH THIS. btw it becomes /r/judgeme any times a woman painfully recounts sexual assault she suffered, so no need to change the name now. 

Some people do call the guy out, but clearer heads are there to throw cold water on it

&gt;no empathy at all... people make mistakes, it's called being human. It doesn't automatically make you the worst person in the world [+8]

wow, did I just see the 'E-word in mainstream reddit? knock me over with a feather. of course it was in defense of a fellow bro. 

&gt;This is the problem with r/relationships. Instead of giving advice and helping cheaters improve their lives and get on the right path, too many people are vindictive, petty, and only care getting that really good zinger in. This is not tough love, this is kicking someone when they are down. 

T_T    wont someone think of the cheater?

&gt;You don't get to address somebody's reasoning by being a c**t about what some internet stranger did. [+2]

OK this comment really isnt upvoted much but the slur kind of sums up what most of the people in that thread *want* to say

&gt;Too much White-Knighting in a thread created by someone asking for help/advice. This doesn't mean what he did was acceptable but it's a shame that it simply turned into a shaming thread against the OP. [+44]

OH NO NOT WHITE KNIGHTS! MAN THE BATTLEMENTS!

&gt;A self-righteous pamphlet against a person who already felt shitty. And the mob cheers as always, 'cause it's for the ""good side"", you know? [+24]

isnt it peculiar how reddit reserves their pity for the lowliest of the low? assuming of course, they can identify with them

&gt;People make mistakes. No one is perfect. So did this man. He was looking for some honest advice, or maybe just a kick in the ass to tell him to own up to his mistakes. Thats not what this person did. She just berated him and tried to make feel like a worthless human being. She didn't own anyone. She just projected her own visceral feelings about cheating and came off looking a like a self righteous bitch who has never made a mistake in her life. She can keep her contempt and her golden asshole to herself. [+10]

reddit's all about the hard truths and real talk, until they arent

&gt;oh look a buthurt person putting down someone who made a mistake and his looking for simple advice ... and that is the frontpage well that is nice. [+10]

This morning the blog made its appearance on [r/worldnews](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1az7rr/swedish_feminists_call_for_all_men_to_be_banned/) and with reddit being reddit, a shitstorm broke out.

Basically, the blog collects pictures of men spreading their legs in the public space (it seems like the blog has gone down so I'll just post some examples [here](http://machoikollektivtrafiken.se/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/bilder-fr-iphone-452.jpg), [here](http://machoikollektivtrafiken.se/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/bild-8.jpg) and [here](http://machoikollektivtrafiken.se/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/bild-9-300x225.jpg). As a white cis-male who used to wear baggy jeans and listen to misogynic hip hop as a teenager, I'm fully aware that this behaviour simply is a way to claim public space and intimidate people and that it's got nothing to do with the size of your scrotum. But reddit disagrees;:

* [""Tell them men have balls that is why we spread our legs, Jeez."" (+13)](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1az7rr/swedish_feminists_call_for_all_men_to_be_banned/c92ar6p)

Because, yeah obviously [this poor mans pants](http://machoikollektivtrafiken.se/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/2012-03-03-15.32.54-300x225.jpg) are practically bursting with majestic genetalia and has nothing to do with asserting male dominance (duh).

* [""Looks like a scam to collect a ton of men crotch shots."" (+28)]
(http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1az7rr/swedish_feminists_call_for_all_men_to_be_banned/c929gtw)

BECAUSE WE'RE ALL DYING TO SEE YOUR SWEATY NUTSACK AREN'T WE?

Now let's see what happens when a couple of redditors actually [make an effort (-23)](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1az7rr/swedish_feminists_call_for_all_men_to_be_banned/c928xgx) by [translating the article (-13)](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1az7rr/swedish_feminists_call_for_all_men_to_be_banned/c92ab5y) and posting it to the thread? And I'm serious, a person gets downvoted simply because they translated the FAQ from the blog. Suddenly a wild shitlord brigade appears! Here's a couple of gems:

* [""Can you go and fuck yourself where the sun doesn't shine - seriously fuck you.
There is nothing legitimate, reasonable or even remotely ok about this bullshit - the quest for space - please - it blows my mind that you are spamming this all over this thread - fuck off.""  (+21)](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1az7rr/swedish_feminists_call_for_all_men_to_be_banned/c92d6yz)

Yeah, thank you for bringing up legitimate proof that some MRA's are blowing this out of proportion just to whip up a shitmob. Here's my all time favorite:

* [""At any point while you were ""exposing subtle male oppression"" did you realize that you were also in fact collecting a website full of male crotch shots?
I think that aspect of all shows the incredibly transparent freudian view that feminists take of men. (ie I hate him but damn he sexy, but that's not my fault, it's his!)
I think it's time we expose female repression of men, they post themselves all over the internet forcing me to jack off to them, it's repression I say! They need to cover their sweet sexy asses!"" (+17)](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1az7rr/swedish_feminists_call_for_all_men_to_be_banned/c92bgzk)

To which one of the aforementioned redditors, [IamaRead](http://www.reddit.com/user/IamaRead) replies:

* [""(quoting ""male crotch shots"" and ""I hate him but damn he sexy"") is pretty much supporting feminism, not only because you are using sexist objectifying points but can't imagine women won't get wet when they see genitals. Nothing freudian here except for your need to project and sublime."" (-13)](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1az7rr/swedish_feminists_call_for_all_men_to_be_banned/c92c1yh)

Only to be greeted by:

* [""Again - please, go fuck yourself you c[slur]."" (+8)](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1az7rr/swedish_feminists_call_for_all_men_to_be_banned/c92d7ti)

It would seem as if one does not simply question male anatomy. Seriously reddit, just fucking roll over and die already.

[For the rest of July,](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/w3dmb/meta_charity_nominations_thread/) SRS is going to be promoting and linking to [Lakota People's Law Project](http://lakotalaw.org/). It's a fantastic organization and they just blew the lid off the state continuing to steal children from their mothers. They currently need funds to help fund their lawsuit against the state and return the children to their families.

""Currently, we are preparing a federal civil lawsuit to win the return of more than 2,000 native children illegally taken from their homes."" -from their website

##More information:

MORTALITY:
Lakotah men have a life expectancy of less than 44 years, lowest of any country in the World (excluding AIDS) including Haiti.
Lakotah death rate is the highest in the United States.
The Lakotah infant mortality rate is 300% more than the U.S. Average.
One out of every four Lakotah children born are fostered or adopted out to non-Indian homes.
Diseases such as tuberculosis, polio, etc. are present. Cancer is now at epidemic proportions!
Teenage suicide rate is 150% higher than the U.S national average for this group.

DISEASE:
The Tuberculosis rate on Lakotah reservations is approx. 800% higher than the U.S national average.
Cervical cancer is 500% higher than the U.S national average.
The rate of diabetes is 800% higher than the U.S national average.
Federal Commodity Food Program provides high sugar foods that kill Native people through diabetes and heart disease.

POVERTY:
Median income is approximately $2,600 to $3,500 per year.
97% of our Lakotah people live below the poverty line.
Many families cannot afford heating oil, wood or propane and many residents use ovens to heat their homes.

UNEMPLOYMENT:
Unemployment rates on our reservations are 80% or higher.
Government funding for job creation is lost through cronyism and corruption.

1/3 of the homes lack basic clean water and sewage while 40% lack electricity.
60% of Reservation families have no telephone.
60% of housing is infected with potentially fatal black molds.
There is an estimated average of 17 people living in each family home (many only have two to three rooms). Some homes, built for 6 to 8 people, have up to 30 people living in them.

DRUGS AND ALCOHOL:
More than half the Reservation’s adults battle addiction and disease.
Alcoholism affects 9 in 10 families.

[Comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/ukclo/this_woman_tears_the_fat_acceptance/c4w7aou)

The entire thread is pretty poopy. On a happier note, [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/ukclo/this_woman_tears_the_fat_acceptance/c4w8mj6) comment is pretty nice.

Fun fact, r/fitness, not everyone who is fat is unhappy. Another fun fact, some people value other things over how good of shape they're in. Sometimes they're writers, actors, scientists, counselors, IT people, inventors, economists, or a whole slew of other things! My God! It seems like they can still be whatever they want.

The sense I get from r/fitness lately is that *fitness is the most important thing, no exceptions.* If you aren't in shape, then shut your mouth. Not only is it incredibly irritating, but it shuts out people who might even want to get in shape. Their culture tells them that their body *defines* what they are, who they are, and what the world should think of them. This is an incredibly damaging viewpoint, frankly. Not every fat person is an awful person in the same way not every thin person is a good person.

Edit: Oh man, I read every single comment in here, and some of you have shared some powerful stories. I'm sorry fat-shaming has had such terrible effects on some of you, and I hope they don't stick with you forever.

  There's no punchline to that. /r/pics literally has nothing but pure unadulterated hate for people who aren't able-bodied or able-minded. Why do I say this?  

  I open a [thread about a girl with cerebral palsy winning prom queen](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/tbzt6/a_girl_with_cerebral_palsy_won_prom_queen_at_my/), expecting nothing but kind-hearted wishes and maybe even a few compliments as to how the girl looks for the prom. But nope, this is what we get instead.  

  &gt; They should call this the **Pity The Retard Award** [+515]   

  &gt;&gt;&gt; Pity the Retard Award While Simultaneously Making Us Feel Like Good Human Beings Award  

  &gt;&gt; ftfy [+323]  

  ...  

  &gt; As Zach Anner says, it is the sexiest of all palsies.
Didn't her dad go as escort? [+92]   

  ...  

  &gt; I swear to god I'm going to flip shit if people keep posting shit like this.
Y'all realize that shit like this happens because they feel bad for her? I mean fuck, I got nominated for Prom King because I became paralyzed my junior year and blah blah blah sob story whatever. I didn't want any part of that shit. Disabled people don't want to be paraded around because it makes you feel better if you treat us with pity and do shit like this.
Nothing annoys me more than when people try to pull shit like this and make it look like everyone is such a good person. [+501]  

  ...  

  &gt; Okay, why does that matter? Yay, a girl got an award because she happened to have a physical disability. Big fucking shit. Nobody deserves anything because they happen to have a disability. It's not a big deal for her to get it, actually unless she actual got it without/with less bias because of the Cerebral Palsy then she shouldn't of gotten it.  

  ...  

  &gt; Sure it is a nice thing to do. But they obviously singled her out because she had cerbral palsy. Kind of makes it a bad thing. Not to be mean and i know downvotes will ensue, but obviously there were more deserving girls [+23]  

  ...  

  &gt; I don't know this girl, never met her, never seen her in person. I can't tell if this is actually a true win, or a cruel joke. [+12]  

  ...  

  &gt; You're ignoring the other part of this. They've singled her out and mocked her. They pity her, so they let her have this one moment of false celebration. It's just like in the movies.
Or, teenagers have a good heart and are not vindictive, judgmental assholes. I dunno anymore.
&gt;&gt;I wouldn't say they're mocking her. It's both good hearted with a pinch of pity.
&gt;&gt;&gt;Probably not mocking, you're right. But it is all about ""I am such a good person I am going to vote for this pathetic human because they have nothing else going on for them,"" which is just as bad.  

  ...  

  &gt; I hate shit like this. Here, make the person with some sort of disability or social disorder the center of attention in a way that clearly shows they won out of pity or so that the idiots who aren't putting themselves in the persons shoes can rub one out to how good of a person they are for ""making the different person feel special"" when really it's obvious what's going on and the award becomes hollow and uncomfortable for the person receiving it. Fuck this misguided acts of charity, this isn't a t.v. high school on Disney it doesn't make them feel like a winner and you aren't a better person for handing the award over to them. You want to do something nice for the different person, try being their friend. [+5]  

  ...  

  And last, but certainly not least:  

  &gt; Maybe she won because she was a total slut. Don't jump to conclusions. ಠ_ಠ [+31]
      
Yeah, I know. No clever jokes or smilies. That's not because I have nothing clever to say. It's because I probably do, but I don't want to put any effort into making this seem funny or whimsical. This shit is absolutely unacceptable. 

You know, a moderator of r/pics may come along and read this. For when that happens, I have a little question for the mod team that needs answering:

###WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU?

Like, seriously. Do you people log into your accounts, fire up /r/pics, see someone **SLUT SHAMING A DISABLED PERSON** and go ""You know, this is good. I think this should stay in my subreddit."" ? Like, I'm genuinely curious. 

To end on an ironic note, there's a link at the top of /r/pics to a subreddit with ""minimal rules"" called r/images. Like, could the bar possibly be set *any* lower? That's a rhetorical question.

Because it's pretty gross and the thread is still young. BTW, TRIGGER WARNING for misogyny, talk of rape, and ALSO for the article: it describes the murder with some detail.

First of all, here's a [link to the article](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/9788265/Teenager-falsely-accused-of-rape-beaten-to-death-by-gang.html), and [here is the reddit thread in question](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/16a63h/teenager_falsely_accused_of_rape_beaten_to_death/).

If reddit had read the article, they would know that the teenager was NOT falsely accused of rape and furthermore that the ""rape accusation"" thing happened TWO YEARS PRIOR to his death, but that's what they're sticking with, and so naturally, the comments get really shitty.

Let's get this one out of the way first:
[Why did I immediately think this happened in India?](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/16a63h/teenager_falsely_accused_of_rape_beaten_to_death/c7u792c) +12 [screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/STn8R.png)

Ok, now we can move on to hating women.

[She should be charged with the same penalty that he would have if he had been found guilty.](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/16a63h/teenager_falsely_accused_of_rape_beaten_to_death/c7u52rx) +64 [screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/4pQC9.png)

With lovely replies of:
[Won't happen. If she gets hit with anything it will be very small in comparison to what she deserves. This is, sadly, one of the things that women tend to get away with. Just look at Brian Banks.](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/16a63h/teenager_falsely_accused_of_rape_beaten_to_death/c7u5e91) +48 [screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/YOnUV.png)

And:
[Should it happen? Fuck yes. Will it happen? Fuck no. The problem is that everyone will say ""But if we charge her for falsely accusing someone of raping her, there's a good chance that women who were actually raped will be too afraid to come forward and report it"". As terrible as this sounds, it is what happens. And I actually know people who agree with this logic.](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/16a63h/teenager_falsely_accused_of_rape_beaten_to_death/c7u63ui) +25 [screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/k9I9A.png)

Also, women aren't evil, but actually, they totally are:
[With rape, people just can't comprehend that someone could possibly lie about it. It just really doesn't register with them and plenty are deathly afraid to suggest otherwise because THEN they're a mysoginist. Realize that, at least in the US, if a woman claims that she was afraid for herself that the man, even if he never touched her and even if he was assaulted by HER, he can very easily be the one taken to jail. It's all sorts of messed up these days. Women aren't evil, but when they are the law is stacked so much against a man if he doesn't have people to back him up it is ridiculous.](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/16a63h/teenager_falsely_accused_of_rape_beaten_to_death/c7u72jh) +10 [screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/nPUyx.png)

Also, this woman should be charged with murder:
[the rape accuser should be charged with murder](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/16a63h/teenager_falsely_accused_of_rape_beaten_to_death/c7u5f5e) +8 [screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/K994O.png)

Actually, instead of hating on just this one woman, let's hate on feminists too:
[False accusations don't happen feminists told me so.](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/16a63h/teenager_falsely_accused_of_rape_beaten_to_death/c7u5er3) +64 [screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/igXI9.png)

And while we're at it, SRS is just the worst:
[In the SRS universe every man is a rapist as long as he has a penis.](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/16a63h/teenager_falsely_accused_of_rape_beaten_to_death/c7u6sh2) +21 [screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/ybNkp.png)

Also, Reddit is shitty.",227,89,43,http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/1ihahy/first_effort_reddit_hates_teenage_girls_also/,"So, there's [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/1igkuz/some_girl_tossed_this_behind_her_seat_on_the/) thread about a girl who drew a cute thing while on the airplane. I thought it was clever, and forgot Reddit was Reddit, so I went to the comments to hopefully indulge in one of the few things Reddit does well on occasion; cute jokes.

Of course, this is Reddit, and she's a teenage girl, and I don't know why I expected anything different.

&gt;[I hate when people who can obviously draw well, and know it well enough to want to show others, say ""I can't draw that well"". Bitch please.](http://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/1igkuz/some_girl_tossed_this_behind_her_seat_on_the/cb48gje) +1142

Yeah, I wonder why a young girl would feel self-conscious. I mean, she's basically living in a world filled with positive reinforcement and encouragement for young women, right? Oh wait.

Approximately 400 other people made this exact comment in this thread.

&gt;[I thought it was cute until I got to that sentence. I now hate the anonymous young woman.](http://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/1igkuz/some_girl_tossed_this_behind_her_seat_on_the/cb4cp3z) +11

I kind of have a feeling you hate a lot of anonymous young women, slugger.

&gt;[Shes definitely the kind of girl that when asked about herself comes up with a completely off the wall list of random things, likes and dislikes.](http://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/1igkuz/some_girl_tossed_this_behind_her_seat_on_the/cb4c7xu)+80

Stereotyping is fine when it's about a teenage girl. When black people or gays or whatever are stereotyped, while those comments are *always* upvoted, usually there are a lot of people call them out; sometimes those even get upvoted too.

Not so when it's about teenage girls, though. It's the one group of people Reddit universally hates.

&gt;[16 y/o girl logic. She just needed an excuse to give it to him](http://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/1igkuz/some_girl_tossed_this_behind_her_seat_on_the/cb4d8hv)+46 

You rarely read something like (16 year old boy logic) on Reddit, no? Of course, most of them *are* 16 year old boys, so maybe that makes sense.

&gt;[Lost me at exclamation point hearts](http://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/1igkuz/some_girl_tossed_this_behind_her_seat_on_the/cb4be1j)+35

Because they're girly. And fuck that shit.

&gt;[Oh god it sounds like myspace.](http://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/1igkuz/some_girl_tossed_this_behind_her_seat_on_the/cb4cftz)+34

Notorious for being a place that girls expressed themselves.

&gt;[Saying that you can't draw well when you obviously can draw is like saying, ""I am so fat!"" when there are fatter people than you in the room.](http://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/1igkuz/some_girl_tossed_this_behind_her_seat_on_the/cb4bqwd)+33

It's amazing (and by that I mean I don't know what I expected) how many people make this exact same fucking comment, hate the girl for it, and don't even begin to consider that maybe she actually does feel self-conscious about her art.

&gt;[And...?](http://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/1igkuz/some_girl_tossed_this_behind_her_seat_on_the/cb48vjz) +320

In response to OP saying he was 18 and she was 16.

For the record, I am not against an 18 year old having a relationship with a 16 year old (maybe I should be, I don't know; as of now, I am cool with it) but, as expected, Reddit doesn't give a shit that it's kinda borderline. In fact, due to her age, she's likely easier to coerce, right Reddit?

&gt;[All I could think of was ""t3h PeNgU1N oF d00m"".](http://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/1igkuz/some_girl_tossed_this_behind_her_seat_on_the/cb4cjcg)+40

At least a dozen comments reference this stupid 4chan meme, speaking of places that hate teenage girls.

The thread linked to [this photograph](http://i.imgur.com/4ZusQ.jpg) of her injuries. Because the thread was posted right around the time that [Slutwalks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SlutWalk) were occurring throughout the United States and because /r/reddit.com had a much larger subscription count than 2X, the thread very quickly exploded in popularity. 

Now deleted user and fearless Internet detective, I_FRIENDZONE_CATS, stepped forward to bravely make [this post](http://i.imgur.com/jhJhf.png) - [+438]: 

&gt; I really, REALLY don't want to say this is fake, and I'm sorry that the internet has done this to me... but [you have a history of using effects makeup to look like a zombie.](http://i.imgur.com/A9EXh.jpg)

&gt; I don't know why you would fabricate this story... but I don't know why someone would pretend to have cancer either.

&gt; Again, what happened to you is terrible but I'm the tiniest bit skeptical.

CUE. EPIC. SHITSTORM.

Bolstered by I_FRIENDZONE_CATS' reference to theoculus's use of zombie makeup, swarms of Redditors piled on the post. Reddit user lmsft stepped forward [to give his take on the matter *as a medical student*](http://i.imgur.com/MQYaD.jpg):

&gt; I'm not a doctor, but I play one on the internet. (aka medical student)

&gt; The eye is a hard call, it looks convincing, but from my limited expertise, I would actually say that there is a strong possibility it is fake. the bruising is atypical of a single strike [...] she would likely have broken blood vessels in her eye, but it appears to be completely white. the area around the laceration is remarkably bruise free there is high level of bruising yet almost no visible swelling and most of all, the contusion stops very conveniently around her hair line and eyebrow. 

&gt; Like you I don't want to call fake if this is real. But some opinions, 1.) Reddit isn't the place to go with this, your local police and possibly news is. 2.) Women who, for any reason, ever claim fake rape are among the scum of the earth. Not only does it detract significance from actual rape cases, it can land innocent people in serious trouble. 3.) Possibly it is a bias due to my foreknowledge of her stage makeup expertise, but it REALLY looks like good makeup.

The opinion of a medical student pretending to be a forensic pathologist and of a guy named I_FRIENDZONE_CATS was all Reddit needed to make up its mind. Hopeful future Internet Detectives applying to The I_FRIENDZONE_CATS School of Internet Investigations, combed through theoculus's user history and dug up [rage comics critiquing rape culture](http://imgur.com/rScJS) and evidence of a history in the BDSM community. They then began referring to her as an ""anti-rape activist"" (which, by the way, what the fuck? Anti-rape activist? *Really?*). The prevailing theory presented in the /r/reddit.com thread was that theoculus was an anti-rape activist who was using a fake story of an attempted rape to bolster her cause. The comments in these albums are now downvoted, but at the time of first posting, they were at the top of the /r/reddit.com thread: [Album 1](http://imgur.com/a/ZUa21), [Album 2](http://imgur.com/a/N830y).
_______________________________________

The evidence against theoculus was then culled together by Internet Detective stingerbell, and posted in [this now deleted thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/kbn4q/looks_like_the_attemptedrape_story_at_the_top_of/). The evidence included such jewels as:

&gt; ""She has anal sex - even though she doesn't want to""

&gt; ""She admits taking illegal (hallucinatory) drugs.""

&gt; ""She seems to like having sex in public:""

&gt; ""She likes being burned during sex."" 

Some people were impressed by the evidence, but most people [were just creeped out](http://i.imgur.com/1F88T.png) [by the obvious character assasination inherent in this ""evidence"".](http://i.imgur.com/6iOIO.png) 
__________________________________________________________

The Internet Detectives in the /r/reddit.com thread quickly found the original 2X thread and informed 2X that they had been [faked out by a faker](http://i.imgur.com/3AfDD.png) leaving 2Xers [confused and upset](http://i.imgur.com/Eu9Rz.png).
