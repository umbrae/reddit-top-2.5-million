I was striking up semi-meaningful conversations with everyone I saw, dancing and making out with girls you might call ""out of my league"", all in all having a good time. And the next day, people I had only met the night before were visibly excited to see me again. Even a few people I had known from school who didn't seem to like me were suddenly very interested in what I had to say.

Without MDMA, I could not see any of this happening, as I'm usually incredibly awkward around all but my closest friends. It's not like I had a negative outlook on life to begin with, but now that I know what I'm capable of socially, it is somewhat depressing to see how much I miss out on on a regular basis. I want to love everyone and have a genuine interest in their lives. I want to be able to say things that make them happy. I want to feel like I'm rolling all the time. But I don't want to abuse a drug for that.

I guess this kind of looks like your typical ""how do I talk to people lol"" askreddit post, but as I learned over the weekend, I already know how to talk to people. I just want to be able to train myself to overcome my inhibitions as if I were on MDMA without relying on the substance.

",68,8,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/MDMA/comments/16w7hw/first_timer_250mg_dose_i_have_been_reborn/,"I bought some molly from a good friend of mine a week or two ago, I've been meaning to roll for a while I just didn't have the right circumstances for it to be a pleasant experience. 

Soon enough, I have plans to get really high with my friend because we were both very excited and curious about the nature of this drug. 

Yesterday night, crushed my crystals up (200mg) into a relatively fine powder and parachuted it. My friend did the same, we had received advice that 250mg was a stupid dose for a first timer and we should do 120-150mg and then re-dose if needs be, but we got conflicting advice from another who said do 200mg then 50mg when we peak. We decided to go with the latter advice. 

10:30PM Both parachute 200mg of MDMA 

11:00PM Discussing the lack of effects, getting slightly discouraged. 

11:30PM Decide that it would be a bad idea to do the rest of the MDMA yet just in case we start feeling it very soon. Do it anyway (50mg). 

12:00PM Heaven; energy is flowing from my fingertips, I'm touching the walls and the floors and I'm on the brink of tears, my friend is in the same situation. We strip down to our boxers because we feel like the aura of love surrounding us is enough. Lot's of hugging. 

12:30PM Introspective discussions ensue, deep heart to heart talk is being had, we now feel like we're the same person and that our brains are shared. Crying over the bond we've made. We are now brothers. 

01:00AM We both grab our iPods and select the same song, we press play at the same time. Jimi Hendrix's ""Bold as love"" is the song of choice. I can taste the notes, and feel the vibrations ripple through my body, every strum is an auditory orgasm. I stood up because I NEEDED to dance, I felt like a string, a string belonging to a harp being plucked softly. My body just flowed like a river of silk. 

01:30 About 4 litres of water later and a very achy jaw, we started feeling really mellow. My friend accidentally spilled some water on the carpeted floor and I was compelled to step in it. When I did, the only way I can explain it is referencing James Cameron's Avatar where the Naavi connect to nature using their hair. My foot just become the world and I felt the entire floor as if it was me. 

The rest of the night was just talking about philosophy and happiness. I got to sleep around 4:30AM which I was quite happy with. Although it did take a lot of focus and relaxation to steady my mind when my eyes were closed as to avoid nausea.

Hatred has completely disappeared from my life, I've been enlightened, my life goal is just to make people happy, and explain that it's not about how much money you have, or you SAT scores, it's about smiling and feeling love for everything. 

I love you all.

Don't know where else this has been but the more people it gets out to the better. This is from a local underground music group:

&gt;Harm reduction announcement:
&gt;
&gt;I'm working at the provincial toxicology lab, and we just confirmed a death in Vancouver caused by PMMA. There was a cluster of these back in 2011 in both BC and Alberta, which you may have heard about in the media, but this is the first one in about a year and a half. This might mean that a new batch of MDMA laced with PMMA has hit town.
&gt;
&gt;In case you're not familiar with PMMA: it's a molecule closely related to MDMA, but with much less of the desired empathogenic/euphoric effect, and unfortunately quite a bit more toxicity. The dose curve is a lot steeper, and the effects are delayed compared to MDMA. Often what has happened in these fatalities is that somebody takes one or two pills, and doesn't get the expected effect, so takes more, and that's enough to push them over into the toxic range.
&gt;
&gt;The toxicity looks basically the same as an overdose of MDMA, causing serotonin syndrome. Symptoms might include:
&gt;-Fast heart beat
&gt;-Overheating
&gt;-Excessive sweating
&gt;-Shivering
&gt;-Headache
&gt;-Involuntary twitching of the legs
&gt;-Twitching of the eyeballs (here's an example: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uck3zKhusRI)
&gt;-Confusion and agitation, eventually leading to unconsciousness
&gt;
&gt;If you see someone who looks like they have these symptoms, get them medical attention immediately! In the meantime, try to cool them down, and give them some water if they can still drink.
&gt;
&gt;It's important to mention that the recent deaths have been caused by PMMA _mixed_ with MDMA, not PMMA alone. This means that pill testing kits (from Dancesafe, etc.) can't pick them up! They will show a normal purple/black reaction because of the MDMA mixed in.
&gt;
&gt;I know some of this is a bit technical, so if any of you have questions, feel free to send me a message!

This is particularly relevant to those of you who appreciate the powdered/crystalline form of MDMA.  I promise to keep it as short as possible, but I also don't want to leave out anything that might help someone relate to this or will allow them to brush it off. Tl;dr at the end for the invincible out there.

I have been an occasional lover of E since around 1999. Typically lived by the self-appointed rules most of you seem to embrace: once a month, if even that, but willing to bend the rules for worthy occasions.  Took a bit of a hiatus for the sad years where EDM practically disappeared, at least in my part of the US. A little over a year ago I was overjoyed to realize that the music I loved was back, but on a scale I would have never believed.  Quickly immersed myself in all of the fantastic new artists and genres that spoke to me, had a blast at every festival I could make it to, met many great new like-minded friends, and found my homegirl Molly again (she was around back in the day, but a very rare treat, at least to us). We partook, but with restraint.

Everything going lovely since then, until about a month ago. My ""buddy"" lives right around the way, and always got the fire at a reasonable price. He started getting a new batch, but it was a great time. Such a great time that I found myself doing things I never had before, like picking up more than enough for an evening, then going back to grab more for me and my buddies well before the night was out. I started making excuses to dose up. Instead of waiting for one of my favorite artist to come to town on a weekend, it was ""hey, I heard there's a great dub step night at this local joint"" on a Wednesday. Two times a week became three, became four. Picking up for myself what had once been more than enough for several of us.  Now, at this point, anyone in their right minds reading this will think ""what the hell, guy, have some self-control - you're a moron.""  What I can't stress enough is that I couldn't agree with you more, even at the time.  Even driving over to re-up ON THE WAY TO WORK in the morning, I would think ""wow, this is getting *way* out of control,"" and yet not even consider not following through. It progressed, rapidly. I'm not going to get into the details, but suffice it to say that I am terribly disappointed in myself for some time of the things that have transpired over the last few weeks.  And then, today.

For the last three nights I slept once, Tuesday night for three hours.  Straight through Monday and Wednesday night, with all of the good intention of ""ok, one last little taste, then I really need to get some rest.""  Drinking a beer this morning on the way to work instead of coffee so I could straighten up a bit.  And even then, wondering how I could possibly grab a bit more at eight o'clock on a Thursday morning.

The gears must have been turning, albeit slowly and without my conscious help, for awhile. Finally, sobering up a bit at lunch today it struck me that something was seriously wrong with this. I had passed it all off to myself, with minimal effort, that this was just a silly little binge, they happen, and no doubt due to some of the drama going on in my life at the moment. But snippets of information I must have collected subconsciously over the years came together like a lightning strike. I quick hopped online and confirmed my growing fears.  Guess what: looks like I became a meth-head without even trying!

For those of you that don't have any reason to know this, as I didn't until today, they are *very* similar in their effects on the brain/body. Both target serotonin and dopamine receptors (simplifying greatly here; feel free to demonstrate your street-pharmacy knowledge in the comments), but with the opposite emphasis. The results of which can be thinking you are getting a great, if a bit speedy, roll. You may notice that it lasts a bit longer, and is a bit more difficult to let go of than what you're used to, but it fooled the hell out of me, and I'm no stranger to entertaining substances.

So here's the meat and potatoes (finally, right?).  Please watch out for this.  I've always kept well clear of what I believed to be the life-destroying drugs, so I had no reference for this. After over a decade of responsible enjoyment, I prided myself on knowing the taste of MDMA on my tongue. This fooled me completely. Here's one of many references you can find with a quick google search detailing some of the differences between the two: http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/498484-MDMA-vs-Meth-vs-Amphetamines. Testing kits are well worth the meager price. Wish I hadn't been such a procrastinating bastard and had picked one up like I had meant to forever.

What can I say? I'm mentally and physically exhausted, disgusted, fucking full of self-righteous anger, and still having to fight swinging by and grabbing one for the road on my way home.  I'm also indescribably thankful that I made the connection before things went past the point of no return (and they were heading there quickly).  I've never heard this story before, so if it helps even one of you fine people, or at least gives you some ammo for the future, then the hour and a half and three Delirium Tremens I spent writing it was well worth it.  I made this throwaway account for this post, but if anyone is in this or another similar situation that they need to talk about, I'd be happy to talk with you and offer whatever support I can.  Much respect to those who made it through this novel of a post, and for those who didn't:

Tl;dr:  Enjoyed MDMA for over a decade responsibly, then found myself inadvertently strung out on meth.

1362605966.0,50,self.MDMA,19suax,"Can we please stop using ""Molly"" in place of MDMA? [Rant]",76,26,84,http://www.reddit.com/r/MDMA/comments/19suax/can_we_please_stop_using_molly_in_place_of_mdma/,"It's hard to ignore that with the recent EDM boom, MDMA has become thee drug to take and use. I'm not saying everyone at EDM events takes drugs or they need drugs to party/dance but it's hard to ignore how easily the term ""Molly"" is being thrown around. I understand it's suppose to be a cute and easy nickname as with Lucy and Mary Jane. 

But from my experiences here's what I've seen been called ""Molly"":

* MDMA

* MDA

* Pressed ecstasy pills (they were cut mind you)
* Methylone
* 4-MEC
* Butylone
* MPA
* Research Chemical cocktail (not sure how else to explain it)

Here's what I've seen ""Molly"" cut with: 

* Meth

* Speed

* Piperazine
* Methylone
* PMA

I know alot of people either don't have money for a test kit or don't want the awkwardness of buying one but it's hard nowadays to ever be sure if it's pure mdma without one. I've seen plenty of rager/party kids that buy whatever they can get their hands on and take it without a second thought. 

But due to the high popularity of ""Molly"" and having majority of buyers accepting whatever's sold as ""Molly"" without a second thought, Dealers are doing shady shit such as cutting product or passing off other drugs as ""Molly"". I've seen it happen and most dealers don't care since it sells.

Testing product before you buy or buying in small amounts means you know what you're getting. If it's bad then you don't buy any or anymore. It's the best way to regulate it. Also, using proper terms can fuck with your dealers head (or at least I've noticed). If you know more about mdma or research chemicals than your dealer or they get sketched out when you ask to test, then you shouldn't be buying from them in the first place. I know not all dealers are janky people looking to make money through selling bunk but these types of dealers outweigh the good types. 


**TL;DR What I'm getting at is if you love MDMA, get a test kit. If you love Methylone, get a test kit. Even if you love taking pressed ecstasy pills, get a test kit. Just because someone says it's ""Molly"" doesn't mean it's MDMA.**

**The government isn't regulating and instead taking the stance similar to how they taught abstinence for sex (just don't have it). But drugs, it's illegal so don't do it. Using test kits and being knowledgeable about what you're buying is the best way to regulate, not get ripped off, and not sold something that can be inherently bad.**

Okay, so over New Years I went to a music festival and decided that there was no better time to try LSD, because I was with some of my best friends and in a great setting.  Two friends and I end up candy flipping (LSD + MDMA) that day/night.  

This is how our day played out: drop our tab around 2 pm, boost with 100mg MDMA around 4, another 50mg around 6.  Now onto my freakout: At the festival we boosted a final 50mg out of capsules (you know this almost gelatinous kind?), and about 15-20 minutes later I feel something strange on the inside of my cheek.  I start probing it with my tongue, and it feels as if it is a flap of skin is hanging off the inside of my mouth.  I start getting kind of nervous, ""Did I really just chew on my cheek so hard that I ripped a chunk of skin off? I've heard stories of shit like this happening, oh fuck, oh fuck!"".  Finally after about 5 more minutes of probing, the piece comes off, and guess what it was?  It was that damn pill capsule.  I had forgotten I put it in my mouth and was just sucking on it, and it ended up getting stuck to my cheek.

I laughed to myself in my head and kept on dancing.

1371494285.0,41,self.MDMA,1gj4xz,My girlfriend and I rolled together for the first time. The experience changed us. Is the change to stay?,46,5,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/MDMA/comments/1gj4xz/my_girlfriend_and_i_rolled_together_for_the_first/,"About two months ago, my girlfriend and I tried an Extasy pill for the first time. I'll probably lack words to describe this midblowing experience properly, but there were some long-term effects that I'd really want to share (and see if anybody else had similar). I'm not a native English speaker so please don't laugh at my grammar or spelling ;-)

A bit of background - we are together for almost 4 years, love each other immensely, both are around 35 and have some fucked up relationships in our pasts, and not exagerrating we have found a heaven on earth in being together. I've never been so happy with anyone else in my life like I am with her.

Neither of us has ever tried MDMA before, and we are not into clubbing at all, so we just decided to have the experience together. We heard many times about how it brings people together, how wonderful the touch is, etc., so we hoped to cuddle a lot, make love if possible (I stacked up on some Viagra pills to help me get it up, I learned that much from the Internet), and just enjoy each other. Yep. Two people that have no idea what they are doing, what to expect, or even how long it is going to last.

This was the plan: We were visiting family in another country, and our flight back was scheduled to be very late in the evening on Sunday. Our car was waiting for us in the airport parking, and safely locked in its trunk were a couple of Mortal Combat (Red Dragon?) pills I got from a trusted vendor on SR. Instead of driving the 80 or so miles back home, we booked a room in a hotel on our way about 20 miles in, and we looked forward to have a blast there.

Of course even the best plans sometimes go to hell, and so it was with this one - we had some car troubles, then we couldn't find the hotel, then we were looking for a parking space for half an hour... so when we finally got to our room we were too tired for anything. We just undressed, jumped into bed, and were fast asleep in no time.

We woke up early in the morning (I think around 7am), took a shower together, and decided to go with the original plan. I took one Viagra and one Extasy pill (I'm quite a big guy, so I figured that the 220mg of MDMA in a Mortal Combat pill should be just enough for me), and my girl took a half. We laid down again, cuddled a bit... but nothing has been happening. We had nice and sensual morning sex, then napped for maybe 15 minutes, then shrugged, told ourselves that the pill probably was fake, packed up, and left the hotel.

On my way to the car I felt for a moment a slight dizziness but decided that it was probably just the lack of breakfast. So we got in, and I started to drive.

Five minutes in, she tells me that she is not feeling too well. Dizzy, a bit nauseous, her heart is racing and she's really scared. She is afraid that it won't end well. We are now driving through a stretch of a motorway-ish road with nowhere to stop or turn. I suddenly start experiencing similar effects to her, so I slow down, try to focus on driving - but holding her hand at the same time. It's not so bad, I say to myself, it will pass in a moment. I open the windows, hoping for the wind to sober us up, while looking for the place to stop the car safely. Then we drive through a tunnel. The sound echoing from the walls comes to me in a strange reverbating / muffled kind of way. My whole body, every square inch of skin starts to tingle. For maybe 10 or 15 seconds I have the feeling of being outside of myself, completely depersonalised. Who is this person driving this car? My hands on the steering-wheel feel like a memory or a dream about holding a steering-wheel. I tell her that I definitely need to stop somewhere or I'll crash the car. She is really scared and says that she thinks she's dying. The tunnel ends. And suddenly... quite a nice warm wave of a feeling starts to replace all the unpleasant effects I felt just a moment before. I tell her that she shouldn't worry, it's already passing for me, so she will be better very soon.

She says that she needs to close her eyes and get hold of herself. Still scarred and dizzy. Two minutes pass and she says - OK, I think I feel a bit better now. Actually... I FEEL PRETTY GOOD! 

I've been feeling at least PRETTY DAMN GOOD for a few minutes by this moment, just didn't want to say anything that could interfere with her getting hold of herself. But when she admitted that something veeery niiiiice is happening to her, and she does like it now, I just started laughing overwhelmed with joy. She joined me immediately. Oh my, how we laughed. My hand touching her hand felt like the best thing ever, like a nexus of love and sexual energy. The world seemed to be brighter, sounds louder and better defined. Laughing felt like orgasms. I had a boner pointed straight home.

We spend some time describing to each other how we feel, sharing the experience. Then we start telling each other about our love. How happy we are to be together. Driving feels wonderful by now. I'm not distracted, I'm the one with my car. It's enough to think about the next maneuver, and it (he!) does it. She tells me that I drive very smooth now, like gliding. Not fast, very steady, in a way that is perfectly synchronized with the world, other drivers around us, and the flow of the traffic. I think I slow down with perfect understanding even before the braking lights on the car in front of us light up. Everything is smooth and perfect. We are going through London, and even though there were hundreds of slow-downs, red lights, etc., I somehow do it perfectly -  we go through the whole city without stopping even once, just a single, smooth, flowing drive. Later I'll see that I got incredible mileage out of gallon during that ride - but I don't care at this moment. I just enjoy the feeling.

We talk more. Different themes, but all is full of love, understanding, happiness, togetherness. Now we are outside of the city and the plush vegetation of south-east starts to envelop us. And the really funky stuff begins. The trees... they're fuzzy! Plush, soft, like fluffy clouds or candy floss (cotton candy). The colors - so intense, that they seem unnatural. Like something from a fairytale, or from animated movie. Grass is rich, deep, almost meaty. Everything seems to be breathing together with the wind, and everything cuddles us. We are amazed. We are commenting on everything we see. On us together. On love and happiness. On a separate thread, somehow, I am able to be still fully focused on driving - still one body with the car. On separate thread my teeth clatter like castanetes, and it makes us laugh again and again - even that seems to be so sweet.

Finally, we got home. Managed to get out of car, upstairs, to the bedroom. Cuddling, kissing, french kissing, licking fingers - wow, what an amazing feeling. She put her tongue deep in my mouth, tickling my palate and it was one of the most amazing things I've ever felt. Did the same to her, she loves that too. We undress. Caress. Cuddle more. Have the most intense sex of our lifes - slow, but deep, pleasure building and building to the levels previously unknown. I'm not sure how long it was, but it felt like several amazing hours.

Then we spend time quietly, not talking, just looking each other in the eyes.

Then we sleep.



Since then, something changed. We are two months later, after that single MDMA-powered day. Vegetation, trees, grass - even though it's lacking the amazing colors and cartoonish quality, is still... different. More rich, more intense. We both still see (or just notice) shapes, we wouldn't be aware of before our Extasy roll. Everything seems to be much more lush, we have started to notice and appreciate the beauty of the world around us. Literally, for both of us this is the most beautiful spring ever. We still can see the 'fuzinness' in some trees and bushes, although it depends more on their texture and light. Ah, the light - it's everywhere. I've never before noticed what the light does to the world.

Us two - just the same. Feeling closer and more together than ever. Again, more appreciative. We always were good friends, but now we are even better. Every time we make love, it's the best sex ever. We hold hands much more often, kiss with renewed passion, we are more open when talking about our desires, dreams or what troubles us. We know each other better, and we love each more even more. There is a whole new quality to life resulting in much more joy from the small things, like brushing teeth together, walking through a park, or just enjoying a movie.

So, in the end - questions. Did anyone experience such a profound change from just one MDMA trip? Does the effect wear of in time? (for us it's already almost 2 months, and it's still there.) Is this a typical MDMA experience? Should we try again, or do we risk a disappointment? If we do try, what funny/nice/pleasant things should we try? I guess this time, if we do it, it will be less of a revelation, more of an exploratory experience... Share your thoughts :)

TL;DR - It's about beauty. It took quite a long time to write, shouldn't take so long to read - so just do it. Thanks.


EDIT: Hey guys, I know I was a dumbass for driving under influence. What can I say... For some reason this stuff took over 90 minutes to start working. When I was getting into the car, I was sure that it was fake and I got scammed by the seller. Then when it worked, I got nowhere to stop. I slowed down, looking for a place to drive off the road. Then all the funky stuff with my body ceased, and it was pure mental bliss - and I admit, at this point I wasn't any good with critical thinking anymore. So I drove on.

But with MDMA, I find that no matter how long it's been, if somebody has this glowing first time and they are just bursting at the seams with stories about how great it was you can't help but get those tingles as well.. because the experience itself is so profound and yet so sober.  Classic psychedelics really reveal parts of your brain you've never imagined, but MDMA just shows you what it's like to love, dance and truly be free without any kind of barriers.  It's the most human experience -- emotions that even your sober self can relate to.  

So no matter what kind of day I'm having, when I come on here and read about somebody's first time and how they just want to share how beautiful it is with everybody, it's hard not to smile and feel great.

I'm really sorry if this sort of thing is frowned upon but I had an epiphany that's altered my life when I rolled for the first time last night and I want to share it and say thanks. 

A bit of background for this story: me and my friends are seniors in high school. I hope that doesn't invalidate any of what I say because I feel that even though I am young and have a lot left to learn that this is a lesson ill take away for life. 

As I was dancing with two of my friends who were also rolling, we ended up sitting down and having a heart to heart. One of my friends in question attempted suicide earlier this year and struggled with alcoholism. My other friend who has severe self esteem issues was there as well.

As we danced there and talked, we came to realize something: how good life is. We sat there, amazed and feeling fucking fantastic because we had just come to the realization that we were 3 young kids, senior years ahead of us, with 4 limbs, a healthy brain, and people who love us. For fucks sake, we live in a first world country! People die for that opportunity. We've been caught up in our own worries for so long that we've never stopped to pause and just think about what we've been handed. And because we were rolling hard as hell, we got up and danced like morons just to celebrate that we could. We have whole lives ahead of us and that's something that not everyone can say.

My friends who've struggled with their various problems realize this too. I've never seen them so happy and I've been going fucking crazy trying to get them to here. Self esteem friend has never been so confident as he is post-roll. Suicide friend looks back on what sparked his depression now, and he sees a learning experience, not a traumatic incident.  

Today I'm typing this on my iPhone from a cafe in a nearby city just watching the cars and people pass and I realize everything is beautiful. I've never felt like this, like it's just a joy of being alive and healthy. It feels beautiful knowing I can walk, run, jump and think when some people live handicapped for life. 

Sorry r/MDMA for this rant. I don't know if this kind of post is considered bad around here because I don't frequent this subreddit. But thanks, too. Thanks for reading this, and sorry again if it's stupid. Thank you MDMA because it has facilitated a new take on life. When I realized all this, I was rolling. HARD. But these are 100% sober thoughts and I pray ill never forget the lesson learned. 

To all of your health, and many more good rolls.

I just was making my latest batch of marquis and thought it would be awfully kind of me to offer Marquis tests for free, so I am!  I'll send you a 5ml bottle of Marquis reagent and a color key, all for free.  
I make some for my friends all the time and I always see more people who need some, so I hope by giving it away for free more people will have access to a testing reagent.

The catch is you have to be in the US, cause its WAY to expensive to ship out of country.

Feel free to PM me if you're interested or have any questions!

Edit: Whoa! I wasn't expecting this to be so popular!  I thought just a few people would wanting free tests.  Im really pretty stoked at everyone that wants to be safe and roll responsibly. I am stilling giving stuff away but I've had so many requests that I've had to order some more small bottles for everyone!  If you PMed me last night, your tests will be headed out later this week, most others yours will be leaving early next week after I get more supplies.

I will accept donations, PM me for PayPal info.  These are CHEAP to make (~$2 each) so anything you want to give will help SO much!

Thanks for the interest and I love hearing your stories! Peace and trips!

Edit#2.  7/8/13: I've been getting a bunch of requests and am still taking them, but they will go on a three week list so I don't have to ship a huge amount of packages at once.  Thanks!

Edit#3 7/11/13: Thanks to the generous giving of a few, Ive bought the reagents for the mandelin test, and will be sending that out to those who are interested.
Some people have asked if they could help by buying some,so I'll put up the link to my auctions.

I did it anyway. I'm not making this post to get lectured about anything, I just want you guys, who are probably smarter then me and handle MDMA with care to know what happens really and how it feels.  
  
  
It's Saturday and I got my pills, 2 of them, tested, and very good. (This is in The Netherlands).  Even though my friend advice me to drop a quarter first, I just threw the whole thing in at 00:20, I don't remember much of my roll because of the repeated use of various pills through the weekend but I do know that I rolled very fucking hard from 00:20 to around 04:50 (dropped the second pill at 02:00). At something like 05:00AM I went to my friends house and did some hefty amount coke which got me right back on track.  
  
  
Decided to leave at 5:30 and my friend gave me 8 pills, but before I left I smoked some hash with him and walked home, on the way I dropped two pills and had some pretty fucking weird trip, not even rolling, everything seemed fake and every building had a 3D sort of outline on it (Was it even MDMA?).   
  
  
When I came home I dropped another half of a pill and decided it was enough, didn't sleep though, on Sunday I dropped the remaining 6,5 pills throughout the day and didn't even roll or anything, I didn't feel much of it, no comedown either, just normal, wen't to sleep after.  
  
  
Woke up at Monday and got another 4 pills, which were tested for MDMA, I dropped my first one at 21:30, didn't feel anything for 1:30 hours, dropped the second one, started feeling warm after the second pill and then I decided to just drop the second two.  
  
  
Now lets describe what I felt from those 4 pills.  I was rolling, but without the love and the good feelings, it almost seemed like I was on a huge amount of speed, after I sobered up I just became a zombie not knowing what I'm doing and not knowing what to think. I would zone out every few minutes/hours for 3-4 seconds and it would feel like my brain just ""shut-off"" for those few seconds, I didn't pay attention to it.  
  
  
And now we are at Tuesday when fucking hell breaks loose. I feel my body and brain trying to tell me that they cannot handle this, I can hardly walk or engage in any activity for more then 5 minutes before falling down from light-headiness and dizziness. When I would lie down my ears would explode making the worst ringing sound I've ever heard in my entire life and I would see white flashes before my eyes like Zeus was raping them with his lightning bolts, it was insane, I couldn't sleep at all. And today, I still zone out a lot, lose track of my memory and emotions, haven't lied down yet though, so I can't say for sure if the ringing and flashing thing is still there.  
  
  
Either way, I was a, and probably am a very, **VERY, VERY FUCKING STUPID CUNT** for doing something like this, I think I'm going to stay off MDMA for my entire life if not a lot of fucking years from now, seems like I have given my brain enough shit and it's telling me that what I did is not something to joke about very well.  
  
  
If you're reading this, thanks for your patience and interest, remember, **3 FUCKING MONTH RULE**.  
  
**DON'T GO ROLLING TWO CONSECUTIVE DAYS SAYING SOMETHING LIKE ""BUT I WON'T BE DOING THIS ANYMORE, IT'S JUST A ONE TIME THING!""**  
  
Enjoy it like you should be enjoying it, give your brains the rest they **NEED AND DESERVE** after rolling or you will feel like complete shit for a few weeks, at least that's what I'm expecting. It's good that I'm mentally somewhat strong but I can really imagine how I just could get suicidal thoughts or severe depression from this.",,False,self,t5_2qwvg,False,,,True,t3_1cj8v4,http://www.reddit.com/r/MDMA/comments/1cj8v4/my_experience_after_my_ecstasy_binge/,

I know it sounds completely counter-intuitive to sit down, perfectly still, by yourself, in a dark room, with your eyes closed, while rolling. I. Know. But the psychospiritual-medicinal-cognitive benefits are unparalleled. This will change your life. One minute of meditation on MDMA is equivalent to one hour in real life. If you spend 10 minutes meditation, that's 10 hours. I don't know if anyone here has completed a 10 day vipassana course in meditation, but MDMA does that entire course in one hour, and I have benefited more from meditation than anything else in my entire life.

I'm not condemning any other use of MDMA. Some of the best experiences I have ever experienced in my entire life were rolling with friends at home, at a rave, on the beach, you name it. I would never replace those experiences for anything else, and of course they had an impact on my life. *But meditation + MDMA, is secret magic of unparalleled potential*. I say it's the 'highest', but everything is equal. I'm not saying meditate instead of going to a concert, I'm just showing you one path less traveled. How many MDMA users have ever tried to meditate while rolling? Just try it. 

Don't take my word for it, experience it yourself. The next time you roll, sit down for 5-10 minutes, close your eyes, and pay attention to the lovely sensations pulsing through your body. **But, this is key: do this without growing attachment to the sensations, just observe them as they are**. If you're skeptical or think I'm full of shit, prove me wrong, and actually do this the next time you roll, and tell me I'm off base. 

You know the 'magic', and how that goes away? You are responsible for the magic, the only thing MDMA does is release the 5-HT. YOU, can turn that experience into whatever kind of magic you desire.",,False,self,t5_2qwvg,1365625532.0,,,True,t3_1c3443,http://www.reddit.com/r/MDMA/comments/1c3443/unlocking_the_highest_potential_of_mdma/,

I used to be a sort of naive kid who liked to go out and just get pissed. My interests didn't delve much further than being a sports fan and I was quite selective with who I would talk to and hang around with. 

Since taking MDMA, I think I now have a deeper character, I have much more significant relationships with my friends and other people. I talk to people who I never would have made much of an effort with before. Going through the process of going out and meeting new people all the time has carried on into my normal life and I feel I have broken down many social barriers. I feel quite disconnected to the things I was previously interested in prior to MDMA use. For instance, I study economics but I am getting so bored of my degree and feel like doing something more creative/free flowing. A lot of the things in life seem more fake to me now.

Despite meeting lots of new people I am also becoming more disconnected to people I used to hang around with. They appear quite superficial to me and I can't seem to have enough in common with them now to make good conversation or company.

I can not believe I have made it this far in my life without it. I have always been a bit socially awkward, unsure of myself physically and sexually and quite reserved. Tuesday night completely tore through all of that. It quite literally ripped my grasp on control away from me, and just let me be there, naked and exposed, overwhelmed with sunshine. I started with just 100mg, and took 300 more over the course of the night. So I wasn't completely out of it, I still had enough self control to be safe. 

Now, it is utterly absurd to me, that this is not used for therapy. I feel like a brand new person. My cheeks hurt from smiling so much this week. Having always suffered with some sort of depression/anxiety, I feel as if I have snapped out of that world, and into a new one. I know that I still feel this way because it has only been a few days, but I have NEVER felt so happy in my entire life. Never. So just to experience that alone makes it worth it to me. I am already planning another session a couple months from now. I was a bit overly excited at all of it, and kept my boyfriend awake until around 4 am, so i will try to assert a little more control over myself this time.

But sometimes the universe makes sure everything comes to place and gives you the chance of meeting MOLLY.

As it was very crowded , we could hardly find a place to crash and finally we ended up getting a super duper place right next to the beach.(This is where the universe started helping me)

It so happened that one of the best Trance Dj's ever DJ Astrix was playing right next to our shack. I was blown away on hearing this.
I have always wanted to see him  live.

My friends wanted to attend to but none of them wanted to do Molly. I was hell bent on trying it but was pretty scared to ask around.
(Universe starts playing it part again).

We went to another beach and one random person gave me a rave party flyer and asked me if i wanted to get some MDMA. I was like OMFG Yes. I got some MDMA.(Universe thank you)

Then i split it into 5 parts and did just 1 part. Close to about 30 mins in i was not feeling anything. Then i did a tiny bit more. 5 mins in I suddenly felt like there was spark inside me that was ignited. I felt liberated and a sudden wave of happiness hit me.

I felt like i turned Super Saiyan (Just love DBZ too much). I ran across the street and my frens had a hard time keeping up.

We reached the party and the music just got to me. It was still 30 mins for astrix to start .I was already dancing my ass off! A couple who were tripping next to me on LSD , who poured beer all over me and said ""u need to be hydrated , we know you are tripping! Happy dancing fren!"" - It was one of the best feelings ever, I never realised getting beer poured on your head could be this amazing.I thanked them and hugged them.

Then astrix came on and i danced like there was no tomorrow. I was not trying to dance hard but i just could not stop. I looked up and the  world looked a happier place where every single person was to himself , loving the moment and respecting the person next to him.

I had tears of joy. I hugged my frens. 

Astrix came down after the party and we got a pic with him. I just cant explain the feeling of hugging him and telling him Thank you.

These guys put everything they have to make us dance and its high time we respected every musician out there.

It was one of the best nights in my life .

Thank you molly and thank you universe!

But I really wanted to try something new and heard that molly was pretty fantastic. I did a good bit of research and decided to give it a shot even though I was nervous as hell that I would end up being one of those girls you hear about on the news that does something dumb and ends up dead...Just cause that's how I think for the most part. I got a half a gram and took 75 mg to start with because i'm not very big and didnt want to do too much. After about a half hour I felt it a little bit but not that much, so I did about the same amount again. Holy shit. I have never felt this amazing in my entire life. (still rolling right now). I'm  usually really shy and have a hard time talking, even to my boyfriend. But right now, i'm so open and just happy, it feels so fucking good. This feels like one of those profound moments that could potentially change my life. Don't know if that's a common feeling to have, but I love it! I'm gonna stop now just because I feel super silly and like a complete idiot, but I just wanted to thank you guys for the advice you give to  others, it helped me a lot in making my decision and i'm really happy I did!

Update: 2 pm, got a few hours sleep and I gotta say, the comedown off E was miserable and Ill never take that again, but I feel pretty fantastic after coming down from Molly.. This must be the afterglow people speak of!

I guess at the very least I am getting these thoughts out of my head because I am a little bit lonely right now, especially after going through something so powerful.

I did MDMA with some friends at a festival. It was one of those 3 day music festivals where a looot of people are on it. I was kind of timid about taking it. I've done it, maybe 4 or even 5 years ago.

I came to some major realizations.
I was timid before taking it because I was cozy with my worldview.
But my view of people kept me lonely and isolated.
I would judge people. And think myself superior. And make social situations try to revolve around me like I was some sort of genius.
But when the going got tough, and it was tough, I was tripping hard and I had to tell myself to hold on ""ohhhh boy, oh god this IS strong""...eyes rolling into the back of my head...things got very serious.

I was with a new friend that I had met a day before the festival.
He was so gentle and so kind, seriously just the man.
And he knew that things were getting serious for me.
And we just sat and watched the sunrise. It wasn't forced or anything but I spilled out all my fears to him.
It felt so good to let go of the guilt and the insecruity I have about myself.

I can be so god damn insecure. I hold myself away from others and I almost felt undeserving of love. These thoughts that I have...so unkind to myself. And it's hard because I could very clearly see that other people could see that I actively would degrade myself. And they would hold a silent pity for me almost...If only he knew.
And it hurts, too. The pain I cause myself. 

But I sat there...it was a cold night. And I had no choice. Surrender. Surrender to the cold. To the promise of the sun coming up on the horizon. Just wait. Just hold on. Be strong. Be so strong boy, you know not where you will go. Such goodness in this world.

And I could see it.
Out of nowhere a kind dude came up and ran his fingers through my friends hair... a token of respect and admiration.
WOW I thought...people ARE so kind.
And I would judge before this! 
I can be so foolish!

My eyes were opened to the brotherhood of humanity.
I am so small without my fellow humans.
And I can think I am so smart and so knowing...I can be so selfish.

I was once told that the most important skill you can have is to have meaningful relationships with other people.

It was my 25th birthday just yesterday and I now realize I barely know how to sustain caring relationships with others. No wonder why people never invite me out. How much time have I actually spent...making memories with the people in my life? Why do I choose to be cooped up in my room and on the internet?

Tough questions. It was hard. Things got serious.

I owe myself a beautiful life. Enough feeling sorry.

I have so far to go. I think things will be better though.

I know other people have gone through this. In the end it is all beautiful. It is all good. I will try my hardest to always, always to be there for you my fellow humans. I mean it, I love each and every one of you.",,False,self,t5_2qwvg,1343340255.0,,,True,t3_x7oyo,http://www.reddit.com/r/MDMA/comments/x7oyo/mdma_at_a_festivalmusings/,

After trying to drink the day later, I realised that not only had I lost interest, I couldn't actually physically drink alcohol anymore. When I say I couldn't physically drink, I don't mean I got drunk easily, I just couldn't do it, no matter how much I tried. I haven't touched alcohol since.

What I gathered:

- Most pills were pressed at lab in Orange County CA
- Dealers and users didn't know the actual dosage of the pills, but it was very consistent so you just dosed based on the number of pills taken.
- They were unstamped white presses
- They were freely sold at local bars near the Starck. Some bar owners made more money selling mdma than booze.
- But you had to ask for it, it's not like there were signs advertising mdma forsale.
- There were many celebrities who indulged.
- The pills were transported in large quantities via checked luggage. The guy I spoke to was only stopped once and then quickly let go.
- It spread to every major urban area quickly, sold by dealers directly in clubs.

So, even though it wasn't illegal, it was still treated with caution and kept underground as if it were. After it turned sched 1., then busts happened so quickly that all the players at the time quickly got out of the game.

Nobody got rich apparently. There just wasn't enough demand and the distribution was too provincial. 

Not surprisingly the quality turned to shit once it was made illegal and there were lots of adulterants appearing. Lots of people who really enjoyed it stopped completely because they worried about adulterants.

Reminds me a bit of the RC scene from years back.

It was a summers evening, I had not long swallowed a pill, a pill that  my friend said would talk me to another place not in this world. I didn't listen to him ""How much can a drug really effect you"" I kept thinking, ""I'll still be myself it will hardly affect me.""

We're still walking my friend asks me if I feel it, I don't reply. My step feels light, full of energy. ""This feels nice"" I think to myself, I was in for a surprise.

I remember reading somewhere that MDMA and music are a match made in heaven, so I reach into my pocket for my headphones, touching my thighs feels amazing, ripples of pleasure wash all over my leg.

I realise touching things feels amazing, I run my hands over the cold metal barrier on the side of the street. Metal has never felt so good.
I remember that I should be listening to music, so I put my headphones in and put on a song, a song that I didn't really listen to much.
www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWuPVBkqcfg

I couldn't of timed it any better, as soon as I put the headphones in the come up was kicking in ""This feels REALLY nice"" i think to myself.

 I hear the calming melody and it entrances me. Everything around me looks better. Everyone walking on the street looks friendly. My eyes darting from side to side felt amazing. The music itself felt like it was coming from the heavens, just for me, just to make every moment perfect. At that moment it became clear to me, I realized this is why they call it Ecstasy

Then the song dropped, everything else is a blur.

We are very close to begin with and we share quite well. 

We took our doses around 8p in our home. Before hand just because we wanted to be careful we safety proofed our house a good bit. Cleaned up put all the breakables in safe places and such. We turned down the AC a little lower than normal (76 F) also probably unnecessary but just in case.
About 45 min later as she was working on a puzzle and I was watching a football game in the same room I said something to the extent of 'I wonder if we took enough' to which she says 'I feel like I always say that when I take shrooms right before they hit me'

She was right. about five min later I looked at her and her eyes were huge and she was starting to get tactile. She covered up the puzzle put it away and we snuggled on the couch together. With in a few min we were both hugely tactile and rolling on the couch moving on each other and feeling the sheet textures. 
We started talking and connecting on an unparamounted level. We started sharing our inner selves and did so for the next six hours almost continually.

After a bit (probably 2 hours after dose) we started to foll around. It was really great, though after about 20 min of teasing and foreplay I could no longer get/stay hard. Sounds far more annoying than it really was.
At this point (2:30 ish after dose) for some reason I really forget we decided to take a shower together. RIGHT DECISION!!! I think it was the best physical experience of my life. We were sexual in the shower but the fact that we couldn't actually have sex did not bother ether of us. The feeling of hot water hitting my skin was amazing. Oddly I think my fav part was running my hands through her wet soapy hair. We stayed in the shower somewhere between 30-45 min.

After we turned on Planet Earth and snuggled/rolled/kissed/talked on the couch largely for the rest of the experience.
We went to sleep about six and a half hours after dose. Both she and I reported poor sleep quality and extremely heightened dream states.

After thoughts
Our connection deepened far more because of the joint experience than either of us thought would happen.
It would have been nice to have sex but certainly did not take away from it.
Shower was amazing.
Hangover wasn't to bad. I was just very tired the next day from lack of sleep. 

We both will want to do it again, and frankly I don't think there would have been a better place for she and I to have done it than in our own home. Just the two of us.

I'm all for discussion.  If there's people here that know what's happening *then explain it.* 
It doesn't do anyone any good to just criticize and leave... if there's information to be provided then comment and provide it so that people will know whats going on.


The title was written yesterday and I was working off of the available info I had *at that time*.
The text I quoted (above) was the top comment at that time in the thread I linked it too. (/r/onions) 
So let keep things positive. I wanted to send out a warning to people and it was done with the best intentions.
I'm unaware if FH was *also* hosing onion nodes at the time and if those were also corrupted by the arrest of FH's operator.

1357097542.0,21,self.MDMA,15t0f4,Apple_Cup describes what it feels like to roll.  What's it like for you?,23,2,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/MDMA/comments/15t0f4/apple_cup_describes_what_it_feels_like_to_roll/,"A lot of people want to know what it feels like to roll and I know I certainly did before I first tried MDMA but the factual explanations, while informative and valuable in a clinical sense, don't really come anywhere near capturing the subjective *feel* of it.  So in this thread, I'd like to discuss feelings.

Last night, after our local NYE event, I sat with 8 close friends and we talked about that magic feeling when you actually start to peak and they all really loved my description of the feeling of the roll as it feels for me.  I decided to come here and write that description as a post to r/MDMA to try to share my own subjective experience of that magical feeling, as someone who has rolled numerous times, with everyone who is interested.  As it stands, defining *the* feeling (universal) is probably impossible, because individual aspects of it probably vary between users.  However, I think that if enough of us share descriptions of our own individual experiences with that feeling, we can come closer to a universal idea of it.

It all begins with a gentle warmth all over.  This is when I know my body is starting to take in the mollie.  After this the next things I start to feel are the physical effects of the drug.  I slowly become aware of the ""eye wiggle"" (nystagmus) and I notice that my jaw muscle is a bit overstimulated.  At this point, I chew gum to protect my teeth so I don't grind them to the beat (I have a habit of doing this).  Overall I feel amped, only slightly more intense than having a larger than normal dose of caffeine.  I am alert and wired.  But none of these effects are part of that mythic ""roll"" and they aren't the thing that we refer to when we talk about ""rolling"".

The roll can begin after the minor physical effects of the drug set in but at this point it requires your participation.  You cannot sit static and wait for something to happen to you. This is because the drug has primed your brain to give you manifold the normal quantities of serotonin and dopamine but the mechanisms that trigger these releases in your brain are the same as they are in your normal life and they still require an external trigger in order to function because the drug itself is not a trigger.

So, presuming you have a trigger (your favorite song comes on, your best friends give you a hug, you get a lightshow etc...) what does the infamous ""roll"" actually feel like?  To me, it feels as though my body is a hollow vessel and it starts to fill from my feet with warm energy and emotion.  As it fills up, I feel it rise higher, past my stomach, past my chest, to my neck, and finally it has filled me all the way to my head and I feel a rushing, pressure right behind my eyes.  It's not uncomfortable pressure though, it feels ecstatic, like a fuzzy massage, but it is still pressure and all of that energy and emotion keep rushing in to fill me so I want to let some out and share it with my friends.  I move and dance to expend the energy kinetically, I find a best friend who is coming up too and I hold them tight and tell them I love them to give them my energy, I give a total stranger a compliment and in their smile I see the reflection of the energy I just gave them, I massage a friend's scalp or neck to press my energy into them and because I know that to them, it feels like their nerves are little sparks at the ends of live wires and that my touch is making them feel fireworks of pleasure.  Then I must also expend the emotion, I sing the lyrics to my favorite songs with all my heart and look at the faces of the people around me who are singing too and we share a moment as I sing with them, I yell with joy at the top of my lungs right before the beat drops, sometimes I am so happy that my cheeks are wet with tears, sometimes the music is so beautiful that our knees are weak and, unable to dance, we reach out and lean on each other and we sing, together.  

I believe that many aspects of the roll are unique to the individual, but I also believe that most can relate to the overall sensation of a rushing feeling right behind your eyes, and an energy that you must express.",,False,self,t5_2qwvg,False,,,True,t3_15t0f4,http://www.reddit.com/r/MDMA/comments/15t0f4/apple_cup_describes_what_it_feels_like_to_roll/,

This will be a MAPS-sponsored collaborative study between Los Angeles Biomedical Research Institute at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center and the Stanford University School of Medicine. Social anxiety is prevalent in autistic adults, and often compounds the considerable social challenges faced by autistic adults. The main objective of this study is to collect data on the safety of MDMA-assisted therapy in autistic adults, and to use standard clinical measures to estimate the extent to which MDMA-assisted therapy may reduce social anxiety symptoms in this group. Even though we did attempt to obtain external funding from a private foundation, our letter of intent was rejected. [Please consider donating to help complete this study](http://maps.org/donate).

1361513384.0,21,self.MDMA,190a99,"Does anyone else experience rolling ""flashbacks"" for several days afterwards in response to emotions or music?",24,3,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/MDMA/comments/190a99/does_anyone_else_experience_rolling_flashbacks/,"I rolled for the first time last weekend at a large party at my former college, and it was an incredible experience. Spent the night in a blacklight room with waves of euphoria running up and down my body in tune with the music and lights.

 Since then, I keep experiencing smaller waves in response to certain things. Anything that reminds me of the weekend will induce them - a lot of the posts on this subreddit, for example. Strong emotions, and anything that makes me feel connected to other people, will also induce them.

Some music has also induced it, though not particularly strong, until I listened to this song just a moment ago, and the waves it induced felt almost as strong as if I were still rolling. I was incapable of thinking or moving the whole time I was listening to it, just laying there letting the waves of happiness flow through me. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aKlRWo2u1Y

Does anyone else experience this? It's now been five days since I rolled. Other than feeling extra tired and half-asleep a lot, I haven't had any serious ""coming down"" effects other than these wave flashbacks. If you experience them, how long do they usually go on? I'm quite enjoying them, though sometimes it gets distracting feeling like I'm still rolling in response to simple things. 

EDIT: I should note that the song (Ghost by Neutral Milk Hotel) wasn't even a song I hear while rolling. I have some strong emotional connections with other NMH songs, but not that particular one or related to last weekend. Just something about the sound of that song (and others on the same album to a lesser extent) really triggers feelings of rolling.",,False,self,t5_2qwvg,1361595480.0,,,True,t3_190a99,http://www.reddit.com/r/MDMA/comments/190a99/does_anyone_else_experience_rolling_flashbacks/,

1359606982.0,19,self.MDMA,17m0al,Trip report: my first experience with MDMA.,26,7,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/MDMA/comments/17m0al/trip_report_my_first_experience_with_mdma/,"Trip Report:
Okay, it’s not technically my first time. When I was 18, I took one pill of unknown quantity and contents, purported to be “ecstasy”. I’m 23 now, and haven’t tried it since. I recently came upon a source that I trust to be accurate, safe, and reliable. He sells lab tested, MDMA at a reasonable price. I purchased 2.25 Grams in the form of 10, 225mg pressed pills. (+/- 5 mg). 

8:05 PM: 	I am home, alone for the evening. I cut one of the pills in half. One half splits cleanly, the others explodes into shards and powder. Oops. I ingest the in-tact half tab, marking my initial dose at 110 mg.

8:50 PM: 	I was anxiously awaiting the feeling, and it has arrived. The nerves on my arms and legs are tingling. My arms feel light. I smile to myself, as I begin to feel my apprehension and nervousness turn in to pleasure and introspection. 

9:15 PM	I am in deep thought. This has been the hardest year of my adult life, and I can so clearly see the downfalls and repetitive, negative behavior that has brought me to this point. I realize that the world doesn’t owe me anything. I’ve had a “woe is me” attitude for the last 9 months, and I can see that nobody is going to change my situation but me. Nobody is going to hand me something for nothing. My lack of motivation and amount of laziness I have disgusts me now. People move through setbacks, and successful people continue to fight on their road to success. I feel extremely motivated to “work harder” at getting to where I want to be.

9:40 PM	I decide I want more. I see the crushed and powdered half of a remaining pill, and decide to take this portion nasally after crushing it more finely. (2nd dose, 110 mg).

9:50 PM	I can clearly feel a sudden, immediate rush from my second dose. I’ve never snorted anything in my life, and can’t say why I felt such an urge to do it now. The feeling is nearly immediate, and very intense, I am truly feeling “ecstatic” at this point. I turn on same dance music, and dance around my house feeling great. This track comes on, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugM4jL7qcIk     and I have to listen to it 6 or 7 times. This is seriously an amazing track. My jaw is really starting to clench up bad now, so I put a few sticks of gum in my mouth. MAN oh MAN did that gum feel great.  While the chewing of the gum itself was enjoyable for my jaw, it was the sensation of my tongue manipulating the gum that was so amazing. I don’t know how to describe it. The gum was so soft, so moldable, it was very erotic. I certainly wish I had a female to have experienced this with, every nerve in my body is sensitive to the slightest touch. (more on this later).

10:30 PM	This is where I should have stopped, but I decide to take another half of a pill. Same story, I cut one in half, one half shatters, the other is a clean break. I swallow the clean break half (3rd dose, 110 mg). I’m feeling very cold, I know I’m supposed to be hot and drink lots of fluids, but I’m freezing. I put on a coat. I sit and try to play some video games, but I can’t concentrate on them, and they aren’t enjoyable in the slightest. Concentrating on anything is a little difficult now. I go look in the mirror, and my pupils are enormous, they’ve completely overtaken the colored portion of my eyes.  I laugh at myself, and practice saying a few sentences to see if I sound “all drugged out”. In my eyes anyway, I passed the test just fine. More dancing commences.

11:40 PM	I decide to take my final dose. This dose was definitely overboard, and in fact, I didn’t feel any difference from how I was already feeling. I crush and consume the last half of the pill nasally again (4th dose, 110 mg). 

12:30 AM	I’ve been dancing by myself for almost an hour. I decide to go rest on the bed, the feeling is quite different from that when I’m moving. I close my eyes, and I’m floating, a kaleidoscope of colors, emotions, and thoughts runs through my brain. I reflect back on past lovers, and again reinforce my decision to bring myself out of the slump I’ve drug myself into. Seriously, I see it happening to so many people, and it’s happening to me to. You have to go out and get what you want, life’s too short to sit around waiting. I’ve been sitting around, fucking angry at everybody, when I should have fucking DONE something about my own situation. 

1:30  AM	Definitely coming down a little bit. Still rolling, but much of the “euphoria” has been replaced by irritable eye-wiggles and a headache.
	
2:30 AM	Token masturbation attempt. Unable to reach orgasm. I am infuriatingly horny, which exacerbates everything. 

3:00 AM	I take a swig of Nyquil, and fall asleep relatively easily.

9:00 AM	I wake up for work. Jaw still clenching pretty bad. I can still feel the effects of the mdma. I feel good, I feel wide awake, happy, and refreshed.

1:00 PM	Jaw clenching has finally dissipated, along with my mornings feelings of glee. My right nostril is hurting from where I snorted the mdma, my throat is coarse and soar, and my brain feels a little “fried”. I’m having a hard time concentrating on tasks at work. I feel a little nauseous.

6:00 PM	These feelings subside too, and I’m left with only the burning nostril. 

Final thoughts: 	I had an amazing time. I had some revelations, and felt happier than I have in a long time. That said, I definitely took too much, and I fear that the negative effects weren’t harmful enough to keep me from likely binging on the remaining 8 pills I have over the next few weeks.

I wanted to gather some stats on our subreddit's usage patterns to satisfy personal curiosity. I have a few questions for you guys:

1) how long have you used for?

2) on average, how frequently do you roll? Or On average how long do you wait in between rolls?

3) what is your preferred dosage and your average dosage?

4) do you feel any diminished effects from mdma? Do you use supplements?

I'll share mine and maybe if there is enough data we can create some graphic for it or something

1) started December 2012, last used in June 2013

2) i have used about 10 times in 9 months so my average down time is a bit less than a month; there was a month where i used 4 times though, so my scheduling has been erratic. i am now aware of this community's harm reduction guidelines and hope to only roll twice a year.

3) my preferred dosage is now 100mg but my average dosage is probably near 200, again due to my ignorance. I no longer wish to use more than 100 again

4) i feel that the effects are not as strong but that may be due to the lack of novelty and consistent setting (i have never rolled outside my home). Also I have lowered my preferred dose. I started supplementation for my last few rolls by using guidelines i found on this subreddit. as a result i no longer suffer bad comedowns. I understand that this may be a placebo effect or the result of slowing down my usage. 

I am eager to see other users' experiences! Thank you for your time

I can't believe there aren't more people out there who've done this, but obviously it's my duty to spread the word. 

**TL;DR Spin around, like small children often do, about twenty seconds, then carefully lie down and relax your eyes.** 

So I discovered this my very first time, and it's definitely a staple for us. It came from noticing the fairly-perceptible visual *lag* (couldn't find a scientific term for this) while moving my head/field of vision quickly from one point of reference to another. 

I began entertaining myself with this phenomena, which progressed from nodding my head up and down (especially in time to music this is a lot of fun by itself), to quickly shaking my head (like miming, ""No""), and then I had the epiphany ...

Instructions: 

Clear out a safe space. If you're rolling *ballz*, you'll probably want to have someone watch out for your ass, so you don't crash into something and hurt yourself. 

Spin around in a circle, gently, and with increasing (but never too much; it's unnecessary and you don't want to eat shit doing this) speed. 

Slowly count out loud to twenty. (Can be fun to have someone count for you too.) 

If you're having trouble balancing, it's helpful to look down at your feet, but much more fun to just look out and see the world around you start to blur into something that looks like a very long-exposure camera shot, especially toward the end. 

Start with your arms stretched out, airplane-style, and then on the last three-to-five seconds, bring them in and fold them across your chest to increase your centrifugal force (careful with this). 

Now **stop.** Carefully lie down (even better if you have a soft mattress--grass outside is perfect but this is a bit suspicious-looking to do in a public area). 

You need to relax your eyes, because you're going to have a severe case of post-rotatory nystagmus. Just let them flip back and forth unhindered, and enjoy your thirty seconds-or-so of absolute and dizzy bliss. 

You're welcome. 

Note: This is also good for kicking the roll back in when it's starting to fade (although that effect seems to be pretty transient). ",,False,self,t5_2qwvg,False,,,True,t3_1e54dw,http://www.reddit.com/r/MDMA/comments/1e54dw/for_anyone_rolling_tonight_my_favorite_rolltrick/,

Im sat here wide eyed and wishing I could tell my younger self to treat Mandy and Molly with respect. Its not a drug for getting fucked up on, its a drug to enjoy in measure, like good red wine.

I've rolled three times since then, waiting a month between each of my rolls. I now see how this stuff can be addictive and I'm glad I started out like that. My first time was .2 of relatively weak mdma powder, and my other two times were with purple mdma powder, also .2, which felt much stronger.

I'm here to ask you about my second time, the first time I did the purple mdma. I did it with a few close friends at a house party, just a perfect setting. There's this girl I've been friends with for a few months, and I've always kinda-maybe felt something for her. It was her first time doing MDMA. 

Well at one point in the night we all got one on one to talk. And I talked with her, of stuff she never told me before and made me feel much closer to her. And then we touched and hugged before returning with the other ones.  And the touching... I mean, I understand how powerful touching can be on MDMA, but it was more than anything I'd ever felt, it almost felt like there was actual electricity. And the hugging oh dear god, it feels like it lasted forever. We were lying down in a bed, our faces barely touching. My beard on her silky hair, the warmth... dear god...

Well as you guys can guess, it's been a month now and I think I'm in love. We've talked about that, and she made me understand we'd be nothing more than very close friends. I've always had problem falling out of love with a girl, but those feelings were born under MDMA ? Are they even genuine ? What's your opinion on that ? Have you felt anything similar.

I'm gonna roll with her in a week, I'm scared those feelings might still grow or I might do something that endangers our friendship. I know she'd forgive me, but I don't want to do that.

(ie bruxism when they hear great music while sober),22,5,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/MDMA/comments/1k8kz7/out_of_curiosity_does_anyone_get_placebo_effects/,"Edit - Like I said at the bottom,  its not a high or a roll at all, just the more negative side effects. 

Really out of curiosity only since I've never heard anyone mention anything like this before and couldn't find anything via search.

I've taken MDMA on average once every 2 months since last summer. 

Every time I've rolled has been at show/festival. I still frequently go to shows sober as well, but now I find that when I do, I can't stop grinding my teeth - as bad or worse than I do when I roll. I come home with a jaw so sore I can barely eat the next day, despite going completely sober. 

Then here and there, including today, I was listening to an awesome, emotional mix and getting REALLY into it the music... and I started getting pretty intense eye wiggles and mild visual distortion (like I'm very slightly cross eyed) like I do when I roll on slightly higher doses (150mg, nothing insane). It was bad enough that I had to put on my sunglasses and close my eyes because I was starting to feel motion sick. I couldn't stop them until I turned the music off. 

Even when I haven't rolled in 2 months+, it doesn't seem to improve - it seems to come and go as it pleases.

Does anyone else get anything like this? Is it common? Like I said, just curious :).  It's not *much* of an issue but I'm worried that it may get worse with continued usage.

Me and my friend went solo on a big music festival, both taking for the first time. We planned 130-140 and redose 50-60, bu because some problems we were forced to take both at once. It was around 200 mg, so a solid dose.
50 minutes min my friend feels a headspinn and some weird feeling in his stomach, and 5-10 minutes later jaw clench, so he starts rolling. At first I was just waiting for the same thing, and after 1 hour and 30 minutes still nothing, I was getting really frustrated. 2 hours and 20 minutes pass, I still feel absolutely nothing, and I'm sad and angry. I can't believe I have so bad luck, 200 mg, very hard dose for the first time, and I don't feel anything at all.

Anyway, we go to a different stage (Jeff Mills) to meet up with a friend of my friend, he took MDMA several times before. He asked me how much i took, gave me a tiny beet of an E pill, about one third, and told me just to forget the frustration, close my eyes and let the roll come. 

And then, out of nowhere, about 15-20 minutes later, I just herd some slight change in music, opened my eyes and there was robot women dancing on stage (it was no trip, it really was there :D). Light shimmered on her costume, and I had no idea what changed in the next two minutes, but I just had the biggest desire to dance, and BUM I was rolling my face off. Any touch felt great, hugs felt amazing, I was very talkative, and most of all happy, just happy. MDMA happiness was mixed with the feeling of the relief of finally rolling and knowing that my night isn't ruined. After all, I wouldn't change anything...

We were rolling for 6,5 hours straight, untill 8AM. I just came home, and for some reason I still have so much energy, I'm still bobbing my head to the beat of the music. I'm not rolling any more, but I am just not tired for now, we'll see...

I guess normally before taking a risk to open up with someone that much you might sort of come to terms with the fact that it's scary and dangerous and risky beforehand and you feel the pain of the risk, then after you do it, you would feel scared but I guess you would have counted the risk or come to terms with it so you know after you take the risk it's going to be scary and weird waiting for the person's reaction (or second and third reaction after they think about what you've told them). On MDMA it feels like I took the risk while I was anesthetized and so now afterwards I feel bad about it, I'm scared and not sure I should have said that much.

I met a kid right when I walked in, he asks me what we're supposed to do here. ""Do whatever feels right! Just dance and have a good time!"" He tells me its his first rave, his friends brought him.  I see a few friends and trade kandi... Go to the second room/stage and have a fun time shuffling with other friends. Newbie raver Matt sees me again and I'm wearing earplugs and can't understand when he asks if he can dance with me, so he types it out on his phone, aww! He and I team up and I give him some kandi. He kept all the creeps away from me by acting as my boyfriend. He is beyond impressed with my only slightly-impressive dance moves. His smile doesn't fade all night.

I excuse myself to take my pills in the portipotties out back. Fourty-five minutes later I'm listening to some amazing prog. house/complextro and my vision gets blurry, I can tell my pupils are dialating and trying to re-focus. I take my earplugs out when the next DJ comes on. My favorite genre, hardstyle, is coursing through my whole body, up from the dirty floor into my legs and my heart and my eyes... I close my eyes and revel in a moment, it felt like time stretched on as the peak grew higher and higher... 

I felt a bit sick, this happened last time I took this particular molly. I got a strong reflex in my throat to throw up. I gagged a bit and spit on the floor. No throwing up again, I decided, and the feeling passed. Matt was sober but knew that I must have taken something. He rubbed my head, hugged me, and kept me in a nice head space. I was dancing my ass off and became a bit overwhelmed so we sat against the wall in the back of the room with other people. Traded more kandi with people we were sitting by... Just being able to sit and cuddle and talk to a new friend and listen to this amazing music... It was the best. 

We spent the rest of the night dancing, getting light shows, and I traded all most all of the kandi I brought with me away. I kept running into people I had met at previous events... I love this big rave family I've sort of entered into. It was amazing to get down in that last half hour of the rave... DJs are dropping their favorite last tracks, everyone is running on pure endorphins and dancing but you can tell everyone's winding down... but 4 am has to come and it comes time to part ways. Hug and say your goodbyes and hellos, leave the venue with a giant, abeit painful smile on your face. 

I started raving in October and I've managed to make it to atleast one rave a month since then. I've never been happier, so content with my life. The feelings I get when I'm dancing and lock eyes with someone and they smile and I smile back... That profound connection is something I wish everyone could experience at least once. Sober or not, raves are a place where I feel totally at home and my entire well being is satisfied. 

The afterglow I experience from MDMA is something that I've come to love and look forward to. I've been blessed to never have a bad come down off of MDMA. I can look back in reflection and take all of the experience in. My outlook is very positive the week following. Just thinking about the vibes and the music and the people... Such a positive space. I can't wait to go ""home"" again soon.

Not that we fight a lot, or that we roll when we have problems but sometimes when we bicker about petty things we know its rooted somewhere else but its unsaid. We dont roll that often because were aware it can be a problem but when we decide to roll it gives us the perfect oppurtunity to be completely honest and open with each other. We really talk about the root of the problem without arguing and it always helps us understand each other even more! Its opened our communication and taken down emotional walls we've unknowingly set up. Then were smitten with each other for months, haha!

we spend most of the day walking around, seeing bands, drinking free rockstars.. The usual gig for anyone who knows the show. It was overcast all day, so it stayed nice and cool, around 80 with no sun, absolutely perfect. it got to be later and they opened up the main stage/lawn area. We're sitting in the lawn, listening to mastadon, bullshitting and just having a great day. 

We decided to head over to the bathrooms and fill our water bottles at the fountain. On our way we ended up running into an old friend from school and he informed me he had great molly caps at 10 bucks a piece. I was hesitant at first, never tried it and never planned on it. I got his number in case one of them wanted to get one, and went back to our spot in the lawn. I pull out my phone and start researching what  molly would be like. After reading way too much contradicting information I gave up on it, called my buddy and asked him if he could come sit with us.


I asked him if it would make me hallucinate(I'm absolutely horrified of the thought). He informed me I would be in complete control of myself and my actions and at most I would see some tracers/bright colors. I was still unsure, I've had many bad trips with weed which is why I don't smoke anymore. A few friends decided to buy a few caps, and I joined in saying ""fuck it"". He told us to crack them open and let them dissolve on our tongue. We each bought three .1g caps.

We waited until the band before Five Finger Death Punch ended(can't remember who it was). We each opened our caps and dumped them in our mouths. It was seriously the most discussing thing I've ever tasted(And I used to snort heroin every day for 2+ years!).. We took it like champs though, and continued talking and enjoying ourselves. of the 4 of us, none had ever tried it. The dude who sold it to us told us .3g would be a really good roll. I was really anxious for it to kick in, almost scared of what was to come. Though they hadn't said anything about it, I could tell they were all excited for it to kick in.

It's been about 30 minutes and five finger death punch comes on stage and starts playing their song Salvation. We all stand up and start cheering, and almost instantaneously we all looked at each other with the biggest shit eating grins obviously implying we had started to feel it. I feel a warm pulse pouring through my body, colors are starting to become the most amazing things ever. The music is heavenly. I notice the smallest things, fireflies and the wind against trees. Everything is absolutely gorgeous. Five finger went through their set list and we all got bummed out when they got off stage. But we're rolling pretty hard right now. We sat back down, 2 of my friends are sitting a few feet away talking, me and another one of them are laying down touching the fuck out of the grass.

A few girls walked up to us and asked if we were rolling, my buddy said yes we were. They just giggled and asked if we wanted to play with their hair. Kind of suspicious, but we said sure. They sat down in front of us and put their hair down. We both started running our fingers through their hair and nearly pissed ourselves with laughter of how amazing it felt. It was so smooth and silky. We sat and did that for a good 20 minutes before the lights went down and music started playing. We stand up and Rob Zombie takes the stage with his enormous LCD screens flashing colors and weird images. I realize that I was peaking super hard, I could barely contain my excitement for seeing Rob Zombie live again! I was burning through cigarettes faster than a hummer burns gas. I'm sweating like hell and I've never felt so alive in my life. I was so full of energy and every emotion I had was easily 10x more intense.

After a good hour and a half of Rob playing his music he leaves the stage and we all start rushing to the car. I'm still rolling, but not nearly intense. I can tell it's starting to wear off. I was told I would start to feel kind of depressed, but I was as chipper as ever. After a long car ride home it was obvious that I was done with my trip. We went in my apartment, watched some tv and ate some Chinese food. I felt completely fine, 100% happy with how the night turned out.

Friday night I went out with my best friend (let's call her Grace). We met at university and lived together, partied pretty hard (drinking) and so on. After uni we each moved home (me - Manchester UK, her - Yorkshire UK). So I see her every few weeks, but we pretty much only go out for drinks.

I might be rambling a bit but I feel like this is important. My boyfriend has been introducing me to new experiences, done MDMA a few times (like once every 1-2 months) and I've even tried acid once. I just felt deep  down that Grace would not approve of this. She seems so self assured that she doesn't even ""need"" drugs - you may have encountered this attitude before.

Anyway, we have an amazing night drinking on Friday and she stays over at mine. The next day my parents go out at about midday, and my boyfriend suggests that me, him, and a few of our friends have a pill and hang out in my house that evening. Now, I seriously considered asking Grace to join us, but she implied she had other plans at home. I did get the feeling that if I had asked, I could've convinced her to stay... but anyway, she went.

Anyway, later that night I'd come up, and I couldn't stop thinking about her. I sent her a big long text admitting that I had wanted to ask her to stay, and that I felt like we'd have a lot to talk about and all this.

She rang me after a while, and even though she knew I was ""on something"" she just started pouring her heart out to me, straight away. She's not managed to get a job since we left uni (nearly two years ago now - I work as a writer which is amazing) and her boyfriend lives in Birmingham (my boyfriend lives down the road from me).

Instead of talking to my confident friend (hair extensions, false eyelashes, lipstick, nice dresses, chats to everyone) I was just talking to this scared girl who had nobody to talk to.

I just couldn't believe that I'd never really ASKED her how she was doing - not just what she'd been up to. She was on the verge of tears at least two times during our conversation. It was like she'd just been waiting for SOMEBODY to take concern in what was actually going on in her head.

It was just so emotional, and I said that next time we get hold of some pills I will definitely ask her in advance so she can decide and get down here etc. But I think she just needed me to care.

Also, all of my friends (who have only ever seen her once and said a few sentences) were coming into my room and asking to talk to her. They knew that she needed people to be genuinely concerned about her. They kept taking the phone off me and just saying ""Grace, are you OK?"" and I think she saw how MDMA actually makes people.

We really broke ground last night and I can't believe that I knew so little about my ""best friend"".

She's starting a teaching position/course in September so she's just got to tide herself over until then. I think she did just have to tell somebody how she'd actually been feeling. So although she was talking about her sadness, we both knew that things are going to get so much better for her from now on...

So ANYWAY! I think sad people should talk to people on MDMA, whether they are actually on anything or not. We really actually listen and ask the right questions when we're influenced by the drug.

Well, rather to the serotonin-related effects, I still get the stimulant effects.

To give an example, last time I took MDMA. Reagent-tested as MDA/MDMA, crystals, definitely high purity. Did it with some friends. They started their roll off with ~200mg each because they wanted a strong roll, I started with ~300mg. By the time it kicks in they're all rolling hard, I'm clearly feeling the stimulant effects but the ""happy"" just isn't quite there, I'm feeling it but not like them, they're clearly off their faces but I feel more like I'm a bit happier than normal but mostly like I've done a couple of bumps of amphetamine. In the past I've experimented with starting with as much as 500mg, at that point I seem to be able to get that almost delirious joy that others get at 200-250mg but the body load is pretty intense starting off at those doses…

Now, I don't have any known issues like depression or such, I'm a pretty regular guy mood-wise, not on any medications, except for the odd bong hit or a few beers I don't use drugs more than 3-4 times per year, this weird tolerance issue has been with me since the first time I tried MDMA, a bit taller than average and in pretty good shape. Also, I can't say I have any similar tolerance issues with other substances.

So, are there any tricks for dealing with this tolerance? I'd love to be able to be as high as my friends without having to take ridiculously high doses.",,False,self,t5_2qwvg,False,,,True,t3_16y09w,http://www.reddit.com/r/MDMA/comments/16y09w/ways_to_deal_with_high_natural_tolerance/,

I've never done any other drugs at all and dont like to smoke, but I figured since I love EDM so much that if I were ever to try something like this, Ultra would be where it happened.  I actually tried some of what im guessing was mostly bunk stuff on saturday and didnt feel much.  Sunday though, I rolled my face off from a different source.   It was amazing.  I was with a group of ravers and a couple friends that did the same and we went to major lazer, above and beyond, and armin.  The entire experience was like nothing i'd felt before.  I started to come down during alleso and through SHM and ended up ""chasing the dragon"" with friends in south beach till 3-4 AM.  I didnt have any negative side affects the following days, but possibly felt like I had an afterglow for a day or two.

Over the past week, I've been reading up a lot about MDMA and how to be safe and how best to use it.  So here are my questions so far...

1. From my reading, it looks like you should wait 90 days between doses for the best rolls.  What about dosing multiple times/days once you've done the wait?  I.e. if i go to another festival like ultra or tommorowworld and want to dose each day, is that ok?  Will the rolls be the same each time (assuming similar quality)?

2. Vitamin C;  I've seen some people on here look down on double dosing after 2-3 hours, I'f I'm looking for a longer roll, how effective is drinking OJ or taking vitamin C tablets?  when should I be taking them?

3.  As I've said, I've never done any other drugs before so do not know the scene or how to be smart about it.  How do I go about finding a safe source as a smart user?  I have read up on testing and will be sure to be using those methods but first I need to find a sample.  Any advice?

I appreciate any tips or pieces of advice any of you care to pass along! :)

This cycle continues usually about 4-5-6 times until the comedown fully takes over.

The feeling usually cheers up a bit because you stabalize, but the initial contrast between the up and the down sure is horrible.

It was a life changing experience, but I was left very very CONFUSED. I would also like to note that I only did it with one person, who was a girl that i had a crush. I actually barely knew anything about molly, but she brought it up a lot. She told me about how it ""make's you feel complete"", and how it is 100x better than weed. So of course i was interested! We managed to get our hands on 1g of molly and thus the night started.

At around 9 we were informed by our dealer that he actually gave us 1.1g. So we eyeballed it into 6 piles and poured 2 into a water bottle. I trusted her, because she's done it multiple times before. We then split the bottle into two cups and drank. 25 minutes later, i felt something i never felt before. We turned up Knife Party and danced and danced and danced. It was amazing and very euphoric. Suddenly she kisses me and i can't resist. We make out and end up on the bed. We start sharing things about ourselves that are very personal. I tell her things that my best friends don't even know about. I felt like i had the world. We drink water and play around with ice. All this lasted around maybe an hour and she asks me to go dancing again. I try, but maybe around 10 minutes later, i get tired again and tug her back onto the bed. She says she can feel it coming down and wants me to re-dose. Only 2 hours had passed. I still felt very happy, but not as energetic so I just went along with it. We drink down another 2 piles and turn up the music.

It hits me again, and i dance and dance, but i tired down again and we end up in the bed. I felt so intimate and happy and at peace with the world, so i just close my eyes. We continue to share secrets and we make out so passionately. I never felt so confident and amazing. I tease her and talk to her as if I'd been dating her. I ask her to be my girlfriend for the night and she quickly says yes. We talk about the honeymoon period and how fucking great it feels, especially right now. We kiss and she's on top of me. We are in our boxers and i end up touching her down there. I ask if i can go down on her and she says no. It does'nt bother me at all. I ask her if she can be my real girlfriend when we sober up and we make multiple promises. 1.Not to be awkward when we sober up in the morning 2. To go on a date together 3. to never share the secrets we told each other. She then tells me that she's falling for me. We share more things and she tells me that i could be the most humble friend ever. We cry together, but it felt right. I tell her we should get to know each other perfect and she agrees. She compliments me on everything, and i do the same too. We continue to drink water and occasionally stand up to dance for a few minutes. We also went out to pee quite a few times. This lasts until 1- ish.


She says shes starting to comedown again and asks to take the remaining 2 piles. She also said that she heard smoking weed was a good mix with it. So we down the last 2 piles in water and go out for a quick hit with a waterfall bong. We come back and suddenly the world turns around crazy. We were the only ones in the room together, and suddenly i start feeling the presence of other people. I tell her to come on the bed with me to comfort me. We kiss a few more times, but somethings not right. Her face starts morphing into animals and monsters. And she tells me the same thing is happening to my face. She  leaves me for my computer and i stay on the bed. I start hearing things and the world is spinning and im queezy. She's very quiet and i notice her looking at me glaring with burning hatred in her eyes. Im scared shitless. At the same time I can hear all these hallucinations talking to each other as if i wasn't even there. She goes out to pee again and I scream and I hit the metal frame of my bed really hard. After a few hours in which time felt just wrong... i manage to stand up and move to the computer. I look at her in the eyes and shes wearing glasses even though she doesn't wear them. And shes also crying. Suddenly its fucking 6 in the morning and i realize im watching a 9/11 video, bawling for the first time in years while shes next to me too. We listen to sad sad lovey dovey songs and i constantly ask if shes crying. She always replys with no.

We calm down around 8-ish and she's on the bed with me again. We didn't sleep at all but i felt like i was in a trance of some sort. I wake up from it and give her the most dry horrid peck on the lips. I feel like shit.  We go out for a walk, and it's the most awkward silent walk ever. I can barely make out sentences. We end up going back to our rooms and i pass out and wake up at 5. 

The following days i felt very moody. A few hours after i woke up i went out to dance and i felt great. I went back home and immediately felt like shit. This cycle is still going on. I feel empty and useless at certain points but happy and hopeful at others. I constantly think back to what happened that night and I especially the intimacy between me and her. I read up online that .2g is not the normal dosage and realize that we fucked up big time. Whats really bothering me is the feeling that i felt ""love"" and that it was just ripped away from me. I keep on thinking whether or not she feels the same. im just a mess. I don't even know.

I'm pretty sure we fucked up on multiple multiple things. I also want to know your opinions on molly and love. I feel very lost in terms of my emotions right now. I also don't know how she feels.

We each were planning on taking 2 skittles at first and then take one more when we get home. We've done it once in the past. It was so much fun last time because it's interesting what fun can be had at home with a good friend in a more intimate setting. Btw we had these once before and they tested amazing.

 These guys took about a full hour and a half to kick in, it was weird. They were very strong and they worked just as well as the last time, but, here is where it gets interesting. After the rave i had already come down from those and i was ok to drive of course. When we got back it had already been about 7 hours since i took my last, so we both decided to take one each right away. We smoked a bowl (which always enhances it) and waited for a little. All of a sudden, it crept up pretty fast and i was feeling good, then after 30 or so minutes, i peaked for about 4 hours straight! i kid you not. Me and my buddy did light shows to some AMAZING prog house for about an hour! It seemed like everything was in slow motion but time was going by pretty fast in a way. Music moved through my body and soul. It was.... SO GOOD! I dont know if you guys feel the same way but this always happens haha. Anyway, music was so incredible to my ears i couldn't even explain. It was just so amazing. At one point I even told my friend, how is it even possible to feel this good! I was probably at a 10/10 for about 3 hours straight... If you guys have similar stories, i want to hear them :)

So i just wanted to share this short little story with you guys.. it was so incredible. i hope im not the only one who gets to feel this way when i take it.

This substance fizzed bright yellow for less than a minute then turned bright orange for the rest of the reaction (and stayed that color). 
I am having a difficult time reading these results with any reasonable certainty. On the ""Erowid's Ecstasy Testing Kit FAQ"" Marquis Reaction Chart page http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/mdma/mdma_faq_testing_kits.shtml it says that 5-MeO-DiPT has the exact reaction I observed (""fizzes then turns yellow quickly changing to a slightly rusty orange""), BUT when I click on any5-MeO-DiPT result on EcstasyData.org, their Marquis Reagent results tend to say ""no reaction"".  I have not found any submission on there yet that had ""yellow to orange"" or ""orange"" Marquis results that I saw...

SO I went back to Erowid's Marquis Chart (linked above) and based on that alone, I narrowed it down to possibly being one of these:
3C-P because it turns ""Orange"" *but isn't 3C-P very uncommon?*
TMA-6 because it goes from ""Yellow to Orange""

But how seriously likely would either of these be in NYC being called molly?

Anyway, based on these results and the substance itself, which is a granulated looking off-white almost yellowish powder, what do you think it most likely is?

Just a note: 
I have used this exact reagent before and had pure sugar turn from yellow to brown as expected; MDMA turn from purple to black; and sodium chloride fizz with no color change as expected- so I do trust my reagent.

Also:
The Marquis Reagent chart on its Wikipedia page doesn't have any entry that looks like my reaction. Erowid's has my exact reaction, but EcstasyData contradicts it...Any advice for other Marquis Reagent charts out there?

tl;dr
NYC, was told it was molly/MDMA
they're capsules of granulated off-white almost yellowish powder
Marquis test: fizzed yellow then turned quickly to orange (and stayed orange)
Erowid's: says 5-MeO-DiPT; BUT EcstasyData: contradicts that...

I have wanted to try MDMA / Ecstasy for ages. This past year has opened doors to new opportunities and MDMA was one of them. I met a girl, Mea, whom I knew had experience with it and asked her if she would get me some and roll with me. This was almost a year ago. She tried, I tried, and finally a year later she got some pure MDMA for me. We decided to go out of town to small hippy town on a Tuesday night of all nights.

Mea and I didn’t know each other that well so this was kind of awkward at first because we both were putting a lot of blind trust in one another as we embarked on this Journey. Here is a little glimpse of how different we are. I wore a plain yet professional shirt matching hat and jeans. Mea wore her hair back with a orange flower in it. She wore a puffy vest, white glasses with no lenses, a dress flower child summer dress with tie died tights underneath and rubber boots. We were an odd couple but a good odd couple that intrigued everyone around us. 

Mea had done MDMA lots and so she knew what to expect. I on the other hand had no Idea what to expect. We went to a bar and took the first dose. We then proceeded to walk the town strip meeting random strangers like Richard, who rode a bike and drank Pabst, and Janice, who approached Mea and told her she was a queen. We decided to go into a karaoke bar. At this point Mea asked how I was feeling. I didn’t feel much and said I felt a little. Mea thought I had been expecting too much out of MDMA and what I was feeling was it. This bummed me out big time because what I was feeling was nothing like what I had read about.
We found a big cushy couch at the karaoke bar and took and seat and ordered some drinks while waited for Mea’s song. This is when I started having fun. We were snuggling on the couch and listening to crappy karaoke but it was all good. We stayed there for an hour talking to people then we decided to head back to the hotel and go in the hot tub.

Before going down to the hot tub we took another dose and smoked a bowl this set the mood just right. We grabbed a couple of beers and took them down to the front desk to get a bottle opener. The front desk guy was very quirky and noticing we were in our pool garb told us we couldn’t take our beers in the pool area. We took the beer to the pool area but left them to the side so we weren’t drinking in the pool.

We got inside the normal Jacuzzi and I entered the closest thing to heaven that I have ever experienced. I was holding Mea in the water and we were looking into each other’s eyes. Steam rose up around her head and she wore a small flower in her hair. She looked like an angel, beauty that is beyond human expression. I was in heaven and Mea was my angel. We were falling in love that night even if it was only for one night. We jumped in the pool at one point, which should have felt cold, but it didn’t. Maybe it did but cold was not a bad feeling just an alternate sensation to experience. We warmed up in the Jacuzzi again than headed back to our room.

When we got back to the room I was still in heaven. Mea drew a bath and we both got naked and got in. We washed each other and massaged each other. At this point if we would not have been on MDMA we probably would have quickly proceeded to sex but we didn’t. Sex wasn’t what either of us wanted to do we just cuddled and played in the bath until the water cooled and it was time to get out. 

My Angel then told me to lie down on the bed and she pulled out some baby powder and poured it all over my body and started massaging me. The powder worked like oil but not as messy. It was an amazing sensation. I then proceeded to give her the same powder massage only I also went down on her. She smelled and tasted amazing and I got lost in how long I spent pleasuring her. After this the effects started to ware off. It was 3 – 4am and we were starting to feel tired. We cuddled up next to each other and fell asleep.

This morning on waking up I felt great. Tired but not down or hung over. Things were a little strange between Mea and I in the morning. How do you experience something so monumental and life changing with a stranger in such a short time? What do you do with that?

I don’t know what to do and who knows what the future might hold. Mea and I are completely different people from completely different worlds. Most likely we will stay friends but that’s it. But I will never forget her because for one night she was my angel and the love of my life.

I took her to the train station and she headed home while I headed back to the business world.

1375650323.0,15,self.MDMA,1jp6ze,"PLEASE READ if you are planning to try, or currently use MDMA... Our friend had a seizure last night after taking ~210mg over 3 hours",27,12,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/MDMA/comments/1jp6ze/please_read_if_you_are_planning_to_try_or/,"Hi,

I am an experienced MDMA user (~12-14 uses), and was at HARD Summer in Los Angeles, CA last night. My brother's friend was a first time user and took ~70mg of molly at 5:30pm, 7pm, and 8pm. He began to feel nauseous around 9:30-10pm and vomited several times over the course of the next hour. We attributed this to overheating and sunstroke, as we had been outside in the sun all day and he might not have had enough water.

We sat down on a hill in the shade, began to drink water, and by 11pm he was feeling better. Everything seemed fine when the show ended at midnight, and we began to take public transportation home. Throughout this period he continued to drink a significant amount of water. At approximately 1am on a city bus he had an intense seizure, stopped breathing, turned blue, and began bleeding from biting his tongue. Honest to god, this was one of the scariest things I have ever seen.

We called 911, and pulled him out onto the side walk to lie him down. He had started breathing at this point, but was still completely rigid, and unconscious, with intense lock-jaw. Multiple police cars, fire trucks, and an ambulance came to rush him to the hospital.

At the hospital, he regained consciousness and was actually talking coherently with a nurse, but relapsed into another seizure around 2:15am... It has been over 12 hours since his first incident and he is still in the hospital loopy on anti-seizure medication. We were in the ER from 1:30-6am this morning, this has been an absolute nightmare, and we just hope that he's ok. Telling our parents and his parents what is going on has been extremely difficult.

What caused the seizures is still TBD. Was it the drug itself? Did he drink too much water and dilute his electrolytes? Something else? We just don't know... He may be completely fine, or might have reoccurring seizures for the rest of his life. Our drugs were purchased from a very reputable seller on the Silk Road, so it is unlikely that a contaminant is responsible... this was pure MDMA.

If you are planning to use MDMA, please please please consider the risks of this drug. There are both direct and indirect dangers, the substance is not as safe as many would have you believe.

If someone becomes nauseous, get them immediate medical attention. 

Be very careful not to overcompensate when drinking water. It is unwise to pound water just because you think you are supposed to... drink regularly, but not excessively.

Finally, do not initiate others without making sure that they completely understand the associated risks.

Please stay safe.


**Edit 1:** So, we just visited him in the hospital and met his parents there. He's in the ICU, which is some pretty serious shit. He is super drowsy, but we were able to tell him about why happened last night. The cause of the seizures has been identified as drinking too much water, not bad drugs (confirmed as MDMA through hospital toxicology reports). This results in an unsafe drop in electrolyte concentrations, nausea, seizures, and death if untreated. He drank a lot of water, but not an outrageous amount (It's not like be was killing gallon jugs). Obviously the toxic amount of water varies per person... please don't find out the hard way. This would probably never have happened if we stayed out of the sun more during the day, or took him to a medical tent as soon as he started vomiting.


**Edit 2:** He was released from the hospital this afternoon. His tongue is swollen from where he clamped down on it during his seizures, but other than that, he seems to be his old self. I can't overstate how much of a train wreck this weekend was. Seizures are scary as fuck, waiting 5.5 hours in the ER hoping your friend isn't dead is scary as fuck, calling your parents at 4:30am to ask them what to do is scary as fuck, meeting your friend's parents in the ICU and telling them how their only child ended up there is scary as fuck. You get the idea... You really don't want to have to deal with this. Not to mention the medical bills... His parents have health insurance, but this is still going to cost a small fortune.


If there is one take away from this experience, it's that if someone is not feeling well, take them to a medical tent immediately. The staff there know how to handle all possible scenarios. Be honest with them about what is going on (and what the person is on)... that could be the difference between someone being fine or having multiple seizures and nearly dying.",,False,self,t5_2qwvg,1375770805.0,,,True,t3_1jp6ze,http://www.reddit.com/r/MDMA/comments/1jp6ze/please_read_if_you_are_planning_to_try_or/,

SWIM went to a rave this last weekend with a few friends. He rolled successfully more than 10 times before, so the side effects and comedowns are pretty familiar (different batches, different rolls and different comedowns - but they were all pretty consistent).




This weekend SWIM and a friend dosed 2 points, and then a 2-3 points redosing during the first hour of the roll. The comeup started at around 8am, and the roll (altough quite mellow) went on for about 15 (FIFTEEN!) hours. about halfway through the roll they each got home, but it just kept on going. completely dilated pupils, vivid colours, jaw-clenching, and this constant need to talk, dance and move. the comedown only started at around 11pm. SWIM only fell asleep at around 4am, and woke up after about 4-5 hours of sleep. The familiar hangover has yet to come (36h since dose), the jaws are still clenching (mildly), along with some short term memory loss and inability to concentrate.




the molly was tested positive for MDxx but SWIM's hunch tells him it was maybe cut with something. Reddit, would you please help me figure this out.

1369978021.0,15,self.MDMA,1fdzqe,Wonderful first time taking MDMA - overall liked it better than LSD or Mushrooms.,16,1,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/MDMA/comments/1fdzqe/wonderful_first_time_taking_mdma_overall_liked_it/,"Yesterday at about 4:20 pm I did ecstasy. Well kind of, I really did MDMA or ""Molly"", but I'm not one hundred percent sure what the difference is (or what it might have been cut with). Was really worried about it being cut with other more harmful drugs, but it was absolutely amazing, and I 'm pretty sure this stuff was pure after everything that's happened. Best drug experience of my life so far. Where do I start with this drug? I'm so excited and happy just thinking about yesterday. I dissolved the molly in a glass of water and drank it. It took about thirty minutes to start feeling it, and at first my chest just felt really warm and tingly. And that feeling began to radiate through my arms and legs. As time went on the tingling feeling grew until it encompassed my entire body. That's probably about the time my desire to hug everything began. I hugged all of my friends over and over, and when I wasn't hugging them it was usually either a pillow or a kitten (kitten fur is the softest thing on Earth by the way). I told all of my friends there how much they mean to me and how much I love them. I even called a few friends while they were at work just to tell them. After that I listened to some Gorillaz Plastic Beach, and when it got to the song Empire Ants I was in pure ecstasy. The feeling was indescribable. Happy all over. Every part of me felt good, that is to say, there was no bad left in me, or in the world. I gained a sudden appreciation for all kinds of things, and a wonderful love for everything alive. I gained not only a healthy respect for my own life but also a love for my life. Something I have struggled to do lately. Before I took this I was planning it out, but at this point it didn't matter to me what I did, because I felt incredible. I didn't actually see any visual hallucinations, everything did look awesome though, but just because everything felt awesome. I was comfortable anywhere and up for doing anything. A friend offered to drive me to a park with a walking trail that had waterfalls and really pretty nature. While I waited for everyone to get ready, I sat on their front porch and smoked a cigarette. Maybe the best one I've ever smoked (I would say second best to the ones I've smoked on shrooms). On the way to the park we listened to a few tracks from Daft Punk's new album (Giorgio by Moroder, Touch, and Doin' it right). They were all fucking incredible. When we got to the park, my high had actually declined a bit, but I was still feeling great. It was different now in the sense it felt more peaceful. The sound of the waterfall at that park became the most calming sound ever. We walked the trail a bit, and saw about five deer grazing in a field. We got to walk right by them and they didn't even run away. We saw the sunset while lying in the grass on a beautiful hill. Shortly after we headed home. I went to bed about an one hour later, then slept for about eleven more. Didn't have much of a come down at all, which I am thankful for (coming down from acid was a bit more rough). My body just felt tired, and I had a little trouble getting to sleep, but I was still in a great mood so I didn't care. A whole lot of weed didn't hurt either. I feel like this experience helped me get to know myself better. It has swayed my entire outlook on life, love, and commitment. I plan to live my life slightly different with the realizations this drug helped me to come to. I look forward to doing it again soon (but not often, I know it can be dangerous). Just remember, when you are experimenting with a new drug, don't just be focused on how it makes you feel, or what it makes you see. You also need to focus on how it makes you think. Different drugs can change your thought process and some make you realize things you never would have sober or otherwise. I would recommend this to anyone who is considering it.

Now I'm fine after 13 hours of unconsciousness, lol.)*

To make a **very** long story short, I have bipolar disorder. I had a psychotic break in August 2011 and had to be hospitalised for three weeks. After more or less a year and a half under meds and psychotherapy, I feel better than ever. I've been in dark places but now I know I'm not.

I read a lot about MDMA before trying it, because I'm on Depakote and Seroquel (the latter worried me the most, I take 100 mg a day). However, I wagered the pros and the cons and I decided to give it a shot at my ex-boyfriend's [who will *always* be my friend, I've known this before mdma] house, in a safe and quiet environment rather than at a party.

*(In all honesty I can't give you the technical details of what I tried, but it was a green apple, and the test results were black.)* After taking the first half at around Saturday at 4.20 am (*cough*blaze it*cough*), I didn't feel much for the first hour. At 5.30 I took the other half. As soon as I said ""I'm not feeling mu-"" **BAM**. My jaw starts shaking uncontrollably, and I FEEL IT. An explosion of love inside my chest and my brain, almost impossible to describe. A warm feeling of love, of wanting others to be happy and feel love as well, of wanting to cut the bullshit and simply embrace this weird experience we call ""life "". I talked on and on with my ex about our break-up, our lives, our desire to improve them. The empathy we experienced was mindblowing. We started listening to songs like Under Pressure or Tender... and now I understand the lyrics. I understand many things now. I just want to get rid of negativity and try to find as much peace and love as possible, and not through (only) chemicals. 

I haven't told my mother, but today she told me ""You look very happy, got any good news?"". 

Not really, mum. I just found out how much I like to live.

Edit: the only thing I don't appreciate is the way my whole mouth still hurts. I chewed gum and kept myself properly hydrated, but still. Ouch. Next time I'll do a proper pre- and post-load.

-  a hole in the floor just behind me, it disbalances me, closer investigation turns out that the floor is instead completely intact and I wont get 'bothered' by it for the next 5 minutes or so.
-  When there are people standing in a circle, I tend to see a table in the middle, when I walk over to try and put my beverage on it, I try to suspend my drink in mid-air. 
Kind of the same thing is that I tend to see pillars and try to lean against them, other people seem to think this is hilarious.

-  People faceswapping, I see people/friends that are not there, these are always people I kind of like and when I go up to talk to them, it turns out it is just a random person.

I seem to be hallucinating harder when there is a lot of darkness combined with bright strobes and lazers and such. It's also fun that they are never scary, and they just make me laugh as soon as I find out it was the drugs playing games with me.

1371484528.0,11,self.MDMA,1gis4t,I didn't educate myself appropriately and overdosed on MDMA. This is what I experienced as a result. (Warning; looong wall of text - yes I've used paragraphs),15,4,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/MDMA/comments/1gis4t/i_didnt_educate_myself_appropriately_and/,"**Edit: Clarity**

First three paragraphs below this one are some background, if you want to scroll down to what I experienced after taking **6 times** the amount of a recommended dose - feel free to do so. I took this drug without doing proper research, without testing, and based on the following symptoms, some of you with a stronger knowledge may find that either it wasn't MDMA or, it was cut with something that gave me those particular reactions.

I guess this is more an anecdote for first time users, I don't have a question or anything. My boyfriend was with me from about 3 hours after I took the tablets and stayed the night. Even more stupidly, it was a Wednesday night. I had work in the morning - though I thought I'd be OK after taking a pill at 7pm, surely it will have worn off by morning, right? I'm a legal assistant at a large, international professional services firm that I won't mention the name of. I assist on a lot Australian Commonwealth and State Government / Public Sector work as opposed to Private Sector work which is handled by the other half of the team - I can't afford to not be able to pay attention.

My boyfriend (27) doesn't know I (23) occasionally use - recreational drug use is something we disagree on as he's only seen them destroy the lives of some of his friends and his cousin - doesn't believe they can be used safely in any capacity. He says he saw an awful change in their personalities and behaviours within a week from one pill. I think this was a result of a bad buy and not knowing what their product was cut with or how much to dose. His friends he said turned into total dickheads, his cousin threatened his aunt and uncle and niece with a hammer and then murdered my bf's and his family's cat. I've been told that before the drug he took, he was intelligent, kind, conscientious, and developed a total rage-filled psychosis after getting involved with drugs.

I believe everything can be used responsibly - though yes I understand entirely that I was not responsible in this recent situation and I take full responsibility and acceptance of what happened next because of the uninformed and unthinking decision I made to take too much of something I was unfamiliar with. I occasionally take my health and my life for granted, what with the invincibility of youth and all.

I tried MDMA for the first time off SR about 2 weeks ago. The pills were 220mg each. I took one, and after about an hour I felt my heart rate increase a little, then go back to normal. I felt a little more cheerful, but not huge enough to really attribute it to the drug - I did so because I knew that was the variable in my evening though. After 2 hours, I was bored, feeling nothing, and thought ""huh, maybe the pills are bunk - guess I'll take another two and see if that works (stupid)""

So I now have 660mg of MDMA in my system. My boyfriend arrives at about 10pm to my place, we play a game of Dota 2. I notice I'm speaking a little faster, and acting a little hyper, bouncing my legs on the balls of my feet quite rapidly as we play. 

At about 2am, we decide to shut down and go to bed. Normally I'm freezing as I have very little body fat to regulate my body temperature to begin with, and it's currently the middle of Winter here (Australia). I was extremely hot, and starting to sweat lying next to him under the blankets. I ended up taking off all my clothes and lying on top of the blankets experiencing the pleasantly cool (reality - 4degrees centigrade) breeze coming through my open balcony door. He's concerned that I'm sick with something, though seeing as I'm naked and we're both awake we start fooling around after I assure him that really, I'm fine, just a little hot.

He goes down on me, and I'm loving what he's doing. I start to notice rather distantly that my mind is starting to drift and it's like there are people talking in my head. I didn't realise just how involved in this feeling of physically hearing a non-existent conversation I was until I said something out loud in response to what one of them had said. 

My boyfriend lifted his head said 'what did you say? Are you ok sweetheart, do you want me to stop?' I said I was sorry, I just thought I heard someone ask me something. (I figured at this point that it would be easier for me to start to talk about my symptoms and have them passed off as me being unwell with a fever than try to hide them if I was speaking to no one out loud.)

He suggested that we should really go to sleep, maybe I was just stressed and tired and would feel better in the morning. By now, my muscles are twitching all through my arms and legs, my butt and my back. Every second or so I would have another spasm. My boyfriend is becoming quite concerned, I'm a little nervous but tell him I feel fine, maybe I'm just sick.

Three more times until I eventually fell asleep, I spoke out-loud in response to a conversation that I thought I could hear through my ears, not just in my head. My eyes were starting to wiggle a little, my heart was beating fairly solidly in my chest, and every few beats there would be one that would cause my eyes to wiggle fairly strongly.

I sleep, and wake up at maybe 5am gasping for breath. After a few moments I got my breathing under control and opened my eyes properly to get up and go use the bathroom. I was anxious to find that my white blinds closed over my balcony had jagged black lines twitching and scribbling all over them. I try to stand up and promptly tip sideways, I grab the back of my deskchair near my bed to catch my balance. I look at my hands, and I see black scribbles furiously moving over and around my fingers, like I'm holding charged balls of energy. 

The walls look a little like they're breathing in the darkness, I stagger to my bedroom door and can't find my door handle. When I eventually grab onto it, my grip was so weak that I had to try a couple of times with both hands to twist it open. 

I get into the bathroom, leaning against the walls for support as much as I can, and move to sit on the toilet - the white tiles have the same scribbles moving all over them but they're bright pink. I can also very clearly hear loud violins whilst I was in there.  I figured that though my heart was beating a little firmly, and I had to keep reminding myself to breathe evenly, I hadn't passed out or died yet and maybe I'd feel better in a few more hours.

I got back into my room, and managed to crawl back into bed without waking my boyfriend, and grabbed my phone to send an email to work telling them that I had a migraine and wouldn't be in that day. I mean, I could barely stand, I had no sense of balance and my head was spinning unpredictably every time I moved. Not to mention the visual and auditory hallucinations. At about 7 am, my boyfriend woke up and got up to turn the fan heater on. Instantly I could hear jazz band music, and what sounded like people talking loudly out in the hallway. I mentioned this to him, and that I felt really dizzy - at this point my heart started *racing* and I a major panic attack (that I've never experienced before) with crying, gasping for breaths, trying to lie down and closing my eyes to relax resulted in a sudden and intense sensation of falling and I would spasm upright with a small scream. I saw a papier-mache llama and giraffe stretching unnaturally long necks towards me and I threw my arm out to push them away when my boyfriend grabbed my wrists and calmly spoke to me to get my breathing to slow down. After about an hour, around 8ish am, I had calmed my breathing and heart rate but my muscles were still twitching and spasming. 

He tried to get me up to see how well I could walk, and I had absolutely no balance, kept grabbing at the wardrobe and walls to stay upright. He dropped me back in bed and said he would stay with me until 1pm, at which point he would have to leave for work - couldn't take more than a half day. He rang my mum and asked her to come down from Newcastle (2.5hours away by car), that I was very sick and needed someone to keep an eye on me. 

She came down, I felt mostly better by about 3, only light spasms in my muscles. She and I spent most of the day in bed, watching movies and shows on my computer. At about 8pm, after not getting up that day, I tried to follow her downstairs for dinner. I got to the bottom of the stairs and all of a sudden had a very loud and persistent ringing in my ears, they closed up, I could barely hear her or my brother talking. I slumped against a wall to catch my balance and I had an explosion of lights in my vision, which then whited out. It was like I was looking painfully through very bright static at everything, and it didn't matter if I had my eyes open or shut. I then got an intense wave of pins and needles down my left arm which then seized up, and my hand locked into a weird position which I then couldn't move. 

I said ""Mum, I can't move my hand and I can't see, help me sit down?"" and she was very calm, and took my hand and folded the fingers over herself a few times until I could move it, and then helped me to the table. 

I didn't eat, but had my eyes shut as I sat there, and I felt like I was spinning on the chair around the room. I was gripping the sides with my hands and would spasm every now and then. 

She stayed the night, when we went to bed shortly after the downstairs incident I could have sworn there was a kitten in my room, I could see it trying to claw it's way up the side of the blankets to me. I thought it looked really creepy and I felt scared, at which point it changed into a happy little puppy. Mum was now asleep, I could hear her breathing had slowed right down. Then I heard her laughing lowly and in quite a scary manner, then talk rapid gibberish before laughing again, and then saying my name over and over. I knew she was asleep, I had been hearing music and voices all day, I tried my best to ignore it and go to sleep myself. 

The next morning, I did get ready for work (Friday). I had a lot of trouble dressing myself, stopping to rest as I still felt quite weak. Showering was an ordeal as after standing for two minutes I had an explosion of painfully light brights in my vision again and couldn't see through them for what felt like forever. I was OK whilst I was sitting though, and as I have a sit-down job I felt I'd be OK at work. I was still hearing faint music, but not as invasive as before, and my stomach and smaller muscles through my abdomen felt a little jittery but overall the spasming stopped. I felt fine Friday night, and Saturday I started feeling very emotional whilst out with my boyfriend. I started having heart palpitations, and didn't sleep either of Saturday or Sunday nights due to very intense panic attacks and strange visual and auditory hallucinations that I found quite terrifying.

Please, PLEASE do what I didn't and make sure you are fully aware of what you are taking, how much a dose should be for low or no tolerance, and what an overdose will do to you.

My major mistake, well there were many (Erowid is now my best friend and I have taken this as an educational experience - million times more cautious now), but my major mistake was in assuming that MDMA would have a stronger effect than it did.

I am more familiar with harder drugs. I've been exposed to cocaine a couple times, ice(meth) once, both of which provide a VERY strong euphoria and sense of joy and excitement to be around the people with you, and buzz you full of energy. MDMA is far more gentle than those experiences, and not understanding how it would work on me, I re-dosed without really thinking about what I was doing, with the expectation that it would affect me like a stronger amphetamine would.

**Do your research and dose safely. Drugs CAN be used recreationally and responsibly, but we're the ones who need to take responsibility and remember that we're not invincible. They can hurt us if we are uneducated about what they do and what they can do to our bodies. I will not be making this mistake again, I found out the hard way.**

I bought three (one for myself, my gf (her first time too), and a spare just in case) because I thought that it being my first time it'd last a lot longer. My mates and I took it at around 7pm just before Borgore's set.

Because I've never taken it before, I had no idea what it should feel like. I started noticing that things seemed a lot more distinguishable and ""clear"". My friend kept asking me if it had hit me yet as it had hit him and his gf, and I just kept saying ""I have no idea"" then I realised that I had all of this energy and I didn't want to stop jumping around and dancing. And everyone was my friend. I just felt happy and great.

It lasted until towards the end of The Prodigy which was the end of the festival and that was absolutely incredible. 

I was still a little energetic on the way out while waiting for the free busses back to the train station and was just making conversation with everyone.

My gf and I ended up splitting the last one between us on the way home, got mcdonalds, and ended up having the best sex I've ever had. I then completely crashed for 8 hours.

Honestly, one of the greatest experiences of my life.

Hear me out and tell me if any of you ever get like this.

I have my really close crew (3 friends) that I go to shows with all the time. I know these people can handle their shit, on drugs or not, and regardless of whether the drugs are good, they love music so will love the show. I know that (while extremely rare for them) if they end up having a bad time, they'll either be upfront about, or are responsible enough to deal with it on their own.

It seems like whenever I go to a show with anyone else than them, though, I always end up unnecessarily worrying about them. Partially because I'm usually the one getting everyone the rolls ahead of time, so I always feel responsible. ""Shit, I really hope they're working for so-and-so. Oh god, are they ok with this crowd? It is getting pretty crowded in here. Are they too hot?"" etc etc. It ends up stressing me out and brings me down.

I'm writing this on the heels of a night that I'd been looking forward to for months. I was so psyched, and it ended up being a huge disappointment because I ended up in the back for half of the opener (who I was actually looking forward to more than the headliner) and all of the headliner's set, just standing there rolling for the first time in over 3 months, watching over my friend.

In retrospect (especially after she dropped some news on me the next day), I really should have been like ""you can go back, but I'm staying here."" We had a really great position in the crowd. Sometimes I wish I could just let go and say ""fuck you, I'm gonna have a good time.""

Most recently was after a roll I had Thursday night. I'm a huge Lakers fan, and if you follow basketball at all you know its been a really horrible season. On Friday and on Sunday, the Lakers have played the absolute best team basketball that they've played all season, and I found myself overcome with waves of intense emotion. Enough to bring tears to my eyes. Seeing the home arena crowd fired up and hearing their chants over the TV gave me chills for most of the game. 

Also I found myself hugely invested in the Australian Open Womens Championships this last weekend. I don't usually watch Tennis but I never realized how intense it can be. Every miscalculated swing tore at my heartstrings and I empathized immensely with the athletes performing half a world away.

I think the most silly example was my gf was watching an episode of Friends Sunday morning which happened to be the last episode, and I found myself welling up at the emotional interaction between Ross and Rachel, even though I really don't care for the show at all. I actually had tears streaming down my face....wasn't crying, but just couldn't control the strong emotions I was feeling.

I personally particular enjoy the strong emotional waves through my body. There is nothing like it aside from actually rolling. It also makes whatever I'm experiencing that much more enjoyable because I am that much more invested in it.

Since it has similar effects to MDMA, are there any 'negative cumulative effects' of taking both in a short space of time? Things like cross-tolerance or similar, eg. if they both act as seretonin releasers, the 2C-B trip would be poored since I took MDMA so close to it.

I went with a group of regular raver friends who advised that 4 ecstasy pills that were quite small would be a sufficient ammount. 

I assumed that such pills were like Ritalin and would act in 15 minutes, I proceeded to take the 4 over the course of my first hour assuming they were dud pills. Long story short, it hit me like a truck, I got real sad and they gave me another 2 over the next 4 hours that helped me kick out of the smacking and start enjoying myself. The night itself was great however I do wish I was 'awake' for more of the event.

The problem is, for the 3 days after it I was severely depressed, checked myself into a mental hospital in fear I was going to kill myself, my cognitive skills were severely hindered, on a pc game I felt like I was doing 1 click per second as opposed to 10?

My question is, even after the depression has passed, have I done any lasting damage and is there any other information/tricks/knowledge you would pass onto someone who has just entered the raver scene?

Thanks in advance.

The pills I had gotten were purple, domed one side and very chalkey with a mcdonalds imprint, my friend supplier said they were only chalkey because he accidentally crushed when wrapping for me, here are 2 local pill reports from sydney area.

Now, some good pills have more or less fallen into my lap (tested, confirmed with friends, and confirmed with convincing reports on pillreports, before you ask).  I plan on eating them in a couple of weekends with my lady friend, who has never done them before.
Since it has been such a long time, is my tolerance back at square one? 
The plan for both of us is to take a whole 130 mg pill, then follow it with a half pill in 45 minutes. I weigh 75 kg and she weighs 70 kg.

I got a big 7 day pill carrier and packed all my daily vitamins in it along with 5 caps of MDMA - also brought some speed pills, but it's not really relevant. Put the carrier in my toiletry kit, put the kit in my checked luggage and flew with no problems. 

I did have a *slight* problem with my carry on when they found a used one hitter in a long forgotten pocket of my backpack. Even that didn't cause then to do any additional searches. Just held me up for 15 min at security.

I rolled wednesday, thursday, and saturday. Yeah...I know. Obviously a dumb idea. However, after each day I rolled, I felt fucking fantastic. My mornings were amazing, and the rest of my day felt very afterglowy. That's kind of what led me to do it those extra times. 

Unfortunately, it all seemed to catch up with me saturday night and sunday morning. I've taken anti depressants before, and honestly, I felt like I was withdrawing from paxil or fluoxetine - terrible! My brain ""tickled,"" I felt nauseous, and I'm pretty sure I had the worst nightmare/ sleep I have ever had in my life. I'm fairly miserable. It's now monday and I'm still feeling like shit.

This, of course, goes to show how dangerous MDMA can really be and I hope everyone takes this advice and doesn't abuse this drug. It is incredibly euphoric and sometimes spiritual if used correctly and appropriately. 

P.S. - I've been taking 5-HTP and it seems to be helping quite a bit. My only question is: can I take more than it says I should. It says 1-2 a day, but I'm considering taking 2 now, and then 2 before bed.

Marijuana doesn't do much for me, and I've never gotten into anything harder. But I've been reading up on MDMA for a while, and really wanted to try it. So I got myself some, (tan sandy crystals) and planned to sit down with a bud for a low dose test run just to feel it out. 

Of course, 10 min after a tiny bit, felt nothing, so we took a tiny bit more, probably a fingertip or two. I don't have a scale.

Then it hit, and it just kept getting better. We went to a bar, and I just talked about everything. Normally I keep shit to myself, and have a very mellow baseline. My nickname is Spock for not showing emotion. Anyways, I just laid everything out there, completely honest. The bad side was that I really wanted to have more people out (and this was Valentines day), so I basically texted every girl in my phone. Bad idea. Next time I will turn my phone off. The feeling came in waves, and every wave I would just shake my head and close my eyes. It felt kind of like sex, but better and slower. I also was clenching my teeth like mad. Next time I will remember chewing gum.

We had a beer, and when the rolling started to subside, topped up for a little more, then went out to a club, but mostly just ended up talking. I really wanted to touch the fabric and thighs of every girl there, but didn't feel the liquid courage that alcohol brings, just a greater desire to socialize.

Anyways, I was buzzing til about 4am. When I was coming down to normal, I just felt kind of scared that I had changed who I was. It was literally a life altering experience, and I could feel my brain rewiring itself and reorganizing priorities based on this new feeling. I honestly think that I am not the same person today that I was yesterday. It's like I suddenly have to reevalute my entire life based on a new pleasure scale. I feel like someone else. I'm not sure if this should scare me or if I should embrace it.

It was also scary just how good that feeling was, and how when I was on the backside, still feeling good, I knew that it would never be as good as the peak, and I just wanted to chase that feeling all night. I find it kind of frightening to know that there is something that feels that good and it's so easily accessible. I know that I would just drown in it if I didn't have any self control.

For a while afterward I heard some strange noises, and would see people out of the side of my vision. Usually it would be a sign post, but I didn't feel scared or paranoid or anything. I also took a really long hot shower which felt great. I tried to wank one out, just because I was curious about sex and MDMA. I could get close, but there was a wall at the end and I couldn't finish it. Wasted a good 30 min in the shower trying.
I was tempted to get right back into it this weekend, but everyone seems to recommend long breaks in between. I will try to wait a while, and get some more friend out. I really want to share this with other people, but I don't want to be evangelizing drugs, or pushing them.

I felt like i still wanted to talk, to comfort her or w/e. And at some point she asked me, ""if i was going to talk""

1345744548.0,11,self.MDMA,ypgbx,General Advice after seeing some question posts that I feel should really have been asked before and not after your first time,12,1,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/MDMA/comments/ypgbx/general_advice_after_seeing_some_question_posts/,"Hi there rollers!

I know this is all on the side bar, but I don't think people are reading it and that really bothers me.

All I really want to say is - ***read the freaking side bar before you try it***

Honestly guys, I have seen some worrying questions along the lines of is it true you shouldn't drink water and such.

Over there &gt;&gt;&gt; in blue &gt;&gt;&gt; Drink water to prevent heat stroke

I just really want to give my personal advice which is this:

If you are trying this for your first time, follow these 3 simple steps.

.***Drink water until you pee.*** 

This drug will make you thirsty and it makes you thirsty for a reason.

MDMA dehydrates you so you *need* to drink lots and lots of water.

Not drinking enough water is very dangerous, however drinking too much water can be equally dangerous.

So my advice is always feed your thirst until you pee, then you'll know your body contains the correct amount of fluids. Once you start peeing stop drinking water for 30 - 45 minutes. Then try and drink one bottle an hour.

. ***Don't roll alone.*** 

In order to follow step 1, you need to follow step 2. Have close and trusted friends with you. Preferably at least one person who isn't on drugs.

This person can look out for you and ensure you have water. It's really easy to forget about it if you're too busy having a good time - but you *need* water.

I always have a designated water person. They spend the night on alcohol and get given 30 quid of my money. Every time they buy a drink, they also have to buy me a bottle of water.

. ***Do Not Mix Your Drugs.***

I have seen a few posts asking about the effects of coke and mdma when mixed and various other things.

The only thing I would ever *ever* offer someone who is rolling, is weed. And only when they start coming down.

That is just my personal advice however I would not reccomend mixing anything at all on your first time.

I personally don't see the harm in a few drinks before you take it, however your water friend should also be advised to ban you from alcohol once you're rolling.

Honestly you don't need it.

Whilst MDMA is freaking amazing, you still need to remember your health.

All I want is for people to have a good time. And this page has provided everything you need to stay safe and have a good time - yet some of you aren't reading it.

*Please read the side bar*

Check out the How to preload and postload link for optimal saftey and effects.

Check out the Harm reduction section ***please*** just do it.

Also check out the test kit!

And finally check out Silk Road. Also on the side bar.

I really can't stress this enough. Where your drugs come from matters!

Before I knew about Silk Road, I would *always* know the person who provided me, and then observe other people rolling on the same batch before I went anywhere near it. So I could judge how safe it was, how they felt, how they looked, what the week after was like etc etc. 

Silk Road offers a much more secure way of going about your purchases. Please check it out.

Oh and one more thing -

HAVE FUN

Be safe rollers!",,False,self,t5_2qwvg,False,,,True,t3_ypgbx,http://www.reddit.com/r/MDMA/comments/ypgbx/general_advice_after_seeing_some_question_posts/,

Background:

I'm 20 years old, have smoked lots of weed but never did any other drugs, I have a phobia of vomiting and a panic disorder. 

MAINLY what I want to know is, how likely is it that I will experience nausea?  That is the one thing I really cannot handle.  Is the nausea due to the neurological effects, or is it just because of the ingestion?  Is there a better way to ingest to decrease the chance of nausea?  Also, how much should I take?  I'm 5'3 and about 118 pounds if that makes a difference.

Other than that, any safety tips at all?  I can imagine being a little freaked out from things like rapid heartbeat and sweating because I sort of have a fear of things like heart attack.  

And finally, I'll be rolling with this girl I've known for a long time but have recently gotten closer to.  I know we're nothing romantically, but I get the impression that she wants me sexually because I know she does that, and just because of the way she talks to me, and how she really, really wants to roll with me.  Any suggestions for fun things to do together?  FTR we live in a pretty small town, not a city or anything.

1323191352.0,11,self.MDMA,n2o7e,Watching someone roll for the first time...,15,4,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/MDMA/comments/n2o7e/watching_someone_roll_for_the_first_time/,"So last Friday (4 days ago) me and a bunch of friends decided to trip because a few of them were under 18 and the club we were going to was closed down the night before. Anyways, we ended up with 8 hits of acid and 8 tabs. 

The breakdown

* Me - 1 Purple superman, 1 white 007, 2 teddy bear blotters
* Girl #1 - 2 white 007, 2 teddy bear blotters
* Girl #2 - 1 white 007, 1 teddy bear blotter
* Guy #2 - 2 white 007, 2 teddy bear blotter
* First timer (girl) - 1 white 007
* Girl #4 - 1 teddy bear blotter

The girl who's first time it was I could tell was really nervous. At first she only took half the tab, but about 10 minutes after took the rest. She was kind of scared but we did our best to ensure her that everything would be okay. We got in the car to drive to a really big park (miles wide) about 20 minutes after she took her tab (it had already been an hour and a half for the rest of us). About 30 minutes into the ride I looked over to notice she was really uptight and nervous still, so I gave her the best piece of advice I have ever received, ""Chill out, smoke some of this bowl, and forget about the tab. You cannot anticipate the roll or it will never come, just sit back and relax."" I kid you not, 15 minutes later, she put her hands straight up in the air and said, ""I'M ADDICTED,"" in the happiest voice. It was a great moment, not because we had hooked someone on the love drug, but because she was experiencing the powerful feeling of MDMA for the first time. It was beautiful watching her start to roll, feeling her hair, the car, everyone, everything. When we got to the park, there is a really heavily wooded area that we headed to and when we got there we laid out a huge blanket then laid down in a kind of circular pattern where we were all resting on each other. We played music, tripped, told stories, and talked about our lives in the way only MDMA will let you. We were all open, and so was she. The best part of the night was when she looked over to girl #2 and said with the biggest eyes and smile, ""I love you Girl #2!"" It wasn't in a creepy way you know, it was just pure bliss and love extending from her into another person, her first shot of MDMA love, and it was beautiful. 

For those of you that have never been with someone who is rolling for the first time, I really recommend it. Let, do not force or pressure, someone into your world and watch the happiness and comfort that they will now have and share with not only you, but everyone.

I always wait 1-3 months between each roll. I recently moved and don't know a local dealer so I did the research and bought 1g on SR from a very reputable dealer. Upon arrival I tested a little rock with the Mecke test which came up dark blue as I was hoping. Needless to say I was very excited. I took some empty pill capsules and measured out two pills, 160mg and 85mg for a dose/redose situation. For the first time I really dedicated time to getting the correct vitamins, taking vitamin C the night before and morning of, ALA an hour before and TUMS a half hour before as I always get an upset stomach when the roll sets on. I ate a burrito about an hour before ingesting the first pill at 7:15pm. 

Usually it takes me 20-30 minutes to kick and the roll to come across my whole body but after 45-1hr, I still felt nothing. About an hour in my eyes got very sensitive and I wanted to just close them. There was no effect on my body just my eyes and in my head. At about 2hrs in it got more intense and I had to leave the dance floor and sat on the grass with my eyes closed. My eyes started getting very twitchy and overwhelming so i just laid in the grass. 

Now I had gone to this concert by myself as I just moved to this city and  wanted to get out there and try something new so as I was laying in the grass these two girls, who were rolling, came up to me and introduced themselves and said they were walking round and wanted to see if I was OK. To me this is part of the magic of EDM festivals, just the kindness and generosity that I never see anywhere else. We ended up just talking for a while and I gave them massages and let them use my diffraction glasses and they honestly saved my night as it was going downhill quickly. We all went to the stage and saw Knife Party, who absolutely killed it BTW.

About three hours into the first pill my eyes would sake in waves maybe one every 5-10minutes. I had calmed down at that point and stupidly decided to take the second pill (10:30pm). The next hour and a half, through the Knife Party set I was dancing and feeling good just sharing good vibes with those around me but all of the roll was concentrated right in my eyes. After the set I took the train home which put me at my house at 1:30am, finally coming down from the roll. During the train ride and walking to and from the train, I got dizzy like once every five minutes and would start to stumble before I regained my balance. 

Overall I really don't know what happened and what attributed to this roll. I just woke up a little while ago and feel normal, no real hangover but I am just confused and wonder what could have 

happened. Any advise would be greatly appreciated.

I live in south Florida and have tested over 30 different types of ""Molly"" that i have received from around 15 different people and if i get it from the same person they reassure me its pure and better than last time, they are dealers they just want to make money. Out of the 30 different types of ""Molly"" i have tested i have found ONE person who actually sells me pure MDMA. Methylone is so cheap to get mass quantities that they are making such great profit they don't even care if its pure not to mention the feeling is no where comparable to pure please please please invest the 50 dollars for a test kit you WILL NOT regret it.

Example when i first started i was getting pure and tested in front of me. I moved away from the area and started getting methylone and thought it was pure but i knew something was different i just thought it was a diffenet type so i was getting a different feeling but i was getting nasty come downs and hang overs so i invested 50 bux and my MIND WAS BLOWN i know i've said it 1000 times but please buy tests kits you will be very surprised in the crap you will find. 

My friend has been taking methylone for 5 months thinking it was pure dosing at 500mg and loving it but it would fade very fast recently i gave him 200mg of pure and he said he will never take methylone again

   I've rolled 5 times now. I have never once experienced this ""hangover"" I keep reading about on here. I experience afterglow for sure. However I have not had a physical hangover or the mental hangover ever. I have not drank alcohol at all during these times, so I was wondering if it is related to alcohol or if it is something else. 
   Also, every time I have rolled, I have done so with my buddies who have been rolling for years and have a lot of experience. I asked them about all the pre/post dose stuff, and none of them have ever done any of the things I've read about here. I'm talking about the vitamins, the 5HTP, and all that stuff. I too have never done any of that in my small time experiencing this. So can you tell me what that is all about as well?

After months of planning, we were finally able to get our group all together for one night of fun, house party style. We have all rolled in smaller groups prior, but this is what everyone's been waiting for. We picked up a few pairs of finger tip light up gloves, a slew of glowsticks, anything menthol that you could imagine, and one treat that I thought was rather unqiue. My wife picked up a small package of wash cloths that she soaked in a peppermint human safe essential oil, and a bit of cold water. She put one on my face a few minutes ago and it was pure bliss! We are stoked to share these with our friends and may even freeze them a little while prior.
  
We created a Spotify account where everyone was able to dump their own favorite songs into so we don't have to worry about fumbling with playlists, YouTube, etc. There was a user here in a thread that suggested building a fort out of sheets and lights, so we are taking that idea up as well.

I'm completely new to drugs in general as I was against them for a long time (but that's a different story). Tried a line of MDMA with speed (I think?) on Saturday, just chilled with some friends, and it was incredible. I didn't do much at all either, maybe a third of what everyone else did. Anyhow. My friends were taking care of me especially as they knew it was my first time, and naturally they informed me of the 'tuesday blues'. I don't feel that way at all, on the contrary, I still feel wonderful! Has anyone had similar experiences of, I don't know, the opposite of a comedown?

I tried this stuff at the Nuit Blanche in Montreal last saturday, with some friends. I have no idea what the dosage was (2 small capsules).

I took my first pill at around 10 PM. We went for a walk downtown, going for the [SAT](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL-cvvtPaC4), where there was this 8bit special stuff. I started to feel it coming up while we were there, I had fun while playing an 8bit game, then we went for the dome in the video I posted just above. THIS was cool as fuck. I took my second pill while we were there.

We then left. We went for a walk in the Art Souterrain (Underground Art). That's when I started rolling. I watched the ceiling of the place where we were: it was a high ceiling, and there was this fountain that went up and up, with a blue light under it. Never had I seen anything so beautiful. We went for an art exhibition which portrayed cartoon stuff all melted, like it was made of ice cream. Holy shit was it nice.

I then proceeded to hug everyone I could in Montreal while we were walking away from the exhibition. We went back the the SAT afterwards. I then talked for like half an hour to a guy from Manitoba who was 10 years older than me. Never have I been so attentive to other people, besides my friends. I then went back in the dome.

There was a DJ (Ghostdog) who was playing some 8bit dubstep stuff while there were the best animations I had ever seen playing in the dome. I danced like I never had danced before, since I don't really like dancing usually. When I started coming down, I went outside for a joint with a friend. 

We then continued on walking and hugging random people, as long as they were okay with it, no hug rape hehe.

The effects MDMA had on me are as follows:

* Opened up my vocabulary (I'm francophone, I know very few people who have more vocabulary than me, but I never use it to its full extent.)
* Love for everyone (I don't like people usually). 
* Sociability.
* Energy. Lots of energy.
* Everything looks a LOT more beautiful. Especially girls.
* No hunger at all.
* Huge enjoyment for chewing gum.
* Thirst.

I had taken 1 5htp pill before my roll, and 1 after. Didn't crash afterwards.

Overall, it was the night in which I've had the most fun of my life. I plan on taking 2 pills like what I took again on the 27th of march. I hope I will have as much fun as I had this weekend.

1359859843.0,10,self.MDMA,17scto,First time trip report: psytrance rave (long story),13,3,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/MDMA/comments/17scto/first_time_trip_report_psytrance_rave_long_story/,"I have this group of friends who have gotten really into Goa/Psytrance in recent years, and every couple of months I'll join them at a rave and have a great time.  The music is not exactly my cup of tea, but it's really not bad once you have a few minutes to get into it if you're with the right people. Add to that the fact that everyone at these gigs is exceptionally friendly and that the entire place is invariably decorated like a psychedelic meadow on a foreign planet, and you can have a lot of fun.

Now, I've always drunk alcohol and smoked weed with them (the only substances I'd tried so far), but despite wanting to do it a couple times I always pussied out of trying MDMA at the last second. I would usually leave the party at 4 or 5am, never understanding how my friends could have the stamina to stay well into the morning hours.

Yesterday was another one of those nights, and I'd decided earlier that day that this would finally be the occasion for me to expand my drug horizon. Fast-forward to late evening: we arrive at the place fairly sober; my friends have their stash confiscated at the door. This bums everyone out, but within minutes they find someone to buy some pills and powder off. (I don't know how they got it so fast or whether they had it checked, but I'm fairly sure they know what they're doing so I don't worry about it.)

At this point I'm pretty tipsy and really baked, and my initial reaction when I'm offered some powder is to say no. But then I realise I'm really not that wasted, and that I'm just rationalising because the thought of trying MDMA for the first time is making me pretty nervous. After a brief moment of introspection I finally decide it's now or never, the hell with it, and ask my friend if I can have a tiny sip of his MDMA-spiked water bottle…

""Sure,"" he says, and hands it to me. There's about a glass worth of water left. Having no clue about how much to take I ask him if I should finish the bottle. He smiles and tells me to have two sips for now and wait a little. Psychologically, this is a big deal for me, and my hands are shaking a little as I take two tiny sips because I'm so apprehensive. I decide to take a third sip because my first two were so cautious and hand the bottle back. I remember to glance at my watch so I can gauge my time perception: it is 2:15am.

---------------------

At first, I'm not sure if it has started kicking in or if I'm just really baked. I feel like I'm tightly wrapped in a warm, thick blanket, or like my body is glowing. My anxiety has all but faded away, and I feel incredibly clear and lucid. In fact, I'm feeling considerably more head-sober than before, but I realise that this might be an illusion. At this point I check my watch again, thinking about 15 minutes have passed since my first dose; it's been an hour.

I'm offered some powder again and take my first dab on the tongue, washed down by (regular) water. Now that the psychological barrier is broken, I don't feel uncomfortable or anxious at all about my second dose. Many more spliffs and drinks are had, and I reflect on how it feels like I can drink and smoke more than usual and still feel in control. This is the exact opposite of how weed and alcohol usually make each other worse when taken in combination.

At some point I go grab some fresh air outside and realise how weird walking feels. It's almost like I'm floating, but I still feel lucid, and not at all like I'm ""wasted"". I end up sitting on the steps outside smoking a cigarette, and I just remember a perfect feeling of contentedness. Like everything was exactly the way it should be. I realised how I go through most of my life with a certain baseline of stress and anxiety, and how you can only really tell when it's completely gone for a change. Alcohol also does this if the mood is right, but at the expense of being drunk instead of ""clear"".

I find it very easy to immerse myself in the music. This is usually not difficult for me to do with music I really like, but even with psytrance it happened almost without effort. Again, when I say ""immerse myself"" I don't mean it in the same way that this happens when you're baked. On weed, it usually feels like your focus narrows, to the point where only you and the the objet of your focus exist and you tune everything else out. On MDMA, you're still very much aware of your surroundings; especially the people around you.

---------------------

This is becoming a long story, so I'll go through the rest of the night in less detail: I have a quarter-tablet of E and another dip of powder, interspersed with a bunch of doobs, but almost no alcohol after the first couple of beers, simply because the compulsion to always have a drink in my hand was less strong, and because I wanted to pace myself. I did drink a lot of water though, since everyone always says that's important. The place closed at 6am, and we went to similarly-themed afterparty until 9am. At some point I had another quarter-tablet. We finished off the night by going to the apartment of a couple that was with us, having 2-3 more doobs and talking.

Just as I'd read and heard, my inhibitions dropped. I didn't talk to many strangers at the rave but had some great bonding moments with my friends, saying stuff that I would normally feel silly about, like how much they meant to me. But it still felt like it was ""me"". It wasn't the drug talking, it was simply enabling me to say things I feel that I would usually not mention in conversation.

One thing I noticed at this point in the night was that my short-term memory was completely fucked. Multiple times I would be in the middle of a sentence and have to stop, because suddenly I completely forgot what I was talking about. This is the only real negative effect I noticed. This, I think, is also the reason that my time perception for the entire night was off. Everything felt shorter than it actually was, and it's probably because I kept forgetting small chunks of the night.

I stayed up for more than 24 hours, having only slept around 4 hours the night before. Especially near the end, I was aware that I felt tired, but like I could choose to ignore it if I wanted to. I went to sleep with a mild headache and, since I had to get up, set my alarm for 4-5 hours later. I didn't know what to expect, since I had heard that MDMA hangovers could be pretty bad, but I slept like a baby and woke up fairly refreshed, given the circumstances. I feel like, if I had only consumed alcohol that night, I would be considerably worse for wear.

It is now just over 24hours since my first dose, and I still feel a slight afterglow. I gotta say it feels nice. I wouldn't be exaggerating if I said I had one of the best nights out I've ever had. I'm definitely trying this again when the next rave comes along.",,False,self,t5_2qwvg,False,,,True,t3_17scto,http://www.reddit.com/r/MDMA/comments/17scto/first_time_trip_report_psytrance_rave_long_story/,

Well, I've had my first disappointing MDMA experience. Before you lecture me, I know that 4 weeks is supposed to be a minimum between rolls. Consider me appropriately chastised. Here is the timeline of my rolls:

Roll 1: 80 mg - Just a taste. Had a great time, and saw the vast potential in this substance. Ready to do it right next time.

Roll 2 (3.5 weeks later): 150 mg - INCREDIBLE! Simply the most beautiful, life changing experience I've ever had on a drug. This played a huge role in saving my marriage.

Roll 3 (3 weeks later): 150 mg + 50 mg @ +1:30 - Still great. Not as good as the last time, but awesome nonetheless. Chalked it up to different quality molly.

Roll 4 (4 weeks later): 135 mg + 50 mg @ +1:30 - Almost as good as the first time. Pure bliss and euphoria. All around great time.

Roll 5 (2 weeks later): 145 mg - Oh no. Something's not right. I have all the physical sensations, jiggly eyes, enhanced appreciation for music, overall good feeling, but something was definitely missing. I had NO euphoria whatsoever. At what should have been the peak of my roll, I found myself rather melancholy and bored. I don't know what the deal was, but I just didn't enjoy it that much. It felt like I was just going through the motions. I'm not able to pinpoint any one thing that was different, but the phrase ""the magic is gone"" described it pretty much perfectly.

So my question is this: Have I permanently ruined molly for myself? I've heard it said that once the magic is gone, you can't get it back. Is it possible that it's an isolated event because 2 weeks just isn't long enough? The only thing I did differently was take 100mg of 5-HTP about 12 hours before my roll. This was the same molly as the time before. I am planning to try again in 8-10 weeks. Might I get the magic back, or am I screwed?

There's some good, some bad, and some TMI. I want to document this, but at the same time, I hope it might be of help. I know it's long, but you don't have to read.

BACKGROUND:

So, the backdrop is that this past weekend was technically my second experience with MDMA. I had done it a little over three months ago, but it was spiked with Amphs. This was fine for my friends, but they hadn't overdone it with Addy XR the night before. My first experience was mostly intense heart palpitations, chest pains, mild euphoria, some beautiful light visuals, and mostly death-fearing panic. To say the experience killed my roll would be an understatement. Whether I actually had an overdose on amphs or not, I'm still unclear. From everything I've read, the answer would be yes.

MOVING ON:

Two days ago, I went to a massive rave with friends. I detoxed for about a week, no caffeine, no addy, nothing. I was pre-loading with Vitamin C, Omega-3s, 5HTP.

The caps were tested and were a combination of MDMA and MDA. Unfortunately I do not know the percentages of each or mg dosage. Sorry.

On the day, I dropped I took the first cap at about 7:22P.

The Gross Part: As I was coming up, I felt the need to use the restroom. I sat on the toilet and went a little, I think I was mostly driven there by concern rather than an actual need to go. However, it turned into an endless wipe. It turns out that things had opened up down there, nothing was coming out, but I believe I was probably trying to wipe my lower intestines clean. This went on for about 20 minutes as I cursed myself and said that I will never do this again. ""Fuck this. Never again."" I was googling trying to find some explanation online... to no avail. However, then I recalled a friend telling me about a similar experience. So, I made sure everything was in order and shrugged and left the portapotty. Yes, gross, but this was clearly the scariest part of the night. Anyone else have a similar experience?

Not Gross Part: I walked out of there saying ""I will never do this again."" Only to realize that I was rolling. Then I quickly started saying ""OK. OK. OK. OK. Yeah, I get in now. Holy shit. Holy shit."" And then dashed into the crowd where Simon Patterson was playing. I was dancing pretty hard, but this is normal, when I dance sober people start coming up and giving me back massages because they think I'm rolling.

I met up with my friend. One was rolling on the same pills I took when I had my bad night. (White pumas with gold flecks aka MDMA and Methamphetamine) He was having a good time, and my other friend was having a good time on addy.

I felt great, happy, getting some light eye wiggles, the lights looked enhanced, etc. However, while I was feeling great with a shit eating grin on my face, I was missing the whole empathic thing that I've heard about. This leads me to believe this may have been a higher MDA content than MDMA... or it may just be my personality.

We danced for a while until we went to see Orbital. My friend sometimes gets emotionally bummed out by trance, so he left Orbital for the drum and bass stage. We danced and I stayed in the same happy state there. Went to get water and caught a fireworks show. Caught the end of Oribital, walked around, caught some other stages, met some new people, etc. Had a Vik's inhaler on me and it worked wonders bringing the roll back when it was dying down. I don't smoke, but I took a drag on my friend's cigarette, and that worked well too.

RE-DOSE: 

At the time, I knew it probably wasn't the best decision. But I was feeling like I was coming down. My other friend kept asking me if he could have me second cap (he had already taken the puma and one of my MDA/MDMA caps). He had another tab on him. I thought it was probably not a good idea for either of us to take another round this late, but if one of us was going to do it, we should both do it. Around 10:50 (only about 3 hours until closing), we re-dosed. He took another puma I took another MDA/MDMA cap.

ROUND TWO:

I didn't have the same stomach issues as my first drop. But in about 30 minutes it hit me hard. REALLY hard. The three of us were walking vendor booths and talking when suddenly I felt like I was being pulled by the music. ""Sorry, I have to go,"" I told them as I dashed off into the crowd listening to Benny Benassi (I'm not even much of a fan).

Thing is, I kept coming up and kept rolling harder and harder.

Pretty Lights came on, and my friends joined me. I don't normally don't stomp my feet when dancing, and tonight was no exception. However my feet became very tender and I was having trouble standing. I wobbled to the floor, and went into what I can only explain as a full-body sustained orgasm. It was so intense that everything else kind of melted away. I was a bit torn as I really enjoy Pretty Lights and I wanted to dance, but I was too overwhelmed by this (which I was very much enjoying). I decided to roll with it and walk away and sit in the grass. I started talking to a group of girl who I explained that it was my first time... only to realize by their awkward responses that they were completely sober. After a few more minutes (or seconds, I'm unclear) I walked to catch the end of ATB's set. I sat on the ground listening to the music still overwhelmed by the full-body orgasm feeling.

When Dash Berlin came on, my feet started working again, but I still felt like the roll was getting harder. I was slow dancing in the back to the music, soaking it all in. Putting my arms up felt REALLY good for most of the night, this was no different. On each of his slower songs I would put up an arm and slowly walk through the crowd.

At this point the eye wiggles were getting intense. Combined with the trancers, I'm pretty sure that I was functionally blind for a good five minutes. Fortunately I was well aware of this aspect ahead of time, so I was prepared for it, otherwise it may have scared me... but maybe not judging by how good I felt. The wiggles calmed down a bit. I during this time I had a couple open-eyed visuals, very minor, things out of the corner of my eye. I thought a guy was leaning one way, but he was actually leaning the other. I forget what the other was, but they both occurred within the span of a few minutes.

My friends were pretty burnt so they were in the back sitting down. I met up with them and I sat down as well, I closed my eyes and realized I was having closed eye visuals. Mostly patterns, squares twisting coming out like puzzle pieces from one another. Additionally, I did get a few very clear visuals, as if you were looking at a picture, nothing like the visuals you get as you're going to sleep. These were photo-realistic almost animated-gif-like. It was only a few and they were very minute, something along the lines of a slice of pie sitting on a table in someone's backyard as the wind blows.

We stayed here for a bit, but I was starting to feel more in control of my body. The full-body orgasm feeling was becoming a bit more manageable, it was either becoming less intense or I was getting used to it. As you can imagine, while orgasming, it's hard to do much.

We got back up and danced until close. After 2AM, my friend who had redosed with me had come down. We met up with more people who quickly realized that I was still rolling extremely hard.

I think I started coming down around 6AM when everyone else had been asleep for a few hours. On a risky move, I post loaded with some 5HTP and Vitamin C around 4AM, before I had completely come down. Which I've heard is a bad idea as you might cause Serotonin Syndrome.

The next day, we checked out of the hotel and had some breakfast. I'm unclear if it was just an afterglow or I was still rolling, but I felt REALLY good at breakfast. I told myself that it was ridiculous that I could be rolling still, but later I read that some claim the MDA can last up to 12 hours. So, it was possible.

Later that night, I looked at the traffic signals and they looked enhanced and beautiful. I was also getting some tracers. I don't know what that means, but afterglow maybe? Suggestions?

I had a number of myoclonus jerks in the evening, which I felt amazing for a few seconds afterward. They would occur when I thought of or saw something that reminded me of the previous evening.

No major issues today on the back-end. I'm hoping that continuing to post-load with Vitamin C, 5HTP and fruits will keep it that way. I feel sluggish and slightly dumb today. Eyes have trouble focusing and I have to hit the bathroom constantly. No bummed-out feeling yet. Who knows about tomorrow.

If you made it this far, please let me know if you have any feedback. I apologize for bad grammer, etc, I'm in recovery mode today and I know my writing isn't really up to par.

However, it seems to be an inevitability that the magic wanes to some extent over time. For the long term rollers, I've got some questions about this:

* Do you have to keep increasing the dose to have as much fun?
* Is there a 'plateau' for a safe-but-still-awesome dose? I currently take about 0.15, no bumper, and it feels great... but just not *as* great. Is it better to kick it back? Its really important to me to not burn myself out long-term, I'd like to enjoy MDMA safely for as long as I possibly can.
* Do you ever get tired of it/its not worth it anymore? In terms of health/effect, I mean.
* Any natural or non-MDMA related things I can do to enjoy it more? I hear a lot of 'take tryptophan' or 'take vitamin C', but it all sounds a bit old-wives-tales-y.
* Bonus for the 30+ rollers, are you still going? How old can you be and still do this? I'm 25 and looking forward to doing this as long as I can healthily get away with it for.

1366760819.0,9,self.MDMA,1cz0st,First time - What should I be feeling?,9,0,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/MDMA/comments/1cz0st/first_time_what_should_i_be_feeling/,"Aquired some MDMA off silkroad (&gt;300 transaction vendor - crystals not pills) and packed it into capsules today. Since this was my first time taking it I did it at home. Took ~130mg. Felt very little after an hour. Took another 60mg +T 1:30 after intial dose. Dancing is good fun and I was dancing for a good 90 minutes (although still have occasional feelings of tiredness). Definitely feeling the rhythm and had occasional hot flushes (probably due to the dancing). Don't see any change in visuals apart from maybe feeling slightly removed (tiredness?!). I'm also feeling quite happy but nothing incredible.

So what I'm wanting to know is how should I be feeling and could it be my setting that's not making it the incredible experience most people have?

I'm thinking of taking ~190mg straight up before going to a club this weekend to see if it is more effective. I'm aware that I should be waiting a month or two before redosing but I'm incredibly curious about the incredibly experiences most people seem to have. My stats: 5'10"", 160lb.

Currently +T3:00 in.

EDIT: Smoked a very small amount of weed earlier on and ended up stuffing myself with food. I'm now realising (stupidly) that this is probably why I didnt feel much for ages.

EDIT 2: Finally feeling extreme happiness (palms are sweaty, jaw is acheing a bit, occasionally catching myself clenching)! Seem to be very keen to reply to everyones reddit comments with fairly long answers, seems like the sociable angle to MDMA has arrived. To all those first timers out there I would suggest a few things:

- Don't spend the night ""experimenting with MDMA"", just set out to have a good time. If you're trying it at home try to chat to people on facebook or something. I think my biggest mistake was lying down at the start waiting for the effects to start (like how I started with ketamine). This is just not like any other drug. I've come to the conclusion that it's about not thinking about it.
- Make sure you have a good playlist up. I danced for a good 90 minutes and now im sitting with my legs up listening to music and feeling like a god (even Radiohead is sounding happy!).
- Don't eat too much before. I had a very small joint in the early afternoon and ended up absolutely stuffing myself (to the point where I was desperately trying to squeeze one out to relieve the feeling of fullness). I'm fairly sure this is one of the reasons why the effects took so long to appear with me (unless it wasn't MDMA after all).
- Be careful if you're depressed. Seriously. I'm normally an incredibly depressed person in real life and despite being a very sensible person normally (the kind other people's parents like) I can tell I'm probably going to end up doing this more than I should just to escape normal life. Wish me luck and hope that I can hold out!

Looking forward to trying my first LSD experience soon. This month has been very experimental!

EDIT 3: WHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

EDIT 4: Okay started at 10pm last night and stayed up until 7:30 am! Danced for a couple of hours (alone lol?!?) and then relaxed on the sofa with my legs up, music on and the Drugs chatroom up.

No anger, no worries just an extreme sense of happiness and love.

A few months ago I tried shrooms for the first time, I didn't adequately mentally prepare myself, I was doing it with new friends in their dorm and I foolishly took a large 4gram dose. Some combination of all those factors and my awful gut cramps (or maybe it was constipation) and being unable to pee because I couldn't relax enough led to extreme paranoia. At first it was just me being nervous during the come-up, which slowly spiraled into depression, anxiety, over-thinking, tension and fear. At one point I was convinced I was going to go crazy... Three hours in I was on the verge of tears I wanted it to be over so badly.

Anyways, that negative experience with a more ""powerful"" psychoactive drug has made me nervous to try other stuff, like MDMA. Granted when I did shrooms I broke a bunch of the important rules of trying drugs for the first time, but that thought hasn't completely abated my nerves. If I was to try M tonight I'd be doing an 80mg dose with 4 close friends (one of them is the person I called to take care of me during my shrooms experience), in my house rather than an unfamiliar dorm room. We'll be buying all the recommended vitamins and a bunch of gum.

BUT despite doing everything right this time around, I have some lingering doubts. Can someone compare the come-up on shrooms to that of MDMA for me?

Then I went to this huge party with an incredible line-up, and I decided that I wanted to give XTC a try. So I took it at that party, and since then I don't like dubstep and drum 'n' bass anymore, I LOVE it.

I know you're more open to different kind of music when you're on MDMA, but how common is it that you really like a music genre more than when you're sober?

Nexth month I'll be going to a party with probably the best line-up since the party where I took XTC for the first time, but my friends are going to another party...

Luckily I have another group of friends with whom I did MDMA once in July at my home when my parents were on vacation, and we really want to do it again, but don't know where since we all still live with our parents (for the record; we're all over 18 tho).

So my idea was to take them with me to the big dubstep and drum 'n' bass party, to share the awesomeness of an EDM party, while on MDMA.

Problem is, they're not into EDM at all. They liked some songs I let them listen to, but it's not that they listened to it more after that.

So my question is: How likely will they still have a great time when they are at some party on MDMA, but with music the whole night long they usually don't listen to?

My guess is that they will experience the same thing as I did, despite I already was into the music genre, but the tickets for the party are quite expensive and I don't want to take the risk that they'll be bored for most of the night.

The people I'm rolling with have been doing similar dosage and timing and obviously have more experience with the drug. Being new to the scene, I really have no context as far as how much is too much other than my own limits of how I feel the next day. In general, I've had practically no hangovers (other than the first time where I had been drinking), just sluggishness from not sleeping and minor nausea at times. I've always felt completely back to 'normal' in the next 24 hours.

I only just discovered this subreddit and read a comment where someone said ideal spacing for doses is 90 days, which I have obviously surpassed many times at this point. Am I getting in way over my head here?

Edit: As far as a dosage estimate, the most detail I can give is size 0 caps about 3/4 full.

Before, i had three times in one night vividly hallucinated lying on the sofa reading a book but being unable to make out the words, so i knew how intense and real they could be.

 So i got .4 of a gram and wrapped it into two bombs, one then the other half an hour later. I smoked a little, starting to feel the first one, smoked a little more, then BAM as the second one hit. 
My vision spiralled off into the distance. I had been doing that thing where you make a sausage appear between your fingers, and suddenly my hands stretched 20 foot apart with enormous gaps between them and the tiny, far off sausage in the center.

 For the next few hours everything i looked at was a constantly shifting and writhing mass of patterns and objects, OEVS and CEVS. They changed so fast that i couldn't describe them to my sitter before they had changed into something else and i forgot what they were before. I was like 'it's a dog with, no a man doing, it's a b-, no, a fox, now it's a, no it's a...' and that was just describing one little guy in the animated where's wally that was my field of vision. I tried outlining some of the things i saw in still shots of the jungle episode of planet earth but i'm circling nothing at all in most of them. Don't remember what they were supposed to be. 

The thing i expected least was a sudden epiphany moment. While i was having a shower, some simple 'truth' presented itself to me. It was one of those things that seems obvious when you know it but might be difficult to spot before someone points it out, like evolution was, like learning as a kid that the sky is not a ceiling. I wish i remember what it was. Something really simple, like 'all life is xyz'. As it popped into my head i stood there dumbstruck by the obviousness of it, but as i began to think it over, it slipped from my mind, seconds later. Damn, i wish i remember, or had had it when i was near my sitter so i could have told him. I wonder if it was something totally ridiculous or something that made sense. 

Anyway, highly recommended if you like tripping, at least the equal of acid in my opinion. What about you guys, do you like smoking at the same time? What sort of stuff does it make you see?

If you're reading this, I would like to thank you for your helpful comments that you will post below.

I'm going to a party this Thursday, and I have had my e pill for a couple of months. I've stored it well, and I got it from a reliable source. It is a two dose condensed pill, and I plan to use it Thursday. Now here are a few questions I have:

How long will the intense high last, in which I will not be able to fully communicate with people? My parents might pick me up after the party, how long will it be until I can act semi-normal around them. (I have smoked weed for a while now, and they reluctantly allow me to smoke).

When is the peak of the high, and how ""high"" will I actually be? Should I stay inside? Can I go swimming (in shallow water)?

What should I eat the day of? Anything in particular, to help? What about the day after?

How will I feel coming down? 

Is there a ""hangover"" per say?

Not to seem all cocky and shit, but I'm a smart kid. 16yo male. Will doing this fuck up my future? I want to become a doctor, will doing this once fuck up those chances? Will there be any really bad damage? 

I know these are kind of hard to answer, not knowing the exact pill I am taking, but I know my source very well and she promised that this was pretty pure. If you could just use your experience to help me that would be great, and please don't hold back, say WHATEVER you're thinking.

I would really appreciate some strong advice or guidance for somebody who has strong expertise with the long-term interactions between MDMA/other entheogens and SSRIs

I am a 19 year old male, and I have been using MDMA and a plethora of psychedelic substances for almost two years.
(Also dabbled with heroin for about half a year (due to depression/anxiety) but went to treatment last month and intend to stay clean)

Over the last year, I have sunk into a dark period of depression and social anxiety, mostly due to isolation from losing the people I called my ""friends"". I can also attribute my anxiety to heavy marijuana use, which I have quit for the moment being.
I had a post a few months ago explaining my problems detail here in the mental health section if anyone remembers it: http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/6...off-the-charts

I have been seeing a psychiatrist for 2 and a half months. I got diagnosed with social phobia/anxiety disorder, OCD, and mild depression. She has prescribed me the medication lexapro (escitalopram) which is an SSRI. She also wants me to maintain sobriety after telling her my past history of drug use... (of course). I have been taking lexapro for about 2 months. At first I was put on 10mg for about a month and a half. Now I am 20mg and have been taking that dosage for about 1.5 weeks. Sure it helps my anxiety a little bit. But I also don't feel as sharp, feel a bit blunted, have insomnia and weird vivid dreams sometimes, and feel a little bit more depressed at times. I know that I SSRIs take about 4-6 weeks to kick in (and I am on a new 20mg dosage....) but I am not seeing any big miracles yet. I think this is also in part because I am conflicted whenever I take the medication. I don't look forward to it. Why? Well because it means I won't be able to take MDMA or other drugs of the like safely. I would really like to discontinue my lexapro treatment... and I know that doesn't sound like it would be medically good for me but I really do miss ecstasy.

I love music and raving. And MDMA/psychedelics introduced me to a whole new world, and at this age I really don't want to give that up. I love going to concerts and festivals, and they were one of my best sources of happiness. Although due to abuse, it may have triggered some of the issues I am currently facing such as the social anxiety. However I have learned to be a more responsible drug user. I haven't touched MDMA/psychedelics in about 4 months anyways, and won't dare touch it especially on this medication. Another reason I want to return to it, is because I used to go to a lot of concerts with these 2 individuals who I considered close friends. Well, we aren't friends anymore, and they turned out to be very fake individuals. Do you know what it is like to have a ton of magical experiences on MDMA/psychedelics with people, but now no longer associate with and dislike you? It is pretty depressing. In part this was my fault, but I wanted to separate from them as I felt as they were very artificial. I am going to a new community college this upcoming Fall, and I am hoping to meet a lot more genuine people, and I am going to do my best to make good friends and won't make the same mistakes. I really would like to do MDMA again, but I can't while under this SSRI.

I have read that tapering off SSRIs is hard, but I don't think it will be that difficult for me. Especially with a new generation SSRI like lexapro. I have skipped days before of not taking it and I felt fine. Maybe even a little more like myself when I didn't take it... especially recently with my high 20mg dosage.... what scares me though is how long it stays in your system and that it potentially changes your brain chemistry. I read somewhere on this forum that it can take months for your serotonin to go back to normal from SSRIs and that even after many months MDMA will still feel reduced. This part really scares me. Since I have been taking it for only 2 months I don't want to be on it for like a year or something, and then when I stop taking it I try to roll 4 months after I quit and I don't feel the same effects... That would be very sad.

I would like to get off it ASAP, but I know my psychiatrist wouldn't advise it and she would ask what is wrong. Would it be unwise to not take it, but tell my doc I am taking it anyways? I'd feel guilty if I did that and would feel like I would be wasting her effort and mine. I feel like I can tackle my anxiety/depression on my own without it though.


Need some strong advice from someone experienced with this kind of stuff....this is a hard decision I have to make here. Thanks for reading I really appreciate it.

So, with the background info out of the way, on to the problems.  During the comeup, I have very intense nausea.  Bad enough that I can't talk to anyone and need to focus on just me for about 15 minutes.  Once that passes though, I feel fine and can dance and talk and do all the normal stuff you should be able to do.  The next few days are some of the worst I ever have though.  I have to stay on the couch for one-three days and I can barely eat because of the indigestion.  I have to make frequent trips to the bathroom and can barely keep any food in (both nausea and diarrhea).  I have the same experiences with both mdma and mda, although the mda seems to have a higher peak roll and a lower low the next few days.

I've been taking tums, vitamin C, and 5-htp the next day (all recommended doses as per their packaging), but nothing seems to help.  Does anyone have any suggestions for things to do or take that might help with my comeup nausea and/or my hangovers?  I should mention that I don't get depressed like some people do, just the intense stomach problems.  I'm looking for advice so that I can roll on the first day of a multi day festival (for my favorite dj), without worrying about having the intense problems for the next two days of the festival.

Now i bought some supplements, namely:

* Vitamine C / 1000mg

* Vitamine B-6 / 100mg
* Magnesium / 200mg
* 5-HTP / 100mg (98%)

As the effects were rather underwhelming (pleasant, but no real peak) this time i will try a higher dose next time (150-200mg / 50-75mg i thought) and would like to get some info on how i should take the supplements (i.e. from now until the roll in ca. 3 months, only a week before or entirely different..)  and in what dose/intervals.

I first wanted to say that I was pretty much in the dark about most of the culture surrounding molly. I went to Bonnaroo for my first time, and after a few years of poking smot, I decided to roll during pretty lights. I knew roughly what was supposed to happen, how long it was supposed to take, etc, but not much else. 

I was blown away. 

Pretty Lights started at 1 AM and was basically 70,000 people rolling their asses off. I took a capsule that had what i assumed to be the normal amount (i think someone said it was a 10 point? whatever that means) and it was orangey. It was from a friend of a friend so I was confident - turns out I got the good stuff!

There were 5 of us - 3 girls and 2 guys - all rolling for the first time. I didn't really know the guys or one of the girls very well, which turned out to be all for the best. Like most people, I was relatively excited but had pretty low expectations; since I'm a generally happy person and love to dance CRAZY all the time, I didn't see much of point. But boy was i wrong.

After the usual stuff that happens the first time - heart rate, nervous, wtf is going on - the warmth spread. And I realized that I was in a crowd of 70,000 best friends with exciting things to show me. 

I had coincidentally brought with me a fairy wand that lights up and has different settings. Not knowing molly, I just thought it would be fun to dance with and didn't really think about it. Turns out it was the best decision I ever made. Not only did I dance the SHIT out of that wand (and occasionally try to eat it...whoops) but everyone loved it and I made so many friends! And the look on everyone's face when I let them hold it was perfect.

As I started my way into the crowd of people, I was amazed at every turn. Whether it was fairy wings, giant bubbles, giant glowing eggs, light up hoops, or just glowing paint, the world was an oyster of new things to rediscover and new friends to make. I am so happy I didn't know how amazing it would be. A nice girl tried to put some kind of stick up my nose and for a second I got scared - i thought it was drugs! turns out after some explaining it was Vicks VapoRub. It was AMAZING! Another nice guy (after a brief kiss) gave me spearmint chewing gum. That was amazing too!

As a sea of 70,000 rolling people each introduced me to another wonderful aspect of the drug - whether it was the feeling of fingers in your ears or a back massage or a hug or a kiss, I was overwhelmed again and again. And we danced until the sun came up, thanks to pretty lights. I even made a facebook friend (it took 30 seconds).

But the best part was the amount that I bonded with the people I came with. Turns out one of the guys was an amazing freestyle rapper! And sharing a relatively tough comedown with the new girl made us immeasurably close. We talked about what it felt like when we first met each other and our first impressions/expectations. We talked about everything.

After a few hours of pretty lights, we decided to explore the wonder that is Bonnaroo. We took pictures in the strangest places with the strangest people. We took pictures with the glowing egg. We took pictures of random kisses. And the best part? We used a disposable camera. And we're going to develop the film together. I can't wait to see them. We passed people in the streets and had spontaneous dance parties. We skipped, we laughed, we jumped, we touched a giant mushroom (it was a fountain but it had turned off. Sad, but didn't dampen our spirits). And then we went back to pretty lights and finished off the night with a hug.

As the sun rose, we all walked back to our tent, slowly feeling the ache in our legs and the beat of our heart slow. The hard part was falling asleep - just as you feel normal, a heat wave shoots through you and you don't want it to leave. But i was peaceful. I was tired, and peaceful and happy.

While new girl and i were coming down, our neighbors saw us shivering and took us in. Still feeling the effects of their bump, they gave us chairs in their circle and blankets and we all came down together as my friend and i shared our first time experience with them. 

It was perfect. I was a child. I was an adult. I was amazed. I was floating - I am still floating. I danced like an idiot for the rest of the festival whenever i felt like it. I joined in with the rolling people. I danced by myself. I was happy and free.

As someone who is a tad hyperactive and thrives on community, I finally found a drug and a place where I can be myself. I think I would honestly be just as happy going to a place like pretty lights where everyone was rolling and just soberly dance with them and make friends. But now that I know how it feels, I won't be scared to join them. 

I know this is a really really long story and if you read the whole thing, thank you. I just wanted to get it out. 

also - random question. I waited a day to smoke any weed and got weirdly hyperactive and extremely high the next time i smoked. It was fun...but weird. Any thoughts?

I was just wondering if there was any other of you guys that love trance music when you're rolling? To me, it's the best feeling, even if you're on your own. Trance music is the sort of music that makes you feel something, it portrays a message without the need for lyrics. 

My favourite tunes while rolling are:
The Kingdom - Estiva 
Wildflowers - Suncatcher 
The Gift (Tritonal Air Up There Mix) - Norin &amp; Rad vs Recurve 

And of course, some vocal trance never goes astray. The downside to where I live is that there aren't any clubs that cater to trance music in the slightest. :(

A few weeks ago I was at a small local music fest and went a little overboard with my dosing. (150mg + 150mg after an hour) and got some REALLY trippy and very vivid CEVs.

As I understand it MDMA is metabolized to MDA so there's a psychedelic component to all MDMA experiences, but I've never had anything close to this. It was pretty interesting, but a little overwhelming.

One of my favourite mdma memories is having my teeth brushed by my boyfriend. The minty taste was wonderful.

11:40pm - i get home and dose what i approximate to be 200mg into a bottle of water and shake thoroughly.  i drink 3/4ths of it now, hoping the last 1/4th of the water bottle will tide me over while i'm peaking.

11:50pm - i feel jittery, and turned on some it's always sunny in philadelphia (the boat episode).  hopefully i'll be coming up by the end of the episode.

12:10am - i dose the rest of the water bottle in anticipation.  i'm also packing a bowl, because last time as soon as i smoked, it set the roll off.  i'm definitely ""feeling"" something, heaviness in the back of my head, heat throughout my body, it feels great.

12:16am - during the packing of the bowl, i notice the first wave of euphoria.  it's a warm pins and needles (in the best kind of way) feeling all over your body.

12:20am - i'm feeling it for sure.  it's creeping up my neck and ready to kick.  i'm gonna smoke this bowl to kick it out.  outside is cold as fuck.  its always sunny in philadelphia is hilarious.

12:24am - could only smoke a couple hits, i'm saving the rest of the bowl for peak time.  it's hitting me, i keep checking my pupil dialation and it's steadily rising.  its been 40 minutes since the initial dose and 25 minutes since the redose.  awwww yeah.

12:26am - getting hard to type, feels like i'm remembering i'm doing this trip report for the first time, i started telling all the cats how much i loved them and i feel so great.  i can't decide which cat i want to tell first.

12:32am - pupils fully dialated.  i feel fucking amazing.  i feel great, great, great, great.  im trying to get ahold of people to tell them that the quality of this batch of molly is outstanding, and i can get more.  i'm amazed that i'm sweating so much, and my sweat feels more like water than perspiration.  i notice my accellerated heart beat (i butchered that word, i know) and it feels like i'm tripping.  this is fantastic.  i don't know what to watch, i feel like i can just lay in my bed and be happy without anything on the tv.

12:41am - rolling my balls off.

2:14am - still rolling my balls off, slightly more controlled though.

What are the effects of dropping a 2nd pill? 

Is it really worth it at an event to take a 2nd? 

Would say taking 2 pills each day over a 2 day span be drastically harmful/ what are the effects positive and negative as far as neurotox + how it feels? (Related to huge events we have going on such as Coachella, Burning Man, EDC etc.) 

From what I understand MDMA mainly releases serotonin with a little bit of dopamine, is there another substance that releases dopamine and a little serotonin which can be taken after the first pill?

Any suggestions for something else to take other than a 2nd pill? Or does it really matter considering the small amount of pills being taken?

Do you still adopt those fundamental values of love and unity even when you're not rolling? Why/why not?

Would you still take MDMA if *that feeling* could be reached through other means?

I personally like to entertain the idea that it might even someday be our popular vice of choice instead of alcohol or smoking. I don't think I'd be half as anxious about our ability to relate or understand each other if more of us embraced the respect and feels that MDMA lets us tap into.

Speaking of *that feeling*, here's a good question. Does *that feeling* always exist? What is *that feeling*? Is it just a contruct brought about by a drug, or actually something really important that we're on the cusp of unleashing into the general public? Just playful thoughts.

I was with very good friends of mine , we we would almost all drop for the first time , we were all very excited ! 
So after a 20 min walk to the field (we were like 80 at the party) we begin to chill , smoke bud , installing sound system and all . Now it begin :

- ~22:30 we have the money together (5-6 friends) to buy the bombs, i buy 2 0.1 bombs of ""95% purity MDMA"" (that's what the dealer , i did'nt believe it but wait for it ;)). I drop my first bomb with 2 close friends immediately after buying it . The party goes on , i drink like 2 or 3 teq paf (knowing that MD + Alcohol its not so good for your body) , smoke some joints , dance , chat , have fun , in brief I Have fun .

- 23:30 I became very knowledgeable before rolling , i was expecting the first effects after 20 or 45 minutes but i wasnt feeling anything i was expecting the first effects after 20 or 45 minutes but at that hour, nothing was being felt but i've been chilling with my crush at this moment and she say ""Man ! Your pupils are BURST ! :D"" . I care no more than that, but I could already see, for example, people complain to the dealer and one of my friend had gone in search of a tree to hug ( so the bombs were taking time to take effect , or not ) . II was dancing , when a friend ask me to play music from my external hard drive , i played some Spor , Le Peuple de l'Herbe , Birdy Nam Nam , Mr Oizo , some good Dubstep , i was dancing with my friends and at a moment i noticed that when i was closing my eyes , BAM ! I felt the effects in the outside of my arm , it was like sparkling in my arms and it was sooooo good :) , but only when i was closing my eyes , it was weird but fun .
So i danced like this for 10 min , eyes closed , with a big smile , moving to the bass , grooving, (i'm a big fan of drum n bass) and at 6:46 of that tune : http://www.mix.dj/index.php?act=medias&amp;CODE=view&amp;s_id=33088&amp;dj=Ch&amp;mixtitle=Jung-Up i opened my eyes immediately and BOOM ! began to dance like a crazy guy ! I danced around but always in perfect harmony with the musqiue on tempos, the wobbles. friends, people I did not know came to dance with me, I was told I danced really well, I was **synchronized** with the music ! It was an awesome feeling :) then different music style have been played , i danced with unknown people , chatted with about music , their life etc :)

- After (i don't remember time after , all i remind is very intense memories . At the time I remember have really enjoyed every moment the party but after the trip but I found out that this happened very quickly) At this time i begin to notice friends and ""new friends"" are down or descend (i mean the effects of MD are leaving , i'm actually the only one of my friend that have a second bomb in his wallet and one of my tall best friend didnt feel anything so the GGG dealer gave him a second pill for free) , i begin to feel a little descent too but the friend who find the D and who was more experienced told that with D ""you have ups and downs but it's not over yet ;)"" , so i go to a bonefire where all ""my"" friends are , down the field , we talk , have fun , my crush who didnt roll this time to ""assist"" the first timers in case of badtrip or what (she's a GGG isn't she ? :)) , i look at the stars , at the fire , it's so intense and beautiful . I then asked my crush if I can put me on her , she is cross legged at this time and i put my head on her legs . It was so comfy , warm and pleasant , she began to give me a head and hands massage that was almost orgasmic ! She then suggested we smoke a fat joint in the tent next to us with two other close friends , we smoke , get really high from some fresh Bubblegum who give me a big ascent , we laugh , talk and i drop my second bomb with TASTY orange juice (that was one of the intense memories) and get of the tent.

-02:34 (i just remember the exact time when i dropped my second bomb) we come back to the bonefire and i think he is one of the most beautiful thing i saw in my life . I lie beside and looks closely, I feel like in an FPS, I only see this wonderful fire ( a friend told me my face was 30 cm from fire) . I look at all all its movements, its undulations, its sparks, crackling sound, it fascinates me, I passionate me . My crush told me i was like that for 2 hours , saying : ""Oooooh ! Woooooooow !

I plan to go clubbing this weekend and plan to have some good times! I've done MDMA twice in the past, but always with friends. I never bought it so I'm not aware of it's street price.

I'm posting this because in my social network there's no one I can ask for direct advice. I'm taking a Masters in London and just arrived in town. With that in mind, I'm not really familiar with the procedures of actually getting MDMA.  

I suppose that asking in a subtle manner around in a club for pills might do it but I'm not very confident with my spoken english. I'm afraid of looking like a total noob; add that to the fact that I'm not aware of price/quantity ratios and disasters are likely to occur.

A few years back, before I educated myself about test kits and erowid, my friend picked up some 'brown sugar Molly'. It was in normal sized capsules but the product was a very dark brown, almost blackish, and stuck to the bottom of the capsule. I didn't take it because it didn't seem right. I put in my little pill case where I kept my other pills. I didn't roll for a few months and one day I wanted to check to see how many pills I had in my case. That 'brown sugar' had melted out of the capsule somehow and eaten in to my other known MDMA pills and had turned into some black slush. I still have no idea what it was but it was so disturbing 


More recently, at EDC, my friends picked up some ""Molly"" but didn't want me to test it because there where afraid it might not be pure and they don't want it to ruin their night. It ended up being bunk and they brought it to my room so I could test it. I used a large pinch and spread it out a bit. The marquis reagent turned into a hodgepodge of reactions that was yellow, bits of green/brown, bits of an orange tinted yellow color, and random specs of red. 

Weirdest reaction I'll probably ever live to see. 


Have any of you seen some strange reagent reactions?

Or had something you knew that wasn't MDMA being sold to you?

I have always waited at least 3 months between rolls and have been pre/post supplementing (I did the complete recommended preload from the top post on /r/drugnerds for this most recent roll) since my second time. The roll was very underwhelming, much more so than the previous ones (all of which were amazing, ""best night of my life""-borderline-life-changing), and caused me to think that maybe I've already ""lost the magic.""

Unless my good friend pulled a fast one on me (I know that this is possible, but I don't think so), the molly I took is the same stuff I took for my third roll - the best one I've ever had, it had me absolutely out of my mind - and it tested positive for MDxx with the Marquis reagent. I took between .2 and .25 of powder, orally, most of it at once and the rest during the come-up. This is about the same amount, if not more, than I took last time.

Come-up was nothing too unusual... I had this feeling like I was suddenly taller than everyone else and that I could ""see everything."" Not long after that I was rolling and it lasted for a few hours, but I rarely felt anything describable as ""euphoria,"" and not once did I feel the slightest increase in empathy. In fact, my friends decided to leave the show early and I actually recall being fairly angry/disappointed in them (""They're going to leave?! Fuck them!""): feelings that I wouldn't have thought possible during my previous three experiences. I was never compelled to smile for no reason... I was just able to lose myself in the music and dance hard. None of the beautiful feelings, just the effects I'd imagine I'd get from taking straight speed.

Is it possible that I've already lost the magic in just four uses, or did something else happen here? I tried LSD (or what I thought was LSD... Marquis can't test for it, but I definitely tripped on *something*) for the first time the day before, but from what I've read there isn't much cross-tolerance so idk if that had anything to do with this. Maybe it was something else sold as LSD that could have dulled my roll? Or is it more likely that my friend swapped my good MDxx for something like meph/methylone? Is it possible that my friends leaving put me in a sour mood that just couldn't be overcome by MDMA?

I'm fairly new to MDMA and have got hold of some for a house party coming up. I'd like to get some information about how best enjoy the stuff I've bought!

I've bought a couple of grams for me and some mates. I'm led to believe that it is of high quality although what percentage, I am not sure. How should I best prepare for taking MDMA? Is it best not to eat for a few hours? How much should I be taking? I have got some scales which will help measure fairly accurate the right amounts.

What's the best way of ingesting the MDMA? Some of my friends like to snort it while others make rizla bombs or poor it into a bottle of water. Ideally I'd like to come up gradually and stay at the peak for as long as possible.

What's the best policy for redosing? I'm going to a house party that will run from 10pm until 7 or 8 in the morning. I don't expect to be rolling the whole time, I just want to enjoy it for as long as possible whilst staying safe.

Finally, I know this is quite a vague question, but how can I best ensure I have a good time and not a ""bad trip""? Is it all about being in a calm and happy mood?

Thanks for your advice!

EDIT: One more thing, what effects might drinking some alcohol have on the high?

I've always spaced it out at least 2 months and have never redosed. Also, I always test my stuff and use an accurate scale. I don't take any supplements (although I'm looking into) and live a mostly healthy lifestyle. Sometimes though, you gotta make an exception!

Two months ago I took 125mg (I'm 65kg) for a concert and had a great time. I hadn't rolled for two months before that. Fast forward to the next weekend, I ended up getting tickets to a great show that I absolutely had to roll at. At the time I wished I hadn't rolled the weekend before, but I never planned on going to the second show. I was very hesitant and despite finding plenty of conflicting information online, I ended up taking 145mg the second weekend and had an amazing time.

I remember feeling great for days afterward and had absolutely no signs of a comedown even though I was honestly expecting one. I waited two months and rolled again last weekend, taking 125mg. I rolled just as hard off as I have before and again with no comedown. I don't want to say that tolerance/losing the magic is blown completely out of proportion on this subreddit, but just wanted to offer some anecdotal evidence that you can in fact roll two weekends in a row without any noticeable side effects as long as its not a consistent thing.

Bit of back story involving my history with pills.

1st time I ever used was a pill - CK. The euphoria hit me so strong I had to sit down. It hit while I was walking down a huge hill into the city centre and I just stopped, said 'woah' sat down and stared at the sea &amp; city &amp; everything for 20 mins taking in the beauty. When I got to town &amp; sat down waiting for a friend, I experienced intense nausea for about 10 minutes and then let rip a burp so mighty it got a round of applause from a group of guys at the other end of the street. I was then fine &amp; spent the entire night complimenting anyone wearing white underneath strobe lights.

2nd time I was an idiot &amp; have no idea what I took. The come up was intense! I was dancing &amp; then it felt like my brain was burning. I went to the toilets &amp; sat on the floor for 30 minutes debating over if I needed an ambulance. It felt like my brain was on fire. Then it just stopped and I hit some sort of spiritual plane. Nothing in the world phased me, I've never felt anything like it. If I went on the dance floor, a switch flipped and I wanted to dance! My friend needed a chill out moment and a switch flipped and I wanted to chill! It was like I felt nothing at all but it felt good and could do anything.

3rd time I had a blue defqon. Took half which was amazing, took the other half a few hours later because I was too off my face to remember how long it had been and then I promptly fell down a flight of stairs.

I've never experienced any of these problems with powder and now I have a Nintendo for tomorrow night.

I don't want my brain to burn, throw up, or fall down the stairs lol.

I think pills might just be too much for me so what do you guys think?

Here's what I did: I was at Ultra Saturday with two friends who are both experienced drug users, including mdma, and one of them provided the molly, which was white crystals that they ground into powder. The other friend said it was one of the top three best and purest samples he's ever tried, out of dozens of times. We put it in pill capsules and I took one of about 120mg at 3:30 PM. By 4:30 I was feeling jaw tension and dry mouth, but still did not notice any positive effects by 5:30, so my friends suggested I take another, and I took about 160mg at 6:00. By 6:45 I was beginning to feel good and I rolled hard from 7-9, but then the effects quickly dissipated. I was going hard as fuck but I'm pretty sure I drank enough (maybe too much) water. My questions about this experience are:

1. I haven't done anything particular since then and am a little bit worried. Are there any vitamins I should be taking or sleeping extra in order to make up for rolling on Saturday?

2. Did I take too much? Most places say about 100 mg is a solid dose, but I'm pretty confident our product was very pure, as my two good friends agreed. Was there some reason I needed so much to feel the positive effects and why it wore off so quickly, as my friends thought I would be rolling until midnight? Is individual resistance to the drug a thing?

3. It is Tuesday and I am just a little paranoid about lingering effects. There hasn't been anything substantial really, but I have a little buzzy/fuzzy feel in my head sometimes. Maybe I'm just paranoid and it's from still being exhausted from an insane week last week, but I'd like to settle my fears.

I'm not a drinker and I have no notable vices.

With a female friend of mine, I decided to do molly. So I dropped some money on 5g and came home with almost 7g (I guess we found that mythical nice dealer). Go big or go home, right? :)

My friend portioned everything out and managed doses. It was mixed with a little water (and chased with a sweet drink to wash the horrible flavor out).

The first time, she kept the dose on the really low side for me. It felt quite nice. Body was tingly, heart rate increased, definitely lost some inhibitions and was more open, felt very content and happy. All in all, was damn good. I never really felt any sort of come down. She gave me an initial dose then about 20 minutes later (I wasn't feeling the first much at all yet) another of the same size so that I would peak again. I think the cuddles and whatnot helped distract from any feelings of coming down I may have had and that's why I don't recall any.

The second night, a slightly higher dose was given to me. Same intake method. Same effects as the previous evening just a little stronger. Still no harsh come down or any sort of unwell feelings or anything negative. Additionally I had caught a cold and that night my throat had been very sore, but on molly and for the entire night after I was on it, it was no longer sore. Nice little side effect.

Still had plenty left over after both of us had our fun those two nights. So don't think we went overboard there. I wasn't afraid to do it as I was with someone who was knowledgeable. She kept doses for both of us managed and timed and the company was perfect.

I think if I hadn't had my friend with me (for many reasons), I probably would not have chosen to do it. But I trusted her and it worked out. We were already close so there were really no overshares of feelings or anything. I also can't ever see myself wanting to do it alone.

I stayed up for about 8 hours after dropping, got two hours of sleep and felt fine when I woke up, but as the day progressed I just felt shittier and shittier.

The MDMA was a eggshell powder with chunks from SR. Although her teeth chattered she didn't chew up her mouth or hurt herself, although she was a little sore the next morning. She had a great afterglow and very little negative effects.

Next time we roll in a month or two I plan on getting her some magnesium and avoid calcium to prevent chattering... is this a good plan and why or why not?

1357467682.0,8,self.MDMA,16218d,Just wanted to share my story about the roll i had on NYEE in Chicago.,14,6,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/MDMA/comments/16218d/just_wanted_to_share_my_story_about_the_roll_i/,"So it was the day before NYE, and i went to see Hardwell and Porter Robinson at the Congress Theatre in Chicago. On the hour and a half drive there i took a 20mg adderall xr (orally) and eventually i arrived at the Congress and found a parking spot. I called up my cousin and his room mate who told me they had five mints and we met in my car. Turns out they had already took all five. Okay so we do a couple lines of blow in the car, the three of us and my girlfriend and i take another half of a 30 mg adderall before we go in.
So headed into the Congress first the guys check ID's. Next they scan your ticket, turns out my tickets were for the next day. The scanned my ticket and let me go, no questions asked. After a minute i noticed my girlfriend was behind and having trouble. The guy ended up ripping her ticket in half and told her just hurry up and go. After this ordeal we all got patted down by security and let into the venue.
First we all head to the bathroom, buy some water, and head into the crowd of people. Some random guys were playing some mediocre music and i started on my search for Molly. Its always a hit or miss, sometimes the first guy you ask has Molly, other times everyones on it but no one has it. Anyways, about thirty minutes went buy and i had asked about six or seven people and got nothing. Out of nowhere some guy asks me if i had any mints. I told him ""no man, sorry"" and as he was walking away i quickly told him to let me know if he finds any. The guy looks at me like i'm stupid and says ""i just asked you if i wanted any."" Then my face lit up with excitement and i asked what they were and couldn't hear a thing he said other than that they were the best in Chicago so i get my friends and all together we pick up six pills. I took two of them on the spot, i chewed them up in my mouth and they tasted like shit, which is great. They looked like blue ovals, i almost thought they were advil. 
Thirty minutes went by and Hardwell got on stage and i rolled my fucking face off. I had to stop for a minute because it was almost too much. It was almost as crazy as my first time rolling which is a whole bother story in itself. I don't know if anybody else knows the feeling but for a few minutes while i peaked i kind of started to feel claustrophobic and nervous. Anyways, i come down a little bit and Porter Robinson comes on and plays a great show and we all danced and had a great time. 
We leave the venue and it was crowded but we all made it to the car and we did a couple more lines and find out about an after party about an hour or so away that a mutual friend is DJing at. We all do some more blow in the car and we take off down the street, my girlfriend and i following my cousin's car. Turns out somehow the tire on our car came off the rim. I get out and we're all tweaking on blow and its about fifteen degrees out but we threw on the spare in like five minutes. More adderall on the way to the after party and we finally made it there at about 3:30. 
I found my friend there and asked if he's seen Molly so he points us to a guy with a long braided pony tail. My girlfriend bought some and we split .6 of a gram. The guy gave it to us in a baggie, so we just snorted it in the car. Then my roll came back and we all danced the night away at this house party, i helped out my drunk friend and kept making him drink more and more water. I did a few nos balloons and we ended up leaving at 8:30am.
Finally got home and went straight to sleep. That night/morning was probably my favorite out of the dozen or so times i've rolled.",,False,self,t5_2qwvg,1357474881.0,,pills16,True,t3_16218d,http://www.reddit.com/r/MDMA/comments/16218d/just_wanted_to_share_my_story_about_the_roll_i/,
1357153403.0,8,self.MDMA,15u7v1,Can someone try to explain/help me figure out what happened new years eve night? had some bad side effects of MDMA(?),9,1,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/MDMA/comments/15u7v1/can_someone_try_to_explainhelp_me_figure_out_what/,"New Years Eve at around 8:30pm, five of my friends and I were getting ready to take capsules of molly that one of my friend had gotten from her dealer.  One of my friends had never done it before and I'd only done half before (but had an amazing, love-filled time when I did) so I was trying to ease her worries about it before she did it.  We decided we'd each take half.

The capsules were filled with white powder of 200mg so we split it in half, poured a little bit less than half in our mouth, and stored the rest away (we each had one of our own)

About two hours later, neither of us had started really feeling anything yet at the rave that we were at so we took some more (about the same amount as before, and saved a little bit).  Our four friends had taken the whole pill and were already rolling pretty hard at this point.

After the 2nd time, my friend said her stomach started to hurt but was beginning to feel it and have a good time. I was feeling it, feeling more like dancing, but not feeling the same lovey-dovey vibes I'd had the last time I'd taken MDMA.  We decided to finish off the pill.  

The last two hours of the show, I was rolling pretty hard and having a really good time but lost all of my friends. At 2am, I found the friend who'd never done it before and she said she'd just thrown up in the bathroom 14 times.  She was freaking out and having a bad trip.  We took a taxi back to our friend's house that we were staying at.

When we got there, she went to the bathroom to keep throwing up and I sat down on the couch.  After a couple minutes, my heart felt like it slowed waaaay down (almost like it stopped for a few seconds) and I got really light headed. I went in the bathroom after this, with her, and proceeded to throw up for almost three hours.  I can't remember another time in my life feeling so sick/miserable/worried about my health and I just couldn't stop throwing up. At the end, the throw up was brown and acidic. I tried eating bread but it took so much effort to swallow it.  My friend was still feeling lightheaded/numb/tingly all over.  This misery continued until 6:30 am when we finally were able to fall asleep for about 3 hours.  

At 9:30am, all of our friends and us woke up and seemed fine for the most part.  The two of us that were sick the night before felt awful and could hardly stand up until 1:00pm, and I was completely out of it mentally all day.  

Before the concert, at around 5:00pm, we'd all eaten a pretty sufficient dinner and the night before probably had around 6 hours of sleep.  I'm 5'8"" and around 140lbs and my friend is 5'0"" and weights 103lbs.  

The four of our friends that took the whole pill in the beginning didn't have any problems with it and one of them had also never done MDMA before but she was fine.  The last time I took MDMA, I had no hangover and it was one of the happiest nights of my life.  

I was wondering what could have possibly caused this to happen?
Could MDMA have done this, or is there any other drugs it could have been laced with that might have caused this type of side effect?

I am ~100 kg, quite healthy, generally happy, and I am not on any medication. Preloading with vitamins and magnesium, but no 5-HTP yet. Several months between every roll. Brown, crystal MDMA every time, from different sources.

The first time I took MDMA, I scaled up 150 mg and took it orally. Other than a slight tingling feeling in my body, no noticeable effects. The others in the group, who took the same MDMA and the same dose, reported that they were tripping quite hard. No problem sleeping afterwards, and no hangover.

The second time, I took 300 mg orally. Still just a slight roll, but of course a bit stronger than the first time. After a few hours, I decided to snort additionally 200 mg. The rush came quickly and was very enjoyable, but I still felt that the effects were not as high as what others seem to experience even with a 150 mg dose. No hangover, no problem sleeping.

The last three times I have taken MDMA, I have used one gram each time. I usually take 600 mg orally and snort 400 mg after a few hours. This makes me roll quite hard, and I believe I have about the same experience as those who are less sensitive and take ""just"" 150 mg. I am not sure if I actually fall asleep afterwards, but the hours sure pass quickly when I am in my bed and close my eyes. The hangover is pretty much just a mellow tickling feeling in my body, and a ""lagging"" feeling when I turn around or move quickly. After a few days, everything is normal and I don't feel very burnt out as some people report after taking high doses.

I do realize that the dosage must seem very irresponsible, but I have not yet had any negative side-effects. First time taking such high doses was two years ago. Anyone else having the same ""problem"" with such high insensitivity, or am I alone on this one?

I rolled yesterday for the first time. It was really funny, when I started peaking (and having eye wiggles and seeing closed eye visuals for a bit) I was briefly thinking, ""This is like nothing I have ever experienced before, am I dying? Will I ever recover ? Have I broken my brain?"" I reassured myself that it would go away in a few hours. A few minutes before that I noticed that I was feeling a little more relaxed and my heart was beating faster. Then I was texting my cousin and talking about how my father putting up people to call me and trying to control me really frustrates me/hurts my feelings. I had just typed the text to her and hit send when I felt sadness almost physically hit me and I started sobbing. Usually I'm very very numb and anxious. I have not cried that way since I was maybe 5 I think. I was doing MDMA primarily for PTSD so I felt sad many times during it but I felt like I could be sad and then happy in a few seconds in not a mood swingy but weirdly in what felt like an authentic way, in that I wasn't suppressing sadness/numbing myself in order to feel happy. I had some realizations about my parents growing up, ways in which they were unavailable to me that caused me to feel ashamed. I had some inkling of these things but it was like a faint inkling and ""maybe, maybe not"" I did not see these realizations coming AT ALL. I guess maybe it was just too anxiety provoking for me actually stay with.

I did the MDMA alone in my dorm room because the friend I wanted to do it with was busy and I didn't want to wait until next week to do it when I would have a dozen homework assignments. I was/am a bit concerned about what my roommates thought. I'm not really sure what to say to them... ""umm I was working some stuff out"" ? I am afraid that they would know I was on some kind of psychedelic. Maybe I can just make an excuse that my grandfather died or something.

I called up the friend who was busy and we still talked about some things. I disclosed some private stuff about my father. I'm not sure how I feel about having shared that with her now. I realized some things about my family and had some memories come up. I had been having flashbacks and I feel that I have a fuller picture of some trauma that happened to me. Some of it is like, ""Oh no I don't know how I am going to deal with this now.""

I had one of my profs who I was feeling alienated from and while I was rolling I think I remembered his facial expressions in a funny magnified way and I think now that he is and always has been ""on my side"" or at least this is what I said to my friend on the phone while I was rolling. I just asked to work with him so I guess we will see what he really thinks. I'm afraid I'm wrong and he isn't but I feel like he is. I think that he thinks that I'm very very smart. He has always looked at me with a lot of concern and I feel now like he knew things about my life and that's partly why he was concerned but I really am confused as to how. MDMA is an amazing drug, I have been on loads of antidepressants and I just felt numb and awful about myself. I felt ashamed and didn't feel like doing anything good for myself while at the same time feeling a bit ""opiated"" (not that I've ever tried opiates but it was rather like being on morphine and someone sawing your leg off and feeling terrified but being numb and calm and unable to feel the depth of what was happening to you).

With MDMA I did not feel numb, it was amazing how easy it was to feel things, almost like the MDMA does it for you.

I also called a friend of mine who made a very unkind remark (along the lines that the trauma I suffered was my fault) that triggered most of the flashbacks three years ago who I was unable to talk to about how disappointed I was in her actions. I told her calmly that I was disappointed and that I can't be friends with her if she can't sort out her own issues. She kept sort of trying to deny it like she usually does but instead of getting overwhelmed and overruled by her demeanour I was able to stay with my feelings and think, ""Oh no she doesn't get it."" I stayed on point and told her that her remark made me feel very ashamed and hateful towards myself and after that I just had the urge to hurt myself. I was able to see why I clung to the friendship even after she made this remark that was ripping me apart inside, she was my last friend from the ""vineyard christian fellowship"" period of my life before I de converted from Christianity, and I just couldn't give up the hope that someone from there would get it and get me. I think because MDMA allowed me to feel sad and not numb it, I was able to feel the sadness long enough/observe my emotion long enough to ask why the sadness and make this realization. I was able to feel sadness over having to give that up/give her up yesterday.

I think that in my childhood a few people knew something awful was happening but they just didn't know what to do about it. I realized that my grandmother before she died really wanted me to recover and have a good life. She knew I was traumatized and that I needed help and she believed that I deserved to have a good happy fulfilling life. I think she felt somewhat helpless and I believe that she was.

I was really anxious as I was coming down from the MDMA, I took some 5HTP and I almost felt like I was rolling again. I don't know if this is the normal experience with it. I am still feeling the effects of it now, I'm kind of wondering when this bit of afterglow/anxiety is going to go away, I feel like I am open to things but I'm also feeling anxious like I don't know if I can quite handle this.

One thing I am struggling with a bit now is that while I was rolling I realized and accepted (?) to some extent I am very smart. While I was rolling I realized that a few people in my life really like me/admire me for my mind. I feel sad about how I have continually tried to hide/been unable to express that part of me. Having come down now I am quite uncomfortable with thinking that, I kind of prefer to think I'm dumb. I'm planning to roll again in about five weeks (I guess around Thanksgiving?) so maybe I'll better be able to think through some of this then.

I'm feeling a bit unmotivated/lethargic/depressed today. I've been thinking of going to the gym since that often makes me feel better.

TL:DR This is a surprising drug. I don't understand how it MAKES you feel things. I'm still feeling a little bit overwhelmed about how it makes you feel things.

I've never double dropped. Never felt the need to. I've never redosed. Again, never felt the need to. I know a lot of people who double (or more) drop in a single night, however. And even this health conscious community often talks about taking two pills in one night.

My question is, do you think it's any more or less safe to take one pill one night and a week or two later take another vs. taking those two pills in the same night. Everyone always talks about how you should ideally wait at least a month between, but there's never any mention of doses in that. I would have to imagine taking 125mg on two separate nights with even just a week between has got to be better for you than taking 250mg in one night. Then again, I don't know nearly as much about the physiology behind it as I know some people on this community do. What are your thoughts?

So, I know that if you take MDMA and drink alcohol at a party you're probably going to have a bad time.
As far as I know, the danger here is dehydration. You'll sweat a lot while dancing on MDMA, and alcohol dehydrates the body even more.

So would it be safe if I stayed home with some friends, drink some alcohol (not much, I don't want to be drunk, but a bit tipsy), make sure I drink a lot of water, take some MDMA and make sure I'll drink enough water for the rest of the night?

Or are there other dangers when you combine alcohol with MDMA?

Maybe there are some people here with experience on this, any stories/advice?

Some backround info: my friend(we will call him bob) and i decided that we would like to try ""rolling"" because we had heard so much good stuff about it. We smoke weed on a daily basis, more like an hourly basis, lol, but we said that it wouldnt be as good as bud(WRONG). We also live in hawaii, on oahu. still in high school/senior year.

Saturday came and we were out and about at around 2pm. Bob's friend was suppposed to get us the rolls around 4 so we had to wait till then. This was the same weekend as a rave, so ecstasy was goin around and most people were selling. We went to go meet up with another friend at the mall and as soon as we park, we see two other close friends who come say hi to us. After about a two minute conversation we find out that they're looking for ecstasy(they've rolled countless times before) and since they didnt have a car we tell them to cruise wit us for the night and they agree. We go in the mall and just walk around for a bit, browsing stores and find out that bob's friend cant get the rolls, and our other friend has to go to work so now theres four of us. I call up my friend who supposedly also could ""hook us up"" but he couldnt get either. now were bummed out and calling every person on all of our contact lists to see if they can get ecstasy and after 45 mins of trying, this girl says she can but not till 930 and its only 730 so we all decide to go to the beach(our secret spot) and burn some to kill time. We get high as fuck and head to mcdonalds cuz everyones hungry. I read a lot about rolling the past couple of days so i decided not to eat at all and just sip some water. they ate their blazed brains out while i just sat there waiting and starving. 10:00 came and we didnt receive a call so we called the girl and its a negative, no ecstasy from her. Now were really pissed and then a couple minutes later another close friend calls to see what we r up to that night. We let him know our situation and he tells us he can get us some mollies in an hour guaranteed!!!!! he tells us to meet him at a park close by and we wait a little at another park(found a big bouncy ball there and we started kicking it around like dumbasses). 11:00 we meet him and hes got it! 11:30 we take the pills, we all took one each at that time. and head to Sandy's, a beach on the other side of the island. We arrive there around 12:10 and i need to piss bad! none of us are feeling the molly yet so we decide to roll a j, i roll it up and finally get to piss. after that we lit that fatty up and i needed to piss again. went to piss and when i came back and sat down in the passenger seat i looked at the waves in the water and the whole world just flipped upside down AND a tsunami was coming!!! Thats when it first hit me and my legs were shaking and my eyes were rolling back, i couldnt even move i just wanted to swim in that upside down tsunami. then it just went away and i was back in reality and found myself screaming LOL. and my friends just laughing at me, but they let me enjoy my trip and supported me and listened to me talk for hours about shit even i dont remember. bob started feeling his roll too and he was our driver and he wanted to go drive around so we left on our way back to town. 

Now while i was sitting in the car i was trippin hard...i just felt good, really good, like my brain was having sex with another brain, a really hot brain. and i remember myself screaming and taking some deep ass breaths. now my memory blacks out on the way back to town but we arrived at the beach once again to smoke and met up with another friend who just wanted to smoke some weed. it was felling kinda chilly so i was telling everybody that i could really use a jacket right now and then bob pulls out a hoody from the back of the car and i just didnt know what to say. it was the happiest moment of my life!! i put that hoodie on, and i felt like spiderman when he turned into black spiderman, the black hoodie was just taking over my skin.

We walked down to our spot by the beach and laying on the ground was half a coconut tree kinda like a stump but not attached to the gound it was cut down and parellel to the ground, and i layed on top of it and hugged/dry-humped that motherfucker like i was making love to it. I was taking bong rips while still laying on it and would refuse to let go. ahahhaha it was around 2am when we finished and everyone wanted to leave but i just wanted to stay there with my new best friend, the tree, all night and just hug. eventually i realized how stupid i looked and got up and followed them back. still feeling realllly good we sat in the car and listened to music for 20 mins then decided to pick up more rolls. my other friends usually take more than one in a night so i said fuck it, lets go get some more. we had to drive out about 20 miles to go get them and when we were almost there my friend says, where are we goin? and at that point we all just burst out laughing. apparently he got a text when we first got on the freeway saying, dont go that far to meet up with the dealer cuz they were back in town(waikiki) again but he forgot to tell us about the text. so we drive back to waikiki and finally get the mollies and i got one more, idk how much everyone else got. now its around 320am and i start getiing calls from my parents said i have to get home UHOH. so on the way home i take the molly(BIG MISTAKE) 330am and get inside and go to my room. feeling fucking AWESOME and get my headphones out and start to listen to my techno/light dubstep playlist. Cant sleep so i get up and start dancing/fistpumping, i guess i was making a lot of noise cuz i woke my parents and i look to my right and my dads just standing there like, WTF? its 430 in the morning!! so i say im goin to sleep and as soon as he leaves turn off the lights and trun on some porn! lol. watched that shit for 3 hours and it was like i was in the porno and holy shit!!! is all i can say. after that had a normal sunday chillen at home but was feeling it up until around 3pm then i went to sleep at 4. knocked out until monday morning.

anyways thats my first trip and glad i was wit friends cuz idk what id have done if by myslef or at a rave. ahahha i want to see more posts like this on here...If u guys can remember.cuz my other two times were at parties. And thanks for reading.

When I received them, I grabbed one pill, took a knife and did a terrible job cutting a quarter off of it. The part I cut up became a fine powder basically. So I took what was roughly 3/4 of the pill, so I'd estimate it to be at about 160mg. When I rolled, I really liked it, and I definitely didn't feel like it was too much. It was very manageable and I had a great time.

For my second time, I'm considering taking a whole pill because 160mg was pretty good, but I definitely thought it could be stepped up a notch. But after doing some research [people seem to be advising against taking a whole pill.](http://www.reddit.com/r/MDMA/comments/1enbdy/pill_dose/) Some people are saying that half a pill would knock a person on their ass, and yet when I took 3/4 of a pill I was dancing fine and had a great time rolling. The general consensus on this subreddit also seems to be that ~220mg is kind of a high dose. I'm a fairly big dude (6' 2"", 220lbs), so is it possible that I would have a higher tolerance to MDMA? I also load up on supplements before, during, and after my rolls, make sure to stay hydrated, etc. (I like to think I'm a responsible drug user).

So my three questions are:

1. How the hell do I cut a pill without destroying it? My kitchen knife disintegrated a quarter of the pill.

2. Does MDMA's potency vary depending on the size of the person?

3. If I was fine taking 3/4 of a 220mg pill, would I be fine taking a whole one? Or is that dangerous/stupid/etc.? I've pondered taking 3/4 of a pill and then redosing with the last quarter an hour in, but I've heard that redosing is more neurotoxic and won't hit as hard. And if I were to take the whole pill and find that 220mg is more than I can handle, what is rolling too hard like?

I did not go much further than this as I do not abuse drugs in the sense of addiction, I use them responsibly.

The first time I rolled I was at a concert, I ended up panicking from the anxiety I felt, it was like everything was suddenly shut out, my hearing was gone and it was only me in a room filled with hundreds. I also felt like I was going to get lost really easily.  So I sat in a corner trying to get over the anxiety but eventually retreated home where I then had an amazing experience just talking to my boyfriend(also being in the car felt amazing). The anxiety at the concert kind of imprinted and at every concert I went to afterwards I would get super anxious and want to go home.

Second time, I took it at home, seeing if I could get over the anxiety. I was utterly calm and completely comfortable, no anxiety whatsoever. I ended up talking to my best friend of six years for hours on end about everything. Time flew by and it was a lovely experience, I felt so purely myself with no worries and no outside factors changing me in any way and I honestly couldn't wait to take it again. 

I'm sure the kinds of pills I took makes a difference, the first time was a pure white sort of pearly fine powder, the second was a chunkier brown. 

Now this Friday, one of the last electronic concerts in my area for the summer is happening, and I'd really like to roll at it, but I'm afraid I'm going to panic again. I loved everything about my experience at home. So any advice on how to deal with that initial anxiety would be tremendously appreciated.

I have both a story AND some questions.

I've taken mandy three times, twice from street dealers. Both powders and both times it was OK. I clenched my jaw, felt pretty damn good and said many 'I love you, bro's.

Suddenly, Mortal Kombats off SilkRoad with two of my friends. Jesus H Cox I rolled. Properly. I had wigglevision, (now I know why it's called rolling: I could feel my eyes rolling back into my head casually during conversation and I admit it felt pretty cool XD), I devised 'fake chewing gum' to help ease how hard I clenched my jaw and my heart rate went up like a lift on crack.

Now here are the questions, if you guys would be kind enough to help. I am perfectly capable of voluntarily sitting very still in one place and not saying a word whilst rolling (not that I did, but I can). I enjoy this as much as getting up and being active. Is this weird?

Me and friends (J and V for simplicity) took 1.3 pills each. I was fine and we spaced the pieces out quite well. Whereas J has rolled many times, V has rolled only once before and started tripping towards the end of the session. Started seeing faces in J's RockBand drumset and had to physically get up, move it and have a short conversation with it. I was quite perplexed but J reassured me it's all good and that the best course of action would be to just play along until it was cool. Is this appropriate? V rolled for about 3 hours after me and J were on the way down (smoking some grade of course! I enjoy smoking during the come-up as well as I find it very, very cool that the sensation of the smoke is almost non-existent) and he later admitted that he felt like he was stuck in his roll. He fell asleep like a boss though.

Cheers guys, feel free to ask any questions as this time rolling was one of the best nights of my life :D

A) Going to make my own caps with a mg scale with a simple math ratio to start going down 10mg each time. So since 170 was too much, now I'm going to try 155mg/160mg next. (Doing this since I have too many high rated mdma pills)

B) Going to take heavy dosed pills and just take half then redose the other half at come up/peak.

1363739709.0,6,self.MDMA,1amqej,"First time user on Saturday, and I still feel fucked up after a crazy weekend story...",6,0,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/MDMA/comments/1amqej/first_time_user_on_saturday_and_i_still_feel/,"Ok, so Saturday night was the first time I used MDMA.  I was with a friend who also sold, and after enough convincing, I said wtf and I did it.  But..since I was not really a big drug user in the past , and I do take regular meds, it always worried me about something happening, so I started with just half a pill.  Don't ask me the mg because I have no idea.  There were was a blue, green, and a red pill.  He gave me half of the green, and I gave me another half if I wanted it later

One of the reasons I took it was because we were going to a club downtown (Chicago).  My friend is actually a major player at this club and so its always fun to go down there regardless.  

Anyways, we drove down there with my friends faience and her sister.  It was the sisters first time as well, except that she started feeling really shitty in the car, so the faience and her sister ended up just dropping us off and going back home, which made the night a lot more fun.

It seemed to do a little something but not much, so when we walked in I took the other half.  My friend being a name down there had a lot of REALLY hot women come up to him, and having the MDMA to sell def helped a ton as well.  
I actually become a center of attention at times since, my friend was telling people that it was my first time, and so everyone kept asking me how I was doing.  Mainly girls, which was nice. 

I eventually got another one from my friend and then I start feeling REALLY HAPPY.  I feel like I had never been so fucking happy and just enjoying myself.  Unfortunatly it did not help me get any women at the club, but then again , we were only there for an hour or so , and we had gotten there late anyways.

So after my friend made some money and the club closed down we decided to take a cab, to think about where to go next, not to go someplace , to think.  I explained to my friend how stupid that was and what a waste of money, but he did not care.

We ended taking the cab to a Diner to chill out for a few and wake up some.  My friend kept falling asleep in the cab, and in the diner.  I made him drink a ton of coffee and  smacked him whenever he tried to doze off.  I actually had to walk across the street to buy a fucking phone charger for his iphone because he didn't fuckin charge it, and we needed his contacts.

We ended up deciding to meet up with this chick in the suburbs.  So we took a 45 min cab drive  from the city to his Fiance's place to grab my car to drive to her place.  She worked the grave yard shift at some place and got off of work at 6am.    I don't think we got to her place until 7 or 8 , but I can't fully remember.

This chick was something else. I had never met her before, but my friend had when he and a different friend picked her up at a bar and took her to a hotel.  She blew both of them and they gave her MDMA.  She is a girl that likes to party(obviously) She was staying at her brothers place because apparently she had broken up with her boyfriend in Dallas and needed a place to stay and a job.

This girl was all about partying and and doing MDMA. She was not someone who looked COMPLETELY messes up or something.  She was actually a very cool person, and I was mesmerized!  She was a smart person and had the look of someone who had been through a lot in life.  She was really pretty, but did have some curves, not HUGE , but not unnoticeable either.   

So we picked her up and checked in at a hotel to stay.  Now I am not a person that likes to be around other guys when sex with a girl is around, but my friend is a crazy freak who doesn't mind that shit.  I had to draw the line and tell him to fuck off with that shit.

Anyways, my friend ended up passing out really quickly while me and her stayed up talking, a lot.  It felt like I was in love with her, even though some of her curves kind of through me off.  Something about her being pretty, mysterious , and experienced really turned me on.  It was also weird at the same time, because she seemed to look different every time I looked at her, because of the lighting , or something else.  Kind of like that Seinfeld episode! 

And of course I had no fucking insecurity because of the MDMA.  It really felt like we were connecting.  Enough that I went straight to just straight up asking her if she wanted to ""fool around""  probably the lamest thing you can ever say to a women, which of course she made fun of me for.  But it did not deter me at all.  We were talking for a few hours and while my friend was asleep, which was fucking great.  

But after awhile she wanted another pill, and to do that we had to wake my friend up.  Which I did not want to do, but she did.  So she ended up waking him up.  He said he was going to charge her, so I told him it I would pay for it, as well as another one for me.

The rest of the day got kind of crappy now that my friend was up.  there was no privacy, and even when it was just me and her talking, or me showing her some stuff on her laptop, the dude just had to fuckin but in and fucking say something.  Maybe I was being selfish?  Or maybe the dude has a fucking ego and can't let other people do things with out him being involved.  

There was nothing else that really happened in the hotel, which sucked...I don't smoke, but my friend and the girl did.  Apparently a little bit before we were left, they went to go have a smoke downstairs, and my friend asked her if she would by DOWN for doing stuff with me upstairs and she said she was.  Now, since it had been a LONG time since I had charged my phone, I had decided to turn it off and save some battery.  What I didn't know was that my friend had sent me texts saying that she was down, but I had to make a move!  Which of course I did not see until we dropped her back off at home at around 530pm.  

The more I had thought about it, the more I realized that the second day at the hotel was way over kill and a waste of money.  And was actually really depressing. I had only gone outside once the whole time we were there from maybe 9 or 10 am to 5pm.

Anyways, I dropped her off and then my friend and then I drove home.  I had never wanted to get home so fucking bad, I was still fucking somewhat messed up. Also keep in mind that I had not slept at any point during this story. 

I got home and crashed for two hours, then woke up.  I texted her to see how she was, and she responded back to me that she feels like crap , but that she was out drinking.  We had a little more back and forth , and I told her we should do it again some time, and she agreed.  (Just me and her obviously)

I could not fall asleep until around one and I had to get up for work around 730.  Work REALLY sucked, and it REALLY sucked today as well.  Infact I went from Super Fucking happy at the club , to progressively depressed after.  In fact today I feel utterly depressed.  I hate my job, my life , most things about myself, being stuck where I am in life because of not making sacrifices, and I STILL FEEL effects of the pill.  Like it has not worn off completely yet.

I think I made the mistake of taking way too much for my first time.  But work was a mess for me yesterday and today, I felt like I just wanted to brake down and collapse.  Yesterday I kept thinking of the girl, I sent her a few texts today, but never got a response....  I suck with women, so I am not sure how to play it at this point.  My fascinating with her is also fading.

Anyways, thats my story. 

Also, this sub reddit has really helped me understand a lot of things that I went through

Is there any other ways to make a air tight seal?

Is there even any better way to get it across state lines? Is this something that say drug dogs or anything can smell? I find that kinda hard to see... But dog's senses of smell are amazing, so its not outside the realm of possibility.

I was hoping to try MDMA for the first time this afternoon. I have never really done any recreational drugs before (alcohol aside, ha) -- I've tried both smoking and eating weed before with very little effect (any advice on this also appreciated!) I'm not going to a rave or anything, just wanted to try it in my house with my boyfriend.

I bought it a friend (not a dealer) who thought it was ""molly"" and had used same the batch with five friends recently and said that everyone got high/had a good time. [Here's what](http://i.imgur.com/l7bpUJf.jpg) [it looked like!](http://i.imgur.com/ti7qAXT.jpg)

Anyways, I bought the marquis reagent and tested it this morning, and it immediately turned bright yellow and then darkened into a deeper amber color. So, not MDMA. 

The color wheel that came with my test said that this meant it could be: Naphyrone, Butylone, Methylone, MDPV, or MDPPP.

...From searching this subreddit it seems most likely that it's Methylone, right? Is Methylone generally safe/provides a fun experience?

I'm jittery since it's my first time, so any perspective would be really helpful! Thank you :)

**UPDATE**: I tried it, and had a good experience. I don't know what MDMA feels like so I can't compare, but on the methylone I felt extremely emotionally open, at peace, happy and ""in the moment"". I was able to have discussions about difficult stuff that I wouldn't have been able to do otherwise. I wouldn't quite describe it as ""euphoric"" (except when I was on a swingset briefly... whoa!) but a very good experience none the less, and the comedown was very mild.

Next day we had an awesome time with some afterglows. There were some beer left in a glass where some other friend had poured his dose last night but didn't finish it. At around 19:00 my friend drank two small sips of this beer out of curiosity just to check the taste (yeah, foul taste).

I'm mentioning this in case someone find it relevant, but she didn't feel any effects from this two sips, and we continued chilling out and feeling some afterglows for a few hours.

Between 22:00 and 23:00 we were in bed and she started to feel some muscular pain in her legs. She'll be having her period soon, so she thought that might be it. 

Her temperature started rising shortly after (I could feel it under the sheets) so I took her temperature - she was 37.7º, which is high for her (normal temperature for her is &lt; 37º). Muscular pain got worse and she started to shiver. She took 1g of paracetamol at this point.

I monitored her temperature for the following hours every 30min, and it raised to 38.2º before it started dropping back progressively to 37.0º. All this over the course of three-four hours.

This morning she checked her temperature and it was 38º again.

Does this sound like something we should worry about? Other than fever (which for her always involves high temperature + muscular pain + shivers) she feels alright and she isn't showing any other symptoms.

I had my first experience with MDMA crystal about 3 weeks ago. Me and a friend were bored on a Thursday and decided to go out. Anyway after spending all night chain smoking cigs, drinking alcohol and about 300mg of  molly. I was up from around 12-9am the next morning which then followed the worst hangover ever. which weirdly lasted about 5 hours. (Some multi-vitamin tablets and fruit juice &amp; some mary jane.) I then proceeded to feel amazing for the rest of the week. They next Saturday comes along and i'm invited to a party after craving to try it again I buy some more. This time i start the night off with a couple of small lines around 100mg in total. From this I just felt all my inhibitions melt away and I felt free, loved up and just happy. Around 90 mins later I drop a 150mg bomb and 2 lines totaling up around 250mg. so in total I had taken 400mg. Now finally I started feeling amazing but the come up felt slow and it was now 1am when I peaked and stayed like that for a good few hours.  Around 6 in the morning is stared at the left over molly, while rocking an amazing afterglow and finished off what was left (200mg) silly i know. Anyway I took that last 200mg and it fueled me for the whole Sunday, I was calm, relaxed and happy. I had no problems then until Tuesday where I felt a little depressed but I had caught a cold anyway so could of been that.

In conclusion: No physical damage or mental problems present as yet. I have been severely depressed before and the comedown may cause depression but too me felt close to normal.

a friend of mine has been using MDMA for about a year and i wanted to experience it with him. we live in separate cities now but had arranged for me to visit whilst SBTRKT (a producer here in the UK) was playing in his city, the gig was a rather large rave where most people were on MDMA. Two weeks before the gig my Grandfather died and the Funeral was to be held the day before the gig, i decided that it would be a great shame to miss seeing my friend so arranged to still head down. 

anyway, to cut to the chase we waited until we were inside to drop, we bombed 0.25 grams (i'm not sure if this is a lot for my first time) and planned to top up if we weren't feeling it. the night was amazing and as i came up i had what was probably the best night of my life, topping up on what i had taken roughly three hours after dropping.

 but about four or five hours after the initial dose i started feeling very heavy and a pretty bad experience, i started to feel very paranoid (we had also smoked a couple of joints after dropping) and was frightened for my safety. i ended up asking my friend to take me home and he did. 

i was just looking to see if this is at all common with first time experiences or if it might have been to do with the circumstances or other contributing factors. i talked to my friend and we decided it might be a good idea to try taking a smaller dose next time and in a more familiar setting so i can get used to the feelings again. 

any help or comments would be greatly appreciated.

Here's my account.




- **Pre-loading** *2300hrs*. Started off with 1000mg of Vitamin C with 500mg of Magnesium capsules for a party of 5, including me. We avoided taking the  5-HTP because I heard it will actually lower the intensity.

- *0100hrs*. Dropped it like it's hot. A pill for his own.

- *0130hrs*. I can feel like it's coming up. But it's slow and smooth, I went around asking my mates and they said the same too. Shortly after this, cigarettes were smooth.

- *0200hrs*. The euphoria is there, but it's still slow and smooth and I know that something bigger is coming to our way. However, this is my first-time not to experience jaw-lock. I went around and my mates said no problem. Seems like the Magnesium are doing their job.

- *0230hrs*. Popped the second bomb right away. At this point of time, I was ensuring everyone is hydrated every 30 mins by letting them sip iced-cold water only. A friend told me he's having a great time and it was great not to have the jaw-clenching. Skin is dry, none of us are sweating despite the fact that we're dancing away to DNB.

- *0300hrs*. We leaved the club, but this was when I feel the highest state I ever felt with Ecstasy liked never before. It was exactly the same to how I would describe with Shrooms. Everything was wavy and I swear I couldn't walk straight out from the club. As soon we got out, we were discussing for our next plan. Then there was a tree opposite us with strobe lights hanging on it. It was fucking with my vision and I told my mates about it. The other 3 mates had shrooms experience and they thought the same too. Shortly after this, one of us vomited. It was just bile. Provided him with an isotonic drink and he felt better. We continued walking with the vision similar to shrooms but everything was euphoric and nothing panicky or paranoid compared to shrooms in high dosage. My speech was stuttering. 

- *0400hrs*. Reached our friends apartment by foot. I asked if anyone is getting the downs but no one is experiencing it. Seems like we're still in the roll. A friend decided to DJ with his laptop on. My visions had subside and there's no 'wavy' paths. It was back to euphoria state. Feels good man. I really couldn't feel any downs nor any jaw-clenching at all. It was all good times. However, I gave a 100mg of 5-HTP to the friend that vomited earlier on. One of them is experiencing jaw-clenching but he said it was manageable. I noticed another friend of mine, who is a frequent starts to play with this tongue and doing all the jaw-clenching. The room was set to a temperature of 18 degrees Celsius. I have never felt this good with Ecstasy in this setting.

- *0600hrs*. I can feel like it's coming down very, very, very slow but at the same time, I'm feeling all good and was chatty unlike other times with Ecstasy. Joints were passed to the left at the same time. Hunger striked me. I finished a bar of Muesli down with some grapes and water. Actually, I was unsure if it's actually really coming down or not because some songs hits back right in. A friend decided not to eat because he wasn't hungry and he said the roll is still in him. We had great conversations unlike before and we thought the pre-loading supplements may have played their role decent enough.

After this point of time, everyone took a shower to freshen up. I spent like 30 mins dancing in the toilet alone. Gave everyone their dose of 1000mg of Vitamin C, 500mg of Magnesium and 100mg of 5-HTP at around noon. We had lunch and it seems like that friend of mine who is frequent is still playing with his jaw close to 1500hrs the following day. Everyone left the apartment at 1700hrs and I'm glad to say that this is my first time experiencing MDMA without jaw-clench, teeth grinding nor any downs at all. I will not claim that it has to be the herb because even with herb on previous sessions, I still do the jaw-clench. Anyways, no one is feeling the down when we departed to our own ways.

A coupea days ago I bought a few Blue Defqons for this weekend. I'm aware that these pills contain a high amount of MDMA, which is why I don't want to take 1 whole pill in 1 go. That might be a little bit too much for me. 

Now I decided that I'm going with half a pill, add another quarter after 30 mins and if I'm going good, add the last quarter 30-45 mins after that. Or I'll take 3/4th in 1 go and save the last quarter for an hour later. I feel comfy with this. (Im about 1.80 and weigh about 90kg)

That got me thinking, its not very clever to start deviding them in halves/quarters when I am there so I wanted to do this beforehand, at home.

Which simply got me wondering: Will this ruin the pills? Can it make them less powerfull when I devide them in quarters a few hours before I leave? 

Also, unrelated to this question, but related to the topic. Is it true that when I drop a whole pill in 1 go, the ""magic"" feeling will stay longer than when I drop half a pill and say an hour later I drop the other half?

I'm an 18 year old guy from Amsterdam and three days ago I did half a red defqon about 30 minutes before I went in to a big dubstep party with some friends, after an hour inside I took the other half because I still felt nothing, half an hour after that (2 hours total)  I suddenly started to feel a bit tired and I was just standing at the side of the dancefloor kind of falling asleep kind of feeling that I lost control of my body, my friends kept pulling me to the dancefloor and places but I didn't like getting touched and just told them to leave me the fuck alone and let me chill on my own. I felt kinda bad and I didn't feel like partying at all. I thought to myself this is the last time I ever do this because this sucks. I think I had this feeling for not even 5 minutes and all of a sudden I was like fuck it, I'm wasting my time I'm just gonna dance. I can't even remember the moment when I realized it kicked in but next moment I knew I was partying like I never did before. I couldn't believe it, it was the best feeling I ever had. And I'm certainly going to do it again next month.


But what I was wondering was why it took 2 hours for me to notice something while according to my friends it would take 30-60 minutes

I also wondered if this feeling of ""not wanting to party"" will also be there before the real thing kicks in every time or was that just a newbie feeling?

Thanks in advance!

tl;dr
Why did it take 2 hours to feel something and will it always take me 2 hours?
Will I always get into this ""sad"" mood before I feel the real thing?

Erowid says that 200+mg is a heavy dosage, but how do you find a good level to be at?
I have taken 3 capsules which I feel were good quality and had an excellent roll (2 capsules to start, 1 capsule after an hour). But was that a ""heavy"" experience because I had 3 capsules? I know I have no way of knowing how much was in each capsule but shouldn't one assume it's around 75-100mg? It's just hard for me to judge how my roll was compared to if I took less or more MDMA. 

If that was the case then I dosed around 250-300mg of MDMA.

My main concern is that I have 3 capsules right now and I don't know if I should dose all 3 like last time (this is a different batch) or just do 2 and see where it goes.

The subject would dose probably about 3-4 hours after the workout with approximately 200mgs of Molly.  Lets say the workout would consist of:

-5sets/5reps bench press
-3sets/8reps incline press
-3sets/8reps decline press
-3sets/8reps tricep pull downs
-3sets/8reps shoulder press
-3sets/20reps bicep curls

Furthermore, the act of cooking meth is extremely dangerous to the cooks health, whereas cooking MDMA is not... so why is it that it has become common practice for all rolls to be cut with meth? Any perspective from people who might know the business would be appreciated. I'm just a curious raver who would like know why it is literally impossible to get pure MDMA.

2) Is there any way to test purity percentages? The Marquis Reagent tests are great and all but if you read the fine print they tell you that they just see if there is MDMA in a substance, not how much.

3) Finally, I was wondering if anyone has gotten pure MDMA direct from the source so to speak, and what that's like.

We had a gram between us.
So i go out for a cigarette because I'm a little nervous, he makes it into 4 bombs, 2 slightly smaller than the other 2.
I come back up and do the bomb with a glass of water.
After about 20 minutes, he's sitting there rubbing his legs and the armchair, breathing heavily, eyes wide open, grinning crazily. He's asking me if I can feel anything yet. I can't.
Note, I'm a lot bigger than him in size. Not height, but I'm about 5 stone heavier.
After about half hour, it hits me. I'm dancing around the room on the balls of my feet, having the time of my fucking life. Absolutely buzzing. Everything is awesome. I can't even explain how good I felt.
About an hour and a half in, my mate decides we should top up, so I do. Only problem is, I choke on the water/bomb. I throw up in the toilet. The next half hour (or what seems like 4 hours), is spent lying on my back in the bed, with my arms crossed over my chest, in a cold sweat, being scared for my life. Suicidal thoughts, bad things going through my mind. My mate is being so good, and trying to keep me calm, just stroking my hair haha. It did work. He is constantly telling me its gonna be alright and that I just need to remember its gonna end. I then get him to turn the music and lights off, and I lay there for another ten minutes. Then I come out of it and am full of energy and happiness again. He says it was weird that that happened, and I even asked my dad, who did it say....a couple of times in his youth haha. Even he said that was weird. I havent googled it that much, because it tends to be quite sorta...extreme opinions e.g. MDMA CAN KILL or the opposite. Just thought you guys might have some better advice thats less biased and more...honest.

I have a feeling there are probably many threads like this but wasn't really able to find any, which is why I thought I'd start this one. 

It's been approximately one month since I last took MDMA now. For the first couple of weeks afterwards I'm not bothered about the stuff at all, but it's now getting to the point where I'm absolutely itching to do it again. What gets me truly excited about rolling again is sharing this excitement with all you lovely people! Also I'd like to get some dosage ideas from you guys as I'm still kind of looking for my 'sweet spot'. 

So tell me:
1. When was your last roll?
2. When will your next roll be?
3. Where will you be taking it? What setting?
4. What and how much will you be taking?
5. What will your dosage schedule be?

I'll go first:
1. Last time taking MDMA was a little over a month ago at a music festival
2. Approximately one month from now 
3. At a legendary techno event which is from 10pm to 8am. 
4. One tested pill of 200mg total (am female, 24, 140lbs). 
5. Not entirely sure yet. 120 + 80 1.5hrs later I presume?

If we do it after the concert, will the concert's prior excitement diminish the effects of the mdma? Because if so we'll probably just do it the day before.

thanks for the feedback guys. I was just a little worried that our serotonin would be depleted by the time we dropped.

1375589632.0,4,self.MDMA,1jnxf3,"Friend and I took ecstasy, she freaked out badly, experienced pure terror... never seen before. Anyone know anything about this kind of response?",6,2,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/MDMA/comments/1jnxf3/friend_and_i_took_ecstasy_she_freaked_out_badly/,"I recently acquired some pink hearts, from a new source. She had never rolled before, but had Adderall and Molly in the past with me, so my logical conclusion was that it would be fine. I’ve had E for years, every four-five months tops, and everyone I’ve done it with has reacted the same as I.

Anyways, she wants to watch how I react first, which is reasonable. I take it at 10:45pm at my apartment, and 30 minutes later start feeling the lifting body high flush sensation. It felt weirder than usual, and scared me for maybe a minute tops before I became adjusted and felt the love waves hit me like usual. It feels great, though the speed rush hits me hard enough to make me vomit some phlegm (been an issue the past few days, so I’m not surprised), and then things are peaking beautifully. She breaks the heart into four pieces, and takes a tiny piece at 11:46pm. She feels a tiny bit of something, takes a second tiny piece at midnight, then a third small piece at 12:34. I looked at the dose after everything chilled out, and there was still a third of the pill left over, so she didn’t take a full pill or even a full ¾.

She noticed little effects, but didn’t start really feeling it until 1am, where she does the first-roller-couch-hug, feeling up the carpet/cat/everything and enjoying the textures, the whole feelsgoodman.jpg deal. I’m happy, she’s in bliss, and we’re listening to music and everything’s solid… until about fifteen-twenty minutes later, when she starts to get quiet and upset. Things seem to be becoming too much for her, and she says that she wants it to stop. It stopped being fun and enjoyable, and she started panicking, panting, sweating, and saying her hands are numb and becoming upset. It seemed like the speed was way too much for her, as she stated she kept getting blasted up. When she got “launched”, she screamed. It was more than just that, though – it was a massive amount of fear that swelled inside her chest, and screaming was the only way she could release it.

Like, she’s rocking back and forth clutching herself with white knuckles, screaming and making rhythmic grunting/yelling sounds. This would last a few minutes non-stop, and then she’d get a calm for a minute or two and state that she couldn’t control it, that she screamed because it helped alleviate the pressure in her chest (? It looked like she was pointing near where the collarbones connect to the rib cage?). This went on for an hour, with me holding her and trying to soothe her as best I can while she constantly asks questions and says things, like “I’m going to die” “OMG” “My body is rejecting it” “Am I going to be this way forever?” “You’re sure I’m going to be okay?” “Omg” “MAKE IT STOP!” “HOW LONG IS THIS GOING TO LAST?”, trying to cry but being unable to get any tears out, digging her claws into me and trying to grind her fist against the wall “to feel pain”. Said she was scared, described it later on as “pure terror”.

I can’t go anywhere to try to get something that could help her. I ask if she can stand up, because sometimes walking around has helped me adjust to the effects, so I try to tell her I can make her some tea to help, but she refuses to move from where she’s planted on the futon and begs me to not leave her. I have to go use the restroom, and she’s calling my name in desperation. I tell her she can take this GABA/L-Theanine relaxation pill to help, but she doesn’t want to “take anything else”. There was no solution I could provide. Eventually I managed to get her into the living room so I could make some tea in the kitchen, but she’s grabbing my arm and trying to pull me back. I go into the kitchen, and she slams herself into the ground in the living room, clawing at the carpet, slamming her body into walls, an exhibition close to madness. 

She eventually went to use the restroom for the first time since she’d been taking it, which I’d been asking her to do for a while as she was drinking an insane amount of water while she was having her one-hour-long massive panic attack (if you can call it that?), and she seemed a little better. Tea is ready, and at this point she’s no longer screaming, but is pacing around the entire apartment very quickly, constantly, and doesn’t stop for another half-hour to an hour, during which she slowly calms down. We determined that when she started pacing was when she “plateaud” and wasn’t getting another speed boost, which is why she was able to maintain some control. 

After this half-hour to an hour of her pacing around, she finally sits down, and seems to slowly be getting a little better, but is clearly very much traumatized by the event. We rested a few hours later for a few hours, and she still felt weird and energized/pacey, but not where it was before. The next day, she woke up from six hours of sleep with a massive energy buzz and a panic attack, and was pacing from 8am-3pm with her eyes dilated again, and then paced once more at 6pm when others came home. What? The second day of being sober, halfway through, her anxiety attacks stopped happening, but even on this third day she still woke up with a racing heart. She had the fright hit her the following days, too, where the “feeling of terror would flood my chest and sometimes extend to my head or hands”.

I’ve never, ever known someone to experience such a traumatic and damaging experience from Ecstasy. I’ve known people who had bad experiences where they threw up for a few hours due to taking two-three pills, and I’ve known people who had bad experiences because they decided massive drug cocktails were a good idea, but I’ve never known anyone to have such a severe reaction from 2/3 of a pill.

Two things to note, the first being something I hadn’t considered beforehand – she has anxiety issues. It may be a disorder, but it hasn’t been officially declared. So, it may be that it peeled off layers of protection against panic attacks. But, that’s a complete guess from me. The second thing is that she isn’t on medication – that means she didn’t take any SSRIs or MAOIs, pain medication, etc. This has left a scar on her, a scar which could take a while to heal, and I feel terrible for putting her in this situation – but I have never heard of/seen such a violent and opposite response to it, so I’d like to know if anyone else has any idea of what may have been going on or knows someone/experienced something similar.

EDIT

I could never find these on any pill report website, but I figure I may as well post the pic of the pills here, just in case anyone recognizes it. I'm in the tri-state NY/NJ/DE area of NE coast US.

On the other hand I have found fewer reports on using Noopept. However, from what I have read the roll is MASSIVELY more enjoyable - one that surpasses that of Piracetam.

I'm trying to stick to the 2-3 month rule. From what I understand, your serotonin is fully replenished within that time.

As you can see the crystals fizzed and turned a more vivid yellow whilst the liquid coming off them was black. Anyone know anything about this?

Ive had a couple serious relationships before, and I think I have been in love (only 19 so not sure) and nothing ever felt this bad.

Is this something anyone else has gone through, or knows about? Keep in mind ive only known her for about a week, so I doubt that these feelings are real.

Sorry if there is a wall of text btw and grammar/spelling..

9:10pm- Took .15 84% pure MDMA (""brown sugar"" from SR). I crushed it up and put it in a little bit of water then shook the bottle and began to drink it. Now i played the waiting game.

Aprox. 9:25pm- The come up was chilling nothing i couldnt handle typical lights getting brighter and music sounds great couldnt really focus on conversation, i was sitting down with a friend but what happened next i DID NOT expect AT ALL, i had rolled before but never experienced anything like what i did last night, its as if i was shot out of a rocket and a huge wave crashed over me of warmth that was extremely intense and i kept riding that wave. i could even describe it like an explosion of warmth through out my body. I then couldnt sit up right any more and put my hands on me head but all i could say was ""WOOOOW OH MY GOD"" i felt like i couldnt breath for about 30 seconds but i told my self to calm down youll be fine because it was only the drugs, i also got a sort of tunnel vision and everything got black im not sure if that was the drugs or my body going into a kind of shocked state. i asked my friend to bring me my gatorade took a sip and calmed down a little but i was still panicking  a tad so i walked somehow to my friends bed with my friends close behind making sure i didnt fall then i flopped on the bed trying my hardest to respond but i couldnt. i heard what people were saying but it sounded muffled as if someone had put i cup to my ear along with a ringing noise that didnt last to long though. my friend handed me a bowl of weed and took a hit which definitely leveled me out and felt much better. got lots of eye wiggles so it was a little difficult to walk. i then began to enjoy my night with all of my friends hugging, talking and just hanging out with them. head massages are the best. I was on that bed for a little over 2 hours not sure why, i was happy in that room, it was beach themed so it was super relaxing, i didnt want to move at all, that shit floored me i guess you can say. I finally got up and was enjoying everyones company talking to them, got some bad vibes from some of them sadly :/ 

aprox. 12:30am- By this time i started to come down still feeling some of the effects but obviously not as much. the come down was EXTREMELY clean and smooth not a huge crash like ive had in the past where i felt like complete shit where it was similar to having the flu. i just felt exhausted this time. the whole trip lasted about 5 hours

approx. 3:00 am- i finally fell asleep completely since everyone had left. 

approx. 11:00 am- woke up still feeling tired and a slight headache which couldve been from sleeping wrong and just basking in the after glow, everything also feels dreamlike-ish after waking up.

TL;DR: Had a great time, and intense come up, the whole experience over all was AMAZING definitely nothing like anything else ive taken, i loved it. Need to fix the dosage though.

*DISCLAIMER* use some caution with pure MDMA, if youre not ready for something intense or are prone to panic attacks it can freak you out.

1373846049.0,2,self.MDMA,1iaztv,Escaping the old me. Looking for some different advice for my first time rolling.,4,2,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/MDMA/comments/1iaztv/escaping_the_old_me_looking_for_some_different/,"So as you read from the title I’m nearing the time of my first roll (super excited).  Although I have done extensive research about this magnificent drug I still need some strange advice.  While I feel this may be the wrong sub for the advice I’m looking for it may be the most beneficial since the experience with MDMA here is superior. 


So a little back story, I’m a very shy person have been pretty much for the extent of my whole life besides when I was a little kid and didn’t have a care in the world.  Even being this shy person I am I still lust for social interactions, although generally regret doing so after never having much to contribute to conversations.  I try to use alcohol for its social ‘lubricant’… which helps since I don’t feel social anxiety, but I’ve found myself still not having much to say or contribute to conversations.  I almost feel like I’m not necessarily a shy person anymore, I just have had this persona for so long that it’s hard to expand past it being as I don’t do much else besides little things by myself.  


So my question to you lovely people is should I even worry about what I need to talk about during the experience or will this just completely open up a new side of me.  I really want to take full advantage of every social situation I may encounter so I’m curious to what I could possibly have at my disposal for deep discussions and just simple talking to people.  I’ll be at a music festival with only one person I’ve known for a few years, so I may be running into new people (hopefully (: ) or be talking to my friend.
It may seem like a bizarre question but I really would like to take away from this experience completely since it could potentially be such an eye opener.  It may be quite some time before I get invited to something like this again.


I understand that it is a drug and it’ll be just an altered state of mind but I really want to reflect back on this and change the way I am, because I don’t know how much longer I can take wanting genuine social interactions without being able to actually partake in them.  


Thank you for reading, any experience/advice would be greatly appreciated.

Much love!

ps: apologizes if this may be better off posted in /r/socialskills, but I feel this sub may have firsthand experience with no judgement.

At EDC a few weeks back I took this capsule of sand-colored powder which I thought was MDMA but did NOT affect me the way that I am used to. I only took one but the high that it gave me was seriously intense; not enjoyable though. I was disoriented; didn't feel comfortable sitting, standing, walking around and especially not dancing. It was fucked. It was over pretty quick but definitely scared me out of finding any more drugs that night. Anyways.
The next night I was with a group of people I'd met the previous night (actually as a result of taking that capsule - everything happens for a reason). They offered me some of their M, which they seemed to be enjoying thoroughly.
I took two of what they had. NOTHING happened to me the entire night, despite them looking like they were rolling their brains out.
I shrugged it off as their shit being bad, but I am now back home and went to a show this past weekend and took two capsules of the stuff I have been taking this past year - the stuff I know works - and it hardly did anything.

Is it possible that the capsule I took the first night at EDC somehow, like, changed something in my brain?

To get started I want to give a little background about me. I am a teenage male, really active with crossfit (weightlifting,sprinting,fast intense workouts) who is new to substances. I have been overweight until about a year ago where I lost over 30 pounds, but I still have confidence issues.  I have been smoking weed for just about a year on and off and have had a somewhat high tolerance than compared to all of my friends. My highs don't last as long and aren't as intense unless I smoke continuously. 
I just started drinking and have a tolerance with that as well for never doing it before. Anyways it's annoying. 

Now to my first experience rolling at my first rave/music festival 

I first tried ""molly"" when I was at ultra this year. I had met up with a guy  (ill call him zack) i new from my town and bought two pills then left to hang out with my friend (ill call him jimmy) It was Saturday around noon and I popped my first pill at the trap/bass stage. I first started feeling it around an hour and twenty minutes later. Suddenly music sounded better, I talked more, and wasn't caring about what people thought (started dancing). It lasted for about an hour and then I went back to feeling normal. I was worried that I bought fake pill and talked to my friend Jimmy about it and he said it was probably my tolerance. 

Fast forward to about 10:30. At this point I took the other pill at 6 and felt the same moderate high. Finally me and Jimmy met up with his friend Kate who was from Miami and had connections. She gave us capsules and we took them and started to get ready for Deadmau5. An hour later they were telling me they were telling me that they were rolling and said not to worry I would feel it soon. Finally an hour later it hit me. I had my first good roll. Lights were amazing, sounds went through my whole body, I was dancing talking to everyone, just opening up and having a great time. 

Sunday
Next day I took pills from zack throughout the day that lacked the quality I had the night before so I stopped. Went and saw Snoop Dogg perform and managed to snag a joint for a couple hits. After this I met up with Kate and Jimmy at knife party took a hard pill then left to get ready for the final performance from Swedish House Mafia. An hour had passed since I took the last one and everyone was rolling but me. Kate said she wasn't gonna let me have a bad night so she gave me a double. This thing was Different to what id seen before. I clear capsule filled to the top with crystals. Thinking nothing of it I took this double then we went over to see the performance. 45 minutes after the double I started rolling with everyone. We had met some people and formed a group. At this time Kate and Jimmy were rolling hard and had to leave to rest for a bit. I stayed with my new friends having a moderate roll but still nothing like what everyone was talking about and we were all shocked. We all took the same stuff so it couldn't be bad quality. 

Second time. 
After ultra I stayed of Molly for three months till another one day festival. Over the course of 12 hours I took two spread out in the first six hours with no prevail then 2 at once then smoked a half joint within 30 minutes. Still a moderate roll but nothing crazy. 

4th of July 
Found a new dealer and took .3 orally with friends at the beach. Just had a chill roll. Talked a good bit but no body high or excitement as my two other friends. 

6th of July 
Found a new dealer who had some real ""fire"" Molly. Took .8 at once and had the same moderate to low roll that lasted an hour compared to friends who took .25 and lasted 2 and half hours. 

Overall I've had a variety of pills but none effecting me as much as my friends. 

I know I need to get a tester but it's hard because I still live at home. I'm planning on rolling in a month and want to have a incredible experience. 

If anyone has any ideas what's going on I'd love to know. I'd be stupid to think all of my stuff is pure MDMA but still shouldn't I roll as much as my friends? I mean .8 is less effective in me then .25 in my friends who rolled the same days as me?

TL;DR 
Have taken ""Molly"" at four separate occasions with friends and haven't had the same roll as friends and even took more at some points.

8:47 I start to roll harder than I ever have before even with a smaller dose. It was very strange usually it would take a little bit longer to get to the sweating part, but it skipped all the way there. I felt like I was getting hit by a train, but it was the softest train ever made.
I was also rolling with 2 of my roommates. We all took it at about the same time and we were rolling by the time I was up too. We all started to hug, cheer, scream a little, or shout. My one roommates was her first time. When I saw it hit her I could just tell how much she loved it.
I then proceeded to head to my friends house where my one roommate was dancing the whole time with me. Her and I also had to strip down to almost nothing because it was so hot feeling with the dancing and the no AC :(.
We then went back to my apartment and just chilled out for a while before heading to a party. During this whole time my other roommate was suppose to bike to the place I was at, but had a “cop” turn around and follow him while he was on his bike. He then ditched the bike and found a party with a bunch of really cool people. We then found him and stayed at the party for a few hours.

11:30 ish, the high hits me, it's calm at first, my body is tingly, colors are vibrant as fuck, my head starts spinning. I'm with a group of friend and were watching trippy videos on youtube.

1 am, i feel fucking amazing, hyper, alert, i really want to dance or run around. When i rub my pants my hand goes numb.

2 am we started a movie on netflix, stake land, i'm cuddling with a girl i've had a crush on for a while.

4 ish, the movie ends, i still feel euphoric, like nothing in the world is wrong.

5 we leave the house and go to a nearby park to see the sun rise, the colors are beautiful. We smoke some weed, the high gets more intense.

6:30, i've been tripping for about 7 hours and it's still not slowing down, i'm a little scared.

7:30 i get home, i'm high as a kite, i get on my computer and start coding random stuff to pass the time.

9am, the high is falling off a bit, so i go smoke a joint.

11 am, i have school in an hour and a half (yay exams) i'm still high, wtf is happening.

12:45, i get to class and sit down for the exam. I ace that fucker like a boss. My head is clear as crystal. I'm so focused.

2pm, i get home, i lay in my bed, i'm starting to feel drowsy, so i smoke a pipe bowl.

4pm, i head over to my friends house, i'm still rly high. I'm basically freaking out. My friend told me it would last 4 to 6 hours.

6pm, dinner time, i eat a bit of potatoes, some cucumber and salad. I puke it up 30 minutes later.

It's now 9:35 pm, i'm starting to come down, i'm feeling like shit, i just want to roll up into a ball and cry, i'm feeling depressed. I don't fucking like this. I don't want to do this, i'm on edge, i'm chain smoking, i don't even know why, it's not helping. I'm scared. I can't sleep, can't eat, i've drank 6 bottles of water in the last 2 hours. I wanna die. Never again. My brain is going a million miles a second but i can't focus, even typing this is making me nauseous.

Anyway, i'm feeling like shit, i'm going to try and sleep. I don't recommend this experience to anyone.

Edit1: it's 2 pm the following day, i just woke up so i'm a bit drowsy but i just had the most amazing licid dream of my life, so lucid that i actually woke up, was hallucinating, texted my friend and laid there with my eyes open for a few minutes before they hurt too much an i woke up.

The pill is 220mg, so I could half it and do save one half for a party that's coming up in a week or so.

I've only took MDMA once before and I had a great time, it was out on this mountain while it was very sunny. It was a much lower dosage. I'm not sure exactly how much, probably around 100mg or just under.

I'm looking to try out my first MDMA roll, and i have some questions. 

I've only tried THC(cannabis) before. I'm going to Holland this summer, for a semi big EDM festival. I've read a lot of things about MDMA, and i feel ready to try it out, as i have educated myself to do it as safely as possible. I've been to raves before.

My questions are: How will i know where to get it? -  and how can i know if it's secure MDMA, with no dangerous chemicals / substances? I of course have to buy a test kit(are those legal to have in posession btw?), but i have read the fact, that it cannot detect foreign substances.

This bothers me a lot, as i really want it to go smooth. As stated before, i am in a foreign country.

None of these hallucinations lasted for very long. It only happened when I stared at something or someone.

My friends faces began floating several feet above their bodies. This one was particularly interesting. Their faces were like ghosts, while their bodies remained solid.

Patterns on the ceiling formed into hippo shapes. These shapes began moving, like watching hippos dancing.

Glass panels started peeling off of plaster walls. This one was just wonderful.

In the corner of the room, I could see fish swimming around in the air.

The fire alarm kept moving to a different part of the ceiling.

I could see kaleidoscope patterns everywhere and my friends appeared to be wearing extremely colourful face paint.

I very much enjoyed these.

So I've been wondering about this a LOT lately.

Common knowledge tells us that MDMA causes neurotoxicity by flooding the Serotonine Axons in the brain  which affects our nervous system(amirite?). You basically deplete all of your Serotonine by using MDMA.

Now I've been reading up on how to make the neurotoxicity less severe, and feel free to call me stupid but I don't understand it. There's this substance called 5-HTP which should help your body with that and now I was reading something about 5-HTP and how it should NEVER EVER EVER be taken with another Serotonine booster... Because this can lead to Serotonine syndrome, which can lead to a coma. 

To me this instantly sounds like 5-HTP doesn't help you at all, no, instead it will make it more neurotoxic and increase your chances at getting a Serotonine syndrome? Yet, everyone says it's really good to take because it'll help your body recover MUCH faster after ingesting MDMA (even read a topic where someone suggested taking a cap a  few hours prior to dosing MDMA).

Can anyone please explain me why 5-HTP helps your body recover, and explain to me why 5-HTP before and or after MDMA doesn't increase neurotoxicity? And if it is good for your body after rolling, for how many days should you be taking it? And how much? (Actually saw this  right on the side of this subreddit as I was typing this;

•Antidepressants should never be taken with MDMA, it can cause Serotonin syndrome. If you are on any of these medications, it is wise to stop taking them for a few weeks before ingesting MDMA.)

... Isn't 5-HTP an antidepressant?

TL;DR many websites claim that 5-HTP helps your body recover, but because it's an antidepressant (and MDMA shouldn't be combined with antidepressants) shouldn't this increase the risk of neurotoxicity and Serotonine syndrome?

As for the other questions, my friends want to try 4FA at a festival, but the week before that we're already doing MDMA, I know this isn't the smartest thing to do. But what would be the best thing to reduce all risks? Aside from not taking it at all.

And last but not least, MDMA + LSD... what are the risks and do you guys have any experiences to share? If so, that'd be greatly appreciated! :)

There were a few variables, but googling them either didn't yield an answer or simply claimed that there should be no diminished effect.

•I didn't eat that morning, and didn't have anything all day, except a clif bar on the comedown (I didn't feel nauseous at all after either dose).

•I am on day 4 of a 5 day antibiotic, azithromycin, but I didn't take today's until the afternoon.

•I took 5-HTP before the Molly, and again a couple hours later.

•I did things to stimulate serotonin release, and there were times I know I felt something, but it was barely noticeable.

I'm bummed about it, and would love some advice on how to have a successful experience! Thanks in advance!

1) On the first night I will be attending a Macklemore concert and I was wondering whether I should take the pill(s) then or wait until one of the next nights. Of course it seemed to me that the concert would absolutely be the best time but upon reading through this subreddit as well as all of the information in the sidebar I began to have some doubts. Firstly, people have said that the 'hangover' can make you feel a bit down for a FEW DAYS after taking the E and I don't want to ruin the rest of my trip just for the first night. Also because it is a Macklemore concert it may not be that optimal. I know that all music will sound awesome but hip-hop is the one genre that never seems to be posted much in r/mdmazingmusic. Another point (I know there are a lot, I have thought about this quite a bit) is that at a concert I feel I wouldn't be able to have a proper conversation with my friends which is a big selling point to me on the actual Ecstasy. I am usually quite quite and don't open up much so I was thinking it would be nice get get a few things off my chest to people I can trust while on it. So what do you think? Should I take the E on the first night or another night when we will likely be at a house party?

2) As with a lot of the people who make these threads, the only other  illegal drug I have ever tried is weed and on my first time even that made me freak out for like 15 minuted until i acclimatized to the sensation. I have some problems with the loss of control that I felt and suffer from things such as claustrophobia because of it. However, when I drink, even a small amount, that tiny boost of confidence completely takes away my anxiety and I am fine. I have read that it is pretty common to feel stressed before and during the come up so I was wondering if having maybe 3 beers before hand would do too much damage to me. Obviously it will not help with the dehydration but I have a good friend who has agreed to look after me and monitor my water intake so that I don't over/under do it. What do you think?

Where would be a good place to take it if my main focus is getting rid of social anxiety? Is it better to be out in nature with just a few close friends to meditate/focus on myself?

I figured this may be achievable with a smaller dose. Usually I take a quarter of a gram and have an amazing time, but I'm clearly 'on something'.

So can you get a good effect from a smaller dose? Is it worth 'wasting' a precious time on this substance with a lower dose?

First of all I want to say that I really like this subreddit. I've rolled 2 times now. Both times were great. First time I took 3/4 pill (blue defqon). Didn't really seem to alter my state of mind, but I just had A LOT of energy. Second time was actually a week later already. Was drinking all night and at one point my drunk ass thought 'hey lets take some xtc'. Accidentally took a bit more than expected, but it was even greater than the first time (partyflock pills). But yeah, this was in november last year. 


But why i'm opening this topic is because I still have a few unanswered question. I've read quite a bit about the dangers of mdma usage and pre and post loading, etc. But most of it is just so 'abstract' for me...

For example articles that say that studies find that mdma changes certain pathways in rat brains....... okay, so? That doesn't sound good at all, but how dangerous is it really? What are the consequences? Will it give me alzheimer, depression, a running nose? How does it compare to a good night of drinking alcohol? And what if I use xtc once a month for the next 40 years, what will I be after all those year? A mentally retarded old man, or someone who is perfectly normal... And lastly, I'm 19, I'm still growing and my brain is still developing... does mdma interfere with those two things?

I know, I know, many questions. But I hope someone can take away my worries a bit :)

Since then I haven't looked back and honestly my drinking habit disappeared aside from social drinking and a bit of alcohol with dinner on special occasions and I have also quit smoking entirely (yes even weed). Aside from dropping 2-3 times a year that is it for me its just too good to fuck up. If anything E changed me from being an over stressed party bro douche to a compassionate caring man that enjoys working out and staying healthy. I decided the day after that I wasn't going to eat as much crap in my diet and take care of myself so that I could enjoy the rolls more. I think it helps but as to whether or not its scientifically true I have no clue.

Also if you want some crazy visuals definitely put the 3d Prizm glasses on while watching a stage. HO-LY. SHIT.

I also strongly suspect that I also suffer from depression and PTSD.

What I've found to help so far:

Romance. I don't have particularly string ties with my family or friends. The ones I do connect with are out of state and digital communication is my only way of keeping in touch. Having someone that I'm intimately connected with really, really helps me feel like I matter. However, I realize that it's not right or healthy to place responsibility for my happiness in the hands of others, especially those I love. It's also an irregular circumstance to find myself in. So while effective, it's not a readily available solution. I may find myself in one soon, but that's neither here nor there.

Lucid Dreaming. Usually, I feel very rested, and in a good mood the day after I've done this. However, It's also very irregular and despite my efforts, I haven't had that ""breakthrough"" where I can do it more often than not.

Marijuana. I've only started a month ago, and I've been so much more relaxed and in a better mood, I also have an overall increase in motivation. However, the effects are relatively short-lived, (I have to smoke every few days to stay ""up""), and it also stays in your system for a long time, whichever makes finding employment even more difficult than it already is.

Alcohol. the least effective thing on this list. It helps, but not in a positive way. Just kind of numbs everything and makes it easier to forget. Not to mention it's terrible for your body and you wake up feeling like shit.

What hasn't worked: 

Meds. They usually just make things worse.

Therapy. It's nice to talk about stuff, but I have trust issues. I see it more as a business meeting and less as an actual medical thing. As you can guess, this really limits its ability to be effective.

Cigarettes. Pretty obvious

Why I'm interested in MDMA:

I've heard a lot over the years about the positive long term effects of MDMA therapy. There are long periods of time between doses, and the drug doesn't stay in your system for long at all. Apparently, you also don't need that much to get the effects, so barring the acquisition of a Green Card and/or legalization of pot, it's much more affordable in the long term(?). Plus, the effects sound pretty fun, hahaha.

1) Take it when seeing Knife Party - the gig lasts ~8 hours, and tbh I'll need *something* to keep me going until it ends in the early hours. 

2) Take it when I see Skrillex, the week after - I expect I'll prefer this gig, and the lights show looks absolutely UNREAL - no doubt this is a better setting.

3) Take it at both. I've heard this isn't exactly the best idea (worse comedowns, less effect), but I wouldn't be taking it for a good few months after this.

Basically, the dilemma is: risk taking it twice, take it when I 'need' it, or take it when I'll have the best time.

I tested it with the Mecke, Marquis, and Simon's. All the reactions confirmed it contained MDMA or MDE.
It's very powdery, no big chunks or rocks.

http://imgur.com/mtGdZ

Does the consistency (chunks or all powder) have any affect on the purity? Is rocky mdma typically more pure than all powder? It seems it'd be easier to cut as an all powder substance. 


Test kits do not test for purity/strength and won't show all adulterants, just the main chemical, correct?


Another thing is the color. It is pure white. I've seen pictures of tan and white and anything in between and if i'm correct this has to do with the acetone wash, right?


When people say they are dosing 200mg, they have to be taking into account how pure they believe the powder is, because they could have 200mg of powder but perhaps only 100mg is actually MDMA. How do people determine how much to take if there is no easy way to know the purity? I want myself and my friends to dose safely.

I dosed 50mg first and experienced a 15-20 mins comeup where I felt uncomfortable, jittery, and anxious. However, after that period ended, I was very calm and peaceful. About half an hour later I dropped 100mg and only noticed a slight comeup from that. It was my first time ever rolling and ended up having an amazing night.
Even though I know it will go away, the comeup does scare me. So I decided to follow the same dosage schedule this past weekend. The molly was tested with Marquis and Mecke reagents and they both looked really good. It was in powder form, so I had no idea on the purity. I assumed that 150mg would be enough for a solid roll. I started off with 50mg first then dropped another 100mg half an hour later. I did notice a slight uncomfortable, nervous feeling when the first dose hit, but after it faded away I took 100mg more thinking that by the time this dose hit I would be alright. However, when the second dose hit, it was so overwhelmingly intense that I had to have my boyfriend take me to the back of the club to help calm me down. This feeling of anxiousness was so strong and did not go away for 45 mins or so. When it was most intense I was sweating profusely and was scared that I might pass out. My bf was able to calm me down and I was able to pull through until the feeling went away and I was then able to get back into the crowd. I seriously felt like I had went to hell and back. Once the really intense, long comeup went away I was able to have a good time and was rolling but not hard at all. Which makes me wonder why I had such an overwhelming comeup and then didn't even roll face? I did feel like if I had taken about 50mg more I might have been able to reach that spot, but it was already nearing the end of the event so I didn't want to take any more. 
I have only rolled four times. My first time is the only time that I rolled face and that was in mid-May. It wasn't tested but from the experience I believe that it may have been the purest molly that one could find nowadays. I felt like I was in another magical world. My second time was such shitty ""molly"" that I wasn't even rolling, which was in early Sept. My third time wasn't very good either and non-tested, which was a month later. I am assuming that it contained either a really small dose of mdma or was some other substance. I waited another month until rolling this past weekend and I thought I would finally be able to roll hard this time bc it was reagent tested... but I guess it was cut to the point where I had to take at least 200mg. But I am utterly confused as to why my comeup was so long and scary when there was less mdma and I didn't even end up rolling hard? I ate about two hours before dropping, so I was already a bit hungry when I dropped. I am not on any medications that could interfere with the drug. 
If it seems to be more of a problem with me than the purity of the molly I had, what are some things I could do to help lessen the comeup and strengthen the roll? Instead of taking 100mg after 50mg, should I take three 50mg doses spaced 30mins apart?",,False,self,t5_2qwvg,False,,,True,t3_132iy6,http://www.reddit.com/r/MDMA/comments/132iy6/unusually_long_very_intense_comeup/,

About half a year ago I consumed Ecstasy for the first time. (Pink Dove http://www.pillreports.com/index.php?page=display_pill&amp;id=13210) and it got me going for roughly 5 hours. It was pure magic, love and everything that comes with it in a pill. This was at a festival.

I wanted to retain that feeling at other festivals I would be going to into the future. So I did not use MDMA or any other stimulants until 2 weeks ago (4FA). We didnt know how to dose it properly, we ended up overdosing pretty bad but luckily nothing bad happened. (Off-topic; It's known to be less trippy as MDMA but like MDMA uses dopamine and serotonine... I doubted the serotonine because I only got really energetic and that was it..My friend however felt like god so trips appear to vary.) We dosed about 200mg each, whereas the reccomended dose is ~80-100mg.

Now last saturday I went to a rave, where I wanted to use MDMA. Eventhough the atmosphere (you know, the ""what are you looking at, wanna fight? kinda atmosphere) was pretty bad and some things were going with my friends (issues etc which affected them and made me feel bad for them). but we ended up taking anyway. 

I had 1 pink dove left from a couplea months ago which I consumed at 10:30pm. I still had an orange red bull (http://www.pillreports.com/index.php?page=display_pill&amp;id=29998) and half a blue defqon (http://www.pillreports.com/index.php?page=display_pill&amp;id=29825) on me. at about 1am, I was sober. Simple as that, I was sober. I decided to take half of the orange redbull, I didnt feel it kick in as well as the pink dove, Just felt energetic and I talked more than usual. Ironically enough this only lasted for like 1.5 - 2 hours. During this I had a little panic attack and drank WAY too much water. At about 3am I took the last bit of the red bull and half the defqon. At 3:30 I puked, water. LOADS of it. I don't think the last dose ever got to kick in due to that because I was sober right away. Again. 

Now I've got another rave coming up next month.. And I want to trip hard at that rave. But I'm scared it wont last for the entire night again. I was actually more sleepy than some people who stayed sober all night. How on earth did I manage that? What did I do wrong? Can it be that it was just a bad night, as in uhh that the atmosphere influenced the trip which made it last shorter?

I talked about this with a friend and he suggested pure MDMA. According to him pure MDMA is stronger than MDMA in pills, because MDMA in pills gets cut more than pure MDMA. As example he gave me that a pill can contain 180mg mdma, but if that mdma is only 40% pure, a pill which contains 100mg mdma and is 80% pure will give better results.

How does this work? How should I dose pure MDMA? And how much? (I'm ~1.80m which is errr.. 5'9""? and weigh about 85-90kg which is 188 - 200lbs). How do I make sure that I last the whole night when lets say, I drop my first pill at 11-11:30pm. 

And most importantly.. What is the big difference between pure MDMA and pills?

TLDR; Didnt trip too well, rave wasnt as nice and I'm clueless as to why. I'm scared I'll never manage to trip a whole night again and I'm wondering how to extend a trip so it can last a whole night (without combining it with another amphetamine or ODing). Or whether you guys can point out what I did wrong. Any help will be greatly appreciated.

Also, I've been to raves sober in the meantime, so I don't necessarily need it to enjoy a rave. It just gives the big raves that extra feels.

I was at a ridiculous party with about 200 people there. It was a giant party in a field, and myself and a few other DJ's were spinning electro house the whole night. Until that night, I had thought about trying MDMA but didn't because I could never verify a safe source. Then I met a friend who had a safe supply, so I immediately jumped on it. That was the best night of my life so far. The memories are still so vivid in my head and I relive the night all the time.

Anyway, since then I've rolled 10 or so times. Each time taking on average 150mg. 

On to my question, Bassnectar is at the end of the month and I definetly want to roll for that night. I've only got about a month until the show, so I'm just thinking of not rolling at all until the show to get my tolerance up.

This is also my first concert, besides a few shows I've played before (meaning I've never been in the audience). So I want to make it as memorable as possible. I'm going with two life long friends, both of which are rolling that night.

I know that ideally, I wouldn't have rolled at all anytime before the event, but unfortunately I only found out about it today. :( So I'll have to work with what I've been dealt so to speak. 

Also, if anybody has any general safety tips while rolling at EDM shows I would greatly appreciate that. The environment at an EDM show will be much different than when I have rolled before, so I want to know how to make sure myself and my friends are having the best, safest time.

Today I decided to ask him how his friend was. Apparently, 24 hours after being admitted to the hospital, he was taken off of a breathing machine. But now the kid is going for dialysis treatment.

Would some underlying health issue cause this kid to need dialysis now? Or does MDMA have the ability to cause your kidneys to fail?",,False,self,t5_2qwvg,False,,,True,t3_zjm7b,http://www.reddit.com/r/MDMA/comments/zjm7b/friend_needs_dialysis_after_passing_out_from/,

First day I took dragonflies, which I have been researching and seem to almost always be MDA.  That day the roll was a lot more of a body/trippy roll with tons of energy.  Second day we took capsules of MDMA and the roll was completely different: More euphoria, more empathy, and generally more happiness.  Both the pills and the capsules were tested so we knew what we were taking.  However, now in the spirit of maximizing the roll and harm reduction (as in not rolling two days in a row) I'm looking to combine both for future adventures.  

Has anyone else had experience with combining MDMA and MDA and if so, how did you go about dosing them? I cant find information on whether one potentates the other, meaning I would only have to take the amount total that I would normally dose in MDMA, or if I need to stack them in order to get all of the effects.

So first of all, I got surprised with a free 2-day pass from a friend to E-Zoo. I originally had tickets just for an after-party on Sunday night (where I was planning to roll in the post above). I went to the last day of E-Zoo sober and then went on my way to the after party (the previous day maybe I took a hit of a joint and 2 beers, but no rolls).

So I get to the show and drop my first roll at roughly 12:30. Now it's the same come up as before (as expected since it was from the same person).

2:30 comes around, and I'm starting to come down a bit. I've got another hour and a half, so I drop my second roll. Again, same dosage as before (~.2).

Maybe 15 minutes later, I felt like I got struck by lightning and just got the highest I've ever felt. Initially it was a shock, so I drank some Vitamin Water, and got a cupcake (I have diabetes, I thought if I pass out, at least my blood sugar will be up), ate about half of it (big ass fucking cupcake).

Once I finally came to terms with the up (maybe 3 minutes), I went back out and danced my fucking ass off with my friends. Come down was a little harsher than normal, but nothing.

My question is this. I did everything the same as the last time I rolled (dosage and even timing of dosages, give or take maybe a minute or so). So why was this roll significantly more intense than the last one? The only thing I could think of is maybe my friend gave me a higher dose than he said (I didn't exactly inspect the pill thoroughly before taking it).

My friend may also partake in the MDMA, though he hasn't decided yet. None of us have any experience with MDMA at all, though my friend and I are otherwise pretty experienced psychonauts.

- sitting

- talking

- listening to music

- making music with my friend

- going for a walk 

- going for a drive (with my sober wife as the pilot obviously)

Taking more MDMA too long after your initial dose will enhance the speedy effect of the experience, but won't do much to improve the happy/magic aspect of your roll. Taking one large upfront dose is preferable to redosing throughout the night.

""MDMA will at first releases huge amounts of serotonin, then it will inhibit vesicular monoamine transporters. this makes the serotonin cycle back n forth in the neuron, but more serotonin isn't going to be able enter into the cycle at this point. Taking more MDMA after a certain point (usually 45-60 minutes user experience shows) won't do anything for the serotonin feeling, but you may get a rush of dopamine because dopamine is able to rebuild its supply much faster (and its not as inhibited as serotonin).""

Assuming my connect comes through I should be getting some MDMA for a drum circle tonight. I'm not sure if it will be in powdered, rock, or pill form. I know about pill reports etc. If its powdered i have a gel cap to use, but what if it comes in little rocks. Just see if i can put those in the gel cap? Swallow them whole? What do?

What about price? How much should i be paying for a single dose of 150mgs in any form?

I've also been taking lots of creatine as i'm in the loading phase for the supplement. I need to drink a shit ton of water with it, especially if i take the daily loading dose of 20g. Today i only took 10g, so the ammount of water i need to drink most likely won't be too bad... i think. Does anyone have experience with creatine and MDMA?

I'm using a throwaway primarily because I feel a need to ask this question. I masturbate a lot. Will this affect my serotonin levels in a way that will negatively influence my experience?

Finally, I dont have access to a testing kit. If i'm sold a pill i can look it up on pill reports, but what if it isnt pressed into a pill? Any way i can try to ensure it is MDMA? Taste? Smell? Solubility in water?

I was the host and the more experienced one and I let things go to far. Basically I guess what I'm trying to say is don't forget self control, and your sober thoughts.

I am going to HARD Summer with my brother and his girlfriend, but due to some short-sighted scheduling drama we are desperate, desperate for a Saturday night ticket.

MIND BLOWN!!!",4,1,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/MDMA/comments/1knkyz/just_personnaly_met_eptic_dubstep_michael_bella/,"Okay so here's the thing, I'm 23 and I've been part of the montreal's city dubstep scene for about 3 years, because of the MUSIC aspect and the cool and open minded people in it. I have a lot of musical backgrounds and grown up experiences with music, ITS A THERAPY!....and OH MY GOD TRUST ME I know what is UK and US raves ;) bouncing WITH A SWEEEEET VIBE...and last night I've done 2 160mg pure mdma for the 3rd time in 1 year, in all the best conditions possible, and the past 2 were just AWESOME, but THIS ONE...I learned so much from it!!! Here's my point: what happens when you combine PASSIONS, HAPPINESS and a power to unlock just 1% of our brain....like upgrading your grey matter! ;)

I've always been an extremely shy guy since long time, and many times instead of DOING something I was just THINKING of it. I have a lot of trust issues with everyone because of past experiences and I dont trust anyone at raves, so I always have to rely on that little voice inside my head and surely, GUT FEELINGS to feel everything. Im a REALLY REALLY receptive person in general life, so when you add a little bit of MAGIC in me... OHOHOHOHO WOOOOW I'VE HAD THE BEST TRIP EVER!!!!!
I never want to go talk to unknown people because i dont know why but im afraid of i dont know what... but everyone in the DUB scene are telling me that I have THAT light... and that smile that never fades away, and that I can control a whole crowd, but i'm afraid of it. so I never show up on stage... SO HERES THE THING!
When Eptic started shit just got FUCKED UP HAHAHA. I FELT EVERYTHING. They were mosh pits(FUCKING DOUCHEBAGS AND K-TARDS!!!) so me and my bro decided to go in the second row while we were killing them with LASER GUNS, LASERS DO KILL PEOPLE!!! :P The whole 1h30 of his set him and I had a connection that no one can describe, we were both bouncing on the exact same beat and were smiling at each other hahahahaha so much bromance :P After I just went to check the right for my friend, and ive seen EPTIC getting hooked with some kind of fucked up guy, and then he sees me and my bro and immediatly comes to see me and tell me ""Come with me"" and im like, OOH, WELL HAHAHA. Then we walked around the bloc for a talk about the scene and funny stuff, and wow he was so friendly!!! And he was filming videos with his tour Gopro... man that was boss.. seriously nothing can make me happier today!! It looked like this but in 1000X times better :P https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6G6AJXJ4Z0
For someone like me that has a low self esteem and trust issues, but is a really good person who enjoys life so much, I've put barriers to myself to protect me.... but those barriers, with only a single shot of mdma, can drastically be broken, BECAUSE THERES NO LIMIT TO A GOOD BRAIN AND THE POWER OF THE MIND!!
Today I am cured, Now I can go talk to EVERYONE out there that has a good vibe. MDMA HAS CURED MY INHIBITIONS and low self esteem problems, and gave us the chance to share the PLUR with one big personnality!!

There are no limits.... Magic? ;)
I love you all ♥",,False,self,t5_2qwvg,False,,,True,t3_1knkyz,http://www.reddit.com/r/MDMA/comments/1knkyz/just_personnaly_met_eptic_dubstep_michael_bella/,
