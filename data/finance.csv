Where is all the money?  I hear nothing but bad news about financial crisis all over the world, and it seems that there is a shortage of cash - like it is some sort of natural resource.

People haven't stopped buying stuff.  They still need food, clothing, medicine, shelter. Taxes are still collected. Fines are still levied. 

So where is all the money?  I mean, labor has been produced to make things and wages paid to the laborers. The things are purchased by other laborers, who were paid for producing goods or services, etc.  It's a closed loop, right? 

Can someone explain it like I'm five or something?",,False,,t5_2qhfj,False,,,True,t3_utf5u,http://www.reddit.com/r/finance/comments/utf5u/where_has_all_the_money_in_the_world_gone/,

Here is how it works:

This website (run through marketwatch.com) uses the real and active stock market to get its data, it then gives you a set amount of fake money to make trades.  It delays the trades like the real market would, it lets you do short sales, set limits on buys and sales, do all kinds of real market tricks as if it was a real trade.

I'm setting up a new game for Reddit to play.  The rules are simple.

You get $100,000 to start off with.

The game will run 3 months, starting today.  It will end on February 7th.  Players can join at any time.

No stocks can be bought for less than $2.  (this prevents someone from putting all $100,000 into penny stocks, then when they rise 1 cent selling and then not trading any more till the game ends.  &gt;$2 makes the game more risky.)

All symbols and markets are open to be played.

Each trade will cost a $10 commission.

Selling on the margin is disabled, you only have your $100,000 to play with.

You can not trade in partial shares (must purchase in full share increments).

The game is private for Reddit.  You will need the password to play.

Here is the link to the game:  www.marketwatch.com/game/the-reddit-challenge

The password is:  **narwhalbacon**



The more people play the more fun this is, if we get enough players I'll make us our own Subreddit.

I personally know very little about the stock market, I've never traded for real money, only this game.  Everything I know I learned from playing this game, it is quite educational.  It can be as complicated and time consuming as you want to make it, we used to have guys who would flat out day-trade the game, and others who made a few purchases and then let it ride for the whole game.

The game is now up and running, hope to see you there.

You will need to make an account to play, which is free, (obviously, how else would it track your profile).

**EDIT**

It might be premature but I went ahead and made a new sub-reddit for this game, since its spanning several other subs at this point. ([/r/gaming](/r/gaming) [/r/finance](/r/finance) and [/r/Economics](/r/Economics) )

I'm adding content as I come across and understand it and got quite a few post ideas but was wondering if anyone could help me out. 

What kind of financial concepts or ideas would you like to be explained? Maybe something you would like to know more about or see another perspective on? I'll be sure to credit your recommendation on the post itself! :)

I'm hoping that a suggestion here can help me focus on one aspect of finance because there's just too much im trying to cover! 

I wouldn't mind doing a bit of research and writing about a concept im not familiar with - after all, I want to learn more myself! This'll most likely be the case as im only in my sophomore year at University haha but I'm definitely looking for a challenge :)

Below is a current list of our starred 'experts' for r/finance.  Remember, in order to maintain your starred status, you must do an AMA.  The purpose of the AMA is to shed light on your educational background, what you do in finance, and generally open up discussion (and peoples eyes) to different types of financial paths, professions, and topics.

You do not have to get extremely personal (ie, naming schools, companies, etc; however, letting people know what region you are in would probably help greatly).

Let's try and make this easy on, not only myself, but the other mods as well.  I don't want to have to chase every single individual down in order to get you to do this.  Please just recognize that you are a starred user, your name is on this list and people want to hear what you have to say.  

If you don't do one or make no attempt to do one I will have to remove your star.  So step up and do your AMA.

Let me know if you have questions or comments.

I know finance extends beyond trading, but I want to show you how I go through a potential trade.

This one is a little tricky and involves many moving parts, but this trade generally works out well.

We know what the VIX is, right? It's a measure of the volatility in SPX options. It's also known as a ""fear gauge"" as it goes up when the market goes down.

Well, there's also OVX -- this is the ""vix"" for USO options. Fear presents itself very differently in commodities. If you look at the volatility skew in USO, GLD or commodity options, it actually ""smiles"" because there is fear of upside movement. 

We're seeing that right now in the oil market. $OVX has gone from a low of 25 from late last year to 44.15. That means the options market is expecting a monthly percentage move of about 12.75%. To get that number, you take the OVX reading and divide by sqrt(12)-- it's a quick calculation.

So I think this is a bit of a fade. Yes, Qadaffyduck is a douche and he could set the Libyan oil fields on fire, but odds of a very, very strong move in USO probably won't happen.

So what's the trade? Here's what I'm looking to do:

&gt; Buy the Mar 40 Call;
&gt; Sell 2x the Mar 42 Call;
&gt; Total credit: about .45

This trade makes money on a move higher, but not a move past 44.50 by March expiration. You're also selling OTM calls, which have a much higher implied vol compared to the 40 calls. The only problem here is the near term gamma risk, but that can be hedged by trading around stock and /cl futures.

Here's the risk profile: http://i.imgur.com/6F6Hq.png
And here's the skew you're selling: http://i.imgur.com/ZqNJz.png

What are your methods? Do you know a good way to do that on an Android device and on the go?

Please post your ideas!

I've given this topic some thought and here's what I've been using so far:

* Youtube daily market updates/review/etc. Search YT for these keywords and set time filter to 'today' and you will see a really small list of users who post such stuff. Unfortunately mostly it's only related to forex. I can use it on the go through YT Android app however which is a big plus.

* Bloomberg app. Not very useful since the amount of news is staggering and their stories are very long. I usually end up reading the headings.

* RSS feeds. One Polish portal has brief analysis/commentary section to which you can subscribe. And RSS can be easily picked up on mobile devices... Unfortunately I haven't found an English equivalent.

* BBC Business News. I can read it on mobile, but stories are very general. However their biggest advantage is that their stories are very concise, easy to read and not to technical.

* FT and WSJ app. Most news are locked though and their apps are of questionable quality.

I'm a kind of a person that likes to have everything in one place. As you can see my situation now is to flick between several apps which is no fun really.

Can a non-billionaire either avoid loss or even profit from these ""wildly inappropriate"" prices?",48,18,38,http://www.reddit.com/r/finance/comments/1ajrro/charlie_munger_and_warren_buffet_believe_that/,"It seems like the argument is that short term volatility should not have a bearing on long term (years and years) price predictions.

Do we see these ""wildly inappropriate values"" in warrants or LEAPs or is it just in the 15-20 year put options sold by Berkshire (as described on [page 16 of the 2007 annual report [PDF]](http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/2007ar/2007ar.pdf))

[exact quote from 2010 annual report [PDF], page 21](http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/2010ar/2010ar.pdf)

&gt;**Both Charlie and I believe that Black-Scholes produces wildly inappropriate values when applied to long-dated options.** We set out one absurd example in these pages two years ago. More tangibly, we put our money where our mouth was by entering into our equity put contracts. By doing so, we implicitly asserted that the Black-Scholes calculations used by our counterparties or their customers were faulty.

&gt;We continue, nevertheless, to use that formula in presenting our financial statements. Black-Scholes is the accepted standard for option valuation – almost all leading business schools teach it – and we would be
accused of shoddy accounting if we deviated from it. Moreover, we would present our auditors with an insurmountable problem were we to do that: They have clients who are our counterparties and who use Black-Scholes values for the same contracts we hold. It would be impossible for our auditors to attest to the accuracy of both their values and ours were the two[sic] far apart.

&gt;Part of the appeal of Black-Scholes to auditors and regulators is that it produces a precise number. Charlie and I can’t supply one of those. We believe the true liability of our contracts to be far lower than that calculated by Black-Scholes, but we can’t come up with an exact figure – anymore than we can come up with a precise value for GEICO, BNSF, or for Berkshire Hathaway itself. Our inability to pinpoint a number doesn’t
bother us: We would rather be approximately right than precisely wrong.

The ""absurd example"" is on [page 20 of the 2008 annual report [PDF]](http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/2008ar/2008ar.pdf)

&gt;So let’s postulate that we sell a 100- year $1 billion put option on the S&amp;P 500 at a strike price of 903 (the index’s level on 12/31/08). Using the implied volatility assumption for long-dated contracts that we do, and combining that with appropriate interest and dividend assumptions, we would find the “proper” Black-Scholes premium for this contract to be $2.5 million.

&gt;To judge the rationality of that premium, we need to assess whether the S&amp;P will be valued a century from now at less than today. Certainly the dollar will then be worth a small fraction of its present value (at only
2% inflation it will be worth roughly 14¢). So that will be a factor pushing the stated value of the index higher. Far more important, however, is that one hundred years of retained earnings will hugely increase the value of most of the companies in the index. In the 20th Century, the Dow-Jones Industrial Average increased by about
175-fold, mainly because of this retained-earnings factor.


&gt;Considering everything, I believe the probability of a decline in the index over a one-hundred-year period to be far less than 1%. But let’s use that figure and also assume that the most likely decline – should one
occur – is 50%. Under these assumptions, the mathematical expectation of loss on our contract would be $5 million ($1 billion X 1% X 50%).

&gt;But if we had received our theoretical premium of $2.5 million up front, we would have only had to invest it at 0.7% compounded annually to cover this loss expectancy. Everything earned above that would have been profit. Would you like to borrow money for 100 years at a 0.7% rate?
Let’s look at my example from a worst-case standpoint. Remember that 99% of the time we would pay nothing if my assumptions are correct. But even in the worst case among the remaining 1% of possibilities – that
is, one assuming a total loss of $1 billion – our borrowing cost would come to only 6.2%. Clearly, either my assumptions are crazy or the formula is inappropriate.

&gt;The ridiculous premium that Black-Scholes dictates in my extreme example is caused by the inclusion of volatility in the formula and by the fact that volatility is determined by how much stocks have moved around
in some past period of days, months or years. This metric is simply irrelevant in estimating the probabilityweighted range of values of American business 100 years from now. (Imagine, if you will, getting a quote every day on a farm from a manic-depressive neighbor and then using the volatility calculated from these changing quotes as an important ingredient in an equation that predicts a probability-weighted range of values for the farm a century from now.)

Well she ended up punching 100m @ 103.57 in our vwap algo, instead of just 1m into the bloomberg then clicking hit at 103.57 or lower.

So the guy comes back from the toilet, looks at the screen sees the vwap algo going off and has bought about 59m in the past 5 minutes, closes the algo. Starts freaking out, now the problem is that since FI is all OTC the vwap algo had hit up ALL the dealers to buy the 59m, so their automated system would quote a shitty bid for the rest of the day (no dealer wants to get picked off).

It was a fun afternoon trying to unload 58m of dbr's, took about 2 weeks to unwind them at a profit.

Over the past few weeks we have started to see a continuation of two things:

* An increase in subscribers

* An increase in posts.

Both of those are great and what contribute to a great, mature subreddit full of intelligent individuals.  Although it is our goal to continue growing this subreddit and have it be as open as possible to financial topics, we must draw the line somewhere.  We do not want this sub to become the cluster fuck that is r/economics.

That being said, we have added a much more clear and concise rule to the informational side bar located to the right:

&gt;Questions regarding loans, refinancing, mortgages, credit cards, investing and anything else that may be related to personal finance should be directed towards the subreddit r/personalfinance.  We have provided the link to that subreddit below.

As you can see it clearly outlines how we, as a community, feel about personal finance.  There is a specific sub devoted to topics such as those.  Please do not submit topics that are geared towards personal finance.  The people in this sub are not interested in personal finance, despite the fact that they will help you anyway.

Submissions that are centered around the topic of personal finance will be removed.

If you have any questions or concerns about this, please feel free to voice your opinion.

Thank you for your continued support and help in making this the most intelligent and mature subreddit on this site.

Not sure if this is a naive question or a loaded question, but I'm having a hard time understanding how interest rates affect the profits of different financial institutions. I understand that the banking industry is most affected by things like credit risk and interest rate risk, but still can't make the complete connection.

Do higher interest rates increase the number of defaults? Do banks overall prefer lower or higher interest rates or are they indifferent and would prefer stability?

How has it come to pass that on the evening news that we always see only stock indices? Why not bonds? 

It's plain to see that the amount in debt securities overwhelms the amounts of equity securities held. Debt securities also do not show quite the volatility of their equity counterparts. 

Sure, if you want to spread fear among the general population, show them plummeting stock prices but when most pension funds are likely put together with bonds, why make the problem worse? Why purposefully ruin the general sentiment about the market among the general public? It seems to me that this is actually counterproductive. My first guess is that it's because stocks are easier to understand, though I doubt any average person actually understands anything about financial markets at all (I don't claim to be an expert, either).

I am currently a computer engineering student about to graduate with a minor in math and a focus on software. I have found though that without being applied somewhere, software design can get tedious and old, so I have began to look for specific applications of where my mathematical and software skills can go. I recently found a masters in quantitative and computational finance program that I feel I am very qualified for.

So here are my questions: How difficult will it be moving into a finance having nothing more than a rudimentary understanding of economics and some options experience?

Are there many computational finance jobs out there? If so, are they highly competitive?

In hedge funds though when they charge their 2% management fee and 20% on gains how do they fund these fees? Do they collect these fees at the end of the fund or do they sell some of their holdings at the end of each year to collect their fees? I feel like the latter option would diminish the returns for the clients as it would be taking out capital earlier that could be growing until the end of the fund.

This leaves r/finance in kind of a messed up situation.  Without a mod, no one can access the info bar to place/remove valuable information on it.  In addition, no one can remove spam or reported content.  With almost 1500 subscribers, this makes this sub a moderate sized community.  It would be a big pain in the ass to make a new sub and attempt to move everyone to a new location.

I messaged the reddit admins asking them to remove soupnatzi as mod and replace him with me so that we can start getting use out of this sub again and move the sub in a positive direction content wise.  An admin replied asking me to make a self post in r/finance to see if others agreed that the current mod situation is not working out.

If you look at their most recent quarter, their operating income @ 10.7 is really low compared to other years. What does that mean? Unusual expenses are also high...

The second company is [UBA](https://www.google.ca/finance?q=NYSE%3AUBA&amp;fstype=ii&amp;ei=jVs4UeCGHcSEqQH48wE)

I'm assuming most people responding will understand the premise of how the Accredited Investor standard applies/works. Essentially, what I've found is that the policy/rationale for the Accredited Investor standard has pretty much never been stated, nor has the standard been empirically shown to have a positive effect. I understand that the rough basis of the standard is to protect unsophisticated investors from losing their money to fraud and other bad investments while preserving their relatively small amount of money for ""socially desirable"" actions like home buying etc. 

There are a few problems I see with the standard:

(1) Wealth is an poor proxy for sophistication - For example Lady Gaga, who would be considered an Accredited Investor (via net worth or annual income), whereas pretty much no 2nd year investment banker or PE guy will be an Accredited Investor (assuming no family wealth, on the basis that they haven't had 2 years of $200k+ income, unless there's some special exemption for them that i'm missing here?)

(2) I get the argument that these wealthy people can afford to hire investment advisors and so they can basically ""buy sophistication"" by hiring someone. But even most lay people can hire an investment advisor of some kind and besides, that's the point of many of these investments in the first place, (hedge funds or VC funds for example) that they will use your money in an area they are sophisticated but you are not.

(3) $1MM is a very low number that leaves in a lot of people that are not going to be very financially sophisticated (on average) such as late career doctors and lawyers.

(4) We have many financial certifications (and other practices such as Law and Medicine) that require the passing of tests to demonstrate ample sophistication to practice, why can't something like that be permitted here?

It also occurs to me that the standard probably contributes, at least a little bit, to wealth disparity, by preventing the ""poor"" from having access to the earning mechanisms of the ""wealthy.""

Thoughts? Comments? Tell me why I'm wrong and this standard is absolutely critical to the global economy?

EDIT: Thanks so much to everyone that has chimed in with their thoughts. I'm actually working on a 40+ page research paper/academic article on this topic (I picked the topic, so I'm also genuinely interested in discussing it, not just using people to help me write my paper) and this has already helped me significantly in uncovering a lot of arguments both against my proposition and even some for it (that go even further free market than my thoughts).

The ratings agencies are ultimately responsible to buyers, since these are the people who depend on the ratings agencies to ensure the quality of the buyers' investments. And yet the ratings agencies' business models are still dependent on the ratings deals they can secure from investment banks. In other words, it's the ratings agencies asking the investment banks ""please let us rate the securities you issue."" 

My question is, why can't this balance of power be reversed? Why can't the agencies find other sources of revenue, whether it be consultant fees, publication sales, etc. (i.e. sources that are derived from buyers)? 

This way, ratings agencies would compete not on the basis of how many deals they secure, but on the accuracy of their guidance and their value to the buyers that depend on them.  Theoretically, this would also create an atmosphere where investment banks seek out the ratings of the best agencies, as buyers would shun securities that aren't rated by the best.

This seems like an idea worth dedicating one's professional life to: solve the fundamental flaw of ratings agencies while building the most respected ratings agency in the world.

I want to quit,47,20,63,http://www.reddit.com/r/finance/comments/1175x4/first_internship_and_it_sucks_i_want_to_quit/,"I've already posted this on WSO but I wanted some reddit input as well. [WSO post](http://www.wallstreetoasis.com/forums/first-internship-and-it-kinda-sucks-wanting-to-quit)

I'm a sophomore in college and got my first finance related internship this semester. This is my third week. I'm supposed to work until December and I'm not getting paid (just compensated for lunch and transportation).

The problem is that it's not really related to finance and it's basically a sales role at an analytics company. And I really suck at sales with English not being my first language and just being a shy person in general. I basically get yelled at every day. I'm pretty sure the company REALLY needed interns and that's why I got an offer. I don't really like the people in my office, but I assume that happens everywhere.

More information on the company: it is an outsourced analytics company. All research work is done in India and no one in the NYC office does research.

What I do: I make cold sales calls, dig up companies and phone numbers to call, and sometimes write memos about companies my bosses have sales meetings with.

Since this was the first offer I got, I got too excited and accepted right away, which was a huge mistake because a few days later I was offered positions at different companies where I could learn more about the finance industry itself.

I really wanted to quit, but the boss, who went to my school, keeps telling me that she'll be in a difficult position if I quit. And she promised me that she will put me in contact with different people if I do well (she used to work in IBD). I'm afraid she might talk bad about me to her contacts if I quit. Since I don't have any relevant work experience, I need something on my resume too.

But every day it's just frustrating because I feel like I'm not improving at all and I keep getting yelled at. I'm sure sales skills are probably a good thing to have, but I want to go into equity research (presumably a sector I wouldn't need a lot of sales skills for).

Since I only have two more months, should I just suck it up and stick with this job?

**TL;DR:** Sophomore majoring in finance doing sales internship. Job sucks and I'm not learning a lot. Boss who used to be in IBD says she can put me in contact with people if I do well. I don't have work experience. Should I stick with the job until I get done in December?

Edit (10/18/12): I've been sticking out so far and will probably do so until at least this month and then see what happens.

During our explosive growth, the informative content and intelligent conversation grew with the subscriber base; however, along the way we also seemed to spark the interest of people looking to get into finance or wanting to learn more about finance as a career path.  We began seeing more posts centered around how to get into finance.  It was around this time I created the sub [r/financialcareers](http://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/) (also listed on our sidebar) and began to redirect all career posts to this sub.  We made a post about it and began moderating career posts fairly heavily in an effort to keep r/finance substance based.  We received a lot of backlash from the community at the time, saying this wasn't necessary, the sub wasn't big enough to warrant splitting out career content, etc.  Over this time we have gotten a lot more lenient with the career types of posts.

Recently, the community seems to be aggravated at the level of career posts.  The Mods have been discussing the issue via the mod chat and we believe it is time to bring this issue back up to the community to decide what you want to do.  We honestly try to let the members dictate what content appears on the front page through upvoting and downvoting.  We believe we have set pretty good and solid ground rules (on the sidebar) for what this sub is supposed to be.  It is up to you guys to take it from there.  

So, let this thread be a place to discuss this issue.  If the community wants this career focused content banned, we will ban it and redirect it to r/financialcareers.

2) If a large shareholder dumps their trades what would happen if no one is on the other end to buy them?

Since there seems to be a lot of ""im in school and need guidance/help"" posts, I'll start with the beginning;

I started undergrad at Stetson university as an international business major. After a difficult conversation with my neighbor (M&amp;A Lawyer) about how this degree will help me I decided to switch to finance (Sophomore year). Sophomore year I really wasn't ""following the markets."" I wasn't into finance because; a) the coursework was fairly mundane and b) I didn't know the scope of what I could do within the industry (from I-Banking to VC to being a broker to Investment Management to trading). 

That summer I started to tentatively follow the markets during my study abroad in Austria. 

I came back Junior year with a fresh appetite for learning the material and really applied myself, I started to pull my grades up (had too much fun freshman/sophomore year) and took an AMAZING PE/VC class that really got my brain spinning with wanting to get into buyside finance. Much to my disappointment I realized that I didnt have the grades (3.3 gpa) or the brand name school to get anywhere near that side of the industry. 

I started applying aggressively to all the bulge bracket bank websites for internships in August/September of 2007 (keep the time frame in mind as it is important). I didnt, and was not expecting, to hear anything back at all. I got a phone call from one bank and went through the interview process for the asset management internship program, 3 interview total; 1 behavioral 1 technical/current event 1 getting to know management (ie you have it in the bag). 

**Bolded because I cannot emphasize this enough -- without this internship I would never ever ever ever be in the position I am in now. I can comfortably place 100% of my relative success on this internship.**

I did very well during my internship, however, only 1 intern out of a class of 49 got an offer (this was summer of 2008). I learned for summer of 2009 they were going to make all internships unpaid except iBanking. 

Senior year I got my first taste of the buyside with my experience in a student managed endowment class. 10 sutdents about $13 million of capital and buy/hold/sell reports every half quarter on any equity (first semester). Same set up except on debt securities second semester. All around an incredible experience and actually gave me selling experience/research experience/valuation experience and a feel for what I would be doing in the real world. This course made it onto my resume because of how amazing it was. 

I did a 13 month mating dance with the bank I interned for, had about 15-18 interviews for 6 or 7 positions (going 2nd and 3rd round in a few).

Finally, I got a break in Miami. Worked for a year and got an offer from the group I worked with during my internship. Now you're caught up. 

**What I Do**

I basically oversee money from institutions/pension funds. We specialize in liquidity events and developing balanced portfolios while delivering alpha (yeah, that was lifted almost verbatim out of a pitchbook). 

My job:

Basically follow the news. Look at everything from geopolitical (we've been super busy with Egypt, our PBR trade has been awesome so far) to M&amp;A to earnings etc. Develop debt and equity strategy and then if we decide to put on a trade develop an effective strategy for buying either equity, debt, equity &amp; debt, or derivatives. Its a fun job and I get to work relatively sane hours (5.30a - 6.30/7p -- weekends if I want, not really req'd since markets aren't open). 

My daily routine:
This is basically what I did in Miami and what I imagine LA will be like.
4a - Swim for 30 minutes
5.30a - get into office -- read news, check futures, morning calls, emails etc
6.30a - watch how we open, check for news
6.40a - 1230p - debate ideas with MD, conf calls, talk to investors, put on trades (if we do anything that day), research, work on my own models and team models.
1p - watch the close
1.01p - pee for the first time all day since 6.30
1.05p - 4.30 work on models, conf calls
4.30 - 6.30 - meetings (if none day will end at 4.30)
7p - gym
9p - dinner

Salary;

I make less than 80k base and more than 50k base. Bonus will probably be based partly on performance and be part discretionary (i'm hoping around 20k -- pretty low actually). 

I know I'm probably missing a lot of stuff so ask away, I'll be replying for a few hours tonight and around the same time tomorrow.

group at my school, need help so I don't get ripped 
apart like last year",34,9,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/finance/comments/zeoue/interviewinggiving_a_pitch_soon_for_a_financial/,"So like the title states, I'm applying for a financial group at my university that primarily researches and invests in equities.  This group is extremely competitive but I managed to make it to the final round of interviews last year (approximately 15 of the 45 or so that apply).  At that point I had to make a stock pitch for Chevron.   I feel like I should mention that I'm a finance major and that I've done some investing in equities with my dad when I was younger (around 13 or 14 years old).  He just ran me through the very basics though.

Back to the story, I got completely ripped apart during my pitch.  I was confident going in that I had done my best and I had results to show after the hours of research I put in.  I included horizontal analysis and vertical analysis of a lot of the commonly examined financial statement ratios like P/E, ROE, ROA, dividend payout, free cash flow, etc, as well as a few liquidity ratios.  I also examined some intangible things such as Chevron getting access to an important drilling area near Russia and the fact that the dollar was depreciating at the time

I feel like I had very little confidence as to what was most crucial to look at before I started preparing, so I tried to include everything possible.  So even though I'm not sure the following things are useful, I also included the price compared to market cap and also the volume of sales over the past 3 months before the time of my interview/pitch.  I also looked at moving averages and exponentially weighted moving averages for Chevron.

So I guess my question is, what is good to look at and what is just BS when looking to invest?  I'm not coming here first, because I've done plenty of research.  But it just seems like I can't get a straight answer from anyone.  Some people/places say stick to the financial statements, some it's just examine the graphs, the business structure of the company, or even just take a look at the business's competitors and determine if the company's shares are currently incorrectly priced.  Or is that how it really is, and everyone has their own opinions on what is best to look at?

I'm interested in asset management and I'd like to start investing on my own as well, but I feel very misguided right now.  Even if I was just given some sort of ""importance tier"" list of things to look at when researching possible investments, it would make things so much easier for me.  I've been learning in some of my finance classes how to price shares in the CAPM model but I don't see much application for that in the market aside from diversification, which can be done without CAPM honestly.  Like what do Morningstar and Bloomberg and YahooFinance look at when they give out their analysis on equities?

I kind of rambled but I hope you get the gist of this.  Thanks in advance.",,False,,t5_2qhfj,False,,,True,t3_zeoue,http://www.reddit.com/r/finance/comments/zeoue/interviewinggiving_a_pitch_soon_for_a_financial/,

I feel it is important to give everyone a full understanding of what is actually happening.

First and foremost, I do not work for BofA.  I do bank with them and have for eleven years.  Within these eleven years I have lived in eight different cities.  A combination of college, post college living, and different jobs.  It has made sense for me, for multiple reasons, to have a national bank that offers excellent online services due to me not really being grounded in a specific location.  

I, along with everyone else, was pretty pissed when they decided they were going to come out with the debit fee.  Mostly because I did not fully understand what the fee was about.  Regardless, I was getting tired of big banks and their bullshit.  I made it a point to go to BofA and see what the hell was going on.

Here is what the new fee is:

* $5.00 fee per month if debit card used
* Fee not implemented if you use debit card to withdraw cash
* Fee not implemented if checking account has a minimum balance of $5,000.00 or more

The BofA representative was very adamant in stressing the fact that it is not a $5.00 fee for having a checking account.  Please also keep in mind that all big national banks are now going to be doing this as well starting 1/2012.

For me, it is not so much the $60.00 annual that was making me mad.  $60.00/year is nothing.  It was more the principle of the matter.  After discussing with the BofA representative, I realized I would not be hit with the fee for two reasons:

* I maintain the checking limit
* I use credit cards for everything and pay them off monthly (builds points, more secure, etc)

That being said, I am a working finance professional.  I have an excellent career at an excellent company.  Staying with BofA works for me.  I do not know the personal details of a lot of you.  I imagine most of you are students or very young professionals and the rest of you are already grounded, established adults.  I urge most of you to look into the following:

* If you are grounded in a specific area, bank locally.  Credit Unions are the preferred source in this situation.
* If you are looking for national banks, I suggest taking a look at the following:
    
    Charles Schwab
    
    Ally
   
    ING
    
    USAA

The four banks above offer free online checking.  They can do so because they are not heavy on brick and mortar locations.  My suggestion would be USAA.  If you are military, a veteran or have family that served, you have access to their full program.  If you are a civilian, you still have access to their checking.  This is a pretty good kept secret that not a lot of people know about.  If I did switch banks, it would be to USAA.  Online banks also reimburse ATM fees, including the hefty ones found at strip clubs or bars.

So there you have it.  I hope this helps clear the air about what is happening with big banks and gives you some alternatives to look at.  Keep in mind that it is not advantageous to banks like BofA to give you free checking on an account that has $127.50.  Really, they aren't even looking to have college students anymore.  I think they did away with their college checking program I had when I was in college.

I work for what could be generally described as a value-oriented, global equity long/short fund. We are looking at a private investment (to be public in the next 5 years) and are estimating cost of equity capital. We like to use the market-derived capital pricing model (MCPM) as a backup for CAPM or other models (this is not meant to be a debate about the MCPM, but for more details, see [here](http://www.cosinconsulting.com.br/WebSite/artigos/What_is_your_real_cost_of_capital.pdf)).

One of the primary inputs to the MCPM is volatility. However, as this investment in particular is private we lack a volatility input, although we have several good public market proxies. In this case the expected leverage of the investment in question is higher than the market proxies. **Is there a reasonable method for estimating the volatility of the equity of this firm, given the public market proxies?**

From a quick read, it looks as though B-S-M worked on this and viewed the equity volatility as a function of firm value volatility and leverage, where the volatility of debt is assumed to be zero, i.e. firm value volatility = (debt / firm value) * debt volatility + (equity / firm value) * equity volatility, simplifying to equity volatility = (firm value / equity) * firm value volatility.

I always recommend that if they want to seek average returns with very low management fees that are consistent with equity markets, they should look at something like the Vanguard S&amp;P500 ETFs that has a MER of 0.05%, provides instant equity diversification, and average equity returns (which happen to be above average returns for all investments). As well, ETFs can be easily bought through services like questtrade and itrade and included in an RRSP account (Canadian registered retirement savings plan for tax deductions).

In my opinion with limited knowledge this can be the smartest thing anyone can do who wants to invest in equities, but doesn't want to worry about buying and selling all the time or researching the next best thing.

I think I'd rather work foods service or retail than continue with my internship. Any advice? Should I just quit? 

Its a paid internship with a major bank, but it's a **back office**. For those of you who don't know what that is, it's connecting dots. For example, somone gives me $5 to give to Client A.

My department generates nothing because it's all compliance. I learned that my first day of work and that's when I knew this wasn't for me. :/

I tried to find websites that solved this problem, and while there were a few (like streetsleuth), they were not organized well.

I wanted to solve the problem and learn a little as well, so I spent some time over the last month building a very simple, bare-bones website to aggregate RSS headline feeds from my favorite financial websites (no worries, I follow RSS terms of service to the ""T""). Built it with Bootstrap and hard-coded mostly everything. 

Anyways, I know the layout is still probably really shitty and there are tons of things that could be implemented, but I wanted to throw it out there and see what you all thought. I built it thinking it could help avid financial readers like myself, so I hope it serves that purpose. 

I would love any and all feedback as well. Some things I plan on doing in the near future (if people actually like the site):


1) Integrate with wordpress

2) Add a blog section where I list daily articles from various sources

3) Run a weekly spotlight on one independent blog (after all, who can honestly say they know every one of those blogs I've listed so far?)

4)Eventually... develop this into something like jockspin, with the most popular feeds displayed first, and user customization of feeds as well....

I'm working on a presentation on banking regulation and I came across this article that states that the cost of lending increases with increased regulation. 


Here's the quote I'm confused about. 


*INSEAD Professor of Banking and Finance Jean Dermine cautions some of the proposed regulations are going too far. In a new white paper entitled ""Banking regulations after the global financial crisis, good intentions and unintended evil"", he says these regulations may safeguard banks from future meltdowns but the economy could suffer because the supply of loans would be severely curtailed. In other words, the new banking regulations threaten to keep too much money in the vaults and not enough in the economy. ""This is an overreaction,"" Dermine told INSEAD Knowledge, ""because we should not forget that banks are extremely useful in the real economy, to finance lending to consumers and small and medium-sized companies. If you come with stringent regulations, **the cost of lending is going to go up tremendously**. The cost of bank loans to small firms will increase.""*


Can anyone kindly explain why the cost of lending would increase? I'm guessing it's because since banks would be required to keep more in reserves, they are going to have less capital to lend out - thus increasing the bank's required return, which would be the interest rate. If banks had more money to ""play around with"" they would be able to accept lower returns (issue loans at lower rates) and would be able to lend more funds.


So, decreased supply of loan-able funds = higher interest rate, right?


But how is this a cost to the bank? Is it that less in the quantity of loans (which would be an asset to the bank) means less earnings?


I'm confused. Please help.

Can you please help fact check this to see if I'm missing something?

Abstract: If one is looking to cash out investments all at once before 59.5 years of age, manipulating what tax bracket you're in and buying your own stocks could be superior to 401k investment.

Example: Home interest payments ensure that you'll be in the 15% income tax bracket for the next 10 years.  You take the money you would have invested in 401k and instead purchase the fund/investments directly yourself that the 401k plan would purchase.  You make purchases of the investments every month.  When it comes time to sell, you pay the 15% capital gains tax.  Your total tax burden on the investment compared to the 401k option is 30% (15% of the money you used to buy the stock was taxed before you got it from income tax, and 15% was taxed at sale via capital gains.)  Compare this to cashing out a 401k:  if the total $ amount sold is 198k or more (Head of Household, not single status) you bump up into the 33% income tax bracket, and the lump-sum sale of 401k is now 3% more costly to you than if you had bought your own stock from the beginning... except there are some unaccounted for factors:

- When purchasing stock directly, there is a price per transaction.  If you invest every month, you have 12 transactions per year to account for.  Does anyone have any input on how pricey that will be?  I find it hard to believe that it would be enough to nullify the 3% margin between the two paths (buying your own vs 401k contribution) 
EDIT: quick search shows $10 per trade on Etrade.  So $120 per year... only $1200 over 10 years.  The 3% is going to tower over that $1200 after 10 years!
- what else might I be missing that would cut into the greater profits that appear to be available using the ""buy your own method"" ?

Being able to liquidate these funds before 59.5 years old is highly desirable for me.

Can anyone explain how this might actually work?",34,11,39,http://www.reddit.com/r/finance/comments/rteps/11yearold_wins_prize_for_solving_euro_problem/,"[Here's a link to the CNN article.](http://www.cnn.com/2012/04/04/business/wolfson-prize-jurre-hermans/index.html?hpt=hp_c2)

Here's the part I don't understand:

&gt;Jurre, the youngest entrant to the prize, proposed Greece should leave the euro, with the Greek people slotting their funds into a bank ""exchange machine"" and getting drachma -- the Greek currency before the country joined the euro in 2001 -- back.
&gt;
&gt;As Jurre explains in his application, the bank then gives the euros to the Greek government and ""all these euros together form a pancake or a pizza. Now the Greek government can start to pay back all their debts, everyone who has a debt gets a slice of the pizza.""

How is that any different than the Greek government simply paying back their debts in euros now without exchanging currency? I don't understand how they can essentially buy back all of their citizens' euros and give them drachma, then use the euros that they paid drachma for to pay off Greece's debts.

As you have no doubt guessed, I'm not well versed in finance and I'm probably missing something crucial here but I just can't seem to wrap my head around how the Greek government exchanging one type of currency for another is a magic fix. They would essentially be duplicating the money, wouldn't that cause a massive drop in value of the drachma?

The plan they are on is indexed to the SP500, they get downside protection in that their minimum gain/loss in a year is 0%, but they also have upside capped at I believe 32%.  This 32% cap seems way too high to me, which means that the plan must be incredibly expensive.  However, the acquaintance could tell me nothing about the expense ratio of the plan - the management fees, etc. When he was sold the policy he either glossed over at the cost or it wasn't clearly communicated.  He says it's particularly useful for people in real estate because you can borrow against the policy, flip a property, and extract the gain prior to retirement.  I tried reading up on it at various insurance company websites, but the level of detail they provide is very limited, probably because it is illegal to advertise insurance products as investment vehicles.

I would like to be clear on how exactly, if at all, an IUL policy can be better from an investment perspective than say a 401k, IRA, or a simple traditional investment portfolio with no tax advantage.

1) Obviously no one is going to offer downside protection without requiring compensation, and my guess is that this particular feature is geared towards people who are either highly risk averse or gain an unusual amount of utility from never having to see a negative number in their annual statement.  My question is what sort of fees/expenses have people seen in these kind of policies?

2) What exactly are the tax advantages?  From what I've read, the cash value is not taxed on the back-end, but you pay into the plan after taxes.  Obviously everyone who understands the time value of money prefers a dollar today to a dollar tomorrow, all else equal.  So what exactly is the advantage here?  Are the gains also tax-free on the back-end?  How can you extract these gains before death?

3) Similar to #2, how does the borrowing aspect work exactly?  How is this different from just taking money out of your non-retirement savings and promising to pay yourself back x%?  To me this just seems like forced savings.  This idea of ""be your own bank"" just seems like a way for people who are bad with money to force themselves to save, with the insurance company as a middle man taking x% off the top.  Again, how is this different than investing all your money in a traditional portfolio and extracting money from it as you need it for other investment opportunities?

4) My understanding of insurance is limited to the perspective from investment theory.  Basically that, due to risk aversion and the shape of the utility curve, people are willing to pay for insurance even though it has negative expected value.  But this should only be to a certain extent unless someone is infinitely risk averse.  Since death is inevitable I don't understand how it makes sense to insure yourself through old age.  Is this mainly used as a method for wealthy people to pass on an inheritance without it being taxed?  Do you have to keep your IUL policy active your entire life?  Can your premiums, fees, etc. ever change and if you refuse to pay the higher costs can your plan be canceled?  Does it somehow also make sense for low- to middle-income families?",,False,,t5_2qhfj,False,,,True,t3_wpgp3,http://www.reddit.com/r/finance/comments/wpgp3/what_exactly_does_universal_life_insurance/,

He called chase to cancel the card due to a high interest rate (22%). When he did, the representative told him they couldn't provide him with a payoff balance and he needed to wait for the next cycle date. He did the next logical thing and attempted to pay over the current balance to avoid any more interest being charged and just get a small refund. They refused to accept any payment amount over what was stated on the last statement. He ended up paying the balance as of the previous cycle date, but was told he will have to call in on the next cycle date to pay the $1-$3 charged in interest since the last cycle.

When he told me about it I was in disbelief. I have worked in collections and finance and am quite certain they are capable of calculating an exact daily balance at any time. I told him it was probably just a clueless rep so we called Chase and talked to another employee (outsourced). She repeated the same information. They do not provide mid-cycle payoff quotes.

Problems:

* The job will include a LOT of cold calling which I'm not very comfortable with.

* I need to brush up on excel really badly.

* I don't especially want to BE a stock broker, nor do I have the ""personality type"" for it.  

I'm leaning towards taking the job for resume building reasons, but this isn't exactly the direction I want to take in my career.  Ultimately  would love to be a CFA but I know that's a long shot and I'll have to pay my dues beforehand.  Also, I fundamentally think that most individuals have no business actively and frequently trading hot stocks hoping to make a few bucks.

I'd hate to come into my role and have to quickly ratchet up writing skills, which unlike quant skills can take a while to develop. How much 'team work' is there, will I have a co-worker to bounce issues off of, or is it pretty singular work. Is there much presentation time, or is that pretty much an associate and VP only role?

I can work DCF's back to front, code VB, and understand a co-workers work in excel with relative ease. Is this enough, or is more of my workday spend on 'word' than I think?",,False,,t5_2qhfj,False,,,True,t3_f7qsm,http://www.reddit.com/r/finance/comments/f7qsm/average_workday_for_an_ibanker/,

JPM seems to be fairly cheap on P/E as well as tangible book value, at least historically. And the business trends seem to be favorable. Rising confidence and a stock market will probably lead to higher investment banking revenue. Recovery in housing should lead to more mortgage origination. NIM should increase once rates start to rise and the yield curve gets better, and Jamie Dimon's letter said that JPM is positioned to do well in a rising rates environment at the expense of current earnings. 

Regulation is somewhat opaque to me so if anyone can give me some insight on how that will affect the business/earnings I'd appreciate it. There seems to be a real push right now in Washington with the Brown-Vitter bill and some Fed officials including Bernanke talking about increased capital requirements.

I understand a little why the financial crisis occured: because of the housing bubble.  Banks would give mortgages to uncreditworthy people, sell these mortgages to other banks, who would then package these mortages into derivatives and sell those in the securities market.  This additionally drove up the cost of housing.  When a lot of those mortgages defaulted, the value of those derivatives fell.

Why did this affect the other sectors of the economy as well?  I can understand how construction of new housing came to a halt, nobody would give out new mortgages.  The derivatives became worthless, but only for the people who were caught holding them. 

I saw pictures of abandoned cargo ships in the ocean near China, and the article mentioned it was because of the financial crisis.  What do ships in China have to do with houses in America?

Or was it that just the housing sector took the brunt of the crash, while the rest of the economy just took a slight hit.

This differs from a hedge fund by virtue of the fact that we don't take investors--the profits are only paid out to owners and employees (bonuses ;) ). For those of you who haven't delved too deeply into the world of financial derivatives, [options](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance\)) and [futures](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_contract) are types of insurance that businesses may use to hedge the risk that they are exposed to by changing financial conditions. 

A simple example of a futures contract would be between a wheat farmer who's worried about the price he'll get in the Fall for his next harvest and a baker who's worried about what price he'll have to pay for wheat in the Fall when there's the risk of a wheat shortage. Both the farmer and baker can agree to enter a contract that says, come September 30th 2011, the baker will pay the farmer $X/bushel of wheat.

These types of standardized contracts [exist](http://www.cmegroup.com/trading/agricultural/grain-and-oilseed/wheat_contract_specifications.html). I don't trade corn futures/options--I trade interest rate futures/options. Explaining what I do and how I make money may take a while, so if you guys have questions about how/why this market works/exists I'll do my best to answer them. The market for financial derivatives is enormous: for an idea of scale, the notional amount outstanding for the interest rate swap OTC market is in the hundreds of trillions of dollars. Keep in mind that this is a notional amount based on the derivatives' underlying, but the scale gives you a sense for the importance these contracts play in stabilizing and providing liquidity for the loan market--I'd argue that without these types of contracts, interest rates would be higher and the economy would grow slower.

Many of the clients at my firm hold investments in a variety of marketable securities, but typically they are mutual funds (e.g 1,234.56 units of RBC Mutual Funds) and stock holdings in publicly traded corporations (e.g 1,000 shares of Microsoft).

Most of my exposure to investments is related to recording transactions and reporting them for financial statement and tax purposes, rather than being hands on with investment portfolio management.



My understanding of ROC is limited to the following:

*EDIT to add*: I have seen ROC on both mutual funds and shares type marketable securities, and these items are the only items i've seen ROC on. Bonds, GICs and the like, never.

It's a return of the original investment made by an investor, and it reduces the cost base of an investment.

It has no tax effect, as it's not ""income"".

I don't understand **why** a fund or publicly traded corporation would return capital to investors, especially to what amounts to small time investors who have no real stakeholdings in said fund or corp, other than that they have purchased said securities from a third party rather than directly from a corp during an IPO (i.e they didn't directly invest in a corp).


I've reviewed the Wikipedia page on ROC, and it's actually not very helpful in this regard.

Related questions:

Just to clarify: the corp or mutual fund that originally issued the marketable security is the entity paying the return of capital?

Is it possible for a publicly traded corporation to return more capital on a share issue than the original cost they issued the shares at?

For instance, say I buy a 30-year, $20000, no-tax bond, with a 5% coupon rate (yeah right in this economy, but its hypothetical).  That should give me $1000 a year for 30 years, with my principal returned at maturity.  The IRR, should be 5%.  The NPV, if we say market rates are 2%, is $13437 (hopefully I did this right in excel).

I got the into the final round of interview. So sorry to whoever was removed from the list. 

Treat informal interviews like a formal interview. You cannot be over prepared for an interview. 

The interview went very well. I met him in his office. We talked for over an hour. He introduced me to the VP I would be working under if I accept the offer. 

Oh top of this job I also got interviews from several commercial banks and investment banks (1 bb and 3 middle-market). 

So I will be very business the next few weeks. haha

I am honest quite shocked by the amount of the interviews I am receiving

---------------------------------------------
A few months ago I met and got to know the SVP in the corporate banking department of one of the big 4 banks. Evidently I impressed him some how, because he just offered to give me an informal interview for an analyst position that just became available in his department. (Note: I never expressed interest in working for him nor applied to the company)

I am not too familiar with informal interviews. Does this mean that I have a fast track to this position since it is a position he overlooks? 

What do I need to do to prepare for this interview that maybe different from formal interviews?

Still this explanation in the HBO mini-film ""Too Big to Fail"" sums up the events quite well:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuCoCHNCDkI

Still I don't understand all the details.

They state ""AIG expected housing price to go up, but they went down instead"".

What is confusing me, is when they talk about the teaser rate running out, they have to pay at a ""normal"" rate, but it is an adjustable rate.

So it means that at on point, consumers payments will depend on the market well-being. I can understand that if it is enough regulated and controlled, it can be acceptable, but one can easily predict it's a step forward more predatory lending, so it's not a big issue (yet).

My question is, how can you explain all consumers payments went up and defaulted at the same time ? Does it mean most consumers who were lent money defaulted, or did most defaults happened in a narrow time period ? If this market was not regulated enough, then why are there people pushing for criminal charges ? Isn't the government part responsible in this ?

With so much uncertainty about the economy, I feel like I should be taking a higher pay check now and forgoing the 401k. I don't have any confidence that my money will be there in 30 years, and if this is the case I lose more money contributing when I could be keeping it on hand.

Some people come here to read and learn, others come here to share opinions, etc.  Whatever your reason for being in this sub I believe we can better everyone's enjoyment and knowledge by holding people accountable for their content.

That being said, I have gone through my first round of deciding who should be an r/finance ""expert"".  If you see a member with a gold star next to their name, that now means that that user works in the finance industry or has demonstrated an extensive knowledge of finance.

Now, gold stars can be given and taken away.  If you bullshitted your way into getting one and it shows in your content, I can remove it.  We are on the honor system here as this is still the internet.  it will be hard to feign financial knowledge.  If you did try to lie and want to keep up the lie about being a financial expert, that will require you to do research to support any opinion you share, which in turn, helps the sub anyway.

At this time, I am done adding starred members.  I want to see how it goes from here.  If you are trying to attain a star, show that you are an expert in your content posted and you work in finance.

For starred members, congratulations.  In the coming days, I will be contacting each of you through PM to do an AMA within this sub so that we can learn about your job, industry, experience, schooling, etc.

If you are starred and you do not want to be, let me know so I can remove it.

You may notice that myself, pissin and wrecking all have money bags next to our name.  First, this is to show that we are moderators so we don't have to distinguish every single post.  Second, it is to show that we are also starred members.

Some background: I'm a wrapping up my sophomore year at UT Austin (McCombs). I'm double majoring in Finance and Economics, with a minor in Chinese language. I'm sitting at a 3.1 right now, should be up to about a 3.25 after finals this semester if everything goes the way I expect it will. I'll be looking for an internship in the fall.

Coming into school I thought I wanted to get into banking. After a few semesters it's become apparent that I'm not making the grades, and after a few of my friends going to work I don't think I want that life anyway. 

I've interviewed for a few shitty data-entry positions with some local firms in varying industries for the summer (not many people want to take a chance on a sophomore with a 3.1) and I'm waiting to hear back. 

I'm starting to think about oil though. McCombs has one of the better energy finance programs, they recruit heavily here, and the work-life balance is more in line with what I'm looking for. The problem is that living in Houston is a deal-breaker for me. My parents grew up there and I visit frequently (grandparents), and it is literally the last place in the world I'd want to call home. 

Can anyone tell me about oil finance opportunities outside of Houston? I know ExxonMobil is headquartered in Irving, but aside from that what is there?  What's the job market like? I know Shell has a really cush deal (as long as you put in 80 hours over two weeks and you can take every other Friday off), but is it the same with other firms? What are job opportunities like with the equipment manufacturers and suppliers vs. the refining companies?

Thanks for letting me outsource my career research!

1349188198.0,14,self.finance,10tfnx,"Some basic Enterprise Value questions. (r/investing was no help, so maybe you can best them.)",22,8,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/finance/comments/10tfnx/some_basic_enterprise_value_questions_rinvesting/,"So here's a simplified version of what I understand as Enterprise Value:

EV = Mkt. Cap + Debt - Cash

(Of course, ""market cap"" would also include value of preferred shares, ""debt"" would include all obligations and liabilities, and ""cash"" all cash-equivalent holdings.) 

Now here's my question. Imagine a company that has 0 debt. As that company's amount of cash on hand increases relative to its market cap, its enterprise value would seem to approach zero. In other words, to use an implausible hypothetical, if there was a company that had zero debt and had somehow accumulated cash equivalent to its market cap, then its enterprise value would be 0. But a company with no debt and lots of cash should be worth *more* because of those factors, shouldn't it?

I see why debt and liabilities must be added in the formula, since you're taking on those burdens if you buy the whole enterprise. And I see why it would make sense to subtract cash from debt, to mitigate that added responsibility. But when cash &gt; debt, I don't see why you still subtract cash. 

Wikipedia seems to say that it's because you'd have to pay out that cash as a dividend to the people whose shares you're buying. But why would you? Or is it that you subtract the cash from the ""market cap"" price tag because you could use the cash to buy the equity? But still, what happens in the admittedly outlandish scenario where cash = market cap or cash &gt; market cap? Can a company have an EV of 0 or negative something?

**More broadly, what does enterprise value mean in relation to market cap?** I know EV is meant to indicate the value of the whole company. At first, I thought that meant that a company with a market cap higher than its EV is overvalued on the market. Is that right? Or am I just not understanding what EV is for?

Basically I've spent the last four years on the premed track, graduating from UCLA with a BS in Neuroscience. It's been fine and I got a good score on the MCAT but there's been one issue that's been nagging at me for a few years now I have been drawn to is finance. Particularly financial analysis. I'm really starting to think that it's my calling for the following reasons:


1) For really no reason at all since my second year in college I've harbored an unusual interest in how to value common stocks, then preferred stocks, then bonds, then options, then REITS, and so on. 


2) The only books I've read since high school are the Intelligent Investor, the Intelligent Asset Allocator, Common stocks and Uncommon profits, The Snowball Effect, Security Analysis 1962 ed (like half, that shit is huge), The Essays of Warren E. Buffet, etc. 


3) Warren Buffet is my motherfucking hero (with Munger as his kickass sidekick). 


4) The only income I've ever had was a high school job at Round Table Pizza, but I've already endlessly planned and perfected how I am going to save for retirement. Fuck yea Roth IRAs.


5) Finding companies with high ROE, ROIC, and low P/B, P/E ratios literally gives me a boner (alright just figuratively)


6) I don't even care what I'm ultimately paid as long as I can sift through balance sheets all day and have enough money left over after living expenses to allocate some capitol of my own.




So what I ask of you r/finance is: Am I just a starry-eyed noob who's romanticizing finance because I haven't had any true exposure to the industry yet? Or should I stop dicking around and DO something about it? CFA level 1? Am I even qualified to search for internships?


If anyone has read this far, sincerely thank you.


EDIT: Let me shed some more light on the path ahead. Continuing the path toward medicine from here entails going 200k+ in debt, spending a year in the application process, four years in medical school, 2-3 years in residency, an additional 1-2 years in internship if I decide to specialize, and THEN I'll be set to start making bank (after paying of my loans that is).

You guys are all finance guys right ? So how about I take you all out for beer.... and you tell me broadly what a MSCF grad would do in the financial industry and when and how he fits in the system....

But first let me give you my background....

I'm new to the finance scene. I have a batchlors degree in computer science from a very reputed college and I was working in CISCO. Currently I'm working at a start-up company(having strong tie ups with SAP AG) that does data mining and analytics on Big Data. I'm really good at coding, especially C++. Math, Probability and Statistics are other area that I'm fairly proficient. I never lost a single mark in math, probability and stats exams. I won't say that I'm perfect though. I have my fundamentals in economic theories strong. I'm a ""partially-trained-newbie"" when it comes to finance though. 

I have been wanting to move into Finance, specially after 2008 crisis. The reason I joined a start up was because they performed analytics of data for finance firms, mostly(though there has been no hard-and-fast rule). I thought of getting to know the entire landscape of finance first and do an MBA eventually. 

But recently I came across MSCF program at CMU and similar programs in colleges like Columbia, Cornell, Princeton, MIT, BU etc. When I looked at the program structure, I thought this has the perfect mix of CS and Finance and Math. I felt that this is what I have been looking for... Oooh...also I wrote GRE quite recent and got 170/170 in quants and 154/170 in verbal and 4.5/6 in Analytical writing...

For instance, a stock is at $10 until someone from the market decides to buy 1,000 shares at $11, resetting the price.  The number I'm looking for here is 1,000*($11-$10)=$1,000.  Or, if someone decides to sell 200 shares for $9, 200*($9-$10)=$-200.

EDIT:

I should specify what I'm after.  I'm a buy-and-hold investor, not a day trader.  Sometimes I buy a stock and see it go down 7% the day after.  Well, fine.  I'm seeking stocks that change by +/- 100% to 1000% over five years anyway.  

Still, the speculation noise is annoying.  MACD gives a little insight into trends, but it rides off of price.  That's a little removed, as though we are trying to guess the throttle position of a car based on its acceleration.  I'd rather see an MACD of speculation, as measured by some combination of time-and-share data, to gage how much the big-wigs, day traders, or inside traders are disturbing* the price.

I haven't seen too many articles that really delve into why the employees were getting so much money, but I did read two or three articles (since lost the URL) that presented a story basically as follows:

Bell would go around and find state employees who were nearing their pension retirement. Maybe one or two years out from their retirement, they'd steal them away and give them a salary 3-4x what they were getting before. When the state worker finally retires, his pension is based on his last year of employment. However, which cities pay what portion of the pension seemed to be based on a formula as to how long the worker worked in that city.

So, for example, if I need 30 years of employment to get my state pension, I might work 28 years in (random city, CA). Then, Bell offers me 3x my salary, and I clearly go to Bell. Two years later, I obviously retire, and Bell gets the benefit of me living in their city and paying city taxes on my pension, a pension which is now based on my final year's salary of 3x normal. 

So who ends up paying? Well, the other city (or cities), wherever I worked before for 28 years. That city which maybe paid me $75k for 28 years now has to pay 28/30ths of my pension at $225k. Bell gets the benefit of me paying city taxes on my $225k pension for the forseeable future. 

Was Bell raping their own city's residents by overpaying me? No, at least it doesn't seem that way to me. It seems that Bell was actually exploiting an obvious loophole in the state pension system, and getting other cities to pay for it. For Bell, it's a great idea. Yeah, for two years you pay a huge salary, but if the people retire in your city, you collect taxes for the next 30 years on their wildly inflated pension. 

I'm not gonna lie; if I was a Bell, CA government official, I would have called the state's bluff, made clear our city's residents *benefited* from the transaction, and that if California wanted it fixed they'd need to do it at the state level or in the state pension system.

However, I'm currently taking one of my exams that deals with the Black-Scholes model and the Vasicek and Cox-Ingersoll-Ross interest rate models and have some questions.

I'm not really sure how to formulate this question, but I will give it a try.  So, all of these models seem to make a lot of assumptions regarding the marketplace, and I'm not even 100% sure how the models work in practice (i.e. constant volatility in the models is clearly presumptuous, constant rehedging to delta hedge in the face of transaction costs seems difficult).

But, deeper than that, the risk free rates of interest are all based in reality on Treasuries.  My first question is, does the Treasury yield curve ensure that there is no bond market arbitrage as there could be under some bond pricing models, and if the yield curves are based on market information, how does the market ensure that those bond prices do not allow for arbitrage?

Maybe more importantly, I'm not clear at all on how bond markets interact with stock and derivative markets to ensure that the risk free rates of interest allow for no arbitrage in either market?  I have always throught of them as two separate entities responding to two different sets of investors.  How do the two interact as they do in the Black-Scholes model in order to make sure that you cannot find arbitrage opportunities in the market?

Perhaps I'm confused or just missing something obvious, as I've just barely gotten going on my reading of the material, or perhaps it is the case that arbitrage is possible in markets in reality but closes infinitesimally fast when taken advantage of by a select group of investors.

Any insight is appreciated, as the material really interests me, but I'm just not sure how the mathematics apply to the real world.

EDIT:  A FOLLOW UP:

So I see that due to pretty simple reactions, arbitrage would close sufficiently fast to make it difficult, though not impossible, to take advantage of.  So here is my question about the current market:

If stock markets and the market for Treasuries have to interact in a way that does not allow individuals from take advantage of risk free interest rates that would allow them to take a position in assets and lend cash in a way that allows for arbitrage (or at least react to each other fast enough to close it quickly), and Treasuries are in part based in part on Fed funds rate (I believe?):  How does the Fed transparently informing investors of their zero lower bound strategy, and maybe more importantly delineating the conditions under which such a strategy would be lifted, come about to influence the opportunity for arbitrage and/or the market?  Wouldn't institutional investors, having knowledge of how the two markets interact, have enough information about (at least directionally) where yield curves are going, which would allow them to more accurately value options, and potentially take advantage of that situation?

Basically, are there issues with the Fed releasing information about their interest rate strategies in that this extra information impacts not just lending, but the wider market environment?",,False,,t5_2qhfj,1358424830.0,,Analyst,True,t3_16pqq1,http://www.reddit.com/r/finance/comments/16pqq1/potentially_stupid_question_how_do_markets_ensure/,

I have an urgent problem that I would love to get help with. 

I'm working on a project valuation sheet at work. 
1 - The sheet calculates After Tax Cash Flow for three years of the project.
2 - DCF for each year in discounted to current year

I understand so far (I Guess). But then in the Total Columns on the right, the After Tax Cash Flow row, takes the ATCF for 3rd year, and divides it by the Discount rate. (Discount rate is 10%, so effectively making it 10 fold). 

The next row for DCF then takes this 10fold value and discounts it to current value.

Question is - Why is the 3rd year ATCF being divided by discount rate??

I hope  I explained clearly. Thanks in advance!",,False,,t5_2qhfj,False,,,True,t3_10mgzs,http://www.reddit.com/r/finance/comments/10mgzs/urgent_help_please_after_tax_cash_flows_and/,

Looking for some input.,14,1,48,http://www.reddit.com/r/finance/comments/efbs4/experience_needed_for_entrylevel_employment/,"Recent finance grad here looking for some input - How do I break into finance if I have no professional experience?

My situation:

I graduated in May with a Bachelor's in finance and have been looking for employment since. Like many of my peers, I did not succeed in finding an internship my junior year. Due to obvious market circumstances coupled with a foolish mentality at the time of not wanting to settle for a position with a company I didn't really want to work for, I ended up with no experience. I see now that any relevant experience would've been invaluable even if the company name did not build my resume itself.

What I have done in the last six months:

I have combed through postings on career sites (Monster, Careerbuilder, etc.) and corporate career pages with no luck. I have created profiles with all the major finance staffing/temp firms in my area, only to hear back from one which has yet to come up with any position that fits my profile. I have contacted alumni from my school and have been met with little useful advice and no leads. 

I am beginning to think that finding a job will be a pure stroke of luck and has nothing to do with working hard to get there. I am running out of ideas as well as optimism. I have confidence in my career potential, but can't find a way to develop it. 

Why I'm posting this here:

Maybe someone here knows something I don't or has a piece of advice that could be useful. Maybe you're looking for someone like me. Maybe you are someone like me and this will give you solace in the fact that you're not alone. 

Thoughts?

I have some savings, but I had never really thought in the long term that much, usually short term problems.

I'm planning to take about 20%-50% of what I make at my job and stick it into a savings account; since I am very very fortunate to have parents mostly helping out with college and state tuition rates my job is basically just disposable income, so saving a large portion of it is very feasible.

What are the thoughts on accounts? I have a checking with ChevyChase/CapitalOne, would it be best to save with Interestplus Online Savings, or a different savings account, or another bank entirely? HSBC looked good.

What are some of the things I need to watch out for? They seem pretty high yield for a savings account, is there much risk?

My next question would be at what point should I start putting the money to use and investing it? Once it hits $5000, investing in 2 year government bonds or CD's? Or wait till I have $10000 to invest with? I am looking for low risk investments, I don't want to have to save it all just to go for a 50% chance of it disappearing.


Also, I was pretty shocked today when I realized that, as a student, I don't really have a credit score. I am wondering whether getting a student credit card with low/no annual fees and cashback, and paying it off as soon as I use it would be a good idea. Do I get charged interest if I use it even at all? Do I need to pay off interest to raise my credit score?

What are some of the pitfalls of credit cards? Does anyone have experience with the CapitalOne cards? If somebody could explain the ins-and-outs of exactly how a credit card works and what you have to watch out for, I would very much appreciate it.

The average investor believes the 2000 and 2008 and 2011 declines are/were temporary, and they are. But how temporary? It's been 12 years and we still are in decline if the dow is indexed in real US dollars. The dow only a few weeks ago was the same level it was in 2000, 2008, 2006, 2001, and 2010. A level which is measured in inflating dollars. Accounting for inflation we are at where we were in the early 90s and late 80s.

In recessions, as usual, investors realize they need to pull out into cash. More and more investors are realizing this is a lost decade or even a lost year or 4 years. They will want to step away for a few years. Then will quickly realize, or already knew, holding cash is just as bad of an investment. They will then turn to hedges against inflation, real assets, further devaluing the dollar. They will turn to commodities and energy the only things in the past decade besides entrepreneurial investments which have increased in value. Meanwhile, the fed *has* to print more money to account for the deflation of the recession, less they risk their debt becoming more expensive to pay off...further devaluing the dollar. Two fundamental forces acting on the increase in the value of assets. And there is a reciprocating effect, the more the fed prints the more incentive people have to leave the dollar the less businesses see real capital investors and the more deflation we see...Meaning the fed has to print more to account for it's debt starting from step 1 all over again. Hyper-inflation, as usual in the end of the fractional reserve banking cycle. The same thing happened in 1979 when silver prices were $100/oz and in 1938. And pretty much every 30-50 years since fractional reserve banking was first used (TMK) in the 13th century.

There is a notion in the investment community that gold and silver are the next big tulip crazes, and thus we should stay away. I think this is backwards, IMO the bubble is the *dollar* over the past 30 years and it's peak was in 2000 when gold hit rock bottom a symptom of the dotcom no less. You're partaking in the bubble by staying in dollars or the economy which is in recession, the *only* way out is real assets. Last one out is a rotten egg, and will be spending the rest of their lives regaining their lost value.

I'm 29, married, and plan on having kids.  I'm also self employed with no idea what tomorrow holds.  I live in a home we plan on staying in for the long haul, and refi'd last year to 4.75 fixed.

I've saved enough to knock our mortgage down to 100k from 130k.  If I do this, I'd effectively reduce my monthly mortgage payment by about 200 a month.  

I love the idea of cheap housing, and it doesn't get any more frugal than a nice home for under $500 a month, even when you consider about 3k a year in taxes and insurance, which I'd elect to forgo an escrow account and pay them once a year as they come due.

So my question to you is, what is the downside to such an approach?  I realize I could stuff this in some sort of IRA, but given my distrust of the stock market along with my uncertainty of future earning power, would the low monthly housing be the right move?

1363646211.0,12,self.finance,1ajy56,"[Book review] - The (Mis)behavior of Markets: A Fractal View of Risk, Ruin and Reward by Benoit Mandelbrot.",20,8,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/finance/comments/1ajy56/book_review_the_misbehavior_of_markets_a_fractal/,"This was a very thought provoking book that left me with a new perspective on financial markets, however the style that it is written in lets it down greatly. 

Firstly a little bit of background, Mandelbrot is a mathematician famous for developing the theory of fractals. This involves methods of describing irregular shapes mathematically, such as coastlines and abstract theoretical shapes. A core feature of fractals is that you can zoom in on them and they appear 'self-similar', for example imagine river networks where the main river has tributaries which in turn have smaller tributaries which themselves have smaller tributaries (and so on...). What he attempts to do in this book is apply this theory to financial markets. 

In the book Mandlesbrot sets out to portray two key points; that price charts are self similar and that prices don't vary in the conventionally assumed random manner.

The price charts point is fairly obvious to anyone who has been following financial markets for any reasonable length of time. Take away the time axis of a chart and you could really be looking at any time period. It is the second point that made me think and that led me to write this review, hoping to spark a discussion about it. 

What Mandlebrot basically says is that the widely held view that price varies randomly on a trade-by-trade basis is incorrect. If this did happen then a 5% fall in price today should have no effect on how the price changes tomorrow. What actually happens is that volatility clusters so when there is a big shock on any given day then the following days are more likely to experience price changes of that magnitude (direction isn't quite so predictable unfortunately). This again may seem fairly obvious to people following the market but theoretical models such as Black-Scholes and CAPM use the concept that price follows this random motion. If the stocks actually followed a gaussian distribution then the price should not vary as much as it does in real life. This gives us undervalued expectations of risk. 

In the book he suggests that price changes actually follow a power law. This results in the fact that a big change in price one day leads to a higher probability of a big change the next day as well. He states that different stocks obey power laws controlled by different powers. This means that some do move seemingly randomly in a gaussian distribution but others move much more wildly. It also means that if you were to try to predict a more wildly stock using a traditional method that you are likely to get caught out by large shocks. 

What do others here think of this? Is there a reason why incorrect theories are still so widely used? Does anyone work in finance and use his theories in a professional environment?

What I did not like about the book was the style Mandlebrot wrote it in. It come across that he is very bitter that few of his ideas really took off. He writes as though he is much smarter than you (which he obviously is) but that he is scolding you for having got it wrong for so many years. 

Overall I would recommend this book for someone interested in finance and maths however I would warn you that it is quite tough to finish. You pretty quickly get the jist of the book and then it is just endless examples of why he is right and everyone else is wrong.

I'm very concerned with the fragility of the market. It simple confounds me that everyone is celebrating the stock drive back to the peaks without any serious concern about the actual fundamentals. How is the global current account turn back positive? We don't have any alien trading partners to mooch off...how can we keep producing these crazy outputs for the sake of growth? 

China is a bubble. Anyone who disagrees is blind. Seriously, they have been building and developing for the sake of development. It's not planned, it's not logical and it's not sustainable. I think China needs the world to believe this lie so they can survive a little longer and the rest of the world needs this reassurance as badly as China wants to give it. So it's the perfect situation. 

ASIDE:
Once the baby boomers are out of the system and global economies have cooled down, how are we going to re-evaluate the commodities? Do we really need all this iron ore or OIL or Copper or Lithium or any other material.

It is usually agreed that as interest start to increase, the value of the currency would increase. We are witnessing this for the last few months in the US. US short term Treasury yields are increasing from 0.01% in January to 0.08% in March. US dollar is also increasing (1.36 to 1.30).
 
It is speculated that US will enter into an inflationary period. This speculation is based on the fact that interest rate in the US is kept low, superficially, for an extended period of timeAlso, now that interest rates are increasing based on market demand, the FED will not be able to control inflation successfully.

I don't understand how I haven't gotten the correct answer yet... This is the question:

&gt; You decide to buy 1,400 shares of stock at a price of $88 and an initial margin of 70 percent. What is the maximum percentage decline in the stock before you will receive a margin call if the maintenance margin is 35 percent?

My approach has been basically find the critical price and divide it by the original price. 

So, 1400 * 88 = 123200
123200 * .7 = 86240 (Equity)
Margin Loan is $36,960

Critical Price = (amt borrowed/#shares) / (1- Main. Margin)

So, 36,960/1400 = 26.4 
1-.35 = .65
26.4/.65 = $40.62

If $40.62 is the critical price and I divide that by the original purchase price of $88 wouldn't that give me the stock price decline? Which would be 46.15%.

What am I missing here? Also, Sorry if this shouldn't be here.

What I would really like is some kind of way to buy debt from a credit card/debt collection agency or some such other company that is in the business of controlling debt. Basically I'm wondering if there's a way to put up small amounts of money and then have some company do the work of collecting/charging fees, so that I could just collect a nice return.

I graduated with a BBA in Finance and a minor in Organizational Communication. I'm glad I found this subreddit because it looks everyone's fairly experienced in very diverse fields of Finance. I was hoping to get some advice on some career goals I've been making.

1) My long-term goal is to work in Mergers and Acquisitions. I've read up on the field but I'm hoping someone here can give a first or second hand account of what it's like to work in this field (i.e. how they got into it, top firms, mindset required for success, e.t.c)

2) I am currently working as a Financial Supervisor handling the Accounting/Financial Planning/Human Resources aspect of a small business. The work is challenging and a great experience overall but I worry that it may not be relevant to the field I want to go into, i.e. when I apply for jobs other applicants may have a more relevant experience than I do. Should I seriously consider switching over to a lower entry level position in a large firm or stick with this current position (small fish in big pond or big fish in little pond)?

3) For a graduate program, I am taking the advice of my advisors and enrolling in a Business Law program to complement my Finance degree as I was told it would be a huge leg up in the Mergers and Acquisitions field. What are your opinions on this?
