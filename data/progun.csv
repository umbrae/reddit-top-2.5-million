&gt;I feel bad because I'd love to get my rifle into as many police departments as possible...who doesn't want their law enforcement agencies armed with the best possible tools to take out the bad guys? I heard a rumor that the only other company with a .50 BMG semi-auto rifle in production won't sell to NY police agencies either. So because of a stupid law the venerable NYPD won't have the best tools for the job....

&gt;*******************************************
&gt;XXXX,

&gt;Yes, I got the message and tried to return the call but got no answer. I appreciate your interest in our BFG-50A; I'm sure it would be an excellent addition to your department's arsenal. Unfortunately, we have a policy of selling to state law enforcement agencies only what is allowed to be sold to private citizens in that state. Since the passage of the NY SAFE act, the BFG-50A is considered an assault weapon and as such is no longer available to private citizens in the state of New York. Therefore we have to respectfully decline to supply your department with BFG-50A rifles.

&gt;Regards,

&gt;Mark Serbu

Press Release: Olympic Arms, Inc. Announces New York State Sales Policy

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:
Olympic Arms is a staunch believer in and defender of the Constitution of the United States, and with special attention paid to the Bill of Rights that succinctly enumerates the security of our Divinely given Rights. One of those Rights is that to Keep and Bear Arms.

Legislation recently passed in the State of New York outlaws the AR15 and many other firearms, and will make it illegal for the good and free citizens of New York to own a large selection of legal and safe firearms and magazines. We feel as though the passage of this legislation exceeds the authority granted to the government of New York by its citizens, and violates the Constitution of the United States, ignoring such SCOTUS rulings as District of Columbia v. Heller - 554, U.S. 570 of 2008, McDonald v. Chicago - 561 U.S. 3025 of 2010, and specifically the case of United States v. Miller – 307 U.S. 174 of 1939.

Due the passing of this legislation, Olympic Arms would like to announce that the State of New York, any Law Enforcement Departments, Law Enforcement Officers, First Responders within the State of New York, or any New York State government entity or employee of such an entity - will no longer be served as customers.

In short, Olympic Arms will no longer be doing business with the State of New York or any governmental entity or employee of such governmental entity within the State of New York - henceforth and until such legislation is repealed, and an apology made to the good people of the State of New York and the American people.

If the leaders of the State of New York are willing to limit the right of the free and law abiding citizens of New York to arm themselves as they see fit under the Rights enumerate to all citizens of the United State through the Second Amendment, we feel as though the legislators and government entities within the State of New York should have to abide by the same restrictions.

This action has caused a division of the people into classes: Those the government deems valuable enough to protect with modern firearms, and those whose lives have been deemed as having less value, and whom the government has decided do not deserve the right to protect themselves with the same firearms. Olympic Arms will not support such behavior or policy against any citizen of this great nation.

Olympic Arms invites all firearms manufacturers, distributors and firearms dealers to join us in this action to refuse to do business with the State of New York. We must stand together, or we shall surely fall divided.

Sincerely,

Brian Schuetz
President
Olympic Arms, Inc.

I am working while listening, so I apologize if I got some of the details wrong.  Feel free to correct me and I'll edit the post... But I think this is what I just heard. 

* Possession of hollow point bullets and similar **assault bullets** a felony.
* **EDIT** Must register and report ammo purchases.  Only purchase max 500 rounds.
* ~~6 round magazine limit~~ -- **EDIT** Apparently it is the normal 10 round limit. 
* ALL magazines must be fixed to the gun (can not be removed without the use of a tool)
* 100% prohibition of all magazines greater than 10 rounds.  All previous grandfathered magazines become illegal. Felony if you keep one.  
* Changing definition of shotgun revolving cylinder -- Basically only single shot shotguns will remain legal.  
* Bullet Buttons will become illegal -- All AR and AK style rifles that are currently equipped with them will be designated Assault Weapons.  Felony to possess.
* All gun owners now must be licensed like drivers.
* All gun owners must carry gun liability insurance

Basically they have just proposed to make all semi-automatic weapons, as well as most shotguns, illegal.

Today we take to the phones, twitter and email to inundate the offices of every congress and senate member in the US. 

We will reach every rep.

We will overwhelm them.

We will be victorious. 

Here are your resources

**Email**

(Courtesy of the fine people over at Ruger) - Clicking this link will bring you to a pre-typed letter that will be messaged to ALL of your reps. Send it two or three times a day until further notice.

http://www.ruger.com/micros/advocacy/takeAction.html

**Phone:**

The bill will first be introduced into the Senate and the Democratic Senate Majority leader has already been hard pressed to allow a vote on this issue. **Call him first and let him know your opinion: Harry Reid (D-NV) (202) 224-3542**

As /u/Deradius bravely put it,

&gt;Reid is paying close attention to what will happen in the Senate. If he doesn't think he can get 60 votes, he'll prevent a vote on any gun control legislation, so as to avoid Dems ending up with an anti-gun vote on their record.

**We also have a few swing seats that will be up for reelection soon and this issue could cause them to lose their seats. Let's let them know that.**

Senate Swing Votes Who Are Up For Re-election in 2014:

Max Baucus (D-MT) (202) 224-2651

Mark Begich (D-AK) (202) 224-3004

Susan M. Collins (R-ME) (202) 224-2523

Kay R. Hagan (D-NC) (202) 224-6342

Tim Johnson (D-SD) (202) 224-5842

Mary L. Landrieu (D-LA) (202) 224-5824

Mark L. Pryor (D-AR) (202) 224-2353

Mark Udall (D-CO) (202) 224-5941

Tom Udall (D-NM) (202) 224-6621

Mark R. Warner (D-VA) (202) 224-2023

After you have called those above you should call your representatives and tell them to OPPOSE the assault weapons band and to not compromise on any further gun legislation.

Take to twitter with the following hashtag #2ARights (graciously suggested by our brother in arms [Gone Skiing](http://www.reddit.com/r/guns/comments/171okg/daylong_twitterbomb_in_response_to_feinsteins_awb/) Post videos, opinions and articles and kill that hashtag. 

We have many pieces in this battle and our voices will not be silenced. Fight for your rights and once this is over we will push to reclaim those rights that we lost due to ""compromise""!

&gt;There's just one problem with the 90 percent ""statistic"" and it's a big one: It's just not true.  In fact, it's not even close. The fact is, only 17 percent of guns found at Mexican crime scenes have been traced to the U.S.  What's true, an ATF spokeswoman told FOXNews.com, in a clarification of the statistic used by her own agency's assistant director, ""is that over 90 percent of the *traced* firearms originate from the U.S.""

Source: http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2009/04/02/myth-percent-small-fraction-guns-mexico-come/#ixzz2SiZsNKSx

Confirmed by NPR and Politifact (in case someone gripes about citing Fox as a source): http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=103224899

So how does this break down exactly? 

&gt;In 2007-2008, according to ATF Special Agent William Newell, Mexico submitted 11,000 guns to the ATF for tracing. Close to 6,000 were successfully traced -- and of those, 90 percent -- 5,114 to be exact, according to testimony in Congress by William Hoover -- were found to have come from the U.S.  But in those same two years, according to the Mexican government, 29,000 guns were recovered at crime scenes.  In other words, 68 percent of the guns that were recovered were never submitted for tracing. And when you weed out the roughly 6,000 guns that could not be traced from the remaining 32 percent, it means **83 percent of the guns found at crime scenes in Mexico could not be traced to the U.S.**

Source: http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2009/04/02/myth-percent-small-fraction-guns-mexico-come/#ixzz2SiadZiNq

So there you go.  Is it possible that some of the weapons that couldn't be traced *might* have originated in the US regardless?  Sure - I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of seized handguns originated in the US since they're easy to obtain and transport.  But the AK-47s, machine guns, grenades, and other staples of drug cartel warfare obviously aren't coming from Bubba's Buckshot Bunker across the border, and to imply otherwise is blatantly dishonest.

There are more. Just because you don't hear about them, doesn't mean they don't happen.
An armed citizen ought to have a pistol for concealed carry for self defense while out and about. And he ought to have free reign to pick whatever he likes to defend his home, for which the AR-15 is considered ideal, due to its maneuverability, light recoil (unlike shotguns), and the round's safety aspect of reducing overpenetration.

You ask why anyone would need an AR-15. Cursory testing will show that the 5.56 round actually penetrates less layers of drywall than shotguns firing slugs or pellets, and pistols. This is boon to people and their neighbors, who rest easier with the knowledge that their shots endanger bystanders and neighbors to a far lesser degree than shots fired using shotguns and pistols.

It is a very nice cake, with ""GUN RIGHTS"" written across the top in lovely floral icing. I received it from the 2nd amendment and the Dick act of 1902.

Along you come and say, ""Give me that cake."" I say, ""No, it's my cake."" You say, ""Let's compromise. Give me half."" I respond by asking what I get out of this compromise, and you reply that I get to keep half of my cake.

Okay, we compromise. Let us call this compromise The National Firearms Act of 1934.

There I am with my half of the cake, and you walk back up and say, ""Give me that cake.""

I say, ""No, it's my cake.""

You say, ""Let's compromise."" What do I get out of this compromise? Why, I get to keep half of what's left of the cake I already own.

So, we have your compromise -- let us call this one the Gun Control Act of 1968 -- and I'm left holding what is now just a quarter of my cake.

And I'm sitting in the corner with my quarter piece of cake, and here you come again. You want my cake. Again.

You say, ""Let's compromise once more."" What do I get out of this compromise? I get to keep one eighth of what's left of the cake I already own?

So, we have your compromise -- let us call this one the Machine gun ban of 1986 -- and I'm left holding what is now just an eighth of my cake.

I sit back in the corner with just my eighth of cake that I once owned outright and completely, I glance up and here you come once more.

You say nothing and just grab my cake; This time you take several bites -- we'll call this compromise the Clinton Executive Orders -- and I'm left with about a tenth of what has always been MY DAMN CAKE and you've got nine-tenths of it.

Then we compromised with the Lautenberg Act (nibble, nibble), the HUD/Smith and Wesson agreement (nibble, nibble), the Brady Law (NOM NOM NOM), the School Safety and Law Enforcement Improvement Act (sweet tap-dancing Freyja, my finger!)

I'm left holding crumbs of what was once a large and satisfying cake, and you're standing there with most of MY CAKE, making anime eyes and whining about being ""reasonable"", and wondering ""why we won't compromise"".

I'm done with being reasonable, and I'm done with compromise.

Back in 1990, when I was deployed in Desert Shield and Desert Storm as a Marine grunt, some companies prioritized me items for my M16 for shipping that I purchased with my own funds. After getting out and forming Magpul in 1999, I established the same priority policy for Military and Law Enforcement, due to the requirements of their profession.

The same policy has been in place for 13 years now and has never been an issue until a few days ago. I do not support the idea that individual police officers should be punished for the actions of their elected officials. That said, I understand the concerns that some have with Law Enforcement officers getting special treatment while at the same time denouncing second amendment rights to another citizen in the same state.

With the fight in Colorado right now we do not have time to implement a new program, so I have suspended all LE sales to ban states until we can implement a system wherein any Law Enforcement Officer buying for duty use will have to promise to uphold their oath to the US Constitution - specifically the second and fourteenth amendments - as it applies to all citizens.

We pass laws to show that we are moral. We lock up people to punish them for defying that morality, and then we tell the public everything is gonna be ok, because at least we are doing something.

This translates to making drugs and prostitution illegal, locking people up in prisons that do not rehabilitate them, and then taking away guns from law abiding citizens because it's ""the police's job"" to protect you.

I have thought about this for years. Frankly, it's the question of our time. Prohibition never ended, it's just that finally the shit has been hitting the fan, and we are still debating about band-aid solutions.

[Here's an article from the NY Post on the topic.](http://www.nypost.com/p/news/national/pro_gun_senators_take_heat_d5Ek5U4oLyGpP7tQnDzoVJ)

The media is building a narrative that these guys' poll numbers are dropping because of their votes, and Bloomberg is running ads.

They're trying to do to the pro-gun movement what we did to them after the 94 AWB vote:  Create a congressional sweep that makes gun rights untouchable, but they want to make **pro-gun** positions untouchable.

We can't allow this to happen.

Do everything you can to get this list of names and numbers visible, and call them frequently.  Post this at your local gun shop, on AR15.com, at Glocktalk.com, wherever else you need to send it.

They're hearing dissent on a national level right now, so they need to hear support on a national level.  Five of the six offices didn't ask me if I was a constituent when I just called; but if they *do* and you aren't a constituent, just say, ""No.  Please tell the senator he/she has supporters all over the country now because of his/her vote.""",,False,,t5_2vtr4,1367933812.0,,,True,t3_1duz9d,http://www.reddit.com/r/progun/comments/1duz9d/several_senators_are_under_tremendous_pressure_to/,

He's in California. If you look @ 1:20 in the video, you can clearly see that the magazine lock is mounted too far back, allowing the magazine to be detached without the use of a tool:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=XBXKYtD-AHs#t=78s

Combined with the fact that it's a semiauto, and that it has a pistol grip, he's filmed himself committing a felony.

He also mentions how he performed an improper demil. Thus, since California requires transfers of long-guns to be performed at an FFL, he illegally transferred the rifle when he left it for the ""garbage truck"":

&gt;Back in my garage I use a grinding wheel to cut the receiver in half and the other components into pieces. I put the scraps back in the cardboard box the kit came in and leave it for the garbage truck.

4am today, I awaken to thumping, and glass shattering.  My first thought is, ""Oh, shit!  Someone is breaking into my apartment!"" So I grab my pistol, scream, ""Hey, motherfucker!"" (I don't really know why those were the first words to come out, but I'll chalk it up to being half-asleep and sudden adrenaline) then take up a position, and get ready for insanity.  My heart is racing, I can hear it in my ears.  I wait a minute, and nothing happens.  I call 911, police are there in about 3-4 minutes.  PD gets here, I show them where the glass breaking noise was coming from.  Turns out, my upstairs neighbor has a stalker ex who busted through the second floor window with his bare hands (which was quite impressive considering there wasn't much to hold onto to get up there) and shredded himself to ribbons.  He walked into every room trying to find her, damn near bled out, then bolted and took himself to the ER.  Fortunately, he was busted at the hospital by PD.  PD told me he found her apartment by luck, essentially.  He didn't know her exact address.  I could have been faced with this meth-addled shit-head in my own apartment if he had chosen incorrectly.  This crazy asshole was only feet away from me, separated by my ceiling/neighbor's floor.  I just wanted to say that I am so incredibly glad to be able to own firearms in this country.  About 14 hrs ago, I thought I was going to have to defend myself with deadly force.  I'm glad I didn't have to.  I also wanted to send out a thank you to those of you who are PD/SO.  You guys get a bad rap, but you guys have saved my ass so many times (I'm an EMT).

PRISM has given the NSA access to basically all of our electronic data: emails, social networks, telephone records, etc.

i am somewhat surprised that this hasn't been brought up already in the media, though it's been hinted at in conversations i've witnessed over on /r/restorethefourth/

i'd suggest that if you are pro-gun, you should probably be pretty pissed off about this. this is the sort of thing that the NRA has fought long and hard to prevent.

perhaps you all might want to consider throwing your hat into the ring here, perhaps convince the NRA to get involved with some of the other movements happening right now.

Currently 4.7 MILLION letters have been sent through Ruger's website alone.

Do NOT support a AWB.  3. Do NOT support a magazine ban of any type.  Let them know the facts on these 3-points prove that new laws would be ineffective on crime.  Keep it short and sweet - as we all know it's likely just a tally-mark anyways.

I was listening to his interview on NPR this morning and they were talking about the bill he introduced that would limit the ""Stand Your Ground Law"" to *just your personal residence*. He said that the stand your ground law should be repealed to protect kids such as Trayvon Martin from being discriminated against. It never made it out of the committee BUT he is going to reintroduce it in the future. After doing some research I found more. Here are the bills that I found so far, all introduced in March of this year:



[HB 3325](http://www.legis.state.tx.us/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=83R&amp;Bill=HB3325) - Relating to the regulation or prohibition of certain assault weapons; imposing a tax and a license fee; providing a civil penalty.



[HB 3772](http://www.legis.state.tx.us/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=83R&amp;Bill=HB3772) - Relating to criminal history background checks in connection with firearm transfers; creating offenses.



[HB 3773](http://www.legis.state.tx.us/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=83R&amp;Bill=HB3773) - Relating to the use of deadly force in defense of a person or residence. 



None of these had made it out of the committee (yet) but Sheila Jackson Lee, a Democrat who also represents Houston, is also very anti-gun. After Sandy Hook she told Americans ""maybe you should turn in your guns."" There is so many things wrong with that woman it deserves it's own thread. These two both represent the largest city in Texas and the 4th largest in the nation. They do NOT represent their constituents and they want to make sure everyone follows what they think is ""right"".



I'm submitting this for visibility and so that those of us in Texas (mainly the Houston District) can keep this in mind when voting.

It looks like the Obama campaign has officially launched their gun reform website, with calls to action encouraging citizens to contact their legislators in support of the AWB and mag cap bans.

http://www.barackobama.com/gun-reform

We're no longer up against just the Brady Campaign or a few fringe senators on the left.  

We are up against the entire Obama election campaign apparatus; the same [billion dollar](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/12/12/obama-2012-campaign-spending_n_2287978.html) apparatus that [marshaled 65.9 *million* votes in the 2012 election](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_2012).   There are only 4.5 million people in the NRA, and its total annual expenditures are only about $231 million dollars.

He doesn't even have to get them to the polls.  He's just trying to get them to call their legislators.

Welcome to official underdog status, ladies and gentlemen.

If you've been sitting in the sidelines up until this point in time, it's time to get off the bench.  We need every single person we can get, or we're hosed for sure.

Step 1:   [Contact your reps.](http://www.reddit.com/r/progun/comments/176fyq/operation_burning_wires_phoneemailtwitter_strike/)

Step 2:  [Join the NRA](http://membership.nrahq.org/).  More members is better than more money.  

Step 3:  Have your friends, family, loved ones, and anyone you can convince to do it to do steps 1 and 2.

Step 4:  Educate members of the public.  Be an open advocate for second amendment rights.  **Take people shooting.  Take *everyone* shooting.  *Especially* people who disagree with you.**  Start them on step 1, above, and have them do steps 2, 3 and 4 when they're ready.

Michael Bloomberg's organization, Mayors Against Illegal Guns, has been spearheading the anti-gun campaign.

However, we've made considerable progress.

[MAIG has lost more than 50 members](http://www.nypost.com/p/news/national/weakened_arsenal_O4NRYKYmkSxmdBUC8na7yK), either due to failure to achieve re-election or active departure from the organization.

**How can you help?**

Check to see if the mayor of your municipality is on the list.  It's quick check, and the mayors of some fairly small locales are listed, so don't assume your mayor isn't listed.

[Here's the MAIG list, which is probably the most current](http://www.mayorsagainstillegalguns.org/html/members/members.shtml).

**If your mayor is on the list, call and tell them they won't be getting your vote, and you'll be telling all your friends and family about their MAIG membership.**

Check the cities of your pro-gun friends and relatives as well, and if their mayor is in MAIG, tell them to give their mayor a call!  (The easier you make it for them, the more likely they'll do it.

Senator, 

It is with a heavy heart that I write to you today. I have been a citizen of this great nation for 46 years and 17 of those as a law enforcement officer. I have seen our nation go through some tough times. On January 24th, 2013 Senator Feinstein with the support of President Obama has proposed the most draconian firearm legislation to date. The proposed law is not about safety it is about disarming and restricting the rights of all Americans. 

I swore an oath to uphold and defend the Constitutions of the United States and the State of Alabama. That oath means something to me. I swore before God, my fellow citizens, law enforcement members, my family, to protect them, to protect their rights and those precious documents. My swearing to defend these principles does not end with those who would pass such a law stripping current and future citizens of their right to keep and bear firearms. The motto of the State of Alabama is “We Dare Defend Our Rights”. I choose to defend those rights. 

If this proposed legislation passes and is signed into law it is a direct violation of the Constitutions of the United Sates and the State of Alabama. I will not obey it, I will not enforce it, nor will I participate with any organization or government entity in the enforcing of such a law. On that day I will move from being a long term law abiding citizen to a citizen who will not comply with the blatant infringement of our rights. 

Our Founding Fathers warned us about an overreaching tyrannical government. With great forethought they made sure the Bill of Rights included the 2nd Amendment as the only way to protect all the other amendments. No one can read that document and writings of the Founding Fathers and not know the true meaning of the 2nd Amendment. It is not about sporting purposes or hunting. It is for the defense of the citizens against harm and a government that no longer serves the people but wishes to strip them of their rights. 

I stood on the Capitol grounds in Montgomery on January 19th, 2013 with my fellow citizens and family members in support of the 2nd Amendment. I listened to speaker after speaker talk about what it means to be a citizen and what we have to do keep our people free. The speaker that moved me the most was my 16 year old son. He spoke about his rights, freedom and future. It is my duty as his father to standup and protect his right to live free and prosper. I will not shrink from this responsibility nor will I hide in the shadows of tyranny. 

I’m a Life Member of the National Rifle Association, my dad is a Life Member, my wife is a member and both of my sons are members. I will not comply, with any legislation that further restricts the rights of American citizens to keep and bear arms. 

Sincerely, 
Bama-Shooter",,False,,t5_2vtr4,False,,,True,t3_179ae3,http://www.reddit.com/r/progun/comments/179ae3/i_will_not_comply_ar15com/,

",168,27,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/progun/comments/18vww8/the_bill_that_will_spearhead_the_proactive_push/,"Gun bans aren't generally proposed by people who understand firearms.  Fear comes from ignorance.  Most of the recent anti-gun legislation introduced to the 113th Congress was sponsored or co-sponsored by representative Carolyn McCarthy, who famously identified a barrel shroud as [the thing that goes up](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ospNRk2uM3U).

Then we have Senator Feinstein, primary sponsor of the 2013 AWB, who has been photographed muzzling the crowd and with her finger in the trigger guard.

The US population is becoming increasingly urbanized.  Since the 1920s, more people have lived in urban settings than rural settings.  It's been a long time since we've had compulsory military service.

Millions of kids are growing up without ever having seen or touched a gun.  They're presented a model of government (through the education system) in which guns don't exist, and they're not permitted to defend themselves.  How do you think these people will vote when they grow up?

If people don't understand the safety rules we employ when using firearms (or don't even know that there are rules), of course they're going to think they're dangerous.

If people don't understand the mechanism of action of modern firearms, of course they're going to be afraid they'll 'go off by themselves'.

If a person has never touched a firearm and has no idea what the proper use of a firearm is, of course they're going to be more than happy to vote that liberty away in exchange for a comforting illusion of safety.

**In the Texas legislature, H.B. No 1142 has been introduced, which proposes to allow for an elective course in second amendment history and proper firearms use.  [Here's a link to the text.](http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/tlodocs/83R/billtext/pdf/HB01142I.pdf)  We need similar legislation nation wide, and the time to push for it is NOW.**

People feel the need to do 'something'?  **This** is the something we need to do.

Anti-gun folks will have a hard time arguing against it, because it's:

- A proactive solution to the problem.
- More firearms training has been linked to fewer firearms accidents.
- Education focused.
- Elective.

**This** is what we should be pushing as the alternative to gun control measures.

The mantra should be, **we don't need gun control, we need firearms education**.

**Ask your state and federal reps to introduce bills similar to TX HB 1142.**

[Here's how to get in touch with them.](http://www.usa.gov/Contact/Elected.shtml)

This should also be what the NRA is pushing for on a national level.

[Here's how to get in touch with the NRA.](https://contact.nra.org/contact-us.aspx)  Tell them to endorse this legislation and push for more of  the same.

....Whoever controls the education system wins the hearts and minds of the next generation.  Right now, kids are getting suspended for making gun shapes out of their chicken nuggets.  How do you think those kids are going to vote when they grow up?  Call your reps.

&gt;Ladies and Gentlemen, 

&gt;The letter shown below is from DCJS but was distributed by a Law Enforcement Association to all it’s members. I’ve removed the Association’s information to protect our source but wanted to show you the depths to which we are falling. Orwell was right; just 29 off years on the date! 

&gt;Tom King 









&gt;The Letter 



&gt;&gt;At a time when all of us are finding ourselves doing more with less, a reminder about a resource available from New York State that can assist you in your efforts to solve cases, prevent crime and better serve and protect your communities. 

&gt;&gt;The state has established a toll-free tip line – 1-855-GUNSNYS (1-855- 486-7697) to encourage residents to report illegal firearm possession. The tip line also allows for information to be submitted via text – individuals can text GUNTIP and their message to CRIMES (274637). While the state will provide the administrative support and fund the rewards, the investigation and validity of the tip will be up to each local department. 

&gt;&gt;To spread the word about this free resource, New York State is planning a comprehensive campaign, including public service announcements that will air on television and radio stations across Upstate. 

&gt;&gt;The tip line can provide your agencies with another avenue for receiving intelligence about crimes being committed in your jurisdictions. This initiative is designed for communities where no tip lines are in place and is not meant to replace existing gun tip lines. 

&gt;&gt;Here’s how the tip line operates: 

&gt;&gt;The New York State Police staff the tip line 24 hours a day. Upon receiving a call, troopers will solicit as much information as possible regarding a firearm tip, while allowing the individual to remain anonymous. The caller will be informed that this program is not the traditional gun buyback program but rather is focused on identifying individuals who are carrying an illegal firearm. 

&gt;&gt;The State Police will in turn contact the appropriate police agency with the lead to initiate an investigation. Staff from the Division of Criminal Justice Services (DCJS) will follow up with that agency to determine the validity of the lead. Once the investigation is completed, the police agency would convey to DCJS the outcome of the investigation. 

&gt;&gt;If the information leads to an arrest for the illegal possession of a firearm, the “tipster” will be awarded $500. DCJS staff will handle all of the financial transactions. 

&gt;&gt;State Police staff will explain the program in its entirety upon notifying an agency that a lead has been generated for their jurisdiction. If you have any questions in the interim, please contact DCJS Deputy Commissioner Tony Perez in the Office of Public Safety at 518-485-7610.

**Suggested Subject:** [source3](http://www.grnc.org/grnc-alerts-archive/419-grnc-alert-2-9-2013-larue-tactical-takes-a-stand-for-second-amendment-rights)

If it’s illegal for us, don’t sell it to police!

**Suggested Message** Please change it up a bit. Add some of your own words.

Recently New York rushed an ill-advised and unconstitutional law infringing on the rights of law-abiding gun owners. Other states are poised to write similar laws. I urge you to follow the lead of LaRue Tactical which has adopted this policy: If it can’t be sold to law-abiding citizens, it won’t be sold to state and local police agencies either. 

There are 800,000 sworn police officers in the entire United States. The FBI reports a total of 2,495,440 NICS checks, and thus firearms sales, in January alone. Police sales are not your major business. It’s time for firearm manufacturers to send a clear message that you will not participate in the slow erosion of our Second Amendment rights.

(NICS numbers Source http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/nics/reports/20130205_1998_2013_monthly_yearly_totals.pdf)


Signed,

A Concerned Gun Owner

He cannot bully or guilt them into acquiescence without their express consent. Senators and Representatives are supposed to act as a check on the Executive Branch. If your senator votes to infringe on your and my second amendment rights, you have the authority and responsibility to remove them from office through the appropriate process.

The recall process varies by district, but by and large you primarily have to have enough signatures on a form that states the reason for the recall. They have to be eligible to vote and live within the political district in question. You'll need their name, signature , and address, A phone number and e-mail address can be helpful for verification, but aren't always required. Call the office of an opposing political party for the person whom you want to remove. They should understand the process in your area, have a vested interest, and can mobilize people to help. Don't forget to reach out to Libertarian groups - they will be behind you on this issue. Make sure you follow the appropriate process or you will be wasting your time.

Contact local gun shops, gun ranges, sporting goods stores, or any places that sell hunting licenses. Ask their management to help in any way they can. Ask them to post a notice on their website and social media channels and have them ask their staff to alert customers. Specifically talk to the manager in charge of the area that sells ammunition at larger chain stores. All these people may be able to collect signatures during the checkout process at their establishment. Contact the management for gun shows in your area about having a table at the door or a booth inside at each show. 

When you have the locations set and forms in place where people can sign their support - it is time to advertise. Place handbills on car windshields in sporting goods shop parking lots and retail outlets. Post notices on Craigslist with the locations where people can go. Post to Facebook pages and twitter feeds of major businesses and use common hashtags including #nra #2a and any others you see where people open to defending their rights will see them. There are regional and national forums online where you can post messages to get people motivated. There are news aggregation sites with niche audiences. Don't forget about reddit.com/r/progun and  reddit.com/r/gunpolitics. Connect with groups on meetup.com or similar community connecting sites. Post in the comments of news stories about gun control on national and local news sites and blogs. Anywhere you see people talking about this - let them know what you are trying to do. 

Once you start seeing results send a press release to each of the news outlets in your area. Call them and get the appropriate e-mail contact from the main operator for sending press releases to their newsroom's assignment desk. Make direct contact with an assignment editor or a general assignment reporter through social media to get your information out. If they have an outdoors or community section that would be the best option. If you aren't experienced in dealing with the media - don't answer questions you aren't prepared to answer. Don't agree to an interview if you don't know what you are doing and don't have a prepared statement that has been vetted by people who understand how to talk to media DON""T be baited into appearing on camera or giving an interview.

Don't they stand to lose too? I think we should be getting everyone on board with this. These bans will limit their sales as well. I am a firm believer that we vote with our wallet and think Ammo manufacturers canceling government orders would be the biggest eye opener/message we can possibly send to the capitol. What do you guys think?   Should we start contacting Ammo manufacturers?

**Edit 1**: Thanks to MrTorben and hack6500. Here is my first draft. We need to send this to anyone who will listen. It may seem like a battle that can't be won but I truly believe there are like minded individuals who believe in the spirit of our bill of rights are can make a difference. 

*To whom it may concern and for your consideration.
I am a firm believer that “We the People” not only vote at the polls but also with our wallets. Several companies have already made a pledge to stand with the people behind our 2nd Amendment and would ask you to join us in our fight to preserve it by any means necessary. We live in a world where people and corporations are no longer guided by principle. Instead, by greed and the best interest of shareholders. Myself and many others are in full support of ANY munitions or firearms manufacturers who boldly stand with us and pledge to support them exclusively while refraining from purchases from those who are not.
We don’t live in a police state. If it won't be sold to citizens, it shouldn't be sold to State and local governments.
Please consider stopping the sale (where possible) of firearms and ammunition to Government and Local law enforcement in those places that have, or will make criminals out of law abiding firearms owners (CA, IL, NY, NJ, CO, MD, MI, etc)!

Here is an article featuring me and detailing the issue: http://5newsonline.com/2013/01/20/ua-student-proposes-lawful-conceal-carry-on-campus/

In Arkansas; these requirements are as follows:
-21
-training course
-certified proficiency in weapon by state licensed instructor
-pass all federal and state background/psych checks

I know this may seem trivial, but it really impacts students like me who are left disarmed and vulnerable in a place that is a magnet for crime because of its ""gun free"" status. 

I'll link to the articles, the facebook group that supports my bill, and the write the student government senators link. I realize that this isn't as important as the national level stuff, but I need help and my university needs help. These kinds of victories are important. Here's an argument by one of my friends, a veteran, as to why he should be allowed to carry (makes good talking points): 

""Concealed carry is already legal in Arkansas, as it is in 48 other states (to some extent).These bills are not trying to change who can carry a concealed firearm, but rather point out that the only people prevented from bringing one onto a college campus are those who have no intention of breaking the law in the first place.

Licensed, law-abiding adults, including students, faculty and the many law enforcement officers, and military veterans who attend college, carry concealed firearms for self-defense almost everywhere else in their lives, from restaurants to gas stations, without incident. Statistically, I can guarantee that you come into contact with at least one every single day. Why would their responsible behavior suddenly change when they cross a line onto a college campus?

We are not trying to replace campus security or the police. Nor does carrying a firearm negate the need for other safe behaviors, rather it enhances the need because of the consequences of having to defend yourself. However, police forces, by nature, are reactive and most of the time are not able to stop a crime. The only people guaranteed to be at the scene are the criminal and the victim, yet ""gun-free zones"" ensure that only one of them will have a weapon. Why not give people the option of a defensive firearm as a last resort rather than curling up on the ground and praying that they aren't killed or seriously injured? Why not give that potential rape victim the option of stopping her attack?

200 campuses in 6 states currently allow concealed carry on all their public campuses, and have not seen the spike in violent crime, gun crime or suicides that critics predict. If allowing concealed carry on campus doesn't have these negative effects, and, as statistics show, results in a decrease in crime, what is the downside?""

Respectfully,
Joe Youngblood

But here's 13 other surveys, conducted by numerous and legitimate polling/research organizations like Time, CNN (we all know CNN is basically the NRA part 2, right?), and Gallup, all estimating *annual* DGU's at ~800,000 to 3,600,000:

Here's a good wiki page on DGU's: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_gun_use

Even the **low** estimate is 55,000-80,000. Further, the **National Crime Victimization Survey** in 1993, conducted by the **Department of Justice of the United States** (that really pro-gun organization pushing their views down our throats!) estimated over 100,000 DGU's per year.

I made this because I saw several threads in GrC and /r/politics where people ridiculed the Kleck study and, because of that, they concluded DGU's were essentially non-existent. I even saw one person saying that the numbers were probably below 1000, due to the fact that there are only several hundred *lethal* DGU's reported to the FBI each year. That is obviously complete and utter bullshit.

Lastly, I'd just like to remind everyone that even the lowest estimates of ~55,000 are 5 times more than the ~11,000 ([2010 data](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_violence_in_the_United_States)) times guns are used in homicides in the U.S.

Oh, and your friendly moderator had a DGU of his own several years ago, where fortunately the mugger practically shit himself when my Walther came out and I didn't have to pull the trigger :)",,False,,t5_2vtr4,1361415925.0,,,True,t3_18xb4k,http://www.reddit.com/r/progun/comments/18xb4k/a_lot_of_the_antigunners_have_recently_begun_to/,

*The AR-15 is designed to be held at the hip to quickly spray bullets everywhere.  (where do they get this stuff?)
*If we can save just one life then we owe it to them to try to pass this bill.   (I could say the same in regard to banning cars, skateboards, or swingsets).

I was glad to hear them make heartfelt appeals for people to get behind this bill to support it.  Tells me they believe they NEED this support.  We need to do the same in opposition.

It's been a month since our last major campaign (Operation Double Down).

In that time, President Obama has redoubled his effort, [giving speeches that attempt to shame the senate into adopting gun control](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/03/28/obama-moves-to-hame-congress-into-approving-gun-control-package/).

Throughout, it remains abundantly clear that [the people who believe that guns are inherently unsafe know nothing about how to use them safely](http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/mar/25/miller-mayor-bloombergs-irresponsible-gun-attack-a/?page=1).

The call should be brief and to the point.  You're talking to an intern who is just writing down your position.  ""Please encourage Senator X to oppose any new gun control measures and to join Senator Paul's filibuster of any new gun control legislation.""

[Find your Senators here.](http://www.senate.gov/general/contact_information/senators_cfm.cfm)

You can also use the GOA tool to send them an e-mail about this, but *please* call as well.  They need to hear our voices.  [E-mail link.](http://capwiz.com/gunowners/home/)

If your Senator *is* in on the filibuster, call 'em up and give 'em an ""'attaboy!""  They need our support, as they'll be under a lot of pressure from the White House and elsewhere.

**II.  Get your friends and loved ones involved.**  If they're like minded, get them to call like you did.  Get your husbands, wives, sons, daughters, brothers, and sisters calling.  Let them know how important this is to you.  If they're not like minded yet, take them shooting.  Educate everyone you can.  The senators need to hear from as many *different* voices as possible.  

**III.  Call senators who are on the fence about gun control and let them know where the people *really* stand.**

**IV.  Join the NRA, and get your loved ones to join as well.**   [Here's the link.](http://membership.nrahq.org/)   Yes, I know a lot of you don't like the NRA.  The problem is, we're up against [the Obama election campaign](http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2013/01/obamas-campaign-turns-to-gun-control/), the billion dollar machine that marshaled over 50% of the popular vote in 2012, alongside the nationwide advertising effort being pushed by mayor Bloomberg and Mayors Against Illegal Guns.  Their explicitly stated purpose is to convince the senate that the majority of us support gun control.

By comparison, the NRA, the biggest pro-gun group, has an operating budget for one year of about $212 million (1/5th the Obama election budget), and they have about 4.5 million members.  Make no mistake, we are officially the underdogs, and we are absolutely outgunned.  The last thing we need to do is divide ourselves or fragment over ancient internal disputes, so my advice is to bite the bullet, deal with the junk mail, and join the NRA (and sign up anyone who will join) so that they can claim larger and larger membership.  I'm less worried about money than I am about headcount.  America (and particularly the political class) needs to see that there are still a lot of people who support and value the second amendment.  Senators care about power, and votes are the currency of power.  If they don't understand your phone calls, they *will* understand a group of 5, 6, or 7 million unified and motivated voting citizens.

We also deserved a vote, Mr. Obama, 
but we didn’t get it from Harry Reid!
Stockman, Broun answer the call to
KILL ALL GUN CONTROL in the House
 
Note to Barack Obama:  Spare us the snide sarcasm and the dripping contempt.  Obama's condescending state of the union speech shows, once again, why gun owners don't trust him.
 
""They deserve a vote,"" hollered Obama, pointing to drooling anti-gun activists in the galleries. 

Well, so did we. 

Veterans deserved a vote on whether they would receive due process from a court of law before having their constitutional gun rights taken away.  But, when Senator Chuck Schumer threatened to filibuster the DoD authorization bill in order to block that amendment, it didn't happen. 

Gun owners deserved a vote on Sen. John Thune's reciprocity legislation -- allowing concealed carry holders to carry their firearms from one state into another.  But Democratic Leader Harry Reid made sure each controversial bill coming before the Senate was filled with the maximum number of allowable amendments, so Thune's amendment couldn't be offered. 

Gun owners deserved a vote on appropriations language to block 16,000 IRS agents from imprisoning those who refused to comply with the anti-gun ObamaCare law.  But Reid carefully manipulated the Senate rules to insure the ObamaCare-related votes were kept to a minimum. 
 
From responsible budgeting to gun rights, Reid's office became the graveyard for votes on issues of interest to conservatives.
 
Reps. Stockman &amp; Broun circulate letter to KILL ALL GUN CONTROL
 
So what can gun owners do?  We can create a groundswell of support for what Rep. Steve Stockman (R-TX) is doing in the House.
 
Rep. Stockman has just told GOA that he and Rep. Paul Broun (R-GA) will be circulating a letter asking the House leadership to refuse to bring up anti-gun legislation that is NOT supported by a majority of the Republican members of the House of Representatives. 
 
Stockman’s effort could potentially kill ALL GUN CONTROL in the House. 
 
We know, we know.  We believe that gun control should die if only one constitutionalist-representative opposes it -- or even if none do.  But, as a practical matter, if 117 congressmen sign a letter demanding that Boehner not bring up a gun control bill opposed by those 117 congressmen, gun control will die.  Without that letter, Democrats will join with anti-gun Republicans, and gun control will pass.

&gt;“And one of the challenges that we have is that some of the most effective fighters within the opposition have been those who frankly are not particularly [friendly] towards the United States of America, and arming them willy-nilly is not a good recipe for meeting American interests over the long term.”

&gt;""And the people who are being suppressed inside of Syria who develop into a military opposition — these folks are carpenters and blacksmiths and dentists. These aren’t professional fighters.

Edit: looking for more info on this I also found this [LINK](http://okgrassroots.com/?p=352973) that shows some of the other proposals by Senator Dahm.

1357341157.0,101,self.progun,15z687,Obama administration has killed at least 8.9 times the number of children as Adam Lanza,132,31,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/progun/comments/15z687/obama_administration_has_killed_at_least_89_times/,"According to [this](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/robert-greenwald/us-drone-strikes-are-caus_b_2224627.html) and many many other sources, both official and unofficial:   Many times more children have been massacred by this president, than were killed by Adam Lanza or any other shooting spree I know of (just completely innocent children mind you. . . not even counting the hundreds or possibly thousands of adults who have been slain, for dubious causes)

Why am I posting this here, when it doesn't have anything to do with guns or gun control?

Because next time any politician calls for, or supports any form of gun control, whatsoever; it is incumbent upon us to remind them and our fellow citizens that;  Even IF there were any validity to claims that fewer guns result in less violence or death - the fact is that any politician or appointee within any branch of the federal government who has not explicitly renounced these drone strike, and who has not fought against all immoral and undeclared wars, or who has in any way voted to directly or indirectly finance these actions or make them possible - then they are guilty or complicit in the murders of many more children and many more human beings, in fact, than all the news-worthy shootings which presidents have shed tears over since the founding of the United States of America.

This is not about political parties (I would say the same thing to George Bush, or just about any other Republican or Libertarian politician). . . this is about [political means](http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=1662&amp;chapter=36963&amp;layout=html&amp;Itemid=27).

Next time you have a friend or co-worker who simply won't listen to reason, or the overwhelming facts regarding the actual outcomes of gun control;  try this on them-  Tell them you'll seriously consider allowing guns to be controlled. . . when the ones calling for it and writing the legislation are not murderers and accomplices to murder on a massive scale.

Furthermore, a government ban on guns and effective enforcement of such would necessarily entail government agents using actual violence against otherwise peaceful people, and threatening violence against the whole of society.  I think they'd be surprised how many people will not comply or submit, and who will exercise self-defense if attacked by men in blue or black costumes claiming to have the moral authority to enforce immoral legislation.  I hope that we would all also be pleasantly surprised at the numbers of those previously wearing the blue or black costumes who would take off those costumes or refuse to enforce those laws which are immoral and victim-less crimes.

Governments in the 20th century alone have [killed](http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/20TH.HTM) over 100 million human beings, NOT INCLUDING WARS.

I foresee no time or season or scenario in which guns should or ever will be outlawed on this land;  but if that time should ever come. . . .let's make damn sure it is not at the whims of any government;  the hypocrisy of this act would be an affront to all reason and morality. 
 
I realize that this sub is supposed to be dedicated to more factual and straight-forward submissions regarding gun control . . . . I understand that it may seem like I'm making an emotional appeal.  I would however be more than happy to link to many more sources for most of my claims, and those claims which are not readily apparent by empirical data, I am happy to discuss the logic or deductive reasoning inherent.

&gt;Dear Defender of Civil Liberty:

&gt;Rally – 11:00 Lawyers Mall ( this is the courtyard in front of the State House, bordered on the other side by the Senate and House office buildings)

&gt;Gun bill Hearings- 1pm Miller Senate Building, Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee Room. ( 11 Bladen Street- when standing on Lawyers mall with your back to the State House, Miller Building is across the street on the left)

&gt;Hearing schedule:

&gt;*  [SB 228](http://mgaleg.maryland.gov/2013RS/bills/sb/sb0228F.pdf)    Sen Frosh, et al    Criminal Law - Use of Handgun in Crime of Violence or Felony - Statute of Limitations
&gt;*  [SB 266](http://mgaleg.maryland.gov/2013RS/bills/sb/sb0266F.pdf)    Sen Frosh, et al    Rgltd Firearms - Database - Applications for Dealer's Lic - Rcd Keeping and Reporting Reqmts
&gt;*  [SB 281](http://mgaleg.maryland.gov/2013RS/bills/sb/sb0281F.pdf)    The Pres, et al          Firearm Safety Act of 2013
&gt;*  [SB 420](http://mgaleg.maryland.gov/2013RS/bills/sb/sb0228F.pdf)    Sen Frosh, et al     Crimes - Restricted Firearm Ammunition - Prohibition on Possession and Use

&gt;If you are testifying: Please arrive as early as possible to sign in, the committee will take sign ins until about noon. You will be given 3 minutes to speak.

&gt;If you are submitting written testimony you must bring a copy for each of the Senators who sit on the committee (20 copies) and submit them to Committee staff before noon so they can make sure all of the Senators have the materials on their desks.

&gt;I have [attached an updated version of the fact sheet on SB 281](http://marylandshallissue.org/share/SB0281_pamphlet.pdf) that can be made into a pamphlet (print two sided) – Thanks owed to Maryland Shall Issue for picking the bill apart and putting together the information. I know they are constantly going over the bill and finding new ramifications and so we are getting information on a steady basis which I will forward to you.

&gt;Please bring your signs, but please note it  is prohibited that signs are attached to sticks or poles of any kind, and signs will not be permitted inside the buildings.

&gt;There is parking at the Naval Memorial Stadium and the Shuttle will run from 7 am to 9pm and typically run every 15 minutes. It is approximately a one mile walk across the Weems Creek Bridge and to the Miller Senate Building/Lawyers Mall area.

&gt;There are continued rumors and speculation about the President being in Annapolis on Wednesday.- I want to assure each of you that the RALLY and HEARING is proceeding as scheduled. I have confirmed with DGS police that everything is in place and no one will be made to leave or denied entrance into the Lawyers Mall Courtyard or the Senate and House Buildings.

&gt;We do know that the President will be coming to the Westin Hotel to address US Senate Democrats at their Congressional Retreat. We expect West Street to be closed. Plan of coming by way of Route 50 to Rowe Blvd and parking at the Navy Memorial Stadium. In the event that the shuttles are running slow, and you would like to walk, it is roughly a 1 mile walk from the stadium parking lot to Lawyer’s Mall and Miller Senate Building.

&gt;Please do not let this discourage your participation, we need every able bodied person here to come and speak up in defense of their natural right to self defense!

&gt;Be prepared to spend the whole day here, whether you testify or not, what is important is that we are there in numbers to stand in opposition. We need thousands of gun owners. 

&gt;Constitutionally Yours,

However, for whatever it's worth, I work closely with law enforcement and emergency managers as a function of my job.  This includes representation from multiple counties in my area. 

At least 2 police chiefs, an emergency manager, and several beat officers have said to me that they took an oath to defend the Constitution and they will therefore refuse to conduct confiscation or enforcement of any policies related to registration, as a result of the recently proposed legislation.  

A police chief I talked to today said that if a law such as the recent proposed Illinois gun ban were to be put into effect, he would refuse to send his officers on confiscation calls, calling the effort ""a suicide mission"".  Frankly, I can't blame him.  

If nothing else, I say this to remind you that new gun control is a divisive issue even among law enforcement, and there are many good people in this field who understand the Constitution and intend to defend every word of it.

---------------------
I have been a long time reddit lurker and a somewhat recent redditor.  I do not post much and over 90% of what I post is a comment in someone else's post.  I feel I have made some good points, but they tend to get buried rather quickly, so I thought I would post a new topic and see if anyone was interested in a discussion.
--------------------
/End Introduction

I believe the current attack on our gun rights is an attempt to begin the process of removing them completely.  They want us disarmed.  I do not see any reason that the government would have any interest in an armed citizenry, from their perspective it would be beneficial to have it removed.

Our system of government was created to be somewhat unique.  Revolutionary, even.  It is designed as a Representative Republic where the people elect from their own peer group someone to represent them to the nation.  This representation was designed to expire.  I do not believe that our fore fathers (FF) expected that it would become a full time job for someone, rather that we would elect doctors, lawyers, farmers, ranchers, miners, cobblers, policemen, teachers, and the like, to office and when done they would return to that profession, satisfied that they had done their duty to the nation.  That is no longer the case.  Now we have politicians.  It does not seem to matter what they did before they ran for office, once elected they become politicians.  They become ""the government"".

This is the core of the issue.

We elect the same people over and over again to do the terrible job they are doing ""representing"" us and expect the result to change.  Because we no longer elect from our own peer group and instead elect from a pool of politicians we have designed a system by which once elected always a member.  

We have created a nobility.

We have created a ruling class.  This is a class very similar to the nobility of old.  Some have money, some do not.  Some have grand estates, some do not.  All have power.  Power over other people.  Power over you and me.  All are members, and may even retire from government service, but forever retain some of that power (sometimes a great deal) because of the favors owed and memory of the power they wielded.

A nobility by itself is not horrible.  There is very little that they can accomplish, if the people are all the same.  Alas, that is never the case.  There are 2 classes of people, as well.  The rich and the poor.  Do not kid yourself, if you cannot literally get away with murder, you are poor.  If you can (and you know if you can or not) then you are rich.  

The wealthy are the merchant class of old.

While the law says all are equal under the law the merchant class and the nobility are, for the most part, above the law.  They can lie, steal, cheat and murder on gargantuan scales and get away with it.  Steal billions of dollars and pay millions in fines. 

The wealthy ask the nobility to create laws that directly benefit them and harm the poor (the little people) and the great thing is, we allow it.

We continue to elect the same idiots to their positions of nobility, reinforcing their terrible and unethical (if not criminal behavior).  We take some strange sense of comfort in this idea of the good of a political party (a team) and blame all the problems that effect us on the damage the other team has caused, without realizing that if you switched put them all in a dark room you could not tell them apart and that is has been them against us for a long time.

The hilarity of the whole thing is we could fix it very, very quickly if we wanted to.

That is where we are today.  What I see happening is the finalization of the creation of the class (or caste) system here in the US.

1.  The military will become a social class.  Currently the military is viewed as an alternative to college and in many cases an alternative to minimum wage.  I have great respect for anyone who chooses to serve, I appreciate the sacrifice, but we do not treat our soldiers well at home (or abroad - but that is a different discussion.)  The military and the greater military complex, will begin (and already has begun) to tighten restrictions on who can enter.  In the coming years, as the job of the military is reduced through automation (like the drones) the need for ""grunts"" will lessen and the military will become far, far more selective about who they accept.  It will be something that you have to work for.  Retention in the military will increase, it will be less and less common to see soldiers enter for a single hitch, rather the career military will begin to fill the ranks.  

At that point we are done.

Once the military becomes a life long career for a large percentage of people who enter, and it becomes something as hard to get in to as an Ivy League school, we are done.  The military, at that point, becomes your home and the leaders of it have complete control.  That also means that they have the ability to order you to attack the people without worrying about huge refusal and desertion (as they would today.)

At the same time as the government is working towards this goal they have another issue, you cannot make the people into serfs while they are armed.  So the government must remove guns from the hands of the people.

With a military class to enforce the rule of the government and a people deprived of their 2nd amendment right to bear arms there will be no stopping the removal of the rest of the constitution.  Since there would be no remediation on the part of the people it will be easy to remove it - we have no teeth.

The fix is actually simple.

Never, ever, again, reelect anyone.  Feel free to let them climb, but never elect the same person twice.  Always force the election of an incumbent.

Never, ever again, elect someone from the Republican or Democratic parties.  The parties only give you the faces THEY want to see elected.  They have been vetted and it is assured that they will follow the party line, at least enough to not break the system.

Start by electing the black horse.  Elect the person with no experience.  Every damn time.  If we can replace 3/4 of those up for election in the next election with Libertarians it will throw enough crap in the mix that both parties would be filibustered.  In 6 years the entirety of Congress and the White House will have been replaced.  6 years - like the length of a TV series.

At the same time, get involved locally.  Run for office, or support someone you can vouch for locally.  A peer.  Elect them.  Watch them.  If they are a good, decent person, then elect them to a higher and higher office.  Find people who share your goals and put them in office.

These are my goals / ideas  / thoughts:

1.  Freedom of the press is not free.  It is a responsibility.  The press is only a person or organization that reports truth and hard fact about corporations and government.  The news is boring.  The news is shocking (and requires some attention on our part).  The news is NOT sensational.  Unless someone in Hollywood is killed, killing someone or on trial it is NOT news.  The freedom of the Press was placed in the Constitution so that members of the Press would have protection from being silenced by the government.

I suggest the following:
1.  All press organizations receive a subsidy from the US government.
2.  All press organizations are REQUIRED by law to be independant corporations held in the public trust for the purpose of reporting news.
3.  Any television, radio or cable station that accepts money for advertising MUST donate 1.5 hours of programming a day to news reporting.  The times are as follows: 6:30 AM local time, 7:00 pm local time and 10:00pm local time.  You are welcome to create a channel that does not allow for news broadcasting, however you must either not allow for advertising (other than self promotion) or your broadcast cannot utilize any government or publicly owned resources, or subsidized resources.  You cannot utilize a single easement, land grant, eminent domain or public airwave (a public airwave in this case is anything regulated by the FCC.)

This should prevent the news media by being influenced by corporate needs, which happens now.

4.  The federal government clarifies it's stance on the 2nd amendment though federal statute.
    a.  The right to bear arms is inherent in all citizens of the US.
    b.  Anyone who can pass a criminal background check and pass the training requirement can own and legally carry a concealed weapon.
    c.  Laws for carry and transportation of firearms are set on the federal level, no state may enact more strict firearms laws.  They are confusing and ineffective.
    d.  The federal government and state governments are not in the business of criminalizing the people.  Thus, you are assumed not to be a criminal unless found to be one.  Until this point you have full rights to bear arms.
    e.  The federal government begins the subsidy of local firearms training organizations and the advertising to undo the last 50 years of lies and half truths about firearms and their place in society.  Anyone who wants to learn how to use a firearm is able to.

5.  The right of the people to education is sacrosanct.  All citizens of the United States have a right to education.  An educated people are a productive people.  An educated people are an inventive people.  We need to return to the position of being the world leaders in innovation.  We need to get some pride back.

6.  The corporation is hereby disbanded.  Immediately all corporations are converted to limited partnerships and ownership is split according to current stock ownership.  This may destroy the world economy and the dollar - at the very least.  I do not see a way around it, nor around this step.  People must become liable for their actions, even as owners of companies.

7.  The minimum wage is set to no less than 1% of your highest paid employee (all benefits included in this equation) or 1.5 x the federal poverty level, whichever is greater.  Feel free to pay your CEO 30 million, but the mail clerk will earn 300,000.  I do not have a better solution for reigning in the insane gulf between the rich and poor, but am open to suggestion.

8.  All laws of the people apply equally to all.  All criminal attourneys are required to work 30% pro-bono or donate 40% of their income to legal aid organizations.  The rich get away with it because most of the attourneys for the poor are shit.  There are exceptions, but they are rare.

9.  Basic Health Care is a right.  Standardized and reasonable heath care costs are a priority.  All health care companies are now subject to oversight from the federal government.  100% of emergency room care is now free.  All health care organizations are required to donate a certain percentage of their profits (this includes drug and medical equipment companies as well) to urgent care facilities and free clinics.  They must be able to justify the cost of medical care.  ALL medical care is declared in the public interest and only allowed to be non-profit.  Profiting off the death and injury of others is criminal.

9a - Mental care facilities are to be setup and funded by the ""state"".  Mental health is as much a priority and right as physical health. Proper care will probably be a major contributor to a reduction in crime and violence as anything else we could ever do.


10.  Prisons are to be managed by the state and federal government.  If the costs are too high then it is charged to the government to find a solution.  I suggest working on breaking the cycle of repeat offenders.

11.  Drug use is a health problem, not a legal problem.  Starting with Marijuana, recreational drugs are to be legalized, regulated and taxed.  It should be no harder to get cocaine than Vicodin.


For now that sums it up for me.  I realize there are a ton of other areas that I have missed.

TL;DR - we are fucked as a people.  Move to Canada.


EDIT- thank you all for the comments. Some notes since the replies seem to be focused on some very good points.


1.  Let me start with: I realize that much of what I suggested is socialist.  I do not have really good answers so I will try to explain my thoughts.

2.  Lawyers - this one is tough.  Often your ability to mount a defense is based on money. No ALWAYS it is based on money.  Good attorneys are expensive. Bad attorneys are cheap. District attorneys love bad criminal defense lawyers since they are easy to beat. They do not have the staff or the budget to fight for their client adequately. Public defenders have no budget and have too many cases. I am not trying to subject anyone to the rule of government, but justice needs some help. A worthy defense should not be restricted to the wealthy.

3.  Health Care - we already have dozens of social programs for health care.  Emergency room services are already subsidized. They are required to provide service, but not at a cost that is reasonable for the services provided.  Have you been to the doctor lately?  Something has to be done.  A one hour service that can prevent cancer can cost the patient $10,000. Good luck getting a quote. Insurance is terrible.  Go to the ER, get an MRI, have a doctor take a look and prescribe some medication - there goes $3900.00. And it may not work at all.  How is that reasonable cost for service?  The free market has driven an essential cost higher for us than any other nation per capita.  Why?  Again, what is the solution? Should quality medical care not be something that everyone deserves access to? Or should you be indebted forever because some drunk drive runs you down and leaves the scene?

4.  I completely forgot any commentary on illegal aliens. I do not support illegal aliens receiving any benefit from living here. I am not opposed to providing a path to legalized citizenship, but they should not be able to achieve citizenship from giving birth here, should not receive benefits of any kind. I have a friend who works for ice and he is constantly amazed at the number of illegal aliens who are felons AND living on welfare with government medical!  Even when he has a note added to their file to not reissue their benefits when they are arrested again they are found to be enjoying the same benefits.  Unacceptable.

5.  I also did not comment on welfare.  If you are on the dole you should work.  There is plenty to be done, welfare should not be a free ride.  Please note: I am not attacking unemployment or disability, just welfare.

I will add more later, have to go now.

I would really enjoy hearing other solutions....

Political scientist here. I want to emphasize something to members of this sub. The NRA and other progun groups currently hold the advantage in the gun debate - the NRA has a high approval rating, gun laws are loose in most states, and the NRA and state affiliates are very well organized and good at stopping bad laws. The NRA has several hundred million dollars to throw around and can raise more if needed.

By themselves, the VPC, Brady crew, and Bloomberg's Mayor's Against Illegal (read: all) Guns can't force any new legislation. But that all changed, in my view, when Obama said he would put [""everything I've got""](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/17/us/politics/obama-to-ask-congress-to-toughen-gun-laws.html?_r=0) into passing new gun control laws, including an AWB. I originally (stupidly) didn't think Obama would push hard for a new AWB. But if we take him at his word, he is going to.

Obama for America is was the president's election and re-election campaign. It is widely recognized to be one of the most effective political organizations in the nation. It has a ground operation in dozens and dozens of states. It spend a billion (with a B) dollars to defeat Mitt Romney in 2012. And it didn't just fade away after the 2012. [It is currently gearing up to push for new gun laws by pressuring Congress](http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2013/01/obamas-campaign-turns-to-gun-control/). 

&gt;“The president has the most exciting campaign apparatus ever built. It’s time to turn that loose,” senior Obama adviser Robert Gibbs told MSNBC on Wednesday.

From a political science perspective, Gibbs is right. Obama for America is one of the most effective political organizations in American history. And they don't even have to convince the American people anymore (they're [for an assault weapons ban](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/18/us/poll-shows-school-shooting-sways-views-on-guns.html), though barely), they just have to convince a [few dozen congressmen](http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/2012/results/house) and senators.

If you think the NRA can stop them without you doing anything, you are dead wrong. The White House has an action plan in place and they are moving to deploy it. From the [NYT](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/17/us/politics/obama-to-ask-congress-to-toughen-gun-laws.html?_r=0):

&gt;The White House is planning a multifaceted effort to sell its plans, including speeches around the country by the president and vice president and concerted lobbying by interest groups to influence several dozen lawmakers from both parties seen as critical to passage.

And they're not alone. Bloomberg, the media, and the Brady Campaign are going to help them:

&gt;Mark Glaze, director of Mayors Against Illegal Guns, said his group would focus on as many as 25 Congressional districts, including those of Democrats and Republicans. “We will be doing what we can do to make sure that sitting on their hands is the least safe place to be,” he said.

MAIG has millions upon millions of dollars. Combined with the money and huge ground game of OfA and the misleading research of the Brady Campaign and VPC, they are a force to be reckoned with. They will push an AWB, mag caps, and expanded background checks. Do not believe for a second that the NRA alone can stop them. America is becoming more and more suburban and fewer suburbanites own guns than ever before. At the same time, many swing Congressional districts are becoming primarily suburban. If the anti-gunners effectively target these few congressmen, they **will** pass an AWB.

Especially if you live in one of America's swing states or a [swing congressional district](http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/2012/results/house), contact your congressman and Senators right now. Even if they're a Republican! Republicans won't fight for your rights if they think it's a losing issue.

**TLDR: Obama is using his old campaign apparatus to push for an Assault Weapons Ban and it will be highly effective. Don't be complacent for a moment thinking the NRA can stand alone on this and win. [Contact Congress now](http://www.congress.org/congressorg/directory/congdir.tt) and donate whatever you can to the [NRA](http://membership.nrahq.org/), [SAF](http://www.saf.org/default.asp?p=safdonation), or any other gun rights group you prefer.**

Arguing for the right to own these magazines is something that can be problematic, as even many gun owners see no issue with restricting access to them.

Furthermore, I've seen a lot of pro-gun folks try to make a case for these magazines, and come off as either insensitive, buffoonish, or just downright stupid, and it makes me cringe every time I watch it happen.

So, in the interest of preserving our second amendment rights, here are my thoughts on arguing against bans on &gt;10 round magazines.

**Know Who You're Debating**

Most of the people reacting to Sandy Hook (and other rampage shootings) are not gun people. For the most part, they aren't anti-gun people, either. They are, however, completely ignorant about guns and how they work, and have a general level of fear associated with guns and people who own them.

What they're looking for is an answer to the question of ""how do we stop rampage shootings"" and they're grabbing at the first straw, gun control, that seems like a good idea. You have to convince them that gun control is not the answer.

**Arguments That Don't Work, and Why**

*• It's my right to own them because 2nd Amendment.*
-This argument is true, however it makes you look stupid and selfish. After all, to the people you're speaking to, you come off sounding like you put your right to own a dangerous product above the safety of their kids.

*•I own them because I can.*
-Again, this is a stupidly weak argument, and a tautology on top.

*•I own them because I may need them for self-defense.*
-Remember, the people you're talking to have not spent any time at all studying personal defense, much less defense with a firearm. By and large, most people assume that a more traditional style of gun, like a revolver, would be perfectly adequate. Furthermore, statistically speaking, for the vast, vast majority of defensive encounters, they're right. The number of self-defense incidents where capacity of the defender's gun was what won the day are, in truth,  vanishingly small. As a result, most people, who've spent no time reading up on the current state of self-defense will dismiss you as a paranoid lunatic with delusions of having to fend off an army.

*•I own them because we may need them in case of invasion/the US government turns on its own people/The Revolution/Wolverines!*
-Most people in this country live comfortable lives, and they rarely pay attention to historical precedent. As a result, they don't believe that things could come down to a situation where things go all Warsaw Ghetto, and even if they *do* entertain the notion that such a thing could happen here, they cannot and will not consider the idea of actually picking up a gun and fighting against an existential threat. Any argument that follows the revolutionary line of reasoning will be dismissed out of hand as paranoid fantasizing. You will be painted as a lunatic preparing for an event that will never happen. The assumption is that you're so delusional that you are putting your right to a revolution that will never come up against the protection of children.

*•I own them because it makes it easier for me at the shooting range or because having them reduces amount of time I have to waste loading magazines.*
-Again, this argument makes you look completely unsympathetic. After all, if a ban on magazines would reduce these shootings, then who cares if it means you're slightly inconvenienced during a range trip?

*•I own them because I compete in USPSA/3 Gun/some other form of competition.*
-This argument can help to counter the ""you don't need a high capacity magazine to hunt"" or ""why would anyone have these things?"" and pointing out that you're involved in a competitive sport may confer some legitimacy, but it's still a weak argument, because you sound like you're putting the enjoyment of a game above the safety of kids.

**Arguments That Should Work, With Explanation**

The best way to voice your opposition to a magazine ban isn't by asserting your rights. Regardless of how strongly you feel about the 2nd Amendment, rights-based or possession-based arguments are not going to sway someone who is on the fence about the 2nd Amendment, and/or already believes that no reasonable person owns such an item.

The best way to make the case in favor of &gt;10 round magazines is from a policy perspective. As gun owners we should all be actively engaging in the public discussion over these items, and offering our unique knowledge to help guide policy in a direction that will actually be effective at stopping these sorts of shootings from happening in the future.

***The best arguments against a ban on these magazines is to point out that such a ban SIMPLY WILL NOT WORK.*** It's thoroughly terrible policy that will absolutely not stop the next rampage killer from taking out as many victims as his tortured mental state demands.

Here's a breakdown of the arguments that are bound to be the most effective, at least with people who aren't being completely emotional about the situation.

*•The 1994-2004 Assault Weapon Ban*
-The US had a ban on these magazines that lasted for ten years, and during that time, there was not one trustworthy study that showed the ban had any effect whatsoever on rates of violent crime, regardless of the type.

*•The technology is already ""in the wild.""*
-With the exception of the ten years during the federal assault weapon ban &gt;10 round magazines have been sold with hundreds of millions of new guns, and available on the market to anyone who cares to purchase them. These magazines are mechanically simple (about as complex as a well-constructed travel mug), small, and completely untraceable. Any attempt to regulate these magazines will essentially be DOA because there are already so many of them in private hands.

*•Consider the implications of enforcing a ban*
-Everyone wants to get behind the idea of a ban without putting any thought into actual enforcement costs. Ask them to explain how they would enforce a ban.
Would they be willing to ok warrantless searches to find these magazines?
Would they be willing to arrest, try, convict, and imprison for ten years anyone found to possess one?
How much would it cost to imprison all of these millions of people?
Would we have to construct new prisons for them?
Would it really be worth it?

(The nice thing about this line of reasoning is that it's an extremely easy litmus test to see if you're dealing with someone who's halfway rational or not. No rational person would actually agree that locking up tens of millions of people who've harmed no one would be a good idea. And if the person says they're ok with it, you know they're a nut. This argument also has the potential to work well if you're talking to people in favor of legalizing pot, as the comparisons between marijuana users and magazine owners are actually pretty clear-cut.)

*•How to enforce a ban?*
-How would you keep people from importing unmarked magazines from outside of the US, or squirting them out of a 3D printer?

*•Point out that other mass shootings have taken place without &gt;10 round magazines*
-3 of the 4 guns used by the Columbine shooters did not use high capacity magazines. Specifically, Eric Harris had to reload his Hi-Point Carbine ten times, and the double-barreled shotgun used was reloaded over twenty times. [Source]http://acolumbinesite.com/weapon.html The Walther used by Seung-Hui Cho could not hold more than ten rounds. The Beltway ""snipers"" never fired more than one shot at any given murder attempt. Charles Whitman used no high capacity magazines.

-Changing magazines is an action that even an amateur can easily complete in under four seconds. Even if the killer is limited to ten round magazines, it won't matter. They will simply carry more magazines and reload more often. Furthermore, there is not one instance where that extra reload time made a difference in the outcome of a shooting. (Some may try to claim that it did in the case of the Giffords shooting, but Loughner's gun jammed, which is what provided the time to others around him to react.)


Finally, if you're a parent and a gun owner, voice this fact. Having a kid means you've got skin in the game, and gives you additional legitimacy. Remember, at the end of the day, everyone wants the same thing: to stop or reduce the number of rampage killings, especially those targeting children. As gun owners, we have not only a unique perspective and specialist knowledge on the subject, but we've also got the most to lose. Therefore it is extremely important for all of us to present the best arguments we can.

I hope that this post is useful. I've been making a number of these arguments on public news forums with some success. I'd appreciate any feedback.

This, after both Barack Obama and Eric Holder have called for a re-examination of these laws in the wake of the Zimmerman incident.

The problem is that Stand Your Ground laws had nothing to do with the Zimmerman case.  (Explanation in a post below)

---

To those of us who understand the law and the Zimmerman case, Mr. Holder, Mr. Obama, and Mr. Durbin are clearly and unambiguously exploiting public fervor over this situation in order to attempt to limit self-defense law across the country.

**We must respond.**

**I.  Call your federal and state senators and representatives and urge them to SUPPORT stand your ground laws.**

The call should be brief and to the point.  You're talking to an intern who is just writing down your position.  ""Please encourage Senator/Representative X to oppose any attempt to repeal or change Stand Your Ground legislation.  Stand your ground laws are GOOD laws, and have nothing to do with the Zimmerman case.""

If your state doesn't have SYG laws, ask your legislator to introduce them!

[Find your representatives here](http://www.usa.gov/Contact/Elected.shtml).

You can also use the GOA tool to send them an e-mail about this, but *please* call as well.  They need to hear our voices.  [E-mail link.](http://capwiz.com/gunowners/home/)

**II.  Get your friends and loved ones involved.**  If they're like minded, get them to call like you did.  Get your husbands, wives, sons, daughters, brothers, and sisters calling.  Let them know how important this is to you.  If they're not like minded yet, take them shooting.  Educate everyone you can.  The senators need to hear from as many *different* voices as possible.  

**III.  Call representatives who are on the fence, under pressure, or calling for change about SYG laws.**

[Dick Durbin's Contact Information](http://www.durbin.senate.gov/public/).  (Durbin is calling for SYG hearings).   (202) 224-2152

[Bob Goodlatte](http://goodlatte.house.gov/contacts/new) is under pressure to have similar hearings in the house.  He is pro-gun, but needs to know he has our support.  **(202) 225-5431**

[John McCain](http://www.mccain.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=Contact.OfficeLocations) has called for review of SYG laws.  **(202) 224-2235**

[Shelia Jackson-Lee](http://jacksonlee.house.gov/contact/officeinformation.htm) will be introducing [legislation](http://dailycaller.com/2013/07/24/dem-congresswoman-introduces-bill-to-cut-funds-to-stand-your-ground-states/) to force states to switch SYG language to duty to retreat language or risk losing federal funding.  **(202) 225-3816**

**IV.  Educate as many people as you can about SYG laws.**  This is fairly straightforward; people who oppose SYG laws generally don't know what SYG is.  Use the resources linked above to inform them, and attempts to mislead on the topic by those opposed to SYG laws will be immediately transparent.  Link to [this SYG explanation](http://www.husseinandwebber.com/stand_your_ground.html) on Facebook and explain how Zimmerman's case does not relate to SYG.

Thanks for reading.

**EDIT**:  Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee will introduce the [Justice Exists for All](http://gopthedailydose.com/2013/07/24/democrat-sheila-jackson-lee-filing-bill-to-cut-funding-to-any-state-that-doesnt-change-stand-your-ground-laws-to-duty-to-retreat/) bill, which will seek to cut federal funding to states that don't change SYG laws to Duty to Retreat laws.  **CALL YOUR REPS DAILY**.

A large number of [gun control bills](http://onlygunsandmoney.blogspot.com/2013/01/lots-of-bills-filed-in-congress.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+NoLawyers-OnlyGunsAndMoney+%28No+Lawyers+-+Only+Guns+and+Money%29) were introduced last week, all in the house of representatives, and all were referred to the [judiciary committee](http://judiciary.house.gov/about/members.html).

The incoming chair, [Bob Goodlatte](http://blogs.roanoke.com/politics/2012/12/19/goodlatte-will-be-key-player-in-gun-control-debate/), is opposed to new gun control measures.

The 2012 committee was comprised of 18 Republicans and 15 Democrats.

The upshot here is, **the house judiciary committee is our best shot at shutting most of this legislation down before it starts**.

In addition to calling your own representatives this week, here are the numbers for the members of the Judiciary committee.  As the 113th congress committee hasn't been formed yet, this list is subject to change, but generally most of them stick around from year to year.  Call as many as you can each day.  All is better than some, some is better than one, one is better than none.  Most of their officers open either at 8:30 EST or 9:00 EST.

Remember, no need to deliver a lengthy speech.  It's an intern on the other end of the line, marking tallies on a pad.  Just ring the phones and say something like, ""Please encourage the representative to say **no** to new gun control measures.  We need to shut these bills down in committee.""

If they ask for your zip code and you're not local, consider saying, ""I'm calling with respect to Representative [X]'s role on the Judiciary committee, where s/he is making decisions that affect every American.""  Then give them your zip code if you want.

Pro-gun reps need the call so they have big numbers to point to when they argue in our favor. Anti-gun reps need the call so they'll feel weak and be less likely to push the issue.

I get no karma for this post.

**EDIT**: Getting [some information](http://thehill.com/blogs/hillicon-valley/technology/266575-house-judiciary-committee-roster-to-undergo-changes) about possible committee roster changes.

**EDIT 2**:  I asked as many interns as I could if they were returning as I went through the call list.  Updated the list with the results.  For the last three (Sanchez, Waters, Watt), I was getting loopy and forgot to write down whether they're coming back, so if someone could ask and post in this thread, I'd appreciate it.

First to show support of politicians who follow up their words with actions. Second to thank her for keeping the main goal of keeping our society safe a priority. And third to show that we are on the same side, no one wants to see people murdered by any means, we do differ however in the methodology. This has been made simply to show that legislation meant to ban ""Assault Weapons"", which by itself is a made up term with no real definition, would do nothing more than infringe on the second amendment rights of Americans, not save lives.

To begin, let us look at the legislation and realize that the fundamental argument of the entirety of this document is that these assault weapon bans work. nothing more has been provided to the justification of this legislation.

The first document provided to justify this was the Urban institute study for the department of justice. This study was cited because it showed that the Assault Weapons Ban of 1994 was the cause of the drop in gun murders. However what this study ignores is that gun homicide was already on the decrease and even after the ban was lifted gun homicide still went down. this study used a correlation based proof which is a *post hoc ergo proctor hoc* logical fallacy. Therefore this study can be set aside as being based on a fallacy.

The second study, by the University of Pennsylvania, raw data shows that the use of an ""Assault Weapon"" in a crime decreased by over 66% in 9 years. However this study fails to mention that guns that fall into this poorly defined class of firearms are nationally &lt;1.5% of all gun related crime. This means that their reduction by 66% over nine years, which is 7.3% per years, is actually less than 0.11% of all gun related crime a year. Essentially all this study does is take the equivalent of a change of 1 out of a 1000 per year, and manipulate the numbers to falsify the significance. On top of that, after the 1994 ban was lifted the use of an assault weapon in crime still decreased, showing that this study is not only manipulative, but also falls into the logical fallacy mentioned above.

The third study in a Washington Post story, showed that possession of high capacity magazines decreased while they were illegal. This means nothing, because all it shows is that those who were victim to this Virginia law are law abiding citizens by following the law regardless of their agreement with it. This has nothing to do with the effectiveness of any Ban on any crime and therefore is a *non-unique* fallacy.

The next piece of evidence is a letter to the editor, which i wont go into detail about because its a *post hoc ergo propter hoc* fallacy again.

And then we hace a study by the Violence Policy Center, which shows that from 2005 to 2007 1 out of 4 police officers KIA were killed with an assault weapon. However this has no impact on the case. Despite being an interesting statistic they do not show that a ban would reduce this, meaning this is nothing more than just that. an interesting statistic.

The last study by the Police Executive Research Forum found that 37% of police departments reported a noticeable increase in the use of assault weapons by criminals. However this study has several issues. First that it does not show how many showed a decrease, which considering it could be from 0% to 63% means this statistic could go in either direction. on top of that it does not distinguish between areas of high and low population. So if highly populated areas saw a decrease, they would be equally counted as a low populated area even though the net result is a decrease.

On top of the fact that **none** of the studies showed to justify a ban are either incomplete, a fallacy, and/or purposefully misleading, other studies have shown the opposite.

First the study by The University of Tennessee at Chattanooga, “The Effectiveness of Gun-Control Laws: A Statistical Analysis” by Patrick D. Blake. This study took the raw data, and corrected for independent variables, like race and wealth to avoid the *post hoc [...]* fallacy seen in the studies mentioned above, and found that when the data is properly analyzed, not only has gun legislation shown to in no way prevent crime but that other than the instant background check, gun control laws like the ban **increase** gun related crime. That is to say, laws like the Assault Weapons Ban kills our citizens by disarming them, and making them weak.

This is better illustrated by the study by the Valparaiso University Law Review, “Does Allowing Law-Abiding Citizens to Carry Concealed Handguns Save Lives” by John R. Lott Jr. which actually took the statistical analysis (again avoiding the simple fallacies of the flawed studies of those in favor og un control) and actually gave us the number of innocent people whose lives were lost because of gun control. The people that could not defend themselves.

&gt;""The most conservative estimates show that adopting these so-called ”shall issue” or nondiscretionary permit laws reduced murders by
8%, rapes by 5%, aggravated assaults by 7%, and robbery by 3%. To
put it another way, if those states which did not have concealed handgun laws in 1992 had adopted them, citizens in those states would have avoided suffering approximately 1500 murders, 4200 rapes, over 60,000 aggravated assaults, and 12,000 robberies. Criminals do apparently respond to deterrence.""",,False,,t5_2vtr4,False,,,True,t3_15iixo,http://www.reddit.com/r/progun/comments/15iixo/the_opposition_to_the_assault_weapon_ban_of_2013/,

It's time to go on the offensive. Contact legislators and express your desire for constitutional carry. For states like Texas, win back open carry.
