Let's do this guys!

Someone mentioned a Ryder cup format and a city vs city. I think if we could find similar courses in each city and everyone play on the same day that could work. 

Also if there is enough participation just in the ATL area we might be able to have our own so let's find out. All in favor of a city vs city chime in with your opinions! 

Also my ATL friends let's see how many we can get together!


EDIT: If we can get 4 people from each city a 4 man scramble could be in order

**********THIS LIST IS NOT ACCURATE, IT IS NOT UP TO DATE. I AM WORKING ON GETTING TEAMS TOGETHER AND WORKING WITH TEAM CAPTAINS TO UPDATE THIS LIST. IF YOU DO NOT SEE YOUR NAME ON THIS LIST DO NOT FREAK OUT. THE OFFICIAL TEAMS WILL BE POSTED TOMORROW MORNING. ************

EDIT 3: Since this is getting so much attention I think we should elect a ""team leader"" for each city's team and they would manage the course choice, team members, posting scores etc. Anyone down?

EDIT 4: Everyone thank /u/ewhitten for helping with the scoring and formatting!

EDIT 5: TEAM CAPTAINS!!!! Captains from each city, read through the post and find any stragglers that I might have missed and get your team together. Collect any info you can (handicap, age, name) and start looking for a course near you guys. Then PM me all the info and I will make an Excel spreadsheet tonight and start working on the logistics. /u/tuckermans suggested that we pick the courses from myscorecard.com to ensure we are all playing on courses similar in difficulty.

EDIT 6: Sorry if your team isn't up there yet, I am slammed with PM's and comments. I WILL read all PM's and try to get back in a timely manner. Expect something more concrete tonight if all Team Captains get back to me sometime soon. I will also be making an Excel spreadsheet with names and info. Check back tomorrow for sure. 

EDIT 7: OKAY! Team Captains get your info in to me by 8 PM tonight and I will put together a spreadsheet! I need NAME, HANDICAP, CITY, possible courses and dates. 

EDIT 8: If you are a team captain for your city go through the post and scoop up and players you might have missed, we want to get EVERYONE the chance to play. That being said if you do not know if your city has a team captain take charge and be the team captain!",,False,,t5_2qhcs,1374609719.0,,titleist,True,t3_1ivmtw,http://www.reddit.com/r/golf/comments/1ivmtw/reddit_golf_tournament_upvote_for_visibility/,

* Never try to keep more than 300 separate thoughts in your mind during 
 your swing.

* When your shot has to carry over a water hazard, you can either use 
 one more club or two more balls.

* If you're afraid a full shot might reach the green while the foursome 
 ahead of you is still putting out, you have two options: you can 
 immediately shank a lay-up or you can wait until the green is clear 
 and top a ball halfway there.

* The less skilled the player, the more likely he is to share his ideas 
 about the golf swing.

* No matter how bad you are playing, it is always possible to play worse.

* The inevitable result of any golf lesson is the instant elimination 
 of the one critical unconscious motion that allowed you to compensate 
 for all of your many other errors.

* Everyone replaces his divot after a perfect approach shot.

* A golf match is a test of your skill against your opponent' s luck.

* It is surprisingly easy to hole a 30 foot putt - for a 10.

* Counting on your opponent to inform you when he breaks a rule is like 
 expecting him to make fun of his own haircut.

* Nonchalant putts count the same as chalant putts.

* It's not a gimme if you're still away.

* The shortest distance between any two points on a golf course is a 
 straight line that passes directly through the center of a very large tree.

* You can hit a two acre fairway 10% of the time and a two inch branch 
 90% of the time.

* If you really want to get better at golf, go back and take it up at a  
 much earlier age.

* Since bad shots come in groups of three, a fourth bad shot is 
 actually the beginning of the next group of three.

* When you look up, causing an awful shot, you will always look down 
 again at exactly the moment when you ought to start watching the ball 
 if you ever want to see it again.

* Every time a golfer makes a birdie, he must subsequently make two 
 double bogeys to restore the fundamental equilibrium of the universe.

* To calculate the speed of a player's downswing, multiply the speed of 
 his back swing by his handicap; i.e., back-swing 20 mph, handicap 15, 
 downswing = 300 mph.

* There are two things you can learn by stopping your back swing at the 
 top and checking the position of your hands: how many hands you have, 
 and which one is wearing the glove.

* Hazards attract; fairways repel.

* A ball you can see in the rough from 50 yards away is not yours.

* If there is a ball on the fringe and a ball in the bunker, your ball 
 is in the bunker. If both balls are in the bunker, yours is in the footprint

* It's easier to get up at 6:00 AM to play golf than at 10:00 AM to mow 
 the grass.

* A good drive on the 18th hole has stopped many a golfer from giving 
 up the game.

* Golf is the perfect thing to do on Sunday because you spend longer 
 praying than you would do in church.

* A good golf partner is one who's always slightly worse than you are, 
 that's why I get so many calls to play with friends.

* If there's a storm rolling in, you'll be having the game of your life. 

* Golf balls are like eggs. They're white. They're sold by the dozen 
 and you need to buy fresh ones each week.

* It's amazing how a golfer who never helps out around the house will 
 replace his divots, repair his ball marks, and rake his sand traps.

* If your opponent has trouble remembering whether he shot a six or a 
 seven, he probably shot an eight (or worse)...

* It takes longer to learn to be a good golfer than it does to become a 
 brain surgeon. On the other hand, you don't get to ride around on a 
 cart, drink beer, and eat hot dogs when you are performing brain surgery!

Tonight, I thought my husband was acting weird. We had made plans to meet at
a nice restaurant for dinner. I was shopping with my friends all day long,
so I thought he was upset at the fact that I was a bit late, but he made no
comment on it. Conversation wasn't flowing, so I suggested that we go
somewhere quiet so we could talk. He agreed, but he didn't say much.

I asked him what was wrong; He said, 'Nothing..' I asked him if it was my
fault that he was upset He said he wasn't upset, that it had nothing to do
with me, and not to worry about it. On the way home, I told him that I loved
him. He smiled slightly, and kept driving. I can't explain his behavior. I
don't know why he didn't say, 'I love you, too.'

When we got home, I felt as if I had lost him completely, as if he wanted
nothing to do with me anymore. He just sat there quietly, and watched TV.
He continued to seem distant and absent. Finally, with silence all around
us, I decided to go to bed. About 15 minutes later, he came to bed. But I
still felt that he was distracted, and his thoughts were somewhere else. He
fell asleep; I cried. I don't know what to do. I'm almost sure that his
thoughts are with someone else. My life is a disaster.

I tee up, pick the driver, and aim to the left for the inevitable slice. But not too much just incase i might actually hit it straight. I swing, hit, and the ball soars beautifully with just a slight fade, landing somewhere over the ridge that's on the fairway. 

I find the ball, 270-280 yards from the tee, in the middle of the fairway. A perfect drive. 
Ecstatic, i pull out a sandwedge for a smooth 100 yard approach, with the flag just sitting there in the middle of the green. Nothing in my way but fairway. I swing, shank the ball far left out of bounds in some bushes. Stunned, i stand there, just looking at that easy par slipping away. I take out another ball and drop it where i hit the shank. I top this one, over the green, stopping in the high rough. I chip, and then two putt. Triple Bogey.

He left home around 8:30 to play golf with his friends. On the way out the door, he answered his wife’s “What time will you be home?” question with “Probably around 1:30 – I’ll have lunch at the club.” 
1:30 came and went, 3:00 passed, 6:15, still not home, finally at about 7:00 PM he rolls in the driveway, leaves his clubs in the garage, and presents his wife with a pizza, and begins the apologetic story. ""We finished our game about 11:30, had lunch and I started home, when alongside the road I saw this attractive girl with a flat tire on her car. I stopped to help, got the tire changed, and looked around for a place to wash my hands. She offered money, but I refused, so she suggested that I at least allow her to buy me a beer. She said there's a tavern just up the road, and they have a restroom, you can clean up a bit. I agreed to stop, we had a beer, then another beer, then a couple more, and I realized that this girl was not only pretty, she was very friendly, and a good companion to spend time with. Before I knew it, we were in the motel next door having sex. And that is why I am so late getting home.""

Ok so you’re interested in playing golf or you want to know how to improve? That’s awesome. Golf is a very rewarding game. For many of us, it doesn’t get better than spending a sunny day with friends out on the course. Plus, there’s usually beer.

This guide is going to cover almost all of the information you’re going to need to effectively get up and running with golf while avoiding a lot of common mistakes.

###Basics

* **[Golf terminology.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_golf)** There's lots of lingo you'll need to learn.

* **Rules of Golf.** There are a lot of [rules in golf](http://www.usga.org/rules.aspx?id=7788), many that are not so obvious. Unless you’re in a tournament or playing for money, most of them aren’t terribly important IMO. I play to have fun, but YMMV. You will want to read up on what to do with lost balls though. Check out [these threads](http://www.reddit.com/r/golf/search?q=rules&amp;restrict_sr=on) for more on rules.

* **What to Wear.** Most courses require collared shirts (polos) for men, but have eased up that requirement for women. Shorts, pants, or a skirt are just fine. I’d recommend a hat, sunglasses, and sun-tan lotion as well.

###Golf Etiquette

There are a number of faux pas that you can commit on the golf course, so be sure to read this [full list]( http://www.usga.org/etiquette/tips/golf-etiquette-101/) before going out. Some common mistakes include:

* **Not repairing your pitch marks.** When the ball lands on the green, it can sometimes leave an in indent which will screw up putts. If you don’t repair it properly, you can destroy the root. Watch [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1UWnpv3woU) to learn how to repair your pitch marks. Also fix your divots and rake sand traps.

* **Not keeping up with the pace of play.** Be ready to take your shot when it’s your turn.

* **Talking while people are taking their shot.** Or talking loud enough that people putting or teeing off on other holes can hear you. Just be considerate.

* **Not picking up your tees.** If it’s not broken, you can reuse it. If it is broken, just toss it in the garbage. There is some debate in the comments as to whether this is necessary.

* **Giving unsolicited advice.** I almost never give advice on the course unless I’m with a friend who I know would appreciate and use it. And when I do give it, it’s only for high-visibility, easily correctable mistakes, plus I’ll start by asking if they want advice. Giving people unsolicited advice is in poor form and you might even hurt their game by making them think too much which can throw off their swing.

* **Hitting your ball near other people.** If they could be in range, just wait. If you accidentally hit it near them, yell “Fore!” or something to warn them.

* **Not letting people play through.** If your group is slower and the group behind you has to wait a lot for you  to finish, let them play the next hole first.

* **Parking the golf cart or pull cart on the green.** Greens are super sensitive and very expensive to repair so don’t risk damaging them.

* **Walking or casting a shadow on people’s putting lines.** Putting is hard enough as it is without other players distracting you.

* **Standing too close to a player swinging his club.** Some people apparently need to learn this lesson the hard way.

###Getting Golf Clubs

Starting out, your clubs will not matter very much. You’re not going to be hitting consistently and $1,000 irons are going to be completely wasted upon you. A lot of people will start golf by just using friends’ clubs or renting them from the golf course. That way you can decide if you like it enough to invest money in your own set.

If you're ready to buy, then I think your safest bet is going to be buying a used set on Craigslist or buying used clubs piecemeal. Buying a nice set of a clubs that are a few years old is a great way to get good stuff at a reasonable price. 

I think many would recommend not buying a new beginner’s set as they are not generally considered to be of the best quality, and when you improve, you’ll definitely want to upgrade. So long term, you’re spending more than you would otherwise. And buying new, really nice clubs is not going to be the best use of money at this point.

Take the money you save by buying used and invest it in golf lessons, range time, and actual golf. That will serve you much better.

###Other Golf Gear You'll Need

After you get clubs, here are some more things you’ll need:

* **Golf bag.** Getting one that stands up automatically and has backpack straps is worth it IMO.

* **Golf balls.** For a beginner, I would just use whatever is cheapest. Buying [used balls online]( http://www.lostgolfballs.com) or in the $.50 bin at your course is fine. You’re probably going to be losing a lot of balls initially, so cheaper is better IMO.

* **Tees.** I bought a bag of 500 a few years back for $10 which will last me practically forever.

* **Divot Repair Tool.** You’ll occasionally need this to repair greens when your ball makes a divot upon landing.

* **Ball marker.** You can use a coin, but at least have something small and flat to mark where your ball is on the green.

* **Two towels.** One for your clubs and balls, and one for your face. Anticipate getting sweaty.

* **Golf shoes.** Very optional. They definitely help when the grass is wet, but unless traction is an issue, you don’t really need them. When you do get them, make sure to get ones with plastic, not metal spikes as a lot of courses don’t allow metal spikes anymore.

* **Golf glove.** I don’t personally use one. They do provide extra grip if your hand gets very sweaty and protect your hand from getting calluses. Many gloves tend to wear out quickly, and since sweat and calluses aren't an issue for me, I don’t bother. If you do go for a glove, don't cheap out. It'll wear out sooner and you'll spend more money in the long run. There's also some good comments about gloves below this post.

###Approaching Golf the Right way

One of the biggest high-level problems I see is people approaching golf with unrealistic expectations. Unless you’re [Kim Il Sung]( http://www.11points.com/News-Politics/11_Craziest_Kim_Jong-Il_Moments), you’re not gonna be shooting a perfect game of golf (18 hole in ones), nor are you going to be shooting anywhere near par every hole. It’s just not gonna happen anytime soon. Even the pros regularly hit well over par and they have tens of thousands of hours into this game while you probably have close to zero. Read [this articles](http://www.golfwrx.com/82327/golfers-have-ridiculous-expectations/) to get an idea of how unrealistic many golfers' expectations are. And this is a [worthy read](http://www.reddit.com/r/golf/comments/1jtbeg/got_this_in_an_email_a_while_backpowerful_stuff/cbi47la) of an older guy who regrets not enjoying the game while he could.

I am not trying to get you down, you just need to understand two things:

* ***Golf is not a game of perfect.***

* ***You cannot win golf.***

I and many others have observed people playing golf with the idea that every shot should be perfect, and getting angry and frustrated when that doesn’t happen. I think it leads people to love/hate the game, rather than just *enjoying the process even if the end result isn’t a great score.*

###Golf Sucks at First

Golf is really not very fun when you’re whiffing 80%+ of your shots. I’m not talking about when the ball doesn’t go exactly where you want. I’m talking when you completely screw your swing up and hit the ball who-the-knows-where or when you top it and it goes 10 feet or when you just completely miss the ball. That’s just not fun.

But…it does get better. You’re just going to have to suffer through some of that, but once you start hitting that ball with a nice loft and distance…oh man. Feels good, brah. With this guide and conscious practice, I believe you’ll minimize the shitty period.

***Remember: Sucking at something is the first step to being sorta good at something.***

###Swing Basics

All right, let’s finally start talking about actually playing golf. Here are the basic first steps for establishing a swing. There are LOTS of videos on golf out there, so don’t feel like you only need to go by these:

* [The Grip.](http://www.rickardstrongert.com/video/17/The_Grip)

* [The Setup](http://www.rickardstrongert.com/video/16/Set_Up_In_Five_Steps) &amp; [Common Mistakes at Setup.]( http://www.rickardstrongert.com/video/14/Common_Mistakes_At_Set-Up)

* [How to Swing.](http://www.rickardstrongert.com/video/22/How_To_Perform_The_Perfect_Golf_Swing)

* [How to Putt.]( http://www.rickardstrongert.com/video/51/How_To_Set_Up_Your_Stance_And_Grip_For_Successful_)

* [How to Pitch.]( http://www.rickardstrongert.com/video/10/How_To_Improve_Your_Chipping_Technique)

* [How to play out of a bunker.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2Q9GEd3MkU)

From there, the sky’s the limit both when it comes to improving your swing and the resources available for doing so.

###You Should Almost Definitely Take a Lesson

Taking a lesson from a golf pro is ***highly recommended.*** Having someone show you in-person the basics makes a big difference. Expect to pay $50-100 per hour, but private lessons can go to $500+ (You don't need a lesson from Tiger to learn the basics). I think almost all golfers would agree that an initial lesson or two is well worth the money and will offer an extremely high return on investment. It’s better to pay a little now to get good habits ingrained than pay a lot later to try to fix a bad habit.

One or more of your local courses will almost assuredly offer lessons. Once you’ve got a basic swing down, you can consider having your [swing analyzed online via video](http://thegolfevolution.com/full-swing) (there are lots of online coaches, mind you) for 25-75% cheaper or even posting it to /r/golf for analysis.

###YouTube Coaches

There are **many** more out there, but these guys are pretty great:

* **[Shawn Clement.](http://www.youtube.com/user/clemshaw/videos)** Check out this good [series of his](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLB8EDFDD172E035E4&amp;feature=plcp).

* **[Mark Crossfield.](http://www.youtube.com/user/AskGolfGuru/videos)**

* **[Rickard Strongert.](http://www.rickardstrongert.com/videos)**

* **[Paul Wilson.](http://www.youtube.com/user/paulwilsongolf/videos)**

###Common Beginner Mistakes

* **Lifting your head too early.** If you’re not watching the ball, you ain’t gonna hit it. This is without a doubt, the biggest problem beginners have. Keep watching that ball until your body naturally pulls it up.

* **Straightening your legs.** If you’re topping the ball, one of the main causes is standing up all the way which will naturally raise the club head’s path.

* **Swinging too fast/hard.** Slow your swing down. Ego is the enemy in golf. I know you want to murder the ball, but your swing is not good enough to handle those speeds yet. Bring the club back slowly, pause slightly when fully rotated, and have a nice, smooth release and follow through. I can basically guarantee you that you will hit the ball farther with more accuracy and way more consistency than you will if you always try to hammer it. ***Consistency &amp; Accuracy&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Distance.***

* **Not relaxing.** A proper golf swing is very fluid and smooth. If your body is tense and tight, you will not be able to get a good whipping action on the the clubhead which will reduce your distances and also hurt your aim. Try just relaxing with a nice slow swing and see how much easier and better your shots are and body feels. Thanks ChampagneFloozy.

* **Not hitting down on the ball.** This is a counter intuitive point, but go with me on this. In an optimal golf swing, the clubhead will impact the ball while it is still on its downward arc. It will be almost at the bottom, but you are in fact, not scooping the ball into the air. Here's [Tiger demonstrating it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIaWb9pH8SI). The ball gets into the air by the loft of the club, not by you lifting it off the ground. The benefits of this are increased backspin and speed from your club not being slowed down by the grass. To learn this method, try looking an inch or two ahead of the ball and/or adjusting the location of the ball in your stance so the ball is just before your divot starts. Here's a [video on this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94sK9vHG--8).

* **Playing too hard of a course.** There is no need to make golf any more frustrating by introducing narrow fairways and lots of hazards. Consider starting on a short course with few hazards while you’re learning the basics.

* **Playing from the wrong tee box.** There is no shame in not teeing off from the pro tee boxes. Unless you’re a low handicapper, don’t abuse yourself by pushing your limits too early. See this [thread]( http://www.reddit.com/r/golf/comments/1igfky/are_you_teeing_up_from_the_appropriate_tee_boxes/) for more.

* **Losing your stuff.** When you go to putt, you'll often lay your wedge down off the green and forget it when you finish up. [This is a great tip](http://www.reddit.com/r/golf/comments/1cvq0j/only_golf_tip_that_i_have_been_given_that_works/) that will save you major headaches in the future. If I don't lay it on the the flag, I'll be sure to drop my wedge highly visibly on a line between the hole and the cart.

Terrible shank from the golfer, we were in plain sight about 100 yards out, no ""fore"" yelled at all. As I make my way over to him with his golf ball, I realize its a kid of about 15 with a friend who is a little older. They both look just terrified. Once I noticed this I calmed way down and explained very calmly about how you need to appropriately act in this situation, and how if you are unsure of your game and others are nearby you need to take extra precaution. 

I hope the lesson sticks, the bruise on my leg looks like its gonna be a good one!

Some story would also help the content of the thread.  What were the weather conditions, what club did you use, yardage of hole, have you played it before, friends reactions, etc.  Adding any of that would be better than just a picture of a ball in the cup or close to the cup.  I know what those look like...

Personally, if you're going to post those types of pictures, I'd much rather seeing the view from the tee or what shot you just made looked like along with the result rather than just the result.  Granted this might not always be feasible seeing you would have to drive/walk back to your shot or take it ahead of time, but I feel like it would be more unique ... since let's face it, all of the results look more or less the same.

5. Best asset (short game, driving, etc.)  
6. Best club  
7. Ever hit a hole in one?  
8. Average score  
9. Favorite pro golfer  
  
Let me know if you can think of more questions. This was a spur of the moment thing and this was all I could think of. If there is enough interest then I will do it!

If we left anyone out (which we probably did) send me a PM with your handicap and your city in the subject line and we will handle those. Also, please remember we're dealing with hundreds of people and my inbox has been flooded the last few days. We haven't forgotten about you I promise!


*Registration for the Reddit Open will be closing Friday (tonight) at 8 PM. Due to the time constraints if we don't have your username and handicap by tonight you will be dropped from the roster.


*More Flights! We are adding more flights to distribute the field more evenly. Check back later for those, we haven't decided on numbers yet.


*Courses! Go play whatever course you and your team captain decides **BUT** it must have a slope rating from the tees you wish to play. When you decide on a course send me a formal PM with your course and what tees you are going to play so we can add it to the software that /u/ewhitten is so generously providing for us.  

*Dates: The tournament will be ending August 31st. **ALL MATCHES MUST BE COMPLETED BY THEN**


EDIT: We are scrapping the $10 entry fee. We have decided to accept donations that will benefit the First Tee. Check back here later, we are trying to get the website up and running so that it will accept donations. So in the meantime go out and ask your friends and family if they would be willing to donate, the City that raises the most money will get a special flair courtesy of the mods.


EDIT 2: I've also had numerous people ask me ""hey my friend wants to play but he isn't a Redditor, can he play?"" YES he can play, only ONE member of each foursome MUST be a redditor to post the scores so invite anyone you want!

For all who play the game of golf, this story might hit home ",177,25,58,http://www.reddit.com/r/golf/comments/18dknm/as_a_senior_in_high_school_on_the_varsity_golf/,"A little lengthy, but worth it. My dad forwarded it to me this morning after my tournament this weekend, I'm glad he did ~ 

The following was written by a ""former"" golfer who no longer can play, but who has reflected on his years in golf and would like the rest of us to think about how we approach the game. Powerful stuff.

Dear Younger Me :

I can't play golf anymore. I tried to swing the club the other day, but my body wouldn't cooperate. The best I can do now is sometimes take walks on the course, but my eyes aren't as good as they used to be so I don't see much. I have a lot of time to sit and think now, and I often think about the game.

It was my favorite game. I played most of my adult life. Thousands of rounds, thousands of hours practicing. As I look back, I guess I had a pretty good time at it. But now that I can't do it anymore, I wish I had done it differently.

It's funny, but with all the time I spent playing golf, I never thought I was a real golfer. I never felt good enough to really belong out there. It doesn't make much sense, since  I scored better than average and a lot of people envied my game, but I always felt that if I was just a little better or a little more consistent, then I'd feel really good. I'd be satisfied with my game. But I never was. It was always ""One of these days I'll get it"" or ""One day I'll get there"" and now here I am. I can't play anymore, and I never got there.

I met a whole lot of different people out on the course. That was one of the best things about the game. But aside from my regular   partners and a few others, I don't feel like I got to know many of those people very well. I know they didn't really get to know me. At times they probably didn't want to. I was pretty occupied with my own game most of the time and didn't have much time for anyone else, especially if I wasn't playing well.

So why am I writing you this letter anyway, just to complain? Not really. Like I said, my golfing experience wasn't that bad. But it could have been so much better, and I see that so clearly now. I want to tell you, so you can learn from it. I don't want you getting to my age and feeling the same regrets I'm feeling now.

I wish, I wish. Sad words, I suppose, but necessary. I wish I could have played the game with more joy, more freedom. I was always so concerned with ""doing it right"" that I never seemed to be able to enjoy just doing it at all. I was so hard on myself, never satisfied, always expecting more. Who was I trying to please? Certainly not myself, because I never did. If there were people whose opinions were important enough to justify all that self-criticism, I never met them.

I wish I could have been a better playing partner. I wasn't a bad person to be with, really, but I wish I had been friendlier and gotten to know people better. I wish I could have laughed and joked more and given people more encouragement. I probably would have gotten more from them, and I would have loved that. There were a few bad apples over the years, but most of the people I played with were friendly, polite, and sincere. They really just wanted to make friends and have a good time. I wish I could have made more friends and had a better time.

I'm inside a lot now and I miss the beauty of the outdoors. For years when I was golfing I walked through some of the most beautiful places on earth, and yet I don't feel I really saw them. Beautiful landscapes, trees, flowers, animals, the sky, and the ocean - how could I have missed so much? What was I thinking of that was so important - my grip, my back swing, my stance? Sure, I needed to think about those sometimes, but so often as to be oblivious to so much beauty? And all the green - the wonderful, deep, lush color of green! My eyes are starting to fail. I wish I had used them better so I would have more vivid memories now.

So what is it that I'm trying to say? I played the type of game that I thought I should play, to please the type of people that I thought I should please. But it didn't work. My game was mine to play, but I gave it away. It's a wonderful game. Please, don't lose yours. Play a game that you want to play. Play a game that gives you joy and satisfaction and makes you a better person to your family and friends. Play with enthusiasm, play with freedom. Appreciate the beauty of nature and the people around you. Realize how lucky you are to be able to do it. All too soon your time will be up, and you won't be able to play anymore. Play a game that enriches your life.

1376318104.0,148,self.golf,1k7i98,"Now perhaps more golfers will ""waggle""...",186,38,65,http://www.reddit.com/r/golf/comments/1k7i98/now_perhaps_more_golfers_will_waggle/,"I hope Dufner's win will encourage more people to waggle as part of their pre-shot routine.  It more than anything improved my ball striking.

About 7 years ago I found and old set of blades at a thrift and bought them out of curiosity to see if they were really as difficult to hit as everyone warned.    I also got out my the dog-eared copy of Hogan's book inherited from my Dad figuring it would be a good source for understanding how to hit with the type of clubs he used.

I was aware of the waggle thing but never really understood the rationale for doing it.   But in the process of learning to hit those vintage irons at some point out of frustration with failure to hit a decent full swing I tried just keeping my hands perfectly still and whacking balls with just the waggle wrist action Hogan preached in his book.

The cocking / uncocking of the wrists was something I never really focused on because it happen automatically and all the golf instruction I had up until then preached letting it happen naturally.   But by isolating and focusing only on the waggle action **and slowing it down enough to see what was happening**  I realized for the first time how the wrist action opens and then re-squares the clubface just before impact when the lag is finally fully released and **how important keeping the club head outside the hands is to make that action occur correctly and consistently.**

On the range hitting balls with just a waggle of the wrist I didn't hit the balls very far, but for the first time in my golfing experience I was bringing the club head down under the ball and hitting it below it's equator before hitting the range mat.   I started hearing ""click- thump"" rather than the usual ""thump - click"" I was accustomed to.    Because I was just using wrist action I didn't even bother to look up between shots.  But much to my surprise when I did look up all the balls I hit were in a tight circle.

It took a bit of trial and error but I found that when I let my wrist flex down all the way to the point where they got stuck, but before the momentum turned them over my accuracy increased even more.  I realized that self-limiting action in the range of motion of the wrist was acting like a doorstop, bringing the club face predictably back to the same angle just before impact. 

I realized by isolating the wrist action from swinging my hands with the shoulders most of my ball striking inconsistency was a result of not understanding how the wrist action was opening and closing the club face during the swing.  When I swung my arms too fast with my shoulder turn I would sweep the club face still closing with the wrist action though the ball and that open face angle would generate a fade or slice ball flight depending on how far off my timing was.

Another gem of great golfing wisdom in Hogan's book is his 1/2 swing drill when the club is swung only to the point where the hands are about waist level and toe straight up in the takeaway and follow-through **keeping the club head outside the hands the entire time by using the right hand to limit the rotation of the club**.   Using the right hand and forearm tension to control the left and preventing it from pronating (turning palm down) is covered in Hogan's book as a key principle he emphasizes to keep the club from swinging inside too soon and setting up an outside-in slicing path on the way down.  Seeing the toe pointing up when the club is waist level in both directions provides the feedback to know that is being done correctly that can't be seen in a full swing.  That's the main reason the 1/2 swing drill is so helpful; the visual feedback combined with the feel feedback in the hands.  

With my new found understanding of how the waggle action opened and closed the face and how feeling ""stuck"" told me the face was back to square I finally understood the cause and effect for coordinating the timing of the automatic wrist action with the shoulder turn.   It's just a matter of slowing down the shoulder turn to the point where the club has time to some around the hands and flex the wrists down to **consistently and predictably bring the club face under the ball and square to the flight line at the same time.**   The swing ""key"" was feeling that fully flexed ""stuck"" feeling as in the end of a fly rod cast in my wrists a split second before hearing the ""click - whack"" of solid ball striking.

I practiced hundreds of shots using Hogan's 1/2 swing drill and just my 7i until I could create  tight groups around the 100 yd. pole.  That's all the further my 1/2 effort 7i shots went, and they had a low trajectory but they were very accurate.   But then by gradually adding more backswing and the same amount of finish I increased the distance to 110, 120, 130, 140, 150, 160, and 170 yards when swinging at 100%.   Thanks to the improved mechanics engrained by rote with the 1/2 swing drill the accuracy stayed consistent with a predictable slight draw shot shape up to the point where I was swinging about 80% and hitting the 7i 150 yards. 

With just that 7i exercise I learned to hit the blades without fear of failure and hit my 7i accurately at any distance between 100 and 150 yards simply by changing the amount of backswing and keying on getting that ""stuck - click - thump"" sequence with the wrists and bringing the club face under the  ball and hitting it cleanly before the club hit the mat.  Just the fact the club hit the ball first consistently improved distance and accuracy 20 - 30% even when I didn't hit the tiny ""sweet spot"" of the club perfectly.

I repeated the same drills with all my other irons, starting with wrist only waggle strikes, then Hogan's 1/2 swing drill, and then extending the backswing from 50% to 100%.    

Doing those drills with the longer irons like my 3i helped me appreciate that as the shafts get longer the swing arc increases and it takes longer for the hands to get the club moving and for it to come around the hands.   But when it is allowed to come fully around and square with the same ""stuck - click - thump"" action the ball goes a long way.   Where as a 1/2 swing 7i send the ball 100yds down range a well struck 1/2 swing 3i with good lag / release would go about 130 - 140yds.   Increasing the back swing to 80% only added about 60-70 yards.  Trying to swing the longer clubs any harder than 80% caused my arms and hands to tense up and restrict the automatic lag /release resulting in shorter less accurate shots.

At the end of a month of using that old set of $16 blades from the thrift store as a training aids and Ben Hogan as my instructor my golf game was 100% better than it had been before mechanically.  I also gained an understanding of how to get any yardage with any club and what trajectory, carry and roll roll distance I could expect  from each.   That changed my strategic approach to course management.  

I no longer had one ""100 yard club"" I had about 6 of them, each producing the same distance but with different trajectories.  That combined with knowing how to hit them with straight, fade or draw action gave me an inventory of 6 x 3 =  18 different 100 yard shots to select from as the best strategy. I started doing things like hitting 30 yard uphill approach shots with a 7, 6 and even 5 irons that I never would have even considered possible much less pull off successfully most of the time.  Not surprisingly becoming more competent and strategic made the game a lot more fun. 

So if you are a beginner or still struggle with consistent ball striking and accuracy try waggling and the drills mentioned above that demonstrate what it does in the golf swing that you may not understand or appreciate yet.

1376403924.0,145,self.golf,1ka1to,What my grandfather (unknowingly) taught me about golf &amp; life,166,21,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/golf/comments/1ka1to/what_my_grandfather_unknowingly_taught_me_about/,"This story was one of the last stories that my grandfather ever told me before he passed (later confirmed by my grandmother &amp; great uncle). This is a long story.  Don't down vote because of the length.  If you don't want to read, please just move on, this is not the post for you.    





My grandfather was an extremely gifted athlete.  He held football &amp; track records for years at his high school &amp; received a full ride to University of Illinois on a track scholarship.  He was then drafted into the army and his collegiate athletics were done.  When he returned home, he met &amp; married my grandmother who he loved more than anything (KEEP READING).





On to how that fits into golf.  Every day after work, he would head over to the local 9 hole course.  From what I have been told, he would consistently shoot around par and had a short game that was UNBELIEVABLE.  On Sundays, he had a group of friends that were called the ""Dew Dusters.""  They would travel around the area playing 18 holes on the earliest available tee times.  He played in local tournaments &amp; from the trophies that we found in his closet, he won them quite often.  





One day, after his daily 9 holes, a neighbor approached him in his driveway.  After chatting about his recent round, the man said to him, ""How does your wife feel about you golfing all the time?  With 3 kids, a job, &amp; a house to maintain, I would have to think that she misses you.""  My grandfather looked him in the eye &amp; said, ""You know what, I have never thought about that.""  My grandfather said goodbye to the neighbor and took his clubs into the garage.  He went into the house for dinner the way that he always had.  That was the last day that my grandfather ever swung a golf club.





It wasn't until years later, after his knees were too shot to think about playing again, that the neighbor told my grandmother about this interaction.  When approached, all my grandfather could say was, ""I love you more than I loved golf.""





I love this story because I am obsessed with the game of golf.  I don't think I could ever give up the game.  I think about, dream about it, spend any extra money I can scrounge up on it.  I think we all do.  That's why we visit this sub.  However, golf enthusiasts in general tend to take the game too seriously.  We attack internet posters who claim to have a 130mph golf swing or that they hit their 60* wedge 160 yds.  Those of us who have been blessed with the talent/means/opportunity to become decent at the game, criticize ourselves too harshly.  We skip posts about people who are excited to have broken 110 for the first time when we should be joining in their celebration.  The fact is, golf is a game.  It is the GREATEST game, but it is still a game.  We should all enjoy it &amp; love it &amp; encourage those who share our love while still keeping in mind that there are more important things in life.  When the game can no longer be played, when the last putt drops, what do you have?  





I love my wife &amp; son (&amp; another on the way).  I love them beyond anything in this world.  And it is my love for them that allows me to enjoy the game of golf that much more.  





I now have my grandfather's set of clubs next to mine in my garage.  Every time I load my bag in my trunk, it is a reminder that while I will be upset if I hit a bad drive, chunk an approach from the fairway, or miss a short putt, in the end it isn't whats important.  Its that I had the opportunity to do what I love &amp; did it while I had the chance.  
 




Enjoy the game everyone.    ",,False,,t5_2qhcs,False,,mizuno,True,t3_1ka1to,http://www.reddit.com/r/golf/comments/1ka1to/what_my_grandfather_unknowingly_taught_me_about/,

When I talked to him at the office yesterday, he had an awesome story to tell.

He attended the tournament with his son, who is a huge golf fan, but confined to a wheelchair.

Both of them were having a blast on Sunday after Saturday's rainout, but they weren't able to see all of the course due to the wheelchair and so many sandy areas where fans had to walk. Late in the day on Sunday, none other than David Feherty walks up and starts talking to my coworker.

After hearing that they were having some trouble getting around, he gave them his all-access pass, allowing them to use some much easier (and not accessible to the public) paths.

They were able to mingle with the players' wives and hang out with players in the clubhouse. Based on the pictures my coworker showed me, his son was given an entire memorabilia room full of signed balls, gloves, hats, etc. from some of the best golfers on earth.

They got to sit and have a drink with Graeme McDowell and Rory McIlroy's father as Rory cruised to the win. In fact, I was given an account of how awesome a bunch of golfers were (pretty much a who's who of the European Ryder Cup team). Even Tiger took the time after his round to pose for a picture and sign a ball for the kid. The best part was that Rory stopped by, fresh off of dominating the weekend, and gladly shared a few minutes.

All in all, it was one of the coolest stories I've ever heard. It's one thing to hear about random encounters where a single celebrity turns out to be an awesome guy/girl, but this was apparently 2-plus hours of world-class golfers - fresh off of the intensity and focus of one of the biggest weekends of the year - taking the time to just be generally cool guys.

TL;DR - Coworker and his kid went to PGA Championship. Some of the best golfers in the world contributed to the awesomeness of their day.",,False,,t5_2qhcs,False,,,True,t3_y8281,http://www.reddit.com/r/golf/comments/y8281/great_story_from_the_pga_chamionship/,

Well we came to the 3rd hole: a par 3, 145 yards uphill. My Dad stepped up to the tee and took his swing. As we watched the ball sore through the air, we saw it take one bounce and roll to the left. As it rolled left, it vanished and we didn't know what to think. In a moment of confusion, we looked at each other and probably thought the same thing: ""did that just go in?"" As we approached the green, we only saw my golf ball so we slowly walked up to the hole and discovered that it had indeed went in.

So I've been off the course for pretty much a fortnight now (exams! AND it's been the hottest two days of the year so far). This has lead to much fantasizing over Cameron's, Bettinardi's etc. Problem is... There's no way I could afford one (bloody students!). So I finish exams on tuesday, and after that's done I'm gonna set about trying to design and build my own putter from scratch. 

Any of you guys got any experience with anything like this?

http://redd.it/1ivmtw

First of all I want to thank everyone for their participation! Without you guys we couldn't make this happen. We tried our best last night to make a preliminary roster, if your name is not on there PM the team captain from that citys team and they will relay that information to me, it's just easier that way. ALSO, if you do not see your city on there and would like to be on there PM me your roster, the deadline for teams is Friday July 26th at 8 PM EST. After that I will not be changing teams.  

We have settled on a format!

It will be a USGA governed, stroke play competition where we will rely **heavily** on the honor system. The play will include an individual flighted 1st, 2nd and 3rd place, Individual LOW GROSS **and** Individual LOW NET

Flights are:

&amp;lt;10

10-20

20+

There will also be a CITY vs CITY competition, the four lowest net scores will be taken from there and the winning city will (hopefully) be awarded a banner in the Reddit golf page. (We need to talk with the mods about that)

We have also decided that there will be a $10 entry fee (if any problems PM /u/donkey_puncher_eyok). This money will not be pocketed, it will be going towards some awesome trophies for each winner. I have contacted a trophy making company about the design, and I can assure you they will be some AWESOME trophies! Also, we are working on getting a website up and running to take payment info so it is not someones personal paypal account. 

The current [roster](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Asqv2rz6gbSDdFRVRUs2cXM0UVVrY2VZT3NMVlVGU3c&amp;amp;usp=sharing) is shown here. We really need Handicaps and emails for contact. Please! Please! Send this information to your city captain (username listed in bold). 

Also, if anyone wants to join to leave please let the area captain know and he/she will pass it on to either myself or /u/donkey_puncher_eyok. If you’re area does not currently have a team then feel free to create one and let me know. 

Lastly, I’d like to thank /u/ewhitten for helping us set up the logistics and offering us his software. Without him this would not be possible. And mods, if you are reading this please PM me. 

Check back here often for updates as I add new updates all the time.

It probably helps that in the two times I went out I only had 1 penalty shot. I didn't score any Triple bogeys (which isn't normal for me). I feel really good. I was only 2 over par on the 7th hole, but ended up scoring 5 over for 9. I'm still waiting to break 40 for 9 holes.

[Download the live tracking spreadsheet here](https://mega.co.nz/#!hphg0aCB!HTSkQmjqr-gWmXgtdIS5gQkZzxVlVqU0KeCpfD1SgM4)

As the title says, the pool is officially underway! There were 817 entries, and of those 817, only 6 were bold enough not to pick Tiger Woods.

Also, as an FYI: I replaced all selections of Darren Clarke (who withdrew) with your alternate golfer. I also replaced any duplicate golfers with your alternate golfer. If you had a duplicate or Darren Clarke and did not have an alternate listed, I gave you the first person alphabetically (Thomas Bjorn). This should explain why some of you (25-30 or so) may have slightly different picks than what you thought you originally entered.

As far as the spreadsheet goes, all you have to do is open it up, and click to ""Enable Content"" and ""Enable Editing"" if Excel asks you to. This will allow it to refresh ESPN's leaderboard every minute, and the standings in the file will update accordingly. Additionally, if you put your username into the box on the front sheet, it will highlight your place in the standings for you to find it easier.

As posted yesterday, the prizes are as follows:

**FIRST PLACE PRIZE PACKAGE**

* First, the wonderful folks over at www.callawaygolfpreowned.com have agreed to donate a new Callaway RAZR X Black 9.5 stiff driver to the winner! Big thanks to them for this offer!
* /u/Whataputt22 has offered to donate a box of ProV1's or ProV1x's depending on the players preference ([source](http://www.reddit.com/r/golf/comments/1byiwg/2013_masters_pool_update_and_prize_summary/c9bszpj))

* From /u/morepleasethankyou who will be attending the Masters, a token from Augusta National itself, most likely a ball marker or something similar (just trust me on this one, it came as a message, not a comment)

**Second Place**

* /u/TailoredFrog has offered to donate ""a prize, not sure what, but something"" ([source](http://www.reddit.com/r/golf/comments/1byiwg/2013_masters_pool_update_and_prize_summary/c9bmn02))

Please let me know if the spreadsheet breaks at any point (ESPN likes to change their formatting every now and then) and I'll do my best to get it fixed asap!

With Martin Laird's victory at the Valero Texas Open, the field for the 2013 Masters is officially set!

[SUBMIT YOUR ENTRY HERE](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/18ZXfAlfg8PbbyyHMQTOpEUPzY-_M9FvqQtyFjuKNmEg/viewform)

**RULES**

* Select any 12 golfers
* At the end of the week, the lowest total of positions will win
* Any missed cut, disqualified, or withdrawal will be counted as the number of players who make the cut plus a 20 point penalty
* In the event of a tie, the #1 golfers will be compared, followed by the #2 golfers, etc. until the tie is broken
* Only one entry allowed per username
* Any entries with blanks or with duplicate golfers will not be counted
* The alternate spot will only be used if a golfer withdraws *prior* to the event starting. Once the first player tees off on Thursday morning, everything is final

I think that's it! I don't know if we've finalized what the prize is going to be for this year's pool, so anybody with ideas/suggestions, feel free to chime in.

Also, I'll be around over the next couple days to answer any questions/concerns everyone may have. Good luck!

Edit: I previously had the confirmation page linking to the results summary, which could be unfair for people who are entering later on, as they could see what the pick trends are. I've taken this functionality off for now, but don't worry, I'm putting together all the information you could possibly want, and I'll share it with you guys first thing Thursday morning when the picks go final!

**UPDATE**

The form has been live for 2 hours, and we've already hit 50 entrants! Keep em coming people! We also have our first part of a prize being offered by /u/motorboatingsofab , but keep me posted if there are any other prizes that people have to offer! ([source](http://www.reddit.com/r/golf/comments/1bvkl1/2013_rgolf_masters_pool_official_entry_form/c9aj1o1))

**ANOTHER UPDATE**

We've hit 100 entries! And it's still Sunday night! I'm quite pleased, and a bit surprised at how quick the response has been to this. Also, /u/joetromboni has offered up a sleeve of Pro-V1s to the winner! ([source](http://www.reddit.com/r/golf/comments/1bvkl1/2013_rgolf_masters_pool_official_entry_form/c9ajt89))

1372623543.0,112,self.golf,1hdrsd,The Mental Game,127,15,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/golf/comments/1hdrsd/the_mental_game/,"I'm a competitive person by nature and golf was a sport I picked up later (relatively) to the other sports I'm active with. I played it with a lot of thought and practice and sweat, hitting buckets of practice balls on 100 degree days. For all of that effort, I just never had the type of skill I had with other sports where I could contend with college level players and beyond. It was infuriating. But I'm not the type of person to quit and that only made me more focused.

My friends were all pretty talented. One could shoot par right or left handed, another could routinely drive the ball 340+, while another was hitting 225 yard drives but still scoring routinely under par.

I however, always floated between 80-100 with flashes of brilliance and remarkable ineptitude.

There was noted improvement for a couple of years where I started to break 90 on a consistent basis, but then real life took over and the course wasn't as accessible as it used to be. I was happy to get out on the occasional weekend, but I still wanted to play it like I did everything else - full tilt.

The past two years were extremely difficult. My Grandfather (who for all intents and purposes is my father) became very ill. He and I had always golfed together and he would give me a hard time if I ever lost my temper, which was rare, and usually little more than a disgruntled look. Even still, he thought that it was silly to become upset while playing golf. ""It's only a game,"" he would say.

There was a joke we had that we were the only two guys to freeze to death during the heatwave last summer because the damn hospitals were always so cold. I didn't make it out to any rounds and spent a lot of nights sleeping in a chair beside him. We watched a lot of golf on the crappy TV. He fought the disease, two surgeries, chemo and radiation, and won!

But a few months ago we learned that the big C had returned and this time there weren't any realistic options for us. It robbed him of his strength, dignity, cognition, and he became bedridden. Each day was more and more exhausting and no matter how much I wanted to be there for every second, I simply couldn't take the stress.

My friends convinced me to get away for a few hours with them and honestly, I didn't put up much of a fight.

For once I didn't care about anything except for being somewhere other than a hospital. It was 78 and sunny. The ground was a little soft from a rain the night before. I hadn't swung a club in almost a year. My warm up was just sitting in the cart and joking around with my friends.

The game I had tried so hard at for so long wasn't as I remembered it. There was a different mind-set for me. It wasn't about the next shot or the one I'd just duffed. It was about 4 hours of something other than feeling like shit, even though I knew deep down that's how I would feel when it ended and I drove back to the house.

We laughed and cried and threw beer cans into trash cans in the middle of each other's swings. I called my shot prior to stepping on the tee (eagle) and did. But it really didn't matter. All that mattered was the game had changed. I didn't need to win. But I did... with a 74 and my Dad saw the card. 

""It's only a game.""

I was depressed and hated to wake up everyday and not be going to work. My wife came to me while I was in the back yard chipping golf balls into a bucket and handed me a stack of money and told me to follow my dreams. Since that day I have spent countless hours in the backyard chipping or at my local course putting until midnight or later.

I never had full blooded siblings, but I had a guy that was basically my brother growing up. He agreed to sponsor me on my first ever tournament in October!  Ever since I signed up I have been having trouble sleeping because deep down I feel like there is someone else out there that's still awake, and practicing. 

I have played golf since I was three years old (currently 24). I played high school golf, made all conference twice and missed the state by 5 strokes. I did not play college golf because who really offers someone who missed the state cut by 5 strokes a scholarship to play golf? No one that's who. This never pushed me away from my dreams though, I played rain or shine every day after class and 36 holes on Saturday and Sunday. 

After I started my job in 2010 I didn't get to play hardly at all due to work, but now that time isn't an option I am on the golf course daily, in the yard making chip shots or on a putting green. 

Today I had a huge break through, I shot three under at the course I will play my first tournament on in October. I am more motivated and driven than I ever have been in my life about this dream of mine. 

EDIT: I want to thank each one of you for your support and encouragement. I am currently at the putting green and driving range and my wife is reading the messages and comments to me while I play. Keep the motivation coming, If I ever do make it to the tour I want you all to know that I will repay this community somehow! I am just not playing for myself, but for other who share the same dream but cannot find the time or money to do so. I truly appreciate everything you have shared with me! I have a 4pm tee time this afternoon at a local Pete Dye course, I will try and post a picture of my scorecard after I am finished to keep you all posted.

I have a dream that someday I will be able to play pebble beach, Augusta national or TCP sawgrass one day, and if by some Devine miracle it does come true, look for the player that had the reddit patch on his golf bag",,False,,t5_2qhcs,1339778377.0,,,True,t3_v2wat,http://www.reddit.com/r/golf/comments/v2wat/four_months_ago_i_lost_my_job_my_wife_and_family/,

Preamble - queue at 6am on Monday morning (single players cannot go in for the ballot), there is about 20 guys waiting. I get put on the list last and get told to check back at midday but the starter doubts I can get out. Go back at 12 and people have been 'dropping like flies' and to check back at 1pm. At 1pm he says I can get out at 1.50pm. Elation and nerves.
The first tee - pay £150 (about $8000 dollars or something) and get ushered to the tee with middle aged Dutchman called Braum (he plays off 7 and is very solid and a good laugh). We get a few pictures taken (on the insistence of the starter, nice chap that he is) and then are ready to hit. Caddie thinks it is 20mph wind into the face so aim left of centre and rip it. I do, mind cleared and made a good swing. Off and running.
Front 9 - play it in +13. Pretty bad scoring and fail to make a par, into the wind means everything is playing long and it is dry and the undulations are just mental.
Back 9 - play it in +5. Solid, triple bogey 14 but play everything else well, up and down from 2 bunkers. Drive over the hotel on the road hole (17th) and hit 3 wood 190 into crosswind to 20 feet, just miss birdie putt. Braum keeps talking about how I am hitting 'IKEA' drives. I have no idea what he means, he later reveals it is because you could build an IKEA between his ball and mine.
Best moment of the round - 18 - drive up left side of fairway, quite a few people watching, pitch and run a 7 iron from 40 yards to 15 feet, get applause, give a little wave. Leave putt pin high and tap in.
Pure heaven. Would recommend it to anyone. The whole experience i mean, not the putt on 18, it doesn't break as much as you would think.",,False,,t5_2qhcs,False,,,True,t3_zdztc,http://www.reddit.com/r/golf/comments/zdztc/played_old_course_at_st_andrews_on_monday/,

1340308913.0,100,self.golf,vecfg,"A true ""big break"" for my son in golf...",110,10,46,http://www.reddit.com/r/golf/comments/vecfg/a_true_big_break_for_my_son_in_golf/,"My son is 11 and has been golfing in some way or another since he was about 4 (around the house, then in the yard, then range, then finally on the course at age 7, now we play in a 2 person scramble in a league each week).  Anyway, he has the potential to be a very good golfer in my opinion just based on his natural feel.  (example:  he has four chip ins for birdie just this year alone and we have only played about 9 rounds.)  He was an all-star baseball player (decided he didn't like baseball though) and is being heavily recruited for football already (he isn't going to play football / that's a different discussion)  I basically have taken him as far as I can with my ""book and Golf Channel"" self-taught lessons so I was looking for some way to help him get better, get on the high-school team and possibly a scholarship (but that is a long way away).

Anyway the course we play has a volunteer golf pro who was on the Nationwide Tour for a few years and a few PGA events and is prepping to go back to Q school and jump back in.  He is the best golfer around where I live by far and he gives lessons.  I couldn't afford them but a friend of mine has been taking some and has helped my friend quite a bit in a short time.  I don't want to give out his name without his permission.

To make a long story short*, after my friend mentioned my son to the pro, the pro approached us last night and chatted for a while and then tells my son to go grab his bag so he can watch him hit some balls.  He gets very excited (he knew who this guy was) and runs off to get his bag.  The pro pulls me aside and tells me he was helped by a club pro when he was younger who never charged a dime who told him that to repay him, he hoped he would do that for some kid sometime.  Well, he apparently chose my son to be at least one of the kids he helps.  

Within 5 minutes and a couple of simple lessons my son was hitting an adult sized 7 iron (which was brand new to him as I had just purchased a set at a garage sale for $15) 150 yards...and right on target (which is about what I hit my 7 iron... except for the on target part).   Now, the round we had just played, he had been using his junior 3 wood for 150 yards shots.  This guy is a tremendous teacher and was able to convey the swing thoughts and ideas I had thought I was teaching in a MUCH better way than I was doing.  

The pro even gave me the ""not bad"" face when he was hitting.  He wrote us into his book for every week lessons, gave us his number, gave my son a notebook to write his lessons in and even said he would help me with recruiting when that time came (I still have 6 years of prep for that).  

My son is THE most excited about golf he has been since he was about 5 years old.  He wanted to hit the driving range today (I have to work both jobs today so I can't) but he is working on his fitness and practicing putting at home instead of playing X-box all day.  THAT is the best thing to come out of this.  

I just had to share my story and I really want to give out the Pro's name but I don't like to do stuff like that without clearing it first and I would hate to do that and make him mad but he is really a good guy and a GREAT teacher I hope he kills it on tour and gets his PGA card. 

Now I have to figure out where to get the money to enter my son into junior tournaments etc. that he will want to enter next year and beyond but that is a good problem to have in my opinion and I have some time to do it.   

I'm still just beside myself at this good fortune. If I feel comfortable with giving out his name I will make a ""Good Guy Golf Pro"" meme. (because what the world needs is more memes)

1374160458.0,99,self.golf,1ik9wa,Practice Tips,109,10,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/golf/comments/1ik9wa/practice_tips/,"Just thought I would share some advice with everybody that I've learned over the years. I've played since I was little and I was about a 2 handicap when I was playing everyday in high school so I hope I can help someone get better at this ridiculous game.

**Short Game**

The rule is simple.. For any amount of time you spend practicing golf, 2/3 of the time you should be practicing short game. The easiest way to lower your scores no matter what handicap is improving your short game. An average player can get the ball within 25 yards in two shots on any given par 4, but the difference between a great golfer and an average one is the great golfer can get from 25 yards to the hole in 2 shots the majority of the time. I cant stress the importance of short game practice enough.

**On The Range**

Please take your time.. Take every shot on the range with purpose, don't just hit to hit, and take the time you need to regain your composure before each shot. This is especially important when you play in humid hot climates like me. Another thing is move around before you hit your next shot, get used to having to go in and out of your set-up. I easily take twice as long as other people I see on the range with the same amount of golf balls. If you're short on time for practice just hit less balls, don't speed up just to get you're moneys worth.

**Dealing with Pressure**

We all feel it, whether we're playing with friends for money, trying to sink that put to break your low score, or playing in competition. The best thing you can do to help your performance in pressure situations is learning to control your breathing. So next time you're working out in the gym or you find yourself physically exhausted in any way where you are gasping for air, don't gasp for air. Close your mouth and breath slowly out of your nose. Its pretty hard at first but if you get good at breathing when exhausted you're preparing your body to deal with the pressure your mind puts on your body. 
Another trick I learned from a sports psychologist is the feeling you get when your nervous is actually the exact same feeling as when you're excited but our minds associate different names to each feeling. You can convince your mind that your not nervous by simply stating to yourself that your excited. This did wonders for me it might help you too!

**Swing Tips**

The two best swing tips I was ever given was keep your wrist loose and keep your swing short. For the vast majority of golfers, a 3/4 swing is all that is required for maximum clubhead speed. This ties in with the first tip because you get the most clubhead speed from the 9 o'clock position to the 3 o'clock position and that is due to the whip your wrist create. If you've ever wondered why that guy who couldn't lift half of what you could lift hits it 50 yards further, its because he keeps his wrist loose through his swing so he creates a violent whip-like action with the golf club.

Lastly I urge anyone who wants to not only get better at golf but be better at everything in life to exercise and do yoga. Starting to do yoga once a week was easily one of the best decisions I've ever made. Not only will exercise and yoga lead to a healthier and better feeling you but you will see how everything in golf and life becomes a little easier. If you've read this far I hope something here will help you with your game. Feel free to ask any questions!

I was at 85 with one hole left, a 420 yard par 4. Need a par to break 90, a double bogey to get my best score ever. 

First shot:
I tee off and hit it pretty badly. Goes about 200 yards and has a little slice to it. 

second shot:
I'm still 220 yards out so I pull out my 3-hybrid and strike it pretty well and it goes about 205 yards but takes a horrible bounce RIGHT and puts me on the front edge of a bunker. 

Third shot:
Now all I have to do is chip it over the bunker and one putt to break 90. If I 2 putt, I get 90 which is still my best score ever. 

I line myself up, do a few practice swings and I kept telling myself to not go into the bunker. I hit my 60 degree and it goes over the bunker......... and over the green. 

Fourth shot:
I'm about 5 feet from the green (about 20 feet to hole). I pull out my PW and hit it pretty well knowing I need this to go into the hole for my 89. It lands about 10 feet from the hole and starts rolling right on line, 5 feet from the hole, 4 feet, 3 feet, 2 feet, starts to break and just misses by a few inches and stops about 7 feet away. Missed my 89. I was bummed but still wanted to get a 90..I ended up 3 putting from there to shoot a fucking 92. Fuck you golf, I'll be back next weekend to be fucked again.

1323958115.0,98,self.golf,ndrye,24 Laws of Golf,111,13,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/golf/comments/ndrye/24_laws_of_golf/,"LAW 1:
No matter how bad your last shot was, you should have Inner Peace knowing that a shittier one is yet to come.  This law does not expire on the 18th hole, since it has the supernatural tendency to extend over the course of a tournament, a summer and, eventually, a lifetime.

LAW 2:
Your best round of golf will be followed almost immediately by your worst round ever. The probability of the latter increases with the number of people you tell about the former.

LAW 3:
Brand new golf balls are water-magnetic.  Though this cannot be proven in the lab, it is a known fact that the more expensive the golf ball, the greater its attraction to water. Expensive clubs have been known to be partly made with this most unusual natural alloy.

LAW 4:
Golf balls never bounce off of trees back into play.  If one does, the tree is breaking a law of the universe and should be cut down.

LAW 5:
The higher a golfer's handicap, the more qualified he deems himself as an instructor.

LAW 6:
A golfer hitting into your group will always be bigger than anyone in your group. Likewise, a group you accidentally hit into will consist of a football player, a professional wrestler, a convicted murderer and an IRS agent -- or some similar combination.

LAW 7:
All 3-woods are demon-possessed.  Your Mother in Law does not come  close.

LAW 8:
Golf balls from the same ""sleeve"" tend to follow one another, particularly out of bounds or into the water.   See LAW 3.
 
LAW 9:
The last three holes of a round will automatically adjust your score to what it really should be.

LAW 10:
Golf should be given up at least twice per month.

LAW 11:
All vows taken on a golf course shall be valid only until the sunset.

LAW 12:
Since bad shots come in groups of three, your fourth consecutive bad shot is really the beginning of the next group of three.

LAW 13:
If it isn't broke, try changing your grip.
  
LAW 14:
It's surprisingly easy to hole a 50-foot putt when you lie 8.

LAW 15:
Counting on your opponent to inform you when he breaks a rule is like expecting him to make fun of his own haircut. 


LAW 16: 
Nonchalant putts count the same as chalant putts.

LAW 17: 
It's not a gimme if you're still 4 feet away.
   
LAW 18: 
The shortest distance between any two points on a golf course is a straight line that passes directly through the centre of a very large tree.

LAW 19: 
You can hit a 2-acre fairway 10% of the time, and a 2-inch branch 90% of the time.

LAW 20:  
Every Time a golfer makes a birdie, he must subsequently make a double or triple bogey to restore the fundamental equilibrium of the universe.

LAW  21: 
If you want to hit a 7-iron as far as Tiger Woods does, simply try to use it to lay up just short of a water hazard.

LAW 22: 
There are two things you can learn by stopping your backswing at the top and checking the position of your hands: how many hands you have, and which one is wearing the glove.
   
LAW  23:
A ball you can see in the rough from 50 yards away is not yours.

LAW  24:
Don't buy a putter until you've had a chance to throw it.",,False,,t5_2qhcs,False,,,True,t3_ndrye,http://www.reddit.com/r/golf/comments/ndrye/24_laws_of_golf/,

It's not just due to slow play (though that has always been a peeve among golfers).  This is about enjoying the game.  In all the years I've played golf, I've watched countless golfers abuse themselves when they would have enjoyed their round far more by playing from the right tee boxes.  

The idea set down by the PGA is to encourage golfers to play from the appropriate tees based on the course distance, and the average driving distance and handicap of the golfer. The point of spending the day on the golf course is to have a good time. It's hard to enjoy a round when loosing balls, consistently missing FIR and GIR, and continuously grabbing a 4 iron or hybrid to reach the green in regulation. 

For most weekend golfers, this makes complete sense.  Golf requires an enormous amount of practice time, and most weekend golfers just don't have that time to develop every aspect of their game, *plus* try to increase and maintain the necessary club head speed to play consistently well from the back tees.  This is one decision by the PGA that I will fully support.  There's no shame in playing from the forward tees.  Play from the forward tees and you'll enjoy your round much more!",,False,,t5_2qhcs,False,,,True,t3_1igfky,http://www.reddit.com/r/golf/comments/1igfky/are_you_teeing_up_from_the_appropriate_tee_boxes/,

You owe it to yourself, at least once in your life, to play with an elderly couple, and here's why.

I went yesterday to walk nine holes by myself.  I was looking forward to the downtime and the opportunity to be by myself.  Well the course was much busier than expected, so the starter informed me that they were pairing me with a couple.

The couples names were Al and Claudette, and they were in their mid 70's.  Only Al played, but Claudette enjoyed spending time with him, so she drove the cart.  That itself was sweet.

Topics of discussion ranged from past golfing experiences, to school, to the slow play of the threesome in front of us.  Each new hole meant it was time for a new cigarette for the both of them.  I soon got used to the sight of Al standing over the ball, a Marlboro angled out of his mouth.

By the time we were done with our nine, I was truly sorry to see us go our separate ways.  Most people I play with, I'm done socializing with them after about six holes.  But I was sad to see my new friends go.

In conclusion, dear reader, try to get out on the links with the elderly.  They are truly amazing people and can definitely teach you a thing or two.  Also, they tend to be mildly racist, which is good for some laughs.",,False,,t5_2qhcs,False,,nike,True,t3_1els3x,http://www.reddit.com/r/golf/comments/1els3x/a_psa_for_you_all/,

Augusta is my hometown, so for me it means Spring Break, lots of traffic, lots of beer, and good times with friends walking the most beautiful golf course I've ever seen.

If you're going to Augusta this week, have a great time! And, be sure to visit some local places that make the city special. 

Luigi's on Broad Street. Luigi's has been a staple of Italian food since the 40's. It's the first place my grandparents had exotic dishes like pizza and spaghetti! I don't know if they make the very best Italian food in the world... but, it's perfect for Augusta. (And, apparently Ben Crenshaw was there the other night!)

Vallarta's on Washington Road. The deck is the perfect place to people watch and drink margarita's. 

Sconyer's BBQ. This place is an institution. Sconyer's IS Augusta. Now, I have a friend who owns another BBQ place in Augusta, and I would never say this to his face, but Sconyer's is just the best BBQ anywhere ever. You don't like BBQ... I don't care, go, get some. Not your favorite? Go, try it again. Sconyer's bread is so fresh you get it the day before it's made. Their bread and butter pickles are special. The tea is perfect. (and, the pig with the peppermint sticks is perfectly clean, grandmother. ;-)

On the course.

My personal favorite spot is on the pond at 16. For me it's the perfect hole: I can see the tee and the green. During practice rounds the golfers will skip the ball through the pond, which is always fun.

My husband's favorite spot is the green at 10. It's always been his favorite hole, mainly because of the insane sand trap!

Yes, they stop serving beer at 4. In my younger days we played the ""how many beers can you hold game."" In which we would all get in line at 3:45 to buy as many as we could carry. (I can safely hold three in each hand) When they are gone, you're pretty much ready to find your designated driver and head somewhere else to continue drinking, talk about your sunburn, and show off your new hat or visor!

So, if you're heading to Augusta this week, or you're already there, have FUN!!! And, enjoy the golf!",,False,,t5_2qhcs,1365424796.0,,,True,t3_1bww09,http://www.reddit.com/r/golf/comments/1bww09/my_favorite_spots_for_the_masters/,

Today, I went to my parents' house for Easter dinner.  My uncle said he had something for me.  He brought me outside and opened the shed door.  There was a bag with a partial set of golf clubs inside of it.  He informed me that they had belonged to my cousin, who passed away last August.  He and my aunt wanted to keep them in the family.

I have no way of sending word to my cousin to thank him and to let him know that I am honored to have them, so this post on reddit will have to suffice.

*[thanks to biff for the golf box heads up last week](http://www.reddit.com/r/golf/comments/13ax8h/dancin_dogg_optishot_infrared_golf_simulator_in/)

So it was a perfect storm. A fellow golfiter posted about am Amazon golf (sic) box deal for an OptiShot at around 50% off. I hadn't been to the range or on the course in a month. No range and no course, means I had an excess budget of $200 or so... So I impulse bought the damn thing. I bought it, then called my wife to tell her what I did. 

""hello honey."" 

""yes sire, master long dong, lord of our manor, what can I do for you?"" 

""Well I kind of bought a golf simulator"" 

""Whatever our head of home needs to be happy, would you be having your B.J. as usual tonight, or will you be golfing?"" 

""Are you sure you're not annoyed with my impulse purchase? and the simulator won't be here until Tuesday, so, uh yes, as usual dear."" 

""You work so hard, you deserve all the golf you can get"" 

""Thanks babe."" 

So as you can imagine, I never called my wife to tell her, and she has yet to see the bank statement. So on to my review! 

The perfect storm indeed. I had in my garage my gaming computer, that I built about 3 years ago, it was top of the line, but my kids peeled off the CD-ROM covers and poked it with a bunch of shit, so I never hooked it back up. Also in my garage was a projector from my old business, it has always been spotty, so I had a monitor back up. I knew all of this stuff was there, waiting, for purpose, waiting, for a golf simulator in my garage. 

I didn't have time to clean, I didn't have time to set up a screen for balls to fly into, I wanted to do one thing, and fast, hit some muther fn golf balls, on a mother fn golf simulator. 

So I unboxed it, and low and behold, there was a freeking concrete brick in the box. No, I'm kidding, but man does that suck, I always give those poor people upvotes, even if they are karma whoring me. 

The packaging is super, almost over the top, but great use of glossy black cardboard and printed support materials. Packaging like this in a store makes me nervous, because being in marketing as a career, tells me that I'm the one paying for this slick box. I also over-think everything. I tore through the packaging but saved all the bits so I could half-ass put it back together if I needed to return it. 

I looked at the chunk of a mat, it was pretty thick. brushed a finder over the little sensors wondering if they would shatter with a direct hit from a errant wedge...  I set it down and went to the garage. 

Now the set up of this simulator is just as important and even more expensive than the device itself. The main thing is ROOM SIZE. I'd be pissed off like a fly on a toilet seat if I bought this and never fully tested my practice space. Sure you can use it on a TV or computer monitor, but I didn't want to do that. I found all the assorted computer equipment and projectors I had laying around and set them up as quickly as I could. I used an old ass projector on a wheeled laptop table, and I put my desktop on the mechanics roller pad so that I could push them around. I changed some corroded batteries in my microsoft wireless keyboard and mouse, and amazingly all the shit worked! 

It was time to plug in the chunk of a mat. 

IT plugged in, and lit up. Yay. 

I installed the software, it took about 10 minutes. 

Once installed I fired it up, and BOOM, my son found me and I had to play with him until bed time... 

[Here's a digital photograph of the quick and dirty garage projection setup.](http://i.imgur.com/a2UB3.jpg) 

After the young man in the photo went to bed, it was time to get after it! I grabbed a driver and started swinging. I noticed very quickly that hitting into a solid wall, or garage door, allowed for the ball to fly back at you an incredible speeds. Often hitting me in the face, chest, and penis. It didn't hurt, but unless you are into that freaky shit, it is distracting. Next round I'll hang a white sheet. 

The next thing I noticed was that I was getting good swing speed 108-109mph, I was only driving the ball 120-140 yards. Finally, like a chump, i noticed that I was playing with foam balls. No not the ones on the mat, in my garage, I knew those were foam after the 3rd or 4th time they struck my penis. Normally when I hit golf balls into my penis, I'm bent over in pain after just 2 direct hits. The software actually has a setting for foam balls, vs real balls. I changed the setting, and ahh, my distances are normal again. 

Now I started warming up, taking shots, watching the animations. The practice range was fun, but... 

There's something about seeing a swing speed that makes you want to swing faster. I was able to get up to 140mph swing speeds with three different drivers. I don't have a radar for comparison, but it was crazy how more often than not the swings you think are going to be FAST as FACK, end up at 108, and the swing when your loose, free, and whimsical gets in the upper 130s. 

I had a couple ball flights of over 330 yards. And while it's fun to watch the ball fly, it's not fun to watch it slice. Which happened 4 out of every 5 long drive attempts. Which confirms why I never win those long drive contests at outings, I'm always in the rough. It's easier to play a slice on the optishot however, because your aligned to the same position each time, unlike the real teebox where you have to alter your aiming position and target line. This makes it really fun on say a dog leg 360 yard par 4. 

I played 36 holes, loved every minute of it. The courses were great. At first I enjoyed reaching into my bag for each club, then I got bored of it. I condensed the rotation to a driver, a 6i, a gw, and a putter. 

Warning. I'm sore as balls. I took more swings last night than a range and 18 combined. I feel like my lower back was brutally ridden by Vietnamese lady boys. The pad of my right thumb no longer has a fingerprint. At the end of all this, I wheeled my configuration over the the side of the garage, let the dogs out, and limped upstairs. 

Just to be safe I told my wife I was sore from doing the babysitter, apologized, and went to bed. Goodnight golf, I thought, see you in the morning! 

* Edit 
Putting: 

I have a couple beefs with putting.  Though I can't think of a way to make it better so I'm not complaining, just beefing uncontrollably, like grandpa getting out of a low chair... 

The green shows little white balls and how they would roll, similar to the little pebbles in Tiger Woods. So I see the shot going right to left. Now I'm standing there like a dork with a putter in my hand, and wondering do I put the putter down, walk back to the computer, press the mouse on the arrow key and move my software ""aim"" to the right, or do I adjust my stance and ""slice"" my putter across the ball? If seems that the ""slice version"" may take practice, and may not replicate course conditions. Aligning the put on the software, would then allow you to practice the ""every put IS a straight line"" philosophy I subscribe to.

As far as distance on the green, I never quite got it down in the two rounds. But you can set your green speed an go into practice mode to play on the greens until you have your motion set. Also you can use a real ball, with a pillow in front of you. As you can see from the photo. I used two pillows in a ^ shape, and the balls nestled inside them like wearing shorts on a breezy fall day.  

The putting features include, AUTO (no putting just assumed from distance 1 vs 2 puts), NO GIMMIE (put put put put), AUTO-GIMMIE 6 feet, AUTO-GIMMIE 3 feet. I used the 6 feet version.

I don't know what gave away the fact that I'm not a golfer. It may have been that I have a $30 driver from the thrift store. It may have been that I was in bare feet. It may have been that I couldn't hit it farther than 75 yards...   
  
It doesn't matter. You saw that I was frustrated and needed help, and stopped what you were doing and offered me some advice. Stood there and showed me how to properly grip the club. Where to position my feet. To slow down my swing. You essentially gave me a free lesson, and I can't thank you enough.  
  
I'm just getting into this game, and to say I've been frustrated is a bit of an understatement. There is usually a feeling of competitiveness when I go to the driving range, and lately I've had to force myself to go. Yet I got home yesterday, and just wanted to go hit another bucket. So this morning I was back out there, with my beat-to-shit driver hitting every other shot straight and 200 yards. All thanks to you random old guy. So again, thank you. I think I may go back tonight as well...

** ALL ** matches must be played between August 1st and August 31st. If your scores are not in by August 31st and midnight then you will be left out. 


** The Website **




All information posted here will be mirrored on our event website at http://www.redditgolfopen.com.  You may also make your charitable contributions to The First Tee by following the instructions there.  Once all cities have played their rounds, detailed results of every tournament will be available, as well as event photos and player analytics.




** Scoring ** 




In order for everyone's event to go smoothly, there are some pre-round things we need for GolfLeagueGenius.com a few days in advance of play:




1.  Once you've decided on a course and tee, we need the full scorecard (or a link to where we can find it online). 

2.  At least the captain for each city needs to register for an account with golfleaguegenius.com.  All captains please PM /u/ewhitten with your email address please.  




3.  The captain (or someone logged in as them) should download the GolfLeagueGenius app for either their [iPhone](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/golf-league-genius/id555651262?mt=8) or [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.golftripgenius.android.leaguegenius&amp;amp;hl=en).  This will allow you to upload photos from your event!  We'd ideally like to have a photo of every foursome teeing off, plus shots while you're playing.




4.  As far as entering scores goes, we want hole-by-hole scores for everyone, not just 9/18 hole totals.  This will allow us, if everyone wants, to add on any additional tournaments people are interested in after the fact.  Want a Net Stableford?  Skins?  You name it.  You have two options for submitting scores:

	a.  One person in every foursome has registered on GolfLeagueGenius.com and downloaded the mobile app listed above.  You can now enter scores for all the people in your foursome.  **NOTE** To do this, you must set your foursomes in advance and let /u/ewhitten know at least 24 hours before you play.

	b.  Scan and email your completed scorecards to Bryce at redditopen@gmail.com with the subject line ""Reddit Open - &amp;lt;City&gt; Scorecards"" and let us enter them.  


As far as the donations go... We are requiring a minimum $10 donation. This event benefits The First Tee, making a donation means that your scores will count in all competitions (field, flight, and teams)!  Even if you don't donate, you're still welcome to play! Ask your friends, neighbors, brothers, mothers, sisters etc. They don't even have to play in the 2013 Reddit Open to donate. Let's raise as much money as we can to benefit the sport we all love!


Golf League Genius has a mobile app that allows you to upload pictures right from your phone. We ** HIGHLY ** encourage you guys to upload tons of pictures! Of course we want the obligatory ""everyone on the 1st tee with their drivers"" picture. But give us some funny ones! You're playing partner had to hit a shot left handed out of a bush (you know that pose, we've all been there) we want to see it!


** EMAILS ** WE NEED EMAILS FOR YOU GUYS!!!!


A big thanks to /u/donkey_puncher_eyok for handling most of the roster changes! Also a big thanks to /u/ewhitten for getting the website set up for donations and also putting the roster in to the website! But most of all thanks to the golfers of r/golf, we couldn't have done this without you guys!


Let's go out, play some golf and have some fun. Go get em' guys!


I'm sure I left something out so be on the lookout for some edits. 

EDIT 1: If you have any questions/comments/compliments/complaints etc. don't hesitate to shoot me an email at redditopen@gmail.com. I check that more often than I check my PM's. 


EDIT 2: If you have a small company who would like to sponsor/donate to the 2013 Reddit Open email me at redditopen@gmail.com. You will get a nice ad on the golfleaguegenius website. 

EDIT 3: For any last minute roster changes PM /u/ewhitten. I can't promise anything but it's worth a shot",,False,,t5_2qhcs,1375298152.0,,titleist,True,t3_1jfc4g,http://www.reddit.com/r/golf/comments/1jfc4g/the_2013_reddit_open/,
